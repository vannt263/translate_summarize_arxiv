    "most existing models of accretion disks are based on the @xmath0-prescription of shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) . in this picture ,",
    "the physical nature of the accretion torque is unspecified , and the radial - azimuthal component of the stress tensor , @xmath1 , is assumed to be a constant , @xmath0 , times the pressure .",
    "angular momentum is supposed to be transported outward by an `` anomalous viscosity '' .",
    "the viscosity required by observed evolution timescale is orders of magnitude greater than that resulting from ordinary molecular viscosity .",
    "dimensional analysis suggests that the anomalous viscosity may be represented by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the sound speed and the disk scale height .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that many of the uncertainties regarding the accretion stress are confined in the single parameter @xmath0 .",
    "a promising physical mechanism for anomalous viscosity is turbulence .",
    "how turbulence might be driven has been an open question for many years .",
    "keplerian disks satisfy rayleigh s hydrodynamical stability criterion , as the specific angular momentum increases monotonically outward .",
    "no clear means for locally generating and sustaining hydrodynamic turbulence has been identified .",
    "when a magnetic field is present , however , the condition for stability is that the angular velocity @xmath5 increases outward ( chandrasekhar 1961 ) .",
    "this condition is usually violated in accretion disks .",
    "the presence of a weak magnetic field leads to magnetorotational instability ( mri ; balbus & hawley 1991 ; 1998 ) , which initiates and sustains mhd turbulence .",
    "numerical simulations using several different methods have shown that maxwell and reynolds stresses in the turbulence transport a significant amount of angular momentum outward ( e.g. hawley , gammie , & balbus 1995 ; 1996 ; matsumoto & tajima 1995 ; brandenburg et al .",
    "the maxwell stress is a few times larger than the reynolds stress .    in magnetized accretion disks ,",
    "it is likely that the rate of angular momentum transport and the value of the @xmath0-parameter are determined by the saturation amplitude of the turbulence resulting from mri .",
    "numerical simulations indicate that the time- and volume - averaged maxwell stress , @xmath6 , in the saturated state is usually proportional to the time- and volume - averaged magnetic pressure , @xmath7 ( e.g. , hawley et al . 1995 ; 1996 ) .",
    "therefore it is important to determine how the magnetic pressure depends on the gas pressure , so that we can relate mhd calculations to the many existing studies that use the @xmath0 prescription .",
    "the magnetic pressure is controlled by generation and dissipation processes , and the rate of dissipation may vary with the gas pressure . the main aim of this work is to study how stress depends on gas pressure in turbulence driven by the mri .    in the shakura - sunyaev picture , @xmath0 is the ratio of the accretion stress to the gas pressure .",
    "the saturation level of the @xmath0 parameter ranges from @xmath8  @xmath9 in ideal mhd simulations ( e.g. , hawley et al . 1995 ; 1996 ) .",
    "however , the important questions of how the mri saturates and which physical quantities determine the saturation level have not yet been resolved . the ultimate goal of this work is to understand the mechanism of nonlinear saturation of the mri , so that we may predict the saturation level from a small number of parameters",
    "the first attempts to measure the parameter dependence of the stress numerically were made by hawley et al .",
    "( 1995 ; 1996 ) . they found that the saturation level depends on the field strength , in disks penetrated by uniform vertical fields . on the other hand ,",
    "the final state is independent of the initial field strength if there is no net magnetic flux in the system .",
    "a single initial gas pressure was used in all the calculations , so that the pressure dependence of the saturation level was not addressed . here",
    "we extend the work of hawley et al .",
    "( 1995 ; 1996 ) .",
    "we reexamine the predictor function , explicitly considering the pressure dependence .",
    "the calculations are run for hundreds of orbits for accurate estimation of saturation levels .",
    "the gas pressure dependence of the saturated stress remains unclear .",
    "no numerical experiment has explicitly examined the dependence . however",
    ", there is indirect evidence that higher gas pressures may enhance the maxwell stress .",
    "stone et al .",
    "( 1996 ) carried out three - dimensional simulations of the mri in a vertically stratified disk using both adiabatic and isothermal equations of state . in the adiabatic case ,",
    "temperatures increase with time due to dissipation of magnetic energy , while in the isothermal version , the temperature is constant .",
    "the pressures in the nonlinear regime differ substantially between the two .",
    "the saturation level in the adiabatic run is higher than in the isothermal run with the same initial condition , suggesting that higher pressures may contribute to higher saturation levels of the stress .",
    "however the calculations include stratification , so that buoyancy as well as gas pressure may affect the saturated state .",
    "the effects of gas pressure are studied separately in the present paper by using the unstratified shearing box approximation ( hawley et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "another advantage of unstratified local simulations is that the evolution can be followed for many orbits .",
    "turbulence driven by the mri is fluctuating and chaotic ( winters , balbus , & hawley 2003 ) , and averages must be taken over long intervals for reliable estimates of the saturation level . most of our simulations are integrated for a few hundred orbits , and time averages are taken over more than 50 orbits .",
    "these periods are long compared with previous work using similar calculations .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows .",
    "the basic equations and initial conditions are described in   2 .",
    "we make the local shearing box approximation , in which total energy increases over time because of the radial boundary conditions .",
    "energy transfer and thermalization in the shearing box are also discussed briefly in   2 .",
    "numerical results are shown in   3 .",
    "the parameters defining the initial condition in the local approximation are the gas pressure , the geometry and strength of the magnetic field , the equation of state , the size of the calculation box , and the numerical resolution .",
    "the effects of all parameters must be understood to construct a saturation predictor function . however in this paper , we concentrate on the gas pressure , magnetic field , and equation of state .",
    "the remaining parameters will be investigated in subsequent work .",
    "the evolution of the mri in disks with zero and non - zero net magnetic flux is examined in    3.1 and 3.2 ,",
    "the effects of magnetic dissipation are discussed in   3.3 , while ",
    "3.4 is devoted to general characteristics of mhd turbulence driven by the mri .",
    "time variability of the turbulence and the interpretation of our numerical results are discussed in ",
    "4 . finally ,   5 is a brief summary .",
    "the shearing box approximation is used in our numerical simulations , because we focus on the local behavior of the mri in the simplest representation of accretion disks .",
    "the vertical gravity is ignored so that all the physical quantities are initially uniform except for the sheared velocity in the azimuthal direction .",
    "the equations to be solved are @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the current density and @xmath15 is the specific internal energy .",
    "the basic equations are written in a local cartesian frame of reference ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) corotating with the disk at angular frequency @xmath5 , where @xmath16 is oriented in the radial direction , @xmath17 is in the azimuthal direction , and @xmath18 is in the vertical direction .",
    "the terms @xmath19 and @xmath20 in the equation of motion ( [ eqn : eom ] ) are the coriolis force and the tidal expansion of the effective potential with a constant @xmath21 for a keplerian disk , respectively .",
    "the gas is assumed to be ideal , with pressure @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the ratio of the specific heats . in this paper",
    ", we examine both the ideal mhd and resistive mhd cases .",
    "the induction equation ( [ eqn : ineq ] ) includes a term for the ohmic dissipation , where @xmath24 is the magnetic diffusivity .",
    "the energy equation ( [ eqn : ene ] ) has the joule heating term .",
    "these equations are solved with the second - order godunov - type scheme developed by t. sano & s. inutsuka ( 2004 , in preparation ) .",
    "operator splitting is used .",
    "the hydrodynamical part of the equations is solved by a godunov method , using the exact solution of the simplified mhd riemann problem .",
    "the riemann problem is simplified by including only the tangential component of the field .",
    "the characteristic velocity is then that of the magneto - sonic wave alone , and the mhd riemann problem can be solved in a way similar to the hydrodynamical one ( colella & woodward 1984 ) .",
    "the piecewise linear distributions of flow quantities are calculated with a monotonicity constraint following van leer s ( 1979 ) method .",
    "the remaining terms , the magnetic tension component of the equation of motion and the induction equation , are solved by the moc - ct method ( stone & norman 1992 ) , guaranteeing @xmath25 to within round - off error throughout the calculation ( evans & hawley 1988 ) .",
    "the accuracy of the scheme has been demonstrated by various test problems and by calculations of the numerical growth rate of the mri ( sano 1998 ; sano & stone 2002a ) .",
    "the inclusion of the ohmic dissipation term into the ct method is straightforward . for ideal mhd ,",
    "the electro - motive force , @xmath26 , is defined at the edge of each cell . for resistive mhd",
    ", we evaluate the current density @xmath27 at the same position , and calculate a new electro - motive force including the dissipation term , @xmath28 .",
    "the energy equation can be solved in either the total energy or the internal energy form . in most cases",
    "we use the conservative , total energy form because it allows a more complete analysis of the energy budget . in saturated turbulence driven by the mri ,",
    "the main source of heating is magnetic dissipation ( sano & inutsuka 2001 ) . under non - conservative numerical schemes ,",
    "magnetic energy can be lost from the system , leading to time increases in gas pressure that are slower than obtained using a total energy scheme .",
    "we use the internal energy scheme in a few models for comparing with the results of the total energy scheme .      in the initial equilibrium ,",
    "the tidal force in the local effective potential balances the coriolis force , and both are much greater than magnetic forces .",
    "the relative importance of the field is given by the ratio between the gas and magnetic pressures ; @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the sound velocity and alfvn speed . the initial plasma beta @xmath32 is larger than 100 for all the models shown in this paper .",
    "the initial distribution of the azimuthal velocity is given by @xmath33 .",
    "the uniform density and gas pressure are assumed to be @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively .    because the evolution of the mri is sensitive to whether the net flux of the vertical field is zero or finite , we consider two kinds of initial field geometries : a uniform vertical field @xmath36 and a field with zero net flux , @xmath37 . here",
    "@xmath38 is the size of the shearing box in the radial direction .",
    "the system of equations is normalized using the initial density ( @xmath39 ) and the angular velocity ( @xmath40 ) , following hawley et al .",
    "however , lengths are normalized differently from previous studies so that the gas pressure dependence of the saturation level may be examined .",
    "the local shearing box has three possible scales of length : the pressure scale height @xmath41 , the unstable wavelength of the mri @xmath42 , and the size of the box . here",
    "@xmath43 and @xmath44 are the initial sound velocity and alfvn speed .",
    "while lengths in previous work are normalized by @xmath45 , we choose the vertical height of the box @xmath46 as the unit length .",
    "then both the gas pressure @xmath35 and the field strength @xmath47 are independent parameters , and determine the ratios @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "note that the ratio of the box size to the disk thickness @xmath45 depends on the choice of initial gas pressure @xmath35 in this normalization .",
    "the radial and azimuthal sizes of the shearing box are taken to be @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the primary goal of this paper is to understand the dependence of the saturation level on physical quantities . for this purpose",
    ", we perform a few extreme models in which the box size exceeds the pressure scale height of the disk , or the gas pressure increases by three orders of magnitude from its initial value .",
    "care must be taken when applying the results to real accretion disks .",
    "spatially uncorrelated perturbations in the gas pressure and azimuthal velocity are imposed at the beginning of each calculation .",
    "the fluctuations have a zero mean value with a maximum amplitude of @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the amplitude of the initial fluctuations is less than 1 % , because @xmath54 .",
    "most of the calculations use a standard grid resolution of @xmath55 with uniform zoning . in the azimuthal and vertical direction ,",
    "periodic boundary conditions are used .",
    "for the radial boundary , a sheared periodic boundary condition ( hawley et al . 1995 ) is adopted .      in the shearing box",
    ", angular momentum is transported by maxwell and reynolds stresses , with sum @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the deviation from the background shear motion .",
    "the stress @xmath58 is closely related to the total energy within the box defined as @xmath59   \\label{eq : etotal}\\ ] ] ( hawley et al . 1995 ) , where @xmath60 is the tidal expansion of the effective potential . using the evolution equations for the resistive mhd system [ eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : eoc ] )  ( [ eqn : ineq ] ) ] , the time - derivative of the above equation gives @xmath61 \\right .",

    "thus the rate of energy input through the sheared periodic radial boundary is proportional to the stress @xmath58 at the boundary .",
    "note that the final expression of equation ( [ eq : detdt ] ) does not explicitly depend on the resistivity .",
    "if the stress @xmath58 at the boundary is positive , or the angular momentum flux through the box is outward , the total energy of the system increases .",
    "the source of the injected energy is the background shear motion . in realistic disks ,",
    "positive stresses lead to inward mass accretion , bringing a loss of gravitational energy .",
    "the gain in total energy in the shearing box represents this energy release .",
    "the injected energy goes to the magnetic field due to the growth of mri .",
    "magnetic energy is then thermalized via magnetic reconnection .    in saturated turbulence , the time - averaged magnetic and kinetic energies",
    "are nearly constant .",
    "furthermore , the density varies little , so that the change in potential energy @xmath63 is negligible compared with the other terms in equation ( [ eq : etotal ] ) .",
    "all the energy gain of the system is therefore finally deposited by the thermal energy @xmath64 , and equation ( [ eq : detdt ] ) can be written as @xmath65 where the double brackets @xmath66 denote time- and volume - averaged quantities .",

    "] this _ fluctuation - dissipation relation _ has been clearly demonstrated in numerical simulations ( sano & inutsuka 2001 ) .",

    "if cooling processes are inefficient and the stress @xmath68 is constant , the gas pressure increases linearly with time .",
    "the time evolution is approximately given by @xmath69 assuming @xmath70 and @xmath71 , the plasma beta would evolve as @xmath72 here we use a relation @xmath73 obtained in previous numerical simulations ( e.g. , hawley et al .",
    "equation ( [ eqn : beta ] ) indicates that after a hundred orbits , the plasma beta must be larger than a few hundred , even though the first term on the right hand side of equation ( [ eqn : beta ] ) can be much smaller .",
    "the change in gas pressure over 100 orbits can be large , and should be taken into account in analyzing the effects of gas pressure .",
    "in realistic situations , however , the gas pressure can be reduced by radiative cooling or by expansion in the vertical direction . instead of including cooling processes",
    ", we examine the effects of cooling simply by changing the ratio of the specific heats @xmath23 . for nearly isothermal simulations , we use @xmath74 , while @xmath71 is used for adiabatic simulations .",

    "the short - term variability of mri - driven turbulence is chaotic ( winters et al .",

    "instead of implementing cooling terms in numerical simulations , we demonstrate the effects of cooling processes simply by changing the ratio of the specific heats @xmath23 .",
    "nearly isothermal models with @xmath74 are listed in table 1 . in general , the maxwell stress in the `` isothermal '' run is smaller than that in the adiabatic run .",
    "for example , the saturation level of the maxwell stress for model s52i is @xmath128 , which is less than half of that for the adiabatic counterpart s52 . for model s52 ,",
    "the gas pressure at the end of the calculation is 30 times larger than @xmath35 .",
    "the difference in the stresses may be due to an effect of the enhanced gas pressure .",

    "in contrast to the adiabatic models , the time - averaged stress in the `` isothermal '' models is found to be almost constant with time . the time average is taken from 50 to 300 orbits , and the error bars in the figure show the dispersions of time averages taken every 50 orbits .",
    "the dotted line in the figure is the @xmath130-@xmath131 relation obtained from the adiabatic runs ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wmpbz ] ) .",
    "the `` isothermal '' runs with the higher initial pressure @xmath35 have larger saturation amplitude in the stress .",
    "furthermore the relation between @xmath131 and @xmath35 in the `` isothermal '' runs is exactly the same as the @xmath130-@xmath131 relation in the adiabatic calculations .",
    "this fact indicates that the pressure - stress relation is robust and unrelated to the time - dependent behavior of the shearing box .",
    "it is worth noticing that the horizontal axis of figure  [ fig : wmgpbz ] is @xmath132 . in terms of the comparison with incompressible mhd turbulence",
    ", the dependence on @xmath23 has an important meaning .",
    "the dependence on the gas pressure is very weak and the difference in @xmath23 between the adiabatic ( @xmath71 ) and `` isothermal '' ( @xmath74 ) models is quite small .",
    "therefore it is difficult to distinguish the dependence on @xmath133 and @xmath132 . to see the difference more clearly",
    ", we consider rather extreme cases with @xmath134 ( s52 g and s62 g ) , which are shown by blue symbols in the figure . except for @xmath23 ,",
    "their model parameters are identical to s52 and s62 , respectively . for each model ,",
    "three time averages over successive 50-orbit periods are shown .",
    "although the range in the gas pressure is not so wide , a net increase of the saturation level with time can be seen in both models . if @xmath132 is used as the horizontal axis , the time - averaged stress in s52 g and s62 g is closer to the fitting function of the @xmath135 runs ( _ dotted line _ ) . to verify the @xmath23 dependence ,",

    "the mri may be interesting , but is beyond the scope of this paper .      in this subsection",
    ", we examine the numerical resolution needed to obtain a correct pressure - stress relation . because the magnetic energy is proportional to the maxwell stress in mhd turbulence ,",

    "the saturation level of models s52i and s62i is on the dotted line .",
    "however , the lower pressure models ( s51i and s62i ) are located far below the predicted line .",
    "mhd turbulence in these two models decays in the late stages of the evolution , and the magnetic energy decreases with time .    because the density is almost uniform even in the nonlinear regime",
    ", the volume - averaged magnetic energy can be regarded as the root - mean - square ( rms ) of the mri wavelength , @xmath138 throughout the paper , the mri wavelength is calculated from the vertical component of the magnetic field because the fastest growing mode of the mri , the axisymmetric mode , is characterized by the vertical field strength .",
    "the rms of the mri wavelength is shorter when the gas pressure is lower , if the saturation level of the magnetic energy is proportional to @xmath115 .",
    "the numerical resolution in terms of the mri wavelength is then poorer at lower gas pressures .",
    "the gap between models s61i and s52i suggests that there is a minimum resolution at which the correct @xmath130-@xmath131 relation is obtained .    the horizontal dot - dashed line in figure  [ fig : bzpe ] indicates where the rms of the mri wavelength is 6 grid zones .",
    "therefore , the mri wavelength must be resolved by at least 6 grid zones to avoid the decay of mhd turbulence due to numerical diffusion and to obtain the predicted saturation level .",
    "if @xmath139 , the characteristics of the turbulence are quite different from those in well - resolved models . for example , the reynolds stress in models s51i and s61i is larger than the maxwell stress , while the maxwell stress dominates the reynolds stress in all the other models ( see table 1 ) .",
    "this can also be seen when the ohmic dissipation is effective ( fleming , stone , & hawley 2000 ; sano & stone 2002b ) .",
    "the condition on numerical resolution may be useful not only for the local shearing box simulations but also for global disk simulations .",
    "figure  [ fig : bzpe ] includes results obtained using a different numerical scheme .",
    "open squares are from models s51e , s61e , s52e , and s62e , which are solved using an internal energy scheme that does not conserve total energy .",
    "the thermal energy increases more slowly due to energy losses from the system .",
    "for example , the gas pressure in models s52 and s52e at 300 orbits is @xmath140 and 3 , respectively .",
    "however , the @xmath141-@xmath142 relation is found to be unchanged , i.e. , independent of the type of numerical scheme .",
    "the saturation level of the stress in the models solved by the internal energy scheme is always slightly smaller than the results of the total energy scheme ( see table 1 ) .",
    "but the difference can be explained clearly by the difference in gas pressure , if the power - law relation is taken into account .",
    "further evidence of the resolution limit can be seen in the time evolution of model s51e . because this model is solved by the non - conservative scheme ,",
    "the increase of the gas pressure is slow .",
    "crosses in the figure mark the time averages for model s51e that are taken over every 50 orbits after 50 orbits .",
    "when the gas pressure is low and the predicted saturation level is below the resolution limit , the magnetic energy is much lower than the dotted line .",
    "however , as the gas pressure increases and the predicted level exceeds the limit , the time - averaged magnetic energy starts to follow the predicted dotted line .",
    "this behavior indicates that we need at least about 6 grid zones per mri wavelength to resolve mhd turbulence driven by the mri .",
    "the effects of the field geometry are examined in this section .",
    "the magnetic field structures in accretion disks are difficult to observe , and remain poorly known .",
    "therefore it is important to survey different possible field geometries and understand the effects on the nonlinear evolution of the mri .",
    "if the disk is penetrated by a dipole field of the central object , or by a global field of the surrounding interstellar medium , there may be a net vertical flux .",
    "here we consider models beginning with a uniform vertical field .",
    "the vertical flux is conserved in the shearing box , so that a seed field for the mri is always present if it is present initially .",
    "previous numerical work ( hawley et al . 1995 ; 1996 ; sano & stone 2002b ) has shown that the existence of a net vertical flux greatly affects the nonlinear evolution of the mri .",
    "for example , the saturation level of the stress depends on the strength of the uniform field , although the quantitative relation is not confirmed yet .",
    "the stress is reported to be proportional to @xmath75 ( hawley et al .",
    "1995 ) and to @xmath143 ( sano , inutsuka , & miyama 1998 ; turner et al .",
    "2003 ) . because the saturation amplitude may depend on several physical quantities simultaneously ,",
    "it is necessary to understand all the effects in order to extract the separate contributions of the field strength and gas pressure .",
    "therefore , we scrutinize the dependence of the saturation amplitude on the physical quantities as well as the effects of the field geometry .      first , there is a weak power - law relation between the gas pressure and the maxwell stress for uniform @xmath75 models .",
    "the relation is very similar to that seen in the zero net flux models . in figure",
    "[ fig : wmpz ] , the saturation level of the maxwell stress is shown as a function of the gas pressure .",

    "the saturation level of the stress shows a weak dependence on @xmath133 .",

    "the pressure - stress relation of the zero net flux models is shown by the solid line in the figure .",
    "all the results from the uniform @xmath75 models lie above the solid line , that is , the saturation level is always higher than in the zero net flux models .",
    "a power - law relation can be seen for the other @xmath44 models as well .",
    "the power - law index is slightly smaller than , or comparable to , that of the zero net flux models .",
    "figure  [ fig : wmpz ] includes the `` isothermal '' cases . in general , the saturation level of the stress in the `` isothermal '' models is a few times smaller than in the adiabatic counterparts . because of the large stress , the increase of the gas pressure is dramatic in the adiabatic models [ see eq .",
    "( [ eqn : pt ] ) ] . for model z51 , for example",
    ", the gas pressure at the end of the calculation is 3 orders of magnitude higher than the initial value .",
    "the gas pressure in the nonlinear regime is many times larger than in the isothermal model ( z51i ) .",
    "therefore the maxwell stress with respect to @xmath116 ( i.e. , the @xmath0 parameter ) has a huge difference between the adiabatic and `` isothermal '' runs ; @xmath158 in z51 while @xmath159 in z51i . for the uniform @xmath75 cases , the @xmath0 parameter ranges widely from @xmath127 to 1 ( see table 2 ) .",
    "the magnitude of the plasma beta is approximately given by the inverse of the @xmath0 parameter .",
    "the plasma beta values in the nonlinear regime span a wide range , from 10 to @xmath160 , and there is no characteristic amplitude .      as is expected , the saturation level of the stress is larger for stronger initial fields .",
    "since the stress has a dependence on the gas pressure as well as the field strength , both effects should be taken into account at the same time . from the results shown in figure  [",
    "fig : wmpz ] , the saturation level of the maxwell stress is approximately given by @xmath161 using the gas pressure in the nonlinear regime @xmath116 and the initial field strength @xmath44 .",
    "this is plotted in the figure by dotted lines for models z4 * ( @xmath149 ) , z5 * ( @xmath151 ) , and z6 * ( @xmath153 ) . here , z4 * , z5 * , and z6 *",

    "for example , z6 * includes z61 , z62 , z63 , z61i , and z62i .",
    "the relation shown by each dotted line is valid only for one value of the initial field strength .",
    "we find that there is an upper and a lower limit to the saturation level for the uniform @xmath75 runs .",
    "the precise dependence on the field strength is difficult to measure because of the small range between the limits .",
    "the origins of the limits are discussed in the next subsection .",
    "we perform an additional numerical experiment to demonstrate the importance of the amount of net magnetic flux .",
    "so far the initial field is assumed to be uniform everywhere in the computational domain .",
    "however , model z62p has an initially uniform field that is localized within a small part of the domain . at the beginning , the magnetic field",
    "is confined to @xmath164 and @xmath165 , and fills one quarter of the volume of the box . the field strength and",
    "the other parameters are exactly the same as model z62 .",
    "the time evolution of the magnetic energy density is illustrated in figure  [ fig : p24 ] by a slice in the @xmath16-@xmath18 plane at @xmath166 . the radial pattern at 2 orbits ( fig .  [ fig : p24 ] , _ top - right panel _ )",
    "is formed due to the background shear motion , but the field is still confined within @xmath167 . then the magnetized region starts to spread in the radial direction as a result of the mri .",
    "the most unstable wavelength is 0.31 in this case , so that the characteristic wavelength at 3 orbits ( _ middle - right panel _ )",
    "is consistent with the prediction of the linear analysis .",
    "when the generated horizontal field reaches nonlinear amplitude , the linear growth of the mri is disrupted by magnetic reconnection . through diffusion effects , the mass fraction of the magnetized region increases . finally , at 3.5 orbits ( _ bottom - left panel _ ) the whole domain is filled with amplified magnetic field and becomes turbulent . the turbulence is sustained throughout the calculation .",
    "the saturation level of the maxwell stress in model z62p is indicated by the red cross in figure  [ fig : wmpz ] .",
    "the initial field strength in this model is the same as in models z6 * ( @xmath153 ) , while the total magnetic flux is equal to that of models z4 * ( @xmath149 ) .",
    "the stress in z62p is much smaller than in models z6 * , and comparable to models z4*. thus the key quantity of the uniform vertical field is its total flux , or average strength over the entire system .",
    "this simple numerical experiment yields two interesting results .",
    "first , if even a small part of the disk has a magnetic field , the field can spread due to the shear motion of the disk and the growth of the mri .",
    "second , the saturation amplitude is determined by the total vertical flux .      in general ,",
    "saturation levels are higher for larger vertical magnetic fluxes .",
    "however this relation has an upper and a lower limit .",
    "figure  [ fig : btz ] shows the time evolution of the magnetic energy for models z32 ( @xmath168 ) , z62 ( @xmath169 ) , and z92 ( @xmath170 ) .",
    "the initial magnetic field in model z32 is 4 times weaker than in z62 , and 16 times weaker than in z92 .",
    "the field is amplified by many orders of magnitude in the lower @xmath47 models ( z32 and z62 ) .",
    "the magnetic energies in z62 are greater than in z32 , both initially and in the nonlinear regime . on the other hand ,",
    "no amplification is seen in model z92 .",
    "the reason for this behavior is explained as follows .",
    "the shortest unstable wavelength of the mri , or critical wavelength , is proportional to the alfvn speed .",
    "the critical wavelength is longer for stronger initial fields .",
    "when the critical wavelength exceeds the disk scale height , linear growth of the mri can no longer be expected .",
    "this gives the upper limit to the field strength .",
    "the critical wavelength in model z92 is initially longer than the vertical size of the box : @xmath171 .",
    "the model is magnetorotationally stable , because the magnetic tension suppresses the linear growth of the mri .",
    "model z92 ( _ dotted line _ ) shows no growth in the magnetic energy .",
    "the volume - averaged magnetic energy in model z62 fluctuates greatly with time .",
    "the amplitude is almost an order of magnitude .",
    "the fluctuations are a typical feature of calculations with a net vertical magnetic flux . during the saturated turbulent phase , field amplification due to the growth of a channel solution",
    "occurs quasi - periodically , and is followed by dissipation through magnetic reconnection ( sano & inutsuka 2001 ) . in weaker @xmath47 models",
    ", on the other hand , the two - channel flow appears less often , and the time variations are of smaller amplitudes .",
    "if the net vertical flux is less than a critical value , the saturation level of the stress approaches that of the zero net flux results .    in figure",
    "[ fig : wmpz ] , the pressure - stress relation obtained from the zero net flux runs is shown by a solid line . the field strength in models z3 * ( @xmath147 )",
    "is half that in models z4 * ( @xmath149 ) .",
    "the field in models z1 * ( @xmath145 ) is 8 times weaker than in models z4*. however the differences in the stress are small , and the weaker field results are almost on the solid line .",
    "this fact suggests that the saturation amplitude of the zero net flux runs gives the minimum level .",
    "the recurrent growth of the channel flow enhances the saturation level of the stress when the disk has a vertical flux .",
    "the enhancement is seen only when the field strength is large enough that the initial mri wavelength @xmath81 corresponds to at least several percent of the system size .",
    "the two - channel flow appears if the vertical field is amplified such that the mri wavelength corresponds to the vertical box size .",
    "the vertical field must be amplified by a larger factor to produce the channel flow if the initial field is weaker .",
    "thus the appearance of the two - channel flow is rarer in the weaker initial field models . within the region of parameter space we explored ,",
    "the zero net flux models and the weak uniform field models show the same level of saturation in the maxwell stress . for those models ,",
    "the power - law index in the pressure - stress relation is about 1/4 .",
    "if the mri wavelength of the initial uniform field is longer than about one tenth of the vertical box size , the appearance of the two - channel flow enhances the saturation level of the stress . in this parameter regime ,",
    "the saturation amplitude is roughly proportional to @xmath172 , and the power - law index is slightly smaller ( @xmath173 1/6 ) .",
    "the upper limit on the saturation level is given by a condition that the mri wavelength corresponding to the uniform vertical field should be smaller than the vertical domain size .    even in cases with the most unstable wavelength",
    "initially less than the grid size ( e.g. , model z13 ) , the longer - wavelength unstable modes can be resolved .",
    "furthermore the characteristic wavelength in the nonlinear stage is longer because of the amplification of the field .",
    "thus the resolution condition discussed in   [ sec : res ] is satisfied in the saturated state in all the models shown in figure  [ fig : wmpz ] .",
    "dissipation of the magnetic field may play an important role in determining the saturation level of the mri , because magnetic reconnection occurs frequently during the saturated turbulent phase .",
    "the ideal mhd approximation is made in all the calculations listed in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "due to numerical diffusion , magnetic reconnection occurs even in the ideal mhd simulations . in this section ,",
    "we briefly examine the effects of physical dissipation . the ohmic dissipation term is explicitly included when solving the induction equation .",
    "two types of resistivity are considered : a time - constant and spatially uniform value @xmath174 , and an anomalous resistivity .",
    "the anomalous diffusivity adopted varies as @xmath175 for @xmath176 and @xmath177 for @xmath178 , where @xmath179 is the drift velocity , and @xmath180 and @xmath181 are parameters .",
    "this prescription is based on the idea that current - driven instabilities enhance the effective diffusivity , and has been used in many astrophysical simulations ( e.g. , yokoyama & shibata 1994 ; machida & matsumoto 2003 ) .",
    "table 3 lists the resistive models , including both those with zero net flux and those with uniform vertical initial fields .",
    "the size of the ohmic dissipation is indicated by the magnetic reynolds number @xmath182 , where @xmath183 and @xmath184 are typical velocity and length scales . for the mri ,",
    "typical scales are the alfvn speed @xmath185 and the most unstable wavelength @xmath186 .",
    "the magnetic reynolds number is then @xmath187 .",
    "linear and nonlinear evolution of the mri is characterized very well using the parameter @xmath188 ( sano & miyama 1999 ; sano & stone 2002b ) .",
    "dissipation effects are better - resolved for larger @xmath24 .",
    "however , ohmic dissipation suppresses the mri if the diffusivity is too large .",
    "the critical value of the initial magnetic reynolds number is about 10 for zero net flux cases ( sano & stone 2002b ) .",
    "actually , mhd turbulence dies away in 100 orbits when a uniform diffusivity is added to models s51 and s52 with @xmath189 , corresponding to @xmath190 .",
    "therefore we choose @xmath191 ( @xmath192 ) for the uniform diffusivity in zero net flux models . for uniform @xmath75 cases , on the other hand",
    ", the critical @xmath193 is about unity ( sano & stone 2002b ) .",
    "thus the diffusivity for models z51r , z52r , z53r , and z52ir is assumed to be @xmath194 , corresponding to @xmath195 . for cases with anomalous diffusivity , we take @xmath196 and @xmath197 , because the mean value of @xmath24 in the nonlinear regime in regions with @xmath176 is then a few times @xmath198 in the zero net flux models , and a few times @xmath199 in the uniform @xmath75 models .",
    "the pressure - stress relations in the resistive runs are shown in figure  [ fig : eta]@xmath93 ( zero net flux @xmath75 ) and [ fig : eta]@xmath94 ( uniform @xmath75 ) together with the ideal mhd results ( @xmath118 ) .",

    "model parameters in the resistive runs are identical to these ideal mhd models except for the magnetic diffusivity .",
    "a positive correlation can be seen for both the uniform ( @xmath200 ) and anomalous diffusivity runs ( @xmath201 ) .",
    "the saturation amplitude in the resistive runs is slightly lower than that in the @xmath177 cases .",
    "but the difference is at most a factor of 3 , because the dependence on the diffusivity is weak when the magnetic reynolds number is larger than unity ( sano & stone 2002b ) .",
    "the dotted lines in the figure indicate the power - law relation @xmath202 with @xmath203 ( fig .",

    "this scale is well - resolved initially because @xmath206 . in the nonlinear regime ,",
    "the average diffusion length is still larger than the grid scale ( @xmath207 ) .",
    "however , because of the severe constraint on the initial @xmath193 , the diffusion length in the zero net flux models is shorter than the grid scale ( @xmath208 ) .",
    "we therefore carried out double - resolution versions of the calculations shown in figure  [ fig : eta]a , using @xmath209 zones .",
    "the dependence on the gas pressure is qualitatively unaffected by the change in the numerical resolution .",
    "we conclude that the weak power - law relation between the gas pressure and the maxwell stress exists for both the ideal and resistive mhd cases .",

    "on the other hand , the magnetic pressure can be comparable to the gas pressure .    for both the adiabatic and `` isothermal '' cases ,",
    "the fluctuation in @xmath224 is independent of @xmath225 and near unity , if the magnetic pressure is lower than the gas pressure . if @xmath226 , then the fluctuation is slightly less .",
    "taking account of the compressibility , the linear growth rate of the axisymmetric mri is reduced when the toroidal component of the magnetic pressure is comparable to the gas pressure ( blaes & balbus 1994 ; kim & ostriker 2000 ) .",

    "the density fluctuation , on the other hand , is proportional to the ratio of magnetic to gas pressure . in the adiabatic cases the density is almost spatially uniform ( _ filled symbols _ ) , because the magnetic pressure is much less than the gas pressure in the saturated state . only when @xmath224 is comparable to @xmath227 do order unity density fluctuations occur .",

    "although the density fluctuation and magnetic pressure are time - dependent , the variations move the model along the same relations in this diagram .",
    "the amplitude of density fluctuations in mri turbulence is found to be given by @xmath230 this relation is valid for all the models we performed .",

    "the perturbed magnetic energy is defined as @xmath231 .",
    "the disturbances in kinetic and magnetic energies shown in figure  [ fig : dek ] both originate from unstable modes of the mri , and the two are roughly equal throughout the saturated turbulence .",
    "the thermal energy of the perturbations , on the other hand , is not in equipartition , and is comparable to or less than the magnetic energy .",
    "figure  [ fig : det ] shows the thermal energy of the disturbances as a function of the magnetic energy .",
    "the size of the thermal disturbances is estimated using the internal energy of sound waves @xmath232 ( e.g. , landau & lifshitz 1959 ) .",

    ".    the large variations in the uniform vertical field cases result from recurrent growth of the two - channel flow .",
    "this flow arises from a linearly unstable mri mode , and is an exact solution of the full nonlinear mhd equations in the incompressible limit ( goodman & xu 1994 ) .",

    "the vertical dotted line in the figure indicates where the rms of the mri wavelength , @xmath237 , equals the box height .",
    "time variations of order unity occur in models with @xmath238 . when the mri wavelength is shorter , the growth of unstable modes and the dissipation by reconnection occur in multiple small regions simultaneously , and the overall time variations are smoother .",
    "the characteristics of the time variation illustrated in figure  [ fig : dispbzall ] are little changed by the inclusion of magnetic diffusivity and by increases in numerical resolution up to @xmath239 .",
    "the observed amplitudes of x - ray variability in black - hole candidates and active galactic nuclei are typically about 0.3 ( e.g. , nowak et al .",
    "1999 ; papadakis et al .",
    "local stress variations of similar size may occur if the mri wavelength is an order of magnitude shorter than the disk thickness .",

    "the power spectrum is a tool used to make comparisons with observations .",
    "power spectral density ( psd ) may be calculated from the history of the volume - averaged stress .",
    "kawaguchi et al . ( 2000 ) found in global disk mhd simulations that the psd of the stress has a shape similar to the psd of the x - ray flux in observations of black - hole candidates .",
    "figure  [ fig : npsd ] shows the psd for three models z62r ( strong uniform field ) , z32r ( weak uniform field ) , and s62r ( zero net flux ) .",
    "they are calculated from the history of the maxwell stress measured at intervals @xmath240 . the normalized psd shown in figure  [ fig : npsd ]",
    "are obtained by the following procedure .",
    "the history data from 50 to 300 orbits is divided into 8 intervals of about 30 orbits each .",
    "the psd is calculated for each segment and the amplitude is normalized by the squared time - average of the stress of each term .",
    "then the psd averaged over these 8 spectra is shown in the figure .",
    "the error bars are standard errors @xmath241 of the 8 segments .",
    "note that the bottom two models in the figure are shifted downward to avoid overlapping ; the amplitude of the spectrum is multiplied by @xmath242 and @xmath127 for model z32r and s62r , respectively .",
    "a uniform diffusivity @xmath243 is used in model z62r .",
    "the diffusion length is @xmath244 , and the effects of ohmic dissipation may be adequately resolved .",
    "mri turbulence is prevented by diffusion if the magnetic reynolds number , defined using the mri wavelength and the alfvn speed , is less than unity ( sano & stone 2002b ) . in model z32r , a diffusivity @xmath245 corresponds to magnetic reynolds number 0.039 . for sustained turbulence in model z32r",
    ", we therefore use a lower diffusivity @xmath191 , corresponding to @xmath246 and @xmath247 .",
    "the psd of the weak uniform field ( z32r ) and zero net flux ( s62r ) models are quite similar , as are the amplitudes of the time variability ( fig .",

    "the strong uniform field model ( z62r ) exhibits large time variations with quasi - periodic spike - shaped excursions .",
    "the psd of this model has a steeper slope near the orbital frequency than the other models .",
    "the power - law indexes @xmath248 ( psd @xmath249 ) of the spectra are listed in table 5 . because the spectra are not well fit by single power - laws , the indexes are calculated for three different frequency ranges . the indexes for the ideal mhd and anomalous diffusivity models are also listed for purposes of comparison . in all the models ,",
    "the psd is steepest in the middle frequency range @xmath250 , and shallowest in the lower frequency range @xmath251 .    basically , the time variation of the stress in the mri turbulence consists of repeated exponential growth and exponential decay .",
    "the psd of a simple exponential function is flat at low frequencies and proportional to @xmath252 at high frequencies .",
    "this feature can be seen at the higher and lower frequencies in the spectra shown in figure  [ fig : npsd ] .",
    "the power - law indexes in the higher range @xmath253 are close to 2 , and the variation is flattest in the lower range @xmath251 .",
    "however the slope is much steeper than @xmath254 in the middle range @xmath250 .",
    "this is because the exponential growth and decay are truncated after finite intervals .",
    "the typical period of the spike - shaped variation is a few orbits , and the psd is enhanced near the corresponding frequency .",
    "armitage & reynolds ( 2003 ) find similar features in the temporal power spectrum of a local annulus in a global disk simulation .",
    "x - ray observations of black - hole candidates and active galactic nuclei exhibit a power - law decline with a shallower index @xmath255  2 ( e.g. , nowak et al .",
    "1999 ; papadakis et al .",
    "this suggests again that global disk simulations may be necessary for comparison with observed time variability .",
    "the time variations in stress mostly consist of brief periods of exponential growth and decay .",
    "the rates of growth and decay of the maxwell stress can be estimated approximately by the following method . from the history of the volume - averaged stress @xmath256 sampled at regular intervals , we select local extrema @xmath257 , where @xmath258/[w ( t_{i } ) - w ( t_{i-1 } ) ] < 0 $ ] .",
    "the extrema occur at times @xmath259 .",
    "the rate of change between the @xmath260-th extremum and the next is calculated by @xmath261 where a positive ( negative ) sign for @xmath262 indicates growth ( decay ) . when the time between peaks is short , the change in stress is small .",
    "we ignore intervals less than @xmath263 .",
    "histograms of the growth and decay rates are shown in figure  [ fig : omegahist ] for models z62r , z32r , and s62r .",
    "the weak uniform field model ( z32r ) and zero net flux model ( s62r ) have quite similar distributions , symmetric between growth and decay .",
    "by contrast the distribution for model z62r is obviously asymmetric . as mentioned above , turbulence in models",
    "z32r and s62r is disorganized , and the growth and decay of perturbations in different parts of the simulation volume are uncorrelated .",
    "when averaged over the many perturbations present , the stress varies less with time than in each individual perturbation .",
    "the histogram peaks at growth rates less than the maximum for the mri , @xmath264 . in model z62r , on the other hand , increases are due to the growth of the domain - filling two - channel flow , and decay happens by nearly simultaneous magnetic reconnection throughout .",
    "the mean growth rate @xmath265 is not much less than the mri growth rate .",
    "the distribution of decay rates shows a tail extending to faster values , suggesting reconnection rates may differ from one event to another .",
    "the timescale of magnetic reconnection depends on the alfvn speed .",
    "for example , the timescale of the slow reconnection model ( sweet 1958 ; parker 1957 ; 1963 ) is given by @xmath266 where @xmath184 is the size of a reconnection region and @xmath267 .",
    "if @xmath268 , then decay will be faster when the alfvn speed is faster .",
    "figure  [ fig : omegawm ] shows the growth ( @xmath118 ) and decay rates ( @xmath200 ) for model z62r as a function of the maxwell stress .",
    "time intervals with larger jumps in the stress , @xmath269 , are selected for this figure .",
    "the magnetic energy is proportional to the maxwell stress , so that the horizontal axis also indicates the amplitude of the magnetic energy .",
    "the growth rate is independent of the magnetic stress , while the decay rate increases with magnetic stress and energy .",
    "similar relations occur in the anomalous diffusivity ( z62a ) and ideal mhd models ( z62 ) .",
    "the alfvn speed is @xmath270 , where @xmath271 is the ratio of the maxwell stress to the magnetic pressure ( table 4 ) .",
    "if the field decays due to reconnection at a rate @xmath272 , then @xmath273 for model z62r ( @xmath274 , @xmath275 , and @xmath40 ) .",
    "the relation given by equation ( [ eqn : rec ] ) is shown by a dot - dashed line in the figure .",
    "of course , this interpretation may be too simplified to compare with the simulation results , because the sweet - parker picture is based on a steady structure in the reconnection region . in mri - driven turbulence",
    ", reconnection continues at most a few orbits , because the supply of magnetic flux entering the diffusion region is limited .",
    "reconnection in this situation may be unsteady .",
    "it is evident that magnetic reconnection is a key process in determining the saturation level of the mri turbulence .",
    "magnetic reconnection also makes a major contribution to magnetic energy release in global disk simulations ( machida & matsumoto 2003 ) .",
    "understanding non - steady magnetic reconnection may be important for future progress .",
    "the magnetic energy in the saturated turbulence is determined by a balance between field enhancement by the mri and dissipation through magnetic reconnection .",
    "the linear growth rate of the mri is independent of the gas pressure if the magnetic pressure is much smaller than the gas pressure , as it is in the turbulence .",
    "thus it is quite natural to expect that the gas pressure dependence of the stress may arise from a pressure dependence in the rate of dissipation by magnetic reconnection .",
    "the effects of gas pressure on magnetic reconnection are examined by ugai & kondoh ( 2001 ) , using two - dimensional mhd simulations with an anomalous resistivity .",
    "conditions differ from those we considered in that magnetic pressure exceeds gas pressure .",
    "smaller gas pressures lead to thinner current sheets and more drastic reconnection .",
    "the gas pressure also affects reconnection in laboratory experiments by ji et al .",
    "high gas pressures downstream from the diffusion region substantially reduce the outflow and thus the reconnection rate .",
    "overall , the results of these simulations and experiments are consistent with a picture in which higher gas pressures lead to slower reconnection of magnetic fields .    the _ fluctuation - dissipation relation _ , equation ( [ eqn : edot ] ) , links the rate of change of thermal energy to the stress in the nonlinear regime . if the limiting process in the energy change is reconnection , the left hand side of equation ( [ eqn : edot ] ) is approximately @xmath276 , and the saturated stress is proportional to @xmath277 .",
    "the stress may vary overall with @xmath115 , as in the zero net flux @xmath75 models , if the reconnection timescale is proportional to @xmath278 .",
    "for example , if the size of the reconnection region is proportional to the pressure scale height ( @xmath279 ) , then @xmath280 .",
    "the interpretation discussed here is qualitatively consistent with our numerical results . for further quantitative discussion",
    ", it may be necessary to understand the effects of gas pressure on non - steady magnetic reconnection .",
    "we investigate the saturation level of the mri using three - dimensional mhd simulations . to simplify the problem ,",
    "the local shearing box approximation is adopted and the vertical component of gravity is ignored .",
    "the dependence of the saturation level on the physical quantities is scrutinized , with special attention to effects of gas pressure .",
    "the gas pressure increases with time in adiabatic calculations , and the increase affects the long term evolution of the saturation level .",
    "this feature is carefully taken into account in the analysis of the gas pressure dependence .",
    "the main results are summarized below .    1 .",
    "a power - law relation between the saturation amplitude of the maxwell stress and the gas pressure in the nonlinear regime is derived from all the models performed in this paper .",
    "the power - law index is small ( @xmath203  1/6 ) and varies slightly with the geometry of the magnetic field .",
    "2 .   for the zero net flux models ,",
    "the power - law index is about @xmath123 and the saturation level is independent of the initial gas pressure , the magnetic field strength , and the equation of state .",
    "however , if the mri wavelength is not resolved by at least six grid zones , the saturation level is affected greatly by numerical dissipation .",
    "3 .   for the models with a uniform vertical initial field ,",
    "the power - law index in the pressure - stress relation is smaller than that in the zero net flux models .",
    "the saturation level is higher for larger vertical magnetic fluxes , but there are upper and lower limits on the saturation level depending on the strength of the uniform field .",
    "similar pressure - stress relations are obtained in ideal mhd calculations and resistive mhd models with magnetic reynolds numbers greater than about 10 .",
    "there is no clear difference in saturation level between models with a uniform diffusivity and an anomalous diffusivity .",
    "there exist many characteristic ratios among the quantities in the mri turbulence .",
    "the ratios are independent of initial conditions , including the strength and geometry of the magnetic field , and the gas pressure .",
    "the perturbed magnetic and kinetic energies are maintained near equipartition .",
    "the amplitude of time variability in the maxwell stress is characterized by the ratio of the magnetic pressure to the gas pressure in the nonlinear regime .",
    "the power spectral density of the temporal variability generally has a steep slope around the frequency corresponding to a few orbits .",
    "the gas pressure dependence of the saturation level may originate in the process of magnetic reconnection .",
    "the gain side of the magnetic energy balance is unlikely to depend on gas pressure , since the mri linear growth rate is independent of the pressure when plasma beta exceeds unity .",
    "although there is some qualitative evidence supporting an idea that higher gas pressures reduce reconnection rates , a deeper understanding of magnetic reconnection is necessary for a quantitative discussion of the saturation mechanism of the mri .",
    "the final goal of this work is to derive a predictor function for the saturation level of the mri . for this purpose",
    ", we must determine how the saturation level depends on all the physical quantities .",
    "for example , we have studied the gas pressure dependence using the local shearing box approximation , with the height of the box independent of the gas pressure . in real accretion disks , however , the scale height of the disk varies according to the pressure . before proceeding to derive a saturation predictor and to examine the similarities and differences between the @xmath0 prescription and numerical results , the effects of changes in disk thickness",
    "must be considered .",
    "the effects of the other parameters , and a final form of the predictor function , will be discussed in a subsequent paper .",

    "<S> the saturation level of the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) is investigated using three - dimensional mhd simulations . the shearing box approximation is adopted and the vertical component of gravity is ignored , so that the evolution of the mri is followed in a small local part of the disk . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the dependence of the saturation level of the stress on the gas pressure , which is a key assumption in the standard @xmath0 disk model . from our numerical experiments </S>",
    "<S> it is found that there is a weak power - law relation between the saturation level of the maxwell stress and the gas pressure in the nonlinear regime ; the higher the gas pressure , the larger the stress . </S>",
    "<S> although the power - law index depends slightly on the initial field geometry , the relationship between stress and gas pressure is independent of the initial field strength , and is unaffected by ohmic dissipation if the magnetic reynolds number is at least 10 . </S>",
    "<S> the relationship is the same in adiabatic calculations , where pressure increases over time , and nearly - isothermal calculations , where pressure varies little with time . over the entire region of parameter space </S>",
    "<S> explored , turbulence driven by the mri has many characteristic ratios such as that of the maxwell stress to the magnetic pressure . </S>",
    "<S> we also find the amplitudes of the spatial fluctuations in density and the time variability in the stress are characterized by the ratio of magnetic pressure to gas pressure in the nonlinear regime . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical results are qualitatively consistent with an idea that the saturation level of the mri is determined by a balance between the growth of the mri and the dissipation of the field through reconnection . </S>",
    "<S> the quantitative interpretation of the pressure - stress relation , however , may require advances in the theoretical understanding of non - steady magnetic reconnection . </S>"
