    "explaining the coexistence among selfish individuals is an alluring issue that pervades all disciplines concerned with the emergence and stability of complex structures evolving under the rules of natural selection .",
    "a series of classical quandaries can be traced back to this issue such as the plankton paradox in ecology @xcite , the tragedy of commons in sociology @xcite and the information crisis of prebiotic evolution @xcite , just to name a few .",
    "the many ingenious solutions proposed to tackle those dilemmas , e.g. , nonequilibrium predator - mediated coexistence @xcite , coexistence in flows with chaotic mixing @xcite , kin selection @xcite , reciprocal altruism @xcite , cyclic cooperative interactions @xcite and group selection @xcite , have become major research topics by themselves .    here",
    "we revisit the problem of coexistence of selfish individuals using the group selection framework in the context of prebiotic evolution @xcite .",
    "we recall that , in this context , coexistence is hypothesized to circumvent eigen s paradox of the origin of life @xcite  no large genome without enzymes , and no enzymes without a large genome  by assuming that , initially , each short template coded for a small piece of a modular enzyme ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the ( haploid ) individuals are viewed as self - replicating molecules or templates and the groups as protocells or vesicles that are themselves capable of reproduction .",
    "this is then a prototypical multilevel selection problem @xcite which has been analyzed chiefly through monte carlo simulations and numerical iteration of recursion equations .",
    "the two dynamics that govern the competition between templates and between protocells are coupled because the reproduction rate of the protocells depends on their template composition .",
    "the evolutionary processes we consider here are individual selection and group selection .",
    "in addition , since we assume that the population of templates inside each protocell is large but finite , random genetics drift plays an important role too , especially in the hindering of template coexistence .",
    "the population of protocells , however , is assumed infinite .",
    "we consider two distinct types of templates only and use the so - called diffusion approximation to obtain the partial differential equation that determines the proportion of protocells with a given composition of templates at a given time @xcite .",
    "analysis of the ( singular ) steady - state solution reveals a continuous phase transition separating the coexistence regime , in which a fraction of protocells exhibit a mixed composition of templates , from the segregation regime , in which there is no coexistence of template types inside a protocell .",
    "more pointedly , we show that the order parameter vanishes linearly with the distance to the critical line , and derive an analytical expression for the critical steady - state solution .",
    "the population is divided into an infinite number of protocells each of which carrying exactly @xmath0 templates .",
    "there are two types of templates  type 1 and type 2  which differ only by their replication efficiencies : type 1 has a selective disadvantage @xmath1 relative to type 2 .",
    "we denote by @xmath2 $ ] the frequency of type 1 templates within a protocell ( the frequency of type 2 templates is then @xmath3 ) , and by @xmath4 the probability density of protocells with a fraction @xmath5 of type 1 templates . here",
    "we assume that @xmath0 is sufficiently large so that @xmath5 can be treated as a continuous variable .",
    "hence @xmath6 yields the proportion of protocells carrying type 1 templates with frequency lying in the range @xmath7 .",
    "there is no mutation between the template types and there is no migration of templates between protocells .    within each protocell , template reproduction follows the rules of the standard wright - fisher model @xcite .",
    "in particular , we assume that the individual selection coefficients are @xmath8 and @xmath9 for type 1 and type 2 templates , respectively .",
    "so , if the frequency of type 1 templates within a given protocell is @xmath5 before reproduction , then that frequency becomes @xmath10 after reproduction . we assume , as usual , that @xmath11 is on the order of @xmath12 .",
    "this deterministic process is followed by the random sampling of @xmath0 templates : the probability that the given protocell carries exactly @xmath13 templates of type 1 is given by the binomial @xmath14 so that the frequency of type 1 templates after deterministic selection and random sampling is @xmath15 . the way this procedure changes the probability density @xmath4",
    "is derived using the diffusion approximation of population genetics @xcite , which consists essentially of the calculation of the first two jump moments @xmath16 to obtain the drift ( @xmath17 ) and the diffusion ( @xmath18 ) terms of a fokker - planck equation ( see eq .",
    "[ fp1 ] ) .",
    "the competition between protocells is taken into account as follows . denoting by @xmath19 the selection coefficient of a protocell with a fraction @xmath5 of type 1 templates we have @xmath20 \\zeta\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is such that @xmath22 , i.e , @xmath23 with @xmath24 finally , taking the limit @xmath25 we obtain the change in the fraction of protocells due to intercell selection , @xmath26   \\phi \\left ( x , t   \\right ) \\delta t$ ] .    combining the changes in @xmath27 due to the wright - fisher process and the intercell selection results in the equation @xcite @xmath28 - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x } \\left [ a(x)\\phi \\right ] + \\left [ c(x)-\\bar{c } \\right ] \\phi\\ ] ] where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is given by eq .",

    "equation ( [ fp1 ] ) was first derived by kimura aiming at studying the efficiency of group selection on the evolution and maintenance of an altruistic character @xcite . in our notation ,",
    "the altruists are the type 1 templates , which have a selective disadvantage relative to type 2 or nonaltruistic templates . in the altruism context",
    ", the intercell selection coefficient or group selection pressure must be an increasing function of @xmath5 , so that the higher the frequency of altruists in a group , the greater is the selective advantage of the group .",
    "in particular , kimura has chosen the linear dependence @xmath32 and included the effects of mutation and migration in his analysis @xcite .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the introduction of mutation and migration , which affects only the drift term @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( [ fp1 ] ) , actually greatly simplifies the analysis since these mixing processes guarantee the existence of a regular equilibrium distribution @xcite .",
    "here we consider the coexistence problem instead , which is considerably more taxing to group selection than the altruistic version summarized above .",
    "in fact , despite their handicap at the individual level , the altruistic templates have a nonzero probability of being fixed in small groups solely through the effect of random drift , whereas this very effect is a major pressure against the coexistence between different templates @xcite . to favor coexistence we choose the intercell selection coefficient @xmath34 which is maximum for well - balanced protocells at which @xmath35 .",
    "here @xmath36 is a parameter on the order of @xmath12 which measures the intensity of the group selection pressure towards coexistence . prescription ( [ presc ] )",
    "is built around the so - called metabolic model of template cooperation which assumes that the presence of the two functional template types in the same protocell is needed to assemble a nonspecific replicase which , in turn , plays an essential role in the template replication process @xcite .",
    "since the hookup of the replicase requires products from the two template types , its production rate is proportional to the concentration of the rare type , hence the requirement that @xmath19 is maximized by well - balanced protocells .",
    "in addition , if a protocell lacks any template type it is considered unviable , i.e. , @xmath37 .",
