    "recent aladin collaboration experiments [ 1 ] presented an extensive evidence that the hot projectile prefragments created in the peripheral to semicentral relativistic heavy - ion collisions are thermally equilibrated . temperature _ ( t ) _ and excitation energy _ ( e@xmath0 ) _ are the essential variables specifying their thermodynamic properties .",
    "the dependence of _ t _ on _ e@xmath0 _ ( caloric curve ) revealed a plateau [ 2 ] interpreted as indication of the liquid - gas phase transition in finite nuclear systems .",
    "therefore , a progress in measurement of _",
    "e@xmath0 _ and _ t _ is a necessary prerequisite for the further comprehensive study of the phenomenon .",
    "the predictions of friedman [ 3 ] indicate that an excitation energy of a prefragment , whose mass and charge are generally unknown , can be determined by means of the multiplicities of the emitted neutrons and light charged particles _",
    "( z@xmath1_2_)_. we intend to apply this method to the _ target spectators _ by employing a large - volume gd - loaded liquid scintillation detector ( a neutron multiplicity meter - nmm ) to count neutrons originating from their decay . a study of feasibility and limitations of the friedman s method in the aladin environment asked for a program giving a more comprehensive description of the neutron detection process in a nmm than offered by denis [ 4 ] , presently used in several laboratories [ 5 ] .",
    "these considerations prompted us to develop msx , a monte - carlo code containing several improvements in comparison with its predecessor .",
    "the detection process in a nmm [ 5 ] consists of the following stages : + _ i ) _ neutron slowing down due to the multiple scattering on the hydrogen and carbon nuclei of the scintillator .",

    "part of the electron s energy loss , determined by the scintillation efficiency , is converted into visible light .",
    "+ _ v ) _ transport of light to the photocathodes of photomultipliers ( pms ) through multiple reflections on the diffusely reflecting coating of the interior of the tank .",
    "the above stage _ ( i ) _ involves two vastly different time scales .",
    "the dissipation of neutron s total initial kinetic energy occurs within a nanosecond time scale , giving the initial prompt part of the scintillation signal .",
    "the signal coming from the @xmath3-rays follows with a random delay of up to 50  @xmath6s , the time scale determined by the probability of capture , terminating the diffusion process . therefore essential for the operation of a nmm",
