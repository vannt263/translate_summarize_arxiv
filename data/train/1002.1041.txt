    "diophantine equations of the form @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a nonzero integer and @xmath11 is an odd prime , have been studied by several authors . when @xmath12 , the case @xmath13 was solved by rabinowitz in @xcite , while le dealt with the case @xmath0 in @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath14 was considered by abu muriefah in @xcite .",
    "cao @xcite treated the cases @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for closely related results ) .",
    "we should moreover mention that the equation has no solution in positive integers @xmath4 when @xmath17 , as can be inferred from the work of nagell @xcite and cao @xcite .",
    "the case when @xmath18 , where @xmath2 is an odd prime , was studied in the recent paper @xcite of abu muriefah .",
    "let us first note that , for fixed @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the diophantine equation @xmath21 and , more generally , the diophantine equation @xmath22 , have at most finitely many solutions @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively . indeed , in this case , @xmath25 and the claim follows from theorem 2 of @xcite .",
    "a main result in the aforementioned paper @xcite , namely , theorem 3.1 , states that the equation @xmath26 , has two families of solutions given by @xmath27 ( or @xmath28 ,  @xmath29 , where @xmath30 ( respectively @xmath31 ) is the @xmath32th term of the fibonacci sequence ( respectively the lucas sequence ) .",
    "however , straightforward computations show that the only fibonacci or lucas number @xmath33 satisfying the title equation when @xmath7 is @xmath34 with @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and , further , in @xmath38 , @xmath39 is prime and @xmath40 is neither a fibonacci nor a lucas number . the same theorem 3.1 of @xcite states that , if @xmath0 is a prime @xmath41 and @xmath2 is another odd prime , then there are no integer solutions @xmath42 to the equation @xmath21 with @xmath43 .",
    "the proof of theorem 3.1 in @xcite , just before its end , contains an obvious , non - rectifiable error , at case 2 , when @xmath44 is set equal to @xmath45 although @xmath46 with @xmath47 . that the said proof is erroneous is also pointed out by p.g .",
    "walsh in his review @xcite of @xcite .",
    "one of our aims in the present paper is to prove abu muriefah s assertion when @xmath5 ; see theorem [ th p equiv 3 mod 8 ] .",
    "our proof , rather than rectifying abu muriefah s argument ( this is probably impossible ) , goes through totally different lines .",
    "unfortunately , our arguments can not be extended to the case @xmath48 .",
    "as we revisited the title equation , we further discovered some new results , like theorems [ th on main eq ] , [ th gen exp eq ] and [ th with y = q ] which , we believe , merit one s attention .",
    "moreover , since the powerful techniques of sections [ section exp eq with y prime ] and [ section general exp eq ] are also applicable ( after the appropriate modifications ) to diophantine equations other than the ones treated in this paper , we thought it useful to expose them in some detail , enough for the reader to profit from them .",
    "as we stated above , one of the main results of this paper is the following    [ th on main eq ] let @xmath2 be an odd prime .",
    "if either @xmath49 or @xmath50 , then there is no integer solution @xmath42 to the equation @xmath51 otherwise , there exists at most one integer solution @xmath42 and if it actually exists , then it must satisfy the following conditions : + ( i ) @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",

    "remark_. if the prime @xmath2 is of the form @xmath58 ( the first few primes of this shape are 1801 , 160201 , 1245001 , 4792201 , 8179201 ) , then @xmath59 is a solution to ( [ eq initial ] ) and , according to the theorem , this is the only one ( with @xmath60 ) .",
    "we have not been able , however , to find a prime @xmath2 such that the corresponding equation ( [ eq initial ] ) has a solution with @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , we state the following    if the prime @xmath2 is not of the form @xmath58 , then the equation ( [ eq initial ] ) has no solutions .",
    "the proof of theorem [ th on main eq ] follows from a straightforward combination of corollary [ proposition on main eq ] and theorem [ th with y = q ] , a second main result of our paper . in turn , the proof of theorem [ th with y = q ] relies on a third main result , namely , theorem [ th gen exp eq ] concerning the equation @xmath8 which is interesting for its own sake .",
    "indeed , in recent years , important papers are devoted to equations of the form @xmath62 .",
    "one main strategy for attacking such equations is based on the so called _ modular method _ which has been successfully applied in quite a number of cases ; see chapter 15 ( by s.  siksek ) in h.  cohen s book @xcite , the survey article @xcite and @xcite and the references therein . for our equation @xmath8",
    ", the existence of the trivial solution @xmath63 makes the modular approach unsuccessful and prevents us from giving the complete solution @xmath42 .",
    "thus , our theorem [ th gen exp eq ] offers only a partial result which , at present , seems to be best possible .",
    "the main results of this section are proposition [ proposition general muriefah ] and theorem [ th p equiv 3 mod 8 ]    [ proposition general muriefah ] let @xmath0 be a prime number @xmath1 and let @xmath2 be an odd prime number .",
    "if @xmath3 are positive integers with @xmath4 relatively prime such that @xmath64 then there exists a rational integer @xmath65 such that @xmath66 and @xmath67    the condition @xmath43 implies @xmath68 and the condition @xmath69 implies that @xmath70 is odd .",
    "we work in the imaginary quadratic field @xmath71 , where @xmath72 . equation ( [ eq 3.1 ] )",
    "factorizes as @xmath73 and , trivially , the factors in the left - hand side are relatively prime .",
    "this implies an ideal equation @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is an integral ideal of @xmath76 .",
    "since the ideal - class number of @xmath76 is strictly less than @xmath11 ( see page 199 of @xcite ) , the above ideal equation implies that @xmath75 is a principal ideal , therefore we obtain the equation @xmath77 for some rational integers @xmath65 and @xmath78 . in case",
    "@xmath5 we write the above equation as @xmath79 , implying @xmath80 . from this , we see that @xmath65 can not be odd . for , otherwise , we would have @xmath81 or @xmath82 .",
    "but we easily check that , for @xmath83 , it is true that @xmath84 , a contradiction .",
    "therefore , @xmath65 in ( [ xomega+q^n ] ) is even and ( [ xomega+q^n ] ) is equivalent to the simpler equation @xmath85 for some rational integers @xmath65 and @xmath78 of opposite parity since @xmath86 is odd . also , it is easy to see that @xmath87 .",
    "if we put @xmath88 then @xmath89 and the fact that @xmath90 is an algebraic integer implies that @xmath78 divides @xmath91 ( in @xmath92 ) , hence @xmath46 for some @xmath93 .    at this point",
    "we note that the pair @xmath94 is a lehmer pair for which @xmath95 concerning @xmath96 appearing in the relation @xmath46 ( see a few lines above ) , we distinguish two cases .",
    "+ ( i ) @xmath97 .",
    "then , in the terminology of @xcite , @xmath94 is a @xmath11-defective pair . by theorems 1.4 and c of @xcite",
    "it easily follows that @xmath7 is the only possibility .",
    "then , by theorem 1.3 of @xcite , either @xmath98 for some @xmath99 , or @xmath100 for some @xmath101 , where @xmath102 , @xmath103 denotes the fibonacci sequence and @xmath104 is defined by @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 for @xmath108 .",
    "it is easily checked that , for every @xmath109 , @xmath110 ; therefore the second alternative must be excluded . on the other hand , by thorme 1.3 of @xcite ,",
    "a relation of the form @xmath111 with @xmath112 and @xmath113 is impossible , which excludes the first alternative as well .",
    "+ ( ii ) @xmath114 , so that @xmath115",

    "obviously , the minus sign in the first equation is rejected and @xmath65 is @xmath65 is even .",

    "then , @xmath626 so that @xmath627 and @xmath628 are meaningful . by properties [ prop 2 ] and [ prop 3 ] of the polynomials @xmath598 and @xmath629 we have @xmath630 hence @xmath631 by property [ prop 1 ] and the fact that @xmath632 for any negative real number @xmath305 , @xmath633 and similarly , @xmath634 then , ( [ inequality with g , h ] ) implies @xmath635 , from which @xmath636 now , let us put @xmath637 , so that , from the above inequality we have @xmath638 let @xmath639 .",
    "then , @xmath640 now comes the moment to choose @xmath611 .",
    "first we choose @xmath641 to satisfy @xmath642 we must keep in mind that there are exactly two consecutive positive integers in the interval @xmath643 $ ] ; this is a simple exercise .",
    "choose now @xmath604 by setting @xmath644 and remember that @xmath645 .",
    "moreover , we will need below that the left - hand side of ( [ estimate difference ] ) be non - zero .",
    "in the next lines we show that we can choose @xmath641 in such a way that this requirement be satisfied .",
    "suppose that for the smaller integer @xmath641 in the interval @xmath646 $ ] the left - hand side of ( [ estimate difference ] ) is zero .",
    "then , we can repeat the above process with @xmath647 in place of @xmath641 ( @xmath648 still belongs to this interval ) , @xmath649 in place of @xmath604 and @xmath650 in place of @xmath460 , so that the polynomials @xmath598 and @xmath629 will be replaced by @xmath651 and @xmath652 respectively , and the integers @xmath653 by some other integers , say , @xmath654 .",
    "then , we will obtain an inequality analogous to ( [ estimate difference ] ) , namely , @xmath655 if the left - hand side were again zero , then we would have @xmath656 ( note that @xmath657 ) , which would easily imply that @xmath658 is a zero of the function @xmath659 and this contradicts property [ prop 4 ] of the polynomials @xmath660 .",
    "we conclude therefore that for at least one integer @xmath641 satisfying ( [ choose n1 ] ) , the left - hand side of ( [ estimate difference ] ) is non - zero and from now on we assume that we have selected such an @xmath641 .",
    "we now rewrite the term @xmath661 appearing in the left - hand side of ( [ estimate difference ] ) .",
    "we first observe that ( [ define la ] ) implies @xmath662 which shows that @xmath663 for some non - negative integer @xmath664 .",
    "consequently , on putting @xmath665 ( a positive integer ) , we have @xmath666 going back to ( [ estimate difference ] ) , we get @xmath667 from which @xmath668 we estimate separately the second summand in the left - hand side of ( [ sum larger than 1 ] ) . by the hypothesis on the lower bound of @xmath669 and ( [ define la ] ) we have @xmath670 which shows that the second summand in the left - hand side of ( [ sum larger than 1 ] ) is @xmath671 .",
    "this shows that the first summand in the left - hand side of ( [ sum larger than 1 ] ) is larger than @xmath672 .",
    "then , remembering also how @xmath673 has been defined and using property [ prop 5 ] of the polynomial @xmath598 , we get @xmath674 from which we immediately get @xmath675 ( the right - most inequality being true because @xmath676 in view of ( [ define la ] ) ) , and hence the claimed lower bound for @xmath677 .",
    "this completes the proof of lemma [ technical lemma ] .",
    "+ _ step 3 : completion of the proof of theorem [ at most one solution]_. assume that , if @xmath516 is not a perfect square there exists a solution to equation ( [ eq 5x^2=q^n+4 ] ) and if @xmath516 is a perfect square there exists a solution to this equation besides the obvious one which results from the relation @xmath678 .",
    "thus , in both cases , our assumptions in particular imply that there exists a solution @xmath679 with @xmath680 , hence , by theorem [ th gen exp eq ] , we must have @xmath681 .",
    "let @xmath504 be the least solution to equation ( [ eq 5x^2=q^n+4 ] ) .",
    "in order to prove the theorem , we will assume that a larger solution @xmath682 to ( [ eq 5x^2=q^n+4 ] ) exists and we will arrive at a contradiction .",
    "+ we put @xmath621 , so that @xmath683 , from which we get @xmath684 therefore @xmath685 we apply lemma [ technical lemma ] with @xmath686 , @xmath687 ; then it is easy to check that @xmath688 and by the conclusion of the lemma and the last displayed inequality we get @xmath689 hence @xmath690 from which @xmath691 on the other hand , recalling that @xmath692 and @xmath693 , we have in view of ( [ lower bound n ] ) , @xmath694 combining this lower bound for @xmath521 with ( [ upper bound n ] ) , we get the following relation : @xmath695 by the definition of @xmath619 , @xmath696 . solving for @xmath619 and substituting into the above inequality",
    "we obtain @xmath697 however , in view of the large size of @xmath2 we easily check that ( [ impossible ineq ] ) is _ not _ satisfied and this contradiction proves that the solution @xmath519 can not exist .",
