    "( [ eq : hij ] ) contains second - order radial derivatives of @xmath87 , one needs to calculate fourth - order radial derivatives of @xmath187 and @xmath188 , which are solutions of scalar - like poisson equations with matter terms on the rhs . in the case of neutron stars , it is quite often that radial density profiles have a discontinuous derivative at the surface of the star . therefore , @xmath187 and @xmath188 admit discontinuous third - order radial derivatives and their fourth - order derivatives can not be represented at all by means of spectral methods .",
    "a solution could be to use adaptive mapping : the boundary between two spectral domains coincides with the ( non - spherical ) surface of the star ( see @xcite ) . still , the evaluation of a fourth - order radial derivative introduces too much numerical noise , even using spectral methods .",
    "we have therefore chosen to use a different approach , detailed hereafter .    instead of using directly all the spherical components of the tensor @xmath87 , we use only the @xmath189- component , the trace @xmath190 and the four potentials @xmath191 , @xmath188 , @xmath128 and @xmath192 defined as follow , in the orthonormal basis @xmath193 : @xmath194 and @xmath195 with @xmath196 .",
    "these equations can be inverted to compute the potentials in terms of the angular part of the laplace operator @xmath197 giving @xmath198    these quantities @xmath199 are interesting for , at least , two reasons : first they can be expanded onto a basis of scalar spherical harmonics @xmath200 , which are often used in the framework of spectral methods , for they are eigenfunctions of the angular laplace operator ( [ eq : lapang ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the three gauge conditions ( [ eq : dirach ] ) can be reformulated in terms of these potentials : @xmath201 when decomposing the fields on a basis of spherical harmonics , these relations reduce to a system of ordinary differential equations with respect to @xmath202 , which is solved by spectral methods in a similar way to the poisson equation @xcite .      1 .",
    "transform the source term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hij ] ) to the cartesian basis , 2 .",
    "solve the resulting six decoupled scalar poisson equations for @xmath87 , 3 .",
    "transform @xmath87 back to the spherical basis and compute the potentials @xmath128 and @xmath192 , 4 .",
    "do an iteration on @xmath203 , first solving the system  ( [ e : dir1])-([e : dir3 ] ) with @xmath204 and @xmath192 as sources and then calculating the new value of @xmath203 from the non - linear equation  ( [ eq : detgam1 ] ) .",
    "since the system is overdetermined ( four additional relations to satisfy ) , the integrability condition is that the source of the tensor poisson equation  ( [ eq : hij ] ) be divergence - free .",
    "we do not impose this condition during the main iteration of the code , since this is not true for intermediate solutions of the metric and matter fields .",
    "we only check that this is satisfied , up to the accuracy of the code , at the end of the iteration , and we have found that this was true at the error level given by the virial identities ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : global ] ) . the potentials @xmath128 and @xmath192 have been chosen among the six degrees of freedom of @xmath87 because none of their radial derivatives appear in the gauge conditions  ( [ e : dir1])-([e : dir3 ] ) ,",
    "hence , we do not calculate any radial derivative of these quantities to get the other components of @xmath87 .",
    "another reason for this choice is that , when considering a more general case of dynamically evolving spacetime , these two potentials are asymptotically related to the two gravitational wave polarisation modes : @xmath205 and @xmath206 in our asymptotically transverse - traceless gauge ) implies that @xmath207 to the linear order ] .",
    "note that in our case of stationary and axisymmetric spacetime , we have @xmath208 , which simplifies the resolution ."
