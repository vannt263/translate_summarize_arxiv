    "well before the data from the high redshift supernova project became available , several independent constraints indicated the existence of a cosmological constant @xcite . in the last decade , observational evidence for an accelerating universe has become conclusive with almost all other possibilities being ruled out by observations of high redshift supernovae @xcite and the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) @xcite .",
    "the accelerated expansion of the universe requires either a cosmological constant or some form of dark energy @xcite to drive the acceleration , with @xmath2 .",
    "although a cosmological constant is the simplest solution from a phenomenological point of view ( requiring just one fine tuned parameter ) , there is no natural explanation of the small observed value .",
    "this has led theorists to develop models in which a field , typically a scalar field , provides the source of dark energy , e.g. , quintessence @xcite , k - essence @xcite , tachyons @xcite , phantom fields @xcite , branes @xcite , etc . in the absence of significant _ spatial _ variation in the dark energy ,",
    "the key difference between such models and the one with the cosmological constant is that , in general , @xmath3 is a function of redshift @xmath4 in the former .",
    "perturbations in dark energy also lead to observable signatures , though these can easily be confused with other physical effects @xcite .",
    "there have also been a few proposals for unified dark matter and dark energy @xcite but these models are yet to be developed in sufficient detail to allow direct comparison with observations in a fruitful manner .",
    "if the current observations had excluded @xmath5 then one could have immediately ruled out cosmological constant as a candidate ; but since this is not the case , direct exploration of @xmath6 at different redshifts , in order to check possible dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath4 , is of importance .",
    "observations constrain the entire suite of parameters that describe cosmological parameters and while it is possible to choose other cosmological parameters so that @xmath7cdm is not allowed , these models have not been ruled out so far .",
    "it has been known for some time that supernova observations and constraints from structure formation can be combined to put stringent limits on models for dark energy @xcite .",
    "several attempts have been made in the past to constrain the equation of state for dark energy , along with other cosmological parameters , using the observations of galaxy clustering , temperature anisotropies in the cmbr and the high redshift supernovae @xcite .",
    "this work , which is in the same spirit , focuses exclusively on constraining the variation of equation of state for dark energy by using a combination of such observations .",
    "we wish to constrain the variation of dark energy while keeping most of the other cosmological parameters fixed around their favoured values .",
    "in particular , we study the effect of a varying equation of state on the angular power spectrum of the cmbr fluctuations .",
    "dark energy is not expected to be dynamically significant at the time of decoupling and  in fact  models in which this is not true are plagued by slow growth of density perturbations @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , evolving dark energy will affect the features of temperature anisotropies in the cmbr in at least two ways : ( 1 )  the angular scale of features in temperature anisotropy , like the peaks , will change since the angular diameter distance depends on the form of @xmath6 .",
    "( 2 )  the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect will also depend on the nature of dark energy and its evolution , this effect is more relevant at small @xmath8 .",
    "thus observations of temperature anisotropies in the cmbr can be used to constrain the _ evolution _ of dark energy . combined with the supernova observations ,",
    "this allows us to put tight constraints on the equation of state of dark energy and its evolution .",
    "our approach here is to use the full wmap angular power spectrum in order to ensure that both the effects mentioned above are captured in the analysis",
    ". for lower multipoles ( @xmath9 ) signals from the isw effect , perturbations in dark energy and reionisation need to be disentangled , however the relative importance of this part of the angular power spectrum is limited as we use the full angular power spectrum from wmap .",
    "our aim is to demonstrate that the combination of wmap observations and high redshift supernova observations is a very powerful constraint on variations in dark energy , certainly more powerful that either of the observations used in isolation .",
    "_ as far as we know , most previous attempts to constrain the dark energy sector using wmap data have not used the full angular power spectrum . _",
    "supernova observations , as well as the angular power spectrum of temperature anisotropies in the microwave background put geometric constraints on dark energy . thus these observations constrain the hubble parameter @xmath10 , which for the models under consideration here can be written as : @xmath11 \\nonumber\\ ] ] where we have ignored the contribution of radiation to energy density . observed fluxes from supernovae and location of peaks in the cmb constrain distances to supernovae and to the surface of last scattering @xcite , respectively .",
    "dark energy can be constrained only at redshifts where it contributes significantly to the energy density , therefore observations are sensitive to changes in @xmath12 at low redshifts and variations at high redshifts ( @xmath13 ) will be difficult to detect .",
    "variation in @xmath12 can be written in terms of changes in the equation of state parameter @xmath3 . once we allow for variation of @xmath3 , one is dealing with a _ function _ which , technically , has an infinite number of parameters .",
    "given a finite number of observations , one can always fine tune such a function . from a practical point of view",
    ", it is necessary ( and often sufficient ) to represent @xmath6 using a small number of parameters and do the analysis .",
    "the results will necessarily have some amount of parameterization dependence @xcite but this can be controlled by choosing different forms of parameterization and determining the range of variations in the results . in this work , we shall use the two parameterizations : @xmath14 for both @xmath15 we have @xmath16 but the high redshift behaviour of these functions are different : @xmath17 for @xmath18 while @xmath19 for @xmath20 .",
    "hence @xmath20 can model a dark energy component which has the same equation of state at the present epoch and at high redshifts , with rapid variation at low @xmath4 .",
    "observations are not very sensitive to variations in w(z ) for @xmath13 , hence return to the present value is not of critical importance",
    ". however , it does allow us to probe rapid variations at small redshifts .",
    "for @xmath18 , we can trust the results only if @xmath21 is well below zero at the time of decoupling so that dark energy is not relevant for the physics of recombination of the evolution of perturbations up to that epoch . as we shall see , the allowed range of parameters does not contain such models .",
    "this constraint on the asymptotic value means that this parameterisation can not be used to probe rapid variations at small redshifts .",
    "we will take @xmath22 @xcite where density parameter for the total non - relativistic component is denoted by @xmath23 and the density parameter for dark energy is @xmath24 .",
    "we will make assumptions regarding a few other parameters as well : ( i ) we assume that @xmath25 and ( ii ) @xmath26 .",
    "( iii ) we also assume that the density fluctuations have the harrison - zeldovich spectrum , i.e. , @xmath27 .",
    "we do this since ( a ) there have been numerous studies in the past , restricting the standard cosmological parameters and ( b ) we wish to focus on the effect of @xmath28 .",
    "one can quarrel with these assumptions but these are sufficient to give us an idea of the parameter space available for variation of dark energy .",
    "a complete study of these issues will need to address two questions : what is the parameter space available for variation of dark energy if all parameters of interest in cosmological models are allowed to vary , this essentially addresses the issue of potential degeneracies of variation of dark energy with other parameters , and , if dark energy is allowed to vary then does that increase or change the allowed range of other parameters ?",
    "we are carrying out a detailed study to address these issues @xcite .",
    "we will comment on dependence of our results on some of these parameters whenever relevant .    for the supernova analysis , which is by now standard @xcite , we combine the data on @xmath29 supernovae published by tonry et al . and also for the @xmath30 supernovae listed by barris et al .",
    "@xcite . to account for the uncertainty in measurement of cosmological redshift",
    ", we neglect the data points at redshift @xmath31 .",
    "the points with @xmath32 are neglected because of the uncertainty in host galaxy extinction , after these cuts we are left with data for @xmath33 supernovae .",
    "we compare the distance modulus predicted by theoretical models to the observed variation of apparent magnitudes of high redshift supernovae .",
    "we use the @xmath34 minimization method to find the best fit model . the supernova data favours dark energy to have an equation of state @xmath35 at the present epoch , with the lower values favoured for larger @xmath23 .",
    "significant variation in energy density of dark energy is allowed by supernova observations ( see figure  [ fig : wenvelope ] ) , e.g. the energy density can change by more than a factor of @xmath36 by @xmath37 .",
    "the results we obtain are consistent with similar analysis in other papers @xcite .",
    "use of supernovae sorted on the basis of data quality @xcite gives similar , though somewhat tighter constraints .",
    "let us now add constraints from the wmap observations .",
    "the location of peaks in the angular power spectrum of temperature anisotropies ( which depends on the angular diameter distance , which  in turn  depends on @xmath6 ) provides the main constraint .",
    "other effects like isw provide a further constraint but their impact is limited as these are restricted to @xmath9 for most models whereas we use the full wmap angular power spectrum ( @xmath38 ) . given that the physics of recombination and evolution of perturbations does not change if we only modify @xmath6 within some safe limits , any change in the observed angular power spectrum will be due to a change in @xmath6 .",
    "the location of peaks in the angular power spectrum of temperature anisotropies will provide the main constraint and hence fix the effective value of @xmath6 .",
    "we can define a @xmath39 by requiring that the angular size of a critical scale like the hubble radius at the time of decoupling is same in the model with a given @xmath6 and for the model where @xmath40  constant .",
    "observations mainly constrain the value of @xmath39 .",
    "thus if the present value @xmath41 then we should have @xmath42 , and similarly if @xmath43 then @xmath44 in the parameterisations we have used . of course , if @xmath45 then @xmath46 .",
    "the priors we have considered here is @xmath47 km  s@xmath48  mpc@xmath48 , @xmath27 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "we do not vary many of these parameters as our main aim is to study the allowed variation in dark energy .",
    "if we allow variation of all parameters at once , it will become difficult to understand the impact of individual variations .",
    "( we have varied some of the parameters individually , e.g. , we have checked that allowing for reionisation with a prior @xmath54 does not make a significant difference to the results , even though the best fit value of optical depth @xmath55 is different for different models . )",
    "we are carrying out a detailed study where variation of most of these parameters is allowed and we also bring in more constraints @xcite .",
    "we do not take into account perturbations in dark energy in this paper .",
    "perturbations in dark energy can modify our results to some extent .",
    "the effect of perturbtations depends on the detailed model of dark energy and can not be incorporated in the model independent aprroach we have used here . including adiabatic perturbations in dark energy",
    "does not change our result significantly as the effect of these perturbations changes the angular power spectrum only for @xmath9 .",
    "the effect of perturbations in dark energy becomes more relevant if we consider the allowed values of all cosmological parameters in a varying dark energy model .    to bring in these constraints from wmap data , we need to compare the angular power spectrum expected in a given model with the observed spectrum @xcite .",
