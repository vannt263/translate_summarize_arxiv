    "since the discovery of the @xmath0 meson in 1974 , charmonium has provided a useful laboratory for quantitative tests of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and , in particular , of the interplay of perturbative and nonperturbative phenomena .",
    "the factorization formalism of nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite provides a rigorous theoretical framework for the description of heavy - quarkonium production and decay .",
    "this formalism implies a separation of short - distance coefficients , which can be calculated perturbatively as expansions in the strong - coupling constant @xmath5 , from long - distance matrix elements ( mes ) , which must be extracted from experiment .",
    "the relative importance of the latter can be estimated by means of velocity scaling rules ; _ i.e. _ , the mes are predicted to scale with a definite power of the heavy - quark ( @xmath6 ) velocity @xmath7 in the limit @xmath8 . in this way",
    ", the theoretical predictions are organized as double expansions in @xmath5 and @xmath7 .",
    "a crucial feature of this formalism is that it takes into account the complete structure of the @xmath9 fock space , which is spanned by the states @xmath10 with definite spin @xmath11 , orbital angular momentum @xmath12 , total angular momentum @xmath13 , and color multiplicity @xmath14 .",
    "in particular , this formalism predicts the existence of color - octet ( co ) processes in nature .",
    "this means that @xmath9 pairs are produced at short distances in co states and subsequently evolve into physical , color - singlet ( cs ) quarkonia by the nonperturbative emission of soft gluons . in the limit @xmath15 , the traditional cs model ( csm",
    ") @xcite is recovered .",
    "the greatest triumph of this formalism was that it was able to correctly describe @xcite the cross section of inclusive charmonium hadroproduction measured in @xmath16 collisions at the fermilab tevatron @xcite , which had turned out to be more than one order of magnitude in excess of the theoretical prediction based on the csm .",
    "apart from this phenomenological drawback , the csm also suffers from severe conceptual problems indicating that it is incomplete .",
    "these include the presence of logarithmic infrared ( ir ) singularities in the @xmath17 corrections to @xmath18-wave decays to light hadrons and in the relativistic corrections to @xmath11-wave annihilation @xcite , and the lack of a general argument for its validity in higher orders of perturbation theory .    in order to convincingly establish the phenomenological significance of the co processes , it is indispensable to identify them in other kinds of high - energy experiments as well .",
    "studies of charmonium production in @xmath19 photoproduction , @xmath19 and @xmath20 deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) , @xmath4 annihilation in the continuum , @xmath21-boson decays , @xmath1 collisions , and @xmath22-hadron decays may be found in the literature ; for reviews , see ref .",
    "furthermore , the polarization of @xmath3 mesons produced directly and of @xmath0 mesons produced promptly , _",
    "i.e. _ , either directly or via the feed - down from heavier charmonia , which also provides a sensitive probe of co processes , was investigated . until recently , none of these studies was able to prove or disprove the nrqcd factorization hypothesis .",
    "however , h1 data of @xmath23 in dis at the desy hadron electron ring accelerator ( hera ) @xcite and delphi data of @xmath24 at the cern large electron positron collider ( lep2 ) @xcite provide first independent evidence for it by agreeing with the respective nrqcd predictions @xcite .",
    "the verification of the nrqcd factorization hypothesis is presently hampered both from the theoretical and experimental sides . on the one hand , the theoretical predictions to be compared with existing experimental data are , apart from very few exceptions @xcite , of lowest order ( lo ) and thus suffer from considerable uncertainties , mostly from the dependences on the renormalization and factorization scales and from the lack of information on the nonperturbative mes . on the other hand ,",
    "the experimental errors are still rather sizeable .",
    "the latter will be dramatically reduced with the upgrades of hera ( hera ii ) and the tevatron ( run ii ) and with the advent of cern lhc and hopefully a future @xmath4 linear collider ( lc ) such as the tev - energy superconducting linear accelerator ( tesla ) , which is presently being designed and planned at desy and has just been endorsed by the international committee for future accelerators ( icfa ) . on the theoretical side ,",
    "it is necessary to calculate the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) corrections to the hard - scattering cross sections and to include the effective operators which are suppressed by higher powers in @xmath7 .    in this paper , we concentrate on the inclusive production of @xmath0 mesons in high - energy @xmath1 collisions .",
    "as mentioned above , this process was studied at lep2 @xcite , where the photons originated from hard initial - state bremsstrahlung . at high - energy @xmath4 lcs",
    ", an additional source of hard photons is provided by beamstrahlung , the synchrotron radiation emitted by one of the colliding bunches in the field of the opposite bunch .",
    "the highest possible photon energies with large enough luminosity may be achieved by converting the @xmath4 lc into a @xmath1 collider via back - scattering of high - energetic laser light off the electron and positron beams .    in order for a @xmath0 meson to acquire finite transverse momentum ( @xmath25 )",
    ", it must be produced together with another particle or a hadron jet ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "recently , we studied the process @xmath27 , where @xmath28 denotes the hadronic remnant possibly including a second jet , at nlo @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we perform a similar analysis for the process @xmath29 , where @xmath30 represents a prompt photon .",
    "this process leads to a spectacular signal . on the one hand",
    ", @xmath0 mesons can be easily identified through their decays to @xmath4 or @xmath31 pairs , with a combined branching fraction of @xmath32 . on the other hand ,",
    "isolated energetic photons can be detected with high efficiency through the distinctive showers they produce in the electromagnetic calorimeter , which can be distinguished from those due to @xmath33 mesons on a statistical basis , or through their conversion to @xmath4 pairs .",
    "the incoming photons can interact either directly with the quarks participating in the hard - scattering process ( direct photoproduction ) or via their quark and gluon content ( resolved photoproduction ) .",
    "thus , the process @xmath29 receives contributions from the direct , single - resolved , and double - resolved channels .",
    "all three contributions are formally of the same order in the perturbative expansion .",
    "this may be understood by observing that the parton density functions ( pdfs ) of the photon have a leading behavior proportional to @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the fine - structure constant , @xmath36 is the factorization scale , and @xmath37 is the asymptotic scale parameter of qcd .    in the following ,",
    "we focus our attention on the direct channel , for which there is a phenomenological and a theoretical argument .",
    "the former is exposed already at lo .",
    "in fact , @xmath29 almost exclusively proceeds through direct photoproduction because it is then a cs process @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the single - resolved contribution is strongly suppressed , by the ratio @xmath38\\right\\rangle/",
    "\\left\\langle{\\cal o}^{j/\\psi}\\left[{}^3\\!s_1^{(1)}\\right]\\right\\rangle\\propto v^4 $ ] .",
    "there is also a cs process in the double - resolved channel .",
    "however , it is mediated at the parton level via gluon fusion and thus suppressed by the smallness of the gluon pdf of the photon .",
    "the theoretical argument is related to the observation that @xmath29 via direct photoproduction does not yet require mass factorization at nlo .",
    "therefore , this contribution does not suffer from an artificial @xmath36 dependence , so that it is justified to consider it separately . by the same token",
    ", the @xmath36 dependence of the single - resolved contribution at lo is relatively feeble and to be compensated by the direct contribution at next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) , which is beyond the scope of our analysis .",
    "the nlo treatments of the single - resolved and double - resolved channels are left for future work .    in the parton model , prompt photons can also be produced through the fragmentation of quarks and gluons , which necessitates the introduction of photon fragmentation functions . from arguments similar to those regarding",
    "the photon pdfs mentioned above , it follows that also the photon fragmentation functions are formally of order @xmath39 .",
    "thus , consistency requires that their contribution be taken into account in the theoretical description of prompt - photon inclusive production .",
    "however , if the prompt - photon momentum is integrated over , then the enhancement factor @xmath40 disappears , so that , in direct photoproduction , photon fragmentation is degraded to a nnlo contribution .",
    "strictly speaking , we consider the process @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is a hadronic system containing a prompt photon , rather than the process @xmath29 .    in order to distinguish prompt photons from bremsstrahlung photons ,",
    "some hardness condition must be introduced , _",
    "e.g. _ , by requiring that the transverse momentum of the photon be in excess of some minimum value . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", this is essential because soft - photon bremsstrahlung generates an ir catastrophe , which must be removed by including also the corresponding virtual - photon contribution .",
    "however , this would then be equivalent to calculating the @xmath43 correction to the process @xmath44 , which is suppressed against the @xmath17 one already provided in ref .",
    "@xcite , and this is not our intention here .    the @xmath0 mesons can be produced directly ; or via radiative or hadronic decays of heavier charmonia , such as @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons ; or via weak decays of @xmath22 hadrons .",
    "the respective decay branching fractions are @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath22 hadrons can be detected by looking for displaced decay vertices with dedicated vertex detectors , and the @xmath0 mesons originating from their decays can thus be treated separately . therefore and because of the smallness of @xmath50 , @xmath0 production through @xmath22-hadron decay is not considered here .",
    "the cross sections of the four residual indirect production channels may be approximated by multiplying the direct - production cross sections of the respective intermediate charmonia with their decay branching fractions to @xmath0 mesons .",
    "to summarize , the goal of the present analysis is to calculate the inclusive cross section of @xmath41 in direct photoproduction for finite values of @xmath25 at nlo within nrqcd allowing for the @xmath0 meson to be promptly produced .",
    "the lo result , also including the single- and double - resolved contributions , may be found in refs .",
    "@xcite and the related references cited therein .",
    "the leading relativistic correction , which originates from the @xmath51 fock state @xmath52 and is of @xmath53 relative to the lo result , may be extracted from ref .",
    "apart from being of general phenomenological relevance , the analyses reported here and in ref .",
    "@xcite should also be of conceptual interest for the theoretical heavy - quarkonium community because this is the first time that the full nlo corrections are evaluated for inclusive @xmath54 processes bound state is considered as one particle . ] within the nrqcd framework .",
    "several theoretical problems that need to be tackled in our present analysis were encountered in similar form in ref .",
    "@xcite and do not need to be explained again in detail .",
    "however , there are also qualitatively new features , especially in connection with the operator renormalization and the cancellation of ir singularities , which need to be discussed carefully .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : ana ]",
    ", we describe our analytical calculation in some detail , focussing on the qualitatively new features . in section  [ sec : num ] , we present our numerical results appropriate for the @xmath4 mode of tesla , and discuss their phenomenological implications .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section  [ sec : con ] .",

    "the @xmath70 dependence cancels between @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "while @xmath71 is known in analytic form , the phase - space integrals occurring in the evaluation of @xmath72 are rather cumbersome and are thus solved numerically .",

    "we are now in a position to present our numerical analysis of the inclusive production of prompt @xmath0 mesons in association with prompt photons in two - photon collisions with direct photon interactions at nlo in the nrqcd factorization framework .",
    "we consider tesla in its @xmath4 mode with @xmath77  gev , where the photons are produced via bremsstrahlung and beamstrahlung .",

    "the @xmath73 dependence is unscreened and introduces an appreciable theoretical uncertainty .",
    "our nlo result does not involve any factorization scale and is thus formally independent of single - resolved photoproduction and photon fragmentation .",
    "we found that the inclusion of the nlo correction leads to a substantial reduction in cross section , especially towards large values of @xmath25 and in the central region of the @xmath121 range .",
    "in fact , the @xmath137 factor falls below 0.1 for @xmath149  gev .",
    "these features could be traced to the ( @xmath143-subtracted ) virtual correction , which makes up the bulk of the nlo correction .    in order to complete the nlo treatment of @xmath41",
    ", we still need to evaluate the nlo corrections to single- and double - resolved photoproduction . due to the occurrence of fragmentation - prone partonic subprocesses ,",
    "these are expected to lead to a substantial enhancement in the case of single - resolved photoproduction . nevertheless , it is unlikely that the dominance of direct photoproduction will be challenged at nlo .",
    "then , also @xmath150 production in photoproduction at hera and hadroproduction at the tevatron can be described at nlo .",
    "this will help to provide a solid basis for an ultimate test of the nrqcd factorization framework .",
