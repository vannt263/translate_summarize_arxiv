    "search for companions to brown dwarfs ( bds ) are of primary interest for understanding bd formation , for which no widely accepted model exists ( e.g. luhman et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the frequency and properties of bds in multiple systems are fundamental parameters in formation models , e.g. embryo - ejection scenarios for bd formation predict only few bd binaries in preferentially close orbits , while isolated fragmentation scenarios are expected to generate bd binaries with similar ( scaled - down ) properties as stellar binaries have .",
    "however , binary properties of bds are poorly constrained for close separations : most of the current surveys for companions to bds and very low - mass stars ( vlms , @xmath6 ) are done by direct ( adaptive optics or hst ) imaging ( e.g. burgasser et al .",
    "2007 ) and are not sensitive to close separations ( @xmath73au ) .",
    "these surveys find a lower frequency ( 10 - 30% ) of bd / vlm binaries compared to stars and a separation distribution with a peak around 310au .",
    "the observed peak of the separation distribution is close to the incompleteness limit .",
    "it has been suggested that bd / vlm binaries with a separation @xmath43au are as frequent or even more frequent than those at @xmath53au ( pinfield et al 2003 ; maxted & jeffries 2005 ; burgasser et al .",
    "hence , the peak of the bd / vlm binary separation distribution could lie below 3au .",
    "given these limits of the current observational data , the question arises if our current picture of bd / vlm binaries is complete , or , whether we miss a significant fraction of very close and/or small mass ratio systems .",
    "spectroscopic monitoring for radial velocity ( rv ) variations provides a means to detect very close binaries .",
    "while several spectroscopic surveys for companions of bd / vlms in young cluster ( e.g. joergens 2006 ; maxted et al .",
    "2008 ) and in the field ( e.g. guenther & wuchterl 2003 ; basri & reiners 2006 ) have been started in recent years , data sampling is sparse in most cases and the number of confirmed close companions to bd / vlms is still small ( only four , e.g. stassun et al .",
    "2006 ; joergens & mller 2007 ) .",
    "furthermore , the determination of the binary frequency of bd / vlms in these surveys is limited to @xmath80.10.6au .",
    "this leaves still a significant unprobed gap between the separations studied by rv surveys and those probed by direct imaging surveys ( @xmath53au ) .",
    "this was closed recently by follow - up uves observations within the framework of an rv survey in the chamaeleoni star - forming region ( joergens 2008 ) .",
    "it allowed for the first time to probe the important separation range 13au for bd / vlms , as outlined in the following .",
    "an rv survey is carried out for close ( planetary and bd ) companions to very young bd / vlms in chai with the uves spectrograph at the vlt .",
    "including very recent data ( joergens 2008 ) , this survey is sensitive to companions at orbital distances of 3au and smaller with a detection rate of 50% or more , as shown by a monte - carlo simulation ( see fig.[fig : pdetect ] ) . for bd / vlm binaries with a mass ratio close to unity ( @xmath90.8 ) ,",
    "the survey is sensitive to even larger separations .",
    "this is a significant extension to larger orbital separations compared to previous results of this survey ( joergens 2006 ) as well as compared to other rv surveys of young bd / vlms ( kurosawa et al 2006 ; prato 2007 ; maxted et al . 2008 ) , which cover separations @xmath80.3au , and to other surveys of field bd / vlms ( reid et al 2002 ; guenther & wuchterl 2003 ; basri & reiners 2006 ) , which cover separations @xmath80.6au ( comparison based on @xmath10 between 0.2 and 1 , 3.3@xmath11 detection , 50% detection probability ; cf .",
    "joergens 2008 for more details ) .",
    "thus , for the first time , the binary frequency of bd / vlms is probed for the whole separation range @xmath43au with a sensitivity also to small mass ratio systems .",
    "comparison of detection probability of different bd / vlms radial velocity surveys .",
    "solid ( red ) line : joergens 2008 ; dotted ( black ) line : basri & reiners 2006 ; dashed ( blue ) line : guenther & wuchterl 2003 ; dash - dotted ( green ) line : kurosawa et al .",
    "2006 . calculation based on monte - carlo simulation .",
    "see text for more details on used parameters . from joergens ( 2008 ) . ]",
    "two objects were identified as spectroscopic binaries based on significant rv variability ( @xmath12 test with 3.3@xmath11 threshold ) .",
    "this corresponds to an observed binary fraction of 18@xmath0% for the whole sample of eleven bds and ( very ) low - mass stars ( m@xmath13 ) and 10@xmath1% for the subsample of ten bd / vlms ( m@xmath2 ) , respectively .",
    "the detected binaries are : ( i ) the bd / vlms chah@xmath38 ( m5.75-m6.5 ) , which has a substellar rv companion in a @xmath141au orbit , as previously discovered ( joergens & mller 2007 , see fig.[cha8 ] ) .",
    "chah@xmath38 is likely the lowest mass rv companion found so far around a bd / vlms .",
    "( ii ) the low - mass star chxr74 ( m4.25-m4.5 ) , which has a spectroscopic companion in a relatively long period orbit ( presumably @xmath512  years ) .    these spectroscopic binaries appear to have orbital periods of at least a few years , i.e. orbital separations of 1au or greater .",
    "there were no signs found for the presence of shorter period companions around the targets .",
    "this is noteworthy because those cause larger rv signals and are , therefore , easier to detect .",
    "thus , while the rate of bd / vlm binaries at @xmath83au is found to be 10% ( 18% including chxr74 ) , at separations @xmath41au it might be smaller than 10% ( 0/11 for the whole sample and 0/10 for the bd / vlms subsample , respectively ) .",
    "discovery of low - mass rv companion orbiting the young bd / vlms chah@xmath38 based on uves / vlt data obtained between 2000 and 2008 ( partly published in joergens&mller2007 ) .",
    "overplotted is the best - fit kepler orbit ( semi - amplitude 1.6kms@xmath15 , period 4.8years , eccentricity @xmath16=0.28 ) .",
    "the derived estimate ( model dependent ) for the companion minimum mass m@xmath17 is 1722m@xmath18 .",
    ", scaledwidth=44.0% ]    for the first time the binary frequency of bd / vlms is probed in the orbital separation range 13au ( joergens 2008 ) .",
    "the separation distribution of bd / vlm binaries detected by direct imaging surveys ( e.g. burgasser et al . 2007 ) has a peak around 310au which is close to the incompleteness limit of these surveys .",
    "it seemed , therefore , possible that the largest fraction of bd / vlm binaries has separations in the range of about 13au and remained yet undetected .",
    "the here determined bd / vlm binary frequency of 10@xmath1% at separations of 3au and smaller shows that this is not the case : the rate of spectroscopic binaries at @xmath43au is not significantly exceeding the rate of resolved binaries at larger separations ( 1030% , e.g. burgasser et al .",
    "thus , the separation range @xmath43au missed by direct imaging surveys is not adding a significant fraction to the bd / vlm binary frequency and the overall binary frequency of bd / vlms is in the range 10 - 30% .",
    "the finding of no signs ( 0/10 , i.e. @xmath810% ) for companions at @xmath41au is consistent with a decline of the separation distribution of bd / vlm binaries towards smaller separations starting between 1 and 3au .",
    "further , the previous finding that the observed mass - dependent decrease of the stellar binary frequency extends continuously into the bd regime ( e.g. burgasser et al . 2007 ) is confirmed here for separations @xmath43au . this is consistent with a continuous formation mechanism from low - mass stars to bds .",
    "the here presented results are based on a relatively small sample . by combining this work in chai with surveys of other young regions , which are restricted to separations @xmath80.3au , an overall observed binary fraction of very young bd / vlms",
    "can be determined with better statistics but with a more limited separation range . in this way , a binary frequency of 7@xmath19% ( 7/97 ) is found at @xmath80.3au . in the near future , the sample of the survey in chai will be substantially enlarged allowing the re - investigation of the binary frequency at @xmath43au of bd / vlms in chai with significantly improved statistics for a uniformly obtained data set .",
    "current and future observational efforts are , in addition , directed towards determination of orbital parameters of the detected binary systems including rv follow - up and high - resolution imaging / astrometry .",
