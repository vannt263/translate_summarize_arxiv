    "in the 1960 s , belinskii , khalatnikov , and lifshitz ( bkl ) developed a formalism to analyze the approach to the singularity in spatially inhomogneous cosmologies @xcite .",
    "they argued that , while one can construct , over any short time interval , a local kasner solution @xcite , this type of solution can not be maintained indefinitely since terms inconsistent with it can not remain subdominant .",
    "rather , the generic solution will behave as a spatially homogeneous mixmaster cosmology @xcite at every spatial point . for a long time , this analysis remained controversial , primarily due to its non - rigorous nature .",
    "recently , in a series of papers @xcite , we and our collaborators have used an analytic method , simpler than but not unrelated to that of bkl , along with detailed numerical simulations to provide strong support for the bkl picture .",
    "in addition , our methods have clarified how einstein s equations control the approach to the singularity .",
    "the essence of our method of consistent potentials ( mcp ) developed originally by grubisi and moncrief @xcite is to solve the velocity term dominated ( vtd ) equations obtained by neglecting all terms containing spatial derivatives in einstein s equations .",
    "we then substitute the asymptotic form of the vtd solution ( with spatially dependent parameters ) into the neglected terms .",
    "if these terms are all exponentially small , the vtd solution is consistent .",
    "this in turn supports a conjecture that the approach to the singularity is asymptotically vtd ( avtd )  i.e. , at almost every spatial point , the full solution comes arbitrarily close to a vtd solution as the singularity is approached @xcite . on the other hand , if one or more of the neglected terms grows exponentially , then the vtd solution is inconsistent so that the conjectured behavior is not avtd .",
    "if two or more previously neglected terms will alternately always grow for any range of vtd solution parameters , then the mcp predicts that the solution will be oscillatory and the oscillations will persist forever .",
    "if there exists a range of parameter values consistent with a vtd solution almost everywhere , the prediction is that oscillations will persist only until the parameters are driven into the consistent range @xcite . for the mcp to predict the correct behavior , the only dynamically significant time dependences , sufficiently close to the singularity",
    ", must be the linear ones from the vtd solutions which appear in the arguments of the exponential potentials .",
    "perhaps surprisingly then , the mcp predictions have been verified by numerical simulation of the full einstein equations in all models we have studied so far @xcite .",
    "the previous discussion of the application of the mcp makes no appeal to an invariant description of the system .",
    "one then wonders whether or how this picture depends on the choice of variables and of spacetime slicing .",
    "there is also an issue of the nature of oscillatory behavior observed in spatially inhomogeneous cosmologies @xcite .",
    "the bkl claim is that these models should evolve as a vacuum bianchi type ix ( mixmaster ) universe at every spatial point . in the mcp",
    "applied to the minisuperspace ( mss ) picture of vacuum , homogeneous bianchi type ix models , the vtd is the kasner solution .",
    "this solution is inconsistent with maintaining exponential smallness of the three exponential wall terms in the mss potential  leading to the usual infinite sequence of bounces off a closed triangular potential @xcite .",
    "however , we found that vacuum @xmath0 symmetric cosmologies on @xmath1 exhibit oscillations between two potentials ( rather than three ) at every spatial point @xcite . at the time",
    ", we did not know if these represented `` true '' mixmaster oscillations or something else .    in this paper",
    ", we shall describe spatially homogeneous bianchi type ix universes on @xmath4 as @xmath0 symmetric cosmologies with the same topology by rewriting the bianchi type ix spatial metric in a coordinate frame @xcite .",
    "the objective of this exercise is to see how the standard mixmaster oscillations are described in the @xmath0 variables used in our previous studies .",
    "we find that the relationship between the mss and @xmath0 descriptions of the mixmaster universe is not trivial . in the coordinate representation of the bianchi type ix homogeneous space ,",
    "one of the killing vectors is still manifest and is taken to play the role of the spatial @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the norm of that killing vector is the key variable in our previous description of generic , spatially inhomogeneous @xmath0 models .",
    "here we find its behavior to be dominated by the largest logarithmic scale factor ( lsf ) of the standard bkl description .",
    "the bounces off one of the @xmath0 potentials occur when the time derivative of the dominant lsf changes sign .",
    "this is what happens in the standard mss picture in a bounce off any of the three potential walls .",
    "the other @xmath0 potential causes a bounce when one lsf loses its dominant place to another in the mss picture .",
    "this correspondance will be discussed extensively in this paper .",
    "although numerical analysis of inhomogeneous @xmath0 symmetric cosmologies revealed only the two types of bounces described above , our study of the @xmath0-mss correspondance for the mixmaster universe demonstrates that a third type of bounce can occur  at the end of a bkl era @xcite  when the monotonically decreasing smallest lsf starts increasing and overtakes the middle one .",
    "this yields a qualitative prediction  not yet observed numerically  which can distinguish between local mixmaster dynamics and other oscillatory behavior .    in section",
    "ii , we shall review the mss picture and , in section iii , the @xmath0 variables .",
    "note that in this paper , we shall often use `` @xmath0 '' to refer to properties of the @xmath0 symmetric cosmologies .",
