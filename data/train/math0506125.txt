    "let us consider a portfolio of @xmath0 loans .",
    "let the notional of loan @xmath1 be equal to the fraction @xmath2 of the notional of the whole portfolio .",
    "this means that if loan @xmath1 defaults and the entire notional of the loan is lost the portfolio loses fraction @xmath2 or @xmath3 of its value . in practice",
    "when a loan @xmath1 defaults a fraction @xmath4 of its notional will be recovered by the creditors . thus the actual loss given default ( lgd ) of loan @xmath1 is @xmath5 fraction or @xmath6 of the notional of the entire portfolio .",
    "we now describe the gaussian m - factor model of portfolio losses from default .",
    "the model requires a number of input parameters . for each loan",
    "@xmath1 we are give a probability @xmath7 of its default .",
    "also for each @xmath1 and each @xmath8 we are given a number @xmath9 such that @xmath10 .",
    "the number @xmath9 is the loading factor of the loan @xmath1 with respect to factor @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath12 and @xmath13 be independent standard normal random variables .",
    "let @xmath14 be the cdf of the standard normal distribution . in our model loan @xmath1 defaults if @xmath15 this indeed happens with probability @xmath7 .",
    "the factors @xmath16 are usually interpreted as the state of the global economy , the state of the regional economy , the state of a particular industry and so on .",
    "thus they are the factors that affect the default behavior of all or at least a large group of loans in the portfolio .",
    "the factors @xmath17 are interpreted as the idiosyncratic risks of the loans in the portfolio .",
    "let @xmath18 be defined by @xmath19 we define the random loss caused by the default of loan @xmath1 as @xmath20 where @xmath4 is the recovery rate of loan @xmath1 .",
    "the total loss of the portfolio is @xmath21    an important property of the gaussian factor model is that the @xmath22 s are not independent of each other .",
    "their mutual dependence is induced by the dependence of each @xmath22 on the common factors @xmath16 .",
    "historical data supports the conclusion that losses due to defaults on different loans are correlated with each other .",
    "historical data can also be used to calibrate the loadings @xmath9.the @xmath22 s are not independent of each other .",
    "their mutual dependence is induced by the dependence of each @xmath22 on the common factors @xmath16 .",
    "historical data supports the conclusion that losses due to defaults on different loans are correlated with each other .",
    "historical data can also be used to calibrate the loadings @xmath9 .",
    "when the values of the factors @xmath16 are fixed , the probability of the default of loan @xmath1 becomes @xmath24    the random losses @xmath22 become conditionally independent bernoulli variables with the mean given by @xmath25 and the variance given by @xmath26    by the central limit theorem the conditional distribution of the portfolio loss @xmath23 given the values of the factors @xmath16 can be approximated by the normal distribution with the mean @xmath27 and the variance    @xmath28    then the joint distribution of the factors @xmath16 and the portfolio loss @xmath23 can be approximated by a distribution with density @xmath29 where @xmath30 stands for the gaussian density with mean @xmath31 and variance @xmath32 .",
    "let @xmath33 . we define a tranche loss profile @xmath34 by @xmath35 number @xmath36",
    "is called the attachment point of a tranche , while @xmath37 is called the detachment point of a tranche .",
    "the expected loss of a tranche is then @xmath38 this can be rewritten as a double integral @xmath39 the inside integral with respect to @xmath23 is easily done analytically because @xmath23 has a simple normal distribution for fixed values of the factors @xmath16 .",
    "the outside integral has to be computed numerically .",
    "however , since it is an integral of a bounded smooth function with respect to m - dimensional gaussian density , it is one of the simpler integrals to compute numerically .",

    "however , since it is an integral of a bounded smooth function with respect to m - dimensional gaussian density , it is one of the simpler integrals to compute numerically .",
    "in this section we apply the proposed algorithm to the single factor gaussian model of a portfolio with 125 names . we choose a 125 name portfolio because it is the size of the standard djcdx.na.ig portfolio .",
    "we choose a single factor model because it is the one most frequently used in practice .",
    "we evaluate the expected loss for four different tranches .",
    "all tranches have attachment point @xmath40 or @xmath41 .",
    "the detachment points are 3% , 7% , 10% and 15% .",
    "we take these detachment points because they are the ones most frequently used in practice in order to evaluate the base correlation .",
    "the parameters of the porfolio are @xmath42 in figure [ resultsfig ] we compare the expected loss computed using @xmath43 monte carlo samples with the expected loss computed using formula ( [ theformula ] ) .",
    "the agreement between the two is good .",
    "[ resultsfig ]    to obtain the results in figure [ resultsfig ] we only needed to perform a single one dimensional numerical integration for each tranche .",
    "this is an improvement over the moody s ft method @xcite which requires computing a large number of fourier transforms for each tranche .",
    "each individual fourier transform is as computationally expensive as ( [ theformula ] ) .",
    "when the approximation to the conditional distribution of @xmath23 given by the central limit theorem is deemed insufficiently accurate , an arbitrarily accurate representation of the conditional distribution of the portfolio loss @xmath23 can be obtained from its hermite series expansion . for historical reasons this expansion is also known as the charlier series expansion @xcite , @xcite .",
    "let @xmath44 be the c.d.f . of the conditional distribution of the portfolio loss @xmath23 .",
    "so that @xmath45 for each fixed value of the factors @xmath16 we define the normalized conditional loss @xmath46 by @xmath47 let @xmath48 be the c.d.f . of the distribution of the normalized conditional portfolio loss @xmath46 . so that @xmath49 we define the hermite polynomial @xmath50 of degree @xmath51 by @xmath52 let @xmath53 be defined by @xmath54 then we have @xmath55 the series above converges in the sense of distributions ( generalized functions ) @xcite .",
    "a good reference on the theory of distributions ( generalized functions ) is @xcite .",
    "let us pick a finite @xmath0 .",
    "then we have @xmath56 as before the approximation is in the sense of generalized functions .",
    "equation ( [ expn ] ) implies that the distribution of the normalized conditional portfolio loss @xmath46 can be approximated by a distribution with the density @xmath57 the function @xmath58 is not necessarily nonnegative and therefore may not be a probability density in the strict sense .",
    "however , as is explained in @xcite , this does not affect the validity of our final result ( [ theformula ] ) .",
    "therefore we may treat @xmath58 as a real probability density .",
    "the distribution of the unnormalized loss @xmath23 can be approximated by a distribution with density @xmath59    the joint distribution of the factors @xmath16 and the portfolio loss @xmath23 can be approximated by a distribution with density @xmath60 where @xmath61 stands for the gaussian density with mean @xmath62 and variance @xmath63 .",
    "observe that the coefficient @xmath53 depends only on the moments of the distribution @xmath48 .",
    "since @xmath22 s are independent bernoulli random variables these moments are known analytically .",
    "thus in the case under consideration all the @xmath53 s are known analytically .",
    "if in equation ( [ den1 ] ) we set @xmath64 we obtain the normal density approximation proposed in the previous section .",
    "we show later that it gives good numerical results even when the portfolio size is too small for the normal approximation to be accurate .",
    "in this section we test the proposed algorithm on several portfolios of smaller size . for these portfolios",
    "the approximation to the conditional distribution of the portfolio loss @xmath23 given by the central limit theorem is not very accurate , because of their small size .",
    "however , the hermite expansion produces very good results .",
    "we apply the proposed algorithm to the single factor gaussian model of a portfolio with @xmath51 names .",
    "we take @xmath51 to be 25 ( size of dj itraxx australia ) , 30 ( size of dj itraxx ex japan ) , 50 ( size of dj itraxx cj ) and 100 ( size of djcdx.na.hy ) .",
    "we choose a single factor model because it is the one most frequently used in practice . for each @xmath51",
    "we compute the loss of the equity tranche with the attachment point @xmath40 or @xmath41 and the detachment point 3% .",
    "the parameters of the porfolio are @xmath66 where @xmath67 .",
    "finally , we choose @xmath68 in ( [ expn ] ) .    in figure [ resultsfig2 ] we compare the expected loss computed using @xmath43 monte carlo samples with the expected loss computed using formula ( [ theformula2 ] ) .",

    "the proposed algorithm is fast because the inside integral in ( [ theformula2 ] ) can be done analytically .",
    "we also comment that the algorithm can be extended trivially to the case of non - constant recovery rates and recovery rates correlated with the state of the factor variables .",
