    "the study of harmonic ( or hitting ) measure for brownian motion is a well developed subject with dramatic achievements and major problems which are still wide open , see  @xcite . in this note",
    "we present a couple of problems regarding hitting measure for a wider class of random processes and obtain one result .    when does one dimensional brownian motion starting at @xmath5 , hits an independent brownian motion starting at @xmath2 , which serves as the _ barrier _ ?",

    ", there is a singular time set ( which is a function of the barrier only ) that a.s .",
    "contains the first hitting time of the barrier .",

    "reroot the origin of @xmath6 at a uniformly chosen point of @xmath7 , and rotate @xmath6 with an independent uniformly chosen angel , around it s root .",
    "look at the hitting point of this random translation and rotation of @xmath6 on the boundary of the domain @xmath8 . for every root in @xmath7 the hitting point maps the uniform measure on directions @xmath9 $ ] to a measure on @xmath8 .",
    "for any @xmath6 and @xmath7 , for almost every root , the corresponding measure on @xmath8 has @xmath5 two dimensional lebesgue measure .    moreover ,    for any @xmath6 and @xmath7 , for almost every root , the corresponding measure on @xmath8 has hausdorff dimension ( at most ) one ?",
    "it is of interest to prove even that dimension drops below @xmath10 . or better below the dimension of @xmath8",

    "if @xmath6 is a brownian path then makarov s theorem @xcite gives an affirmative answer . for partial results on this conjecture when @xmath6 is a straight line see  @xcite .",
    "by makarov s theorem  @xcite ( and jones and wolff  @xcite for general domains ) and it s adaptation by lawler  @xcite via coupling to simple random walk , it is know that the dimension of the hitting measure for two dimensional brownian motion drops to ( at most ) @xmath2 .",

    "e.g. if the process starting at @xmath16 is a two dimensional fbm with hurst parameter @xmath20 , then as @xmath20 decreases the probability it hits the @xmath21 tip is growing ( maybe it is about @xmath22 ? )    one can ask similar a question for the graph of one dimensional fbm and sle curves .",

    "in the proof we will make use of the following standard fact from measure theory .",
    "[ prop : disintegration ] let @xmath29 be probability measures on @xmath30 , a product of standard borel spaces . consider the disintegration of @xmath29 with respect to the @xmath31-variable ( i.e. with respect to the canonical projection @xmath32 ) . we write it as follows : @xmath33 @xmath34 where @xmath35 ( resp .",
    "@xmath36 ) is the pushforward of @xmath37 ( resp @xmath38 ) under @xmath32 , and @xmath39 ( resp .",

    "@xmath39 is singular to @xmath40 for @xmath35-almost all @xmath17    another fact we will need is the bessel(3)-like behavior of the brownian motion immediately before hitting a constant barrier .",
    "this is an immediate consequence of williams brownian path decomposition theorem ( e.g. theorem vii.4.9 in @xcite ) .",
    "[ prop : bessel3 ] consider a brownian motion @xmath23 starting from @xmath5 , and let @xmath42 .",

    "the latter is exactly the conditional distribution of @xmath26 given @xmath24 . by proposition [ prop : disintegration ] (",
    "applied to @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) , almost sure singularity of @xmath52 to the ( determinstic ) lebesgue measure is equivalent to the singularity of @xmath53 to @xmath54 . on the other hand , the two spaces @xmath31 and",
    "@xmath55 in proposition [ prop : disintegration ] play symmetric roles , so instead one may disintegrate with respect to the @xmath56 variable .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath57 ( resp .",
    "@xmath58 ) be the disintegration of @xmath53 ( resp .",
    "@xmath59 ) with respect to @xmath60 .",
    "then the @xmath61-almost sure singularity of @xmath62 with respect to the lebesgue measure is equivalent to the singularity of @xmath63 with respect to @xmath61 for lebesgue - almost all @xmath60 . on the other hand , the measures @xmath53 and @xmath59 agree when restricted to the @xmath64-algebra @xmath65 ; therefore , @xmath63 and @xmath66 agree on @xmath67 for lebesgue - almost all @xmath60 .",
    "since @xmath62 is measurable with respect to @xmath67 , it is enough to verify that @xmath66 is singular to @xmath61 when restricted to @xmath67 .",
    "using proposition [ prop : bessel3 ] we can characterize @xmath66 explicitly , at least up to equivalence .",
    "indeed , the time when @xmath23 hits @xmath27 is exactly the time when @xmath68 which is itself a standard brownian motion under @xmath61 , hits the constant barrier @xmath69 .",
    "thus by proposition [ prop : bessel3 ] , the distribution of @xmath70 under @xmath66 is ( locally ) equivalent to bessel(3 ) . on the other hand , @xmath71 is @xmath61-independent of @xmath31 , and since the @xmath26 is measurable with respect to @xmath31 , the independent part @xmath55 is not affected by our change of measure .",
    "thus under @xmath66 , @xmath31 and @xmath55 are still independent , and @xmath72 remains ( locally ) equivalent to a brownian motion .    in order to prove the singularity result we only need the restriction of our measures to @xmath67 .",
    "since @xmath73 we see that under @xmath66 , @xmath74 is locally equivalent to a combination of a bessel(3 ) and an independent brownian motion . under @xmath75 , however , it is locally a brownian motion .",
    "thus the problem reduces to the proving that the local behaviour at time zero of the sum of independent processes @xmath76 is almost surely distinguishable from that of @xmath77 , where @xmath78 .",
    "this can be achieved by , say , noting that these processes satisfy a law of iterated logarithm with different almost sure constants .",
