    "let @xmath0 be a finite dimensional complex reductive lie algebra .",
    "crystals were introduced by kashiwara as a combinatorial structure arising from the @xmath1 limit of a representation of the quantum group @xmath2 .",
    "roughly , a crystal is a directed graph where the edges are labelled by simple roots of @xmath0 and the vertices are labelled by weights of @xmath3 .",
    "crystals can be tensored together to produce a crystal whose underlying set is the product of the two underlying sets .",
    "this tensor product is not symmetric in the sense that the map @xmath4 is not an isomorphism from @xmath5 to @xmath6 .    in this work ,",
    "following an idea of arkady berenstein we construct natural isomorphisms @xmath7 for crystals of finite - dimensional reductive lie algebras .",
    "the basic idea is to first produce a involution @xmath8 for each crystal @xmath9 , which flips the crystal by exchanging highest weight elements with lowest weight elements .",
    "then we define : @xmath10 we call this natural isomorphism @xmath11 the * commutor*.    the commutor which we construct for crystals does not obey the axioms for a braided monoidal category .",
    "instead we see that :    1 .",
    "@xmath12 2 .",
    "the following diagram commutes : @xmath13_{\\sigma_{a , b } \\otimes 1 } \\ar[r]^{1 \\otimes \\sigma _ { b , c } } & a \\otimes c \\otimes b \\ar[d]^{\\sigma_{a , c \\otimes b}}\\\\ b \\otimes a \\otimes c \\ar[r]_{\\sigma_{b \\otimes a , c } } & c \\otimes b \\otimes a \\\\ } \\ ] ]    our method requires @xmath0 to be finite - dimensional since we use the long element of the weyl group in order to produce the involution @xmath14",
    ". it would be interesting to see if there exists a commutor satisfying ( i ) , ( ii ) for the category of highest weight crystals of an affine ( or more generally kac - moody ) lie algebra .",
    "recall that the category of representations of @xmath15 has a natural braiding which is constructed using the universal r matrix .",
    "this braiding is not symmetric but it does obey the hexagon axiom and so endows the category of representations of @xmath15 with the structure of a braided monoidal category .",
    "so , it is perhaps surprising that the commutor that we constructed for crystals is not braided .",
    "however , following an analogous procedure to the one used for crystals , we construct a new commutor for the representations of @xmath15 which obeys ( i ) , ( ii ) . using the canonical basis",
    ", we relate this commutor to our commutor for crystals .      in @xcite , drinfeld defined a coboundary category to be a monoidal category along with a commutor satisfying ( i ) , ( ii ) above .",
    "this name was chosen because the representation categories of coboundary hopf algebras form coboundary categories .",
    "interestingly , we stumbled across the axioms of a coboundary category in a different context : the hives and octahedron recurrence of knutson , tao and woodward @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for the relation between these axioms and certain properties of the octahedron recurrence .",
    "the connection to crystals was made when we found an equivalence of categories between the category of hives and the category of @xmath16 crystals ( see @xcite ) .",
    "motivated by the example of crystals , we study the structure of coboundary categories . in braided cactgories , we have the braid group which acts naturally on multiple tensor products .",
    "there is an analogue of it for coboundary categories .",
    "we identify its structure , and call it the * cactus group .",
    "it is the group which acts naturally on multiple tensor products of objects in a coboundary category . *    in a coboundary category , the basic maps between repeated tensor products are reversals of intervals : @xmath17 for @xmath18 .",
    "the cactus group is a group with these generators and some natural relations ( see section [ se : cacgr ] ) .",
    "the cactus group surjects onto @xmath19 and its kernel is the fundamental group of the deligne - mumford compactification , @xmath20 , of the moduli space of real genus 0 curves with @xmath21 marked points .",
    "the generator @xmath22 corresponds to a path in @xmath23 in which the marked points @xmath24 bubble off onto a new component and then return to the main component in the reversed order .",
    "the cactus group in relation to this fundamental group first appeared in the work of devadoss @xcite and davis - januszkiewicz - scott @xcite .",
    "elements of this moduli space look somewhat like cacti from the genus opuntia .",
    "this justifies the name cactus group . in a similar vein",
    ", we would like to propose the name cactus categories for coboundary categories , just as braided categories have replaced the earlier name of quasi - triangular categories .",
    "we would like to thank a. berenstein for explaining to us the construction of the commutor for crystals .",
    "we also benefited from helpful conversations with l. bartholdi , p. etingof , a. knutson , n. reshetikhin , n. snyder , and d. thurston .",
    "the second author wishes to thank y. lai for her hospitality during a visit to davis and for drawing our attention to the work of s. devadoss .",

    "consider the crystals which correspond the dual and the symmetric square of the standard representation of @xmath54 .",
    "then their tensor product is :      we call a crystal * connected * if the underlying graph ( where @xmath55 are joined by an edge if @xmath56 for some @xmath57 ) is connected",

    "however , uniqueness does exist for families .",
    "let @xmath64 be a family of crystals such that @xmath65 is a highest weight crystal of highest weight @xmath66 .",
    "we say that @xmath67 is a * closed family * if @xmath68 is an inclusion of crystals .",
    "[ thm : uniqueness ] there exists a unique closed family of crystals @xmath69 .",
    "there are a number of ways to construct these @xmath65 : combinatorially using littelmann s path model @xcite , representation theoretically using crystal bases of a quantum group representation @xcite , and geometrically using subvarieties of the affine grassmannian @xcite .",
    "each of these construction also produces the inclusions @xmath70 .",
    "if @xmath71 , then we can take @xmath65 to be the set of semi - standard young tableaux of shape @xmath60 .",
    "the weight function is the usual weight of a tableau and the action of @xmath62 is by the lascoux - schtzenberger operator and changes an @xmath57 in the tableau to an @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "in addition to being highest weight , these crystals are also lowest weight .",
    "[ thm : lowestweight ] the crystals @xmath65 possess a unique lowest weight element @xmath73 of weight @xmath74 .",
    "the @xmath73 are annihilated by all @xmath75 and generate @xmath65 under the action of the @xmath76 .",
    "since the elements of @xmath65 are partially ordered by their weight and the @xmath46 decrease the weight , it suffices to prove that there is a unique element annihilated by all the @xmath75 .",
    "it is possible to prove this using crystal bases but we will give a purely combinatorial proof .",
    "we appeal to the lakshmibai - seshadri chain model .",
    "this is a particular case of the littelmann path model where we start with a straight line path . in this model : @xmath77 where the @xmath78 are rational and @xmath79 denotes the @xmath80-bruhat order .",
    "see stembridge @xcite for more details . for our present purposes ,",
    "all we need is that if @xmath79 , then @xmath81 .",
    "we identify @xmath82 with the piecewise constant function @xmath83 \\rightarrow w \\cdot \\lambda $ ] which equals @xmath84 if @xmath85 .    by @xcite",
    ", we see that : @xmath86    suppose that @xmath87 is killed by all the @xmath46 .",
    "then @xmath88 for all @xmath89 .",
    "hence for all @xmath57 , @xmath90 . hence @xmath91 . hence @xmath92 (",
    "since @xmath93 is smaller than any other element in @xmath94 ) .",
    "so the unique element of @xmath65 killed by all the @xmath46 is @xmath95 .",
    "the category @xmath96-@xmath97 is the category whose objects are crystals @xmath31 such that each connected component of @xmath31 is isomorphic to some @xmath65 . for the rest of this paper",
    ", crystal means an object in this category .",
    "a morphism of crystals is a map of the underlying sets that commutes with all the structure maps , including the two 0 elements .",
    "( we might more accurately call our category the category of crystal bases of the associated quantum group , since the crystals that arise from crystal bases are exactly those of this form ) .",
    "if @xmath98 is a morphism of crystals and @xmath99 is killed by all the @xmath76 , then @xmath100 is also killed by all the @xmath62 .",
    "thus if @xmath101 and @xmath31 are highest weight crystals , then @xmath102 must take the highest weight element of @xmath101 to the highest weight element of @xmath31 .",
    "this immediately implies the following version of schur s lemma .",
    "@xmath103 contains just the identity if @xmath104 and is empty otherwise .",
    "hence if @xmath31 is a crystal there is exactly one way to identify each of its components with a @xmath65 .",
    "the more interesting structure in @xmath3-@xmath105 is the tensor product .",
    "first note that the tensor product of crystals is inherently associative : i.e. if @xmath106 are crystals then @xmath107 is an isomorphism .",
    "so we can drop parenthesization when dealing with repeated tensor products .",
    "note that the definition of the tensor product of crystals is not symmetric , i.e. the map @xmath108 is not a morphism of crystals .",
    "however we will now define isomorphisms @xmath109 .",
    "we call such a family a * commutor*. following an idea of a. berenstein ( which has not yet appeared in the literature ) , we produce these isomorphisms by first defining a `` reversing '' involutions @xmath110 for each crystal @xmath31",
    ". these will not be a morphisms of crystals , just automorphisms of the underlying graphs which exchange highest weight and lowest weight elements .",
    "such maps were also considered in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath111 be the dynkin diagram automorphism such that @xmath112 where @xmath113 denotes the long element in the weyl group of @xmath0 .",

    "moreover @xmath118 is an inclusion of crystals , where @xmath70 is the inclusion map for the original family @xmath65 .",
    "the only non - trivial thing to check is that @xmath119 is highest weight .",
    "this is the content of proposition [ thm : lowestweight ] .    by theorem [ thm : uniqueness ] and",
    "schur s lemma , the above lemma gives us a crystal isomorphism @xmath120 .",
    "composing with the map of sets @xmath121 given by @xmath122 , we get a map of sets @xmath123 . from the crystal structure on @xmath115",
    "we see that :    @xmath124    for all @xmath125 .    in the case",
    "@xmath71 , with the tableaux model for @xmath65 , @xmath126 is the schtzenberger involution on tableaux ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we now define @xmath110 for any crystal @xmath31 by applying the appropriate @xmath126 to each connected component .",
    "this map @xmath14 satisfies the properties in equation ( [ twistrel ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath127 is a map of crystals , hence by schur s lemma @xmath128 , and so @xmath129 for any crystal @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath47 by crystals .",

    "if @xmath134 then @xmath135 , so : @xmath136 and similarly for the other case .",
    "so @xmath137 commutes with @xmath62 .",
    "similarly , @xmath137 commutes with @xmath46 .",
    "hence @xmath137 is a map of crystals .",
    "the map @xmath137 is a natural isomorphism since both @xmath138 and @xmath139 are bijections which are natural with respect to maps of crystals ( more precisely , @xmath138 is an automorphism of the forgetful functor forget:@xmath96-@xmath140 , and @xmath141 is an automorphism of forget@xmath142 ) .",
    "note that @xmath143 .",
    "this suggests that we consider @xmath144 .",
    "in fact we have :    [ pro:2sigmas ] @xmath145 .",
    "first we note that since @xmath146 , it is also an isomorphism of crystals .",

    "let @xmath148 .",
    "then we want to show that @xmath149 . since both maps are isomorphisms of crystals , by schur s lemma it suffices to show that @xmath150 lies in the same component as @xmath151 .",
