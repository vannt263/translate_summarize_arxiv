    "muon - to - electron ( @xmath0 ) conversion in nuclei @xmath3 is a lepton flavor violating ( ) process forbidden in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "it is commonly recognized as one of the most sensitive probes of lepton flavor violation and of related physics beyond the sm ( for reviews , see  @xcite ) .",
    "the present experimental situation on conversion is as follows .",
    "there is one running experiment , sindrum ii  @xcite , and two planned ones , meco  @xcite and prime  @xcite .",
    "the sindrum ii experiment at psi  @xcite with @xmath4ti as stopping target has established the best upper bound on the branching ratio  @xcite @xmath5 the meco experiment with @xmath6al is going to start soon at brookhaven  @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of this experiment is expected to be at the level of @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "the psi experiment is also running with the very heavy nucleus @xmath8au aiming to improve the previous limit by the same experiment  @xcite up to @xmath9 .",
    "the proposed new experiment prime ( tokyo )  @xcite is going to utilize @xmath4ti as stopping target with an expected sensitivity of @xmath10 .",
    "these experimental limits would allow to set stringent limits on mechanisms of conversion and the underlying theories of . in the literature various mechanisms beyond the sm",
    "have been studied ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "they can be classified as photonic and non - photonic , that is with and without photon exchange between the lepton and nuclear vertices , respectively .",
    "these two categories of mechanisms differ significantly from each other in various respects .",
    "in fact , they receive different contributions from the new physics and also require different treatments of the effects of the nucleon and the nuclear structure .",
    "latter aspect is , in particular , attributed to the fact that the two mechanisms operate at different distances and , therefore , involve different details of the nucleon and nuclear structure .",
    "in this paper we focus on the non - photonic mechanisms of conversion .",
    "the generic effect of physics beyond the sm in conversion can be described by an effective lagrangian with all possible 4-fermion quark - lepton interactions consistent with lorentz covariance and gauge symmetry . here , our interest focuses on the vector interactions which receive a contribution from vector meson exchange .",
    "we will show that the vector meson contribution to the conversion rate is important .",
    "we start with the 4-fermion effective lagrangian describing the non - photonic @xmath11 conversion at the quark level .",
    "the most general form of this lagrangian has been derived in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we present only those terms which contribute to the coherent @xmath11 conversion : @xmath12 ,   \\label{eff - q}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the characteristic high energy scale of lepton flavor violation attributed to new physics .",
    "the summation runs over all the quark species @xmath14 .",
    "lepton and quark currents are defined as : @xmath15 , , @xmath16 the parameters @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ eff - q ] ) depend on a concrete model .",
    "the next step is the derivation of a lagrangian in terms of effective nucleon fields which is equivalent to the quark level lagrangian  ( [ eff - q ] ) .",
    "first , we write down the lepton - nucleon lagrangian of the coherent @xmath11 conversion in a general lorentz covariant form with the isospin structure of the transition operator  @xcite : @xmath18\\ , ,   \\label{eff - n } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the summation runs over the double indices @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the isoscalar @xmath21 and isovector @xmath22 nucleon currents are defined as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the nucleon isospin doublet , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "this lagrangian is supposed to be generated by the one of eq .",
    "( [ eff - q ] ) and , therefore , must correspond to the same order @xmath27 in inverse powers of the scale .",
    "the lagrangian  ( [ eff - n ] ) is the basis for the derivation of the nuclear transition operators .",
    "now one needs to relate the lepton - nucleon parameters @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ eff - n ] ) to the more fundamental lepton - quark parameters @xmath29 in eq .",
    "( [ eff - q ] ) .",
    "this implies a certain hadronization prescription which specifies the way in which the effect of quarks is simulated by hadrons . in the absence of a true theory of hadronization we rely on some reasonable assumptions and models .",
    "there are basically two possibilities for the hadronization mechanism .",
    "the first one is a direct embedding of the quark currents into the nucleon ( fig.1a ) , which we call direct nucleon mechanism ( dnm ) .",
    "the second possibility is a two stages process ( fig.1b ) .",
    "first , the quark currents are embedded into the interpolating meson fields which then interact with the nucleon currents .",
    "we call this possibility meson - exchange mechanism ( mem )",
    ". in general one expects all the mechanisms to contribute to the coupling constants @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ eff - n ] ) .",
    "however , at present the relative amplitudes of each mechanism are unknown . in view of this problem",
    "one may try to understand the importance of a specific mechanism , assuming for simplicity , that only this mechanism is operative and estimating its contribution to the process in question .",
    "we follow this procedure for the case of @xmath11 conversion and consider separately the contributions of the direct nucleon mechanism @xmath30}$ ] and the meson - exchange one @xmath31}$ ] to the couplings of the lagrangian ( [ eff - n ] ) .    in the present paper we concentrate on the meson - exchange mechanism .",
    "the contribution of the direct nucleon mechanism has been derived in ref .",

    "we present only the results of ref .",
    "@xcite relevant for our analysis which are the couplings of the vector nucleon currents in eq .",

    "these form factors are equal to the total number of the corresponding species of quarks in the nucleon and , therefore , @xmath40 , while the form factors corresponding to @xmath41 quarks are equal to zero .",
    "this is the reason why they do not contribute to the couplings of the vector nucleon current in eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) . in the next section",
    "we will show that the vector meson exchange may drastically modify this situation and introduce the contribution of strange quarks into these couplings .",
    "now let us turn to the contributions of the meson - exchange mechanism to the couplings @xmath28 of the lepton - nucleon lagrangian ( [ eff - n ] ) .",
    "the mesons which can contribute to this mechanism are the unflavored vector and scalar ones .",
    "since the case of the scalar meson candidate @xmath42 is still quite uncertain  @xcite we do not study its contribution .",
    "thus , we are left with the vector mesons .",
    "the lightest of them , giving the dominant contributions , are the isovector @xmath43 and the two isoscalar @xmath44 mesons .",
    "we use ideal singlet - octet mixing for the quark content of the @xmath45 and @xmath1 mesons  @xcite : @xmath46 and @xmath47    first , we derive the lepton - meson effective lagrangian in terms of the interpolating @xmath48 and @xmath1 fields retaining all the interactions consistent with lorentz and electromagnetic gauge invariance .",
    "it can be written as : @xmath49 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the unknown dimensionless coefficients @xmath50 to be determined from the hadronization prescription . since this lagrangian",
    "is supposed to be generated by the quark - lepton lagrangian ( [ eff - q ] ) all its terms have the same suppression @xmath51 with respect to the large scale @xmath13 .",
    "another scale in the problem is the hadronic scale @xmath52 gev which adjusts the physical dimensions of the terms in eq .",
    "( [ eff - lv ] ) .",
    "typical momenta involved in @xmath11 conversion are @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the muon mass .",
    "thus , from naive dimensional counting one expects that the contribution of the derivative terms to @xmath11 conversion is suppressed by a factor @xmath55 in comparison to the contribution of the non - derivative terms .",
    "therefore , at this step in eq .",
    "( [ eff - lv ] ) we retain only the dominant non - derivative terms .",
    "however , it is worth noting that a true hadronization theory , yet non - existing , may forbid such terms so that the expansion in eq .",
    "( [ eff - lv ] ) starts from the derivative terms . in a forthcoming paper",
    "@xcite we are going to demonstrate how this happens in a particular model of hadronization and what is the phenomenological impact of this situation .    in order to relate the parameters @xmath50 of the lagrangian ( [ eff - lv ] ) with the  fundamental \" parameters @xmath29 of the quark - lepton lagrangian ( [ eff - q ] ) we use an approximate method based on the standard on - mass - shell matching condition  @xcite @xmath56 with @xmath57 corresponding to vector",

    "the following comment is in order .",
    "the relatively large value of the @xmath78 coupling @xmath79 in eq .",

    "@xcite on the basis of the assumption on the `` maximal '' violation of the okuba - zweig - iizuka ( ozi ) rule .",
    "it was also stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite that this value corresponds to the upper limit for the @xmath78 coupling which parameterizes the full spectral function in the mass region of @xmath801 gev within @xmath1 pole dominance approximation .",
    "the inclusion of other contributions such as the @xmath81 continuum leads to a significant reduction of the @xmath82 coupling  @xcite .",
    "the detailed analysis of various meson and baryon cloud contributions to the vector @xmath78 coupling results in the value @xmath83  @xcite . in",
    "what follows , we quote this value as `` physical '' one . for completeness in our numerical analysis",
    "we consider both values of @xmath82 coupling : @xmath84 the vector meson - exchange contribution to the nucleon - lepton effective lagrangian ( [ eff - n ] ) arises in second order in the lagrangian @xmath85 and corresponds to the diagram in fig .",
    "we estimate this contribution only for the coherent @xmath11 conversion process . in this case",
    "we disregard all the derivative terms of nucleon and lepton fields . neglecting the kinetic energy of the final nucleus ,",
    "the muon binding energy and the electron mass , the momentum transfer squared @xmath38 to the nucleus has a constant value @xmath86 . in this approximation",
    "the vector meson propagators convert to @xmath87-functions leading to lepton - nucleon contact operators . comparing them with the corresponding terms in the lagrangian",

    "( [ alpha ] ) .",
    "this opens up the possibility of deriving new limits on this parameter from the experimental data on @xmath11 conversion .",

    "therefore the nuclear structure dependence of @xmath95 can always be neglected except for a very special narrow domain in the parameter space where @xmath99 .",
    "another important issue of the smallness of the ratio @xmath1 in eq .",
    "( [ rme.1 ] ) is the dominance of the isoscalar contribution associated with the coefficients @xmath100 .",
