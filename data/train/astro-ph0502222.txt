    "the cosmological evidence supporting the existence of a universal pressure - less fluid ( cold dark matter or cdm ) appears to be compelling .",
    "the amplitude of the first two acoustic peaks in the power spectrum of the cmb anisotropies as observed by wmap implies that this fluid comprises , at present , about 30% of the mass density of the universe .",
    "given the even more compelling evidence for an @xmath0 universe , most of the remainder must consist of a negative pressure `` dark energy '' component that may be identified with a positive cosmological constant ( spergel et al . 2003 , page et al . 2003 ) .",
    "it is now well - known that type 1a supernovae ( garnevitch et al .",
    "1998 , perlmutter et al . 1999 ) near @xmath1 are systematically dimmer by about 0.2 magnitudes than would be expected in an empty , `` coasting '' universe .",
    "these observations are often cited as evidence that the universe is presently dominated by this vacuum energy .",
    "but , if we can trust that systematic effects are well - understood , it is also true that the relative brightening of snia beyond @xmath2 ( tonry et al .",
    "2003 ) is equally strong evidence for matter domination at this relatively recent epoch , again implying that @xmath3 .",
    "several such independent tests have lead to the emergence of a `` concordance model '' model for the universe ( ostriker and steinhardt 1995 ) , which is now heralded as a major achievement in observational cosmology and in which cdm is a vital component .    although the large scale evidence for cdm is persuasive , the hypothesis is not without problems .",
    "while there is no shortage of candidate particles , the nature of this pressure - less fluid remains elusive .",
    "particle physics theory beyond the standard model provides no definitive prediction , and attempts at direct laboratory detection of cdm particles ( neutralinos , axions , etc . )",
    "have , so far , proved unsuccessful . moreover ,",
    "the evidence for cdm on the scale of galaxies is far from compelling , with `` complicated '' , but poorly understood , astrophysical processes being invoked to explain various observed phenomena such as the tightness of the luminosity - rotation velocity relation for disk galaxies the tully - fisher law and the presence of an upper limit on the surface brightness of galaxies the freeman law ( dalcanton et al .",
    "1997 , van den bosch & dalcanton 2000 ) .",
    "the problem of matching the predicted rotation curves of dark halos emerging from cosmic n - body simulations with those actually observed in low surface brightness galaxies has provoked an ongoing controversy ( e.g. de blok et al 2001 ) .",
    "these same phenomena , on a galaxy scale , are well - described by an ad hoc modification of newtonian dynamics , mond , suggested by milgrom ( 1983 ) .",
    "here it is proposed that , below a critical acceleration , @xmath4 , the effective gravitational acceleration , @xmath5 , approaches @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the usual newtonian acceleration .",
    "this critical acceleration is , within an order of magnitude , comparable to the velocity of light times the present value of the hubble parameter , i.e. , @xmath8 .",
    "this simple modification accounts for systematic aspects of galaxy photometry and kinematics , such as the freeman law and the tully - fisher law , as well as successfully predicting the detailed form of galaxy rotation curves from the observed distribution of detectable baryonic matter .",
    "these successes have been well - cataloged ( sanders and mcgaugh 2002 ) and suggest that galaxy phenomenology can be understood without invoking the existence of dark matter ( mcgaugh 2004a ) .",
    "mond is also not without problems . on a phenomenological level",
    ", the algorithm appears unable to account for the full mass discrepancy in rich clusters of galaxies ; it remains necessary to invoke the presence of , as yet , undetected matter in these systems ( sanders 1999 , 2003 ; aguirre et al .",
    "moreover , the idea has long been criticized as an ad hoc , empirically based hypothesis without foundation in deeper theory .",
    "the absence of a viable relativistic theory has placed the issues of cosmology , structure formation , and gravitational lensing beyond consideration in the context of mond ; that is to say , mond can not be confronted by this entire body of observed cosmic phenomena .",
    "recently , bekenstein ( 2004 ) has written down a fully covariant theory , _ teves _ , involving dynamic vector and scalar fields in addition to the usual tensor field of general relativity .",
    "this is an important development because the theory is free of the conspicuous pathologies of earlier attempts ( e.g. , acausal wave propagation , no enhanced gravitational lensing ) .",
    "however , in the theory as it now stands , there is no obvious connection between mond phenomenology and cosmology as is suggested by the near coincidence between @xmath4 and @xmath9",
    ". the free function of the theory has two discontinuous branches one for cosmology and one for mass concentrations ; it would seem difficult to follow the cosmic growth of inhomogeneities in the context of a theory in which cosmology is mathematically disconnected from inhomogeneous structure .",
    "finally , the theory does not address what is perhaps the greatest problem for mond : the large scale evidence for cdm cited above .",
    "the construction of a cosmologically effective theory of mond , and , in particular , the reconciliation of the cosmological evidence for cdm with the galaxy - scale success of mond , is the topic of the present paper .",
    "i will show here that this is a possibility in the context of a generalization of an earlier theory also due to bekenstein ( 1988a) phase coupling gravity or pcg but a generalization that requires a vector field as in teves .",
    "the basic idea is this : pcg is a scalar - tensor theory with two scalar fields , one of which couples to matter , the second determining the strength of that coupling . in a cosmological context ,",
    "the scalar field potential is an evolving effective potential which can have a well - defined minimum ( sanders 1989 ) .",
    "initially , the potential evolves faster than the scalar field can respond , but at some point , the scalar falls and oscillates about the minimum .",
    "if the bare potential has quadratic form these oscillations constitute cdm with , possibly , a long compton wavelength so long that these soft bosons can not accumulate in galaxies . at the present epoch",
    ", the matter - coupling field provides a fifth force that appears below a critical value of the scalar field gradient as in mond .",
    "cosmological cdm exists as long wavelength excitations of the coupling - strength field .",
    "i show that a preferred - frame generalization of pcg reproduces the galaxy scale phenomenology of mond .",
    "i give a numerical example of cosmological evolution which illustrates that the theory can reproduce the basic properties of the concordance model and , in particular , is consistent with the cosmological evidence for cdm .",
    "i further demonstrate that solar system phenomenology constrains the parameters of the theory and the wavelength of the bosons , but , inevitably , this fifth force must be present in the outer solar system a phenomenon possibly detected as the pioneer effect ( anderson et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the basis for the suggested scalar - tensor theories of modified dynamics is the non - relativistic , but lagrangian - based , modified poisson equation of bekenstein and milgrom ( 1984 ) : @xmath10=4\\pi g \\rho \\eqno(1)\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the function interpolating between the newtonian regime ( @xmath12 ) and the mond regime ( @xmath13 ) . in a scalar - tensor theory",
    ", @xmath14 would refer only to the scalar field and not to the total gravitational potential .",
    "that is to say , in the weak field limit , such a theory would be a two - field theory where , in addition to @xmath14 , there is the `` normal '' newtonian field satisfying the usual poisson equation .",
    "phase coupling gravitation ( pcg ) is a covariant scalar - tensor generalization for such modified gravity proposed by bekenstein ( 1988a , 1988b ) .",
    "here , the scalar field is complex ( @xmath15 ) and the field lagrangian is standard : @xmath16 \\eqno(2)\\ ] ] the non - standard aspect is that only the phase couples to matter jointly with the gravitational tensor @xmath17 , i.e. , @xmath18 , \\eqno(3)\\ ] ] this leads to the scalar field equation , @xmath19 here it is obvious that the scalar amplitude squared plays the role of the mond interpolating function @xmath11 .",
    "pcg looks like a proper field theory , with the lagrangian possessing a self - interaction potential @xmath20 as well as a standard kinetic term .",
    "bekenstein demonstrated that mond - like phenomenology in a static background can result if @xmath21 ; i.e. , galaxy phenomenology requires a `` negative sextic '' potential . in general , an attraction falling less rapidly than @xmath22 requires @xmath23 over some range of @xmath24 ( sanders 1988 ) .",
    "the theory is interesting because it can possess a viable cosmological limit where @xmath4 is identified with @xmath25 ( sanders 1989 ) , and as such , becomes a candidate for a cosmological effective theory of mond . in an isotropic , homogeneous universe ( robertson - walker ) , the equations for the cosmic evolution of the scalar phase and amplitude ( einstein conformal frame ) are @xmath26 and @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the density parameter of the baryonic matter , @xmath29 is the universal scale factor in terms of the present scale factor , time ( @xmath30 ) is in units of @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the hubble parameter in units of @xmath33 .",
    "looking at eq .",
    "6 we see that the evolution of the scalar amplitude can be described in terms of a time - dependent `` time - like '' effective potential , @xmath34 where , from eq .  5",
    ", we have @xmath35 the obvious attraction point of such a potential , @xmath36 , is a local minimum , which implies that the bare potential should be a monotonically increasing function of q , as in @xmath37 .    in a universe with inhomogeneities ,",
    "the scalar phase and amplitude are given , in the quasi - static limit by the solutions to @xmath38 @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the cosmic time derivative of the scalar phase given by eq .  5 with @xmath41 , its expectation value .",
    "thus , the solution for q involves a second time - dependent `` space - like '' effective potential given by @xmath42 that is to say , cosmology adds a time - dependent negative mass term to the bare potential . here",
    "the attraction point @xmath43 is at a local maximum .",
    "if certain very general conditions on the bare potential are satisfied , the maximum in the space - like potential occurs at the same value of @xmath24 as the minimum in the time - like potential , @xmath44 ; i.e. , the scalar amplitude asymptotically approaches its cosmic value far from a mass concentration ( sanders 1989 ) .",
    "a cosmological theory can be constructed in which the total force about a mass concentration deviates from pure newtonian below a critical value of the total acceleration as in mond , but there is a return to @xmath22 attraction on larger scale with a maximum possible mass discrepancy of @xmath45 .",
    "this predicted maximum discrepancy is not large ( @xmath46 ) so the theory does not produce extended flat rotation curves for spiral galaxies as observed ; this only seems possible in the context of bekenstein s original @xmath47 theory .",
    "apart from this phenomenological difficulty , a more fundamental problem with pcg , or any scalar - tensor theory in which the scalar couples to matter as a conformal factor multiplying the einstein metric ( eq .  3 ) , is that the scalar field does not interact with photons .",
    "this is to say , there is no enhanced gravitational lensing due to the scalar field ; lensing by large astronomical systems should reveal no `` dark matter '' in sharp contrast to the observations ( bekenstein & sanders 1994 ) .",
    "this led sanders ( 1997 ) to propose a non - conformal relation between the physical and einstein metrics involving an additional non - dynamical vector field @xmath48 pointing in the positive time direction in the preferred cosmological frame , as in the classical stratified theories ( ni 1972 ) . here",
    "the metric of the physical geometry , @xmath49 is related to the gravitational metric @xmath17 as @xmath50 this was combined with an aquadratic lagrangian theory ( bekenstein & milgrom 1984 ) to produce the phenomenology of mond along with enhanced gravitational lensing .",
    "the essential problem with this aquadratic stratified theory is the non - dynamic vector field ; such a construct violates the principle of general covariance making it impossible to define a conserved energy - momentum tensor ( jacobson & mattingly 2001 ) .",
    "this has been remedied by bekenstein ( 2004 ) who has endowed the vector field with its own dynamics and demonstrated that a theory can be constructed that is causal , that produces mond phenomenology about mass concentration , that possesses a sensible cosmological limit , and in which the relationship between the deflection of photons by a mass concentration and the total weak - field force ( scalar plus tensor ) is the same as in general relativity .",
    "the scalar action of bekenstein s tensor - vector - scalar theory , teves , is essentially that of pcg in the limit of weak coupling ( small @xmath51 ) where it can be shown that the kinetic term for the scalar amplitude , @xmath24 , can be neglected in the lagrangian ; i.e. , @xmath52 in the weak field limit this leads to a field equation equivalent to eq .  1 with @xmath53 where @xmath24 is given by the solution to @xmath54 .",
    "as a toy model , bekenstein chooses a form for @xmath20 which yields two discontinuous branches for @xmath55 ; one for negative argument that would be relevant to cosmology ; and one for positive @xmath56 , relevant to quasi - stationary systems ( mass inhomogeneities ) .",
    "here i am going to put back the kinetic term for @xmath24 .",
    "this is vital because i will identify oscillations in @xmath24 with cdm , so its dynamics must be followed fully .",
    "the idea that long - wavelength scalar field oscillations may comprise dark matter is also not new : press , ryden & spergel ( 1990 ) proposed that such `` soft bosons '' would form after a late phase transition ( after recombination ) leading to the development of density fluctuations that would be the seeds for structure formation .",
    "the suggested potential provides a compton wavelength of 30 kpc corresponding to a supposed current scale of large scale structures ( 30 mpc ) . in a unified model of dark energy and dark matter",
    ", sahni & wang ( 1999 ) also propose scalar field oscillations as dark matter and suggest that a large compton wavelength could solve several of the outstanding observational problems of cdm halos , such as the apparent absence of central density cusps and the low abundance of dwarf galaxies in the local group .",
    "they referred to such dark matter as fcdm `` frustrated cold dark matter '' .",
    "this was also considered by hu , barkana , & gruzinov ( 2000 ) who emphasize that the de broglie wavelength ( the compton wavelength extended by @xmath57 ) is the relevant clustering scale for such ` fuzzy ' cold dark matter . in the present context",
    ", the de broglie wavelength should be sufficiently long that the bosons do not accumulate in galaxies at all ; this could be termed sfcdm or `` seriously frustrated cold dark matter '' .    for galaxy or solar system phenomenology , we will see that it is necessary to take very weak coupling ( @xmath58 ) , so the scalar sector of the theory is very close to that of teves . as in the stratified theory",
    "i will not consider here the separate dynamics of the vector field ; although , a _",
    "dynamical _ vector field is a necessary requirement for general covariance , and it must be included properly in any final theory .",
    "it does appear , however , that the only consequence of the dynamical vector field in the weak field limit is a rescaling of the local gravitational constant , @xmath59 , with respect to its cosmological value ( bekenstein 2004 , carroll & lim 2004 , giannios 2005 ) .",
    "first of all , i describe a preferred - frame generalization of pcg because pcg , in a cosmological context , can not produce the phenomenology of mond .",
    "the normalized vector field , dynamical or not , takes its simplest ( time - like ) form in the cosmological frame .",
    "therefore a theory involving such a field is inevitably a preferred frame theory .",
    "moreover , the unit vector , * a * , may be used to form a second scalar field invariant @xmath60 in addition to the usual invariant @xmath61 ( sanders 1997 ) .",
    "obviously @xmath62 in the preferred cosmological frame , and @xmath63 becomes the square of the spatial gradient of @xmath14 in this frame ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "this means that we can make use of the preferred frame to separate , and manipulate separately , the spatial and time derivatives of @xmath14 at the level of the field lagrangian .",
    "therefore the theory that i consider will have the general scalar field lagrangian , @xmath65 .",
    "\\eqno(17)\\ ] ] that is to say , separate functions of @xmath24 multiply the spatial and temporal gradients of @xmath14 in the preferred frame . obviously the fields @xmath24 and @xmath14 can no longer be identified with the amplitude and phase of a complex scalar , but these fields do play the same roles as in pcg : @xmath14 is the matter coupling field and @xmath24 determines the strength of that coupling .",

    "12 , and @xmath67 is a parameter along the path .",

    "we notice that , unlike usual scalar - tensor theory , photons and other relativistic particles act as a source for @xmath14 . we also notice that in the preferred frame @xmath76 takes a particularly simple form with the space - space ( @xmath77 ) and time - time ( 0,0 ) components given by @xmath78    setting @xmath79 yields the field equation for @xmath24 : @xmath80a^\\mu a^\\nu \\phi_{,\\mu}\\phi_{,\\nu } +   v'(q ) = 0 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which , in the preferred frame , simplifies to @xmath81    the complete theory includes the einstein - hilbert action for the tensor field and , in principle , an action for the vector field , but here the separate dynamics of the vector is not included .",
    "hereafter , all operations are carried out in the preferred frame because this is where the equations assume their least complicated form .",
    "general empirical considerations constrain the form of the free functions of the theory : @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath20 .",
    "first of all , assuming homogeneity and that @xmath84 ( justified below ) , the cosmic time derivative of @xmath14 in the matter - dominated epoch is found by integrating eq . 22 : @xmath85 thus , in a cosmological setting ( @xmath86 , @xmath87 ) , the evolution of @xmath24 ( eq .  25 ) is determined by a time - like effective potential ( as in pcg ) @xmath88 with @xmath89 again given by eq",
    "i wish to identify dark matter with @xmath24 oscillations in this effective potential .",
    "the fluid represented by such oscillations has an equation of state @xmath90 , and , for a power law bare potential , it is straightforward to demonstrate that @xmath91 ( turner 1983 ) .",
    "identification of the scalar field oscillations with cdm ( @xmath92 ) requires @xmath93 ; therefore , i take @xmath94 although the theory contains an evolving component of dark energy ( quintessence ) , it will be seen below that inclusion of the bare cosmological term @xmath95 is necessary to match the concordance model .",
    "the cosmological expectation value of @xmath24 ( i.e. , @xmath36 ) is given by the solution to @xmath96 to be an attractor , this extremum in the potential must also be a minimum which requires that @xmath97 .",
    "this condition , combined with eq .",
    "29 , provides a general condition on @xmath83 ; i.e. , @xmath98 evaluated at @xmath36 .    one may question the use of such a time - dependent effective potential with a well defined minimum because @xmath99 and @xmath24 are both functions of time .",
    "but the two timescales are generally very different ; the expectation value @xmath36 varies on a cosmic timescale while the period of oscillation about @xmath36 is constant and fixed by the bare potential ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "as long as the oscillation period is much shorter than the age of the universe ( not true in the early universe ) the concept of a time - like effective potential is meaningful .    in a universe with inhomogeneities , but where @xmath101 can be neglected , we may view eq .",
    "25 as containing a space - like potential ( as in pcg ) which determines the spatial dependence of @xmath24 : @xmath102 the extremum at @xmath43 , given by the solution to @xmath103 , occurs at the same value of @xmath24 as the extremum in @xmath99 ; i.e. , @xmath104 . but",
    "the extremum in this case must be a local maximum in @xmath105 ; i.e. @xmath106 , which implies a second condition on @xmath83 ; i.e. , @xmath107 evaluated at @xmath36 .",
    "if conditions 30 and 32 are met , then the cosmological boundary condition on @xmath24 is satisfied ; i.e. , far from a mass concentration @xmath24 approaches its cosmological value .",
    "one choice for the free functions which satisfies these conditions would be @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "this is appealing because it would provide a cosmological realization of bekenstein s negative sextic effective potential in static pcg and hence mond phenomenology on an extragalactic scale .",
    "in fact , such a model leads to a scalar force rising as @xmath110 well into a galactic mass distribution ; this fifth force , in addition to the newtonian gravitational force , produces not flat but declining rotation curves in the outer parts of spiral galaxies .",
    "moreover , this theory violates precise constraints on @xmath22 attraction in the solar system .",
    "these considerations require a slight modification of the free functions : @xmath111 and @xmath112 here , in addition to the coupling strength parameter @xmath51 , a second parameter @xmath113 ( @xmath114 ) has been introduced .",
    "it may appear that the presence of three free functions , @xmath20 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 , characterized by three free parameters , @xmath115 , @xmath51 , and @xmath113 , introduces a great deal of arbitrariness into the theory .",
    "in fact , given the structure of the theory ( eq .  17 ) , the free functions must have forms similar to eqs .",
    "28 , 33 , and 34 .",
    "the potential must be quadratic to assure that @xmath92 for the dark matter component ; in the extragalactic limit , @xmath116 , it must be the case that @xmath117 and @xmath118 to yield mond phenomenology in the outskirts of galaxies ( as in pcg ) ; and in the inner solar system , it necessary that @xmath119 to assure negligible scalar field effects and precise inverse square attraction .",
    "this is a theory strongly constrained by phenomenology .",
    "the quasi - static bstv field equation for @xmath14 in the presence of mass inhomogeneities ( eq .  22 with 23 ) is : @xmath120 = { { 8\\pi g\\eta \\rho}\\over{c^2 } } ; \\eqno(35)\\ ] ] when @xmath121 , this becomes equivalent to that of static pcg , eq .  9 ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "the scalar force in the low - velocity limit is given by @xmath123 then we find , by identification of eq .  35 with eq .  1 , that the mond interpolating function @xmath11 is equivalent to @xmath124 . in the limit of weak coupling , where @xmath125 may be neglected in the lagrangian as in eq .",
    "13 , and where @xmath126 ( the outskirts of galaxies ) we may neglect the first and final terms in eq .  25 . with eqs .",
    "33 and 34 , this yields @xmath127 that is to say , in this limit the relation between @xmath24 and @xmath128 becomes algebraic ( as in teves ) .",
    "37 then implies that the mond acceleration parameter should be identified as @xmath129 where @xmath40 is in units of the inverse hubble time . in this theory , as in pcg , there is a clear cosmological origin of @xmath4 which is identified with the cosmic time derivative of the matter - coupling scalar field , @xmath130 .",
    "the acceleration parameter evolves with cosmic time , and i take @xmath131 as its current value .    far beyond a bounded mass distribution of total mass m , the scalar force ( eq .  36 )",
    "approaches @xmath132 where @xmath133 that is to say , the total force , scalar plus newtonian , becomes @xmath22 with a ratio of the total to newtonian force of @xmath134 .",
    "because of the cosmic evolution of @xmath36 it is evident that @xmath135 also evolves ; i take @xmath136 and @xmath137 to be the present values .",
    "the full solution for @xmath24 and @xmath14 about a mass concentration involves solving eq .",
    "35 simultaneously with eq .",
    "25 which , in this limit , may be written as @xmath138 where the space - like effective potential is @xmath139 with @xmath82 and @xmath83 given by eqs .",
    "33 and 34 .",
    "the basic parameters of the theory are the scalar mass - squared @xmath115 , the coupling constant @xmath51 , and an additional parameter @xmath113 which has no effect on galactic fields so long as @xmath140 .",
    "the procedure followed here is to take values of the mond acceleration parameter and maximum mass discrepancy , @xmath131 and @xmath137 , that are consistent with galaxy phenomenology in the context of mond ( i.e. , @xmath141 and @xmath142 ) and then to determine the parameters of the theory that are required by these phenomenological constraints .",
    "in fact , the values of @xmath115 and @xmath51 are not specified by these considerations but are related through the condition that @xmath143 . given eq .",
    "42 this becomes @xmath144 where , in the approximation , i have taken @xmath145 in the limit where @xmath116 ( the extragalactic limit ) and made use of eq .",
    "38 and 40 .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to assume a value of either @xmath115 or @xmath51 , and here i take @xmath146 to be consistent with weak coupling ( more physical constraints follow below ) . with @xmath147 , and @xmath148 , then @xmath149 @xmath150 ( this would correspond to a mass of about @xmath151 ev ) .    with these parameters , the solution of eqs .",
    "35 and 41 in the presence of a point mass yields the scalar force @xmath152 shown in fig .  1 as a function of radius , in units of the mond radius @xmath153 .",
    "also shown are the newtonian force and the total force .",
    "we notice that when @xmath154 the scalar force exceeds the newtonian force , and the total force falls as @xmath110 rather than @xmath22    the resulting rotation curves of spherical galaxies having the density distribution of a plummer sphere ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) and total masses of @xmath155 m@xmath156 and @xmath157 m@xmath156 are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "in both cases the core radius of the sphere is 2 kpc .",
    "it is evident that such a theory can reproduce those essential properties of mond which so nicely embody the overall characteristics of galaxy rotation curves : no keplerian decline beyond the visible disk ; an extended flat rotation curve with the characteristic rotational velocity proportional to the one - fourth power of the galaxy mass ( the tully - fisher law ) ; a larger mass discrepancy in systems with lower surface density ; and a different overall form of rotation curves in high- and low - surface density systems .",
    "a difference with mond in its original form is an eventual keplerian decline in rotation velocity and , consequently , the presence of an upper limit to the mass discrepancy of @xmath158 , but this can be large .    clearly this is a cosmologically effective theory of mond ; that is , the form of rotation curves is determined by the effective potential eq .",

    "thus the friedmann equation for the expansion of the universe becomes @xmath170\\eqno(48)\\ ] ] where @xmath171 is the density parameter of radiation , and i have assumed that @xmath172 .",
    "the response time of the scalar field to the effective potential is comparable to the oscillation period at the bottom of the time - like potential well ; i.e. , for small oscillations , @xmath173 where @xmath174\\eqno(50)\\ ] ] then , from eq .  43 it follows that , @xmath175 for the parameters yielding the mond phenomenology , described above , ( @xmath176 , @xmath177 ) this is @xmath178 @xmath31 ( about @xmath179 years if @xmath180 ) . while the universe is younger than @xmath181 , the scalar field can not respond to the evolving effective potential .",
    "the scalar field @xmath24 will remain at its initial value until @xmath182 , will then seek the effective potential minimum and oscillate about that value .",
    "the oscillations would thus constitute dark matter , in the form of soft bosons , with a compton wavelength of about @xmath183 kpc .",
    "the evolution of a model universe with these properties has been followed by numerically integrating eqs .",
    "26 , 47 , and 48 . here",
    "i have set @xmath184 which requires @xmath185 to be consistent with the supposed mond phenomenology ( @xmath186 , @xmath147 ) . in integrating eqs .",
    "47 and 48 it is assumed that the scalar field oscillations remain coherent down to the present epoch .",
    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "3 - 5 . in fig .",
    "3 we see the early evolution of the scalar field @xmath24 as a function of scale factor @xmath29 .",
    "this illustrates the point made above : for @xmath187 , corresponding to an age of roughly @xmath188 @xmath31 , the response time of the scalar field to the effective potential becomes less than the age of the universe ; @xmath24 feels the potential and seeks its minimum .",
    "but it overshoots the equilibrium point and runs against the `` centrifugal '' barrier @xmath189 .",
    "the oscillations persist through the present epoch ; their contribution to the present density of the universe depends upon the amplitude which depends upon the initial value of the the scalar field @xmath24 .",
    "here it was necessary to set this at 1.2 @xmath190 ( planck mass ) to achieve @xmath191 .",
    "the time - dependent density parameters of radiation ( @xmath171 ) , baryons ( @xmath28 ) , the oscillating component of the scalar field ( @xmath192 ) and the smooth component of the scalar field ( @xmath193 ) are shown in fig .",
    "4 .    in this theory",
    "there is an evolving component of the vacuum energy ( quintessence ) equal roughly to the bare quadratic potential @xmath194 . with @xmath115 given by eq .",
    "43 and making use of eq .",
    "40 , we find that @xmath195 ; i.e. , the evolving component can not comprise a large fraction of the _ present _ total energy density and be consistent with mond .",
    "therefore , i have set the bare cosmological term @xmath196 to force the present composition of the universe to be that of the concordance model ( @xmath197 ) .    over the course of the evolution of the model universe , from @xmath198 to @xmath199 , the quantity @xmath200 changes from its initial assumed value of zero to @xmath201 .",
    "therefore the approximation @xmath202 in determination of @xmath40 ( eq .  26 ) appears to be justified .",
    "this also implies that the effective value of the constant of gravity @xmath59 has not varied by more than a 0.5% over the history of the universe , so there is no contradiction with the standard big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "however , because of the cosmic evolution of @xmath36 and @xmath40 , those aspects of galaxy kinematics related to mond , the acceleration parameter , @xmath203 , and the maximum mass discrepancy , @xmath135 , will evolve with cosmic time .",
    "this is shown in fig .  5 where we see these quantities as a function of scale factor .",
    "the change in the mond critical acceleration , @xmath203 , would be noticeable as an evolution of asymptotic rotation velocity and consequently of the tully - fisher relation for spiral galaxies .",
    "for example , at a redshift of @xmath204 , the acceleration parameter is roughly half its present value which implies that the asymptotic circular velocity corresponding to an object of a given mass would be only 85% of its present value .",
    "the compton wavelength of the bosonic dark matter , in units of the hubble length , is given by @xmath205 ( eq .  51 ) .",
    "taking @xmath206 this may be written @xmath207    the observations of the cmb anisotropies place an upper limit on @xmath208 because the scalar dark matter must form well before recombination ( @xmath209 ) . if the soft bosons are to cluster on at least the scale of the third peak in the cmb power spectrum , then @xmath210 kpc .",
    "the condition that the bosons not collect in galaxies places a lower limit on @xmath208 .",
    "the minimum clustering scale is the de broglie wavelength given by @xmath211 where v is the velocity dispersion of a bound object ( @xmath212 km / s for a massive galaxy ) . if , for example , @xmath213 kpc it must be the case that @xmath214 kpc .",
    "these two conditions take together restrict the range of @xmath51 ; from eq .",
    "52 we find @xmath215    if @xmath51 lies within these limits , then the bosons could collect in clusters of galaxies ( @xmath216 mpc ) while avoiding galaxies .",
    "this is a possible solution to the problem of the remaining mass discrepancy in clusters in the context of mond ( sanders 2003 ) .",
    "below we see that solar system phenomenology places an even more stringent upper limit on @xmath51 and hence , via inequality 53 , a lower limit on the maximum mass discrepancy @xmath137 .",
    "the solution of the bstv field equations about a galaxy - scale ( @xmath155 m@xmath156 ) , albeit spherical , mass distribution , as shown in fig .",
    "1 , implies that @xmath217 at the approximate position of the sun ( @xmath218 kpc ) , corresponding to a local discrepancy of @xmath219 . in other words , in the outer solar system there is a scalar field acceleration that is comparable to the newtonian acceleration .    in the inner solar system , the avoidance of locally detectable preferred frame effects limits the contribution of a scalar field to the total force ( sanders 1997 , in preparation 2005 ) ; specifically",
    ", the acceleration due to the scalar field gradient must be substantially smaller than the newtonian acceleration , i.e. , @xmath220 .",
    "moreover , within the orbit of neptune , planetary motion restricts the total weak field force , newtonian plus scalar , to be quite precisely inverse - square , such that any spatial variation of kepler s constant , @xmath221 , is less than several parts in about @xmath222 ( anderson et al .",
    "1995 ) . therefore",
    ", the substantial scalar field acceleration present in the galaxy at the radius where a test particle would begin to feel the acceleration of the sun ( about 1 pc ) must become significantly smaller than the newtonian force within the orbit of neptune .",
    "this provides , from the following argument , an upper limit on the scalar field coupling @xmath51 .    in the limit where @xmath121 the quasi - static field equation for q about a point mass ( eq .  41 )",
    "may be written @xmath223 defining @xmath224 and @xmath225 where @xmath226 ( @xmath227 is the schwarzschild radius and @xmath228 is the hubble radius ) and making use of eqs .",
    "38 and 40 , this may be rewritten as @xmath229 here for the final term i have assumed that @xmath230 ( @xmath231 ) which is generally the case within the galaxy .",
    ".  55 may be used to estimate the radius at which a massive object begins to affect the variation of @xmath24 . setting @xmath232 ( i.e. , @xmath233 ) we find a critical radius given by @xmath234",
    "this means that the anomalous force about the sun would increase as @xmath22 into @xmath235 within which the mass of the sun would affect the radial dependence of @xmath24 , leading to a non - inverse square force .",
    "the requirement that this deviation from @xmath22 be unnoticeable in the inner solar system places a lower limit on @xmath235 ( for example 1000 a.u . ) and therefore a revised upper limit on @xmath51 ; i.e. , @xmath236 .",
    "6 illustrates the numerical solution to the bstv field equations ( eqs .",
    "35 and 41 ) about a 1 @xmath237 object with @xmath238 ( @xmath239 ) at infinite radius ( the star is embedded in the galaxy ) .",
    "i have taken three different values of @xmath51 ( 2 , 3 , and 5 @xmath240 ) . in all cases",
    "@xmath241 . the dashed line on the log - log plot is the newtonian force and the long dashed , dotted and solid curves show , respectively , the anomalous scalar force for these three different assumed values of @xmath51 .",
    "we see that in all cases the anomalous force increases as @xmath22 into about 1000 a.u . and then becomes constant at a value between 4 and 100 @xmath242 cm / s@xmath243 depending upon the assumed value of @xmath51 .",
    "the scalar force remains constant until @xmath244 at which point the scalar force is given by @xmath245 ; i.e. , at smaller radii the force is again @xmath22 but a factor of @xmath246 below the newtonian force .",
    "this , in fact , is an additional motivation for the parameter @xmath113 as given in eq .",
    "it would appear that a constant force in the outer solar system is unavoidable in the context of this theory .",
    "this is interesting in view of the anomalous acceleration detected in the outer solar system by the pioneer spacecrafts the `` pioneer anomaly'' which is on the order of @xmath247 cm / s@xmath243 ( anderson et al . 1998 ) . if the predicted anomalous force is to be less than the pioneer anomaly , then @xmath248 .",
    "this upper limit , combined with the lower limit given by the condition that the soft bosons should not accumulate in galaxies , inequality  53 , places a limit upon the maximum discrepancy in the present universe ; i.e. , @xmath249 if @xmath250 .",
    "thus the predicted galaxy phenomenology approaches that of pure mond with a very large maximum discrepancy .    in this limiting case ,",
    "corresponding to @xmath251 , the response time of the scalar field would be about 160 years ; i.e. , scalar field oscillations would appear when the universe approximately 200 years old or at @xmath252 , well before decoupling .",
    "this would seem to guarantee that the soft bosons could cluster down to the scale of the third or fourth peak in the cmb angular power spectrum , although detailed calculations would be required to confirm consistency with the observed power spectrum .",
    "this limit would also assure that the bosons could penetrate to the cores of rich clusters of galaxies .    as in all scalar - tensor theories",
    "there is a predicted time variation of the baryonic mass unit or , equivalently , of the gravitational constant . in this case",
    ", it arises because the source term for the gravitational metric , @xmath17 , contains the expression @xmath253 .",
    "therefore , the cosmological variation of g would be given by @xmath254 given that the mond acceleration parameter @xmath255 and that @xmath256 , then with the above limit on @xmath51 this would imply that @xmath257 @xmath33 , well below the current limit imposed by lunar laser ranging ; i.e. , @xmath258 @xmath33 ( williams et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the near numerical coincidence between the mond acceleration parameter and @xmath9 suggests that the proper theory of mond should be an effective theory that mond phenomenology results only in a cosmological background .",
    "if so , then the goal is not to derive a relativistic theory which predicts , on the one hand , mond phenomenology about mass concentrations , and on the other hand , leads to a viable cosmology in a homogeneous universe .",
    "rather , the correct theory may well be one in which mond reflects the influence of cosmology on local particle dynamics and arises only in a cosmological setting .",
    "it goes without saying that this theory is not general relativity , because in the context of general relativity local particle dynamics is immune to the influence of cosmology .",
    "this may be demonstrated via the birkoff theorem ( will & nordtvedt 1972 ) , but ultimately comes down to the strict application of the equivalence principle ( the strong equivalence principle ) in gr which permits no environmental influence on local particle dynamics ( apart from tides ) .",
    "but , as was first fully appreciated by dicke ( 1962 ) , this does not apply to scalar - tensor theory where the cosmology - encoded scalar field , determined by the universal mass distribution and its time evolution , pervades every corner of the universe .",
    "this suggests that a cosmological basis for mond may be provided by scalar - tensor theory .",
    "however , as was also appreciated by dicke , if scalar - tensor theory is to satisfy the precise experimental constraints on the universality of free fall ( the weak equivalence principle ) , then it must couple to matter jointly with the einstein metric .",
    "the simplest such coupling , via a conformal transformation of the einstein metric , leads to the serious problem of gravitational lensing in the context of mond no enhanced deflection of photons due to the scalar field .",
    "this problem may be solved by postulating a non - conformal relation between the einstein and physical metrics involving a normalized dynamical vector field ( as in teves ) , but such a field may also produce unobserved effects of the preferred cosmological frame on local particle dynamics .",
    "the pcg field equation , or its weak coupling limit , provides a mechanism by which unwanted local dynamical effects of the scalar or vector fields may be suppressed in the limit of high field gradients ( e.g. , in the solar system ) where the proper theory of gravity is very nearly gr . in this context",
    "the outskirts of galaxies would be the transition region between a preferred frame tensor - vector - scalar cosmology and a gr - dominated local dynamics that is protected from cosmological influence .",
    "this transition would be observable as an acceleration dependent deviation from newtonian dynamics , or mond .",
    "i have shown here that a preferred frame generalization of pcg , i.e. a bi - scalar - tensor vector theory ( bstv ) , can be an effective theory of mond in the sense that it provides a cosmological realization of bekenstein s negative sextic potential in the context of static pcg . moreover , it is a cosmologically evolving effective potential , and the mond phenomenology can only result in the context of a frw cosmology .",
    "the theory is characterized by three parameters : in addition to the mass - squared of the bare potential , @xmath115 , and the coupling strength parameter , @xmath51 , it was necessary to add a third parameter , @xmath113 which permits a sensible value of @xmath28 in the presence of mond phenomenology ( eq .  44 ) , provides a return to @xmath22 attraction in the inner solar system ( fig .  6 ) , and tames the rapid evolution of @xmath59 ( eq .  58 ) .",
    "the evolving potential also provides a mechanism which , with the quadratic bare potential , inevitably produces cosmological cold dark matter in the form of scalar field oscillations .",
    "this unavoidable appearance of cosmological dark matter is a primary motivation for the theory .",
    "such dark matter appears to be required by a variety of considerations ranging from cmb anisotropies to the observed relative dimming and re - brightening of snia",
    ".    however , if the dark matter is not to accumulate in galaxies , then it must be seriously frustrated ; i.e. , the compton wavelength , extended by @xmath259 should be larger than the scale of galaxies .",
    "i have demonstrated that this implies a lower limit to the strength of the scalar field coupling to baryons ( eq .  53) a limit which also depends upon the maximum ratio of the scalar - to - newtonian forces ( the maximum discrepancy ) .",
    "there is also an upper limit on the coupling parameter required by the suppression of a non - inverse square anomalous force in the outer solar system that is to say , any non - inverse square force must be smaller than that implied by the pioneer anomaly or by planetary motion .",
    "however , in view of the pioneer anomaly , it is of interest that the theory requires , at some level , a constant anomalous acceleration in the outer solar system .",
    "i emphasize that the present theory is not an alternative to bekenstein s teves ; it is an example of a teves theory , but one which explicitly involves two scalar fields ; in bekenstein s theory , the second field is implicit ( or not explicitly dynamical ) .",
    "however , this bi - scalar - tensor - vector theory is incomplete .",
    "the complete covariant theory requires consideration of the full dynamics of the vector field , and , then , following bekenstein , an examination of the properties of wave propagation .",
    "there remains the danger of acausal propagation or instability of the background solution .",
    "i leave this for later consideration because , as is evident , the procedure followed in constructing this theory , and that of bekenstein , is different from what is usually done in relativity and cosmology . here , a theory is built up from the bottom by adding bits and pieces as required by phenomenology .",
    "this may seem unfamiliar or cumbersome because the usual methodology in this field is more deductive ; here the approach to the final theory is incremental .",
    "it may be that the basis of mond lies in another direction entirely as a modified non - local particle action ( milgrom 1994 ) .",
    "it may also be that the observational case for cdm has been overstated , as argued by mcgaugh ( 2004b ) .",
    "but the weight of present observational evidence implies that the final theory of mond should reproduce , or at least simulate , the effects of cdm upon cosmic expansion and upon cmb anisotropies .",
    "i am grateful to jacob bekenstein and moti milgrom for helpful criticisms and comments which had a major positive impact on this work .",
