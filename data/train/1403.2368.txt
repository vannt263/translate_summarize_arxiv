    "a study on quantum double - well ( dw ) systems coupled to harmonic oscillators ( hos ) has been made in many fields of physics and chemistry @xcite .",

    "however , one can not obtain exact eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the schrdinger equation even for quartic dw potential only ( without ho ) .",
