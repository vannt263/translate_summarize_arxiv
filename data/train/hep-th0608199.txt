    "in recent years the braneworld model has received renewed interest . by this scenario our world",
    "is represented by a sub - manifold , a three - brane , embedded in a higher dimensional spacetime ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "braneworlds naturally appear in the string / m theory context and provide a novel setting for discussing phenomenological and cosmological issues related to extra dimensions .",
    "the models introduced by randall and sundrum are particularly attractive @xcite .",
    "the corresponding spacetime contains two ( rsi ) , respectively one ( rsii ) , ricci - flat brane(s ) embedded on a five - dimensional anti - de sitter ( ads ) bulk .",
    "it is assumed that all matter fields are confined on the branes and only the gravity propagates in the five dimensional bulk .",
    "more recently , alternatives to confining particles on the brane have been investigated  and scenarios with additional bulk fields have been considered .",
    "although topological defects have been first analyzed in four - dimensional spacetime @xcite , they have been considered in the context of braneworld . in this scenario",
    "the defects live in a @xmath2dimensional submanifold embedded in a @xmath3dimensional universe .",
    "the domain wall case , with a single extra dimension , has been considered in @xcite .",
    "more recently the cosmic string case , with two additional extra dimensions , has been analyzed cohen , ruth .",
    "for the case with three extra dimensions , the t hooft - polyakov magnetic monopole has been numerically analyzed in roessl , cho . in refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite the corresponding analysis for the global monopole is presented . in particular ,",
    "in @xcite the authors have obtained the solution to the einstein equations considering a general @xmath4-dimensional minkowski brane worldsheet and a @xmath1-dimensional global monopole in the transverse extra dimensions with the core on the brane .",
    "the corresponding line element has the form @xmath5where @xmath6 is the minkowskian metric on the @xmath0-brane , @xmath7 with @xmath8 being the energy scale where the gauge symmetry of the global system is spontaneously broken , @xmath9 is the line element on a @xmath10-sphere with unit radius .    in braneworld models",
    "the investigation of quantum effects is of considerable phenomenological interest , both in particle physics and in cosmology .",
    "the analysis of quantum effects produced by a massless scalar field propagating in the bulk described by @xmath11 version of line - element ( [ g ] ) has been developed in @xcite ( for the investigation of the quantum vacuum effects in higher dimensional braneworld models with compact internal spaces see @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "continuing in this direction , our interest here is to investigate the quantum effects induced also by the conical structure of the brane .",
    "we will consider the cosmic string on the brane and the global monopole in transverse dimensions as idealized defects .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we evaluate the heat kernel for a massless scalar field . in section [ sec : integ ] we consider a special case where the angle deficit in the cosmic string subspace is an integer fraction of @xmath12 and evaluate the corresponding euclidean green function and the vacuum expectation values of the field square .",
    "the corresponding quantities for the general case of the angle deficit are evaluated in section [ sec : gencase ] .",
    "we also consider the vacuum expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor .",

    "the parameter @xmath19 is associated with the planar angle deficit and is related to the linear mass density of the string . in the special case @xmath20 , line element ( [ ds2comp ] ) reduces to the interval ( [ g ] ) with @xmath21 . in this section",
    "we evaluate the heat kernel associated with a massless scalar field in the spacetime defined by ( [ ds2comp ] ) admitting an arbitrary curvature coupling parameter @xmath22 .",
    "the corresponding euclidean green function obeys the second order differential equation @xmath23with @xmath24 being the covariant derivative operator and @xmath25 is the scalar curvature for the background spacetime .",
    "the most important special cases are minimally and conformally coupled scalar fields with @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively . for the geometry described by ( [ ds2comp ] ) one has @xmath28 for the points away from the string core . in order to evaluate the green function",
