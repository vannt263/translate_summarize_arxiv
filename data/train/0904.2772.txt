    "theoretical studies suggest that those bright x - ray sources are binary systems with a neutron star or black hole and are formed via tidal capture or exchange companions with encounters ( fabian et al .",
    "1975 ; hills 1976 ) . as for the low luminosity x - ray sources ( @xmath1 @xmath6 @xmath7 ergss@xmath4 )",
    ", the population was first investigated by hertz & grindlay ( 1983 ) .",
    "these dim sources consist of several types of x - ray binary systems .",
    "the brightest are quiescent low - mass x - ray binaries ( qlmxbs , an accreting neutron star or black hole with a companion star at a low accretion rate ) , and then cataclysmic variables ( cvs , an accreting white dwarf with a main - sequence or subgiant companion ) , followed by active binaries ( abs , two main - sequence / subgiant objects in a binary ) , and millisecond pulsars ( msps ) which are thought to be the descendants of the lmxbs with their luminosity similar to cvs . studying the population of x - ray sources in globular clusters can help us understand more about the physical properties of x - ray binaries and their formation mechanism , and construct the dynamical evolution scenario of globular clusters ( hut et al .",
    "1992 ) .    with the high resolution ( down to the scale of sub - arcsecond ) and better sensitivity of the _ chandra _  x - ray observatory and _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) , some faint x - ray sources , especially cvs and abs in globular clusters have been studied and identified , such as 47tuc ( grindlay et al .",

    "these sources can be formed by primordial binaries ( for the majority of active binaries and some cataclysmic variables ) or dynamical interactions ( for some cataclysmic variables ) .",
    "pooley & hut ( 2006 ) and bassa et al . ( 2008 ) report that the number of x - ray sources with luminosity @xmath9 ergss@xmath4 in the 0.5 - 6.0 kev range will scale with the encounter rate ( for the case of dynamical origin ) and the total mass ( for the case of primordial origin ) of globular clusters .",
    "m12 has a relatively low encounter rate and is less massive when compared with many of the globular clusters previously studied .",
    "m12 , as a low - density core globular cluster , is a good target to study the correlation between the number of x - ray sources and the encounter rate as well as the mass of globular clusters at the low core density end .",
    "based on previous studies of other globular clusters , more active binaries are identified in low - density core globular clusters than in dense - core globular clusters ( e.g. m4 ; bassa et al .",
    "so we could expect there will be more active binaries in m12 .",
    "furthermore , verbunt ( 2002 ) indicate that magnetically active binaries ( mainly rs cvn systems ) are more likely to be primordial in origin .",
    "hence , we could also expect that the number of x - ray sources has a stronger dependence on the total mass than on the encounter rate for the low - density core globular clusters .",
    "m12 is a relatively low - density core globular cluster with 0@xmath072 of core radius and 2@xmath016 of half - mass radius ( harris 1996 , version of 2003 february ) .",
    "it is near the galactic disk ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) so there are not so many ( foreground or background ) stars in the region as on the galactic disk .",

    "the reprocessing included flagging and filtering out the cosmic rays and creating a new bad pixel file by using ` acis\\_run\\_hotpix ` package .",
    "the data were also filtered with the ` asca ` ( advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics ) grades of 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 which is the standard value to optimize the instrumental signal - to - background ratio .",

    "periods of high background flares ( count rate @xmath24 5 counts s@xmath4 which is inspected from the entire area of chip s1 ) were eliminated .",

    "was corrected by -0@xmath2505 and -0@xmath2509 respectively and then corrected by the boresight correction ( see @xmath26 ) .",

    "the unabsorbed flux is derived assuming a power - law model with n@xmath12 = @xmath27 @xmath14 and a photon index of 2 .",
    "the sources listed in the upper part are those inside the half - mass radius and the lower ones are outside the half - mass radius of m12 .",
    "the ciao package ` wavdetect ` was employed to detect x - ray sources inside the acis - s3 chip .",
    "the wavelet scales ( also the sizes of the point spread function , psf ) were set to be a series from 1 to 16 increasing by a factor of @xmath28 .",
    "we also set the detection signal threshold to be @xmath29 such that there will be at most one false detection ( fake source ) caused by background fluctuation .",
    "the data was divided into three energy bands : soft band ( 0.3 - 1 kev ) , medium band ( 1 - 2 kev ) , and hard band ( 2 - 7 kev ) .",
    "we performed ` wavdetect ` with exposure maps on the total energy band ( 0.3 - 7 kev ) and also the three sub - bands with the parameters described above .",
    "we then produced a master source list which was the combined source list of the 4 energy bands .",
    "we detected 20 sources in the whole acis - s3 chip and 6 of them are inside the half - mass radius of m12 .",
    "figure 1 shows the resultant source detection on the chip .",
    "table 1 shows the information of the 20 sources ordered by increasing unabsorbed flux within 0.3 - 7 kev .",
    "the columns list the source name , the position of the source ( j2000.0 ) , the net counts ( source counts excluding the background contribution ) in the three bands ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 ) , and the unabsorbed flux within 0.3 - 7 kev and 0.5 - 2.5 kev .",
    "the photon counts from the three bands were extracted from the source region corresponding to the 3@xmath33 ` wavdetect ` ellipse .",
    "furthermore , the background counts were extracted from an annulus centered at the individual source and outside the 3@xmath33 ` wavdetect ` ellipse region .",
    "the unabsorbed flux was calculated from the source counts rate by assuming a power law model with a column density n@xmath12 = @xmath27 @xmath14 and a photon index of 2 .",
    "we also estimated the possible number of background sources .",
    "if we consider the 14 sources outside the cluster half - mass radius as background sources , then we can scale the background sources inside the half - mass radius by the area ratio .",
    "therefore , there will be 14 @xmath15 @xmath34r@xmath35 / ( @xmath34r@xmath36 - @xmath34r@xmath35 ) @xmath37 5 background sources inside the half - mass radius of m12 .",
    "this is consistent with the log n - log s relation derived from the _ chandra _  deep field survey ( giacconi et al .",
    "sources detected in this survey are active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and distant galaxies , and therefore we took them as background sources unrelated to the galactic globular cluster . based on the log n - log s relation and the detection limit of the observation , we expected 16 to 22 out of 20 within the acis - s3 chip and 3 to 5 out of 6 within the half - mass radius to be background ( agns ) contribution .",
    "for an expectation of 5 backgrounds and by a poisson distribution , the probability of detecting 6 or more backgrounds is roughly 38@xmath38 .",
    "if we use the completeness limit of the observation to estimate the backgrounds , we would have 3 to 4 backgrounds out of 6 sources inside the half - mass radius , which is consistent with the estimation using the detection limit . for the case of adopting completeness limit ,",
    "the poisson probability that all of the sources inside the half - mass radius are backgrounds is @xmath22 21@xmath38 , and the result does not change our conclusion .",
