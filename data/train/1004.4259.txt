    "in association with solar flares , we sometimes observe enhancements of visible continuum , in which case the event is termed a `` white - light flare . ''",
    "although white - light events had previously been mainly associated with energetic flares ( _ goes _ x - class ) , there are now reports of continuum emission from events as weak as c - class flares @xcite thanks to accurate photometry from space achieved by _ yohkoh _ , _ trace _ , and _ hinode _ , and by improved ground - based instruments .",
    "however , white - light flares are still very infrequently observed and some energetic events do not show any enhancement in white light . the processes causing it remain unclear @xcite .",
    "because there is a good correlation of light curves and sites of emission between optical continuum and hard x - rays ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there is some consensus that the origin of white - light emission lies in the energy in accelerated particles , especially non - thermal electrons .    using the thick - target model @xcite ,",
    "the energy in flare - accelerated electrons can be compared to the radiative losses in white light ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if flare - accelerated electrons indeed produce the white - light emission , the energy content in electrons must be larger than the radiative losses in white light .",
    "due to the ( inferred ) steep electron spectrum , the energy in electrons strongly depends on the cutoff of the electron spectrum at low energies . to match the energies , @xcite and @xcite estimated the cutoff energy of electrons at more than @xmath3 , whereas @xcite obtained values below @xmath4 from a statistical analysis of _ transition region and coronal explorer ( trace ) _ and _ reuven ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager ( rhessi ) _ observations",
    ". these differences might be due to the variation from flare to flare . in any case",
    ", a cutoff energy of @xmath5 can supply the white - light power , but not @xmath6 .    the solar optical telescope ( sot ) of _ hinode _ @xcite makes observations in white light .",
    "its broadband filter imager ( bfi ) take images in red ( @xmath7 , width @xmath8 ) , green ( @xmath9 , width @xmath8 ) and blue ( @xmath10 , width @xmath8 ) continuum ranges .",
    "radiation at these wavelengths comes from the photosphere and hence reflects the broadband continuum emission well .",
    "however , sot normally obtains only infrequent images in these filters .",
    "more frequently , sot takes images in the @xmath0-band ( @xmath11 , width @xmath12 ) , formed mainly from ch  line opacity .",
    "@xcite show contribution functions for these filters ; the @xmath0-band has a photospheric and an upper - photospheric contribution .",
    "it therefore serves well to define the morphology of white - light flares and it was also used in the _ yohkoh _ observations @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath0-band emission could contain not only continuum emission , but also ch  line emission . if the @xmath0-band emission contains line emission , the radiative losses estimated from the @xmath0-band emission assuming blackbody radiation is overestimates of the true losses .",
    "however , in this paper , we treat the @xmath0-band emission mainly came from the continuum emission , and we therefore use @xmath0-band images as a proxy for the white - light images .",
    "sot observed white - light emission from three x - class flares in 2006 december @xcite .",
    "@xmath0-band emission of the largest event ( x3.4 flare on 2006 december  13 ) is reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite concluded that the white - light emission could be produced by radiative back - warming resulting from particle - beam heating , and @xcite noted that the white - light emissions appeared at the sites of the largest inferred reconnection rates . in this paper , we describe the white - light observations of the 2006 december  14 flare that was also observed by the _",
    "rhessi _ @xcite .",
    "we obtain x - ray energy spectra for each foot - point separately , using _ rhessi _",
    "imaging spectroscopy , and compare the results with energy estimated from _ hinode _ @xmath0-band images ( section [ observation ] ) . in section [ relation ] , energy estimates are discussed for different cutoff energies .",
    "on 2006 december  14 , an x1.5-class flare occurred in active region noaa  10930 ; this region produced a total of three x - class flares in 2006 december .",
    "_ hinode_/sot took @xmath0-band images every 2 minutes , obtaining four images between 22:09 and 22:16ut that showed flare - related brightenings .",
    "the exposure times of these images were 0.031  s , and the spatial binning was 0.109  arcsec / pixel . to estimate the excess emission from these images",
    ", we made a reference image by averaging images before ( 22:07ut ) and after ( 22:17ut ) , and subtracted the reference from the flare images .",
    "we then calculated background pixel statistics for these difference images , and estimated the excess emission by summing the pixels at more than @xmath13 (= 245.3  dn / exposure time / pixel ) above the background level .",
    "_ rhessi _ had full coverage of this flare .",
    "figure  [ rhessi_lc ] shows light curves from _ goes _ x - rays , @xmath0-band emission by _",
    "hinode_/sot obtained as described above , and hard x - rays observed by _ rhessi_.",
    "the total white - light emission correlates well with hard x - rays at @xmath14 , as shown in the fourth panel of figure  [ rhessi_lc ] .",
    "note that the white - light images are brief samples , whereas the hard x - ray record is continuous .    around the times of the _ hinode _ images",
    ", we made _ rhessi _ hard x - ray images integrated over 1 minute by using the clean algorithm with sub - collimators 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 , and  9 . despite its lower energy resolution , sub - collimator 2",
    "is used here to obtain higher spatial resolution for images reconstructed over a broad energy range .",
    "sub - collimator 5 is affected by cumulative radiation damage and is therefore not used ( the observations presented here were taken before the first _ rhessi _",
    "it is necessary to register the _ rhessi _ and _ hinode _ images empirically . for this purpose we compared _ rhessi _ thermal x - ray images at 6 kev with images from _ hinode_/xrt and shifted the latter to fit .",
    "the alignment between sot/@xmath0-band and xrt was corrected using the method of @xcite .",
    "the results for this registration are shown in the top figures of figure  [ gb_rhessi_1]-[gb_rhessi_4 ] . above 40 kev ,",
    "the hard x - ray images show two foot - point sources , with the @xmath0-band emission at the same locations within uncertainties .",
    "the hard x - ray footpoint regions have different spectral behavior ; the @xmath15 energy range shows the northwest ( nw ) source more clearly than the southeast ( se ) one .",
    "the behavior in white light is opposite to this , i.e. , the se region is brighter . on the other hand , if we use @xmath14 hard x - rays ,",
    "a similar feature of the white - light emission was obtained .",
    "this se feature was seen clearly in all four images at @xmath14 .",
    "we derived energy spectra of each footpoint separately by obtaining images at different energy bands ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for the first time interval , the spectrum for both footpoints could be derived showing similar power - law spectra ( figure  [ gb_rhessi_1 ] ) . for the later time intervals ,",
    "the nw footpoint is too weak to accurately determine its spectrum , and only the spectrum of the se footpoint is derived ( figures  [ gb_rhessi_1]-[gb_rhessi_4 ] ) .",
    "in this section , the power of the white - light continuum ( radiative losses ) is compared with the energy deposition by flare - accelerated electrons producing the hard x - ray emission .",
    "the white - light power is calculated assuming that the @xmath0-band enhancements are continuum emission from a blackbody .",
    "this is a strong assumption that is not necessarily fulfilled .",
    "besides the continuum emission , the @xmath0-band emission could contain line emission . in this case",
    ", our assumption leads to an overestimation of the white - light power .",
    "a further limitation of our assumption is that the spectrum of the white - light flare emission could be different from a blackbody .",
    "we further assume temperatures of @xmath16 for the quiet sun , @xmath17 for the penumbral regions , and @xmath18 for the umbra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and calculate the temperature of the white - light flare source using the response of the @xmath0-band filter and planck s law ( @xmath19 ) . the power of the white - light continuum @xmath20 ( i.e. , radiative losses ) from the temperature @xmath21 is then calculated using stefan - boltzmann s law ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "note that this represents a lower limit because the continuum could extend into the uv , e.g. via the balmer continuum ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the total power in non thermal electrons @xmath23 above a given cutoff energy @xmath24 in the thick - target approximation ( equation  ( [ eq1 ] ) ; * ? ?",
    "* ) can be derived from the observed hard x - ray photon spectrum @xmath25 ( as shown in figures  [ gb_rhessi_1]-[gb_rhessi_4 ] ) : @xmath26 the factor @xmath27 is an auxiliary function from @xcite as calculated by @xcite for a relevant range of spectral indices @xmath28 as @xmath29 .",
    "two approaches to derive @xmath23 are presented : first , @xmath23 is estimated from the total flare spectrum integrated over 4 seconds around the time of the @xmath0-band image ( figure  [ rhessi_4sec ] ) .",
    "second , @xmath23 is estimated for each footpoint source separately using imaging spectroscopy ( figures  [ gb_rhessi_1]-[gb_rhessi_4 ] and [ cutoff_ene ] ) .",
    "the advantage of the first approach is that it provides smaller uncertainties and that the _ rhessi _ images are taken almost simultaneously with the @xmath0-band images ( cf .",
    "figure  [ rhessi_lc ] ) .",
    "the second approach compares individual sources , but a time integration of 60 seconds is needed to obtain a significant result .",
    "however , both approaches give similar results ( figures  [ rhessi_4sec ] and [ cutoff_ene ] ) .",
    "error bars are estimated from the uncertainties of the fit parameters .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath30 ( typically @xmath15% for the spatially integrated spectra , and 10% for imaging spectroscopy @xcite ) dominates the error budget .",
    "there is a clear correlation between the power in white - light emissions and the energy deposition rate by non - thermal electrons for all cutoff energies . for low cutoff energies ,",
    "the power provided by non - thermal electrons is well above the white - light power ( e.g. @xmath150% of the power in electrons above @xmath31 is enough to account for the white - light emission ) .",
    "the total power of electrons above @xmath32 roughly matches the white - light power .",
    "if the @xmath0-band emission contains not only continuum emission but also line emission , the values for the white - light power derived above are overestimates . in any case , for all realistic cutoff energies , the energy in non thermal electrons ( derived from thick - target assumptions ) is larger than the white - light power , and independent of values of the cutoff energies , the derived powers are correlated .",
    "the observations discussed in this paper show that the solar flare white - light emission is closely related in time , space , and power to the acceleration of non - thermal electrons . to explain the observed correlation between white light and high energy hard x - ray emission in the simplest possible way , the two components should originate in the same source region .",
    "continuum emission in the @xmath0-band emission comes from @xmath33 above the photosphere ( see figure  1 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and hard x - ray emission in @xmath34 originates in the chromosphere .",
    "observationally , the emission site of @xmath34 hard x - rays is estimated at @xmath35 height above the photosphere from ( early ) _ yohkoh _ observations @xcite and around @xmath36 height by _ rhessi _ for a single event @xcite .",
    "this information is weak and we would like to see systematic _ rhessi _ data analyses on this point , but the existing data suggest a difference of more than @xmath37 between the emission sites @xcite . theoretically , a @xmath34 electron should thermalize some @xmath38 height above the photosphere ; at this mid - chromospheric height , the density is about @xmath39 @xcite . at these energies , however , the electrons can not penetrate into the lower chromosphere , and thus they do not heat the photosphere .",
    "electron energies more than @xmath40 are necessary for penetration to the photosphere , even if the flare site has become ionized @xcite .",
    "however , the energy in @xmath40 electrons is far too small ( by about 4 orders of magnitude , assuming the power law seen at @xmath2 can be extrapolated to @xmath40 ) to produce the white - light emission .",
    "the data presented here therefore call attention to the need for a white - light emission model which can explain the good correlation with high - energy electron emission and difference of the emission height of white light and hard x - rays .",
    "non thermal ionization levels enhance the continuum @xcite and also make back - warming possible ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
