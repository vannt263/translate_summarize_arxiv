    "swift j1753.5 - 0127 was discovered with swift / bat on 2005 may 30 ( palmer et al . 2005 ) .",
    "spectral and timing analysis performed with swift / xrt and rxte / pca ( morris et al .  2005 , morgan et al .",
    "2005 ) revealed a hard power - law spectrum and a 0.6 hz qpo that might indicate the presence of a black hole in the system .",
    "the source was also detected in the radio band with merlin at a flux density of 2.1 mjy at 1.7 ghz ( fender et al .",
    "2005 ) , probably indicating jet activity .    after reaching a flux peak of 120 mcrab on 2005 july 1 ( morgan et al .",
    "2005 ) , the source flux began to decay , but has stalled for months in its decline at a level of @xmath020 mcrab ( 2 - 20 kev ) .",
    "this is an unusual behaviour for a black hole transient , but even more unusual is the slow rebrightening , which occurred between 2006 june and 2007 july - august , as can be seen in the swift / bat light curve in figure [ fig ] ( panel a ) . at present",
    ", the x - ray light curve of swift j1753.5 - 0127 suggests a slow decay .",
    "the source never left the low / hard state ( ls ) during the whole outburst ( cadolle bel et al .",

    "c    miller et al .",
    "2006a , analysing xmm - newton observations collected during 2006 march , estimated a disk component extending to the innermost stable orbit at + @xmath1 .",
    "this is one of only three black hole candidates ( bhcs ) that show a thermal component in ls at a very low x - ray luminosity , since they are usually found not to have such a component ( esin et al .",
    "1997 , fender , belloni & gallo 2004 ; but see exceptions : miller et al .",

    "2007 for xte j1817 - 330 ) .",
    "cadolle - bel et al .",
    "2007 analysing radio vla observations , reported an average flux of 0.7 @xmath2 0.1 mjy at 8.5 ghz , when the unabsorbed x - ray flux was @xmath3 ( 2 - 11 kev ) . with these values",
    "the source is extremely radio fainter than expected from the empirical correlation found by gallo et al .",
    "2006 between the radio and the x - ray luminosity ( scaled to a distance of 1 kpc ) of a number of bhcs in ls and in quiescence : @xmath4 .",
    "we are currently observing the source with several instruments in different bands of the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "* x - ray - rxte@xmath5swift : * we started monitoring the source weekly on 2007 may 6th with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ satellite ( @xmath03 - 100 kev , pca+hexte ) and we are currently observing it . the vertical dashed - dotted line in figure [ fig ] ( panel a ) indicates the beginning of the rxte observing campaign .",
    "swift / xrt ( @xmath00.5 - 10 kev ) pointed at the source 9 times between 2007 may 28th and 2007 july 15th , with a typical exposure of @xmath02 ksec .    * radio - wsrt : * we observed the source in radio 4 times with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope on 2007 july 1st , 2007 july 8th , 2007 july 15th and 2007 july 22nd , at 5 and 8 ghz .",
    "rxte and swift observed the source simultaneously during the first three radio pointings , only rxte observed the last one .",
    "* optical / ir - smarts : * the smarts telescope observed the source 47 times between 2007 july 9th and 2007 september 30th , in the i , v and h band .",
    "the usual exposures were 15 min , enough to get a typical signal to noise ratio higher than 50 .",
    "here we present preliminary results from our multiwavelength analysis , focusing on the two issues pointed out at the end of section  [ par : intro ]    figure [ fig ] ( panel b ) shows a swift / xrt energy spectrum taken on 2007 july 03 .",
    "fitting the spectrum with an absorbed power law we obtain a fit with a reduced chi squared @xmath6 = 1.55 ( fixing the galactic absorption @xmath7 to the value found by miller et al .",
    "2006a , @xmath8 @xmath9 ) .",
    "the residuals can be significantly reduced by the addition of a thermal component with @xmath10 kev ( significance 4.2 @xmath11 ) : the new fit gives a chi squared @xmath6 = 1.23 .",
    "this three - component model gives an absorbed flux of @xmath12 ( 0.5 - 10 kev ) : this corresponds to @xmath13 .",
    "the normalization gives an inner radius @xmath14 = 72@xmath15 km .",
    "in all our spectral fits ( but one that gave not consistent results ) we found a temperature for the thermal component consistent with @xmath16 kev and an inner disc radius @xmath14 in the range ( @xmath17 ) km .",
    "spectra have been fitted fixing the galactic absorption @xmath7 to the value found by miller et al .",
    "figure [ fig ] ( panel c ) shows simultaneous x - ray / radio flux densities for a number of bhcs ( scaled to a distance of 1 kpc ) used by gallo et al .",
    "2006 to find the empirical correlation between the radio and the x - ray luminosity mentioned in ",
    "[ par : intro ] we measured swift j1753.5 - 0127 x - ray and radio flux on 2007 july 08 : in radio , with wsrt , we did not detect the source but we could give a 3 @xmath11 upper limit on its flux of 1.1 mjy / beam . with swift",
    "/ xrt we measured a x - ray flux ( 2 - 11 kev ) of @xmath18 ( 26 mcrab ) .",
    "we added two points to the plot , a black and a white square , for a source distance of 1 kpc and 8.5 kpc respectively .      _",
    "( i ) _ in all our spectral fits ( but one ) we found results partially consistent with miller et al .",
    "2006a : a thermal component with a temperature consistent with the one found by miller et al .",
    "2006a ( @xmath19 kev ) is needed .",
    "the inner radius of the disc blackbody associated with the thermal component is higher than the radius found by miller et al .",
    "2006a ( @xmath14 = @xmath20 km ) and not consistent with it ( only in one case it is consistent within the errors ) .",
    "a broad band spectral analysis is clearly needed to model swift j1753.5 - 0127 emission , putting light on the origin of the thermal emission .    _",
    "( ii ) _ figure [ fig ] clearly shows that the source is still less luminous in radio than expected from the @xmath21 correlation , as previously reported by cadolle bel et al .",
    "this might weaken the identification of swift j1753.5 - 0127 as a bhc , not supported by any dynamical measurement of the mass of the compact object : nss are usually much radio fainter than bhcs at the same x - ray luminosity ( fender & hendry 2000 ) .",
    "however note that other ls sources are also `` partially radio quenched '' ( e.g. xte j1720 - 318 , igr j17497 - 2821 , xte j1650 - 500 , 1e 1740.7 - 2942 , grs 1758 - 258 ; gallo 2007 ) .",
