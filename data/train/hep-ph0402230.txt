    "the charmonium production has long been considered as a good process for investigating both perturbative and nonperturbative properties of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , because of the relatively large difference between the scale at which the charm - quark pair is produced at the parton level and the scale at which it evolves into a quarkonium . in particular , comparing to hadron colliders , @xmath8 colliders , provide a cleaner environment to study the charmonium productions and decays . however , some puzzles arise from the recent measurements on the prompt @xmath9 productions at babar and belle  @xcite . for the inclusive @xmath9 productions ,",
    "the cross section is much larger than the predictions of nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics ( nrqcd )  @xcite ; there is also an over - abundance of the four - charm - quark processes including the exclusive @xmath9 and charmonium productions ; there is no apparent signal in the hard @xmath9 spectrum which has been predicted by the @xmath10 production mode as well as the color - octet mechanism in nrqcd . to provide plausible solutions and explanations for these conflicts ,",
    "theorists have studied the possibilities of the contribution from two - virtual - photon mediate processes  @xcite , large higher - order qcd corrections  @xcite , collinear suppression at the end - point region of the @xmath9 momentum  @xcite , contribution from the @xmath9-glueball associated production  @xcite and contribution from a very light scalar boson @xcite .",
    "although all of the above corrections significantly enhance the cross sections for the prompt @xmath9 productions , they can be well distinguished by their momentum and angular distributions .",
    "the two - virtual - photon processes have a very hard spectrum for the @xmath9 momentum and an enhancement in the large @xmath11 region ( @xmath12 is the @xmath9 scattering angle in the center - of - mass frame ) due to the @xmath13-channel electron - exchange contribution  @xcite .",
    "the collinear suppression softens the hard spectrum of the color - octet production  @xcite as well as that of the color - singlet @xmath14 process  @xcite , while the high - order qcd corrections are generally expected not to change the angular distribution strongly and their effect could be represented by a large renormalization @xmath15 factor  @xcite .",
    "@xmath9-glueball associated production in @xmath0 annihilation has been shown to be of a special interest recently  @xcite . as a basic prediction of qcd",

    "the quarkonium - glueball associated productions at b factories should be another good place to discover glueballs because their amplitudes are essentially the same as those of the quarkonium decays .",

    "conservatively , the present belle data  @xcite suggest that @xmath23 should be negative .",
    "this unexpected angular distribution leads us to consider further the possibility of the scalar charmonium @xmath29 and glueball @xmath27 mixing . in this letter",
