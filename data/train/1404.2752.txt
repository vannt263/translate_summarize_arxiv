    "the theory of _ extended formulations _ is a fast developing research field that has connections to many other fields of mathematics . in its core",
    ", it deals with the concept of representing polytopes ( usually having many facets or even no known linear description ) as linear projections of other polytopes ( which , preferably , permit smaller linear descriptions ) .",
    "thus , polyhedral theory plays a crucial role for extended formulations establishing a natural connection to geometry .",
    "recall that a _ polytope _ is the convex hull of a finite set of points and that every polytope can be described as the solution set of a system of finitely many linear inequalities and equations .",
    "the _ size _ of a polytope is the number of its facets , i.e. , the minimum number of inequalities in a linear description of the polytope . an alternative way to represent a polytope is to write it as a projection of another polytope .",
    "concretely , a polytope  @xmath3 is called an _ extension _ of a polytope  @xmath4 if the orthogonal projection of @xmath5 on the first @xmath6 coordinates equals @xmath7 .",
    "the _ extension complexity _ of a polytope  @xmath8 is the minimum size of any extension for @xmath8 . here , we restrict extensions to be polytopes , not polyhedra , as well as projections to be orthogonal , not general affine maps . this definition simplifies the representation , however does not lead to loss of generality .    as an illustration ,",
    "regular hexagons ( having six facets ) can be written as a projection of triangular prisms ( having only five facets ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : example ] .",
    "it is easy to argue that such extensions are indeed of minimum size .",
    "another textbook example is the @xmath9-dimensional _ cross polytope _ ,",
    "which is the convex hull of all unit vectors @xmath10 and their negatives @xmath11 for @xmath12 .",
    "while the @xmath9-dimensional cross polytope has @xmath13 facets , it can be written as the projection onto the @xmath14-coordinates of the polytope @xmath15 which is a @xmath16-simplex ( and hence has only @xmath17 facets ) and can also be proven to be of minimum size .",
    "note that both examples admit minimum size extensions whose vertices are again projected to vertices .",

    "see , for instance , extended formulations for the parity polytope  @xcite , the permutahedron ( as a projection of the birkhoff - polytope ) , the cardinality indicating polytope  @xcite , orbitopes @xcite , or spanning tree polytopes of planar graphs  @xcite .",
    "although there are not many polytopes whose extension complexity is known exactly , most of the mentioned extensions have minimum size at least up to a constant factor .",
    "moreover , for many of these extensions there is even a one - to - one correspondence between the vertices of the extension and the vertices of the target polytope .",
    "clearly , a general extension might have vertices that are not projected onto vertices . here",
    ", let us call such vertices to be _ hidden vertices_. the following natural question arises : given a polytope @xmath8 , can we always find a minimum size extension @xmath5 of @xmath7 that has no hidden vertices ?    in this paper , we negatively answer the above question .",
    "namely , we prove that for almost all heptagons , every minimal extension has at least one hidden vertex .",
    "later we extend this result and construct a family of @xmath37-polytopes , @xmath38 , such that at least @xmath2 of all vertices in any minimum size extension are hidden .",
    "thus , in this paper we show that there are polytopes for which the minimum size of an extension without hidden vertices is strictly bigger than their extension complexity .",
    "consider the open question : how big can be the difference between the minimum size of extensions without hidden vertices and the extension complexity ?",
    "this paper demonstrates that the difference can be at least one in the context of the above question .",
    "however , the above question remains open and as the next step to study hidden vertices we propose the following question : is there a polynomial @xmath39 such that for every polytope the minimum size of its extension without hidden vertices is at most @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the extension complexity of the polytope ?",
    "in this section , we consider convex polygons with seven vertices taken in general position . for such polygons ,",
    "we prove that there is no extension of minimum size such that every vertex of the extension is projected onto a vertex of the polygon .",
    "let us briefly recall known facts about extensions of heptagons . in 2013 , shitov @xcite showed that the extension complexity of any convex heptagon is at most @xmath42 .",
    "further , it is easy to see that any affine image of a polyhedron with only @xmath43 facets has at most @xmath42 vertices .",
    "thus , one obtains :    [ thm : extension_complexity_heptagon ] the extension complexity of any convex heptagon is @xmath42 .    while shitov s proof is purely algebraic , independently , padrol and pfeifle @xcite established a geometric proof of this fact .",
    "in fact , they showed that any convex heptagon can be written as the projection of a @xmath44-dimensional polytope with @xmath42 facets . in order to get an idea of such a polytope ,",
    "let us consider the following construction ( which is a dual interpretation of the ideas of padrol and pfeifle ) :    let @xmath7 be a convex heptagon with vertices @xmath45 in cyclic order . for @xmath46 let us set @xmath47 .",
    "further , choose some numbers @xmath48 such that @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are contained in one hyperplane and consider @xmath53 .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that ( by possibly shifting the vertices labels ) one may assume that the convex hull of @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 forms a facet @xmath57 of @xmath58 .",
    "in this case , remove the defining inequality of @xmath57 from an irredundant outer description of @xmath58 and obtain a @xmath44-dimensional polytope @xmath59 with only @xmath42 facets whose projection is still @xmath7 . for an illustration ,",
    "[ fig : extension_heptagon ] .",
    "note that removing the facet @xmath57 results in an additional vertex that projects into the interior of @xmath7 .    in what follows , our argumentation does not rely on the construction described above but only on the statement of theorem [ thm : extension_complexity_heptagon ] .",
    "however , the previous paragraph gives an intuition why additional vertices may help in order to reduce the number of facets of an extension .",
