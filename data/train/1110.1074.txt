    "a useful probe of the properties of various field theories that has received increased interest in recent times is the entanglement entropy , with applications being pursued in diverse areas such as condensed matter physics , quantum information , and quantum gravity .",
    "one of the main motivators , in the context of strongly coupled field theories ( perhaps modeling novel new phases of matter ) , is that the entanglement entropy may well act as a diagnostic of important phenomena such as phase transitions , in cases where traditional order parameters may not be available .    within a system of interest , consider a region or subsystem and call it @xmath0 , with the remaining part of the system denoted by @xmath1 .",
    "a definition of the entanglement entropy of @xmath0 with @xmath1 is given by : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the reduced density matrix of @xmath0 given by tracing over the degrees of freedom of @xmath1 , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the density matrix of the system .",
    "when the system is in a pure state , _",
    "@xmath6 , the entanglement entropy is a measure of the entanglement between the degrees of freedom in @xmath0 with those in  @xmath1 .",
    "it is of interest to find ways of computing the entanglement entropy in various strongly coupled systems , in diverse dimensions , and under a variety of perturbations , such as the switching on of external fields , or deformations by relevant operators .",
    "a powerful tool for studying such strongly coupled situations is gauge / gravity duality , which emerged from studies in string theory and m - theory .",
    "the best understood examples are the conjectured ads / cft correspondence and its numerous deformations @xcite ( see _ e.g. , _",
    "ref.@xcite for an early , but still very useful , review . )",
    "there has been a great deal of activity for over a decade now , applying these tools to strongly coupled situations of potential interest in condensed matter and nuclear physics , for example .",
    "fortunately , there has been an elegant proposal@xcite for how to compute the entanglement entropy in systems with an einstein gravity dual ( or , more generally , a string or m  theory dual in the large @xmath7 limit and large t hooft limit ) , which provides a new way to calculate the entanglement entropy using geometrical techniques ( for a review see ref.@xcite ) . in an asymptotically anti",
    " de sitter ( ads ) geometry , consider a slice at constant ads radial coordinate @xmath8 .",
    "recall that this defines the dual field theory ( with one dimension fewer ) as essentially residing on that slice in the presence of a uv cutoff set by the position of the slice . sending the slice to the ads boundary at infinity",
    "removes the cutoff ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) . on our @xmath9 slice ,",
    "consider a region @xmath0 .",
    "now find the minimal  area surface @xmath10 bounded by the perimeter of @xmath0 and that extends into the bulk of the geometry .",
    "( figure  [ fig : setup_shapes ] shows examples of the arrangement we will consider in this paper . ) then the entanglement entropy of region @xmath0 with @xmath1 is given by : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is newton s constant in the dual gravity theory .",
    "this prescription for the entropy coincides nicely with various low dimensional computations of the entanglement entropy , and has a natural generalization to higher dimensional theories .",
    "note that there is no formal derivation of the prescription .",
    "steps have been made , such as in refs .",
    "@xcite , but they are not complete . however , there is a lot of evidence for the proposal .",
    "a review of several of the issues can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "further progress has been made recently in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in this paper we shall assume that this holographic prescription does give the correct result for the entanglement entropy in systems with gravity duals , and proceed to examine the interesting question of how the entanglement entropy behaves when a system is perturbed by an operator that triggers a renormalization group ( rg ) flow .",
    "for simplicity , we will work with flows that connects two conformal field theories , and we will consider ( for concreteness ) a four dimensional example and one in three dimensions .",
    "such examples are extremely natural to study using holographic duality since ( at large @xmath7 ) it is possible to find geometries that represent the full flow from the maximally supersymmetric theory to theories with fewer super symmetries .",
    "( this was first proposed in refs.@xcite , and several examples have since been found . )",
    "flow between field theory fixed points correspond to flows between fixed points of the supergravity scalar potential .",
    "the examples we will study begin with the four dimensional case of the flow@xcite to the leigh ",
    "strassler point@xcite , which results from giving a mass to one of the @xmath13 chiral multiplets that make up the @xmath14 yang mills gauge multiplet .",
    "we then continue with the three dimensional generalization of it discussed in ref .",
    "the gravity dual of the four dimensional flow connects ads@xmath15 at the @xmath16 extreme of a radial coordinate @xmath17 to ads@xmath18 at @xmath19 , where the space @xmath20 results from squashing the @xmath21 along the flow .",
    "there are two of the 42 supergravity scalars switched on at the latter endpoint , and correspondingly the characteristic radius of the ads@xmath22 in the ir is larger than that of the uv theory : the gravity dual for the three dimensional flow has related structures , this time connecting an ads@xmath23 uv geometry to an ads@xmath24 in the ir , where @xmath25 results from squashing the @xmath26 along the flow .    before studying the specific examples , however , we step back and try to anticipate some of the key physics that we should expect from the entanglement entropy in this type of situation , more generally . generically , holographic rg flow involves a flow from one dual geometry in the uv to another in the ir , separated by an interpolating region that can be thought of as a domain wall separating the two regions .",
    "the key to understanding the behaviour of the content of the holographic entanglement entropy formula is to then understand how the computation incorporates the structure of the domain wall , and how the field theory quantities it extracts are encoded . to anticipate how to mine this information",
    ", we do an analytic computation of the proposed entanglement entropy  ( [ eq : holographic_entanglement ] ) in an idealized geometry given by a sharp domain wall separating two ads regions with different values for the cosmological constant . working in various dimensions ( ads@xmath22 , ads@xmath27 , and ads@xmath28 , pertaining to flows in four , three , and two dimensional field theories )",
    ", we find a fascinating and satisfying structure , seeing how the entanglement entropy tracks the change in degrees of freedom under the flow , and several other features .",
    "we expect that these features will be present in a wide range of examples , and we confirm our results in the examples mentioned above .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section  2",
    "we carry out the study of the entanglement entropy in the presence of the idealized ( _ i.e. , _ sharp domain wall ) holographic rg flow model , and discover how the physics is organized in the results .",
    "then , ready to study examples , we review the four dimensional leigh  strassler rg flow of interest , and its dual ads@xmath22 flow geometry in section  3 .",
    "we explicitly solve ( numerically ) the non  linear equations that define the geometry and scalars in the interpolating dual supergravity flow .",
    "we then compute the entanglement entropy and extract the physics , comparing to our predictions from section  2 .",
    "section  4 presents the analogous studies for the three dimensional field theory , with the ads@xmath27 dual flow geometry .",
    "we end with a discussion in section 5 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the generic holographic rg flow involves a flow from one dual geometry in the uv to another in the ir , separated by an interpotating domain wall . in all examples ,",
    "understanding the behaviour of holographic entanglement entropy , as proposed in equation  ( [ eq : holographic_entanglement ] ) , requires us to understand how the area formula incorporates the structure of the domain wall in terms of field theory quantities .",
    "so we start by doing an analytic computation in an idealized geometry given by a sharp domain wall in ads . in general , the location of the wall , and its thickness , are determined by field theory parameters corresponding to the details of the relevant operator - for example , in the case of the leigh  strassler flow and its generalization we later study , the detail in question is the bare value of the mass given to the chiral multiplet .",
    "a sharp domain wall is of course not a supergravity solution , and falls somewhat outside the usual supergravity duality to any ( large  @xmath7 ) theory , but nevertheless is a clean place to start to capture how the physics is organized .",
    "we expect it to capture a great deal of the key physics of holographic rg flow , as regards how the entanglement entropy formula works .",
    "we use the following background metric : @xmath29 with @xmath30 here @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is either four , three , or two coordinates ( the spatial coordinates of the dual field theory ) , depending upon whether we are in ads@xmath22 , ads@xmath27 , or ads@xmath28 , the cases we will consider .",
    "also , @xmath33 .",
    "the length scale of ads on either aide of the wall is set by @xmath34 in the uv at @xmath35 and @xmath36 in the ir at @xmath37 .",
    "we begin by studying a region @xmath0 in the three spatial dimensions which is a round ball of radius @xmath38 . using a radial coordinate @xmath5 in the spatial dimensions , the area of the surface , @xmath39 , that extends into the bulk",
    "is given by : @xmath40 where the function @xmath41 defines the enbedding .",
    "we can calculate the equations of motion that result from minimizing this `` action , '' and we find that the solution is given by : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the position of the domain wall in the ads radial direction , and @xmath44 is the spatial radial position where @xmath45 and is given by : @xmath46 note that , rather than integrating out to @xmath16 , we integrate out to large positive radius @xmath47 , defining our uv cutoff , with small @xmath48 defined by : @xmath49 note that with the solution given for @xmath50 , we are assuming that @xmath38 is larger than a critical radius @xmath51 such that our surface extends past the doman wall into the second ads region .",
    "the critical radius @xmath51 is given by setting @xmath52 in the above : @xmath53 substituting the solution back into equation ( [ eqt : area ] ) , we can analytically calculate the area of our minimal surface , @xmath54 , and hence the entanglement entropy _ via _ equation  ( [ eq : holographic_entanglement ] ) .",
    "this gives a long expression that we will not display here .",
    "for our purposes it is enough to first expand the area for small @xmath48 : @xmath55 + \\frac{r_{\\rm uv}^3 } { 4}\\left[1 - 2   \\ln(2)\\right ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & & - \\frac{1}{2 } e^{2 \\frac{r_{dw}}{r_{\\rm uv } } } r_{\\rm uv } \\ell \\sqrt { \\ell^2 - r_{\\rm uv}^2 e^{-2 \\frac{r_{dw}}{r_{\\rm uv } } } } + \\frac{1}{2 } r_{\\rm uv}^3 \\tanh^{-1 } \\left ( \\frac{\\sqrt { \\ell^2 - r_{\\rm uv}^2 e^{-2 \\frac{r_{dw}}{r_{\\rm uv}}}}}{\\ell } \\right )   \\nonumber \\\\   & & + \\frac{r_{\\rm ir}}{2 } e^{2 \\frac{r_{dw}}{r_{\\rm ir } } } \\sqrt { \\ell^2 - r_{\\rm uv}^2 e^{-2 \\frac{r_{dw}}{r_{\\rm uv } } } } \\sqrt {   \\ell^2   + r_{\\rm ir}^2 e^{-2 \\frac{r_{dw}}{r_{\\rm ir } } } - r_{\\rm uv}^2 e^{-2 \\frac{r_{dw}}{r_{\\rm uv } } }   } \\nonumber   \\\\ & & - \\frac{r_{\\rm ir}^3}{2 } \\tanh^{-1 } \\left ( \\sqrt { \\frac{\\ell^2 - r_{\\rm uv}^2 e^{-2 \\frac{r_{dw}}{r_{\\rm uv } } } } { \\ell^2   + r_{\\rm ir}^2 e^{-2 \\frac{r_{dw}}{r_{\\rm ir } } } - r_{\\rm uv}^2 e^{-2 \\frac{r_{dw}}{r_{\\rm uv } } } } } \\right)+o(\\epsilon)\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we find it useful to rewite it in a suggestive way : @xmath56 + \\frac{r_{\\rm uv}^3 } { 4}\\left[1 - 2   \\ln(2)\\right ]   \\nonumber   \\\\ & & - \\frac{1}{2 } e^{2 \\frac{r_{dw}}{r_{\\rm uv } } } r_{\\rm uv } \\ell \\sqrt { \\ell^2 - \\tilde{\\ell}_{cr}^2 } + \\frac{1}{2 } r_{\\rm uv}^3 \\tanh^{-1 } \\left ( \\frac{\\sqrt { \\ell^2- \\tilde{\\ell}_{cr}^2}}{\\ell } \\right )   \\nonumber \\\\   & & + \\frac{r_{\\rm ir}}{2 } e^{2 \\frac{r_{dw}}{r_{\\rm ir } } } \\sqrt { \\ell^2 - \\tilde{\\ell}_{cr}^2 } \\sqrt {   \\ell^2 - \\tilde{\\ell}_{cr}^2 + r_{\\rm ir}^2 e^{-2 \\frac{r_{dw}}{r_{\\rm ir } } } }    \\nonumber   \\\\ & & - \\frac{r_{\\rm ir}^3}{2 } \\tanh^{-1 } \\left ( \\sqrt { \\frac{\\ell^2 - \\tilde{\\ell}_{cr}^2 } { \\ell^2   - \\tilde{\\ell}_{cr}^2 + r_{\\rm ir}^2 e^{-2 \\frac{r_{dw}}{r_{\\rm ir } } } } }   \\right ) + o(\\epsilon)\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 there are a number of notable features of this expression .",
    "first , we see the results from pure ads@xmath22 in the first line . there , we see the usual uv divergent terms and the @xmath38independent constant that results from the fact that the ball preserves some of the conformal invariance of ads@xmath22 .",
    "second , the terms that have @xmath36 as coefficients ( the last two lines ) always have @xmath58 appearing in the combination : @xmath59 we are tempted to interpret this @xmath60 as the effective ball radius as seen in the ir , as opposed to the simple @xmath38 seen in the uv .",
    "furthermore , the combination : @xmath61 appears in a manner analogous to how the uv cut - off @xmath48 appears .",
    "( this might not be clear in our @xmath48 expansion of the above equation .",
    "one way to see that it does appear as @xmath48 does is to look at equation ( [ eqt : r_rho ] ) ) .",
    "now @xmath62 is not necessarily small , but we will see that it is useful to think of it as the cut  off in the ir theory . with these observations in mind , we rewrite the last three lines of equation ( [ eqt : test1 ] ) as follows : @xmath63 let us focus on the terms proportional to @xmath64 . if we expand these terms assuming that @xmath65 , _",
    "i.e. , _ the effective length in the putative ir theory is larger than the ir cutoff , which also means that the length is such that the surface extends very far past the wall into the ir ads space , we get : @xmath66 + \\frac{r_{\\rm ir}^3}{4 } \\left [ 1 - 2\\ln(2 ) \\right ] + o(\\tilde{\\epsilon}/\\tilde{\\ell})\\ .\\ ] ] pleasingly , this is exactly the result we would have obtained if we were purely in the ir theory !",
    "so far therefore , we have seen how the entanglement entropy formula encodes key behaviours of both the uv and the ir theories , in terms of the appropriate scales , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the boundary of ads@xmath22 at @xmath16 is the uv region and the quantities of the uv theory appear accordingly . from the point of view of the ir theory , the domain wall acts ( for @xmath69 small ) as the effective uv region , with @xmath69 acting as the effective regulator .",
    "we are left with understanding the first two terms in equation  ( [ eqt : threelines ] ) .",
    "these two terms mix the properties of the uv and the ir regions , and are more subtle .",
    "we associate them with the region around the domain wall , which connects the uv and ir regions ( through and abrupt change in our idealized example ) .",
    "it is prudent to try to understand the role of these terms toward the end of the flow , and so we do a large @xmath38 expansion of them , giving : @xmath70 + \\frac{r_{\\rm uv}^3}{4 }   \\left[1    + 2   \\ln(2 ) \\right ] + o(1 / \\ell)\\ .\\ ] ] so we see that these terms give contributions very analogous to our uv and ir results , where here the reference scale is played by @xmath71 .",
    "( note that the constant term is actually different than the uv and ir constant terms form . ) at fixed @xmath48 or @xmath72 , we may think of this as a new set of divergences .",
    "now that we have an understanding of the contributions of the various pieces to the area , we combine everything together again and consider the large @xmath38 ( and small @xmath48 ) expansion : @xmath73 + \\frac{\\ell^2}{2 } \\left ( \\frac{r_{\\rm ir}^3}{\\tilde{\\epsilon}^2 } - \\frac{r_{\\rm uv}^3}{\\tilde{\\ell}_{cr}^2 }   \\right ) + \\frac{r_{\\rm uv}^3}{2 } \\ln \\left ( \\frac { \\ell}{\\tilde{\\ell}_{cr } } \\right ) - \\frac{r_{\\rm ir}^3}{2 } \\ln \\left ( \\frac { \\ell}{\\tilde{\\epsilon } } \\right )   \\nonumber \\\\ & &   + \\frac{r_{\\rm uv}^3}{2 } + \\frac{r_{\\rm ir}^3}{4 } - \\frac{1}{2 } r_{\\rm ir}^3 \\frac{\\tilde{\\ell}_{cr}^2}{\\tilde{\\epsilon}^2 }    - \\frac{1}{2 }   r_{\\rm ir}^3",

    "\\label{eqt : finalexpand5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first key result here is that we no longer have a @xmath74 scaling associated with the uv theory .",
    "the remaining @xmath74 dependence has a coefficient that is only associated with the ir theory and that is independent of the domain wall . in a non  rg flow scenario , the coefficient of such a term",
    "is determined by the central charge of the theory ( see _ e.g. , _",
    "refs.@xcite ) , but here we see that the coefficient has shifted from its uv value ( associated with the uv central charge ) to its ir value ( associated with the ir central charge ) .",
    "the second thing to note is that the area law associated with the uv cut  off ( the first @xmath58 term ) is joined by a second area law .",
    "its coefficient is sourced by the details of the domain wall .",
    "for clarity , we display this term here : @xmath75 we expect this new area law to be a robust feature of rg flow geometries , but anticipate that the coefficient s precise form will be different as we move away from the thin wall limit we are in here .",
    "the above result predicts that the coefficient grows more positive as @xmath43 is pushed to the uv . in realistic rg flows , while the domain wall position and sharpness can not be varied arbitrarily , it is expected to get thinner toward the uv and so at least in that regime we should recover positivity . finally , the constant terms in the last line of equation  ( [ eqt : finalexpand5 ] ) are a mixture of both the uv , ir , and domain wall physics .",
    "we can repeat the same procedure for ads@xmath27 , pertaining to rg flows in @xmath76 dimensional theories . as our system",
    "@xmath77 we consider a circular disc of radius @xmath38 .",
    "the solution for the surface embedding are exactly as in equation ( [ eqt : r_rho ] ) .",
    "we can calculate the minimal area and expand for small @xmath48 to get : @xmath78 we see the reappearance of many of the key players that we saw in the ads@xmath22 case , such as @xmath79 , @xmath71 and @xmath62 , appearing in similar types of term . for @xmath80",
    ", we recover the pure uv result ( proportional to @xmath81 ) and also the constant @xmath82 , the constant ensured by the fact that the disc preserves some conformal invariance , as expected . for large @xmath38 , we have : @xmath83 so in the ads@xmath27 case , the constant term shifts from its uv result to its ir result @xmath84 .",
    "again , in addition to the usual uv area law ( proportional to @xmath81 ) , we have a new area law controlled by the domain wall : @xmath85 which should be compared to the example from ads@xmath22 in equation  ( [ eqt : new_area_law ] ) .",
    "the same comments we made for the new area law there apply here : it is not necessarily positive , but we expect it to get more positive as the domain wall is sent to the uv , where generically it gets thinner .",
    "next we consider the case of ads@xmath28 , pertaining to flows in @xmath86 dimensions .",
    "we use a spatial interval of length @xmath87 for our region @xmath77 .",
    "the area is given by : @xmath88 in the large @xmath38 limit , this gives @xmath89 where @xmath71 and @xmath62 are defined in equations ( [ eqt : tildeellcr ] ) and ( [ eqt : tildeell ] ) respectively .",
    "so again we see that the universal coefficient ( in front of the natural logarithm ) becomes the ir factor in the large @xmath38 limit .",
    "the ir cutoff replaces the uv cutoff just as observed before .",
    "we next consider an area @xmath90 that is a strip in ads@xmath27 , to compare our results for the disc .",
    "we take the strip to be of finite width @xmath38 in the @xmath91 direction , and of length @xmath92 in the remaining direction , which will be taken to be large , making an infinite strip .",
    "the area is given by : @xmath93 since there is no explicit dependence on @xmath91 , there is a constant of motion in the dynamical problem associated to minimizing the area .",
    "however , we must be careful since the constant of motion on either side of the domain wall is not the same : @xmath94 on the ir side , the constant is simply given by @xmath95 , which occurs at a radial position we will denote as @xmath96 .",
    "the constant on the uv side is determined by asking that @xmath95 when @xmath97 , which is the critical situation before our embedding enters the ir ads .",
    "we can in turn calculate the area and length in terms of  @xmath96 and expand for small @xmath48 : @xmath98 @xmath99 here , we see the appearance of the gauss hypergeometric function:@xmath100 the large @xmath38 limit corresponds to taking @xmath101 , which gives us : @xmath102 so we see that that the constant term here is exactly the new area law s coefficient that we saw in the disc case , in equation  ( [ eqt : newarealaw4 ] ) . again , far enough in the uv , for large enough mass , our analysis suggests that this coefficient is positive .",
    "returning to ads@xmath22 , we consider for region @xmath90 a box in ads@xmath22 , in order to compare to the round ball we studied before . here",
    "the finite width is again @xmath38 and the two other sides are of length  @xmath92 , which we again take to be large .",
    "the computation proceeds in a similar way .",
    "the area gives : @xmath103 and taking the @xmath104 limit gives : @xmath105 again , we have that the constant term has the same coefficient as the new area law term for the ball case , as seen in equation  ( [ eqt : new_area_law ] ) .",
    "in field theory terms , the rg flow is defined by an @xmath106 supersymmetric deformation of the @xmath107 supersymmetric yang mills theory given by introducing a mass term for one of the chiral multiplets.this relevant deformation causes the @xmath108 theory to flow to an @xmath106 fixed point in the ir called the leigh  strassler fixed point  @xcite . for the @xmath109 theory at large @xmath7",

    "we define a function @xmath203 as follows : @xmath204 where @xmath205 and is a constant which we found from fitting to the data . using this function",
    ", we write the entanglement entropy as : @xmath206 where @xmath207 now asymptotes to zero .",
    "we show this in figure [ fig : adjusted_strip ] .",
    "a nice feature of the function @xmath203 is that it captures the ir / uv domain wall physics in terms of a single length scale which naturally normalizes the new uv divergence .",
    "this length scale emerges naturally from our holographic calculation , and it would be difficult ( yet worthwhile ) to independently calculate it in the dual field theory .",
    "furthermore the non  uv divergent parts of the entropy now asymptotes to zero for large @xmath38 , as appropriate for the entanglement entropy for the box region in this limit since there will only be the region @xmath77 remaining .",
    "the metric we need is given by : @xmath208 we consider a three dimensional ball with radius @xmath38 , so take as coordinates and ansatz for our surface embedding : @xmath209 the area of the surface is then given by : @xmath210 since there is an explicit @xmath17 dependence , there is no conserved quantity ( as was the case for the strip ) , so the extremal area must be found by solving the equations of motion derived from the above action : @xmath211 with the boundary conditions : @xmath212 in order to study the uv divergences of equation ( [ eqt : ball_area ] ) , it is convenient to define a new coordinate : @xmath213 the reason for this particular choice is that , in the pure ads geometry , the embedding @xmath214 has a solution given by @xmath215 . in terms of @xmath216 ,",
    "the embedding has asymptotic solution given by : @xmath217 where @xmath218 is a constant chosen such that the solution satisfies @xmath219 .",
    "let us define as before a quantity @xmath191 as follows : @xmath220 our numerical results for @xmath191 are shown in figure [ fig : eesphere ] . as expected from our sharp domain wall analysis , the asymptotic behavior is dominated by an @xmath58 behavior . furthermore , upon subtraction of this behavior , we find our expected @xmath74 behavior ( see figure [ fig : adjusted_ball ] ) .",
    "in fact , the large @xmath38 behavior of the adjusted entanglement entropy is very well approximated by the expression : @xmath221 comparing to equation ( [ eqt : finalexpand5 ] ) , the coefficients @xmath222 and @xmath223 should be interpreted as being a complicated function of the domain wall data ( and hence the mass term ) , whereas the coefficient @xmath224 should simply be related to the central charge of the ir theory .",
    "we show the dependence of @xmath222 , @xmath224 , and @xmath223 on the mass in figure [ fig : ball_mass_fit ] .    .",

    "blue solid curve is for @xmath225 , green dot  dashed curve is for @xmath226 , and red dashed curve is for @xmath227.,width=288 ]    first , we see that the coefficient of the area term @xmath222 decreases with increasing mass , which deviates from our domain wall analysis .",
    "however , our mass range displayed here is actually in the same region where the analogous results for the box were decreasing .",
    "this is all traceable ( as it was then ) to being far from the thin domain wall regime .",
    "in fact it is apparent that our results are just about to turn around , as happened for the box .",
    "we may ask whether we can capture the behavior of this coefficient with a function @xmath203 , defined in a similar way to that which we did for the box ( see equation  ( [ eqn : define_omega ] ) and discussion below it ) .",
    "this turns out to be the case , and we compare the function @xmath203 for the strip and for the ball in figure [ fig : omega_strip_vs_ball ] ( where we again let the data determine the value @xmath228 ) and we find that the results are remarkably close , suggesting that indeed this is a physical length scale in the theory . since the only other scale in the theory is the multiplet mass , we expect that @xmath203 is set by the inverse of the value of this mass after it has renormalized under rg flow to its value set by the scale at the domain wall .     for the strip and the ball .",
    "blue crosses are the ball results and the red squares are the strip results.,width=288 ]    finally , it is interesting to check whether the coefficient of the @xmath74 term of the entanglement entropy indeed matches our expectation that for large enough @xmath38 it should be equal to @xmath229 ( compare the definition of @xmath191 in equation  ( [ eqn : shift_def_s ] ) , and @xmath224 in equation  ( [ eqt : fit_ball ] ) and  ( [ eqt : finalexpand5 ] ) ) .",
    "we present this check in figure  [ fig : r_ir ] .",
    "indeed , we find that our results are very close to the expected value , and in fact the results get better with larger mass .",
    "it is not entirely unexpected that the results deviate somewhat for smaller mass . with smaller masses",
    ", one needs to go to larger @xmath38 ( and larger ads radial position ) to enter the ir ads , and larger @xmath38 is increasingly hard to explore numerically .     for large @xmath38 .",

    "we consider the 2 + 1 flow of ref .",
    "it is the analogue of the leigh  strassler flow we studied earlier .",
    "the ir fixed point is the @xmath231 fixed point studied in @xcite . starting with an ansatz for the metric of the form : @xmath232 the flow equations are given by than the authors of ref .",
    "the reason for this is such that the asymptotic behavior in terms of the coordinate @xmath17 are the same for our previous analysis . ] : @xmath233 to study the uv asymptotics , we define a coordinate @xmath139 via : @xmath234 and find that the fields have the following asymptotics : @xmath235 in the ir , we define a coordinate @xmath146 _ via _ : @xmath236 where @xmath237 .",
    "the asymptotics of the field is given by : @xmath238 note that this gives that @xmath239 .",
    "we follow a similar analysis as before for calculating the entanglement entropy and in light of our detailed calculations presented for ads@xmath22 , we will be brief here . for the strip , we define a quantity @xmath191 _ via _ : @xmath240 and we plot the result in figure [ fig:4dstrip ] . similarly for the disc ( of radius @xmath38 ) , we define @xmath191 via : @xmath241 and we plot the result in figure [ fig:4ddisc ] . as expected , there is no new divergent term , and the entanglement entropy has a non  zero coefficient associated with the area of the boundary for large @xmath38 .",
    "furthermore , fitting the large @xmath38 behavior for the disc result to the functional form @xmath242 gives a result for @xmath224 of approximately @xmath243 which is close to the value of @xmath244 , the value we would have predicted in the ir ads from the thin domain wall analysis ( see equation  ( [ final_expand_4_disc ] ) and discussion below it ) . using the strip data , we calculate the dependence of the coefficient on the mass and present it in figure [ fig:4d_drop ] .",
    "we find that the dependence is linear in the mass range explored .",
    "the linear behavior again suggests that we can interpret the coefficient in terms of the mass of the multiplet .",
    "the slope is negative .",
    "we expect that we are somewhat away from the mass regime where we connect with the thin domain wall analysis for physics controlled by the domain wall region .",
    "the regime of larger mass ought to show that the coefficient increases towards positivity ( see equations  ( [ eqt : newarealaw4 ] ) and  ( [ eqt : newarealaw4_b ] ) ) .",
    "it is currently too difficult to extract reliable numerical results in that regime however , and so we can not test this as we did for the case of one dimension higher .     for large @xmath38 .",
    "the blue circles are the numerical results , while the red dashed curve is the linear best fit.,width=288 ]",
    "we were able to uncover how the holographic entanglement entropy formula encodes a number of field theory features along an rg flow using the key feature of an holographic rg flow , its domain wall . in the thin wall limit where we study an idealized flow between two ads regions ( and hence a flow between fixed point theories )",
    "we were able to extract , in various dimensions , rather pleasing formulae showing how the field theory data appear separated out according to the various natural scales in the problem .",
    "using two known rg flows between fixed points , we were able to test our formulae in real examples and found that where we could , several of the features we expected to be robust were confirmed .",
    "this included the form of the growth of the entropy upon approach to the ir , which we found defined a new area law supplementing the ones known for the uv behaviour .",
    "we were also able to see ( in the thin domain wall limit ) how the entropy naturally encodes ( in its asymptotics ) the ( renormalized ) length scale corresponding to the presence of the relevant operator that was switched on .",
    "our overall goal is to understand the entanglement entropy in this holographic setting well enough to use it as another diagnostic tool for studying the properties of strongly coupled field theories , and so we consider this study of rg flow to be a useful step along the way .",
    "having analytically characterized , as we have done , the kinds of behaviour that can appear ( in various dimensions ) , we expect that holographic studies of the entanglement entropy in more complicated theories will be aided by our results .",
    "many such examples will , by their very nature , be only accessible with numerical approaches , and so analyzing of the results for the entropy may be subtle .",
    "this is where we expect a lot of the intuition here to help bring things sharply into focus , since such features as the entropy s approach to the end of the flow have now been unpacked in terms of the general features of holographic flow geometries .",
