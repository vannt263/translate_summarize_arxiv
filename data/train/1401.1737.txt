    "atomic nuclei are among the most fascinating quantum many - body systems that depict a rich variety of shapes and structures @xcite . most of the nuclei are known to have axially - symmetric , dominantly quadrupole , deformed shape in the ground - state . however , there are also regions in the nuclear periodic table , referred to as transitional regions , where axial - symmetry is broken and a triaxial mean - field description is appropriate to characterize the properties of these nuclei @xcite . for nuclei depicting triaxial shapes , there is a long - standing issue whether these nuclei have rigid or soft @xmath1-deformation ( see , for example , discussions in refs .",
    "@xcite ) . traditionally , there are two extreme phenomenological models that describe the triaxiality : the one with a rigid-@xmath1 deformation of davydov and flippov ( df ) @xcite and the @xmath1-soft model of wilets and jean @xcite .",
    "both models give rise to similar level energies and @xmath5 transition strengths for the ground - state bands and , therefore , it is impossible to delineate the two different modes of excitations .",
    "in fact , there have been suggestions @xcite that the two descriptions are equivalent and intrinsic single - particle wave functions obtained from a triaxially - deformed well are useful in describing low - lying collective states .",
    "however , it has been demonstrated @xcite that the phase of the odd - even staggering ( i.e. the staggering of the odd- and even - spin levels ) of the observed @xmath1-bands could shed light on the nature of the triaxial shape with rigid-@xmath1 rotation exhibiting an opposite staggering pattern to that of the @xmath1-soft case .",
    "recently , using the experimental techniques of above - barrier coulomb excitation and inelastic scattering , @xmath1-band energies of @xmath0ge have been extended considerably @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the odd - even staggering of the @xmath1-band is quite opposite to that of all neighboring nuclei and is in conformity with that expected for a rigid-@xmath1 deformation @xcite .",
    "this is one of rare examples of atomic nuclei exhibiting rigid-@xmath1 deformation in the low - lying states .",
    "the observed yrast- and excited states have been discussed @xcite using the df model and also the spherical shell model ( ssm ) approaches . in the ssm approach @xcite ,",
    "the pairing plus quadrupole - quadrupole interaction was employed in the @xmath6 configuration space , and it has been demonstrated that ssm provides a very good description of the observed data for the low - lying states in @xmath0ge .    the purpose of the present work is to investigate the high - spin properties of @xmath0ge using the multi - quasiparticle ( qp ) triaxial projected shell model ( tpsm ) approach @xcite . in the ssm analysis ,",
    "the primary emphasis was on the low - lying states and the present investigation complements the results obtained by the ssm approach .",
    "in tpsm , apart from 0-qp , 2- and 4-qp configurations are explicitly included in the basis space .",
    "therefore , in this model it is possible to investigate the high - spin band - structures , which provides important information on the interplay between collective and single - particle excitations , and thus to probe single - particle structures in the neutron - rich mass region . in the present study",
    ", we have also performed a detailed study of the neighboring nuclei to investigate the nature of @xmath1-deformation in these nuclei in comparison to @xmath0ge .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we provide a few details of the tpsm model for completeness and further details can be found in our earlier publications @xcite .",
    "section iii is completely devoted to the investigation of @xmath0ge and in section iv , the results of the neighboring ge- and se - isotopes are presented and discussed .",
    "finally , in section v , we provide a summary of the work performed in the present manuscript .",
    "in tpsm , triaxially - deformed nilsson states are employed as a starting basis to describe a nucleus exhibiting axial and triaxial deformations .",
    "an explicit three - dimensional angular - momentum projection is then performed for configurations built from the deformed nilsson states .",
    "a triaxial qp configuration is an admixture of different @xmath7 ( projection along the symmetry axis ) states , and the vacuum configuration is composed of @xmath8 states for an even - even system .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the angular - momentum projection from the @xmath9 , 2 , and 4 states correspond to the ground , @xmath1- and @xmath3- bands , respectively .",
    "the model has recently been extended @xcite to include multi - qp configurations in the model space , which allows one to describe states of collective @xmath1-vibrations and qp excitations on an equal footing .",
    "for instance , the multi - qp tpsm approach has been used to investigate the interplay between the vibrational and the quasi - particle excitation modes in @xmath10er @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated that a low - lying @xmath11 bands observed in these nuclei , the nature of which had remained unresolved , are built on triaxially - deformed 2-qp states .",
    "this band is observed to interact with the @xmath1-vibrational band and becomes favored at high angular - momentum for some er - nuclei . in another study @xcite , the long - standing puzzle of the very different @xmath12 decay rates from the same 2-quasineutron @xmath13 isomers in the @xmath14 isotones was investigated .",
    "it was shown that the highly @xmath7-forbidden transition from the @xmath15 isomer to the ground - state band is sensitive to the mixing with the @xmath15 state of the @xmath1-vibrational band .",
    "for even - even systems , the tpsm basis are composed of 0-qp ( qp vacuum ) , 2-proton , 2-neutron , and 4-qp configurations , i.e. , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the three - dimensional angular - momentum - projection operator @xcite and @xmath18 in ( [ basis ] ) represents the triaxial qp vacuum state .",
    "the qp basis chosen in ( [ basis ] ) is adequate to describe high - spin states up to @xmath19 for even - even systems . in the present analysis",
    "we shall , therefore , restrict our discussion to this spin regime .",
    "it is noted that for the case of axial symmetry , the qp vacuum state has @xmath9 @xcite , whereas in the present case of triaxial deformation , the vacuum state is a superposition of all possible @xmath7-values .",
    "rotational bands with the triaxial basis states , eq .",
    "( [ basis ] ) , are obtained by specifying different values for the @xmath7-quantum number in the angular - momentum projection operator @xcite .",
    ".the axial deformation parameter , @xmath20 , and triaxial deformation parameter , @xmath21 , employed in the calculation for @xmath22ge and @xmath23se .",
    "the @xmath1 deformation is related to the above two parameters through @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath20 is related to the @xmath25 deformation through @xmath26 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ linkingbe2 ]    in table [ linkingbe2 ] , we present the calculated inter - band b(e2 ) values that link the @xmath1 band to the ground band .",
    "an early example of a similar tpsm calculation can be found in ref .",
    "we give all the possible linking transitions for the low - lying states in @xmath0ge , together with those for @xmath27se as an illustrative example .",
    "it will be quite interesting to compare these values with the results from other models , for instance , the o(6 ) limit of the interacting boson model @xcite .    finally , in figs .",
    "[ fig13 ] and [ fig14 ] , experimentally - known angular - momenta are displayed as functions of transition energy @xmath28 for @xmath29ge and @xmath30se , which are compared with the present tpsm results and the corresponding ssm ones @xcite .",
    "it is clearly seen that both theoretical calculations describe the known data very well .",
    "nevertheless , it is observed , as in the case of @xmath0ge , discussed earlier that roughly above @xmath31 , the tpsm and ssm results deviate from each other for higher spin states .",
    "the predicted ssm values show pronounced zigzag pattern in the curves while the tpsm results appear more smoother .",
    "to summarize , the recently reported experimental measurement for @xmath0ge @xcite suggested that this nucleus may be a rare example of a nucleus exhibiting a rigid @xmath1 deformation in its low - lying states .",
    "our microscopic calculations using the multi - quasiparticle triaxial projected shell model support this inference . by studying various physical quantities",
    ", it is shown that in order to describe the data accurately for both the yrast and @xmath1-vibrational bands in @xmath0ge , a fixed triaxial deformation parameter @xmath2 is required for the tpsm calculation , which is consistent with that of the df model @xcite .",
    "the tpsm results are discussed closely with the experimental observations and also compared with the previous spherical shell model calculations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , experimental identification of the @xmath3- band , predicted in the present work for this @xmath1-rigid nucleus , would be very interesting .    to further demonstrate that the tpsm model with the same parameters as those of @xmath0ge is also applicable to the neighboring nuclei ,",
    "we have made a systematic investigation for @xmath29ge and @xmath30se , and discussed the results .",
    "it has been demonstrated that configuration mixing of various quasiparticle states can result in a dynamical change for a nucleus from being a @xmath1-rigid like to a @xmath1-soft type when interpreted in terms of the two phenomenological models of @xmath1-rigid of davydov and flippov and @xmath1-soft of wilets and jean .",
    "the odd - even staggering phase of the @xmath1-band is quite opposite in these two models and has been proposed to be an indicator of the nature of the @xmath1-deformation .",
    "what we have shown using the microscopic tpsm model is that the configuration mixing can lead to a transition from @xmath1-rigid to @xmath1-soft phases , at least , for nuclei studied in the present work .",
    "it remains to be explored whether similar observation is valid for other regions as well .",
    "the @xmath0ge nucleus belongs to the group of a few candidates where neutrinoless double-@xmath25 decay may be observed . in this context , we note that the recent beyond - mean - field calculations of nuclear matrix elements for neutrinoless double-@xmath25 decay , based on the energy density functional method using the gogny d1s functional , assumed axial symmetry for the @xmath0ge shape @xcite . as the nuclear matrix elements serve an important link between @xmath25-decay observations and the neutrino mass @xcite , it remains to be demonstrated what modifications triaxial mean - field deformation will make in the evaluation of the nuclear matrix - elements .",
