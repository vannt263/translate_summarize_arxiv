    "[ cor : smoothbn2 ] follows directly from the proof of theorem  [ thm : smoothbn2 ] . from the proof of theorem  [ thm :",
    "smoothbn2 ] , we can represent @xmath39 with the kirby diagram in figure  [ f : kirbythmb13 ] , where we can see the @xmath41 .",
    "if we rationally blow up this @xmath0 , then we obtain the kirby diagram in figure  [ f : kirbythmb12 ] , which by a sequence of kirby moves gets us back to the diagram in figure  [ f : kirbythmb5 ] , which is precisely @xmath99 .",
    "the embeddings of the @xmath0s in theorems  [ thm : smoothbn1 ] and [ thm : smoothbn2 ] are inherently different from the embeddings of @xmath100 , as discussed in the beginning of section  [ sec : smoothemb ] .",
    "as seen from corollaries  [ cor : smoothbn1 ] and [ cor : smoothbn2 ] , the embeddings of @xmath101 are such that if one rationally blows up those @xmath0s and then performs the regular blow - down @xmath68 times , then one gets back the manifolds @xmath102 respectively .",
    "one could also do these two steps in reverse : if one starts with @xmath102 , blows them up @xmath68 times and then rationally blows down the obtained @xmath5 configuration , then one again obtains the manifolds @xmath102 respectively .",
    "this is summarized in the following diagrams for the embeddings of @xmath38 for @xmath6 and for @xmath41 for odd @xmath2 respectively :        this is not the case with the embeddings of @xmath100 , since the rational blow - ups of those @xmath0 s result in @xmath105 ( and not @xmath106 ) and so blowing down @xmath68 times yields the manifold @xmath61 and not @xmath60 , the manifold we started with .    as a result",
    ", one can call an embedding of @xmath45  simple \" if rationally blowing up and then blowing down @xmath68 times yields back the same 4-manifold @xmath32 ( the top and right arrows of the diagram below ) .",
    "equivalently , an embedding @xmath45 is  simple \" if blowing up @xmath68 times followed by rationally blowing down the @xmath5 , yields back the same 4-manifold @xmath32 ( the left and bottom arrows of the diagram below ) .",
    "it follows that the embeddings of of @xmath38 for @xmath6 and for @xmath41 for odd @xmath2",

    "therefore , one can ask the following question : are there obstructions to embedding the @xmath0s in a  non - simple \" way ?",
    "nevertheless , theorem  [ thm : smoothbn2 ] prevents one from finding an upper bound on @xmath29 for a smooth @xmath1-manifold @xmath32 to contain an embedded @xmath0 .",
    "however , one can ask whether such a bound exists for  non - simple \" embeddings of @xmath45 .",
    "the kirby diagrams in the proofs of theorems  [ thm : smoothbn1 ] and [ thm : smoothbn2 ] strongly suggest that the key to determining whether an embedding of a rational homology ball @xmath0 is  simple \" lies in analyzing how the extra sphere with self - intersection @xmath3 intersects with the spheres of the @xmath5 configuration after one rationally blows up the @xmath0 .",
    "for example , if one starts with @xmath38 for @xmath6 , and rationally blows it up , one obtains the kirby diagram seen in figure  [ f : kirbythma4 ] . in this case , the extra sphere with self - intersection @xmath3 intersects with the last sphere of self - intersection @xmath26 ( @xmath17 in figure  [ f : kirbycncircles1 ] ) in the @xmath5 configuration . likewise ,",
    "if one starts with @xmath41 for odd @xmath2 , and rationally blows it up , one obtains the kirby diagram seen in figure  [ f : kirbythmb5 ] . in this case , the extra sphere with self - intersection @xmath3 intersects with the first sphere of self - intersection @xmath26 ( @xmath108 in figure  [ f : kirbycncircles1 ] ) in the @xmath5 configuration . in the  non - simple \" embedding case of @xmath100 , if one rationally blows up those rational homology balls , then the extra sphere of self - intersection @xmath3 intersects with the first and last spheres of the @xmath5 configuration ( @xmath109 and @xmath17 , respectively , in figure  [ f : kirbycncircles1 ] ) , as seen in figure  [ f : fishfiber ] .    in those instances where an exotic smooth manifold @xmath33 is obtained after rationally blowing down @xmath32 ( with @xmath0 ) ,",
    "then the embedding @xmath110 must be  non - simple \" .",
    "moreover , the intersection patterns of certain spheres of self - intersection @xmath3 with the @xmath5 configuration back up in @xmath32 , may be directly related to the obtained exotic smooth structure of @xmath33 .",
    "consequently , understanding the precise way of how the rational homology balls embed in @xmath1-manifolds , may give us a better understanding of exotic smooth structures of @xmath1-manifolds which were obtained as a result of a rational blow - down ."
