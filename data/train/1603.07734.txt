    "a basic prediction of @xmath5cdm galaxy - formation models is the existence of a hot ( @xmath6k ) halo of gas accreted from the intergalactic medium around milky way - sized galaxies ( extending to the virial radius ) , which forms as infalling gas is heated to the virial temperature at an accretion shock ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these halos may provide most of the fuel for long - term star formation in these galaxies @xcite , but their predicted properties are sensitive to the input physics , which can be constrained by the measurable properties of the gas .    based on work over the past several years , we know that these extended halos exist , including around the milky way @xcite .",
    "the extent and luminosity of the hot gas implies that it has a similar mass to the stellar disk , and therefore could play an important role in galaxy evolution .",
    "thus , it is important to measure the properties of the hot gas beyond mass and temperature ( such as metallicity and density or velocity structure ) .",
    "however , hot halos are faint and the measurable x - ray luminosity can be dominated by stellar feedback ejecta near the disk @xcite , which makes these measurements difficult .    only in the milky way can one measure the structure , temperature , metallicity , and kinematics of the hot gas through emission and absorption lines @xcite , but kinematic constraints from prior studies @xcite are weak .",
    "recent developments in the calibration of the x - ray grating spectrometers and the accumulation of multiple high quality data sets for individual objects have made it possible to determine line centroids to an accuracy of tens of kms@xmath4 , which enables us to improve the constraints on the kinematics of the gas by measuring doppler shifts in lines that trace the hot gas .",
    "the @xmath721.602  resonance absorption line @xcite is the best candidate , since it is sensitive to temperatures of @xmath8k ( which includes much of the galactic coronal gas ) and it is detected at zero redshift towards a large number of background continuum sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the _ emission _",
    "lines produced by the same species are useful for determining the structure and temperature of the hot gas @xcite , but they are too faint for high resolution spectroscopy . in this paper",
    "we constrain , for the first time , the radial and azimuthal velocity of the hot gas by measuring the doppler shifts in lines detected towards bright sources outside the disk of the milky way .",
    "to measure the global velocity of the million - degree gas around the galaxy , one needs to measure doppler shifts towards a range of sources across the sky in lines sensitive to this temperature .",
    "this gas is detected in x - ray emission and absorption , but the emission lines are far too faint for a focused grating observation .",
    "x - ray imaging ccds measure the energies of incoming photons and are thus also low resolution spectrometers , but their spectral resolution is far too low to measure doppler shifts of tens of kms@xmath4 .",
    "the only instruments capable of this accuracy are the _ chandra _ low / high - energy transmission grating ( letg / hetg ) spectrometers and the _ xmm - newton _ reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) , and the 21.602   line is the only line that probes the relevant temperatures and is detected at @xmath9 towards many background continuum sources . the oviii line at 18.96  probes slightly hotter gas and is only detected towards a few objects .",
    "our initial sample included all archival letg and rgs data sets where the line has been detected in the literature .",
    "the letg has modestly better spectral resolution at 21.6  ( @xmath10 ) than the rgs ( @xmath11 ) , but it only has a third of the effective area at this wavelength ( 15@xmath12 for the letg , 45@xmath12 for the rgs ) . in addition , unlike the letg the rgs is always on ( it has a dedicated telescope , whereas the gratings must be moved into the focal plane on _ chandra _ ) , and thus has accumulated many more spectra .",
    "these factors lead to many more detected lines in the rgs , so we only use the letg data towards several calibration sources as a check on the wavelength solution ( see below ) .",
    "our analysis sample includes 37 known absorbers at @xmath9 with rgs data @xcite ( table  [ table.velocities ] ) .",
    "these include agns as well as several x - ray binaries in the milky way s halo and magellanic clouds .",
    "we tried to include all sources known to be outside the disk with reported absorption lines , but we excluded three sources : ngc  3783 , pks  @xmath13 , and swift  j@xmath14 .",
    "ngc  3783 has an intrinsic oxygen line with a p  cygni profile where we can not disentangle the galactic line , pks  @xmath13 has a broad line that suggests blending or a non - galactic origin , and the line in swift  j@xmath14 is only detected in two of four high @xmath15 exposures .",
    "we include ngc  5408 x-1 ( which is an x - ray binary , not an agn ) and ngc  4051 , but these systems have redshifts smaller than 1000kms@xmath4 so the lines may be intrinsic . ngc  4051 and mcg-6 - 30 - 15 also have known outflows ; as they have lines attributed to the galaxy in some prior studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we include them here , but we show below that excluding them does not strongly change our results .",
    "the data for each target were reprocessed using standard methods in the _ xmm - newton _ science analysis software ( sas v14.0.0 ) with the appropriate calibration files .",
    "this included excluding hot , cold , and `` cool '' pixels , and data from periods when the background count rate exceeds 3@xmath16 from the mean .",
    "we applied the ( default ) empirical correction for the sun angle of the spacecraft and its heliocentric motion @xcite .",
    "we used the highest precision coordinates available rather than the proposal coordinates , which improves the accuracy of the wavelength scale . for each object",
    ", we merged the first - order rgs1 spectra and response matrices into a `` stacked '' spectrum .",
    "standard processing resamples the data from native bins ( about 0.011  at 21.6 ) into a user - specified bin size .",
    "we binned the data to 0.02  ( one resolution element is about 0.055 ) .",
    "this resampling causes small but stochastic changes in the bin assignment for some events , leading to variation under the same protocols , which we quantify by processing each object ten times in the same way .      to measure the doppler shifts ,",
    "we fit a model consisting of a power law and an absorption line to the spectrum in the 21 - 22  bandpass using xspec v12.9.0 @xcite .",
    "we exclude an instrumental artifact between 21.7521.85  in each spectrum , and in several spectra there are one or more bad channels in the bandpass that we also exclude .",
    "the parameters of the absorption - line model include the line centroid , the line width , and the line strength , but we fix the line width at the instrumental line - profile width because we do not expect detectable line broadening , an assumption we validated in the brightest sources .",
    "the best - fit centroid is converted to a velocity using the best - fit line energy from a stacked spectrum of capella as a reference , corrected for the radial velocity of the star ( described below ) .",
    "we measured the velocity for each of the ten stacked spectra per object , and we report the mean value with its 1@xmath16 uncertainty in table  [ table.velocities ] , including the resampling uncertainty .      the systematic uncertainty in the wavelength scale limits the accuracy of our measurements , and recent improvements in the calibration of the wavelength scale @xcite and multiple high @xmath15 spectra for the objects in our sample are largely what enable this study . here",
    "we show the accuracy of the wavelength solution for the protocols we adopt and briefly describe the sources of uncertainty and their magnitudes .",
    "we created spectra for the active stars capella and hr  1099 following the protocols above , then measured the ( emission ) line centroids for strong , mostly unblended lines , and compared them to their laboratory rest wavelengths ( figure  [ figure.capella_wavelength ] ) .",
    "we accounted for the radial velocity of each star ( @xmath17kms@xmath4 for capella and @xmath18kms@xmath4 for hr  1099 ; * ? ? ?",
    "we find no systematic offset in the 5 - 30  bandpass or change over time .",
    "the wavelength offsets in @xmath721.602  for stacked spectra are @xmath19m  ( capella ) and @xmath20m  ( hr  1099 ) .",
    "these correspond to @xmath21 and @xmath22kms@xmath4 .",
    "to verify that stacking does not introduce artificial offsets , we also measured centroids in each individual exposure ( 16 for capella and 14 for hr  1099 ) and computed the weighted mean .",
    "the offsets are consistent with the stacked spectrum : @xmath23 and @xmath24kms@xmath4 for capella and hr  1099 .",
    "we also checked the wavelength solution against the letg and hetg data for these stars .",
    "we reduced te data using the chandra interactive analysis of observations software ( ciao  v4.7 ) , and we found good agreement with spectra from the reduced data available through the tgcat project @xcite .",
    "we co - added the @xmath25first - order spectra and stacked all observations .",
    "the letg offsets are @xmath26kms@xmath4 ( capella ) and @xmath27kms@xmath4 ( hr  1099 ) , whereas the hetg medium energy grating offsets are @xmath28kms@xmath4 ( capella ) and @xmath29kms@xmath4 ( hr  1099 ) .",
    "these results agree with the rgs and the laboratory wavelength ( figure  [ figure.capella_wavelength ] ) .",
    "we also compared velocity measurements between the rgs and letg in the four brightest quasars @xcite .",
    "the letg and rgs centroids agree to within the 1@xmath16 error bar .",
    "these results show that the wavelength scale is sufficiently accurate for our measurement , but it is important to note that there is a substantial systematic scatter that makes _ individual _ observations unreliable , and also that there will be systematic differences between our measurements and those reported for the same data using an earlier version of sas or using incorrect source coordinates .",
    "different observations of the same object have a systematic scatter of @xmath305m  in the wavelength solution around the true mean value .",
    "this corresponds to 70kms@xmath4 at 21.602 , and leads to the standard quoted systematic uncertainty of 100kms@xmath4 .",
    "the reason for this scatter is not clear , but about 3m  could be explained by limits in the pointing accuracy of the telescope @xcite . in any case , the scatter is normally distributed ( based on measurements from many exposures of calibration stars such as capella ) , and can thus be strongly mitigated with multiple observations of the same source . to reduce the scatter to within 20kms@xmath4",
    "requires 15 - 20 independent spectra ( assuming equal @xmath15 and a @xmath31m ) .",
    "the sources in our sample have between 2 - 60 observations , and at the low end the reported 1@xmath16 statistical errors ( 200kms@xmath4 or more ) are much larger than a 70kms@xmath4 systematic error . for the bright quasars with many observations",
    ", we estimate a typical systematic error due to this scatter of @xmath32kms@xmath4 .    .",
    "two models are shown for comparison with the data ( black points ) : a stationary model ( blue points ) and a corotating model ( red points ) .",
    "error bars are 1@xmath16 ( standard deviation ) .",
    "the four objects with the smallest error bars are labeled 1 - 4 .",
    "the velocities of the lines towards mrk  421 and ngc  4051 ( labeled ` 2 ' and ` 3 ' ) suggest some intrinsic scatter .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in addition to the scatter , there are systematic offsets produced by the sun angle of the telescope and its projected heliocentric motion ( possibly an inaccuracy in the star - tracker ) that were measured and corrected by @xcite ; we refer the reader to their paper for a detailed description .",
    "the earliest version of sas that conained these corrections was v13.0.0 , and it was not enabled by default until v14.0.0 ; all prior absorption - line halo studies using the rgs used an earlier version or did not mention the correction .",
    "we measured line centroids with and without these corrections , and found centroid shifts in our sample with magnitudes between @xmath33kms@xmath4 ( higher for weak lines ) . to show the effect of not including them , we show the measured centroids without these corrections in table  [ table.velocities ] .",
    "finally , if we used the default ( proposal ) coordinates instead of the simbad coordinates , we measured offsets of @xmath34kms@xmath4 .",
    "thus , we would expect our measured centroids to be correlated with prior results but perhaps significantly different relative to the statistical errors .",
    "for example , there is a systematic offset of about 60kms@xmath4 between our measurements and @xcite for the several systems where it can be measured .",
    "this offset can not be entirely explained by the sun angle and heliocentric motion corrections , but it is consistent with shifts seen relative to prior versions of sas @xcite .",
    "they do not report the line centroids for active stars , as they only need to measure the centroids to sufficient accuracy to identify halo absorbers .",
    "thus , we do not regard the apparent inconsistency as reflecting an inherent uncertainty in line centroid measurements .",

    "however , if the line is unresolved but has some physical width ( so that incident photons would be dispersed over multiple bins even before the lsf spreads them out ) , the error is strongly mitigated .",
    "we used xspec simulations to determine the error as a function of doppler @xmath217 parameter , and for @xmath225kms@xmath4 ( about the thermal width even without turbulence ) , the typical error is reduced to 15kms@xmath4 ( figure  [ figure.lsf_error ] ) .",
    "we expect the galactic halo lines to be in this regime .",
    "alternatively , one can ignore the columns , but because of their proximity to the region of interest , this will also bias the results .",
    "overall , the systematic error should allow measurements to better than 30kms@xmath4 accuracy with sufficient @xmath15 .",
    "for the high @xmath15 lines we estimate a typical systematic error of 15 - 20kms@xmath4 , and for lines weaker than about 4@xmath16 , the systematic error is dominated by the statistical error .",
    "we used a simple halo model for comparison to the data .",
    "we adopted an extended density profile @xcite in which @xmath226 where @xmath227@xmath228kpc@xmath229 and @xmath230 , computed on a grid with 0.05kpc cells .",
    "this model describes a large , all - sky sample of 649 and oviii emission lines @xcite well .",
    "we then imposed global bulk radial ( @xmath231 ) or azimuthal ( @xmath232 ) velocities , assuming that these are constant with radius .",
    "these are the free parameters in the model .",
    "we likewise assume a constant metallicity ( @xmath233 ) and a doppler @xmath217 parameter of 85kms@xmath4 due to random turbulent motion in each cell , based on hydrodynamic simulations @xcite",
    ". we also account for the possibility of intrinsic scatter ( resulting from hydrodynamic flows ) about any model by adding a velocity dispersion to the velocities when comparing to the models .",
    "this dispersion is not the same as line _ broadening _ , but refers to the typical value for a distribution of centroid shifts .",
    "we obtain model velocities for each object by integrating from the position of the sun outward along each line of sight , computing the line - of - sight velocity component and broadening for each cell and summing the resultant voigt profiles ( a more detailed description is given in * ? ? ?",
    "we convolve the result with the lsf , compute the centroid , and add the solar reflex motion for comparison to the observations . in other words ,",
    "the velocities are compared in the frame of the local standard of rest . for this model ,",
    "at least 50% of the total absorption comes from beyond 7kpc from the sun , and 90% from within 50kpc . in the simplest case of a stationary halo ,",
    "the galactic rotation of the local standard of rest @xcite ( @xmath234kms@xmath4 ) is reflected in the measured doppler shifts : @xmath235 , where @xmath236 is the galactic longitude and @xmath217 the galactic latitude .",
    "the product @xmath237 corresponds to the sun moving directly towards or away from that direction , resulting in a doppler shift of @xmath238kms@xmath4 .",
    "another simple case is a corotating halo ( @xmath239 ) , in which case the doppler shifts will be closer to zero .",
    "figure  [ figure.velocities ] shows the measured velocities with the stationary and corotating models .",
    "the best - fit @xmath231 and @xmath232 values were obtained from a markov - chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) approach , using the @xmath240 statistic as a goodness - of - fit parameter . for zero dispersion ,",
    "the best model has a prograde rotation velocity of @xmath241kms@xmath4 and a global inflow of @xmath242kms@xmath4 , corresponding to a net accretion rate of @xmath243yr@xmath4 ( figure  [ figure.results ] ) .",
    "this is a formally acceptable fit , whereas the stationary halo is rejected with 99.95% probability and the corotating halo is marginally rejected with 95% probability .",
    "the velocity dispersion for which the reduced @xmath240 is closest to 1.0 is about 50kms@xmath4 ( figure  [ figure.results ] ) ; substantially more than this produces a @xmath240 that is too small for the observed line centroids .",
    "the apparent inflow is not statistically significant , and the suggestion of inflow primarily results from mrk  421 ( figure  [ figure.velocities ] ) , which has a small uncertainty and is near @xmath244 .",
    "taking these results at face value , the large @xmath232 and extent of the halo imply that the total angular momentum of the hot gas within 50kpc is comparable to that in the stars and gas in the disk of the galaxy @xcite ( figure  [ figure.momentum ] ) .",
    "the spread in recent measurements of @xmath245kms@xmath4 @xcite leads to @xmath246kms@xmath4 , which does not change the picture of a lagging halo with prograde rotation .",
    "in addition to parameter fitting , we used nonparametric statistical tests to test the hypothesis that some rotation is necessary .",
    "we tested the stationary and corotating models using the sign test and the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test , which compare distributions and are less sensitive to scatter .",
    "the sign test asks whether the medians of the measured and model velocities are consistent with each other ( assuming a binomial distribution and a 50% probability that the model velocity exceeds the measured velocity ) .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ figure.nonpar ] shows the residuals from subtracting the data from the stationary model values , and the strong asymmetry rules out the stationary model with 99.87% probability . the ks test compares the cumulative distributions of the measured and model velocities , and this test rules out the stationary halo with 98.5% probability .",
    "the corotating model is acceptable in the sign test ( 43% rejection probability ) and not in the ks test ( 99.8% probability ) .",
    "the rejection of the stationary halo is model independent .",
    "if we exclude weak lines with @xmath247kms@xmath4 , a stationary model is still ruled out at more than 99.4% probability .",
    "if we exclude ambiguous lines ( such as those towards ngc  5408 x-1 , ngc  4051 , and mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ) , a stationary model is ruled out at about 98% probability in the ks test and 99.6% in the sign test .",
    "excluding ngc  4051 ( with its small error bars ) increases the range of acceptable @xmath232 in the parametric fits , but the best - fit @xmath231 does not change much as the error bars for mrk  421 are even smaller .",
    "we investigated the sensitivity of the best - fit parameters and the implied angular momentum to the model assumptions .",
    "first , the assumption of constant velocity must break down at some radius .",
    "an effort to measure the galactic rotation curve to 200kpc using disk and non - disk objects found @xcite that @xmath232 is flat to 80kpc , while a measurement from disk stars in the sloan digital sky survey found @xcite that @xmath232 in the disk declines by 15% from @xmath248 at 10 - 20kpc and remains constant from 20 - 55kpc ( the maximum probed ) .",
    "thus , the assumption of a constant @xmath249 or @xmath232 within @xmath250kpc appears to be reasonable , and more than 80% of the cumulative equivalent width comes from within this region ( figure  [ figure.momentum ] ) .",
    "when we considered a model with a constant @xmath232 within 50kpc and @xmath251kms@xmath4 beyond , the best - fit @xmath232 is nearly identical to the reported value . for a 10kpc cutoff , the best - fit @xmath232 increases .",
    "second , there may be a metallicity gradient in the hot gas , in which case the cumulative equivalent width will be even more dominated by nearby gas .",
    "this would impact the inferred mass and total angular momentum of the halo gas . constraints from o vii and oviii and pulsar dispersion measures towards the large magellanic cloud are consistent @xcite with a gradient of @xmath252 with @xmath253 at 1kpc and @xmath254 at 10kpc .",
    "the uncertainty is large , but the gradient is shallow enough that gas beyond a few kpc contributes 50% or more of the equivalent width .",
    "finally , even a single - component hot halo is probably not isothermal and may also have flows arising from satellite galaxy motions or gaseous inflows and outflows . since the combined emission- and absorption - line data favor an extended halo and its temperature is near the virial temperature , the gas is probably volume filling .",
    "hydrodynamic flows in such a halo will primarily induce scatter of the type described above , which does not strongly affect our @xmath232 measurement ( figure  [ figure.results ] ) .",
    "thus , the measured halo rotation probably extends to tens of kpc and possibly to 100kpc , and this gas will have a substantial angular momentum .",
    "however , the angular momentum values ( figure  [ figure.momentum ] ) are strongly model dependent , especially due to the assumption of constant @xmath255 .",
    "the interpretation of the measured doppler shifts as a rotation signature depends on the validity of our single - component halo model .",
    "this depends on the following assumptions : ( 1 ) a volume - filling spherical halo is an approximately accurate representation of most of the hot gas around the galaxy ; ( 2 ) there is no strong local absorber that we have ignored ; ( 3 ) the spherical halo has bulk global motion ; ( 4 ) the assumption of @xmath256 is reasonable within about 50kpc ; and ( 5 ) the doppler shift measurements are accurate .",
    "the fourth and fifth assumptions were addressed above , so here we focus on the first three .",
    "two basic models are suggested in the literature for the structure of the hot halo : an extended , spherical distribution or an exponential disk with a scale height of a few kpc . when using individual sight lines or small samples @xcite , the observed and absorption and emission line strengths are consistent with an exponential disk model with a scale height of a few kpc .",
    "they are also consistent with a spherical model .",
    "however , larger samples of absorption lines ( @xmath3040 sight lines ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the all - sky emission - line intensities ( @xmath2571,000 sight lines * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) favor a spherical model .",
    "similar analyses on independent observables that also probe the hot gas , such as the pulsar dispersion measure towards the large magellanic cloud and the ram - pressure stripping of milky way satellites favor an extended halo @xcite .",
    "finally , a recent analysis of both galactic and extragalactic sightlines for @xmath258 galaxies finds that the traces hot gas @xcite .",
    "thus , we adopted the spherical density profile of @xcite .",
    "however , these analyses are based on single - component models , and from basic galaxy models we expect at least two x - ray absorbing components : infalling gas that is shock heated to the virial temperature ( @xmath259k for the milky way ) and forms an extended halo ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and supernova - driven outflows from the disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the latter case",
    ", we expect an exponential disk of hot gas with a scale height set ( for a given galactocentric radius ) by the temperature at the midplane . it is worth noting that",
    "for @xmath260k , the scale height at the solar circle is larger than the galactocentric distance , so the distribution of outflowing gas could also be spherical , if not very extended ; the true shape depends on how widespread the outflows are in the disk , the actual midplane temperature , and the amount of radiative cooling . within the galaxy disk itself ,",
    "supernovae contribute to the hot interstellar medium , much of which is confined within the disk . since x - ray absorption covers a wider temperature range than emission , we are also weakly sensitive to cooler gas ( described in the following subsection ) .",
    "these components may be kinematically distinct , as is seen in the warm gas by @xcite , but at the relatively low resolution of the rgs , we expect them to be blended .",
    "this complicates the interpretation of the measured centroids , which are the weighted average of the offsets for each component along that line of sight . at a qualitative level",
    ", we expect the gas confined in the galaxy disk to rotate with it ( although depending on the distances to the absorbers , there may not be any rotation signature ) and the gas in supernova - driven outflows to rotate in the same direction but lagging the disk as it reaches larger heights or radii .    to constrain the column and thus the influence on the line centroids from a disk component , we extended the analysis of @xcite to fit a disk@xmath261halo model to the same data set they used : 648 emission lines from @xcite , which are filtered for contamination from solar - wind charge exchange and ignore most of the galactic plane .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a more detailed explanation of the modeling procedure , but we summarize our model components here .",
    "the sun exists in a region known as the local bubble , which emits soft x - rays ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and we adopt for the bubble a temperature of @xmath262k , a variable path length between 100 - 300pc , and a density @xmath263@xmath228 .",
    "the nature of the bubble and the density remain debatable because of the contribution from solar - wind charge exchange ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have ignored hot interstellar gas confined within the galaxy disk other than the local bubble .",
    "constraints from the intensity of the soft x - ray background imply that our sight lines will incur only a small column from this material , and the emission - line sample excludes the galactic plane .",
    "for the extended halo component , we assume an isothermal ( @xmath264k ) plasma with a density profile described by equation  [ equation.beta_model ] .",
    "for the exponential disk component , we assume a form for the density of @xmath265 where @xmath266 is the scale height .",
    "the temperature declines in an analogous way , and we fix the midplane temperature and its scale height to @xmath267k and 5.6kpc , respectively @xcite because we do not model the line ratios as a temperature diagnostic .",
    "the free parameters are the normalizations , @xmath268 , and @xmath266 , which we constrain using the same mcmc method as @xcite .",
    "we assume that each component is optically thin and compute its contribution to the intensity along each line - of - sight @xmath269 : @xmath270 where @xmath271 is the volumetric line emissivity from the apec thermal plasma code @xcite .",
    "finally , the line intensities from @xcite do not account for absorption due to galactic hi , so to compare our model intensities to theirs we apply photoelectric absorption using the neutral hydrogen column from @xcite to the halo and disk components : @xmath272 where @xmath16 is the absorption cross - section and @xmath273 is the intensity from the local bubble .",
    "figure  [ figure.disk_halo ] shows the results from the mcmc analysis as marginalized posterior probability distributions for each of the free parameters .",
    "the model is not a significant improvement on the pure halo model , and the best - fit parameters for the halo ( @xmath274@xmath228kpc@xmath229 , @xmath275 ) are consistent with the results in @xcite .",
    "the disk parameters are poorly constrained and indicate that _ the exponential disk contributes at most 10% of the total column density .",
    "_ this corroborates the @xcite result .",
    "in contrast , the @xcite disk model ( which assumes the halo gas can be described entirely by a disk and is based on one sightline ) finds @xmath276 and @xmath277kpc .",
    "@xcite , who include some sight lines near the galactic plane and some outside the plane , find that the column is consistent with @xmath278@xmath228 and a scale height of @xmath279kpc , but the authors acknowledge that mixing results from sight lines towards nearby x - ray binaries at low latitudes and those at high latitudes can lead to a strong bias ; the hot material confined to the galaxy disk is not part of the exponential disk structure that we have modeled , but it can contribute at low latitudes .",
    "thus , the impact of the disk component on the measured centroids must be small , since 80 - 90% of the column density will come from the spherical component .",
    "assuming that the two components are kinematically distinct , for the latter to be stationary and consistent with the measured centroids requires a disk speed much faster than co - rotation .",
    "we verified this by modeling a rotating disk and a stationary halo where the disk contributes 10% of the column . since this is inconsistent with models where the gas originates in the galaxy disk , the data probe motion in the spherical component . for reference ,",
    "if the @xcite disk model is adopted instead of the @xcite model or our disk@xmath261halo model , the best - fit azimuthal and radial velocities are @xmath280kms@xmath4 and @xmath281kms@xmath4 .    we have assumed that , to first order , the spherical component moves as a solid body with some @xmath232 and @xmath231",
    ". there may be second - order effects such as the internal flows mentioned above ( perhaps due to satellite motions or infalling clouds ) or modes in the fluid , which would add scatter to the velocity measurements .",
    "however , if the halo is volume filling and in steady state , then large scale disturbances will tend to dissipate in a sound - crossing time ( which could be a long time if the halo is very extended ) , and the gas ( if stationary ) will tend towards hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "multiple major kinematic components are therefore not expected , although we would expect differential rotation . in this case , the measured rotation velocity is some average but still provides useful information .",
    "also , if the material is fresh infall from the cosmic web then it likely accretes along filaments , which lead to a preferential orbital angular momentum axis .",
    "finally , gas ejected from the disk ( either cold or hot ) could spin up the halo @xcite , although perhaps not to the velocity that we infer .",
    "it is possible that there is a layer of warm - hot gas near the galactic plane ( in addition to the local bubble ) that affects every sight line out of the galaxy , but to which our models are not sensitive because we ignore data close to the galactic plane ( where dust , supernova remnants , and other features make modeling very difficult ) . characterizing the structure and filling factor of the hot interstellar medium",
    "has been a major effort by itself ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is beyond the scope of this paper , but if there is such a layer ( possibly a disk with a scale height of a few hundred pc ) with a high density , the rotation signature in the rgs data could be misattributed to the halo . on the other hand , for plausible path lengths , oxygen column densities , and foreground absorption column densities this layer should also produce emission in excess of the local bubble contribution to the soft x - ray background .    to summarize , the halo models that are based on many data points as opposed to a few sightlines favor a spherical halo ( especially in emission ) as the dominant component .",
    "any contribution to the column density from a kinematically distinct ( thick ) exponential disk is small in this scenario , so the doppler shifts support a non - stationary extended halo .",
    "reinterpreting these shifts will be necessary if future data or analyses rule out a spherical halo ( or at least a volume - filling one ) or a high resolution x - ray spectrometer resolves the lines into components inconsistent with rotation . also , we reiterate that the parametric fit strongly depends on the few agns with the highest @xmath15 , but the nonparametric tests indicate rotation at some level .",
    "the ion fraction is high between @xmath282k , so the cooler ( non - coronal ) gas seen in and around the galaxy in with _ fuse _ @xcite will also absorb .",
    "the lines towards background objects reveal galactic and high - velocity absorbers @xcite .",
    "the galactic absorbers ( also seen towards stars ) are consistent with an exponential disk of scale height 1 - 4kpc @xcite , whereas the high - velocity absorbers may come from the halo or outside the galaxy .",
    "if the column densities of these absorbers are high , then their lines could bias our results . since the disk component will rotate , we are most concerned about contamination from this gas .",
    "@xcite measured column densities for about 150 sight lines around the galaxy and found a typical column of @xmath283@xmath284 .",
    "for the sight lines in our sample , we expect @xmath285@xmath284 .",
    "if the absorbers are at @xmath286k and in collisional ionization equilibrium , the o vii/ ratio is 1.7 , which leads to an expected contribution of @xmath287@xmath284 .",
    "in contrast , the typical column ( assuming an optically thin plasma ) is @xmath288@xmath284 @xcite .",
    "hence , the contribution directly from absorbers in the galaxy is at most 15% .",
    "it is likely lower , since @xcite and @xcite argue that the lines are not optically thin .",
    "the bias from the absorbers also declines at higher latitude , since the column declines more slowly than the column with increasing @xmath217 ( corroborated in _ emission _ by * ? ? ?",
    "for most of our sight lines we estimate that the local and disk contribution to the column is less than 10% .",
    "even a 10% contribution is important for measuring the true halo velocity , but compared to the uncertainty in our best - fit velocity parameters , it is small .",
    "more importantly , as with the hot disk considered above , it can not by itself account for the measured velocities if we assume that the million - degree halo is stationary .      we have measured a signature of rotation in the line around the milky way using 37 sight lines towards background agns and archival rgs data .",
    "the parametric fit strongly depends on the brightest agns , but nonparametric tests indicate that the absorbers are not stationary , even when removing suspect lines . from larger samples of emission and absorption lines , we believe that an extended halo is more consistent with the data than an exponential ( thick ) disk , and in this case this halo rotates at some velocity smaller than @xmath248 . taken at face value",
    ", this implies that the million - degree gas has a comparable angular momentum to the galaxy disk .",
    "it is possible that both components exist , in which case the rgs lines are blends of kinematically distinct components .",
    "we use a large sample of emission lines to constrain the contribution of each component to the column density , and find that an exponential disk accounts for no more than 10% of the column density .",
    "thus , the measured doppler shifts are dominated by the motion of the gas in the extended halo , which is consistent with prograde rotation .",
    "even if a disk were to dominate ( which , for our data , produces an unacceptable @xmath240 value ) , the best - fit azimuthal velocities imply that it is rotating at nearly the same speed and with a comparable amount of angular momentum to the spherical model .",
    "this conclusion depends on assumptions about the underlying model .",
    "measuring the true velocity and separating the x - ray absorbers into their various components requires a high - resolution x - ray instrument with a large effective area ( e.g. _ arcus _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which would also give important information on their line shapes that could constrain the optical depth and doppler @xmath217 parameters @xcite , as well as reveal the contribution to the total column from the disk and the coronal halo gas seen in x - ray emission .",
    "the recent work on calibrating the conversion of dispersion angle to a wavelength grid for the rgs @xcite and stacking multiple observations of the same object enables a wavelength accuracy of tens of kms@xmath4 for the first time ( figure  [ figure.capella_wavelength ] ) . after investigating a variety of systematic issues , we find that the statistical uncertainty ( due to the low @xmath15 in many spectra and the relatively small sample ) remains the major source of error .",
    "the inferred halo velocity and angular momentum are strongly model dependent ( and the uncertainties that we report are large ) , but the basic conclusion that the hot gas distribution rotates is less so .",
    "several scenarios could produce a rotating halo that lags behind the disk , depending on the geometry .",
    "these include a galactic fountain of cool gas that spins up hot gas @xcite , a hot galactic fountain of superbubble ejecta that produces an exponential disk before cooling , or infall from the cosmic web with some preferential direction .",
    "our measurements can not , by themselves , distinguish between these models ( which may not be mutually exclusive ) , but they are an important kinematic constraint for future halo and galaxy formation models .",
