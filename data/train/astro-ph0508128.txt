    "the year 2004 marked the @xmath19 anniversary of the discovery of the compact radio source sgra@xmath0@xcite , which is now firmly believed by many to be the manifestation of a supermassive black hole that sits at the very heart of the milky way and around which everything in the galaxy turns .",
    "that year also marked the first detection of @xmath17-raysfrom a compact region of size @xmath1610 arcminutes around sgra@xmath0with the _ integral_observatory in the energy range from 20 to 100  @xmath1 @xcite and with the _",

    "after three decades of observations , we finally detected a source of very high - energy radiation that appears to be point - like and coincident with the galactic nucleus ( gc ) .",
    "however , the exact nature of the highly energetic emission from this compact region is unknown .",
    "our aim here is to present observational evidence that will lead to a deeper understanding of the emission process , and help to unfold the mystery of the @xmath17-raysarriving from the heart of the milky way .",
    "the galactic nuclear region is very dense and complex  so dense that certainly more than one source could contribute to the high - energy flux detected by present - day @xmath17-rayinstruments with typical angular resolutions of 1015 arcminutes .",
    "located at 8  @xmath9 from the sun , the galactic center ( gc ) harbours a supermassive black hole whose presence and mass of about 3.6@xmath2@xmath3  @xmath22 were deduced primarily from near - infrared ( nir ) observations and measurements of the velocity and proper motion of the stars contained in the central cluster @xcite .",
    "a black hole ( bh ) of this mass has a schwarzschild radius ( @xmath23 ) of about 1.2@xmath2@xmath24  @xmath25 and is expected to accrete the matter from its nearby environment producing a detectable emission in a broad range of frequencies @xcite .",
    "the bright , compact , non - thermal radio source sgra@xmath0 , located at less than 0@xmath26.01 from the dynamical center of the central star cluster , is most likely the manifestation of such accretion processes .",
    "undetectable in the visible and uvbands due to the large galactic absorption , and only recently detected in nirboth in quiescent , and flaring states @xcite , this source is surprisingly weak in x - rays , where it appears slightly extended with a luminosity of only @xmath27@xmath282@xmath2@xmath29ergs@xmath13@xcite .",
    "the dense central region of the milky way where the 210  @xmath1 flux is heavily dominated by diffuse radiation , includes the emission from a hot ( @xmath30@xmath1668  @xmath1 ) probably unbound thermal plasma component , the supernova remnant ( snr ) sgraeast , several knots and filaments , and thousands of point sources @xcite .",

    "the majority of flares have spectra that are significantly harder ( power law photon index @xmath31@xmath161.5 ) than the quiescent spectrum ( @xmath31@xmath162.7 ) , but the most powerful of them was quite soft ( @xmath31@xmath162.5 ) . note that dust scattering can have some effect on the observed fluxes and spectral indeces of both the quiescent and flaring states of sgra@xmath0@xcite .",
    "variations on time scales as short as 200  @xmath4 have been detected during flares indicating an emitting region with a size of the order of 10@xmath23 .",
    "chandra_and _ xmm - newton_campaigns have allowed us to estimate the average x - ray flare rate to about 1 per day bearing in mind that the flaring events appear to be clustered @xcite . at slightly longer wavelengths , nirobservations with the _ vlt _ naco imager @xcite and _ keck _ telescope @xcite",
    "have shown that sgra@xmath0is also the source of frequent irflares with durations comensurable with those seen in x - rays .",
    "some irflares even appear to be simultaneous with x - rayflares @xcite .",
    "both the irand x - rayflaring events strongly suggest the presence of an important population of non - thermal relativistic electrons in the vicinity of the bhhorizon @xcite and therefore their detection has raised great interest in the possibility of observing hard x - raysfrom the galactic nucleus .",
    "sgra@xmath0 s bolometric luminosity from radio to x - rays(including the flares ) barely amounts to a few @xmath32ergs@xmath13 , while the eddington luminosity for a bhof its mass reaches @xmath33@xmath284@xmath2@xmath34ergs@xmath13 .",
    "even the expected accretion luminosity , based on an estimated stellar wind mass rate at the accretion radius , is of the order of @xmath35ergs@xmath13 , i.e. about 6 to 7 orders of magnitude higher than sgra@xmath0 s total observed emitted power ( see cuadra et al .",
    "2005 for a recent update on the issue ) .    in the 1990 s",
    "it was thought that the bulk of the power could be found at higher energies ; in hard x - raysas is the case for bhbinaries in the hard state , or even at the electron - positron annihilation energy of 511  @xmath1 ( see e.g. genzel & townes  1987 ) .",

    "meanwhile the _ hess_collaboration @xcite announced the detection of a bright source of tev photons coincident with sgra@xmath0to within 1@xmath8 .",
    "the source appears to be point - like , stable , with a power - law spectrum of index of 2.2 and a luminosity of @xmath37@xmath28@xmath12ergs@xmath13 .",
    "this wealth of high - energy data all point to the presence of one , or several , high energy non - thermal emission components likely produced by accelerated particles in the environment of the gc .",
    "both leptonic and hadronic origins for the accelerated particles giving rise to the @xmath17-rayshave been considered either in the inner @xcite or outer @xcite region of sgra@xmath0 , while melia et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , fatuzzo & melia ( 2003 ) and recently crocker et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , discussed the possibility that the site of particle acceleration could be the unusual supernova remnant sgraeast .",
    "sgraeastis a mixed morphology snrwhose center is at less than 1@xmath8from sgra@xmath0and whose radio shell spans a few arcminutes . given its position and dimensions it would appear like a stable point - like source for @xmath17-rayobservatories .",
    "this remnant is characterised by a non - thermal radio shell at the center of which lies an apparently ejecta - dominated x - rayemiting region whose spectrum indicates that the plasma is rich in heavy elements especially towards the core where fe abundances reach 45 times solar @xcite .",
    "for this reason , it has been classified as a metal - rich mixed morphology snr .",
    "the fact that sgraeastis the smallest of the known snrs of this type and that its radio shell appears to be quite symmetrical , although slightly elongated along the galactic plane , suggests that the ejecta from the explosion have expanded in a very dense but more or less homogenous environment @xcite . according to a more recent analysis of the x - rayfeatures of sgraeastby sakano et al .",
    "( 2004 ) based on _ xmm - newton_observations , the derived total energy , mass and abundance pattern are consistent with a single supernova event of type ia or type ii involving a relatively low - mass progenitor star . furthermore , according to these authors the morphology and spectral characteristics do not show evidence of a clear connection between the snrand past activity in sgra@xmath0 .",
    "sgraeastmay very well have arisen from a single explosion akin to most other supernova events in terms of its energetics as is suggested by sakano et al .",
    "the most recent simulations for its genesis and evolution ( fryer et al .",
    "2005 ) indicate that the progenitor was likely a star of mass @xmath1615@xmath38 that exploded a mere @xmath161750 years ago . reaching the m-0.02 - 0.07 cloud",
    "some 300400 years ago , the expanding shock collided with the dense molecular gas , producing a bright flash of 2200  @xmath1 emission lasting several hundred years , whose x - ray echo we may be viewing today in the form of fe fluorescent emission from sgr b2 ( and other nearby clouds ) .",
    "however , sgr a east does distinguish itself from other galactic remnants in three important ways .",
    "first , it is located very near the gc , within 50@xmath26of sgra@xmath0 , and is therefore subject to interactions and forces uncommon in the rest of the galaxy .",
    "second , its non - thermal shell emission caused by synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons has an unusually high surface brightness compared to other galactic snr@xcite .",
    "third , oh ( 1720 mhz ) maser emission detected in several locations around the gc , and particularly at the boundary of sgraeastand the m-0.02 - 0.07 molecular cloud , indicates the presence of strong shocks where rapid acceleration of electrons ( and protons ) is taking place , in a medium threaded by very strong magnetic fields of order 24  @xmath39 @xcite . as pointed out by yusef - zadeh , melia & wardle ( 2000 ) , the presence of relativistic electrons and strong magnetic fields within sgraeastmakes it a unique and potentially powerful galactic accelerator .",
    "other possible sources of non - thermal @xmath17-rays , some of which were initially proposed to explain certain features of the x - rayemission like the hot component and the bright 6.4  @xmath1 line of neutral fe , or the non - thermal radio characteristics of the region , include the radio arc , several non - thermal filaments and regions marked by cosmic ray electron interactions @xcite , supernova ejecta @xcite , and scattering of highly energetic radiations from molecular clouds . in particular",
    "revnivtsev et al .  (",
    "2004 ) proposed a model in which the _ integral_source igrj174752822 , coincident with the dense molecur cloud sgrb2 , is due to compton reflection ( i.e. the scattering of high - energy photons by cold electrons in the outer layers of the cloud ) of very energetic emission from a very powerful flare in the sgra@xmath0system about 300 years ago . in any case",

    "( 2003 ) . following the recommendations related to the use of the osasoftware",
    ", we restricted our analysis to events with energies greater than 20  @xmath1 .",
    "a number of additional procedures were implemented in order to maximize the quality of our analysis given the large data set and the complexity of galactic nuclear region .",
    "for instance , the analysis was consistently done twice : a first time to make a catalog of detected sources and perform a preliminary evaluation of the quality of each sky image , and a second time to ensure that all known sources in a given field of view were modeled correctly in the reconstruction of each sky image .",
    "the total number of sources detected by isgriwithin 10@xmath18of the gc , and therefore included in the analysis input catalog is 80 .",
    "the background maps were constructed from empty field observations at high latitudes in 256 bands from 17 to 1000  @xmath1 and incorporated in the standard analysis where they were combined to match the chosen energy ranges . this procedure has allowed us to achieve the best possible quality for individual sky images and thus for the mosaic and spectrum .",
    "other additional analysis procedures are detailed in the sections that follow .      for a coded mask instrument like ibis ,",
    "a sky image is obtained by convolving the detector image or shadowgram with a decoding array derived from the spatial characteristics of the mask . for each sky image",
    "there is an intensity map ( @xmath44 ) , a variance map ( @xmath45 ) proportional to the total counts recorded in each pixel , and a significance map ( @xmath46 ) constructed from these as @xmath47 .",
    "given that source photons are a very small fraction of the total counts , the background heavily dominates and the histogram of significance values for a given deconvolved image should follow the standard normal distribution .",
    "significant detections appear as spikes in the positive tail of the distribution .",
    "a broadening of this distribution is caused by systematic effects unaccounted for in the standard analysis software .",
    "therefore , the standard deviation of the distribution of significance values can be effectively used to characterize and quantify the quality of a given sky image , and must be taken into account when calculating the true detection significance of a signal in that image .",
    "for this reason , we have weighted each sky image according to the variance of its significance distribution to produce sky maps in seven energy bands from 20 to 400 kev ; namely 2030 , 3040 , 4056 , 5685 , 85120 , 120200 , 200400  @xmath1 , and to construct the spectrum of the gcsource igrj174562901 .",
    "we also performed the analysis of another energy band from 500 to 522  @xmath1 which yielded upper limits compatible with the spidetection of the electron - positron 511  @xmath1 annihilation line reported in knodlseder et al .",
    "( 2005 ) ( see [ s : results ] ) .",
    "the mosaics were made using the _ pixel spread _ option in the osa4.2 imaging procedure which by projecting and distributing pixel values on the final mosaic pixel grid , preserves the symmetry of the point spread function ( psf ) and allows the most accurate source positioning .",
    "since the central source is too weak to be fitted with the psfin the imaging procedure performed on each pointing , the light curve was obtained by extracting the count rate at the source s pixel position from each reconstructed image .",
    "the densely populated region around sgra@xmath0contains at least eight sources detected by isgriwithin 1 degree of the gc . since the standard osapipeline does not perform simultaneous fitting of several sources , we have used a custom fitting procedure to determine the best fit positions of the sources in the neighborhood of the gc .",
    "sub - images 40@xmath240 pixels in size centered on the radio position of sgra@xmath0were extracted from the mosaics in the different energy bands and fitted using a model that included up to eight point - sources , each characterised by a 2d gaussian approximation of the system point spread function and applied in the osasoftware @xcite    the width of the psfwas left as free global parameter ( 1 for all sources ) because for mosaics , the width of the final psfcannot be predicted .",
    "the presence of close sources and possible confusion does not influence the result since a very strong point - like source ( 1e1740.72942 ) dominates the images and this parameter is basically determined by the fit of this source .",
    "the procedure gives us the possibility to fix the position of some sources and also to set a flat background level to be fitted together with the point - sources .",
    "the residual map is inspected to verify that the fitting procedure is performed correctly .",
    "statistical errors at 90% confidence level on the fitted positions were derived from the measured source signal - to - noise ratios using the empirical law determined through a systematic study of well known sources @xcite . although the empirical function of the source location accuracy in terms of the detection significance was determined using images reconstructed from single pointings , it was recently validated on mosaics as well .",
    "these tests were performed on isolated point - sources and since we are studying a region where the source density is unusually high , we present the results of our simultaneous fit for all the sources in the field to show that the offsets from the known positions are compatible with the empirical point - source location accuracy ( psla ) .      the standard isgrispectral extraction software works on the basis of a single pointing in the following manner . using a list of sources ,",
    "the procedure first calculates the pixel illumination factor ; a model of the shadow of the mask cast on the detector plane by a given source . with this set of modeled shadowgrams ,",
    "the software then attempts to fit the detector image by adjusting the relative intensity of each source either together with the background level simultaneously or by subtracting a background map normalized to the mean count rate beforehand .",
    "these procedures therefore estimate the maximum likelihood intensity of each source and in each pointing .",
    "however , a difficulty arises in the case of week sources ( @xmath16mcrab ) that require very long exposure times to acquire sufficient statistics to be detected . in such cases , and in particular when a large number of sources have to be modelled , the most efficient way to derive a spectrum is to build and clean sky images in the desired energy bands and then to extract in each the intensity and its associated variance at the pixel that corresponds to the source position , and to calculate the weighted mean count rate .",
    "as was described in the previous section , the variance at a given pixel must be corrected to take into account the systematic effects that grow additively with exposure time . in the case of igrj174562901",
    ", the flux and variance values were taken at the pixel that corresponds to the sky coordinates r.a.=266.4168 , decl.=29.0078 ( j2000 ) in each sky map ; the position of sgra@xmath0 .",
    "the x - rayspectrum in the range 110  @xmath1 was extracted using 2004 _ xmm - newton _ data from a circular region centered on the position of igrj174562901and with a radius of 8 arcminutes .",
    "this radius was chosen to match the 13@xmath8psffull width half max ( fwhm ) of the ibis / isgriinstrument derived from the quadratric sum of the projected pixel ( 5@xmath8 ) and mask element ( 12@xmath8 ) sizes @xcite .",
    "for a spectral extraction in which a large portion of the camera s field of view is used as a collecting surface , it is most suitable to use _ xmm - newton_background event files compiled from high latitude observations to construct a background spectrum .",
    "the procedure can be summarized as follows .",
    "epicpn , mos1 and mos2 event files are filtered to exclude all non x - raytriggers using the event flag and pattern , after which a good time interval ( gti ) selection is performed to exclude periods of solar flaring activity .",
    "the gtiselection criteria are based on the count rates in the high - energy bands , i.e. : 1012  @xmath1 for mos1 and mos2 , and 1214  @xmath1 for pn .",
    "an interval of 100  @xmath4 qualifies as a gtiif it has less than 18  @xmath48 for both moscameras and 22  @xmath48 in the case of the pncamera .",
    "these strict selection criteria ensure that only the cleanest parts of the observation are used .",
    "the resulting filtered event files are used to make images in the high - energy bands in which a uniform distribution of events is expected under the assumption that energetic charged particles heavily dominate the instruments respective spectra at these energies and that these fall uniformly on the telescope .",
    "if no point - sources are visible in these images , the ratios of the average count rate in the images to that of the background event file are used to scale the background spectra .",

    "we can see that the spatial distribution of the modeled image resembles very closely that of the mosaic , even if the residues hint at the presence of a non - uniform underlying emission that is not properly taken into account in the tested model .",
    "the fitted source positions are listed in table[t : sourcepositions ] where we also report the signal - to - noise , the estimated error radius corresonding to the 90% confidence level and the offset with respect to the proposed counterpart .",

    "the source we labeled slx1744299 , is in fact a system composed of two known x - ray bursters located within @xmath163@xmath8of each other @xcite and for this reason we do not expect the fit to yield a position within the pslafor either one of the two sources , independently of the detection significance .",
    "1e1743.12853 , a well known , bright x - ray source @xcite is almost certainly contributing to the high - energy emission in the region .",
    "however , performing the simultaneous fit using a single source to model the emission from the region around this source gives a centroid offset by about 2@xmath8from the _ xmm - newton_position known to arcsecond accuracy ; a result that is not compatible with the expected error .",
    "since , as mentioned above , we know of one source detected by isgrithat was active over the course of the first part of 2004 , namely saxj1747.02853 , we included it and fixed its position .",

    "it is therefore compatible with either of these sources .",
    "indeed , even if its associated positional uncertainty of 0@xmath8.75 is somewhat smaller than the offset , we expect this pslato be slightly overestimated when fitting multiple close sources ( i.e. within the full width of the psf ) .",
    "for example , in the case of the known source 1a1742294 , the measured offset can be 2030% times larger than the psla .",

    "for this reason we adopt a final error radius for the central source ( and for 1e1743.12853 that has a comparable signal - to - noise ratio ) of 1@xmath8 , about 30% larger than the pslavalue of 0@xmath8.75 derived from the relation given by gros et al .",

    "however , we notice that the emission that seems to bridge the sources labelled sgra@xmath0and 1e1743.12843 at low - energy persists at higher energies such that in the 56 to 85  @xmath1 range , the emission from the region seems to be centered between the two sources . this is a surprising result that we can not readily interpret .",
    "an investigation of this based on a comparison of the emission detected by ibis / isgriwith the 20  @xmath25 radio map , the 6.4  @xmath1 fe line - emission contours and the cs map of the region raises several other interesting questions .",

    "this limit is calculated taking into account corrections derived from the probability of photoelectric interaction at 511  @xmath1 in the isgridetector ( 34% ) and the fact that we have selected events using a band corresponding to 78% of line flux .",

    "of course , this difficulty dissipates as integration radius decreases since fewer components are summed together .",
    "second , we have no _ a priori _ knowledge of the nature of the emission detected as igrj174562901and therefore do not know whether the comparison with the total x - rayspectrum from a region that roughly corresponds to isgri s angular resolution is an appropriate one . keeping these caveats in mind",
    ", we justify this type of comparison by pointing to the fact that the source coincident with the gc , detected by _ integral_as what appears to be a point - source , must undoubtedly contribute to the x - rayspectrum from the region that corresponds to its spatial extent .",
    "the spectral transition from 10 to 20  @xmath1 must be more or less continuous and therefore we expect the high - energy component present in the x - rayspectrum and from which igrj174562901arises , to stand out beyond the thermally dominated spectrum at around 20  @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , a large @xmath65 value should not be surprising for it points to the fact that the emission in the range from 1 to 3  @xmath1 is not modelled properly for the reason mentioned above . our aims in this section",

    "we discuss a number of scenarios in an attempt to identify the source of the emission detected by _",
    "integral_and apparently centered on sgra@xmath0 .",
    "the hot component at 68  @xmath1 of the two - temperature plasma at the gc is well known and its presence is viewed by many as problematic in terms of it being confined given the escape velocity of a hydrogen plasma at that temperature or of the heating mechanisms that would be required to supply energy to the plasma were it not confined .",
    "it is interesting to ask what is this hot plasma s extrapolated flux at energies between 2030  @xmath1 in order to assess its possible contribution to the flux detected from the central arcminutes . in [ s : spectrum ] we showed that although the hot plasma component totally dominates the spectrum in the range from 2 to 5  @xmath1 , its contribution to the overall flux is several times less than that of the power - law in the 2030  @xmath1 range and drops to a negligible level with respect to the power - law component in the range 3040  @xmath1 .",
    "these estimates are based on the best fit value for the temperature of 6.5  @xmath1 and clearly the contribution increases somewhat if we fix the temperature at 8  @xmath1 .",
    "nonetheless this hot plasma can only provide a very small fraction of the emission detected from the direction of the gcby _ integral _ , and this solely in the first band , from 20 to 30  @xmath1 .",
    "a large number of x - raytransients have been detected in the neighbourhood of sgra@xmath0 in the last few years @xcite .",
    "in fact , there even appears to be an over - abundance of such sources near the gcwhere four x - raybinaries lie within 1  @xmath107 ( 25@xmath26 ) of sgra@xmath0@xcite .",
    "these sources , observed at luminosities between @xmath29 and @xmath32 ergs@xmath13 in the 210  @xmath1 range , are not particularly bright since these luminosities are intermediate between quiescence and outburst . in the paragraphs that follow we attempt to estimate the effect of such sources on the flux of igrj174562901 in the 20120  @xmath1 range .",
    "we restrict ourselves to this energy range because it is here that we have the best estimate of flux from the isgridata .",
    "the gcsource igrj174562901shows very little variability and hence its persistant quality demonstrates that it is probably not heavily influenced by the sometimes radical brightening of an individual x - raytransient as it moves from quiesence to outburst .",
    "furthermore , the high detection significance in the 2040  @xmath1 band permits an accurate determination of the emission centroid and yields an uncertainty of about 1@xmath8 . for this reason",
    ", we do not consider transients that lie outside the error radius of igrj174562901but turn our investigation to the 4 transients detected by _",
    "chandra_within 30@xmath26of the central bh@xcite and pay particular attention to the remarkable lmxblocated just 3@xmath26south of sgra@xmath0@xcite .",
    "this transient , cxogcj174540.0290031 , was very bright during both epochs of the multiwavelength campaign , the only period for which we have contemporaneous x - rayand _ integral_data , and will therefore be the main focus of the discussion .",
    "the four transients detected within 30@xmath26of sgra@xmath0are also the hardest of the seven transients discussed by muno et al .",
    "( 2005a ) .",

    "we plotted the light curve for igrj174562901rebinned in 2 week segments on the same time line .",

    "figure[f : transients ] shows these light curves where that of igrj174562901appears as the top most .",
    "the flux is in units of ph@xmath15s@xmath13and the time is in modified julian days .",
    "the observation cycles are clearly depicted by the isgrilight curve where each data subset corresponds to a season , the first one being spring 2003 and the last , fall 2004 .",

    "furthermore , it is difficult to draw conclusions from the general comparison with the flux levels of the four hardest _ chandra_transients shown in figure[f : transients ] .",
    "we will now take a closer look at the unusual transient cxogcj174540.0290031 .",
    "this source was discovered during the 2004 july _",
    "chandra_observations of the gc @xcite and was also seen to be active throughout both epochs of the multiwavelenth campaign of 2004 , reaching its peak x - raybrightness in april .",

    "integral_flux , we used the spectral parameters derived from the contemporaneous _ xmm - newton_observations and presented in porquet et al .",
    "2005 . taking a photon index of @xmath31=1.6 and 210  @xmath1 flux normalization of 1.3@xmath2@xmath111erg@xmath15s@xmath13we",
    "find that the extrapolated 20120  @xmath1 luminosity is about 5@xmath2@xmath112ergs@xmath13 .",
    "for an index @xmath31=1.98 and flux @xmath66=1.8@xmath2@xmath111erg@xmath15s@xmath13 , we get an extrapolated luminosity of 2.5@xmath2@xmath112ergs@xmath13 .",
    "the largest of these values amounts to about one tenth of the derived luminosity of igrj174562901 and is probably still over - estimated given that the spectrum of a lmxbin outburst is rarely a pure power - law above energies @xmath16100  @xmath1 .",
    "a more realistic description would be a comptonization model where the seed photons are boosted to higher energies as they encounter fast thermal electrons in the hot ( 3050  @xmath1 ) corona .",
    "in this case , the contribution in the isgriband would very likely be even less than the above extrapolations . according to this simple estimate",
    ", ten sources similar to cxogcj174540.0290031 in luminosity and spectral index within a few arcminutes of sgra@xmath0would have to be active more or less continuously to account for the 20120 luminosity of igrj174562901 .",
    "of course , the flux could be due to a substantially larger number of dim and hard sources that have until now evaded detection by _",
    "chandra_and _ xmm - newton_and that are clustered around sgra@xmath0 .",
    "this however , is an unlikely scenario .",
    "we have considered and tried to quantify the effect of the known x - raytransients located within 30@xmath26of sgra@xmath0on the isgricount rate .",
    "we find that the flux of igrj174562901can not be explained by the contribution of transients located very close to the central bh , and that their contribution appears to be negligeable over the range from 20 to 120  @xmath1 .",
    "our campaign to search for correlated variability in the x - rayand soft @xmath17-rayflux from the central bhwas inconclusive due to _ integral_data gaps during the sgra@xmath0flares . of the two factor-40 flares that occured on 2004 march 31 and august 31 , the first was somewhat harder with a photon index of @xmath31=1.52 compared to @xmath31=1.87 for the second flare @xcite . by extrapolating the flux of the hardest flare to the 2030  @xmath1 energy band we find that its contribution to the isgricount rate using an average effective area in this band of 650  @xmath113 should be about 0.05  @xmath51 . taking a peak flare flux equivalent to twice the average gives 0.1  @xmath51 and so since igrj174562901 s observed isgricount rate in this range is around 0.4  @xmath51 we would expect a rise of @xmath1625% due to the flare . based on these simple assumptions , this type of event would therefore not be detectable by isgri , and for the same reason , can not explain the emission seen as igrj174562901 .",
    "furthermore , the derived luminosity of the gcsource of around 5@xmath2@xmath12ergs@xmath13 , can not result directly from the integration of successive flares from the central black hole .",
    "the flares occur on average once per day and have typical luminosities of @xmath12ergs@xmath13for durations of a few thousand seconds .",
    "if the flares last 3 to 20  @xmath41 , even if they all reached peak luminosities of around @xmath32ergs@xmath13 , this would still not be enough to make up the persistant luminosity of igrj174562901 .",
    "this is not to say , that the acceleration of particles to very high lorentz factors during such a flare could not lead to a secondary high - energy emission that would not be detected by x - rayinstruments but that would contribute to the flux in the range 20400  @xmath1 .",
    "the detection of a persistant source up to about 120  @xmath1 compatible with the position of the central bhraises the very interesting possibility that it may be related to the tev source detected from the same region by _",
    "these observations lend crucial support to the idea that acceleration of particles to very high energies is taking place at the gc@xcite . furthermore ,",
    "all of them agree on the apparent absence of variability from the central source .",
    "the _ hess_collaboration has been particularly successful at determining the high - energy properties of this source detected over two epochs , 2003 june - july and 2003 july - august , and together with the earlier 30  @xmath36 to 10  @xmath20 _ egret_detection of the continuum source 3egj17462851 within 1@xmath18of the nucleus @xcite , this tev detection provides some evidence of hadronic acceleration at the gc , either by sgra@xmath0itself , within the shocked shell of an snr , such as sgraeastor by some other mechanism inlcuding the interaction of non - thermal filaments with dense molecular environments .",
    "protons could be accelerated , either via @xmath114 order fermi acceleration at a shock , or via stochastic acceleration ( a @xmath115 order fermi process ) in a turbulent magnetic field , and then scatter with ambient protons to produce pions .",
    "the @xmath116 s subsequently decay into 2@xmath17-rays , whereas the @xmath117 s and @xmath118 s initiate a muon , electron , positron , and neutrino cascade ( see e.g. , markoff , melia & sarcevic 1997,1999 ) . some evidence for a pion origin of the @xmath17-raysis provided directly by the _ egret_spectrum , which exhibits a clear break at @xmath161  @xmath20 , and therefore can not be fit by a single power law . instead",
    ", this break is usually attributed to the rest - frame energy of pion - decay photons .",
    "the secondary electrons and positrons produced by the charged pions in concert with the @xmath116-decay photons , are capable of producing their own @xmath17-rayemission via bremsstrahlung and compton scattering .",
    "for example , if these leptons build up to a steady - state distribution balanced by bremsstrahlung and coulomb losses , they naturally account for the lowest energy _",
    "this is rather important because the pion decays link the lepton and photon generation rates , so the bremsstrahlung and pion - decay photon emissivities are tightly correlated .",
    "the possibility that the relativistic protons may be accelerated close to sgra@xmath0was first explored by markoff , melia & sarcevic ( 1997 , 1999 ) , who concluded that the maximum attainable energy is of the order of 4@xmath2@xmath119  @xmath21 . however , there appear to be two principal reasons why the @xmath120 scatterings that lead to pionic @xmath17-rayemission probably do not occur in the acceleration zone itself .",
    "first , the ensuing particle cascade would produce a copious supply of energetic leptons that , in the presence of the inferred @xmath16110  @xmath121 magnetic field for this source , would greatly exceed sgra@xmath0 s observed radio flux .",
    "second , the lack of variability in the data from kev to tev energies , argues against a compact point - source like sgra@xmath0 .",
    "the more recent analysis of proton acceleration within sgra@xmath0(liu , petrosian & melia 2004 ; liu , melia & petrosian 2005 ) has shown that these relativistic particles actually diffuse to distances @xmath1623  @xmath107 away from the acceleration site before scattering with the ambient protons , and therefore the ensuing leptonic cascade does not overproduce emission at longer wavelengths having left the region where the magnetic fields are very strong . in support of this picture , wherein the relativistic particles responsible for the _ hess_and _ integral_source are accelerated near sgra@xmath0 , it is worth noting that the mechanism responsible for accelerating the electrons required to account for sgra@xmath0 s 7  @xmath122 emissivity , also accelerates protons in the system . these protons",
    "do not radiate as efficiently as electrons and therefore diffuse away from the acceleration site .",
    "the electron acceleration rate implied by the radio measurements also corresponds to the right @xmath16tev luminosity from the protons flooding the region surrounding the black hole to match the _ hess_measurements .",
    "in addition , the time required for these particles to diffuse outwards is @xmath16@xmath123@xmath124 years , which would argue against any rapid variability in the tev @xmath17-rayemission , as observed .",
    "thus , although both the _ hess_and _ integral_gcsources appear to be slightly extended , the origin of the particles responsible for the broad band spectrum of the nuclear region may ultimately still be sgra@xmath0 .",
    "the supernova renmant sgraeastwhose centroid is located 50@xmath26from sgra@xmath0 , is another likely source of @xmath17-raysnear the gc(see melia & falcke 2001 ) .",
    "it is a member of a class of remnants detected at 1720  @xmath125 ( the transition of oh maser emission ) , a signature of shocks produced at the interface between supersonic outflow and the dense molecular cloud environments with which they interact .",
    "it has already been shown @xcite that sgraeastis capable of producing the observed @xmath17-rayluminosity detected by _",
    "egret_once the unusually - high ambient particle density ( @xmath126@xmath127  @xmath128 ) and strong magnetic field ( @xmath1260.10.2  @xmath39 ) are taken into account . in a thorough examination of the particle acceleration and energetics in this source , crocker et al .",
    "( 2005 ) demonstrated that sgraeastcould very well also be the source of the tev spectrum measured by _",
    "hess_. one should note , however , that the _ egret_and _ hess_sources are probably not coincident .",
    "the centroid of the _ egret_emission @xcite appears to be significantly displaced away from sgra@xmath0 , whereas the tev source lies within @xmath161@xmath8 .",
    "in addition , although the _ egret_and _",
    "hess_spectral indices are similar ( @xmath162.2 ) , the corresponding fluxes at gev and tev energies differ by over an order of magnitude .",
    "it appears that the _ egret_source must cutoff well below the tev range suggesting , together with the relative spatial displacement of the two sources , that we must be dealing with at least two separate regions of @xmath17-rayemissivity .",
    "sgraeastmay in fact be a very good candidate as the source of the emission detected by _",
    "hess_at the galactic center .",
    "this composite snrin its radiative phase has several observational characteristics akin to supernovae in molecular clouds or dense environments : a bright radio shell with a strong non - thermal synchrotron component , x - rayemission from the compact central core dominated by the hot thermal plasma component and a strong he - like 6.7  @xmath1 fe emission line .",
    "it shares some of these features with g0.9 + 0.1 that was recently confirmed as a source of tev radiation by the _ hess_collaboration @xcite and its local environment make it a good candidate for powerful particle acceleration .",
    "there is one important distinction between g0.9 + 0.1 and sgraeasthowever ; the compact core of g0.9 + 0.1 is known to be a pwnfor which is central pulsar has been detected @xcite and that has a hard , non - thermal x - rayemission .",
    "the x - raycore of sgraeastis so highly dominated by thermal emission that non - thermal x - rayemission does not even seem to be present .",
    "we know however , that such behaviour is not unexpected for snrin molecular clouds or dense environments @xcite .",
    "moreover , there is preliminary evidence that several of the new _ hess _ sources detected during the galactic plane scan might be snrwith weak x - rayemission @xcite .",
    "the isgriinstrument on the _ integral_satellite has detected with a high significance hard x - rayand soft @xmath17-rayemission centered within 1@xmath8of the galactic nucleus .",
    "we have analyzed two years of _ integral_observations and thoroughly examined this data over the energy range from 20 to 400  @xmath1 . combining these results with _ xmm - newton_data in the energy range from 1 to 10  @xmath1 , we have found that this emission can not be attributed to the hot thermal plasma in the sagittarius complex , it can not be explained by the integrated flux from known x - raytransients near the central black hole , and it can not be the simple extrapolation of the x - rayflux of flares from sgra@xmath0 .",
    "the fact that igrj174562901is comparable in brightness to the well known binary system 1e1743.12853 in the 2040  @xmath1 range but that unlike this source it does not produce the large x - rayflux that makes 1e1743.12853 so incredibly conspicuous in the soft x - rayband suggests that igrj174562901is not point - like .",
    "in addition , the fact that jem - x , with its @xmath163@xmath8angular resolution , easily detects the known binaries in the region including 1e1743.12853 but does not see any emission from the gcalso suggests that the nature of igrj174562901is not point - like .",
    "these considerations lead us to conclude that igrj174562901is a compact diffuse emission region a few arcminutes in size and where astrophysical processes give rise to thermal and non - thermal emission .",
    "the power of investigation and discovery at our disposal through combining the use of very high resolution x - rayinstruments like _ xmm - newton_and _ chandra _ , radio observatories like the vla , and the new generation of @xmath17-raytelescopes like _ integral_and _ hess_at the highest energies is astounding . to be faced with data from observations that can not be readily explained nor understood is stimulating and inspiring .",
    "this is the kind of puzzle that we face in trying to understand the nature of the emission detected from the direction of the galactic nucleus with _",
    "hess_.    finally , in section[s : mosaic ] we discussed the 2040  @xmath1 morphology of the emission near the gcand due to the very long effective exposure of 4.7  @xmath40 , the maps in the different energy bands revealed that 1 ) as the brighter and softer sources igrj174562901and 1e1743.12853 become fainter with increasing energy , a hard but dim emission about 6@xmath8from sgra@xmath0 in the direction of positive longitudes appears , and 2 ) that the spectral index of this emission is quite hard and apparently qualitatively similar to that of igrj174752822 ( sgrb2 ) .",
    "this new source of soft @xmath17-rayscould well be closely related to the unidentified _",
