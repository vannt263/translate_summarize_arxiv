    "one of the biggest mysteries in physics has been the apparent discrepancy between classical and quantum theories . this is because quantum theory involves many elements not seen in classical physics , such as wave / particle duality , superposition , entanglement , nonlocality etc .",
    "@xcite . there is also a historical reason for this confusion , because quantum theory was developed in the early twentieth century , and its descriptions of certain behaviors were presumed to replace many previously considered classical behaviors .",
    "this explains why one of the largest efforts in the theoretical physics research community is now being directed toward trying to come up with a quantum version of classical theory , namely , gravitation @xcite . however , contradictory to the common perception , the classical aspect is also an integral part of quantum theory .",
    "that is , measurement in quantum theory is provided in classical space - time through the eigenvalue outcome .",
    "this view is also consistent with the current difficulty of coming up with a quantum theory of gravity regardless of decades of effort .    in @xcite ,",
    "there has been a suggestion that reality ought to be subjective .",
    "this suggestion has been drawn from the argument of consciousness , that is , that only in the case of consciousness are the object and the observer the same .",
    "this phenomenon is unique , considering the observation or measurement results from the relative difference between the object being observed and the observer .",
    "therefore , it has been suggested that because of consciousness , one should stop considering the observer and the object as separate entities .",
    "in @xcite , more detailed argument was provided as to what it means that the observer and the object are inseparable .",
    "it was argued that given equally accessible microstates , the observer s freely chosen will corresponds to the reality : @xmath2 note that there have been a number of discussions suggesting the relation between entropy and gravity @xcite .",
    "therefore , if we assume the entropy in terms of the observer s choice , as in @xcite , this implies the relation of gravity or einstein s equation to ( [ reality ] ) .",
    "recently , @xcite has introduced the concept of cyclical time with consciousness . in the cyclical model ( see @xcite for a review ) , time proceeds from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , from @xmath1 to @xmath3 , from @xmath3 to @xmath4 etc . , and at a certain @xmath5 , @xmath6 proceeds back to @xmath0 ( figure [ cycle ] ) . in particular , cyclical time",
    "was discussed in terms of self - reference in logic and self - observation in consciousness .",
    "it was argued that a paradoxical or noncomputable element may be removed in the cyclical model . in the following",
    ", self - observation will be discussed in terms of cyclical time , particularly using both classical and quantum elements .     to @xmath1 , from @xmath1 to @xmath3 , etc .",
    "but at some @xmath7 , @xmath6 proceeds back to @xmath0 .",
    "the figure shows the simplest case , where @xmath8 .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "the cyclical time model may seem strange and counterintuitive , since we are used to time moving forward only ; thus , it seems strange that time circulates .",
    "nevertheless , it will be illustrated that this cyclical model is in fact consistent not only in explaining the experience of time but also in terms of consistency between classical and quantum theories .",
    "the argument in @xcite was that classical probability theory may be considered equivalent to quantum theory , except for the continuity part .",
    "indeed , when the axioms of classical theory are compared with the axioms of quantum theory , the difference between the two is the extra continuity axiom in quantum theory .",
    "meanwhile , @xcite argued that one can exploit this idea such that classical probability theory can be considered to involve a classical choice made by the observer , while continuity is associated with the choice of quantum reference frame , an observable .",
    "below , it will be discussed more explicitly what is meant by a classical choice made by the observer accompanied by continuity , or a dirac - type negative sea in the cyclical model .",
    "-direction , and the classical reference frame @xmath9 is also positioned similarly .",
    "so ( i ) the observer chooses @xmath10 with the classical vector @xmath9 , where time proceeds from @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "and ( ii ) in the cyclical time model , time @xmath1 then proceeds back to @xmath0 , while the quantum reference frame @xmath11 evolves to equate itself with @xmath9 .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    on the other hand , @xcite showed that the cyclical model can be adopted in association with consciousness . before moving on to discuss the cyclical model ,",
    "let us first review self - observation in linear time .",
    "in general , quantum measurement involves a state vector and a reference frame . in the schrdinger picture",
    ", it would be the state vector that is rotated , and in the case of the heisenberg picture , the reference frame is rotated counterclockwise . in both cases , the observation would be the same .    in the case of self - observation ,",
    "the state vector , the object , is the same as the reference frame , or the observable . in that case , in the schrdinger picture , the reference frame",
    "would be rotated , whereas in the heisenberg picture , the reference frame would be rotated counterclockwise by the same amount .",
    "the two are not generally equivalent @xcite .",
    "therefore , self - observation is not computable in a linear time model .",
    "a cyclical model may be initially considered with a reference frame , a classical one .",
    "that is , the vector is defined in classical space - time rather than in complex hilbert space , as in quantum theory .",
    "one could imagine this classical vector as follows : when one performs a measurement of a quantum state , the state vector and the observable , or the reference frame , are defined in complex vector space .",
    "however , in order to carry out the actual measurement , the objects and thereference frame are needed not only in quantum space but also in classical space as well ( figure [ sea ] ) .",
    "in particular , in order to discuss self - observation in the cyclical model , the objects in quantum and classical spaces are not needed , but only the reference frames , that is to say , the classical reference frame @xmath9 and the quantum reference frame @xmath11 . from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , the classical reference frame @xmath9 points at @xmath10 ( figure [ time ] ( i ) ) .",
    "a cyclical model is now considered where @xmath1 proceeds back to @xmath0 . in this case",
    ", the quantum reference frame @xmath11 evolves from 0 to @xmath10 , such that it aligns itself with the classical reference frame @xmath9 ( figure [ time ] ( ii ) ) .",
    "the above argument may be understood as follows .",
    "when the observer makes a choice of @xmath10 , it is done in classical space . however , understanding or being aware of the choice occurs in the quantum domain . in other words , from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , the observer observes something to be at @xmath10 , that is , the observer chooses @xmath10 . from @xmath1 to @xmath0 , that something was the observer s own reference frame .",
    "in this section , we wish to discuss how small time cycles relate to the large cycle in the cyclical model ( figure [ time1 ] ) .",
    "let us begin with a quantum reference frame @xmath11 and the classical reference frame @xmath9 , which is represented in classical space equivalent to the @xmath12-direction of the bloch sphere of a qubit .",
    "as before , time moves forward , and the classical choice made is @xmath13 ; the quantum reference frame also evolves to equate itself with @xmath13 but with time moving backwards .",
    "that would be the first case .",
    "the second small cycle may be considered with the classical vector @xmath9 pointing at @xmath14 with time moving forward .",
    "the reference frame @xmath11 evolves backward in time so that it equates itself with the classical reference frame at @xmath14 ( figure [ cyclic2 ] ( i ) ) .",
    "is positioned at @xmath13 with time moving forward , and then the quantum reference frame equates itself with the classical vector at @xmath13 with time circulating back , which completes the first small cycle",
    ". then the vector @xmath9 chooses @xmath14 with time moving forward , and eventually , the quantum reference frame equates itself with @xmath9 with time circulating back , which completes the second small cycle .",
    "( ii ) a large time cycle is achieved with the evolution of another quantum reference frame , @xmath15 , to equate itself with @xmath9 .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    let us now consider a larger cycle with the introduction of another quantum reference frame , @xmath15 , initially pointing in the @xmath12-direction .",
    "the larger cycle is accomplished with the evolution of @xmath15 to equate itself with @xmath9 at @xmath16 ( figure [ cyclic2 ] ( ii ) ) . in order to further elaborate on the relation between small and large cycles ,",
    "let us consider a special case where @xmath17 that is , the observer is not choosing anything but is only experiencing time evolution in a cyclical manner .",
    "in such a case , the observer is conscious of time in small cycles as well as in a larger time cycle .",
    "therefore , the experience of time evolution , such as seconds ( small cycle ) and minutes ( large cycle ) occurs as the observer perceives these cycles . at the fundamental level",
    ", this subjective nature of time may be stated as follows : @xmath18 the experience of time is perceived by a dirac - type negative sea or consciousness .",
    "in this paper , we have discussed the relation between classical choice and the continuous or infinite semantics of the choice in terms of quantum theory . in particular , it is noted that the cyclical model is consistent with our previous discussion @xcite on subjective reality and universal grammar , which argues that all languages have a universal structure that is not learned but is innate in human nature @xcite .",
    "that is , based on the argument presented in this paper , the innateness or universal grammar may be related to this continuous or infinite part associated with formal language , represented through the finite classical choice made by the observer .",
    "we have also argued that the association of infinity or continuity with classical choice provides a more specific description of ongoing efforts in the subjective model , particularly regarding the subjective nature of time .",
    "we have shown the connection of consciousness with time in a way such that the most fundamental experience of consciousness is in fact associated with time .",
    "it is interesting to note the relation between small and large cycles of time using the proposed subjective model .",
