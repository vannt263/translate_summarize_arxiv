    "one can observe that the amplitude ( partition function ) can be represented as a _ matrix _ product @xmath29 matrix elements @xmath30 depend on a number of distinct ways to connect geometric spatial states at times @xmath2 and @xmath31 .",

    "we are forced to use numerical methods as a tool to obtain physical information about the system .",
    "the tools we use are monte carlo simulations . in the cdt model",
    "a very important ingredient of the theory becomes the entropy of configurations . for a fixed set of @xmath32",
    "the number of space - time configurations grows exponentially like @xmath33 the critical parameter @xmath34 depends on @xmath24 and @xmath26 , which means that the parameter @xmath26 , which originally had a geometric origin , plays the role of an independent coupling constant .",

    "this reduces the parameter space of the model to a set of two bare coupling constants @xmath24 and @xmath26 . in our simulations",
    "we choose periodic boundary conditions , which on the one hand frees us from the necessity to define initial and final geometries , but on the other hand does not change the physical picture , as will become clear below .      using the monte carlo program",
    "we perform a random walk in the space of configurations using 7 elementary local _ moves _ , which preserve the ( local and global ) topological restrictions on a manifold .",
    "the probability to perform a particular move is obtained by the detailed balance condition .",
    "this is a markov process with a stationary limiting distribution satisfying @xmath39 configurations separated by a large number of moves are _ statistically independent _ and the probability to obtain a particular configuration is given by the limiting distribution .",

    "it is the distribution of a three - volume @xmath40 as a function of discrete time @xmath2 .",
    "depending on the position in the @xmath41 plane our system appears to be in three physically distinct phases @xcite characterized by different behaviour of @xmath40 .    on the fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] we show a sample distribution of the three - volume @xmath40 for one typical configuration in phases a , b and c. phase a is characterized be a sequence of slices @xmath40 with no correlation between the states at neighbouring times . in phase",
    "b the time dependence of the distribution is squeezed to one time value ( one may view it as a spontaneous compactification of the time variable ) . for other times",
    "the volume is close to minimal .",
    "it can not be completely zero , because we choose periodic boundary conditions and do not allow the volume to vanish at any fixed time @xmath2 .",
    "most interesting from a physical point of view is the c phase .",
    "the volume profile looks like a fluctuation superimposed over a regular classical background ( the red line on the plot ) .",
    "a typical configuration consists of a central _ blob _ and a _ stalk _ of cut - off size resulting again from our choice of boundary conditions ( periodicity in time ) .",
    "the red line is the average distribution over many configurations with the same volume .",
    "we can compare distributions for a sequence of volumes ( fig .",
    "[ fix ] ) and we find a universal scaling behaviour in the variable @xmath42 , with hausdorff dimension @xmath43 .",
    "the plot illustrates the universality of the volume distribution for the rescaled observable @xmath44 plotted vs. @xmath45 .",
    "we expect the averaged scaled distribution to be volume - independent . this distribution can be interpreted as a semi - classical limiting distribution of volume",
    ". note that in our numerical experiments it is obtained by integrating out all other degrees of freedom ( details of the geometry ) except the spatial volume @xmath40 .",
    "the analysis shows that the averaged geometry scales in a way consistent with dimension four .",
    "although this result may appear trivial , it is definitely not , since the distribution is obtained as the effect of a very delicate balance between the entropy of configurations and the physical action . in earlier studies , where causality was not imposed ,",
    "typical geometries dominating the quantum amplitude had either @xmath46 ( branched polymer phase ) or @xmath47 ( collapsed phase ) .",
    "we can analyze further the properties of the distribution and try to fit the limiting curve by an analytic formula .",
    "the effect of the analysis is presented on the fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] , together with the fit .",
    "the analytic form of the fit suggests that the observed geometry can be interpreted as the volume dependence inside a four - dimensional ball , in this case the variable @xmath2 plays the role of the azimuthal angle .",
    "this would indicate that in phase c we see the appearance of a spherical four - dimensional de sitter geometry .",
    "the geometric properties can be analyzed using other observables .",
    "a useful example is that of the spectral dimension @xmath48 . to measure this quantity",
    "we analyze the return probability in the diffusion process on the geometry , as a function of the diffusion time @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "if the geometry was regular we would expect @xmath50 with a constant @xmath51 .",
    "the figure shows the observed behaviour of @xmath48 obtained by averaging over many starting points of the diffusion process and over many configurations .    the plot on fig .",
    "[ fig04 ] shows that @xmath48 is not a constant , but depends on @xmath49 suggesting a scale dependence of the effective geometry , ranging between two at short scales and four at large scales .",
    "this illustrates the quantum character of geometry .",
    "a similar property was discovered in other approaches to quantum gravity ( c.f .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the geometry presented above was measured at a particular point on the @xmath41 plane .",
    "when the values of the bare coupling constants are changed inside phase c , the qualitative behaviour remains the same , up to a finite change in the scale .",
    "we are particularly interested in the critical behaviour near phase transitions .",
    "the qualitative behaviour of the phase structure of cdt was found to have strong similarity to the phase structure predicted by hoava - lifschitz gravity ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the simplest check of the analogy was to measure the order of the phase transitions , which we found to be first - order for the a - c transition and second order for the b - c transition @xcite .",
    "the regular semi - classical distribution of spatial volume observed in phase c ( de sitter phase ) suggests that it reproduces a saddle point of some effective action of the spatial volume @xmath52 or , equivalently , of the scale factor @xmath53 . a natural candidate for such an action",
    "is the mini - superspace action @xmath54 where @xmath2 takes the continuum value and @xmath55 plays the role of lagrange multiplier , necessary to fix the total volume to some target volume @xmath56 @xmath57 here @xmath58 sets the scale in the time direction . in a discrete setup",
    "we may expect this action to take the discretized form @xmath59 although it could have a more complicated form . here",
    "@xmath60 .",
    "measuring the covariance matrix of volume fluctuations around the semi - classical distribution and inverting this matrix we can determine the matrix of second derivatives of the effective action , assuming that higher - order terms ( higher than second order in fluctuations ) can be neglected .",
    "this method was successfully applied in @xcite .",
    "indeed the form ( 10 ) of the effective action was confirmed , at least in the range of large volumes , permitting us to determine the physical parameters @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the parameter @xmath62 was particularly difficult to measure , since the corresponding term in the action ( after differentiating it twice ) falls off very fast with the spatial volume .",
    "on the other hand , small volumes can be expected to be ( and are in fact ) very sensitive to finite - size effects and lattice artefacts .",
    "the numerical experiment described above produces values of the physical parameters @xmath63 as functions of the bare couplings @xmath41 .",
    "these physical parameters have a direct interpretation in terms of the gravitational constant @xmath64 ( up to the dimensionful parameters @xmath65 and @xmath5 ) .",
    "from a practical point of view the determination of these parameters becomes more difficult near the phase transitions , where we observe a critical slowing - down and large finite - size effects .",
    "as we observed , the neighbourhood of the phase transitions is particularly interesting from a physical point of view .",
    "approaching these lines we see that the parameter @xmath66 ( or @xmath67 ) @xcite , which can be interpreted as the limit where the lattice spacing approaches zero . in this limit",
    "we may hope to observe genuine quantum effects of gravity .",
    "the form of the effective action ( 10 ) suggests a formal decomposition of the quantum amplitude ( 4 ) in the simplified form @xmath68 where we have introduced the _ effective _ projection operators @xmath69 on the space of states with a fixed volume @xmath10 .",
    "the projection operators behave as genuine projection operators on a single state @xmath70 .",
    "they can be used to study the properties of the cdt geometry , assuming that the elements of the transfer matrix @xmath71 in ( 4 ) depend only on volume .",
    "we can check to what extent this is true .    in the proposed approach @xcite we determine directly the elements @xmath72 using numerical simulations of periodic systems with very small time extent .",
    "the method is based on the observation that terms in the sum ( 11 ) have the interpretation ( up to a normalization ) of the probability to measure a particular sequence of volumes . for a system with periodicity 2 and periodic boundary conditions @xmath73 by measuring the number of times a particular set",
    "@xmath74 appears in the simulation we determine the matrix element @xmath75 . in practice",
    "the method is more complicated , because we also want to study a particular range of @xmath74 .",
    "details of the method are explained in @xcite .    on the fig .",
    "[ fig06 ] we show the logarithm of the transfer matrix , obtained by gluing together the results of measurements at the neighbouring ranges of volume . on the plot",
    "we see the gaussian behaviour of the off - diagonal _ kinetic _ term and the diagonal _ potential _ terms .",
    "the kinetic term corresponds to the first line in ( 10 ) and the potential term to the second line .",
    "we can easily measure the parameters of the effective action and find consistency with the values determined by the indirect method described before .",
    "the advantage of the new approach is a much smaller numerical error and at the same time a much shorter computer time needed to perform the measurements .",
    "the presented plot corresponds to one particular point on the @xmath41 plane , well inside the de sitter phase .",
    "we are currently measuring the behaviour of physical parameters @xmath63 in the whole range of the c ( de sitter ) phase , in particular near the phase transitions .",
    "preliminary results confirm that @xmath66 at the a - c transition and inside the a phase and indicate that @xmath76 changes sign at the b - c transition lines .",
    "details of this behaviour are crucial to determine and understand the critical behaviour near the phase transition and the critical scaling properties of the model .",
    "particularly interesting is the perspective to study the neighbourhood of the triple point , where the three phases meet .",
    "the cdt model allows us to study properties of the lattice regularized quantum theory of geometry in a wick - rotated formulation ( imaginary time ) .",
    "obvious questions about the full properties of the model under analytic continuation to real time remain open .",
    "some features of the model are however common to a formalism with real and imaginary time .",
    "one important property is the crucial role played by the entropy of configurations , an aspect which is usually not appreciated in mini - superspace - type models .",
    "our approach is based on integrating out all degrees of freedom , apart from a finite set and permits us to study the true effective model of the scale factor .",
