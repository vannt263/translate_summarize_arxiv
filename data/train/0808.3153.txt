    "determining the difference between an object stably burning hydrogen ( a main sequence star ) and an object of lower mass incapable of such stable fusion ( a brown dwarf ) is not always straightforward .",
    "although objects with main sequence spectral types of o , b , a , f , g , or k are always stars and objects with a spectral type of t are always brown dwarfs , dwarfs of type m or l comprise a mixture of stellar and substellar objects .    by definition , distinguishing a brown dwarf from a star requires knowledge that the object is not burning hydrogen in its core .",
    "there is no direct way to probe the interiors of these objects , so other techniques are required .",
    "the most common indirect method used is the `` lithium test '' ( @xcite ) .",
    "this test recognizes the fact that the temperature ( @xmath5k ; @xcite ) needed to sustain core hydrogen fusion in the lowest mass stars is only slightly higher than that needed to burn lithium ( @xmath6k ; @xcite ) .",
    "if lithium does not burn , that means hydrogen is also not being fused .",
    "fortuitously lithium , once destroyed , is not easily manufactured again in stellar interiors , so stars and brown dwarfs will never have more than their natal abundance of this element . in principle , the presence or absence of lithium in the spectrum can thus provide knowledge of inner temperatures .    in practice",
    "there are several drawbacks when applying the lithium test to m and l dwarfs :    \\(1 ) the ground - state resonance line of is located at 6708  , a portion of the spectrum where the flux is quite low for late - m and l dwarfs .",
    "the low flux levels means that large telescopes are needed for observation of the line .",
    "even then , very few late - type dwarfs are bright enough that they can be acquired at high resolution so to obtain a sizable sample of spectra , moderate resolution ( @xmath7  ) is required .",
    "fortunately , this is sufficient for measuring equivalent widths of a few   or greater provided that the signal - to - noise ratio is high .",
    "\\(2 ) as stated above , there is a @xmath8 difference between the temperatures for lithium ignition and normal hydrogen ignition . in other words ,",
    "some brown dwarfs are capable of burning lithium and for those the lithium test will fail .",
    "these higher mass brown dwarfs are unrecognizable as substellar based on this test alone .",
    "\\(3 ) a sufficient amount of time needs to elapse for the natal supply of lithium to be extinguished .",
    "the line may therefore still be present not because the object is substellar , but because it is a star too young to have fused its lithium store . in a very young , low - mass m star",
    ", lithium may still be present in the spectrum either because the core has not yet reached lithium - burning temperatures or because there has been insufficient time for convective recirculation to have destroyed all the lithium in the star and in particular all of the lithium in the photosphere ( but this recirculation is expected to be rapid compared to the other two timescales considered here ; @xcite ) . despite these potential pitfalls , @xcite has demonstrated that any object with lithium absorption and teff @xmath1 2670k is unambiguously a brown dwarf .",
    "thus if we confine our focus to objects with temperatures cooler than this , the lithium test can be applied regardless of these considerations . using the relation of optical dwarf spectral type to temperature from @xcite  @xmath9 , where ,",
    "e.g , x=0 for m0 , 9 for m9 , 10 for l0 , and 18 for l8  we find that an effective temperature of 2670k corresponds to a dwarf of optical type m8 . for the remainder of this paper",
    ", we will therefore restrict our discussion of the lithium test to dwarfs with optical types of m8 and later .",
    "\\(4 ) it is expected that the 6708-  line will disappear at very cool temperatures as lithium forms molecular species .",
    "@xcite has shown that below @xmath10k li - bearing molecules like licl and lioh begin to form .",
    "for brown dwarfs of solar age , this temperature corresponds to optical spectral types of late - l through mid - t ( see figure 7 of @xcite ) . stars of solar abundance do not exist at temperatures this low ( see figure 10 of @xcite ) , so we can safely assume that objects in this range of spectral types are all brown dwarfs .",
    "for these the lithium test is not needed .",
    "this theoretical prediction of lithium disappearance at these types should nonetheless be tested with empirical data .",
    "\\(5 ) young ( @xmath1100 myr ) brown dwarfs have radii larger than older stars and brown dwarfs of the same spectral type because they are still contracting to their final structural configuration ( @xcite ) .",
    "these young brown dwarfs are also lower in mass than stars and older brown dwarfs of the same spectral type .",
    "both the larger radius and the lower mass mean that these objects will have lower surface gravities , which should be detectable even with low - resolution spectroscopy .",
    "( see  4.1 . )",
    "lower gravity will weaken the line due to the lower atmospheric pressure , making it much harder to detect .",
    "this has been observed by @xcite in the low - gravity , early - l dwarf 2mass j01415823@xmath114633574 , which shows no line down to an equivalent width of 1  .",
    "weak is seen despite the fact that this object is believed to be a young ( 1 - 50 myr ) , low - mass ( 6 - 25 m@xmath12 ) brown dwarf and despite the fact that other brown dwarfs of similar spectral type are known that show prominent lines  such as the l0 dwarf 2mass j11544223@xmath113400390 with a equivalent width of 3  .",
    "we can test points ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) using a unique set of spectroscopic data . over the past several years",
    "we have amassed a library of optical spectra of l and t dwarfs primarily using the w.  m.  keck observatory .",
    "data from @xcite combined with new data presented in this paper now gives us a library of @xmath13150 spectra spanning the wavelength regime 6300 - 10000   and covering spectral types l0 through t8 .",
    "with such a large set of homogeneous spectra , we can better characterize the behavior of the line as a function of spectral type .",
    "moreover , this large set of spectra enables us to identify peculiar objects , particularly those with unusual spectra indicative of low gravity .",
    "as stated above , low gravity in l and t dwarfs is an indicator of youth , so these spectra also enable us to characterize the strength as a function of age .",
    "in this paper we present the newest spectra in our optical spectral library (  2 ) , analyze objects with detected h@xmath14 (  3 ) , and identify objects with low - gravity ( young ) signatures (  4 ) .",
    "we perform further analysis of the young objects (  5 ) and build statistics on the behavior of line strengths as a function of both spectral type and age (  6 ) .",
    "conclusions are given in  7 .",
    "over the past several years we have conducted keck low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris , @xcite ) observations of two different samples .",
    "the first is a color - selected sample of southern hemisphere l dwarf candidates chosen from 2mass .",
    "the second sample is a collection of late - l dwarfs , early - t dwarfs , and a few other interesting cases drawn from the literature .",
    "we present details on each sample below .      in july 2000 , one of us ( cgt ) wished to begin a parallax program for ultra - cool dwarfs using facilities at the anglo australian observatory ( aao ) . at this time ,",
    "very few l dwarfs were recognized south of dec=@xmath15 , so we performed a photometric search for l dwarf candidates using data from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass , @xcite ) .",
    "this search was performed in two steps .",
    "first , the 2mass second incremental data release ( idr2 ) point source catalog was searched for objects meeting the following criteria : @xmath16 dec @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ( where optical magnitudes are available from the usno - a ) , and @xmath21 . in order to weed out fainter objects at early - l types ,",
    "a further cut was employed to drop objects with @xmath22 if @xmath23 . to supplement this data set",
    ", we also performed on the 2mass point source working database a search for southern hemisphere data taken after 20 feb 1999 ( the cutoff date for the 2mass idr2 ) but before july 2000 .",
    "selection criteria on this set stipulated that the candidates have @xmath16 dec @xmath17 , @xmath21 , @xmath19 , @xmath24 ( where optical magnitudes are available from the usno - a ) , and @xmath25 .",
    "visual inspection of the dss , xdss , and 2mass images was used to drop objects contaminated by bright stars or galaxies , lying in nebular regions such as the lynds 134 cloud complexes , or having bright r - band counterparts on the optical plates .",
    "the latter objects are not always eliminated using the @xmath26 selection criterion because the usno - a catalog has as one of its constraints that any real object must be detected on both the blue and red plates ; as some late - type giants will be r - band only sources on the optical sky plates , these will not be included in the usno - a ( @xcite ) .",

    "there are two epochs of observation separated by nearly a year ; our 2000 aug 23 measurement of 11   equivalent width is consistent within the errors with the 2001 jul 15 measurement of 8.44   from @xcite , who have analyzed the emission properties of the @xcite sample .",

    "many published works on late - m dwarfs have discussed the utility of gravity - sensitive spectral features in discerning lower mass brown dwarfs from higher mass stars of the same temperature or spectral type . since the early days of astronomical spectroscopy , the strengths of cah , the triplet , and the neutral alkali lines have been identified as gravity sensitive and used to distinguish m giants from m dwarfs . in an m giant ,",
    "the much more distended photosphere has much lower gravity and pressure than the photosphere of an m dwarf of equivalent temperature .",
    "a similar effect makes a young , low - mass brown dwarf distinguishable from an older , higher - mass brown dwarf ( or star ) of similar temperature .",
    "specifically , two effects are at work .",
    "first , a brown dwarf younger than @xmath13100 myr will still be contracting to its final radius ( see fig .  10 of @xcite ) and will have a more distended atmosphere than an older brown dwarf of the same spectral type .",
    "second , a younger brown dwarf must necessarily have a lower mass than an older brown dwarf of the same temperature .",
    "relative to the older object , the younger one is larger and less massive and thus has a relatively lower gravity and pressure .",
    "one of the first papers to demonstrate these effects in low - mass stars and brown dwarfs , @xcite , used a weakening of the lines in pleiades late - m brown dwarf candidates to argue that these objects were true members of the cluster . @xcite",
    "also noted that pleiades brown dwarf candidates have slightly stronger vo bands than those of similarly classified field dwarfs .",
    "@xcite found that an m8.5 brown dwarf candidate in the @xmath32 ophiuchi complex exhibited calcium hydride and strengths intermediate between an m8.5 v and an m8.5 iii , whereas the strengths were much more like the m8.5 iii .",
    "@xcite discussed how the optical spectrum of a brown dwarf candidate in the taurus - auriga complex had and strengths and tio / vo ratios more similar to those of a giant while the cah strength was intermediate between an m dwarf and an m giant .",
    "later studies have continued to use these gravity - sensitive diagnostics to argue for youth in other late - type dwarfs .",
    "it is important to note here that the pleiades cluster holds a special place in the study of low - gravity effects in brown dwarf spectra because of its nearness to the sun and the extent to which its low - mass members have been scrutinized .",
    "as discussed above , not only has it been shown that substellar objects in the pleiades show such effects empirically , but also ( as we discuss below ) the pleiades cluster falls near the aforementioned upper age boundary of @xmath13100 myr where theory predicts these effects will be just discernible .",
    "the pleiades is one of the few clusters where it is possible to derive an age estimate from all three of the fundamental age indicators : the pre - main sequence turn - on , the upper main sequence turn - off , and the lithium depletion boundary ( bildsten et al . 1997 ) .",
    "we discuss each in turn .",
    "\\1 ) the pre - main sequence turn - on age for the pleiades is the most difficult of these to measure because the pleiades locus is only slightly different from the zero - age main sequence even for low - mass stars and because theoretical models do not match real cluster isochrones well at v - i @xmath33 2 ( @xcite ) , making it difficult to derive accurate pre- main sequence ages for clusters with ages @xmath34 100 myr .",
    "a reasonable pre- main sequence age estimate for the pleiades is 100 myr ( @xcite ) , but with considerable uncertainty .",
    "\\2 ) modern upper main sequence age estimates range from 77 myr ( @xcite ) for a minimal convective core overshoot parameter up to about 150 myr ( @xcite ) for a relatively large convective core overshoot parameter .",
    "the most frequently quoted upper - main sequence age is 100 myr ( @xcite ) .",
    "\\3 ) it has been claimed that an age derived from the lithium depletion boundary should be more accurate than any other cluster age estimate ( @xcite ) because there are relatively few adjustable parameters .",
    "@xcite derived a lithium depletion boundary age for the pleiades of 125 myr , with an estimated uncertainty of about 10 myr .",
    "@xcite reanalyzed the @xcite data , and suggested a lithium depletion boundary age for the pleiades of 126 - 148 myr , dependent on how the bolometric correction is handled .",
    "the following evidence from other clusters should be considered before adopting an age for the pleiades .",
    "the @xmath14 persei cluster is another where it is possible to obtain age estimates from all three methods . if the eponymous star @xmath14 per , an f supergiant , is indeed a member of the cluster and is coeval with the other stars , its location in color - magnitude diagrams places an upper limit on the age of the cluster of @xmath180 myr ( @xcite ) , as compared to the lithium depletion boundary age estimate of @xmath1390 myr ( @xcite ) . a similar tendency for the lithium depletion boundary age to be significantly older than age estimates from other methods appears to be true for other open clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "for that reason , we choose to treat the lithium depletion boundary age for the pleiades as an upper limit , and to adopt a pleiades age of 100 - 125 myr for this paper .    moving beyond the pleiades and @xmath14 persei to slightly older ages , @xcite",
    "suggest that the early - l dwarf 2masp j0345432 + 254023 may be a member of the ursa major / sirius moving group , which has an age of 400@xmath0100 myr .",
    "this l0 dwarf does not look unusual relative to the majority of other early - l dwarfs , a reassuring fact because it was chosen as the l0 optical spectroscopic standard by @xcite .",
    "@xcite further identify the objects 2massw j0030438 + 313932 ( optical l2 ) , 2massi j1204303 + 321259 ( optical l0 ) , and 2mass j15500845 + 1455180",
    "( optical l2 : ) as being potential members of the ursa major group , and none of these show spectral peculiarities ( @xcite ) .",
    "in summary , objects at ages @xmath134@xmath4 that of the pleiades have spectra in which low gravity effects are no longer discernible at the @xmath1310   resolution of our classification spectra ; conversely , objects of pleiades age show spectral hallmarks of low gravity .",
    "hence , we adopt @xmath13100 myr as the oldest age at which the signatures of low gravity can reliably detected in our spectra .",
    "the spectra of a number of field ultra - cool ( spectral types @xmath35m7 ) dwarfs from the literature have spectral morphologies that can be attibuted to low gravity .",
    "we identify another four low - gravity objects using new spectra presented in this paper .",
    "table  [ young_dwarfs ] gives this combined list of twenty low - gravity field dwarfs . for objects having optical spectral types",

    ", we provide qualitative analyses to aid in the recognition of low - gravity signatures .",
    "we feel that such `` by - eye '' assessments are , in fact , superior to classification via spectral indices because they tap the ability of the brain to consider the _ totality _ of information available in the spectra .",
    "this parallels the philosophy of william morgan , one of the pioneers of the mkk classification system ( @xcite ) , whose reasoning was described by @xcite as follows : `` morgan used the techniques of visual pattern recognition in a morphological approach to classification . in today",

    "also noticeable in the spectra of 2mass j0608@xmath112753 and sdss j0443 + 0002 is the doublet , which is weaker than in both the normal field m9 and teide 1 , and the vo bands , which are stronger than these same two comparison spectra .",

    "( these same trends hold when comparing to the later pleiad , roque 4 , in the left panel of figure  [ lowg_l0 ] . )",
    "this evidence suggests that both 2mass j0608@xmath112753 and sdss j0443 + 0002 have ages @xmath1100 myr because they have gravities comparable to or lower than that of the pleiad .",

    "the latter difference means that at i - band the primary contributes four times more flux to the composite spectrum than the secondary does .",
    "this difference in i - band flux suggests that the l0 composite spectrum is comprised of spectra differing by roughly three spectral subclasses ( e.g. , an l0 and an l3 or an m9.5 and an l2.5 ) .",
    "we have tested this by adding a standard l0 spectrum to that of a standard l3 spectrum scaled down so that it has only one - fourth the flux of the l0 in the i - band and find that the composite spectrum is only slightly different from the l0 itself . specifically , the tio bands at 7053 and 8432   are somewhat shallower in the composite than in the l0 itself , but the strength of the alkali lines , the vo bands , and the hydrides are essentially unchanged .",
    "in other words , the composite spectrum is so little different than the single l0 dwarf that its spectrum would not be labelled unusual .",
    "therefore , we can assume that the oddities seen in the composite spectrum of denis j0357@xmath114417 are indicative of oddities in the primary spectrum itself and are not induced by the composite nature of the spectrum .",

    "a similar spectral morphology to the pleiad roque 4 suggests an age estimate for 2mass j1022 + 0200 and denis j0357@xmath114417 of very roughly 100 myr .",

    "even weaker alkali lines and hydride bands , such as those seen in iras 14303@xmath111042 , are used as the gravity - dependent hallmarks of a giant spectrum .",

    "other peculiar features are the strengths of the vo bands , which are stronger than those seen in a normal m / l dwarf despite the fact that the tio bandstrengths mimic those seen in an early - l dwarf .",
    "the oxides tio and vo disappear from late - m and early - l dwarfs because of condensation . in the standard sequence ( @xcite )",
    ", tio disappears first and vo disappears at even later spectral types ( i.e. , cooler effective temperatures ) .",
    "lower gravity leads to lower atmospheric pressure .",
    "this inhibits the formation of grains , pushing condensation to cooler temperatures ( @xcite ) .",
    "the limiting cases of this phenomemon are the giant stars . at their very low gravities of log(g)@xmath380",
    ", late - m giants never reach temperatures low enough to trigger the formation of tio and vo condensates , so gaseous tio and vo still exist in their atmospheres and as absorbers in their optical spectra .",
    "( see spectrum of iras 14303@xmath111042 in figure  [ lowg_l0 ] . )",
    "2mass 0141@xmath114633 , 2mass j0241@xmath110326 , and 2mass j2213@xmath112135 fall at values of t@xmath39 where the formation of titanium - bearing condensates has already begun but where vanadium condensation has not yet been triggered . at these temperatures , low - gravity l dwarfs are very easy to spot via their weak tio bands and overly strong vo bands .    given that the spectra of 2mass j0141@xmath114633 , 2mass j0241@xmath110326 , and 2mass j2213@xmath112135 are clearly more unusual and point to a lower gravity than that of roque 25 , we can conclude that their ages are significantly younger than the 100 myr age assigned to this pleiades member .",
    "in fact , fits of the optical and near - infrared spectra of 2mass j0141@xmath114633 from @xcite indicate 1 myr @xmath1 age @xmath1 50 myr and log(g)@xmath384.0 , implying a mass of 6 @xmath40 @xmath1 m @xmath1 25 @xmath40 .",
    "this object was discovered by @xcite . as seen in figure  [ lowg_l1 ] ,",
    "the best overall match is to a field l1 dwarf , but all of the alkali lines ( , , , and ) are noticeably weaker in this object than in normal field l dwarfs , and the vo bands are more prominent than expected . in these respects",
    "its spectrum has a very strong resemblance to roque 25 , the l0 pleiad , and suggests an age for 2mass j1022 + 5825 of roughly 100 myr .    another unusual feature in the spectrum of 2mass j1022 + 5825 is its strong h@xmath14 emission line with a measured equivalent width of 128  . as @xcite show",
    ", the emission strength just two nights later had dropped to 26  .",
    "such variable emission has the potential to complicate interpretation of the gravity - sensitive features used in our analysis , especially when objects may have been spectroscopically observed on only one occasion .",
    "such emission has two mechanisms that can alter the measured strengths of lines and bands .",
    "first , as noted in late - m and l dwarf flares ( @xcite ) , emission in the cores of resonance lines can partially or totally fill in the absorption lines causing them to appear weaker than they really are .",
    "second , flux from the superheated material above the photosphere adds continuum flux , suppressing the contrast between absorption lines and bands and thereby making the lines and bands appear weaker than normal ( i.e. , it veils the features ) .",
    "fortunately such activity is not the cause of the features seen here .",
    "the first effect would amplify the appearance of low gravity via anemic alkali linestrengths , but the second effect would contradict it because it would cause the vo bandstrengths to weaken , not strengthen .",
    "hence , low gravity is still the most likely explanation for the peculiarities seen in this spectrum . in the case of 2mass j1022 + 5825 we find that the emission appears to be confined to h@xmath14 because the strengths of the alkali lines do not change appreciably between the two nights .",
    "veiling also appears not to be an issue because the vo bandstrengths are unaffected between the observations . in this case",
    "we are further reassured that the noted spectral peculiarities are caused by low gravity and not by other effects .",
    "2mass j0033@xmath111521 , discovered by @xcite and rediscovered as part of the southern l dwarf sample , is shown in the left panel of figure  [ lowg_l2 ] .",
    "its alkali lines are weaker than those of a standard early - l dwarf , the most obvious manifestation being the shallowness of the cores of the doublet at 7665 and 7699  .",
    "hydride bandstrengths are also weaker than normal , and this is particularly obvious in the cah band near 6950   and the wing - ford feh band at 9896  .",
    "two bands noticeably weak or absent from the spectrum are tio and vo , both of which are still evident in the spectra of normal early - l dwarfs in the field ; the 8432   band of tio and weak vo absorption near 7900   usually sculpt the continuum of an early - l dwarf but this is not seen in 2mass j0033@xmath111521 .",
    "we can interpret the peculiarities in this spectrum as the result of low gravity due to the weakness of the alkali lines and hydride bands .",
    "however , we note that this object does not have the strong vo bands seen in the low - gravity l0 and l1 dwarfs discussed above .",
    "if this object is truly low - gravity , then it falls at a temperature cool enough for vo condensation to have already taken place .",
    "unfortunately for low - gravity classification , the loss of gaseous oxides robs the optical spectrum of some of its most telltale low - gravity signatures .",
    "there is an additional problem at these temperatures : there are currently no firmly established , low - gravity cluster members with optical types later than l0 to use as age comparisons . in the case of 2mass j0033@xmath111521 ,",
    "its unusual features are not that anomalous when compared to a normal field l2 dwarf , and it is likely that a lower gravity object of the same class would still exhibit some vo absorption .",
    "we thus surmise that 2mass j0033@xmath111521 must lie at the old end of the predicted age range where low - gravity signatures are evident , and this gives it an age of @xmath13100 myr .",
    "g 196 - 3b was discovered by @xcite while performing a search for companions to young ( x - ray active ) , nearby k and m dwarfs .",
    "the primary , g 196 - 3a , is an m2.5 dwarf believed to have an age between 20 myr and 300 myr ( @xcite ) .",
    "2mass j2208 + 2921 was discovered by @xcite and labeled as one of only two peculiar l dwarfs known at that time . at the time of that paper , the causes for its peculiarity were not understood but an analysis of the feature strengths on a newly acquired subaru spectrum reveals that this object is probably also a low - gravity l dwarf .",
    "spectra of g 196 - 3b and 2mass j2208 + 2921 are shown in the right panel of figure  [ lowg_l2 ] . in g 196 - 3b",
    "the cores of the doublet are noticeably weaker than field l dwarfs of similar type .",
    "lines of , , and over the 7500 - 9000   range are very weak but present at this resolution .",
    "the hydride bands of cah , crh , and feh are weaker than normal .",
    "these features point to low gravity ( youth ) as the cause , and the independent age estimate from the primary confirms this . in the spectrum of 2mass j2208",
    "+ 2921 the alkali lines are all weak , most notably the cores of the doublet .",
    "the hydride bands  cah , crh , and feh  are all weak as well .",
    "although the spectrum shows only very weak absorption by tio at 8432  , the vo bands near 7400   and 7950   are obvious and slightly stronger than those seen in g 196 - 3b .",
    "nevertheless , this spectrum is very similar to that of g 196 - 3b , so we suspect that 2mass j2208 + 2921 has a similar age of @xmath13100 myr",
    ".      2mass j1615 + 4953 was discovered by @xcite , who noted possible low - gravity signatures in its optical spectrum .",
    "gl 417b was discovered by @xcite , who assigned an age of 80 - 300 myr to it based on the activity , lithium abundance , and kinematics of its g dwarf primary , gl 417a .",
    "@xcite find that gl 417b is a binary with separation of @xmath41 and magnitude differences in the hst / wfpc2 filters of @xmath42 mag and @xmath43 mag .",
    "it can be shown that the relation between @xmath44 and optical spectral type suggests that the l4.5 composite spectrum is comprised of two spectra differing by roughly 2 or 2.5 spectral subclasses ( e.g. , an l4 + l6/l6.5 or an l4.5 + l6.5/l7 ) .",
    "it can further be shown that such composite spectra differ little from that of the primary , so we can consider the peculiarities in the composite spectrum to be indicative of peculiarities in the primary spectrum alone .",
    "the spectrum of 2mass j1615 + 4953 in the left panel of figure  [ lowg_l4 ] has low signal - to - noise but the overall morphology best fits that of an l4 dwarf . a comparison to an even earlier , l3",
    "dwarf shows that 2mass j1615 + 4953 is too blue in its overall slope .",
    "we interpret this as an absence of absorption from the wings of the `` d '' doublet at 5890 and 5896  .",
    "a more detailed examination also shows that the line cores are weaker along with all of the bands of cah , crh , and feh .",
    "low gravity is most likely the cause , and we tentatively assign this object an age estimate of @xmath13100 myr based on the fact that it is more peculiar than gl 417b ( @xmath1380 - 300 myr ; see below ) .",
    "however , due to the poor signal - to - noise ratio of this spectrum we can not be completely certain that low gravity is the correct interpretation of its peculiarities .",
    "this object may prove to be an overly dusty l dwarf akin to those described in @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of gl 417b in the right panel of figure  [ lowg_l4 ] shows some slight deviations from a normal , old , field mid - l dwarf .",
    "lines of are somewhat weaker than in a field mid - l dwarf although other alkali lines of , , and are nt noticeably different in strength",
    ". the tio band at 8200   may also be somewhat weaker than normal .",
    "what is clear is that the spectrum of this fairly young object is not all that different from a much older field l4 or l5 dwarf .",
    "this supports the idea that peculiarities in the spectrum due to lower gravity are obvious only at ages @xmath1100 - 200 myr , which is the age when these brown dwarfs are expected to have reached their final radius ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is the final low - gravity spectrum illustrated here and it is the latest .",
    "the object was discovered as a byproduct of the 2mass search for red active galactic nuclei , led by b.  o.  nelson and r.  m.  cutri , and was first published in the trigonometric parallax paper of @xcite .",
    "the optical spectrum , typed as l6.5 , is plotted in figure  [ lowg_l6.5 ] along with the optical l6 and l7 standards from @xcite .",
    "the long - wavelength end of the spectrum is rather noisy , but it appears to show no wing - ford feh band at 9896  , which does not match its spectral type or the fact that the 8692   band of feh is clearly present .",
    "other than that , however , there are no other obvious spectral oddities and no reason to label this spectrum as peculiar .",
    "the reason for discussing this object here is that its near - infrared spectrum is incredibly peculiar ( @xcite ) and almost certainly the byproduct of much lower gravity .",
    "not only is the h - band portion of the spectrum markedly triangular , an indicator of low gravity , but the @xmath27 color of 2.48@xmath00.15 makes it one of the reddest l dwarfs known .",
    "so why , then , is the optical spectrum so ordinary in appearance ? unlike the earlier l dwarfs discussed above , tio and vo are no longer available to use as temperature or condensation bellwethers , the condensation of the oxides having completely stripped them from the photosphere . in mid- to late - l dwarf spectra , the main shapers of the emergent flux in the optical are the pressure broadened and lines . in atmospheres of lower gravity and pressure",
    ", these alkali absorptions will be less pronounced , giving them strengths comparable to a much warmer field object . in late - l dwarfs ,",
    "the hydrides begin to disappear as well , but because this condensation will likely be inhibited in a lower gravity object just as it is for tio and vo , these hydrides will appear in the spectrum at later types than normally seen .",
    "the combination of these two effects , then , conspire to create a spectrum which is virtually indistinguishable from an earlier type l dwarf of higher gravity . in other words ,",
    "the lower gravity spectrum will have weaker alkalis and stronger hydrides than a high gravity l dwarf of comparable temperature .",
    "hence there may be a degeneracy at mid- and late - l types whereby low - gravity objects are very difficult or impossible to distinguish in the optical .",
    "2mass j2244 + 2043 may be the first such object where this degeneracy is seen .",
    "as suggested in @xcite , near - infrared colors may provide an independent means of identifying low - gravity l dwarfs . in the case of 2mass j0141@xmath114633 ,",
    "the emergent flux at @xmath45- and @xmath46-bands is significantly higher , relative to the @xmath47-band flux , than that of a normal dwarf of the same optical spectral type .",
    "this is evident in its 2mass measured near - infrared color of j - k@xmath48=1.735@xmath00.054 , which is far redder than the j - k@xmath48=1.29 color ( see figure  [ shrimp ] ) of a normal l0 dwarf .",
    "the unusually red color is believed to be caused by reduced collision - induced absorption by h@xmath31 as expected at lower gravity ( lower pressure ) .",
    "( see @xcite for opacity plots of cia h@xmath31 demonstrating that @xmath45-band and especially @xmath46-band should be the most affected . ) another way of stating this is that low gravity dwarfs should tend to have redder j - k@xmath48 colors than higher gravity dwarfs of the same type .",
    "optically determined spectral types should be independent of changes in the near - infrared cia h@xmath31 opacity , so plots of optical type vs.  j - k@xmath48 color may be useful in ferreting out other young objects .",
    "we can check this by making the plot shown in figure  [ shrimp ] , which highlights objects already known to have the spectroscopic hallmarks of lower gravity .    to construct this plot",
    "we have built three samples spanning the ultra - cool dwarf regime from m7 to l8 :    @xmath49 m7-m9.5 : any published objects classified as m7 to m9.5 based on optical spectra were eligible for inclusion .",
    "however , objects selected photometrically from near - infrared surveys were excluded as this might bias the distribution of j - k@xmath48 colors . primarily this sample is built from published spectroscopic follow - up of objects selected from proper motion studies or selected from optical photometric surveys .",
    "to ensure adequate statistics we built this list at random until the number of objects in each integral subtype bin ( m7 - 7.5 , m8 - 8.5 , and m9 - 9.5 ) was roughly twenty - five .",
    "@xmath49 l0-l5.5 : finding l dwarfs free of near - infrared photometric selection bias would result in very small or null lists of objects , so we simply drew our sample from the lists given at http://www.dwarfarchives.org .",
    "objects had to have well measured optical types ( i.e. , no uncertain types were included ) and errors in the 2mass j - k@xmath48 color had to be @xmath10.10 mag .",
    "@xmath49 l6-l8 : the selection criteria were the same as for the l0-l5.5 sample except that the restriction on j - k@xmath48 color error was dropped to increase the sample size .",
    "these three samples are graphically presented in figure  [ shrimp ] .",
    "each bin along the y - axis represents a full integral subtype : `` m7 '' includes m7 and m7.5 dwarfs , `` m8 '' includes m8 and m8.5 dwarfs , etc .",
    "`` l8 '' includes only type l8 because optical types of l8.5 , l9 , and l9.5 are not currently defined . in order to show more information than a standard",
    "histogram would allow , we have plotted the distributions as follows .",
    "for each bin , the median color in the group is plotted highest in the bin ; colors falling further from the median are plotted progressively lower down the y - axis .",
    "this gives each bin a patterning of points that look approximately like an inverted `` v '' .",
    "as each individual point contributing to the distribution is plotted on such a diagram , the error bars on each of the individual color measurements can also be shown .",
    "with these samples in hand , we then checked objects comprising these lists and marked those displaying signatures of low - gravity in their spectra .",
    "these low - gravity objects are labeled on figure  [ shrimp ] . as predicted ,",
    "the low - gravity objects tend to have redder j - k@xmath48 colors , sometimes dramatically redder , than the median color for their optical spectral class . however , there are also low - gravity dwarfs with j - k@xmath48 colors that are nt unusually red .",
    "moreover , there appear to be some objects having very red j - k@xmath48 colors for their type but no indication of lower gravity in their optical spectra .",
    "two examples are the m9.5 dwarf ssspm j2310@xmath111759 ( @xcite ; j - k@xmath48=1.407@xmath00.041 ) and the l4.5 dwarf 2mass j0512@xmath112949 ( j - k@xmath48=2.178@xmath00.071 ) from the southern l dwarf sample of table  [ l_candidates ] and table  [ new_spec_obs ] .",

    "( on the blue side of the distribution , unusually blue objects are sometimes low - metallicity dwarfs [ @xcite ] in which collision induced absorption by h@xmath31 is the dominant absorption mechanism in the near - infrared , whereas other blue objects may have atypically thin and/or large - grained clouds decks that may be unrelated or only partly the result of lower metallicity [ @xcite ] . ) therefore , unusually red near - infrared colors alone can not be used to identify low - gravity dwarfs because higher metallicity and/or dustier l dwarfs can also exhibit redder colors for their optical type .      as the number of low - gravity ultra - cool dwarfs in the published literature continues to grow ( see table  [ young_dwarfs ] ) , we must ask whether their frequency of occurrence is consistent with expectations . if the frequency is much higher than predictions",
    ", then this would suggest that we may have assigned the wrong physical cause to peculiarities observed in the optical spectra above .",
    "there are also clear indications that these low - gravity dwarfs tend to be found in the southern hemisphere , where known , nearby ( @xmath1100 pc ) young stellar associations are concentrated . because non - neglible color selection biases exist for late - m dwarfs in the studies discussed below , we restrict the subsequent discussion to l dwarfs alone .    the first two peculiar l dwarfs were noted by @xcite and we now believe that one of these , 2mass j2208 + 2921 , can be explained via low - gravity ( youth ) . that original sample contained 92 l dwarfs with optical spectra and spectral type determinations .",

    ", this result appears at odds with the frequency found in the earlier kirkpatrick sample .",
    "it is important to note , however , that this newer sample contains only objects located south of dec=0@xmath2 .",
    "the on - going sample of cruz and collaborators expands markedly on the kirkpatrick samples .",
    "all objects were photometrically selected using the same prescription regardless of hemisphere ( @xcite ) , so the sample is uniform . in that collection",
    "there are 241 field l dwarfs with optical spectra and spectral classifications , 22 of which show low - gravity features .",
    "that sample , comprised of a nearly equal split of objects at northern vs.  southern declinations ( 116 in the north , 125 in the south ) , gives a low - gravity fraction of 22/241 , or 9.1@xmath01.9% .",

    "both @xcite and @xcite provide predictions for the makeup of the low - mass star and brown dwarf populations in the solar neighborhood .",
    "the former paper uses bayesian statistical methods to compute the mass and age distribution that best constructs the observed field luminosity function , using the evolutionary models of @xcite .",
    "the latter work uses monte carlo simulations on a range of plausible star formation rates and initial mass functions along with theoretical evolutinary models from @xcite and @xcite to predict an array of possible outcomes for the makeup of the solar neighorhood .",
    "both works demonstrated that l dwarfs are expected to be , on average , younger than m dwarfs or t dwarfs .",
    "kinematic evidence supports this claim .",
    "@xcite measure @xmath52 space motions and deduce that nearby l and t dwarfs appear to comprise a kinematically younger population , with ages in the likely interval 0.5 - 4 gyr , than that of stars with types g through early - m .",
    "the underlying reason for the relative youth of l dwarfs is the fact that they are comprised of two distinct populations .",
    "some l dwarfs are actually low - mass stars , but theory predicts that the only `` stellar '' l dwarfs are those falling in a very restrictive mass range ( @xmath130.072 - 0.085 @xmath53 according to the @xcite models ; see figure 9.20 of @xcite ) .",
    "the rest of the l dwarfs are brown dwarfs that never settle onto a main sequence and continue to cool with time .",
    "hence , the transitory nature of the `` substellar '' l dwarfs means that the only brown dwarfs seen at these spectral types are those that have not yet had sufficient time to cool into the t dwarf class .    to compare our observational data to predictions , we use evidence from previous sections that our ability to label an l dwarf spectrum as low gravity is indicative of the fact that the object has an age of @xmath13100 myr or younger .",
    "the @xcite results predict that within a given volume of space there is a 3.1% probability of a field m6 dwarf being younger than 100 myr . at type l0",
    "this probability increases to 5.6% . at mid- to late - l this probability drops to 3.7% and plummets further to 2.1% for early - t and 1.6% for late - t .",
    "the median age as a function of effective temperature and shows that the median age is substantially lower in the early - l through mid - t dwarf regime than it is for late - m dwarfs or late - t dwarfs .",
    "such numbers are applicable to a complete volume - limited sample . unfortunately , the kirkpatrick samples are primarily limited by the depths of 2mass , and the cruz samples , which were designed to provide a complete census of l dwarfs within 20 pc of the sun using 2mass data , used a sliding magnitude limit depending upon the j - k@xmath48 color of the object in 2mass . in both the cruz and @xcite samples",
    ", late - l dwarfs were specifically targetted by using fainter magnitude limits for candidates with redder colors .",
    "as we have seen in  4.3 , this biases our searches in favor of young , earlier l dwarfs at fainter magnitudes ( and presumably larger distances ) since these low - gravity objects tend to have redder j - k@xmath48 colors ( see figure  [ shrimp ] ) .",
    "very young objects are not expected to be well mixed with older constituents of the milky way , so our all - sky total is the best metric to use for comparison .",
    "our overall rate of 7.6@xmath01.6% for l dwarfs with ages less than @xmath13100 myr is in rough agreement with the @xcite predicted rate of 3.7 - 5.6% once the j - k@xmath48 color selection bias is considered .",
    "the difference between hemispheres is likely attributable to the fact that the southern sky has a preponderance of young , nearby associations , and our selection technique is particularly well tuned to find examples beyond the intended distance cutoff .",
    "we discuss more about these associations in the following section .",
    "table  [ young_dwarfs ] lists the low - gravity field dwarfs discussed above along with other low - gravity ultracool field dwarfs from other published work .",
    "this list contains 20 objects total .",

    "given their implied youth and relative proximity to the sun , could these objects be members of previously identified young stellar associations ?",
    "figure  [ skymap ] shows the locations of these 20 sources plotted on the celestial sphere . plotted for comparison",
    "are the locations of members of the four young ( @xmath1100 myr ) , nearby ( @xmath160 pc ) stellar associations currently recognized ( @xcite )  the tw hydrae association ( @xmath138 myr ) , the @xmath3 pictoris moving group ( @xmath1312 myr ) , the tucana - horologium association ( @xmath1330 myr ) , and the ab doradus moving group ( @xmath1350 myr ) .",
    "we have coded the symbols for each of the 20 sources so that those believed to have ages near 100 myr are shown as solid stars and those believed to be substantially younger ( @xmath1310 myr , as determined in  4.2 or from references in the literature ) are shown as open stars .",

    "as noted in @xcite , 2mass j0141@xmath114633 has a sky location coincident with both the @xmath3 pictoris moving group and the tucana / horologium association along with an estimated age range in agreement with both groups .",
    "other very young candiates ",
    "2mass j0241@xmath110326 and 2mass 2213@xmath112136  have sky locations and assumed ages consistent with known members of the @xmath3 pictoris moving group .",
    "others appear to have sky locations and young ages inconsistent with membership in any of these known groups .",
    "three northern hemisphere objects lying along an almost constant line of ra=10@xmath5423@xmath55 fall in a part of the sky well separated from the other groups .",
    "all five of the young candidates with @xmath56ra@xmath57 also lie in a part of the sky sparsely populated by known association members .",
    "nonetheless , given the closeness of some of these nearby groups , our solar system may fall near an edge or even within the true spatial volume of the association . in this case , members can fall almost anywhere on the sky and locations provide only weak constraints for individual objects .",
    "kinematic and distance information is required to establish membership with certainty .    at the moment we have proper motions for only a few of these 20 objects .",
    "trigonometric parallaxes and radial velocities are also needed so that distances and uvw space motions can be measured .",
    "only then we can test for membership in known groups and see if there may be objects , particularly the northern ones , that may be hinting at the presence of heretofore unrecognized , young associations .",
    "most intriguing is the possibility of uncovering young associations solely of low - mass stars , assuming such a mode of star formation can actually occur .",
    "we have begun some of this follow - up work and will report progress in forthcoming papers .",
    "a number of the newly acquired keck - lris spectra from figure  [ allspec_lin ] and figure  [ new_lt_lin ] show the 6708-  line in absorption .",
    "zooms of the 6300 - 7100   region of these eight spectra are shown in figure  [ lithium_spectra ] .",
    "equivalent width measurements or limits for all of the lris spectra are given in table  [ new_spec_obs ] through table  [ new_spec_t ] .",
    "as has been true in previous summaries , we do not detect the line in any the late - m or t dwarfs at the @xmath1310   resolution we employ .      using the list of lithium detections along with the non - detections in table  [ new_spec_obs ] and table  [ new_spec_ml ]",
    ", we can update the lithium statistics plot first presented as figure 7 of @xcite .",
    "this update is shown in figure  [ li_stats ] . in the upper panel",
    "we show the measured equivalent widths as a function of optical spectral type for all l dwarfs for which we have obtained lris spectra , now numbering 123 objects .",
    "the two panels below this encapsulate the statistical analysis of this distribution . in the middle panel",
    "is shown the percentage of l dwarfs with detections of 3   or more as a function of optical type .",
    "due to the increased sample of late - l dwarfs now available , we can now state confidently that there is a slight turnover at late - l in the fraction of objects with strong lines .",
    "in fact , none of the t dwarfs for which we have optical spectra in table  [ new_spec_t ] or those included in @xcite show , although their detection limits are generally worse than 3   equivalent width .",
    "this weakening of the line is further demonstrated in the bottom panel of figure  [ li_stats ] , which shows as a function of type the equivalent width of those lines which are detected . after growing steadily from early - l through mid - l",
    ", these strengths peak around l5.5-l6.5 then weaken for later types .",
    "the peak in strength at @xmath13l6 corresponds roughly to the temperatures where monatomic lithium is expected to disappear into molecular form ( @xcite ) .",
    "it should be kept in mind , however , that our measurements are made against a relative continuum heavily influenced by wings of the strong `` d '' doublet to the blue and strong doublet to the red .",
    "that having been said , @xcite shows that both na and k are expected to disappear into molecular species ( solid na@xmath31s and gaseous kcl ) at temperatures much lower than this , so the abrupt change in strength is probably not caused by modulations in the continuum opacity .",
    "hence , the li weakening can safely be attributed to the disappearance of monatomic lithium from the atmosphere .",
    "@xcite predicts that the culprit is the formation of licl gas .",
    "it should also be noted that lithium is expected to disappear in monatomic form before either cesium or rubidium does , again in agreement with our observations .",
    "we now have in hand a sufficiently large sample of l dwarfs spanning ranges in temperature and age that we can examine in detail the `` second order '' effect of line strength versus age . to quantify this , we select four optical spectral types ",
    "l0 , l2 , l4 , and l6.5  where we have a good sampling across a wide span of ages .",
    "objects in each of those bins can be divided into two sets : those with normal spectra and those with spectra that appear peculiar because of low - gravity effects , as discussed in  4.2 .",
    "table  [ lithium_age_grid ] lists objects by spectral type ( column 1 ) , name ( columns 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8) and their equivalent width measurements ( columns 3 , 5 , 7 , and 9 ) .",
    "dwarfs with normal , non - peculiar spectra are given in columns 2 - 5 , with those showing no lithium in columns 2 - 3 , and those with lithium in columns 4 - 5 .",
    "dwarfs exhibiting peculiar , low - gravity spectra are listed in columns 6 - 7 , and those with very peculiar , low - gravity spectra are listed in columns 8 - 9 . by dividing the columns in this way we are subdividing the spectra into empirical age bins .",
    "normal spectra without detected are expected to be high mass and old .",
    "normal spectra with are expected to be somewhat lower in mass , and because they have the same spectral type as the non - lithium dwarfs , must therefore be younger .",
    "spectra exhibiting low - gravity features are expected to be younger still , and those showing the most peculiar features are expected to be of even lower gravity and the youngest of all .",
    "we analyze each grouping in the table :    _ l0 : _ we have optical spectra of six objects with normal l0 spectral types",
    ". there are five where no lithium line was detected , and two of these had no detection down to 0.5   equivalent width ( ew ) .",
    "these are presumably the older , higher - mass l0 s .",
    "the fifth normal l0 exhibits a line with 3   ew .",
    "presumably this object is younger and lower in mass than the others .",
    "we have optical spectra of an additional six l0 s with unusual spectra .",
    "the three less peculiar ones , which we believe have an age near 100 myr ( in fact , one is a member of the pleiades ) , show no line .",
    "two of these show no line down to at least 3   ew . the other objects , which we believe to have ages substantially less than 100 myr based on discussion in  4.2 , show no lines down to 2   ew or better .",
    "figure  [ li_seq_l0 ] plots the highest - snr spectrum from each of the four age bins .",
    "the inset is a zoom around the location of the 6708-   line to demonstrate how the li strength varies as a function of age .",
    "notice that the line when detectable is still very weak .",
    "_ l2 : _ we have optical spectra of twelve objects with normal l2 spectral types .",
    "there are nine with no detection , with all but one of these having no measurable line down to 1   ew . the three other normal l2s have detections of 1.7 , 6 , and 8   ew and are presumably younger and lower mass than the first nine . the object with the 1.7 ",
    "ew detection is the binary kelu-1 ab , for which @xcite estimate an age of 300 - 800 myr .",
    "this object may be somewhat older than the other objects in its age bin because the detected lithium is presumed to come from the lower mass secondary , not from the primary itself .",
    "we also note three l2s whose spectra appear peculiar due to low gravity .",
    "all of these are believed to be @xmath13100 myr old , and they have ews of 4 and 6  .",
    "no l2 dwarfs have yet been identified in the `` very peculiar dwarfs '' category of table  [ lithium_age_grid ] .",
    "figure  [ li_seq_l2 ] shows an example spectrum from each age bin .",
    "appreciable detections are seen in the two bins of lowest age .",
    "_ l4 : _ we have optical spectra of six objects with normal l4 spectral types .",
    "of these , five have no measurable line , the most stringent limits being the 0.5 and 0.7   measures in the two objects with the highest signal - to - noise .",
    "one of these , gd 165b , is believed to have an age of 1.2 - 5.5 gyr based on age estimates of its white dwarf primary ( @xcite ) .",
    "the other two normal l4s have measured ews of 3.3 and 10.5   and presumably are younger and lower mass than the others .",
    "additionally we have optical spectra of one peculiar l4 and one peculiar l4.5 , which are assumed to be lower gravity than the normal l4s . the slightly peculiar l4.5 , gl 417b ,",
    "is believed to have an age of 80 - 300 myr based on age indicators from its g dwarf primary ( @xcite ) , and it shows a ew of 11.5  . further complicating the interpretation of this spectrum",
    "is the fact that imaging by the hubble space telescope hints that the b component itself is a double ( @xcite ) .",
    "the other peculiar l4 , 2mass j1615 + 4953 , has no detection down to 8   ew but the snr is poor and this object may be unusual because of excess dust and not because of low gravity , as stated in  4.2 .",
    "no extremely peculiar l4 dwarfs are yet known , so the rightmost column in table  [ lithium_age_grid ] is again blank .",
    "figure  [ li_seq_l4 ] shows a spectrum for each of the other three age bins .",
    "_ l6.5 : _ we have optical spectra of six objects with normal l6.5 spectral types .",
    "three of these do not show , and two of these have stringent limits of at least @xmath12   ew .",
    "the three other l6.5 spectra all show .",
    "two of these show a strong line of at least @xmath1312   ew .",
    "although both appear to have normal spectra in the optical , 2mass j2148 + 4003 has a strikingly unusual near - infrared spectrum whose oddities are likely due to excessive atmospheric dust ( @xcite ) . the final l6.5 spectrum , 2mass j2244 + 2043 , shows a weaker line of only @xmath135   ew .",
    "although its optical spectrum appears normal , we place it in the `` peculiar '' bin only because its near - infrared spectrum show odd features that are best attributed to low gravity ( @xcite ) .",
    "no l6.5 objects are known that might occupy the rightmost columns of the table .",
    "figure  [ li_seq_l6.5 ] depicts these results graphically , with insets showing the range in ew .",
    "to summarize , the true strength of line as a function of age is difficult to interpret from the extant data for several reasons : ( 1 ) many of the age bins in table  [ lithium_age_grid ] are sparsely populated so conclusions are based on poor statistics ; ( 2 ) both known and unrecognized binarity makes the interpretation of even well measured lines difficult as it is not known _ a priori _ what the relative contributions to the line strength are from the primary and the secondary ; ( 3 ) some of these spectra have snr levels that are too low at 6708   to obtain accurate ew measurements . for",
    "now , we see evidence indicating that the line weakens markedly for the youngest ages , but the most important tests of this  the very peculiar l dwarfs of lowest gravity  have not yet been identified for types later than @xmath13l0 . high signal - to - noise spectra of additional low - gravity field l dwarfs , such as those to be discussed in @xcite , and confirmed l dwarf members of young clusters are needed to bolster the statistics .",
    "theory stipulates that objects below @xmath1360 m@xmath58 will never reach the lithium fusion temperature of @xmath132@xmath410@xmath59k , so they will always retain their primordial complement of lithium .",
    "objects of higher mass easily destroy their lithium , which is not produced as a byproduct of normal thermonuclear reactions in the cores of stars and brown dwarfs .",
    "therefore , the absence of lithium can be used as a direct test of substellarity , as first proposed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculated that brown dwarfs with masses of 60 m@xmath58 will have depleted their stores of lithium by a factor of two in 250 myr and by a factor of one hundred in 1 gyr .",
    "higher mass objects burn up the lithium more quickly , a 70 m@xmath58 object reducing its store by a factor of two in 130 myr and by a factor of one hundred in 220 myr .",
    "an 80 m@xmath58 object accomplishes these same feats in 90 and 140 myr , respectively .",
    "complete lithium destruction occurs because these objects spend the first portion of their lives as m dwarfs , where they are fully convective and fully mixed .",
    "therefore , material in the upper atmosphere of the object eventually circulates to the core where lithium burning can take place .",
    "all brown dwarfs with masses above 60 m@xmath58 are expected to go through the fully convective mid- to late - m dwarf regime ( see evolutionary tracks in figures 8 and 9 of @xcite ) , residing there for at least the first @xmath13400 myr of their lives , then they evolve to lower temperatures where they may no longer be convective .",
    "this allows plenty of time for the depletion to have occurred , according to the models .    however , retaining a primordial abundance of lithium and being able to detect that lithium observationally in the spectrum are two different issues .",
    "there are two regimes where the lithium test may have to be amended",
    ". the first concerns objects of very cool temperature .",
    "we have already observed that the equivalent width of the line at 6708   diminishes on average at types later than @xmath13l6 , presumably due to the formation of lithium - bearing molecules at colder temperatures .",
    "the second concerns objects of very low gravity . as first mentioned in @xcite the lithium test should also be carefully considered before being applied to brown dwarfs of very young age .",
    "the reason for this is the expected ( and observed ) weakening of the other alkali lines as gravity is diminished ; the line is expected to weaken too , thus making the lithium test more difficult to use in this regime .",
    "we derived a test of this using empirical data in  5.2 , but results were inconclusive .",
    "do atmospheric models of l dwarfs predict a weakening of the line ?",
    "figure  [ models ] shows the behavior of models at three different temperatures as gravity is lowered .",
    "it should be noted that interior physics , such as the destruction of lithium by convection toward the core , is not included in these simulations ; the total lithium abundance is held fixed so that the behavior of the line is due solely to atmospheric chemistry and physics . in the 2400k models , corresponding roughly to an optical type of l0 ( see  9.4.1 of @xcite ) , the line is seen only at the highest gravities and disappears entirely by log(g)=5.0 at the resolution ( 10  ) shown here .",
    "at 2100k , corresponding to an optical type of l2 , the line weakens and then vanishes around log(g)=4.0 . at 1800k",
    ", corresponding to types l4 - 4.5 , the line weakens throughout the gravity sequence and vanishes only at log(g)=2.5 .    in conclusion",
    ", we find that theory predicts the weakening of the line at lower gravities , an effect supported ( albeit weakly ) by current observational data .",
    "although additional optical spectra of l dwarfs covering a wide range of gravities / ages are needed to bolster the empirical evidence , predictions nonetheless bear out the caveat addressed by @xcite in their study of 2mass j0141@xmath114633 .",
    "namely , they suggested that researchers apply the lithium test with caution for very young brown dwarfs because the line is expected to be considerably weaker and may , in fact , be undetectable at moderate resolution in those objects .",
    "using a large set of optical specta , we have shown that a subset of objects with peculiar spectra can be identified as low - gravity brown dwarfs .",
    "low gravity is a hallmark of youth , as these objects have lower masses and more extended atmospheres than higher mass , older field dwarfs .",
    "we find that the observed percentage of young ( @xmath1100 myr old ) l dwarfs in our sample ",
    "7.6@xmath01.6%  is consistent with theoretical predictions once selection biases are considered . even though low gravity enables these young objects to be identified readily via spectroscopy",
    ", it complicates the brown dwarf `` lithium test '' because it weakens the observable line for a given lithium abundance and spectral type .",
    "our sample of young brown dwarfs is found to lie primarily in the southern hemisphere , which ( probably not coincidentally ) is the location of known , nearby young associations .",
    "further work on these young objects is needed to establish or refute membership in these groups .",
