    "one key concern in the study of early - type galaxies , is the amount of discrete x - ray sources relative to hot gas in x - ray faint ellipticals .",
    "it is generally agreed that integrated x - ray emission from stellar sources ( such as accreting x - ray binaries ) is likely to be present at some fraction in all elliptical galaxies .",
    "this contribution is low in x - ray  luminous galaxies ( i.e. @xmath2 ) , where hot , diffuse gas dominates the total x - ray emission ( e.g. forman , jones & tucker 1985 ; canizares , fabbiano & trinchieri 1987 ; davis & white 1996 ; brown & bregman 1998 ; buote & fabian 1998 ) . the fraction of x - ray emission from stellar sources is expected to increase with decreasing @xmath3 , but the @xmath3 at which the stellar component ( @xmath4 ) dominates the observed emission is still debated .    using _ einstein observatory _ , _ rosat _ , and _ asca _ data ,",
    "researchers have derived estimates ( or upper limits ) to the stellar x - ray emission in e and s0 galaxies using various methods .",
    "forman , jones & tucker ( 1985 ) determined an upper limit of @xmath5 ( _ einstein _ ipc band ) by assuming discrete sources make a 50% contribution to the total diffuse x - ray emission of cen a. in this limit , only the faintest galaxies ( @xmath6 in their sample ) can have their x - ray emission dominated by discrete - source emission .",
    "irwin & sarazin ( 1998 ) concluded that the x - ray emission of faint galaxies ( @xmath7 ) is a combination of a hard stellar component and a very soft component , which is most likely stellar in origin as well .",
    "this was inferred by comparing the x - ray",
    " colors \" of a sample of early - type galaxies to the bulge of m31 ( @xmath8 ; irwin 2000 , private communication ) .",
    "fabbiano , gioia & trinchieri ( 1989 ) used the average @xmath9 of early - type spirals ( @xmath10 , for @xmath11 ) as the benchmark for the stellar contribution . by comparing the @xmath3 and @xmath12 of elliptical and s0 galaxies to spirals ( in the _ einstein _",
    "0.54.5 kev ) , they concluded that x - ray emission from hot gas is not significant in systems for which @xmath13 . in the various estimates of the stellar emission fraction",
    ", there is an order of magnitude difference , making an accurate determination even more necessary .",
    "the primary mechanisms for the x - ray emission can be determined through the examination of x - ray spectra ( e.g. , trinchieri , kim , fabbiano , & canizares 1994 ; loewenstein & mushotzky 1997 ; buote & fabian 1998 ) . a hard spectrum ( @xmath14 10 kev ) would indicate the presence of evolved stellar sources , while soft x - rays ( @xmath14 1 kev ) would be reflective of a hot gas component .",
    "recent work incorporating the use of multi - temperature spectral models indicate the presence of a very soft component in addition to the hard and soft components described above , the nature of which is suspected by most to be stellar in origin but which may be due in part to a warm ism ( pellegrini & fabbiano 1994 ; fabbiano , kim , & trinchieri 1994 ; kim et al . 1996 ) .",
    "_ rosat _ , although it has better angular resolution than the _ einstein observatory _ , does not provide high enough spectral resolution to show signatures unique to a stellar population , especially in fainter systems .",
    "another problem with spectral modeling is that acceptable fits can be obtained with both single temperature models and multi - temperature models .",
    "even with the better resolution of _ asca _ , calibration problems at low energies may affect spectral modeling .",
    "the use of x - ray radial surface brightness profiles offers another way to determine the relative fractions of gas and discrete sources to the observed x - ray emission .",
    "previously , these profiles existed only for x - ray - bright galaxies for which adequate signal - to - noise data was achieved , and were used to obtain gas densities and masses , test predictions of the cooling flow model , or model the dynamical evolution of gas flows ( sarazin & white 1988 ; pellegrini & ciotti 1998 ; david , forman & jones 1991 ) . the use of surface brightness profiles to infer the contributions to the x - ray emission has been limited , and few conclusions have been reached with regard to faint galaxies ( forman , jones & tucker 1985 ; trinchieri , g. , fabbiano , g. , & canizares , c. r. 1986 ; pellegrini & fabbiano 1994 ) .",
    "data has become available through _ rosat _ that better allow for the examination of radial surface brightness profiles of fainter galaxies .",
    "brown & bregman ( 1998 , 2000 ) provide x - ray information on a _ rosat _ survey of early - type galaxies extending to fainter x - ray luminosities than available from _ einstein observatory _ data . in this paper ,",
    "radial surface brightness profiles are used to determine or set upper limits to the stellar contribution in the less luminous galaxies of this survey .",
    "the galaxies chosen for this study ( see table [ tab : sub ] ) are the x - ray faintest galaxies of the brown & bregman ( 1998 ) survey of early - type galaxies .",

    "the @xmath0 model was developed initially to describe hot gas behavior in clusters , but has been often extended to individual elliptical galaxies ( gorenstein et al .",
    "1978 ; fabricant & gorenstein 1983 ; forman , jones & tucker 1985 ; trinchieri , fabbiano , & canizares 1986 ) .",

    "x - ray emission of bright early - type galaxies , modeled with this king function , demonstrate radial surface brightness profiles that decline more slowly than optical profiles at large radii ( e.g. , forman , jones & tucker 1985 ) .",
    "a de vaucouleurs @xmath74 law is used to trace the integrated emission from discrete x - ray sources .",
    "the discrete source emission is most likely dominated by low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) in the galaxy ( irwin & sarazin 1998 ; david , forman , & jones 1991 ; trinchieri & fabbiano 1985 ) .",
    "lmxbs come from an evolved stellar population , so their x - ray brightness distribution should follow that of stars ( pellegrini & fabbiano 1994 ) .",

    "other models , including king models , have been used to parameterize the stellar profiles of early - type galaxies .",
    "this was primarily because there is no straightforward transformation from the de vaucouleurs function to an analytic form of the density distribution .",
    "however , since our goal is not to derive a density distribution , this is of no concern .",
    "a fitting algorithm was developed to determine the four parameters - @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath0 , and @xmath76 - that best represent the data according to the models described above .",
    "the models are convolved with an instrumental point spread function ( a gaussian of @xmath77 fwhm for the pspc , and @xmath78 fwhm for the hri ) , which has the form @xmath79 where @xmath80 .",

    "( 1996 ) study of an x - ray faint s0 galaxy , ngc 4382 , reports that the hard spectral component contributes one - half to three - fourths of the total x - ray luminosity , with the remainder due to the vsc .",
    "this is consistent with the earlier _ rosat _ results which indicate that the vcs and hard components contribute near equally to the total x - ray emission in galaxies with log @xmath118 ( @xmath3 in ergs s@xmath24 and @xmath12 in @xmath25 )",
    ". the vsc may be due to a warm ism , arise from stellar sources , or be a combination of both ( irwin & sarazin 1998 ; fabbiano , kim , & trinchieri 1994 ) .",
    "our results may be indicative of the vsc having an ism origin , considering that the best - fit modeling is consistent with a substantial ism component .    in this initial analysis of x - ray surface brightness profiles ,",
    "we have assumed low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) are the primary constituents of a discrete x - ray source population .",
    "lmxbs contribute to the bulk of x - ray emission in large spiral bulges such as m31 ( trinchieri & fabbiano 1985 ) .",
    "because spiral bulges are very similar to elliptical galaxies in their properties and stellar populations , it is reasonable to presuppose that lmxbs are also the main contributors to the discrete source population in early - type galaxies ( david , forman , & jones 1991 ; irwin & sarazin 1998 ) .",
    "however , it is possible that globular clusters may be a significant source of x - ray emission in x - ray faint e and s0 galaxies ( trinchieri & fabbiano 1985 ) , in which case the x - ray radial brightness distribution due to non - gaseous sources may be more appropriately described by a model other than a pure de vaucouleurs @xmath74 law .",
    "the goal of finding the stellar contribution in x - ray faint galaxies has been hampered by low photon counts and lack of data from both _",
    "rosat _ detectors .",
    "long observations with chandra will be especially helpful in constraining the core radii in faint galaxies , fixing the shape of the radial surface brightness profiles , and resolving bright point sources .",
    "it is also hoped that chandra will provide the spectral resolution needed to determine whether the  very soft component \" modeled by various authors ( see  [ sec : intro ] ) is due to a warm ism of to discrete sources .",
    "additionally , techniques that circumvent the problem of low counts , such as defining x - ray  colors \" ( irwin & sarazin 1998 ) , will be helpful in obtaining a definite answer to the long - standing question of dominant emission mechanisms in x - ray faint early - type galaxies .",
