    "recently , the idea has been put forward to generalize the heavy quark expansion to obtain a qcd - based description of inclusive decays of heavy hadrons @xcite . similarly to the case of deep - inelastic scattering , an operator product expansion is applied to the product of two local currents .",

    "the total decay rates can then be written as an expansion in inverse powers of @xmath8 .",
    "the operators appearing at leading order have dimension three and correspond to the free - quark decay .",

    "decays , they can be parameterized by two low - energy parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 , which are related to the kinetic energy @xmath13 of the @xmath14-quark inside the @xmath10-meson , and to the mass splitting between @xmath10- and @xmath15-mesons .",

    "we show that , in both cases , the spectrum can be written as a convolution of the free - quark decay rate with a fundamental light - cone structure function . in sect .",
    "[ sec:4 ] , we illustrate our results using a simple model , which incorporates the known properties of the structure function and provides a description of the decay spectrum in terms of a single parameter . sect .",
    "[ sec:5 ] deals with a discussion of possibilities to extract information about the structure function from experimental data on the lepton spectra in inclusive semileptonic @xmath10-decays . in sect .",
    "[ sec:6 ] , we summarize our results and give some conclusions .",
    "by the optical theorem , any inclusive decay rate can be related to the imaginary part of a transition operator @xmath56 , which is defined in terms of the time - ordered product of two local operators . for the cases at hand ,",
    "this correlator is of the form @xmath57 where @xmath18 is the momentum transferred to the leptons , and @xmath58 are combinations of dirac matrices .",
    "the @xmath14-quark field @xmath59 is related to the conventional field that appears in the qcd lagrangian by a phase redefinition : @xmath60 this is appropriate to make explicit a trivial but strong dependence of the free quark field on the large mass @xmath61 . written in terms of the rescaled fields , the hadronic matrix element in ( [ tdefi ] ) is free of large momentum scales .",
    "hence , the relevant momentum transfer is @xmath62 up to the difference between @xmath61 and @xmath63 , the variable @xmath64 corresponds to the invariant mass of the hadronic final state .",
    "as long as @xmath64 is large enough , it is legitimate to expand the correlator in a tower of local operators of increasing dimension , which are multiplied by coefficient functions that contain inverse powers of @xmath7 . in general",
    ", this will be an expansion in three large parameters : @xmath61 , @xmath65 , and @xmath64 .",
    "over most of phase space , @xmath64 and @xmath65 scale with the heavy quark mass , and the operator product expansion reduces to an expansion in powers of @xmath20 .",
    "there is , however , a kinematic region where @xmath65 is of order @xmath61 , but @xmath66 . in this case",
    ", it is consistent to work to leading order in @xmath20 , but necessary to keep higher - order terms in @xmath64 .",
    "in fact , as we shall see , one has to resum these terms to all orders .    to leading order in @xmath20 , the heavy quark field @xmath67 in ( [ tdefi ] )",
    "can be replaced by the corresponding two - component spinor @xmath68 of the heavy quark effective theory @xcite .",
    "similarly , the physical @xmath10-meson states are replaced by the corresponding states in the @xmath52 limit . at tree - level , the leading contribution to the correlator is obtained by contracting the light - quark fields : @xmath69 here @xmath70 is the propagator of the @xmath18-quark in the background field of the light constituents of the @xmath10-meson .",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath70 has the form @xmath71 note that a derivative acting on the rescaled heavy quark field corresponds to the residual momentum @xmath72 .",
    "since the residual momentum results from the interactions of the heavy quark with light degrees of freedom , it is of order @xmath6 .    there is a lot of information that can be deduced from the structure of the background - field propagator .",
    "we will be interested in the region where the components of @xmath7 are large ( of order @xmath61 ) , since otherwise the operator product expansion breaks down .",
    "to leading order in @xmath20 , we can then neglect the covariant derivative in the numerator , as well as the term containing two derivatives in the denominator .",
    "this gives @xmath73 the term in the denominator containing the covariant derivative is of order @xmath74 . to see whether it is important",
    ", we have to distinguish different kinematic regions .",
    "when @xmath75 , the derivative term is suppressed by a factor @xmath20 . to leading order , the propagator corresponds to the propagator of a free quark with momentum @xmath7 . in this region",
    ", we thus recover the free - quark decay model up to small nonperturbative corrections .",
    "however , in the endpoint region , where @xmath76 , it is not possible to neglect the derivative term .",
    "this is why an expansion in powers of @xmath77 , which was applied in refs .",
    "@xcite to derive ( [ sexpr ] ) , becomes singular .",
    "instead , one has to use ( [ sendp ] ) for the propagator in the endpoint region .",
    "for even smaller values @xmath78 , the derivative term becomes the dominant term in the denominator , and the operator product expansion breaks down .",
    "this is the resonance region , where the invariant mass @xmath64 of the hadronic final state is close to the mass - shell of the lowest - lying resonances containing a @xmath18-quark .",
    "the fact that the resonance region is parametrically smaller than the endpoint region implies that corrections to our results , which arise from bound - state effects in the final state , are suppressed in the @xmath52 limit .",
    "this is fortunate , since these corrections are , as a matter of principle , not calculable using an operator product expansion .",
    "let us elaborate on this last point .",
    "to see to what level one is sensitive to bound - state corrections in the final state , we replace the quark mass @xmath1 by some effective mass @xmath79 , with @xmath49 of order @xmath6 .",
    "the sensitivity to such effects depends upon the size of @xmath1 . for the hypothetical case @xmath80 ,",
    "the corrections induced by @xmath81 are of order @xmath74 and thus of the same magnitude as the term containing the covariant derivative . in this case , the nonperturbative corrections to the free - quark decay model are incalculable . in the opposite limit @xmath82 , corresponding to @xmath83 , we find that the effects corresponding to @xmath81 are always subleading .",
    "they are suppressed relative to the bound - state corrections in the initial state by a factor @xmath20 .",
    "this shows that , in the analysis of the inclusive decays @xmath84 and @xmath85 @xcite , the effect of a non - vanishing @xmath30- or @xmath86-quark mass , even as large as a constituent mass , can be neglected",
    ". a very interesting case in between the above is the situation where @xmath87 , corresponding to @xmath88 .",
    "we argue that this case applies for @xmath89 decays , where @xmath29 . then the term in the propagator containing the derivative is of the same magnitude as @xmath27 , and final - state corrections induced by @xmath81 are again subleading .",
    "however , they are only suppressed by a factor @xmath90 .",
    "we thus expect that these corrections are more important than in the case of decays into light ( charmless ) final states , and that the approach to the @xmath52 limit will be slower .",
    "the above discussion shows that , for the relevant cases @xmath91 and @xmath92 , the propagator ( [ sendp ] ) can be used to resum the leading terms in the endpoint region .",
    "corrections to it are suppressed in the @xmath52 limit .",
    "it is possible to simplify the result further . to this end , we write @xmath93 and choose the vectors @xmath94 and @xmath95 such that @xmath94 is a null - vector on the forward light cone satisfying @xmath96 and @xmath97 , and thus @xmath98 . in the region where the derivative term in ( [ sendp ] ) is important ,",
    "i.e.  for @xmath65 of order @xmath61 but @xmath64 of order @xmath74 , we have @xmath99 .",
    "as long as we restrict ourselves to the leading term in the large-@xmath61 limit , we can thus neglect @xmath95 .",
    "this leads to the final expression for the effective background - field propagator : @xmath100 where we define @xmath101 . in light - cone gauge , @xmath102 ,",
    "the operator @xmath103 reduces to @xmath104 and corresponds to the light - cone residual momentum @xmath105 of the heavy quark inside the @xmath14-meson .",
    "note that the appearance of the null - vector @xmath94 is closely connected to our assumption that @xmath106 is of order @xmath74 or @xmath107 .",
    "for @xmath108 , one would have @xmath75 even in the endpoint region , and @xmath94 would be a time - like vector @xcite .",
    "however , as we have argued above , we do not believe that this case is of phenomenological importance . from now on",
    ", we shall not consider it any more .",
    "let us use this form of the propagator to calculate the leading contribution to the imaginary part of the correlator @xmath109 .",

    "[ fig:2 ] , we have multiplied the vertical scale by @xmath179 in order to comply with the definition of @xmath37 in ( [ gsplit ] ) . in order to convert the horizontal scale to the variable @xmath180 , one would have to multiply @xmath22 by @xmath181 .",
    "we find that the shape function is indeed sizable only in the endpoint region .",
    "comparing the result of our resummation to the singular form of @xmath37 given in ( [ sexpr ] ) and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , we see that the resummation has eliminated the unrealistic spike at the endpoint . what remains is a smooth function , which is rapidly varying on scales of order @xmath182 . in other words ,",
    "the decay probabilities have been redistributed such that the height of @xmath37 is strongly reduced ; however , and most importantly , the shape function now extends beyond the parton - model endpoint ( which would correspond to 2.17 gev ) .",
    "needless to say , the precise shape of @xmath37 depends on the form of the structure function @xmath118 . in the following section",
    ", we shall discuss some strategies how to extract the structure function from data .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , we show the corresponding spectra for charmless @xmath24 decays , setting @xmath183 .",
    "the nonperturbative effects in the endpoint region become more pronounced , due to the fact that the free - quark decay distribution ends with a step - function in this case .",
    "in this section , we briefly discuss how one could , in principle , extract information about the structure function @xmath118 from experimental data on inclusive semileptonic @xmath10-decays .",
    "we should mention from the beginning that our discussion will be incomplete in that it neglects radiative corrections as well as the effects of experimental uncertainties .",
    "both could be important .",
    "it is also clear from the results of refs .",
    "@xcite that a much better place to extract the structure function would be the photon spectrum in inclusive @xmath85 decays .",
    "however , in view of the fact that this spectrum will be very hard to measure in the near future , whereas very detailed data for semileptonic decay spectra already exist @xcite , we think it is worthwhile to consider possibilities to extract at least some relevant information from semileptonic decays as well .",
    "we start with a discussion of the charmless decays @xmath84 .",
    "they are particularly simple , since the nonperturbative corrections in ( [ buconv ] ) are contained in an integral over the structure function . up to an overall normalization factor ( which depends on @xmath184 and @xmath61 )",
    ", one can directly extract the function @xmath185 defined as @xmath186 from a measurement of the lepton spectrum .",
    "the normalization can be fixed by observing that @xmath185 must approach unity when @xmath187 . using the definition ( [ fdef ] ) of the structure function , we obtain @xmath188 the derivative of @xmath185 with respect to the lepton energy gives the structure function evaluated at @xmath189 : @xmath190 given a measurement of @xmath185 , one can extract the moments @xmath119 of the structure function , which have been defined in ( [ anrela ] ) , by integration with appropriate weight functions .",
    "one finds that @xcite @xmath191 = { a_{n+1}\\over 2(n+1 ) } \\,.\\ ] ] the fact that @xmath192 can be used to fix the value of @xmath61 in the step - function . in practice ,",
    "the presence of several sources of experimental and theoretical uncertainties ( in particular , radiative corrections and corrections of order @xmath20 , which we neglect in the above expressions ) will probably limit this extraction method to the first few moments .",
    "let us now turn to the case of @xmath89 decays , where the form of the convolution integral ( [ convol ] ) is more complicated .",
    "let us assume that the parameters @xmath61 and @xmath193 have been extracted from a fit of the spectrum to the free - quark decay model in the region far away from the endpoint .",
    "one can then write the observed lepton spectrum in terms of the parameter @xmath194 to leading order in the large-@xmath61 limit , the differential decay rate ( [ convol ] ) can be rewritten in the form of a convolution of the structure function @xmath118 with the parton - model distribution function @xmath195 , @xmath196 where , according to ( [ fyrho ] ) , @xmath197 up to an overall factor , and @xmath198 .",
    "let us now introduce the fourier transforms @xmath199 using ( [ bilocal ] ) , we find that @xmath200 i.e. , by taking the ratio of the fourier transforms of the observed lepton spectrum and of the parton - model distribution , one can in principle extract the matrix element of the bilocal operator in ( [ bilocal ] ) . the fourier transform of @xmath122 gives the structure function .",
    "note that the normalization of the spectra is irrelevant in this context , since we know the normalization of @xmath122 at the origin : @xmath117 .",
    "given an experimental determination of @xmath201 , one can in principle compute the low - energy parameters @xmath119 using ( [ anrela ] ) , i.e. @xmath202 in practice , such an analysis will again most likely be limited to the first few moments .",
    "a less ambitious approach that could be taken is to rely on a theory - inspired ansatz for the structure function @xmath118 , which should depend upon few parameters with a well - defined physical meaning .",
    "the goal would be to extract these parameters from a fit to experimental data .",
    "this procedure is familiar from the present analysis of inclusive decay spectra in the context of the phenomenological model of altarelli et al .",
    "we believe that a reasonable parameterization of @xmath118 should contain ( i ) the parameter @xmath136 , which determines the gap between the parton - model endpoint and the physical endpoint of the lepton spectrum , ( ii ) the parameter @xmath11 , which is proportional to the width of the endpoint region , and ( iii ) an asymmetry parameter , which is related to the third moment @xmath128 of the distribution function .",
    "an extraction of these fundamental quantities , even if it is affected by substantial uncertainties , would be most desirable .",
    "in the endpoint region of the lepton spectrum in inclusive semileptonic decays of @xmath10-mesons , a naive operator product expansion in powers of @xmath20 breaks down .",
    "the reason is that in this region of phase space , there emerges a second expansion parameter , @xmath203 , which is much larger than @xmath20 . in this case , a partial resummation of the operator product expansion is necessary before the theoretical results can be compared with data .",
    "this resummation is such that one sums all contributions of order @xmath204^n$ ] , keeping however only the leading terms in @xmath20 . in many respects ,",
    "it resembles the summation of leading - twist contributions in deep - inelastic scattering",
    ".    for the cases of @xmath24 and @xmath85 decays , where the mass of the quark in the final state can be neglected , it has been shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that the leading nonperturbative contributions close to the endpoint may be resummed into a light - cone structure function @xmath118 , which gives the probability to find a @xmath14-quark with light - cone residual momentum @xmath105 inside the @xmath10-meson . this function is defined in terms of forward matrix elements in the heavy quark effective theory .",
    "it is thus independent of @xmath61 and has a universal character . in the present paper , we have shown that the same structure function describes the inclusive decays in the presence of a finite quark - mass in the final state , provided that the ratio @xmath205 is consistently treated as being of order @xmath20 . in this case , however , the nonperturbative corrections to the leading behavior are of order @xmath206 . some of these corrections are due to hadronization effects in the final state and appear to be incalculable in the context of the operator product expansion . numerically , they could be quite significant . yet , since @xmath207 for case of @xmath89 decays , we argue that our results should apply and should provide a correct description of the leading nonperturbative effects .",
    "we should point out that a different position was taken by bigi et al .",
    "@xcite , where it was argued that @xmath2 transitions are close to the so - called `` small velocity limit '' , where @xmath208 is assumed to be much smaller than @xmath61 , corresponding to @xmath209 . in this case , even the leading effects are no longer described by the universal light - cone distribution function . which of the two cases is closer to reality remains to be seen .",
    "we note , however , that the experimental fact that semileptonic @xmath10-decays are not saturated by the exclusive modes @xmath210 indicates that the `` small velocity limit '' , in which these two modes would saturate the total rate , can only be a rather crude approximation .    in both cases",
    ", @xmath24 and @xmath211 decays , the lepton spectrum can be written as a convolution of the free - quark decay distribution with the universal structure function @xmath118 .",
    "we have shown that the effect of the momentum distribution of the heavy quark inside the meson can be understood in terms of an effective mass @xmath212 , which determines the decay kinematics .",
    "over most of phase space , the free - quark decay distribution is slowly varying on scales of order @xmath6 , whereas the light - cone distribution function is sharply peaked around @xmath213 with an intrinsic width of order @xmath6 . in this case",
    ", the convolution reproduces the parton model up to small nonperturbative corrections of order @xmath28 . in the endpoint region",
    ", however , the free - quark decay distribution falls steeply , and the convolution becomes sensitive to the details of the structure function .",
    "this leads to large , genuinely nonperturbative effects in the lepton spectrum , which may all be attributed to bound - state corrections in the initial state .",
    "in particular , as one approaches the endpoint , the effective mass approaches the mass of the physical @xmath10-meson , and one recovers the correct position of the maximum lepton energy .",
    "we have illustrated the effects of nonperturbative corrections using a simple one - parameter model , which however includes many of the ingrediences of a more sophisticated description . for simplicity , and since our main focus in this paper was to investigate the effects of bound - state corrections , we have not included in our discussion perturbative qcd corrections from the emission of real and virtual gluons .",
    "such effects have been considered in refs .",
    "@xcite , and more recently in refs .",
    "@xcite . for inclusive decays into final states containing light quarks ,",
    "their interplay with the nonperturbative corrections considered here is rather intricate because of the presence of large sudakov double - logarithms .",
    "in particular , in @xmath84 decays the simple factorization of bound - state corrections into an integral over @xmath118 [ see ( [ buconv ] ) ] is replaced by a more complicated convolution of the structure function with a hard - scattering amplitude . for the case of @xmath214",
    "decays , however , such effects are known to be less severe .",
    "nevertheless , further investigation of radiative corrections is necessary to put our formalism on a more quantitative basis .",
    "in the last part of the paper , we have discussed some possible approaches that could be taken to extract information about the structure function from semileptonic decay spectra .",
    "we are aware that such an analysis will be complicated , due to various theoretical and experimental limitations .",
    "it is likely that the most promising approach will be to make a theory - motivated ansatz for the structure function that contains few physical parameters , and to extract these parameters from a fit to data .",
    "we are confident that it should be possible to obtain an ( approximate ) determination of the first two non - trivial moments of @xmath118 .",
    "they are proportional to the average kinetic energy of the @xmath14-quark inside the @xmath10-meson , and to the asymmetry parameter @xmath128 .",
    "these fundamental parameters are of sufficient interest to try such an analysis using the existing data on @xmath89 decays .",
