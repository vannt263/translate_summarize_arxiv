    "over the last several years , one of the most persistent problems confronting the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model has been the dichotomy between observed galaxy density profiles and those seen in cosmological simulations .",
    "the simulations generate dark matter halos with central density cusps of @xmath4 or steeper .",
    "observations of dwarf and low surface - brightness ( lsb ) galaxies , though , have usually shown that density profiles with shallow central cores , where the density is nearly constant with radius , fit the data better than cuspy profiles @xcite .",
    "this disparity is important because density profiles represent some of the strongest available constraints on the cdm simulations at small spatial scales .    because most observational errors tend to make density profiles look shallower than they actually are ,",
    "whether this disagreement is real or only apparent has been a point of contention .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite put forth the argument that most existing rotation curves have neither the spatial resolution nor the velocity resolution necessary to test the simulations adequately .",
    "@xcite extended this argument with simulations showing that even high - resolution data may be subject to numerous systematic effects that can make density profiles appear artificially shallow .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite use observations and simulations to reach the opposite conclusion : that systematic uncertainties do not significantly affect most observed rotation curves . in an attempt to resolve this debate , we began an effort to measure the density profiles of a sample of nearby dark matter - dominated galaxies at very high spatial and velocity resolution , using improved techniques to minimize the importance of systematic uncertainties .",
    "in two previous papers , we reported on our results for the dwarf spiral galaxies ngc  4605 @xcite and ngc  2976 @xcite .",
    "we found that ngc  2976 contains a nearly constant density core , while ngc  4605 has a density profile that is intermediate between the usually observed constant density cores and the cusps predicted by simulations . in this paper , we present similar analyses of three more nearby galaxies , ngc  5949 , ngc  5963 , and ngc  6689 .",
    "since our earlier study of ngc  4605 did not include a two - dimensional  velocity field , which prevented us from confirming the existence of the radial motions suggested by the co data , we also update that work with an  velocity field , additional co mapping , and new optical imaging . as before ,",
    "we use high - resolution two - dimensional velocity fields to constrain the overall mass distribution , and optical and near - infrared imaging to model and remove the baryonic contribution to the rotation curve .    in the following section ,",
    "we describe our observations and data reduction .",
    "we briefly explain our methods of modeling stellar disks and constructing tilted - ring models of the velocity fields , and refer the reader to @xcite for additional details . in  [ results ] , we present the results of our rotation curve analysis and fit the rotation curves with various functional forms . in",
    " [ discussion ] we discuss the most important implications of this work .",
    "we consider the effect on the derived density profiles of relaxing the assumption that dark matter halos are spherical in  [ triaxialeffects ] and we present our conclusions in  [ conclusions ] .",
    "the primary objective of this study is to derive very accurate rotation curves ( and hence density profiles ) of low - mass , dark matter - dominated spiral galaxies .",
    "we use two - dimensional velocity fields to measure the rotation curves in order to avoid the systematic problems associated with long - slit spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "where possible , we obtain velocity fields at multiple wavelengths ( e.g. ,  and co ) as a further guard against systematic errors .",
    "modeling and removing the stellar disk is an important step in the derivation of the dark matter density profile , so we use multicolor imaging to obtain the best available estimate of the stellar mass - to - light ratio .",
    "our target galaxies were originally selected from the co survey of nearby dwarf galaxies by leroy et al .",
    "( in preparation ) in the hope that we could map the co emission in the centers of the galaxies with the bima interferometer .",
    "only three galaxies in the survey ( ngc  2976 , ngc  4605 , and ngc  5963 ) contained enough co to produce useful interferometer maps , so we also added two more galaxies that were similar in mass ( with rotation velocities of approximately 100 km  s@xmath5 ) , distance ( approximately 10 mpc ) , inclination , and luminosity to the co - rich dwarfs .",
    "the properties of ngc  4605 are described by @xcite .",
    "this late type galaxy has an absolute magnitude of m@xmath6 and it is located @xmath7 mpc away ( m. pierce 2001 , private communication ) . while ngc  4605 is classified as a barred galaxy ( sbc ) , detailed images do not reveal evidence for the presence of a bar .",
    "ngc  5949 is an sbc galaxy of similar luminosity ( m@xmath8 ) at a larger distance .",
    "since this galaxy was included in the spiral field i - band ( sfi ) tully - fisher survey , we can use the observed parameters given by @xcite , corrected for galactic and internal extinction and for turbulent broadening of the  line , and the tully - fisher relation determined by @xcite to calculate a distance of @xmath9 mpc .",
    "ngc  5963 is an sc galaxy associated with the ngc  5866 group @xcite .",
    "the nearest large galaxy in the group is ngc  5907 , at a projected distance of 430 kpc , so it is unlikely that ngc  5963 is currently interacting with its neighbors .",
    "it has a heliocentric recession velocity of @xmath10 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "there are no photometric distance determinations for this galaxy in the literature , so it is reasonable to assume that it lies at the distance of 13 mpc implied by the hubble flow km  s@xmath5  mpc@xmath5 @xcite for the hubble constant . ] after correcting for the motion of the local group towards virgo .",
    "the uncertainty on this distance is probably of order 3 mpc . at 13 mpc ,",
    "ngc  5963 has an absolute magnitude of m@xmath11 .",
    "ngc  6689 ( also called ngc  6690 ) is listed as sbcd in ned and sbc in leda , but it is classified as an unbarred sc galaxy in the ugc @xcite , and sd in the third reference catalog of bright galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter rc3 ) .",
    "no bar is evident in any of our optical or near - infrared images .",
    "we conclude that the conflicting classifications are due to the relatively high inclination of the galaxy and that ngc  6689 does not contain a bar .",
    "the galaxy is rather similar to the others ( but more inclined ) , with a distance of 11 mpc ( again using the virgocentric - flow - corrected velocity ) and an absolute magnitude of m@xmath12 .",
    "our  observations were obtained on 2002 march 20 - 21 , 2002 may 25 - 28 , and 2003 april 15 at the 3.5 m wiyn telescope with the densepak fiber array .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for details about the instrument and spectrograph setup , respectively .",
    "we observed the galaxies at five to eleven positions , depending on the spatial extent of their  emission .",
    "these observations resulted in 350 - 650 independent velocity measurements for each galaxy .",
    "exposure times ranged from 10 minutes to 60 minutes per position .",
    "the angular resolution of these data is 4  and the velocity resolution is 13 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the densepak data were reduced as described by @xcite .",
    "the only significant change in the data reduction resulted from the replacement of the cuar comparison lamp with a thar lamp in 2002 may .",

    "our @xmath14co  ( @xmath15 )  observations of ngc  4605 and ngc  5963 were acquired using the b , c , and d configurations of the 10-element bima array @xcite between april 2001 and march 2002 .",
    "the total integration time for each galaxy was @xmath16 hours , much of which was in the most extended ( b ) configuration .",
    "the co emission in ngc  4605 extends beyond the bima primary beam diameter of @xmath17 , so we constructed a mosaic of observations made at several positions along the major axis of the galaxy .",
    "( the co observations of the central field used in this paper are the same as those of @xcite , and the other major axis fields are from the new mosaic . ) because of the greater distance of ngc  5963 , the co emission in that galaxy is much more compact and fits easily inside the primary beam .",
    "observational setup and data reduction were identical to that described by @xcite .",
    "beamsizes and sensitivities were @xmath18 ( @xmath19 pc ) and 24 mjy beam@xmath5 for the ngc  4605 central field , and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 pc ) and 70 mjy beam@xmath5 for the outlying fields of the mosaic .",

    "the scatter between the two velocity fields is 8.4 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "nevertheless , tilted - ring models based only on the co velocity field match -only tilted - ring models quite closely , so this velocity offset does not affect our results .",
    "velocity differences of this magnitude are expected to arise from flows of the ionized gas away from molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "since the  and co data appear to be both reliable and consistent with each other , the velocity field fitting described in the following section was performed on the combined velocity data for these two galaxies .",
    "we derived rotation curves for each galaxy in the same way as in @xcite . using the geometric parameters measured from the photometry ( and listed in table 1 ) , we ran the tilted - ring modeling routine ringfit  to extract the rotational , radial , and systemic velocities as a function of radius from the velocity fields .",
    "as detailed in @xcite , ringfit  is similar to the standard rotcuralgorithm @xcite in that it includes both rotation and radial motions in its ring fits , but it does not allow the pa , inclination angle , or center to vary from ring to ring .",
    "next , we applied a bootstrap technique to estimate the uncertainties in the pa , center position , and inclination angle .",
    "typical bootstrap uncertainties were 1  in ra and dec , @xmath38 in pa , and @xmath39 in inclination .",
    "for all four galaxies , we found that the kinematic and photometric values of the pa , center , and inclination angle agreed within the errors .",
    "after running the bootstrap , we constructed gaussian distributions of each of the geometric parameters , assuming that the full width at half maximum of the gaussian was equal to the bootstrap uncertainty .",
    "we then created 1000 monte carlo realizations of each rotation curve by randomly selecting a pa , center position , and inclination angle from the gaussian distributions and running ringfit  with the selected parameters as inputs .",
    "this process resulted in 1000 monte carlo rotation velocities at each radius .",
    "we then defined our final rotation curves to be the means of the monte carlo rotation velocities , and the uncertainties on the rotation curves to be the standard deviations of the monte carlo rotation velocities .",
    "the final radial velocity curves were derived in the same manner . by incorporating the uncertainties of the pa ,",
    "inclination , and center position , this technique yields more realistic rotation curve error bars than simply propagating the very small velocity uncertainties from each spectrum through the analysis .",
    "the monte carlo uncertainties ( which we refer to as systematic uncertainties ) are always much larger than the statistical uncertainties calculated by standard error propagation .",
    "the uncertainties we use for the remainder of the paper are the sum in quadrature of the systematic and statistical uncertainties .",
    "in addition to the standard use of ringfit  described in the previous section , the algorithm can also be used to decompose the velocity field into fourier components up to third order ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) . if present , these higher order terms strongly suggest the existence of a bar or other non - axisymmetric perturbation to the gravitational potential . with enough s / n , the unique signatures of a bar , spiral arms , an elliptical potential , or lopsidedness",
    "can be detected @xcite .",
    "we find weak evidence for nonzero higher order components in the velocity fields of ngc  4605 , ngc  5949 , and ngc  5963 .",
    "each galaxy has several adjacent rings in which the fits deviate from zero by @xmath42 ( all four higher - order terms for ngc  4605 , @xmath43 and @xmath40 for ngc  5949 , and @xmath43 and @xmath44 for ngc  5963 ) .",
    "typical amplitudes of the higher order components are @xmath45 km  s@xmath5 , which should not be large enough to affect our derivation of the density profiles in the following section .",
    "although the significance of these components does not generally exceed 2.5@xmath46 in a given ring , we argue that these detections are probably real because 1 ) a number of consecutive rings have consistent fourier components , and 2 ) the rotation curve uncertainties appear to be overestimated ( see  [ otherfits ] ) .",
    "ngc  6689 does not have enough data points in most of its rings to obtain reliable higher - order fits .",
    "for comparison , we find @xmath47 km  s@xmath5  @xmath43 , @xmath41 , and @xmath40 components over small ranges of radii in the ngc  2976 velocity field studied by @xcite . including terms up to third order in the tilted - ring models ( seven free ringfit  parameters instead of three )",
    "does significantly improve the reduced @xmath48 value of the fits in many cases , but this is often because the number of data points in the ring is not much larger than seven so that the fit can go through every point .",
    "more detailed descriptions of the higher order motions in each galaxy can be found in  [ comments ] .",
    "in this section we fit the rotation curves with a variety of functional forms to ascertain the shapes of the density profiles .",
    "we first consider the likely contribution of the stellar disk to the rotation curve , and then remove it from the data to reveal the rotation curve of the dark matter halo .",
    "the rotation curves produced by the tilted - ring models in  [ ringfit ] are displayed in figures [ rcfig4605]a - [ rcfig6689]a .",
    "radial velocity curves and the uncertainties on both the rotation velocities and the radial velocities are also plotted in the same figures .",
    "what we are actually interested in are the rotation curves of the _ dark matter halos _ of these galaxies , which are only equivalent to the total rotation curves shown in figures [ rcfig4605]a - [ rcfig6689]a in the minimum disk scenario ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "we therefore need to account for the contribution of the baryons to the rotation curves",
    ". an _ upper limit _ on the dark matter rotation curve ( and also the slope of the density profile ) can be found if the disk mass is zero , and a _ lower limit _ to the dark matter rotation curve and density profile slope is obtained for a maximum disk . in general , for galaxies of normal surface brightness , the minimum disk solution is physically unrealistic and the actual mass distribution is likely to be closer to the maximum disk case .",
    "we used the stellar disk rotation curves calculated in  [ stellardisks ] to construct maximum disk models . in order to avoid being unduly influenced by a single unrepresentative point in any of the observed rotation curves , we fit the inner five points of each rotation curve with a smooth function ( a power law ) .",
    "we then incrementally increased the stellar mass - to - light ratio ( the stellar rotation curve scales as @xmath50 ) until the stellar rotation curve exceeded the fit to the observed points . because of the influence of the nucleus on the stellar rotation curve of ngc  4605 , we ignored the innermost point of the fit to the observed rotation curve for that galaxy . with this procedure",
    "we defined the following maximum disk mass - to - light ratios : @xmath51 ( ngc  4605 ) , @xmath52 ( ngc  5949 ) , @xmath53 ( ngc  5963 ) , and @xmath54 ( ngc  6689 ) .",
    "typical uncertainties on these values are @xmath55 % .",
    "for all of the galaxies , these kinematic mass - to - light ratios are significantly higher than the mass - to - light ratios predicted from the galaxy colors by the @xcite population synthesis models ( see table [ mltable ] ) .",
    "we conclude the disks of these galaxies are probably somewhat submaximal . for the remainder of this paper , we adopt the following mass - to - light ratios ( the average predicted from the @xmath34 and @xmath35 colors shown in table [ mltable ] ) : @xmath56 ( ngc  4605 ) , @xmath57 ( ngc  5949 ) , @xmath58 ( ngc  5963 ) , and @xmath59 ( ngc  6689 ) .    note that since we do not have  data , we are neglecting the contribution of the gas to the rotation curve in this analysis . in galaxies",
    "the size of our targets , however , the stellar disk almost always contributes significantly more mass at the center of the galaxy than the gas does and the effect of including the gas is similar to a @xmath60 change in the stellar mass - to - light ratio @xcite .",
    "if we arbitrarily increase  to simulate this effect , the slope of the dark matter density profile ( see below ) decreases by @xmath61% . allowing the stellar disk to have a nonzero thickness ( see  [ stellardisks ] ) would offset this decrease .",
    "we can now consider the central density profile slopes of the dark matter halos of each galaxy .",
    "following the notation of @xcite , we parameterize the rotation curve by @xmath62 , which corresponds to a power law density profile : @xmath63 . allowing the stellar mass - to - light ratios to vary from zero up to the maximum disk values determined in the previous paragraph ,",

    "each of the four galaxies we observed have existing  or rotation curve data in the literature .",
    "our new data should improve on previous measurements in velocity resolution , control of systematics , angular resolution ( in the case of  measurements ) , and sensitivity , but it is useful as a first - order test of the accuracy of our data to compare the rotation curves we obtain with previous measurements .    ngc  4605 has been the subject of several rotation curve studies @xcite .",
    "all three of those studies derived very similar rotation curve shapes and amplitudes . while our methodology is different from that employed by the previous authors ( we do not produce separate fits for the approaching and receding sides of the galaxy ) , our results are qualitatively in agreement . in particular",
    ", the break in the rotation curve at a radius of 40  is quite apparent in the two recent data sets ( the @xcite rotation curve does not have enough angular resolution ) , and the maximum rotation velocities match well .",
    "the primary quantitative discrepancy is the result of the incorrect plate scale assumed by @xcite for the  spectrum they obtained . in that paper , we used a value of @xmath164  arcsec  pixel@xmath5 , but subsequent measurements showed that the actual plate scale is @xmath165  arcsec  pixel@xmath5 . correcting this error reduces the extent of the  rotation curve by 30% , but should not substantially change the power law indices measured for the rotation curve and density profile .",
    "indeed , our new rotation curve matches the old one near the center of the galaxy ( @xmath166 ) and at large radii ( @xmath167 ) . from 10  to 30  our rotation curve is a few km  s@xmath5  lower than the old one , and from 30  to 65  our rotation curve exceeds the old one by @xmath168 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the net effect of these changes is to modestly steepen the maximum disk density profile from @xmath169 @xcite to @xmath170 . given typical uncertainties on @xmath2 of 0.1 in our analysis @xcite , these results are marginally consistent . the earlier study by @xcite found a density profile of @xmath171 , also consistent with our results .",
    "the best fitting power law rotation curve at large radii still overestimates the rotation velocities in the inner region of the galaxy , as seen in @xcite and figure [ rcfig4605]a .",
    "the rotation curve of ngc  5949 has previously been measured by @xcite and @xcite with long - slit spectra .",
    "the @xcite data are consistent with the rotation curve we derive , although our rotation velocities are somewhat larger and our measurements extend to larger radii .",
    "our rotation curve matches that of @xcite within the uncertainties of the data .",
    "the kinematics of ngc  5963 have been investigated in detail in two previous papers @xcite .",
    "the shape of the  rotation curve measured by @xcite is very similar to the shape of our rotation curve ; the amplitude they derive is slightly larger ( asymptotic rotation velocity of 131 km  s@xmath5 ) , but this appears to be the result of the smaller inclination angle they used .",
    "the  rotation curve presented by @xcite is perfectly consistent with our rotation curve over the common range of radii , except that the inner two points of their rotation curve are affected by beam smearing . for the fits presented in tables [ fitdata1 ] - [ n04fitdata ] , we give results for both our data alone , and our data with the @xcite points at large radii added .",
    "the  velocity field of ngc  6689 was observed by the ghasp survey @xcite . those authors found a decidedly asymmetric rotation curve , but the filter they used for the observations may have cut off the emission line profiles on the approaching side of the galaxy .",
    "the receding side of the rotation curve presented by @xcite is consistent with the overall rotation curve we derive out to a radius of 45 , but at larger radii our rotation curve shows significantly smaller rotation velocities .        of our four target galaxies , ngc",
    "4605 is the only one that appears to deviate significantly from axisymmetry .",
    "the non - axisymmetric structures are visible both photometrically and kinematically . in broadband optical images , the galaxy contains a pronounced elongated region that is offset from its nucleus to the east .",
    "this feature , which has a somewhat higher ellipticity and a different position angle than the rest of the galaxy , persists out to k - band although it weakens with increasing wavelength . in figure",
    "[ 4605params ] , we plot the isophotal fit parameters as a function of radius ( where we now allow the isophotal center , pa , and ellipticity to vary from ring to ring ) , and the impact of the asymmetry is easily visible out to a radius of 70 .",
    "since this lopsidedness is also apparent in our  image ( the galaxy s  emission extends to twice as large a radius on its eastern side as on the western side ) and co map , it may be associated with recent star formation .",
    "the kinematic effects of this asymmetry are twofold : 1 ) the kinematic center of the galaxy is offset from the nucleus , and 2 ) the galaxy contains relatively large ( and significant ) noncircular motions .",
    "tilted - ring models of the galaxy centered on the nucleus result in a systematic trend of the systemic velocity with radius . moving the center position around",
    "so as to remove this trend and simultaneously minimize the scatter of the systemic velocities about their mean value , we found that the preferred kinematic center is southeast of the nucleus by 10 .",
    "offsets of the kinematic center of this magnitude do not significantly change the slope of the density profile .",
    "irrespective of the center position , the models also show a clear detection of radial motions in ngc  4605 .",
    "the amplitude of these motions increases to 8 km  s@xmath5  at a radius of 20 , and then stays constant out to 80 . at larger radii ( the outermost six rings )",
    "the radial motions begin to increase again , reaching 20 km  s@xmath5  at the edge of the galaxy ( @xmath172 ) .",
    "however , this increase is not very well constrained due to the poor angular coverage of the velocity data at large radii .",
    "unsurprisingly , we find small ( @xmath173 km  s@xmath5 ) but consistently nonzero @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath41 , and @xmath40 terms in the velocity field of ngc  4605 at various ranges of radii between 16  and 68 .",
    "the combination of photometric and kinematic lopsidedness suggests that the mass distribution of the galaxy indeed is lopsided , as opposed to the possibility of asymmetric star formation mentioned earlier . despite the lopsidedness of ngc  4605",
    ", the stellar disk is described well by an exponential profile , as shown in figure [ sbprofs]a .    in order to determine the potential impact of these asymmetries on our density profile analysis , we considered the maximum changes they could cause .",
    "the photometric structure makes it difficult to choose an ellipticity and position angle that are representative of the whole galaxy . in  [ stellardisks ]",
    "we used a weighted mean of the ellipticity and pa at radii between the outer edge of the asymmetric structure ( at @xmath174 ) and the edge of the galaxy . as an alternative , we tried setting the ellipticity to its maximum and minimum values over the whole galaxy , and repeated the tilted - ring modeling and isophotal fitting .",
    "we found that the rotation curve and density profile shape are largely insensitive to changes in the inclination angle . even for ellipticities as small as 0.56 ( @xmath175 ) and as large as 0.73 ( @xmath176 ) , the largest change in the derived value of @xmath2 is @xmath177 .",
    "we therefore conclude that our analysis is robust to the uncertainties introduced by the asymmetry of ngc  4605 .",
    "the surface brightness profiles of ngc  5949 are very similar to those of ngc  2976 @xcite .",
    "both galaxies contain a nucleus , a shallow ( large scale length ) inner disk , and a steep ( small scale length ) outer disk .",
    "although other disk galaxies are known to have similar structures ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the origin and physical significance of these two apparently distinct disks are not understood .",
    "nevertheless , there is no reason to doubt that our thin - disk approximation is valid for this galaxy , so the shape of the stellar rotation curve we calculated should be accurate . due to the high level of symmetry of ngc  5949 in all bands ,",
    "the photometric inclination and pa are extremely well constrained , leading to very small systematic uncertainties on the rotation curve .",
    "it is worth noting that ngc  5949 is the only galaxy in our sample in which the shape of the stellar rotation curve is very similar to the shape of the observed rotation curve .",
    "therefore , it is possible to model this galaxy with essentially only a stellar disk and barely any contribution from dark matter . the stellar mass - to - light ratio required to accomplish this is @xmath178 , 30 % higher than the derived maximum disk value .",
    "our tilted - ring modeling of ngc  5949 reveals a small radial component to the velocity field with modest significance .",
    "these radial motions are detected beginning at a radius of 20 , and remain present out to the edge of the galaxy .",
    "the maximum amplitude is 8 km  s@xmath5 , and there are a total of six consecutive rings that have radial motions deviating from zero by at least @xmath76 . since the radial motions are @xmath179 of the rotation speed at all radii , they should not affect our mass models of the galaxy .",
    "note that because we do not know which side of the galaxy is closer to us , we can not determine whether the detected radial motions correspond to inflowing or outflowing material .",
    "we also detect a @xmath180 km  s@xmath5  @xmath43 term from 24  to 36  and a @xmath181 km  s@xmath5  @xmath40 term from 12  to 32 .      unlike the other three galaxies , the luminous component of ngc  5963 does not contain an easily identifiable exponential disk . at the center of the galaxy is a bright , elongated bar - like feature about 4  across . outside this source",
    "is a small disk - like region ( 500 pc in radius ) with four tightly wound spiral arms . at a radius of 15  ( 950 pc )",
    "the surface brightness profile begins a steep decline , falling by nearly 3 magnitudes over 18 . surrounding this region",
    "is an lsb , nearly exponential disk that extends out to a radius of at least 120  ( see figure [ sbprofs]c ) .",
    "the inner spiral arms can be traced out into this outer disk at very low surface brightness levels .",
    "it is difficult to interpret this surface brightness profile in terms of the standard model of a disk galaxy .",
    "ordinarily , one might assume that the bright central region of ngc  5963 is a bulge that just happens to be at the center of an unusually faint disk .",
    "the clear presence of spiral arms in this region , however , suggests that even here the galaxy is highly flattened .",
    "one possibility is that this structure is a pseudobulge that has formed via secular evolution of the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the most sensible way to derive the stellar rotation curve in this case is to apply our standard assumption that the disk can be treated as infinitesimally thin .",
    "the assumption that the stellar mass - to - light ratio remains constant throughout this galaxy may not be correct , but since the stars are far from dominating the gravitational potential for reasonable mass - to - light ratios this should not substantially change our results .",
    "ngc  5963 also contains noncircular motions .",
    "the radial term in the tilted - ring fits deviates from zero by more than @xmath76 in five rings , from 12  to 30 .",
    "the radial motions reach as high as 15 km  s@xmath5  in this region , before beginning to oscillate about zero ( with large uncertainties ) at larger radii .",
    "the second - order fourier terms in this galaxy both have amplitudes of @xmath181 km  s@xmath5  from radii of @xmath182 ( @xmath44 ) and @xmath183 ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the high inclination of ngc  6689 makes our images and surface brightness profiles less revealing of details of its structure .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that this galaxy contains an exponential disk and a central light excess that could be attributable to a bulge or a bar .",
    "no bar is evident in our images , but as we noted in  [ targets ] , some catalogs classify the galaxy as barred .    despite the large inclination angle ,",
    "the observed  emission lines from ngc  6689 are well represented by gaussian fits .",
    "this implies that sightlines through ngc  6689 generally only intersect a single  region , which is consistent with the appearance of the galaxy in a narrow band  image .",
    "therefore , it is not necessary to use an envelope - tracing method ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) instead of gaussian fits to extract rotation velocities from the spectra .",
    "neither our standard tilted - ring model nor the higher order harmonic fits detected any deviations from circular rotation in ngc  6689 . to some degree , this is likely due to the inclination of the galaxy , which limits our resolving power along the minor axis where radial motions are most prominent .",
    "nevertheless , a radial component of @xmath184 km  s@xmath5  as we found in the other three galaxies should have been detected if present .",
    "the primary goal of this study is to determine as accurately as possible the inner density profiles of the dark matter halos of the galaxies we observed . at radii of @xmath185 kpc ,",
    "does the dark matter density continue to increase , as predicted by nfw and numerous other theoretical studies ? or are the density profiles flat , with constant density cores , as most previous observers have concluded ?",
    "are the variations in density profile shape from galaxy to galaxy as small as the simulations suggest ?      for two of the galaxies in our sample ( note that for the remainder of the paper we include ngc  2976 in our analysis so that we have a total sample of five galaxies ) , these questions are easy to answer .",
    "ngc  2976 , as @xcite showed , unambiguously contains a constant density core .",
    "an @xmath0 power law ( constant density ) provides an excellent fit to the rotation curve .",
    "a pseudo - isothermal profile with a core comparable to the optical size of the galaxy also produces a good fit .",
    "ngc  5963 , on the other hand , quite clearly has a very steep central density profile .",
    "a power law with a slope of @xmath1 fits the rotation curve very well , and an nfw fit with @xmath186 kpc and a concentration parameter of 14.9 is nearly as good .",
    "a pseudo - isothermal fit is significantly inferior .    for the remaining three galaxies ,",
    "the interpretation of the fit results is not nearly as straightforward .",
    "nfw fits to the disk - subtracted rotation curves can be carried out , but the fit parameters are not usefully constrained . power laws with slopes between @xmath187 ( ngc  4605 ) and @xmath188 ( ngc  5949 ) fit the rotation curves well , but they are matched in each case by pseudo - isothermal profile fits with comparable or better reduced @xmath48 values .    how can a rotation curve be simultaneously consistent with both a pseudo - isothermal halo and an @xmath189 power law density profile ? as shown by @xcite , the difference between the rotation curves associated with these density profiles tends to be smaller than typical observational uncertainties , even with the high velocity resolution of our data .",
    "the pseudo - isothermal profile has a slope that varies continuously from 0 ( constant density ) at its center to -2 ( isothermal ) at large radii . a power law , of course , has a constant slope that ( for our fits ) is intermediate between these two values . that both profiles fit the data suggests that 1 ) the mean density profile slope over the observed region is equal to the value preferred by the power law , but that 2 ) the slope changes with radius , which is better described by the pseudo - isothermal profile .",
    "previous studies have often assumed that if a pseudo - isothermal rotation curve fits the data , then the galaxy in question must contain a constant - density core .",
    "our successful fits with the modified pseudo - isothermal profile ( equation [ modiso ] ) show that this assumption is not correct .",
    "even when a pseudo - isothermal profile fits well , other density profiles with steeper central slopes may provide equally good fits .",
    "taken together , these observational results argue against the proposition that all galaxies share a universal density profile .",
    "common two - parameter profiles other than a power law can not fit all of the galaxies in our sample , and even for power law fits the solutions span the range from constant - density to very cuspy . if a universal density profile exists , the scatter from halo to halo is large .",
    "the idea of a universal dark matter density profile traces back to nfw , and the most recent simulations continue to support this picture @xcite .",
    "the favored functional form of the universal profile , however , has not been agreed upon . for several years",
    "the debate focused on the exact value of the central cusp slope , but with the increasing resolution of the simulations it now seems that this question may be the wrong one to ask . the highest resolution @xmath190cdm simulations reveal that dark matter density profiles do not converge to an asymptotic central slope @xcite .",
    "instead , the logarithmic slope continues to get shallower at smaller radii , and the best procedure for extrapolating the profiles to radii below the resolution limits pc , so another factor of @xmath191 improvement in the resolution is needed before the simulations reach the scales probed by observations .",
    "] of the simulations is not clear .",
    "the new density profile proposed by @xcite ( equation [ nfw2 ] ) fits simulated dark matter halos more accurately and over a wider radial range than does the original nfw profile .",
    "all of the halos presented by @xcite are well described by the new profile .",
    "a key difference between this profile and the classic nfw or @xcite profiles is that there is no well - defined central cusp .",
    "the density reaches a finite central value rather than diverging . on observationally relevant scales ( 100 to 1000 pc ) ,",
    "though , the density profiles remain rather steep .",
    "observations like ours with a resolution of tens or hundreds of parsecs would be expected to find density cusps only marginally shallower than an nfw profile . only on _ sub - parsec _ scales",
    "does the logarithmic slope of this profile reach even @xmath141 @xcite .",
    "when the fits to equation [ nfw2 ] for various halos are rescaled by the characteristic density ( @xmath148 ) and radius ( @xmath149 ) of each halo , they are all essentially identical , corroborating the hypothesis of a universal density profile .",
    "@xcite confirm the ability of this functional form to fit their own independently simulated halos .",

    "since ngc  5963 represents the exception rather than the rule , the question is , are all galaxies formed with cuspy density profiles and most lose them , or did an unusual event during the evolution of ngc  5963 caused its density profile to become so steep ?",
    "the key to answering this question is identifying what about ngc  5963 makes it unique .",
    "a number of galaxy properties from our sample are summarized in table [ galaxyprops ] . among these galaxies ,",
    "ngc  5963 has the highest central surface brightness , despite its very low surface brightness outer disk .",
    "it also has the most unusual surface brightness profile ( see  [ n5963 ] ) , although the significance of this is not clear .",
    "ngc  5963 is at the brighter end of the luminosity range of our targets , but the total span between the five galaxies is only @xmath215 magnitude . it does have the largest rotation velocity , and therefore the highest mass , among our sample .",
    "other than mass , the most obvious distinction between ngc  5963 and the other galaxies is the sharp transition between the inner and outer surface brightness profiles .",
    "this causes the derived stellar disk rotation curve to peak at small radii ( @xmath216 ) and then drop steeply , making the outer parts of the galaxy highly dark matter dominated ( see figure [ rcfig5963]b ) .",
    "although this photometric structure may be related to the steep density profile of ngc  5963 , we do not know its physical origin .",
    "if the galaxy really does contain a pseudobulge , then the processes that have funneled baryons toward the center of the galaxy could also have caused the dark matter to become more centrally concentrated .",
    "it is also noteworthy that high resolution two - dimensional velocity fields and deep multicolor imaging are not necessary to recognize the unique dark matter density profile of ngc  5963 . using lower resolution  data , a long - slit spectrum of modest resolution , and photographic @xmath217 and @xmath26 band imaging more than 15 years ago",
    ", @xcite already concluded that this galaxy probably contains `` an unusually centrally concentrated and massive halo '' . since high - resolution cdm simulations of galaxy structure",
    "had not yet been done @xcite could not generalize this result into any broader implications for dark matter or galaxy formation .",
    "our study is not alone in finding that pseudo - isothermal profiles fit many rotation curves better than do nfw profiles .",
    "a number of previous authors have reached similar conclusions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we emphasize , however , that the observation that pseudo - isothermal fits produce lower reduced @xmath48 values than nfw or moore profiles does not demonstrate the presence of a constant - density core .",
    "we showed in  [ otherfits ] that in many cases power law density profiles with intermediate ( @xmath218 ) slopes provide comparable fits .",
    "a modified pseudo - isothermal profile with an @xmath219 central cusp ( equation [ modiso ] ) also fits these rotation curves as well as a true pseudo - isothermal profile with a constant - density core does . since current theories of galaxy formation",
    "do not lead naturally to either cores or pseudo - isothermal density profiles , a preference for constant - density cores over shallow density cusps is not justified .",
    "whether these galaxies actually contain a central region of constant density or if they have shallow cusps can not be determined from the present data despite the high resolution of our measurements .",
    "we do agree with past studies that for most galaxies the nfw form does not fit the inner density profile very effectively ( see figures [ rcfig4605]b-[rcfig6689]b ) .",
    "when @xmath144 and @xmath135 are constrained to stay roughly in the range expected from simulations , the @xmath48 values for nfw fits are generally rather high .",
    "we also point out , however , that the nfw fit parameters are quite poorly constrained unless the observations extend well into the flat part of the rotation curve .",
    "if there are only a few data points on the flat part of the rotation curve ( especially when these data points have the largest uncertainties , as is often the case ) , they do not provide significant leverage on the fit .",
    "in such cases , the nfw scale radius and virial radius ( or any other pair of parameters that can be used to describe an nfw profile ) become completely degenerate . in order to obtain accurate estimates of the nfw fit parameters",
    ", our results suggest that @xmath220 % of the observed part of a galaxy must have a nearly flat rotation curve .      combining this study with our previous analysis of ngc  2976",
    ", we have shown that the five galaxies in our sample have density profiles with a wide range of central slopes .",
    "if we fit the data with power laws , we find that three galaxies have central cusps of @xmath221 , while the other two galaxies have very different central slopes ( @xmath222 and @xmath1 ) . of the outliers ,",
    "ngc  2976 is a satellite of m  81 , and thus may have been subject to tidal stripping .",
    "there are suggestions in the literature that tidal stripping acts to remove density cusps @xcite , but the most recent simulations find that the central density slope is not altered by tidal effects @xcite .",
    "it is not clear why ngc  5963 differs so strongly from the other galaxies .",
    "these fits demonstrate that while galaxies with steep central density cusps do exist , they are not shared by all galaxies . furthermore , no single value of the central slope can describe all five of the rotation curves in our sample .",
    "on the other hand , if we consider the pseudo - isothermal fit results ( as most previous observational studies have done ) , we find that good fits can be obtained for four of the five galaxies ( see table [ fitdata1 ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that these galaxies all have central densities within a factor of seven of each other . only for ngc  5963",
    "is the quality of the pseudo - isothermal fit sufficiently poor that a constant - density core can be excluded .",
    "the rotation curves of the other four galaxies are consistent with cores , but all except ngc  2976 are also consistent with cusps .",
    "the implication of these findings is that some previous studies may have overestimated the disagreement between their data and the cdm simulations .",
    "based on these results , we reach the following conclusions :    * first , the observed variation in density profile slopes from halo to halo is much larger than expected from the simulations .",
    "we also find that none of the commonly used density profile functional forms can describe all five galaxies . * second , most galaxies have density profiles significantly shallower than the @xmath223 central cusps preferred by the simulations .",
    "nevertheless , the difference between the central slopes we measure and the theoretical values is much smaller than suggested by most previous studies . * and third",
    ", some galaxies do contain @xmath224 cusps with an overall density profile that follows the nfw form , hinting that it may still be possible to reconcile the results of the pure dark matter cosmological simulations with observations .",
    "do these differences between the observations and the simulations indicate a fundamental problem with the cdm paradigm ?",
    "probably not .",
    "a great many plausible theoretical explanations have been proposed in attempts to understand this problem , and a few of the recent ideas are mentioned below .",
    "@xcite suggested based on phase - space arguments that cdm density profiles should have @xmath225 cusps , very similar to the average we measure .",
    "@xcite found that the dark matter halos of simulated dwarf galaxies have shallower cusps than those of massive galaxies . in a similar experiment , however , @xcite reached the opposite conclusion , so the degree to which dwarf galaxy density profiles are expected to match those of large galaxies has not yet been settled .",
    "@xcite showed that major mergers leave cuspy remnants unless both precursors had cores , so at least in the case of pure dark matter halos , mergers can not destroy cusps .",
    "baryonic processes , however , probably can ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "even the dark matter itself may be able to flatten cuspy density profiles ; @xcite argued that energy deposition by merging dark matter substructures can puff up central cusps into shallower density profiles .",
    "this effect might have escaped notice in previous simulations due to insufficient resolution or overmerging ( unrealistic destruction of subhalos in dense regions ) .",
    "finally , @xcite have shown that if dark matter halos are significantly triaxial ( see  [ triaxialeffects ] ) , for some viewing angles the derived density profiles can appear much shallower than the actual density profiles .    since we have shown that cuspy density profiles are consistent with a large fraction of our sample , and in light of the variety of potential effects not currently accounted for in the simulations that could change the predicted density profiles ,",
    "there is little reason to conclude at this point that the density profile controversy represents a crisis for cdm .",
    "almost every previous observational study of density profiles and rotation curves has assumed that dark matter halos are spherical .",
    "cdm simulations , however , suggest that dark matter halos are triaxial @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , very few observations of individual galaxies are available to test this prediction .",
    "several polar - ring galaxies have been studied , with results ranging from axis ratios as small as 0.3 - 0.4 up to axis ratios of 1 ( spherical halos ) @xcite .",
    "a variety of techniques suggest that the gravitational potential of the dark matter halo of the milky way is close to spherical @xcite . despite the scarcity of reliable constraints on individual halo ellipticities ,",
    "statistical arguments provide a way to determine the average shape of galaxy halos .",
    "@xcite show that the observed scatter in the tully - fisher ( tf ) relation places a strong upper limit on the allowed ellipticities of spiral galaxy disks .",
    "even if _ all _ of the tf scatter is caused by elongated disks , the mean disk ellipticity is required to be less than 0.1 .",
    "more likely , the scatter is a result of a combination of effects , indicating that on average disk ellipticities are 0.05 or smaller . in this section",
    "we consider the effects triaxial halos could have on the velocity fields we observe .",
    "galaxy disks are expected to be oriented such that the disk lies in the plane described by the major and intermediate axes of the halo , with the @xmath226-direction pointing along the halo minor axis @xcite .",
    "we first consider the effect of this flattening of the halo , under the assumption that halo shape in the disk plane is circular .",
    "the rotation velocity of a disk in such an oblate spheroidal halo is given by equation 2 - 91 in @xcite : @xmath227    where @xmath228 is the density profile of the halo in the spheroidal coordinate @xmath229 ( defined by @xmath230 ) and @xmath231 is the eccentricity of the spheroid . for any density profile , this integral can be evaluated numerically to give the rotation curve for various degrees of oblateness .",
    "we performed this calculation for spheroidal power laws ( @xmath232 ) and nfw profiles ( @xmath233 ) .",
    "the change from a spherical halo to an oblate one could affect both the shape of the rotation curve and its amplitude .",
    "we find that as the halo becomes flatter ( @xmath234 ) the amplitude of the rotation curve increases ( as expected , since the mass becomes concentrated closer to the disk ) .",
    "we also find that the shape of the rotation curve is completely independent of the halo flattening for a power law ; the same power law index for the rotation curve ( and density profile ) is derived for any value of @xmath231 . for an nfw density profile",
    "the shape of the rotation curve changes very subtly with eccentricity ( the peak of the rotation curve shifts to smaller radii as the halo becomes flatter ) , but the inner slope of the rotation curve is essentially unaffected .      in the previous subsection , we showed that the flattening of the halo does not alter the observed density profile for a circular disk .",
    "we now remove the assumption that the disk is circular and study the effects of disk ellipticity on the observed velocity field .",
    "four of the five galaxies in our sample show evidence for a radial component to their velocity fields . in two of these ,",
    "the radial motions are detected very strongly ; for the other two the significance of the radial term is lower , although it is still confirmed at @xmath235 % confidence .",
    "other recent studies have also begun to find significant numbers of galaxies with noncircular motions @xcite . a large majority of the galaxies studied by these authors ( and us )",
    "are not barred .",
    "however , of the galaxies in which observations could have detected radial motions , nearly all indeed appear to contain them .",
    "are radial components to the velocity fields ubiquitous in late - type spiral galaxies ? what is the cause of these motions ?      since there is no strong evidence for bars in the four galaxies where we detect noncircular motions , other sources of these motions should be considered .",
    "first , we note that the observed noncircular motions are dominated by the radial component .",
    "the simplest possibility is that the galaxies contain strong radial flows directed towards their centers . given the observed magnitude of the radial motions at a radius of @xmath215 kpc and an assumed volume density for the gas ( 1 h atom @xmath236 ) , if the radial motions actually represent a net inflow of gas we conservatively estimate that all of the gas would accumulate within a @xmath215 kpc radius of the galaxy centers in 1 - 3 gyr .",
    "the star formation rate over the same region is at least an order of magnitude too small to consume the inflowing gas .",
    "we therefore conclude that this interpretation is not viable .",
    "the most intriguing remaining explanation is that the gas is moving on elliptical orbits , which could result from the influence of a triaxial dark matter halo .    in a disk galaxy with a triaxial dark matter",
    "halo , the potential in the plane of the disk will in general be elliptical .",
    "the closed orbits in such a potential are also ellipses , which means that the observed line - of - sight velocities of an elliptical disk will differ from pure circular rotation . this problem has been considered in detail by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that an elliptical potential induces components in the velocity field proportional to the ellipticity and the angle between the long axis of the ellipse and the observer s line of sight . adopting their formalism ( @xcite , equation a10 ) , we have the following relations : @xmath237v_{c}\\sin{i } \\\\ \\hat s_{1 } = \\left[\\left ( \\frac{5-q^{2}}{4(1-q^{2 } ) } - a\\right ) \\epsilon_{r } \\sin{2\\phi_{obs}}\\right]v_{c}\\sin{i } , \\label{s1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath238 and @xmath239 are the @xmath240 ( rotation ) and @xmath241 ( radial ) components of the tilted - ring model , respectively .",
    "the hat symbols indicate that these quantities are derived under the assumption of circular orbits , and will therefore differ systematically from the true values if the potential is elliptical .",
    "these formulae are valid when the rotation curve , @xmath242 , can be represented as a power - law with index @xmath243 , which we have shown is a reasonable assumption for these galaxies .",
    "@xmath243 is related to @xmath244 by @xmath245 .",
    "@xmath246 is the axis ratio of the galaxy , which we take from the photometry , @xmath247 is the angle between the long axis of the potential and the line of sight , and @xmath248 is the ellipticity of the orbit .",
    "the relationship between the ellipticity of the potential , @xmath249 , and that of the orbit , @xmath248 , is given by @xcite : @xmath250    in order for us to make the simplifying assumption that the apparent rotation velocities are equal to the true rotation velocities ( i.e. , that the orbits are nearly circular ) , the following condition must be met : @xmath251    in this case , equation [ c1 ] reduces to @xmath252 .",
    "substituting this expression into equation [ s1 ] and solving for the potential ellipticity yields @xmath253    thus , if the observed noncircular motions are indeed due to an elliptical potential in the plane of the disk , the amplitudes of the circular and radial motions put a direct constraint on the ellipticity .",
    "note that since @xmath254 this constraint is actually a _ lower limit _ on @xmath248 . using the known values of @xmath246 and @xmath244 , and the results of our tilted - ring models for @xmath238 and @xmath239",
    ", we calculate @xmath255 as a function of radius for each galaxy .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ ellipticity ] .",
    "ngc  4605 , with its very strongly detected radial motions , has a large and nearly constant ellipticity that deviates significantly from zero beginning at a radius of 20 .",
    "the mean value of @xmath255 over the entire galaxy is @xmath256 , making the disk of this galaxy substantially elliptical . from equation [ potentialeqn ] , we see that @xmath257 , so the ellipticity of the potential is at least 0.03 .",
    "@xmath255 is detected at the @xmath258 level in ngc  5949 and ngc  5963 .",
    "we find that @xmath259 for ngc  5949 and @xmath260 for ngc  5963 .",
    "we do not detect any evidence for elliptical orbits in ngc  6689 : @xmath261 .",
    "ngc  2976 is the only galaxy in which the ellipticity is not constant with radius .",
    "this could suggest that either the halo structure is more complicated in this galaxy ( e.g. , the axis ratios of the halo change with radius ) , or that its radial motions may be caused by something other than triaxiality .",
    "if the halo of ngc  2976 is triaxial , the mean ellipticity of the disk orbits is @xmath262 .",
    "given the determination of @xmath263 , we can now go back and confirm that the assumption stated in equation [ circcondition ] ( that the difference between the apparent and true rotation velocities is small ) was justified . as long as the ellipticity is modest ( @xmath264 , which requires that the viewing angle be larger than @xmath265 for most of these galaxies",
    ") , this condition will be satisfied .",
    "note , however , that for ngc  4605 @xmath248 may be larger than this value .",
    "these calculations show that , if the observed radial motions are indeed due to halo triaxiality , the lower limit on the mean potential ellipticity is of order a few percent .",
    "since the scatter in the tf relation indicates that the average ellipticity of the potential has a strict upper limit of 0.1 @xcite , the ellipticities are now constrained within a relatively narrow range .",
    "cdm simulations predict that the dark matter halos of galaxies similar in mass to our targets should have axis ratios of @xmath266 and @xmath267 @xcite , which would suggest larger ellipticities than we measure .",
    "@xcite find somewhat less triaxial halos with @xmath268 and @xmath269 for halos with masses of @xmath270 . adding gas cooling to the simulations , however ,",
    "may make the inner regions of the halo much more spherical @xcite . with observations of a larger sample of galaxies ,",
    "it may be possible to obtain robust constraints on the three - dimensional shapes of galaxy halos , which would then provide another strong test of cdm simulations on small scales .",
    "we have used two - dimensional co and  velocity fields , sampled at high spatial resolution and high spectral resolution , to constrain the dark matter density profiles of four nearby , low - mass , late - type galaxies .",
    "we obtained rotation curves from the data cubes by constructing tilted - ring models , and found that three of the four galaxies contain radial motions in addition to rotation . combining these data with",
    "the observations of ngc  2976 presented by @xcite gave us a sample of five galaxies to study .",
    "for each galaxy we constructed a model of the stellar disk and investigated the density profile of the dark matter halo under varying assumptions about the stellar mass - to - light ratio . in most cases , over the range of plausible mass - to - light ratios , the dark matter density profiles do not change significantly . for the mass - to - light ratios indicated by the galaxy colors",
    ", we found that the five galaxies span a range of central density profile slopes from @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "the mean slope is @xmath3 , with a dispersion of 0.44 .",
    "neither of the standard density profile functional forms ( pseudo - isothermal and nfw ) is able to adequately fit all five galaxies .",
    "the scatter in slope that we observe is three times larger than that seen in the simulations , and the mean slope is smaller than predicted .",
    "we do note , however , that ngc  5963 is the first low - mass disk galaxy in which a cuspy density profile of the predicted form is confirmed , while shallower alternative profile shapes are ruled out .",
    "although these results still indicate significant disagreements between cdm simulations and the properties of real galaxies , there are also some differences between the findings of this paper and those of previous observational analyses .",
    "many authors have concluded that density profiles with constant - density cores fit the rotation curves of dwarf and lsb galaxies better than cuspy density profiles do ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "typical results from these studies are that the distribution of density profile slopes is @xmath271 @xcite .",
    "some other studies agreed that cored profiles generally fit the data better , but argued that this effect is primarily the result of systematic uncertainties in the observations @xcite .",
    "when we fit power laws to the rotation curves we find significantly steeper density profile slopes on average than previous authors did , although both pseudo - isothermal density profiles ( constant - density cores ) and relatively cuspy profiles are consistent with our data . despite our disagreement on the value of the mean slope ,",
    "we agree with other recent studies that found that dark matter density profiles span a wide range of slopes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    what is responsible for the steeper slope that we find ?",
    "one important element of our study is that the two - dimensional velocity fields , high spatial resolution , and target selection we employed significantly reduce the impact of systematic uncertainties on our results @xcite . as an illustration of this point",
    ", @xcite showed that to obtain tight constraints on density profile slopes , at least one of the three following conditions must be met : 1 ) the uncertainties on the rotation curve must be @xmath272 km  s@xmath5 , 2 ) the rotation curve must extend out beyond 20% of the virial radius , and 3 ) the rotation curve must extend inward to radii less than @xmath180% of the virial radius .",
    "while we do not reach the velocity precision of criterion ( 1 ) , we approach it as closely as feasible , with typical systematic uncertainties as small as @xmath180 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "although higher velocity resolution spectroscopy is possible , our velocity measurements have already run into the limit imposed by the small - scale random motions of @xmath191 km  s@xmath5  that most galaxies appear to contain . without  observations at large radii , we also fail to meet criterion ( 2 ) , but our high spatial resolution does allow us to satisfy criterion ( 3 ) .",
    "galaxies with masses similar to those studied here may have virial radii of 50 - 75 kpc @xcite , so even for our most distant targets our @xmath273 pc resolution probes well within 2% of the virial radius .",
    "in addition , we explored functional forms for the density profiles other than the standard nfw / pseudo - isothermal dichotomy , thereby demonstrating that good pseudo - isothermal fits in general do not rule out cuspy density profiles . given these new results , we conclude that while the discrepancies between cdm and galaxy rotation curves may not be as severe as previously thought , improved simulations are needed in order to determine whether the theoretical and observational findings can be brought into agreement .    finally , we considered the origin of the noncircular motions that are now being detected regularly in disk galaxies .",
    "a number of previous authors have showed that a triaxial dark matter halo can produce exactly the observed effect on the gas orbits . under the assumption that halo triaxiality is causing the noncircular motions",
