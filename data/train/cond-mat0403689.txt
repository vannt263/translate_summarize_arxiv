    "the vanadium oxides @xcite comprise compounds with different formal vanadium valency stages , which reach from two in vo , three in v@xmath0o@xmath1 , and four in vo@xmath0 to five in v@xmath0o@xmath5 .",
    "in addition to these configurations mixed valent compounds can be synthesized . amongst the latter the so - called magnli phases , defined by the general stoichiometric formula @xmath6 are of special interest since they give rise to a homologous series of compounds with closely related crystal structures .",
    "this type of homologous series has been reported for the first time by magnli for the molybdenum oxides @xcite .",
    "nowadays additional magnli series are known for the vanadium , titanium , niobium , and tungsten oxides .",
    "the first structural characterization of vanadium magnli compounds by means of x - ray investigations traces back to andersson and jahnberg @xcite in 1963 .",
    "as equation ( [ eq23 ] ) indicates , the magnli phases take an intermediary position between v@xmath0o@xmath1 and vo@xmath0 , thus between the valency stages three and four .",
    "in addition to the chemical relationsship , the crystal structures of the magnli phases actually consist of rutile and corundum - type blocks and consequently show structural affinity to both the dioxide and the sesquioxide . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we study the structural relations between these materials in detail  discovering the potential of gradually transferring the crystal structure of vo@xmath0 into that of v@xmath0o@xmath1 by making use of the magnli phases .",
    "this observation allows for a comprehensive understanding of all these compounds .    as a function of temperature each magnli phase undergoes a metal - insulator transition ( mit ) , except for v@xmath7o@xmath8 , which is metallic at all temperatures .",
    "the mits are of first order and accompanied by distinct structural transformations .",
    "table [ tab1 ] summarizes transition temperatures , inferred from electrical resistivity measurements by kachi et al .",
    "@xcite , and formal v @xmath9 charges , varying from two in v@xmath0o@xmath1 to one in vo@xmath0 . in an ionic picture",
    "a metal atom contributes three @xmath9 and two @xmath10 electrons , whereas an oxygen atom accepts two @xmath11 electrons .",
    "as the magnli phases are characterized by vanadium atoms in mixed valent states , the electronic properties were expected to be influenced by charge ordering .",
    "although this is interesting from both the experimental and theoretical point of view , only few studies are reported in the literature .",
    "figure [ pic36 ] illustrates the behaviour of the mit temperatures listed in table [ tab1 ] as a function of the vanadium - oxygen ratio .",

    "it suffices to apply @xmath14 crystallographically inequivalent classes and place altogether 24 empty spheres in the triclinic unit cell .",
    "this keeps the linear overlap of physical spheres below @xmath15% and the overlap of any pair of physical and empty spheres below @xmath16% .",
    "unit cells entering the lda calculation comprise 46 spheres ; table [ tab8 ] denotes the radii of the physical spheres and the calculated valence charges .",
    "all technical details of the calculation are the same as for v@xmath17o@xmath18 .    by comparing @xmath19 to @xmath20 the influence of the chain center atoms on the electronic properties of the magnli phases",
    "will be investigated quantitatively in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "such a comparison is of special interest since the former compound is the only member of the magnli series , which does not undergo an mit .",
    "in contrast , v@xmath21o@xmath22 exhibits an mit at @xmath23k accompanied by structural distortions .",
    "v@xmath7o@xmath8 and both v@xmath21o@xmath22 phases crystallize in the triclinic space group @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) with the vanadium and oxygen atoms at the wyckoff positions ( 2i ) : @xmath26 .",
    "canfield @xcite reported lattice parameters related to the unit cell of le  page and strobel , see equation ( [ eq25 ] ) .",
    "for v@xmath7o@xmath8 we have @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "for the room temperature structure of v@xmath21o@xmath22 these constants amount to @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , whereas the low temperature configuration is defined by the values @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
    "the latter unit cell is exceptional because it accounts for a superstructure evolving in v@xmath21o@xmath22 at low temperatures , which complicates the considerations .",
    "however , for the high temperature structures we proceed analogous with the previous analysis of v@xmath17o@xmath18 . a detailed discussion of the structural input for the subsequently presented electronic structure calculations has been given in @xcite .",
    "we use the positional parameters measured by canfield .",
    "alternative crystallographic studies of v@xmath7o@xmath8 at room temperature were performed by horiuchi et al .",
    "in this section we analyze the mit of v@xmath17o@xmath18 @xcite . changes of the electronic structure at the transition are discussed in relation to the structural transformations occuring simultaneously .",
    "the study will benefit from our unified representation of the crystal structures of the magnli phases as well as of vo@xmath0 and v@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "we will succeed in grouping the electronic bands of v@xmath17o@xmath18 into states behaving similarly to either the dioxide or the sesquioxide .",
    "therefore it is possible to analyze the phase transitions of the different compounds on the basis of a common point of view , which helps us to gain insight into the delicate interplay of electron - lattice coupling and electronic correlations and their influence on the respective mits .",
    "we start our considerations with a survey of the partial densities of states shown in figure [ pic27 ] , which arise from the lda calculations for high and low temperature v@xmath17o@xmath18 .",
    "the low temperature antiferromagnetism is not considered for the reasons discussed earlier . in the high temperature case",
    "we observe three groups of bands in the energy intervals from @xmath46ev to @xmath47ev , from @xmath48ev to @xmath49ev , and from @xmath50ev to @xmath51ev . on entering the low temperature phase the lowest group broadens considerably , reaching from @xmath52ev to @xmath53ev , whereas the other groups are almost not altered .",
    "due to substantial structural similarities to the dioxide / sesquioxide it is not surprising that the electronic structure of v@xmath17o@xmath18 resembles the expectations of the molecular orbital picture as discussed for the former compounds .",
    "characteristic @xmath54 and @xmath55-type overlap of v @xmath9 and o @xmath11 states gives rise to bonding - antibonding split molecular orbitals in the energetical order @xmath54-@xmath55-@xmath56-@xmath57 .",
    "bonding states are identified with the lowest , @xmath56 states with the middle , and @xmath57 states with the highest group of bands .",
    "since the metal atoms are octahedrally coordinated , the @xmath57 and @xmath56 bands display @xmath58 and @xmath59 symmetry , respectively . because of 12 v and 22 o atoms per unit cell there are @xmath60 vanadium @xmath9 @xmath58 , @xmath61 vanadium @xmath9 @xmath59 , and @xmath62 oxygen @xmath11 bands . in agreement with the molecular orbital picture and",
    "the findings for vo@xmath0 and v@xmath0o@xmath1 the energetically lowest structure in figure [ pic27 ] predominantly traces back to o @xmath11 states , whereas the other groups mainly originate from v @xmath9 states . due to a different electron count",
    ", the filling of the @xmath59 levels is between that of vo@xmath0 and v@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "contributions of vanadium and oxygen in regions dominated by the respective other states are due to @xmath63-@xmath64 hybridization . in regions corresponding to @xmath54-type v - o overlap , i.e.  in the @xmath58 range and in the lower half of the o @xmath11 range",
    ", they are stronger .",
    "larger @xmath59 admixtures in the @xmath58 interval of v@xmath17o@xmath18 , compared to vo@xmath0 , point to increased deviations from an ideal octahedral coordination .",
    "the distortions agree more with those of v@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "differences between the partial densities of states calculated for the high and low temperature structure are small .     and o @xmath11 densities of states ( dos ) per vanadium atom resulting from the high ( 298k ) and low ( 20k ) temperature crystal structure of v@xmath17o@xmath18 are compared.,width=377 ]    no energy gap is observed for the low temperature structure .",
    "instead , the structural modifications accompanying the mit leave the dos at the fermi energy almost unaffected .",
    "this is not surprising as for neither the insulating phase of vo@xmath0 nor the afi phase of v@xmath0o@xmath1 did the calculations succeed in reproducing an energy gap , which fact was attributed to shortcomings of the lda .",
    "however , as has been demonstrated for the dioxide , this does not prevent us from understandig the mechanism of the mit @xcite .",
    "since we study the relations between electronic states and local atomic environments as well as the modification of this relationship at the transition , the lda limitations do not affect the following considerations .",
    "the structural modifications of v@xmath17o@xmath18 at @xmath65k are mainly concerned with a strong v4-v6 dimerization in the 2 - 4 - 6 vanadium chain , see figure [ pic19 ] . while the v4-v6 bond length decreases from @xmath66  to @xmath67 ,",
    "the v2-v4 and v6-v6 distances grow from @xmath68to @xmath69  and from @xmath70  to @xmath71 , respectively . as a consequence , two isolated v4-v6     @xmath59 densities of states ( dos ) per metal atom for the high and the low temperature crystal structure of v@xmath17o@xmath18 : sites v1 and v2 .",
    "the crystal structure is depicted in figure [ pic19 ] and the orbitals refer to the local rotated reference frame.,width=377 ]    vanadium pairs arise    , but for the vanadium sites v3/v4.,width=377 ]    and the chain end atoms ( v2 ) separate from the rest of the vanadium chain .    , but for the vanadium sites v5/v6.,width=377 ]    in the 1 - 3 - 5 chain dimerization effects yield a shortened v5-v5 bond length both above and below the mit .",
    "obviously , in the insulating phase the v5-v5 pair separates even more from the evolving v1-v3 pairs .",
    "all these modifications of the crystal structure resemble the pairing effects known from the peierls distortion in monoclinic vo@xmath0 .",
    "due to finite chains in the case of v@xmath17o@xmath18 it is not surprising to find more complicated distortion patterns ; the end atoms affect the v - v pairing in the whole chain .",
    "the monoclinic phase of vo@xmath0 is characterized not only by metal - metal pairing but also by zigzag - type in - plane displacements of the vanadium atoms along the local @xmath72-axis , thus along the diagonals of the rutile basal planes .",
    "while metal sites in the rutile structure coincide with the centers of the surrounding oxygen octahedra , they are shifted away from these positions by @xmath73  in the distorted configuration , thus giving rise to stronger v - o overlap .",
    "equivalent shifts away from the centers of the octahedra are observed for the sites v3 , v4 , v5 , and v6 in v@xmath17o@xmath18 .",
    "the distance between vanadium atoms and octahedral centers grows from @xmath74  to @xmath75(v3 ) , from @xmath76  to @xmath77  ( v4 ) , from @xmath78  to @xmath77  ( v5 ) , and from @xmath79  to @xmath80  ( v6 ) , respectively . actually , the major part of the shifts is oriented perpendicular to the @xmath81-axis .",
    "although the metal sites in the high temperature phase do not coincide with octhedral centers , the relative changes at the mit are similar to vo@xmath0 .",
    "interestingly , the high temperature lateral displacements are larger for the intermediate sites v3 and v4 than for the center atoms v5 and v6 .",
    "this is due to a slight rotation of the vanadium chains away from the @xmath81-axis , which is present in each magnli phase . because of the rotation the chain end sites v1 and v2 shift away from their nearest neighbours along @xmath82  resembling the vanadium anti - dimerization of v@xmath0o@xmath1 parallel to the @xmath83-axis . here",
    "the displacements of the metal sites with respect to octahedral centers amount to @xmath84  ( pm phase ) and @xmath85  ( afi phase ) . for v@xmath17o@xmath18 these values",
    "are @xmath86  in the metallic and @xmath80  in the insulating phase . hence , even concerning the details of the local distortion , chain centers and ends behave as their parent structures vo@xmath0 and v@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "next we decompose the v @xmath9 @xmath59 group of states into its symmetry components .",
    "figures [ pic23 ] to [ pic25 ] give site - projected partial @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 densities of states for the six inequivalent metal sites",
    "v1, ... ,v6 .",
    "for each site the presentation of the data refers to the local rotated reference frame , which was defined in the discussion of the dioxide .",
    "the rutile reference frame is useful since the local octahedral coordinations of the metal sites in v@xmath17o@xmath18 resemble the rutile arrangement , see the preceding sections .",
    "we turn to the @xmath59 states of the vanadium atoms v4 , v5 , and v6 , which are involved in strong dioxide - like displacements .",
    "thus the site - projected densities of states are similar to one another and resemble the dos of rutile and monoclinic vo@xmath0 . note the two peak structure weakly indicated in the high temperature v4 @xmath87 dos due to @xmath54-type v - v bonding along the metal chains . in the low temperature phase the v4-v6 dimerization causes an increased splitting of the dos into bonding and antibonding branches located at energies of @xmath90ev and @xmath91ev .",
    "the @xmath88 and @xmath89 densities of states undergo energetical upshifts due to the antiferroelectric displacements of the v4 atoms perpendicular to @xmath81 , which raise the overlap of v @xmath9 and o @xmath11 states and thus the @xmath55-@xmath56 splitting .",
    "similar to vo@xmath0 , the energetical separation of the @xmath92 band and the remaining @xmath93 states is increased but not complete in the low temperature results .    the situation is similar for the v6 atoms , which participate in the v4-v6 pairs .",
    "therefore the bonding and antibonding branches of the @xmath87 dos appear at the same energies as for the v4 site . however , in the low temperature configuration the splitting is more pronounced due to additional v6-v6 bonding . as in the case of v4 the energetical upshift of the @xmath88/@xmath89 dos",
    "is easily observed , especially directly below the fermi level . while the @xmath89 dos of v4/v6 gives rise to a broad single peak",
    ", we find a distinct splitting of the @xmath88 dos in contributions centered at about @xmath94ev and @xmath95ev for the high temperature structure .",
    "the splitting is understood by taking into account metal - metal bonding parallel to @xmath96 . across octahedral faces typical sequences v2-v6-v4",
    "appear in this direction , as obvious from figure [ pic9 ] . due to a peak in the low temperature v6 @xmath88 dos at about @xmath91ev , which is not present in the respective v4 dos but reappears in the v2 dos , we can assume increased v2-v6 bonding along @xmath96 at low temperatures .",
    "the @xmath87 and @xmath88 densities of states of atom v5 show strong bonding - antibonding splitting , which hardly changes at the transition .",
    "the shape of the @xmath87 dos is understood in terms of constant v5-v5 bonding .",
    "in contrast , splitting of the @xmath88 dos traces back to v - v overlap along @xmath96 .",
    "the energetical upshift of these states at the mit is pronounced and has the same origin as discussed for v4 and v6 . in total ,",
    "the partial v4 , v5 , and v6 densities of states display characteristic features known from the dimerization and the zigzag - type displacements in monoclinic vo@xmath0 and are understood in terms of the latter compound .",
    "in contrast to the chain center atoms v4 , v5 , and v6 the end atoms v1 and v2 are characterized by a sesquioxide - like local environment .",
    "thus they are involved in v - v bonding across shared octahedral faces connecting the 1 - 3 - 5 to the 2 - 4 - 6 layers , but they are not subject to dimerization along @xmath81 . hence , except for small peaks and shoulders around @xmath90ev and from @xmath95ev to @xmath97ev ( reminiscent of the chain center @xmath87 densities of states ) the v1/v2 @xmath87 dos consists of a single broad peak extending from @xmath94ev to @xmath98ev .",
    "the subpeaks observed in this energy region miss counterparts in the dos of any neighbouring vanadium atom .",
    "since such peaks are indicative of metal - metal bonding we conclude , in consistence with the reported v - v distances , that chain end atoms are well separated from the remainder of the chains .",
    "thus the @xmath87 states can be regarded as localized .",
    "while chain center @xmath87 orbitals predominantly mediate v - v overlap along @xmath81 , this interaction is suppressed for v1 and v2 for geometrical reasons .",
    "hence the chain end",
    "@xmath87 states behave as the @xmath89 states , which generally give rise to reduced ( @xmath55-type ) metal - metal overlap along the chains . in both phases",
    "the center of weight of the v1 @xmath87 dos is noticeably higher than that of the v2 @xmath87 dos . because of nearest neighbours along @xmath82 the @xmath88 orbitals are important for interpreting the chain end atoms since these states cause v - v bonding parallel to both @xmath82 and @xmath96 .",
    "the v1 and v2 @xmath88 states display bonding - antibonding splitting both above and below the transition . for the insulating modification",
    "this separation is more pronounced with peaks directly above the fermi energy and around @xmath99ev .",
    "however , so far we are not able to distinguish between the effects of the different metal - metal interactions . whether the shape of the @xmath88 dos indicates bonding along @xmath82 or @xmath96 or both",
    "will be dealt with later .",
    "the question is of interest as the @xmath82-direction of v@xmath17o@xmath18 corresponds to the @xmath83-axis of the corundum structure .",
    "hence the splitting of the @xmath88 states is equivalent to the @xmath100 splitting in v@xmath0o@xmath1 and we can gain new insight into the mit of the sesquioxide .",
    "the partial v1 and v2 @xmath59 densities of states resemble each other due to similar coordinations .",
    "they and are interpreted in accordance with v@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "atom v3 is exceptional as its @xmath59 dos can neither be interpreted by means of dioxide - like dimerization in the vanadium chains nor by sesquioxide - like metal - metal overlap along @xmath82 .",
    "the second fact is simply due to the absence of adjacent vanadium sites , which allow for overlap between the 1 - 3 - 5 and 2 - 4 - 6 layers .",
    "nevertheless , all components of the @xmath59 dos are similar to those of sites v1 and v2 .",
    "the @xmath87 and @xmath89 densities of states consist of broad single peaks .",
    "reminiscent of bonding and antibonding branches in the corresponding v5 dos we find satellite peaks at @xmath101ev and a shoulder at @xmath95ev in the high temperature phase .",
    "the compact shape of the @xmath89 dos again is not surprising due to the small v - v overlap this orbital is involved in , not only for v3 but also for the other vanadium atoms .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath88 partial dos reveals a distinct double peak structure in both phases , indicative of bonding - antibonding splitting . at first glance",
    "this finding is difficult to understand as geometrically no vanadium partner along @xmath82 exists , which could participate in v - v bonding .",
    "however , this puzzling situation is resolved by reconsidering the possibility of v - v interaction perpendicular to the chains and simultaneously perpendicular to the @xmath100-direction , namely along @xmath96 . as mentioned before",
    ", there are finite vanadium sequences consisting of three atoms ( v1-v5-v3 ) , where the distance between neighbouring atoms corresponds to the longer rutile lattice constant .",
    "to be more precise , these bond lengths amount to @xmath102/@xmath103  ( v1-v5 ) and @xmath104/@xmath105  ( v5-v3 ) for the high / low temperature configuration .",
    "the associated values in the v2-v6-v4 sequences are @xmath103/@xmath106  ( v2-v6 ) and @xmath107/@xmath108  ( v6-v4 ) .",
    "since each vanadium atom in v@xmath17o@xmath18 participates in @xmath54-type overlap along @xmath96 , the bonding - antibonding splitting of the @xmath88 states is present not only for site v3 .",
    "this has important implications for the interpretation of the v1/v2 @xmath88 dos because interactions parallel to @xmath82 and @xmath96 add to the bonding - antibonding splitting of these states .",
    "the respective antibonding peaks of v1 and v2 are merged at high temperatures but split up at the mit . due to the v - v overlap along @xmath96 site v3",
    "resembles the electronic properties of the chain end sites , although its coordination does not allow for @xmath100-like bonding .",
    "therefore v - v bonding across the vanadium layers is not the only source for a splitting of the @xmath88 dos . despite differing bond lengths hardly any difference between v - v overlap via octahedral faces within and perpendicular to the layers",
    "is found . supporting results of elfimov et al .",
    "@xcite , v - v couplings other than the @xmath82-like are important for the shape of the @xmath100 bands in v@xmath0o@xmath1 .    while v - o overlap places the v @xmath9 @xmath59 states near the fermi level , the detailed electronic features of the orbitals , and thus the mit of v@xmath17o@xmath18 , are fundamentally influenced by the local metal - metal coordination .",
    "the small variations of the oxygen sublattice at the mit barely affect the shape of any @xmath59 dos , whereas modifications of the v - v bond lengths are important .",
    "depending on the coordination , the local electronic properties of the vanadium atoms are typical for vo@xmath0 or v@xmath0o@xmath1 and it is reasonable to regard the partial densities of states as local quantities . at the chain centers ( v4 , v5 , v6 ) dimerization and antiferroelectric - like displacements via strong electron - lattice interaction cause a splitting of the @xmath87 dos and an energetical upshift of the @xmath93 states at the mit . for atom v5 the former effect is already present at high temperatures .",
    "summarizing , chain center atoms behave analogous with vo@xmath0 . in contrast , at the chain ends ( v1 , v2 , v3 ) the @xmath87 orbitals are characterized by strongly reduced metal - metal overlap and show a localized nature .",
    "the shape of the @xmath87 dos is closely related to the @xmath89 dos . due to the strong localization , electronic correlations are important for the chain end @xmath87 states . being subject only to in - layer v - v overlap , the partial v3 @xmath88 dos shows bonding - antibonding splitting similar to the atoms v1 and v2 , which have an additional nearest neighbour across the layers .",
    "therefore the in - plane v - v interaction is at least as important as the perpendicular overlap . in conclusion",
    ", the sesquioxide - like regions of the v@xmath17o@xmath18 crystal appear to be susceptible to electronic correlations for geometrical reasons .",
    "structural variations at the mit leave all three components of the @xmath59 partial dos almost unchanged , thus reflecting close relations to v@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "we interpret the phase transition of v@xmath17o@xmath18 as resulting from a combination of electron - lattice interaction and electronic correlations . due to the different atomic arrangements in vo@xmath0 and v@xmath0o@xmath1-like regions",
    "neither an embedded peierls instability nor correlations can account for the mit of v@xmath17o@xmath18 on their own .",
    "going back to the calculated valence charges at the vanadium and oxygen sites summarized in table [ tab7 ] we investigate possible charge ordering .",
    "different atomic spheres radii , necessary to fulfill the requirements of the atomic sphere approximation , prohibit a quantitative comparison of the valence charges but allow still for qualitative results . for the high temparature modification",
    "there are about @xmath109 electrons less at sites v1 and v3 than at sites v2 and v4 , whereas the charges at the central sites v5 and v6 coincide .",
    "the atomic spheres comprise almost the same space for the pairs v1/v2 , v3/v4 , and v5/v6 , respectively . in general , the calculated @xmath110/@xmath111 v @xmath9 valence electrons contradict the simple ionic picture predicting an average of @xmath112 electrons per vanadium atom . instead of v@xmath113 ions we find v@xmath114 and v@xmath115 configurations , which is not surprising due to covalent v - o bonding .",
    "oxygen spheres comprise about four @xmath11 electrons .",
    "further electrons enter the empty spheres and hence the open space between vanadium and oxygen .",
    "the accuracy of comparing calculated valences is limited as the assignment of charge to specific sites is arbitrary to some degree .",
    "we assign charge within an atomic sphere to the respective atomic site .",
    "electrons entering interstitial empty spheres can not be assigned to any specific atom .",
    "importantly , differences in the occupation of equivalent states can be identified with a much higher accuracy .",
    "thus the @xmath9 charge of both v1 and v3 is significantly reduced .",
    "in addition , we obtain the same result for the low temperature phase , where all vanadium spheres show similar radii .",
    "the valence charge at sites v1 , v3 , and v5 is roughly @xmath109 electrons smaller than at sites v2 , v4 , and v6 , resulting in a charge transfer of @xmath116 electrons per site from the 1 - 3 - 5 to the 2 - 4 - 6 chain above and below the mit .",
    "the different electron count in the two metal chains is related to their crystallographic inequivalence . while donor atoms ( to some extend ) approach the vo@xmath0 charge configuration , the acceptor chain resembles more the v@xmath0o@xmath1 filling .",
    "the electronic configurations of vo@xmath0 and v@xmath0o@xmath1 seem preferable to a mixture of both .",
    "however , chain end sites do not generally gain excess charge at the expense of the dioxide - like chain centers .",
    "hence it is not the electron count of a specific atom but the local coordination which determines the behaviour at the phase transition .",
    "the calculated valence charges contradict v@xmath117/v@xmath118 states , but confirm two kinds of metal valences ; they point to smaller charge differences .",
    "deviations from the ionic picture are consistent with susceptibility data by gossard et al .",
    "@xcite , whereas for the insulating phase we do not find the proposed charge ordering .",
    "the above findings have important implications for understanding v@xmath0o@xmath1 as the chain end atoms of the magnli phases resemble the local metal coordination of this material . according to the previous discussion",
    "the electronic properties of v@xmath17o@xmath18 are influenced by essentially three effects .",
    "first , the center atoms of the vanadium chains along @xmath81 reflect characteristics of the embedded peierls instability responsible for the mit in vo@xmath0 .",
    "second , the localization of the chain end @xmath87 orbitals leaves them susceptible to electronic correlations .",
    "third , the chain end @xmath88 orbitals to roughly equal parts are subject to both metal - metal bonding within ( along @xmath96 ) and perpendicular to ( along @xmath82 ) the vanadium layers .",
    "as vanadium chains in the case of v@xmath0o@xmath1 ( @xmath119 ) degenerate to pairs , a dioxide - like peierls instability can not contribute as a matter of principle .",
    "however , the localized nature of the @xmath87 orbitals and the importance of strong v - v coupling along @xmath96 should be transferred to the sesquioxide . due to the high crystal symmetry both effects could not be analyzed in previous studies of v@xmath0o@xmath1 . as a consequence of the broken symmetry in the magnei phases , combined with a closely related coordination of appropriate vanadium atoms , they are accessible to the study of v@xmath17o@xmath18 .",
    "the splitting of the @xmath100-like states due to metal - metal overlap along @xmath83 therefore seems to be less important than commonly assumed for v@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the compound v@xmath13o@xmath7 is suitable for studying chain end effects since the metal chains here comprise only four atoms @xcite .",
    "analogous with the preceding section we discuss the electronic structure and its changes at the mit in relation to the simultaneous structural transformations .",
    "applying the knowledge established in the study of v@xmath17o@xmath18 we can group the electronic bands into states behaving either vo@xmath0 or v@xmath0o@xmath1-like .",
    "partial v @xmath9 and o @xmath11 densities of states arising from the high and low temperature structure are shown in figure [ pic26 ] .",
    "as for vo@xmath0 , v@xmath0o@xmath1 , and v@xmath17o@xmath18 , we find three separated groups of electronic bands .",
    "recalling the molecular orbital picture , the bonding - antibonding splitting due to v - o overlap , and the discussions in the previous sections , we identify the bonding states with those bands extending from @xmath121ev to @xmath122ev at high temperatures ; they shift to the region from @xmath46ev to @xmath123ev below the mit .",
    "further groups of bands correspond to @xmath56 and @xmath57 states .",
    "hence they are dominated by vanadium states and separate into @xmath59 and @xmath58 contributions due to the octahedral coordination of the metal sites . while the @xmath59 group is observed between @xmath48ev and @xmath124ev in the metallic phase , its upper edge shifts to @xmath125ev at low temperatures .",
    "the @xmath58 group starts at @xmath50ev in both phases , but it extends to @xmath126ev instead of @xmath127ev in the insulating phase . since the unit cell of v@xmath13o@xmath7 contains 8 vanadium and 14 oxygen atoms we have @xmath128 vanadium @xmath9 @xmath58 , @xmath129 vanadium @xmath9 @xmath59 , and @xmath130 oxygen @xmath11 bands .",
    "hybridization between v @xmath9 and o @xmath11 orbitals results in finite contributions of vanadium in the bonding and of oxygen in the antibonding region .",
    "as expected , such hybridization effects are stronger for @xmath54-type v - o overlap .",
    "moreover , there is a finite @xmath59 dos in the @xmath58 dominated region .",
    "as the magnitude of this admixture equals the result for v@xmath17o@xmath18 , deviations from an ideal octahedral coordination of the vanadium sites are similar in both compounds and likewise similar to the sesquioxide .",
    "all these results for v@xmath13o@xmath7 fit very well into the picture developed in the preceding sections . due to the formal v @xmath9 charge of @xmath131 electrons per metal site",
    ", v@xmath13o@xmath7 systematically is between v@xmath17o@xmath18 and v@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "therefore the v @xmath9 @xmath59 orbitals are filled to a somewhat larger extent than for v@xmath17o@xmath18 , which is confirmed by figures [ pic27 ] and [ pic26 ] .",
    "although the calculation misses an energy gap for the experimental insulating phase , the lda shortcomings again do not affect an investigation of relations between structural and electronic properties or the analysis of implications for the mit .",
    "while the previous analysis of v@xmath17o@xmath18 gave strong indications for a predominant influence of     and o @xmath11 densities of states ( dos ) per vanadium atom resulting from the high ( 298k ) and low ( 120k ) temperature structure of the compound v@xmath13o@xmath7.,width=377 ]    electron - lattice interaction in dioxide - like and of electronic correlations in sesquioxide - like regions of the crystal , we expect that the investigation of the sesquioxide - related member v@xmath13o@xmath7 will allow for conclusions about the mit of v@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "separated by oxygen atoms , inequivalent vanadium layers alternate along the @xmath82-axis of v@xmath13o@xmath7 , comprising the atoms v1/v3 or v2/v4 . due to this alternation and due to relative shifts of the metal 4-chains along @xmath81",
    "the end sites v1 and v2 are located on top of each other , see figure [ pic20 ] .",
    "we again refer the v @xmath9 orbitals to local coordinate systems with the @xmath72-axis oriented parallel to the apical axis of the local octahedron and the @xmath132-axis parallel to @xmath81 , respectively . using this reference frame , a decomposition of the v @xmath9 @xmath59 group of states into the symmetry components @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 is depicted in figures [ pic17 ] and [ pic18 ]",
    "the site - projected partial densities of states are given for the vanadium sites v1 , v2 , v3 , and v4 . in the following ,",
    "we concentrate on the results for the 1 - 3 chain , which is motivated by the fact that the modifications of the local surroundings of atom v1 at the mit are similar to those known from v@xmath0o@xmath1 . according to the data denoted in figure [ pic20 ] the v1-v2 and v1-v3 distances increase at the mit , as do the distances @xmath133 and @xmath134 in the sesquioxide at the pm - afi transition , see figure [ pic10 ] .",
    "since in the latter compound all vanadium atoms are crystallographically equivalent a complete symmetry analysis of the electronic states can not be performed . however , this is possible for v@xmath13o@xmath7 .",
    "as demonstrated in the case of v@xmath17o@xmath18 , the local atomic arrangements are related to the electronic structures of the respective sites .",
    "therefore the v1 site of v@xmath13o@xmath7 allows us to study the influence of the structural changes at the mit of v@xmath0o@xmath1 in more detail than in a direct investigation .",
    "changes in the v@xmath13o@xmath7 crystal structure at 250k are mainly concerned with strong dimerization     @xmath59 densities of states ( dos ) per metal atom for the high and the low temperature crystal structure of v@xmath13o@xmath7 : sites v1 and v2 .",
    "the crystal structure is depicted in figure [ pic20 ] and the orbitals refer to the local rotated reference frame.,width=377 ]    evolving in both the 1 - 3 and 2 - 4 metal chain , see figure [ pic20 ] . while the v3-v3 and v2-v4 bond    , but for the vanadium sites v3/v4.,width=377 ]    lengths shorten from @xmath135  and @xmath136  to @xmath137  and @xmath138 , the remaining distances v1-v3 and v4-v4 elongate from @xmath139  and @xmath136  to @xmath140 , respectively .",
    "hence we find an isolated v3-v3 pair in the first and two v2-v4 pairs in the second chain . in the 1 - 3 chain",
    "the end atoms decouple to a large degree from the central v3-v3 pair .",
    "the modifications resemble pairing effects associated with the embedded peierls instability of the dioxide .",
    "nevertheless , the end atoms of the 1 - 3 chain likewise show structural changes known from the symmetry breaking pm - afi transition of v@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the distance between v1 and the nearest vanadium site along @xmath81 increases by @xmath141 , which is half the shift found for the sesquioxide . note that the dominating structural changes in v@xmath0o@xmath1 do not appear along @xmath82 but along @xmath81 .",
    "in contrast to the 1 - 3 chain , the end atoms of the 2 - 4 chain increase the coupling to adjacent in - chain sites below the mit . thus they show the opposite trend than found in v@xmath0o@xmath1 and are not suitable for investigating the latter material .    beyond metal - metal pairing also zigzag - type in - plane",
    "displacements of the metal sites are present in the v@xmath13o@xmath7 structure .",
    "the distances between vanadium atoms and octahedral centers amount to @xmath142/@xmath80  ( v1 ) , @xmath86/@xmath143  ( v2 ) , @xmath144/@xmath76  ( v3 ) , and @xmath145/@xmath146  ( v4 ) in the high / low temperature modification .",
    "apparently , the average bond length does not increase at the transition , which contrasts findings for vo@xmath0 and v@xmath17o@xmath18 , hence confirming the sesquioxide - like character of v@xmath13o@xmath7 .",
    "because of a slight rotation of the vanadium chains away from the @xmath81-axis , the lateral displacement is much larger for the chain end sites v1 and v2 .",
    "the rotation enables the latter sites to increase their distance along @xmath82 , which reflects the anti - dimerization of v@xmath0o@xmath1 parallel to @xmath83 . in general ,",
    "the main part of the zigzag - type displacements is oriented perpendicular to @xmath81 .",
    "atom v2 shifts almost along the apical axis of its octahedron , i.e.  along the local @xmath72-axis , whereas atom v1 moves perpendicular to the local @xmath72-axis .",
    "however , because of the rotation of the local coordinate system by @xmath147 around the @xmath81-axis , the displacements occur in every chain along the same direction . on closer inspection",
    "we recognize the motions to be antiparallel , which increases the in - pair v1-v2 bond length .",
    "altogether , the zigzag - type antiferroelectric mode of the 2 - 4 chain resembles the behaviour of the dioxide , whereas the 1 - 3 chain reveals distinct differences above as well as below the mit .",
    "in retrospect , this interrelation applies also to v@xmath17o@xmath18 because the displacements of the dioxide - like 1 - 3 - 5 chain point along the local @xmath72-axis rather than those of the 2 - 4 - 6 chain .",
    "decomposing the v @xmath9 @xmath59 partial dos , we observe in figures [ pic17 ] and [ pic18 ] for the @xmath87 states a similar behaviour as in vo@xmath0 .",
    "due to strong @xmath54-type v - v bonding along the vanadium chains the chain center sites show distinct splitting of the @xmath87 dos . in the case of atom",
    "v3 a broad peak is observed from roughly @xmath48ev to @xmath148ev and a sharp peak at @xmath95ev . because of weaker v4-v4 bonding the splitting is smaller for the v4 site with peaks at approximately @xmath149ev and @xmath150ev .",
    "the chain end atoms v1 and v2 are less affected by in - chain metal - metal bonding and consequently display a more compact @xmath87 dos . at low temperatures",
    "the behaviour of both metal chains changes substantially .",
    "increased v - v dimerization yields enhanced bonding - antibonding splitting of the v3 @xmath87 dos .",
    "additionally , by virtue of reduced v1-v3 overlap along @xmath81 the v1 @xmath87 states tend to localize .",
    "accordingly , the v1 @xmath87 dos sharpens and develops a pronounced peak near the fermi energy at low temperatures . while the v4-v4 distance grows by @xmath116  below the transition , the coupling of the v4 atoms to the chain end sites increases .",
    "the reduced v2-v4 bond length causes stronger bonding - antibonding splitting of the v2 @xmath87 dos .",
    "modifications of the vanadium @xmath89 partial dos at the transition are less significant .",
    "they consist mainly of an energetical up and downshift of the states as observed for atoms v1 and v2 , respectively .",
    "such shifts are due to increased and decreased displacements perpendicular to @xmath81 . moving vanadium atoms laterally off the centers of gravity of their oxygen octahedra modifies the overlap between v @xmath9 and o @xmath11 orbitals .",
    "the oxygen sublattice itself is hardly affected by the structural transformations .",
    "therefore the shifts of the @xmath89 states can be understood in terms of a zigzag - type antiferroelectric distortion of the vanadium chains . as the distortion is reduced for the chain center sites v3 and v4 ,",
    "see the former discussion , the effects are barely visible in the dos . in the prototypical case of vo@xmath0 lateral displacements",
    "are found only in the low temperature monoclinic phase , whereas v@xmath13o@xmath7 reveals them similar at all temperatures .",
    "since metal - metal bonding is less important for @xmath89 orbitals no bonding - antibonding splitting is visible .",
    "the situation is more complicated for @xmath88 orbitals , which are considerably influenced by different kinds of hybridization .",
    "recall from our earlier investigations that these electrons can be involved in metal - metal overlap across octahedral faces both along @xmath82 and @xmath96 .",
    "moreover , antiferroelectric - like displacements of the vanadium atoms lead to increased overlap between v @xmath9 and o @xmath11 states , which causes energetical upshift of the antibonding vanadium dominated states . in the case of v@xmath13o@xmath7",
    "the atoms v3 and v4 display neither relevant antiferroelectric shifts nor v - v interaction parallel to the @xmath82-axis .",
    "there are simply no nearest metal neighbours in this direction . as a consequence ,",
    "the pronounced double peak structure of the v3/v4 @xmath88 dos indicates bonding - antibonding splitting due to v1-v3 and v2-v4 overlap , respectively , which is true at high and low temperatures .",
    "analogous with the finite metal 3-chains of v@xmath17o@xmath18 along @xmath96 we are confronted with vanadium pairs giving rise to v1-v3 and v2-v4 bonding across shared octahedral faces .",
    "in contrast to the central vanadium atoms the chain end atoms v1 and v2 , apart from participating in v1-v3/v2-v4 overlap along @xmath96 , take part in v1-v2 bonding along @xmath82 . the partial v1 and v2 @xmath88 densities of states thus consist of features reminiscent of the sites v2/v3 and v1/v4 , respectively . being subject to two different types of metal - metal overlap ,",
    "the @xmath88 orbitals of the chain end atoms undergo two intertwining bonding - antibonding splittings , which lead to complicated triangular dos shapes , especially in the low temperture phase , and resemble the shape of the v @xmath9 @xmath100 dos of v@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "in addition , the form is affected by the discussed zigzag - type displacements of the chain end atoms , which intensify the metal - oxygen bonding . as a consequence , the center of gravity of the v1/v2 @xmath88 dos shifts to higher energies below the mit .",
    "changes in the shape of the v2 @xmath88 dos yield a closer resemblance to the v1 @xmath88 dos , which can be traced back to an improved coupling between the chain end atoms at low temperatures . as the relative displacements of the sites v1 and v2 along @xmath81",
    "are reduced , the v1-v2 bond penetrates the octahedral faces along @xmath82 more favorably and the overlap becomes more effective .    in conclusion ,",
    "the electronic structure of v@xmath13o@xmath7 is strongly influenced by the coordination of the metal sites , as previously reported for v@xmath17o@xmath18 .",
    "generally , while the overlap of v @xmath9 and o @xmath11 orbitals places the v @xmath9 @xmath59 states close to the fermi energy , the details of the electronic structure are subject to metal - metal bonding .",
    "in particular , one finds a distinct bonding - antibonding splitting of the @xmath87 states at the chain center sites . in the low temperature phase",
    "the same applies to atom v2 .",
    "all these splittings are analogous with the corresponding orbitals in vo@xmath0 and v@xmath17o@xmath18 , where they likewise are enforced by v - v dimerization . in contrast",
    ", the v1 @xmath87 dos reveals a compact structure and a distinct sharpening below the mit as these states hardly take part in the dimerization along the metal chains .",
    "hence they may be susceptible to electronic correlations . for the @xmath89 and @xmath88 states we find noticeable response to the displacements of the metal atoms perpendicular to @xmath81 . as the atoms move relative to the octahedral centers , states with @xmath89 and @xmath88 symmetry display energetical up and downshifts in the vanadium and oxygen dominated regions , respectively .",
    "however , the @xmath88 dos is affected mainly by the v - v bonding across shared octahedral faces .",
    "chain center sites are subject to bonding only along @xmath96 and show a characteristic two peak structure .",
    "in contrast , atoms v1 and v2 additionally take part in @xmath88-type overlap along @xmath82 , leading to densities of states similar to the @xmath100 dos of v@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the latter orbital mediates v - v bonding along @xmath151 .",
    "similar to the v@xmath17o@xmath18 findings , the lda results indicate small charge transfer between the two inequivalent metal chains .",
    "recall the limitations of assigning charge to specific atomic sites as discussed in section [ sec1 ] . according to table [ tab8 ]",
    "the v2 sites comprise @xmath109 electrons less than the v1 sites in the high temperature modification of v@xmath13o@xmath7 , while v3 and v4 show similar values .",
    "note that in the pairs v1/v2 and v3/v4 the sphere radii are almost equal .",
    "the interpretation of the low temperature results is a little more complicated .",
    "however , taking into account the various sphere radii one can state reduced charges for both v2 and v4 , where the charge deficit is @xmath109 electrons per site .",
    "of course , the calculated values of @xmath152-@xmath153 v @xmath9 valence electrons do not agree with the ionic picture predicting @xmath131 electrons per metal atom  but due to covalent v - o bonding this deviation is not surprising . in comparison to v@xmath17o@xmath18 the atomic spheres of v@xmath13o@xmath7 comprise slightly more charge , which reflects the position of the compound in the magnli series .",
    "we find no significant differences in the charges of the particular oxygen spheres since each of them contains about four @xmath11 electrons .",
    "further electrons enter the interstitial empty spheres and thus are difficult to classify in vanadium and oxygen - type contributions .",
    "altogether we observe a charge transfer of about @xmath116 electrons per site from the 2 - 4 to the 1 - 3 chain . in the high temperature phase only the chain end sites",
    "are involved in the transfer . as in the case of v@xmath17o@xmath18",
    "the different electron count is related to the crystallographical inequivalence of the two vanadium chains .",
    "while the 2 - 4 donator chain becomes slightly more vo@xmath0-like , the 1 - 3 acceptor chain to some extent approaches the v@xmath0o@xmath1 configuration . these lda findings qualitatively confirm x - ray results by marezio et al .",
    "@xcite , who applied an ionic picture and reported chains of v@xmath117 and v@xmath118 ions running parallel to the @xmath81-axis .",
    "although an ordered arrangement of varying valence charges is confirmed by the calculation , the charge discrepancy is much smaller due to covalent bonding .",
    "nuclear magnetic resonance findings by gossard et al .",
    "@xcite support chains of differently charged atoms along @xmath81 but indicate incomplete differentiation into 3 + and 4 + valences .",
    "the authors observed a slightly increased charge ordering below the mit , which is confirmed by the lda results .",
    "as in other magnli phases , particularly in v@xmath17o@xmath18 , the electronic structure of v@xmath13o@xmath7 is a mixture of features characteristic of either vanadium dioxide or sesquioxide .",
    "the local atomic environment of the chain end site v1 bears close resemblance to the v@xmath0o@xmath1 structure as it is subject to an increased separation from its vanadium neighbours at the mit .",
    "we are thus in a position to transfer some of the above conclusions for v@xmath13o@xmath7 to v@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "first , v - v bonding across octahedral faces along @xmath82 seems to have the major effect on the shape of the @xmath88 dos of v@xmath13o@xmath7 and thus on the shape of the @xmath100 dos of v@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "however , also the v - v hybridization across the faces parallel to @xmath96 is large since it leads to strong splitting of the electronic states .",
    "second , due to the reduced metal - metal interaction across the octahedral edges parallel to @xmath81 the vanadium @xmath87 states are substantially localized and undergo further localization at the transition .",
    "this supports previous work by dernier @xcite , who concluded from a comparison of pure / doped v@xmath0o@xmath1 and of cr@xmath0o@xmath1 that the metallic properties of v@xmath0o@xmath1 are connected to v - v hybridization across shared octahedral edges rather than to hopping processes in the vanadium pairs along @xmath83 . from this point of view",
    "the mit arises from structural changes occuring at the transition . via strong",
    "electron - phonon coupling the structural distortions translate into a narrowing of the bands perpendicular to the @xmath83-axis .",
    "note that the decoupling of the vanadium atoms parallel to the @xmath81-direction is even stronger for the sesquioxide than for v@xmath13o@xmath7 since the corresponding bond length shortens by @xmath154  instead of @xmath141 .",
    "the band narrowing eventually paves the way for increased influence of electronic correlations in the insulating configuration .",
    "so far our treatment of v@xmath0o@xmath1 concerned only the symmetry breaking pm - afi transition , which is accompanied by substantial modifications of the interatomic v - v spacings . however , pfalzer et al .",
    "@xcite reported on local symmetry breaking in the pi phase of aluminium doped v@xmath0o@xmath1 , giving rise to similar structural and electronic properties of the afi and pi phase at least on a local scale . due to the local distortions one may expect a closely related scenario for both the pm - afi and the pm - pi transition . in general , the reduction of the dispersion perpendicular to @xmath83 seems to play a key role for the mit of v@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "finally , addressing the systematics inherent in the magnli series we are interested in effects of the chain length .",
    "variation of the length systematically modifies the ratio of dioxide and sesquioxide - like regions . in this context especially a comparison of v@xmath7o@xmath8 and v@xmath21o@xmath22",
    "is useful because the materials are structurally very similar . nevertheless , the former compound is the only member of the magnli series which does not undergo an mit as a function of temperature . in a comparison of all magnli phases , vo@xmath0 and v@xmath0o@xmath1",
    "take an exceptional position as they either miss chain end or chain center metal sites . in addition",
    ", they display higher symmetry than that of the triclinic space group @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "this is likewise true for monoclinic v@xmath1o@xmath5 .",
    "the latter compound , although even closer related to the sesquioxide than v@xmath13o@xmath7 , is therefore not suitable for a detailed understanding of the electronic states in v@xmath0o@xmath1 . both v@xmath5o@xmath155 and v@xmath21o@xmath22",
    "are characterized by a superstructure doubling the unit cell at the mit .",
    "while the metal chains of low temperature v@xmath5o@xmath155 @xcite lose their inversion symmetry , there are four inequivalent chains for v@xmath21o@xmath22 .",
    "the notation of the vanadium sites in v@xmath7o@xmath8/v@xmath21o@xmath22 is given in figure [ pic35 ] .",

    "the study of v@xmath7o@xmath8/v@xmath21o@xmath22 is again based on lda calculations , which were performed analogous with the previously discussed magnli phases .",
    "the partial dos shows three groups of bands corresponding to o @xmath11 , v @xmath9 @xmath59 , and v @xmath9 @xmath58 states . due to a reduced formal electron count of @xmath156 and @xmath157 electrons per metal site for the @xmath158 and @xmath159 compound , respectively , the filling of the @xmath59 group is slightly smaller than for v@xmath13o@xmath7 and v@xmath17o@xmath18 .",

    "in particular , the shape of the dos curves is completely understood in terms of the vanadium coordination , which is true for all magnli compounds .",

    "the local @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 densities of states resemble one another even with regard to the details of their shapes , which applies not only to the     @xmath59 densities of states ( dos ) per vanadium atom for high temperature v@xmath7o@xmath8 and v@xmath21o@xmath22 .",
    "the orbitals refer to the local rotated reference frame .",
    "sites v3 and v7 reveal little discrepancy.,width=377 ]    sites v3 and v7 but also to all other metal atoms . due to strong @xmath54-type metal - metal bonding along @xmath81",
    "the chain center atoms are characterized by a distinct splitting of the @xmath87 dos . in the case of v7",
    "we hence find sharp peaks at about @xmath149ev and @xmath161ev . because of the increasing v - v distances at the chain ends the bonding - antibonding splitting is noticeably smaller for the v3 @xmath87 dos , where peaks occur at about @xmath109ev and @xmath98ev . as a consequence of less efficient @xmath55-type v - v overlap via the @xmath89",
    "orbitals the respective dos is rather compact .",
    "in contrast , a substantial splitting in bonding and antibonding branches can be found in the @xmath88 dos . for sites v3 and v7 this shape traces back to metal - metal interaction along @xmath96 .",
    "the strength of the splitting is roughly identical for both sites . to conclude ,",
    "the site - projected densities of states of high temperature v@xmath7o@xmath8/v@xmath21o@xmath22 are well understood from the discussions in the preceding sections . by virtue of very closely related metal - metal bond lengths in the compounds",
    "similar dos curves arise .",
    "thus it is     @xmath59 densities of states ( dos ) per metal atom for sites v3 and v@xmath162 of low temperature v@xmath21o@xmath22 . at high temperatures these sites are equivalent .",
    "the orbitals refer to the local rotated reference frame.,width=377 ]    surprising that only one of the materials undergoes an mit .",
    "while the charges in the 1 - 3 - 5 - 7 chain of v@xmath7o@xmath8 and the 2 - 4 - 6 - 8 chain of v@xmath21o@xmath22 are more or less equally distributed among the metal sites , the other chains show a small shift of charge towards the chain centers , but generally such charge transfer effects are very small . in the calculation the metallic phases of v@xmath7o@xmath8 and v@xmath21o@xmath22 are barely distinguishable as far as the local electronic behaviour is concerned .",
    "the investigation of the low temperature v@xmath21o@xmath22 modification reveals the same mechanisms found previously in the magnli series . depending on the bond lengths to the adjacent vanadium sites along @xmath81 one",
    "finds either increased splitting or enhanced localization of the @xmath87 orbitals .",
    "the v - v bond lengths indicate strong v - v dimerization in the @xmath163-@xmath164-@xmath165-@xmath166 , 2 - 4 - 6 - 8 , and @xmath167-@xmath168-@xmath169-@xmath170 chain , but not in the 1 - 3 - 5 - 7 chain . while the innermost v - v distances of both the 2 - 4 - 6 - 8 and @xmath167-@xmath168-@xmath169-@xmath170 chain elongate at the mit from @xmath171  to @xmath172  and @xmath173 , they shorten for the other chains from @xmath174  to @xmath175  and @xmath176 . thus the dimerization patterns are inversed . as a consequence , in the low temperature structure all vanadium sites , except for v1 , v3 , v5 , and v@xmath163 ,",
    "are involved in strong v - v overlap along @xmath81 .",
    "the increased interaction leads to a stronger bonding - antibonding splitting of the @xmath87 dos . for atoms affected by v - v dimerization",
    "one additionally obtains energetical upshifts of the @xmath88 and @xmath89 densities of states . in accordance with earlier findings",
    "they show typical changes in the electronic structure known from the mit of vo@xmath0 .",
    "although the energetical separation between the @xmath87 states and the remaining @xmath93 states of v@xmath21o@xmath22 grows in the low temperature phase it is still far from complete .",
    "the described peierls - like behaviour does not account for sites v1 , v3 , v5 , and v@xmath163 , which are characterized by decreasing v - v overlap below the mit . due to the reduced metal - metal bonding",
    "the @xmath87 densities of states sharpen and develop a pronounced peak close to the fermi level . because of their sesquioxide - like coordination the behaviour is not surprising for sites v1 and v@xmath163 .",
    "however , the separation from neighbouring vanadium atoms forces v3 and v5 to display the same localization of the @xmath87 orbitals .",
    "hence electronic correlations may be as important for these states as for the v@xmath0o@xmath1-type chain end sites . the question",
    "why one of the four vanadium chains in the low temperature v@xmath21o@xmath22 superstructure prefers localization to dimerization is difficult to answer .",
    "the calculated v @xmath9 valence charges do not give rise to any systematics .",
    "partial @xmath59 densities of states are depicted in figure [ pic34 ] . for the dioxide - like v@xmath164 site",
    "we recognize both an increased splitting of the @xmath87 dos and an energetical upshift of the @xmath88 and @xmath89 curves .",
    "in contrast , the structurally separated v3 site is characterized by a very compact @xmath87 dos located almost completely above the fermi level . in comparison to the sesquioxide - like v1 site of v@xmath13o@xmath7 , see figure [ pic17 ] , the filling of the low temperature @xmath87 states is significantly smaller due to the reduced electron count",
    ". summarizing , these findings support our mit scenario as a mixture of features typical of either vanadium dioxide or sesquioxide , which we developed in the previous sections .",
    "we are nevertheless left with the question why the compound v@xmath7o@xmath8 does not undergo an mit . from purely structural considerations",
    "the main difference between v@xmath7o@xmath8 and v@xmath21o@xmath22 is the amount of dioxide - like center sites .",
    "the local environments and thus the electronic properties of the individual sites are very similar .",
    "however , we point out that the mits in the magnli series arise as combinations of an embedded peierls instabilty inherent in the metal chains and electronic correlations relevant for the chain end atoms .",
    "since compounds with small vanadium chains are dominated by chain end sites and thus more susceptible to correlations , their mits are most likely driven by sesquioxide - like states .",
    "on the other hand , the peierls mechanism should be dominating for materials with long chains .",
    "this scenario of different driving forces of the mits is consistent with the behaviour of the transition temperatures in the magnli series as seen in figure [ pic36 ] . with only one exception ( @xmath177 )",
    "the temperatures decrease monotonously from v@xmath1o@xmath5 to v@xmath7o@xmath8 , which does not show a transition . in the case of v@xmath5o@xmath155",
    "the peculiar superstructure evolving below the mit might cause the observed deviation . transferred to our picture",
    "this kind of systematics corresponds to the decreasing influence of chain end sites as compared to the growing impact of the chain centers .",
    "when the chain length increases the influence of the local electronic correlations at the chain ends diminishes . at the same time",
    "the peierls - like mechanism becomes stronger . with an increasing number of chain center atoms available for v - v dimerization the energy gain resulting from such a modification becomes more and more advantageous . with the experimental transition temperatures in mind we thus attribute the mit of v@xmath21o@xmath22 to a peierls - like scheme ; for v@xmath7o@xmath8 neither of the two mechanisms is strong enough to induce a transition .",
    "the vanadium magnli phases v@xmath2o@xmath3 form a homologous series of compounds with crystal structures comprising dioxide and sesquioxide - like regions .",
    "studying the mits in this material class thus paves the way for a more complete understanding of the phase transitions of the prototypical oxides vo@xmath0 ( @xmath178 ) and v@xmath0o@xmath1 ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "analyzing those v @xmath9 @xmath59 states which are involved in the phase transitions allows us to discuss the changing influence of electronic correlations and electron - lattice interaction on going from vo@xmath0 to v@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "we have developed a unifying description of the various crystal structures including both the rutile structure of vo@xmath0 and the corundum structure of v@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "our systematic representation is based on a regular three - dimensional network of oxygen octahedra partially filled by metal atoms , giving rise to characteristic metal chains of length @xmath179 . due to the comprehensive picture of the structures",
    ", the electronic bands can be grouped into states behaving either vo@xmath0 or v@xmath0o@xmath1-like . the detailed electronic structure and consequently the mits of the magnli phases turn out to be strongly influenced by the local metal - metal coordination .",
    "the phase transitions arise as results of both electron lattice interaction within the dioxide - like and electronic correlations within the sesquioxide - like regions of the crystal .",
    "dioxide - like vanadium sites reveal the characteristic features of the embedded peierls instability responsible for the mit of vo@xmath0 .",
    "the combination of dimerization and antiferroelectric - like displacements of the metal atoms by means of strong electron - lattice interaction causes splitting of the @xmath92 states and energetical upshift of the @xmath88/@xmath89 states .",
    "sites related to v@xmath0o@xmath1 are characterized by strongly reduced v - v overlap .",
    "thus the @xmath87 states become more localized . consequently",
    ", correlation effects play a more important role for these states . in conclusion ,",
    "the electronic structures and the metal - insulator transitions of the magnli phases remain a crucial test case for theories aiming at a correct description of both vo@xmath0 and v@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
