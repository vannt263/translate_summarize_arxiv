    "to search for the theoretical foundation of the current accelerating universe @xcite has become one of the most fundamental problems in modern cosmology . an unknown source of energy which is repulsive in nature referred to as the dark energy is one of the most promising candidates and various proposals for its origin have been put forward @xcite .",
    "but so far , relatively little attention has been paid to the possibility of fermionic sources in cosmology even though it has been known for some time that spinor fields could play some important roles in the evolution of the universe @xcite . for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that a spinor field can accommodate any desired behavior of its energy density if an appropriate self - interaction of the spinor field is introduced and it is suggested that it can account for the dark energy and allows for realistic cyclic non - singular solutions . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is investigated whether fermionic sources could be responsible for the accelerating periods during the evolution of a universe after a matter field would guide for the decelerating period . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors have shown that it is possible to simulate perfect fluid and dark energy by means of a nonlinear spinor field .",
    "recently , the so - called elko spinor , which is a new spin - half field defined as the eigenspinor of the charge conjugation operator with mass dimension one , was introduced in ref .",
    "they have many special properties , one being that their dominant coupling is via the gravitational field and therefore are naturally dark .",
    "it has been proposed to be a candidate of dark matter @xcite and dark energy @xcite and many cosmological aspects of the elko spinor model have been investigated @xcite . in addition ,",
    "dark spinor was shown to be a potential candidate to probe non - trivial topologies in spacetime @xcite and to be incorporated in a natural extension of the standard model by representing a mass dimension - transmuting operator between dirac and elko spinor @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , it was pointed out that the construction of elko spinors itself implicitly violates lorentz invariance .",
    "the authors have proposed a non - local but lorentz invariant version of the dark spinors .",
    "also it is pointed out that some crucial errors of neglecting the spin connection part of the fermionic sector in the computations of stress energy tensors were made in the previous literatures on elko models . the correct expression for the elko spinor field",
    "was applied to dark energy and the result showed the existence of the de sitter acceleration of the universe .",
    "another interesting consequences of dark spinor in cosmological aspects is that the equation of the state @xmath0 for the dark spinor can be negative and can cross the phantom - divide even without any phantom - like matter carrying negative kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "it converges to a parameter value within the bound produced by using wmap data @xcite as was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in spite of these nice features , further dynamical analysis of the elko model following this work using the correct form of the stress energy momentum tensor revealed that scaling attractor solutions do not exist in this model @xcite , and it has the difficulty of addressing the coincidence problem .",
    "this aspect of the dark spinor model draws our attention and motivates to extend to the case in which torsion @xcite is included in the theory .",
    "first , recall that when the cosmological principle is extended to the general relativity theory with torsion , only the time component of the trace and totally anti - symmetric components of the torsion tensor can be nonzero @xcite .",
    "for ordinary dirac spinor , it is well - known that it interacts only with the totally anti - symmetric components of the torsion tensor and the spin connection part does not contribute to the total energy density @xcite . on the other hand , the dark spinor interacts with all components of the torsion and we investigate the cosmological consequence of the torsion in the dark spinor model .",
    "in particular , we find the time component of the non - vanishing trace vector could provide a novel feature of explaining the coincidence problem .",
    "that is , with a mild fine - tuning of the parameters , we show that there exist a cosmological solution in which the universe began its acceleration only recently and that the solution is an attractor .    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    ", we give a brief summary of the spinor field in curved background with torsion in order to set the notation . in sec .",
    ", the action of the dark spinor is given and the equations of motions are calculated .",
    "in sec . , we discuss various cosmological solutions focusing on the solution which can address the coincidence problem and stability analysis of this solution is performed . sec . contains conclusion and discussions .",
    "in this section , we give a brief summary of the spinor field in curved background which is essential for our analysis .",

    "a couple of comments are in order : first , @xmath65 need not be the minimum of the potential ( [ pott ] ) for its stable equilibrium point and can stay away from zero .",
    "this can be seen dynamically from eq .",
    "( [ hscalar ] ) as follows : the restoring force coming from @xmath66 is exactly canceled by the repulsive force coming from the torsion if @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , the scalar field undergoes a damped motion without any force acting , and this solution corresponds to the solution in which if it takes initial value @xmath67 , it stays there forever .",
    "also , we note the difference with an ordinary quintessence model with mass term and cosmological constant . in this case , the @xmath68 is dynamically preferred , and the acceleration can be driven by the cosmological constant . however , the crucial difference is that there is a priori no relation between the cosmological constant and the mass of the scalar field , whereas in the dark spinor model with torsion , there is a relation given by eq .",
    "( [ massy ] ) .",

    "this term acts as a source of a repulsive force , but their magnitude is smaller then the attractive force of eq .",
    "( [ attt ] ) over all , in the asymptotic region , the perturbation equation becomes + + = 0 .",
    "it can be easily checked that the perturbation decays as ~ , and the solution is an attractor in the asymptotic region .",
    "we have examined the possible cosmological role that the torsion could play in the dark spinor model .",
    "freedom exists in the choice of the torsion , which is consistent with the continuity equation .",
    "this has been exploited for the choice of diverse forms of the torsion , which resulted in the various cosmological consequences . in the pure torsion case without dark spinor",
    ", torsion could play the role of the dark matter .",
    "when the torsion is proportional to @xmath98 , we have an accelerating de sitter universe . in particular",
    ", we found an exact cosmological solution in which the universe began its acceleration only recently and it is an attractor .",
    "this corresponds to a specific form of the torsion with a mild fine - tuning and it can address the coincidence problem .    in this work , the torsion was assumed to be a kind of external matter field whose dynamics is dictated by the continuity equation .",
    "even though this does not confront with any theoretical inconsistency , their choices were restrictive to certain forms and could be regarded as rather ad hoc . in the more fundamental approach like the einstein - cartan - sciama - kibble theory of gravity @xcite where the torsion tensor is regarded as a dynamical variable from the beginning , the equations of motion coming from the variation with respect to the torsion generates a spin - spin interaction equation . in the dirac case ,",
    "this interaction is significant only at extremely high densities and it was shown that such an interaction averts the unphysical big - bang singularity , replacing it with a cusp - like bounce at a finite minimum scale factor @xcite .",
    "this approach could be extended to the elko case @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the most general elko matter fields including the dynamical torsion was constructed , whose cosmology leads to anisotropic universes . to the knowledge of the authors ,",
    "the relation between the two approaches has not been explored , and it seems that at present only the former approach could provide the novel cosmological feature of addressing the coincidence problem for the dark spinor .    one interesting feature of the potential ( [ ppp ] )",
    "is that in contrast with the pure exponential potential in the quintessence model where the parameter @xmath79 is restricted to be within a certain range to produce the attractor solution , the solution with the torsion is an attractor for each value of @xmath99 .",
    "moreover , the term @xmath100 is reminiscent of the albrecht - skordis potential @xcite which appears in the low energy limit of @xmath101 theory .",
    "the presence of the torsion is a key ingredient and possible implications of this aspect deserve further investigations .",
    "we conclude with the following remarks . as shown in eq .",
    "( [ massy ] ) of sec .",
    "iv b , there is a relation between the cosmological constant and the mass of the cosmological particle @xmath65 in our dark spinor model with torsion , which might represent the main component of our present universe and is about @xmath102 , as in the massive vector model @xcite . when the analysis is extended to the case including a conformal coupling of dark spinor fields to gravity",
    ", it will provide with a richer variety of cosmological consequences than the case without torsion @xcite .",

    "<S> we study cosmological consequences of the dark spinor model when torsion is included . only some components of the torsion are allowed to be non - vanishing in homogeneous and isotropic cosmology , but there exist freedoms in the choice of these components which is consistent with the evolution equations . </S>",
    "<S> we exploit this and discuss several cases which can result in interesting cosmological consequences . </S>",
    "<S> especially , we show that there exist exact cosmological solutions in which the universe began its acceleration only recently and this solution is an attractor . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to a specific form of the torsion with a mild fine - tuning which can address the coincidence problem . </S>"
