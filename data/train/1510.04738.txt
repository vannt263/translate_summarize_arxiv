    "a principal goal in sensory neuroscience is to understand how properties of our environment are reflected in neural response patterns .",
    "this can be achieved by constructing encoding models that explicitly link stimuli to responses via an intermediate feature space . in literature ,",
    "several feature spaces have been proposed such as linear  @xcite and non - linear  @xcite feature spaces .",
    "more recently , research has focused on the development of feature spaces that are themselves learnt from a large amount of training data which embodies the statistical invariances in our environment  @xcite . to date , the best predictions of neural responses to naturalistic stimuli have been achieved using deep neural networks  @xcite .",
    "an alternative strategy for extracting relevant features from a complex naturalistic stimulus is to directly annotate stimuli in terms of their semantics .",
    "this approach has been used by huth et al .",
    "@xcite , who hand - labelled individual movie frames according to the entities that make up the wordnet ontology  @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated that these entities can be used to predict neural responses across cortex .",
    "this is close in spirit to the work by mitchell et al .",
    "@xcite , who showed that neural responses to presented nouns could be predicted using a feature space that couples nouns to their associated verbs .    the goal of the present work is to take the sketched approach to the next level by using semantic vector space models of language that represent individual words in terms of continuous vector representations to predict neural responses to naturalistic stimuli  @xcite .",
    "these word embeddings have proven highly successful in the sense that the estimated continuous vector representation can be shown to accurately capture semantic information .",
    "if we are able to use these word embeddings to predict neural responses to naturalistic stimuli then this may provide new insights into the neural representation of semantic information .",
    "moreover , it may offer an elegant way to reconstruct semantic information from patterns of brain activity .    here , we tested this approach by annotating individual images with semantic labels ( i.e. words ) and using the associated word embeddings to predict neural responses as people experienced those stimuli .",
    "we show that neural responses in downstream areas are accurately predicted by the word embeddings , demonstrating for the first time that the semantic space implied by word embeddings provide insights in the neural representation of complex naturalistic stimuli .",
    "in order to examine the suitability of word embeddings for predicting neural responses , we made use of the data set that was originally published in  @xcite .    for each of two male subjects ( s1 and s2 ) , five sessions of data were collected as subjects were presented with natural images . training and test data were collected in the same scan sessions .",
    "the total number of images used for training and testing were 1750 and 120 , respectively .",
    "each training image was repeated two times , and each test image was repeated 13 times . in this study , we analyzed the data from one subject ( s1 ) .",
    "stimuli consisted of grayscale natural images drawn randomly from different photographic collections .",
    "subjects fixated on a central white square .",
    "stimuli were flashed at 200 ms intervals for 1 s followed by 3 s of gray background .",
    "data were acquired using a 4 t inova mr scanner and a quadrature transmit / receive surface coil .",
    "eighteen coronal slices were acquired covering occipital cortex ( slice thickness 2.25 mm , slice gap 0.25 mm , field of view 128@xmath0128 mm@xmath1 ) .",
    "fmri data were acquired using a gradient - echo epi pulse sequence ( matrix size 64@xmath064 , tr 1 s , te 28 ms , flip angle 20@xmath2 , spatial resolution 2@xmath02@xmath02.5 mm@xmath3 ) .",
    "fmri scans were coregistered and used to estimate voxel - specific response timecourses .",
    "after deconvolution of these timecourses from the time series data , an estimate of response amplitude was obtained for each presented unique image in each voxel .",
    "voxels were assigned to visual areas using retinotopic mapping data acquired in separate sessions .",
    "additionally , anatomical and functional volumes were coregistered manually .",
    "_ _ freesurfer _ _ and _ _ mrtools _ _ were used for cortical surface reconstruction and visualization , respectively .      in order to associate word embeddings with naturalistic image stimuli ,",
    "the following procedure was used .",
    "first , each of the total of 1870 images was manually annotated by an annotator who labeled each image with the first word that came to mind when inspecting the contents of those images .",
    "this led to a total of 512 unique labels for the stimuli in the training set and 81 unique labels for the stimuli in the test set ( 73 overlapping labels between the training and test set ) .",
    "next , each word was converted to a continuous vector representation .    to obtain continuous word embeddings we used different models based on the skip - gram word - to - vec ( w2v ) model described in  @xcite which learns word representations by predicting the surrounding word of a given word and the global vectors for word representations ( glove ) model described in  @xcite which learns word representations by factorizing a word co - occurance matrix . for the w2v model",
    ", we used the pretrained 300-dimensional word representations trained on 100 billion work google news dataset provided online . for the glove model",
    ", we used eight pretrained word representations trained on 6 billion word wikipedia 2014 + gigaword 5 ( 50- , 100- , 200- and 300-dimensional ) and 27 billion word twitter ( 25- , 50- , 100- , 200-dimensional ) datasets provided online .",
    "for a stimulus @xmath4 , we use @xmath5 to denote the word embedding associated with the label @xmath6 assigned to that stimulus .    as a control model , to compare low - level feature spaces with high - level feature spaces , we used the gabor wavelet pyramid ( gwp ) model described in  @xcite .",
    "the continuous word embeddings were used to predict neural responses to individual stimuli by using them as input to a linear response model .",
    "a separate response model was trained for each voxel using regularized linear regression .",
    "the used estimation procedure is described in detail in  @xcite . for each voxel @xmath7 , after estimating the regression coefficients @xmath8 , we obtain @xmath9 as the predicted response of that voxel to input stimulus @xmath4 .",
    "voxel response models were estimated using the entire training set and evaluated on the test set .",
    "a five - fold cross - validation on the training set was used for model selection ( regularization parameters and significant voxels ) .",
    "we discarded the voxels whose cross - validated prediction accuracies on the training set were not significantly higher than chance level ( @xmath10 , student s t - test , bonferroni correction ) .    to quantify",
    "how well the used feature space predicts voxel responses , we defined the encoding performance of a model as the pearson correlation coefficient ( @xmath11 ) between the observed and predicted responses on the test set .",
    "we also projected the encoding performance back onto the cortical surface to get an estimate of which regions are sensitive to the semantic information that is embodied by the continuous word vector representations .",
    "we compared the encoding performance of multiple models across the union of the significant voxels for the models being compared since different voxels can be significant for different models .",
    "we set the encoding performance for the nonsignificant voxels that are in the union to zero .",
    "we first compared the mean encoding performance of the 9 different semantic vector space models ( figure 1 ) . recall that the models differed in architecture ( w2v or glove ) , dimensionality ( 25 , 50 , 100 , 200 or 300 dimensions ) , training set ( google news , wikipedia 2014 + gigaword 5 , twitter ) and training set size ( 100b , 6b or 27b words ) . the 300-dimensional w2v model trained on the 100 billion word google news dataset",
    "had the highest mean encoding performance ( 0.2064 ) , whereas the 25-dimensional glove model trained on the 27 billion word twitter dataset had the lowest mean encoding performance ( 0.1655 ) .",
    "the difference in architecture , dimensionality and training set size did not have as much an impact on the mean encoding performance as did the dataset selected for training the model .",
    "for example , the encoding performance of the 300-dimensional w2v model trained on the 100 billion word google news dataset was significantly higher than that of the 50- and 100-dimensional glove models trained on the 27 billion word twitter dataset but not the 6 billion word wikipedia 2014 + gigaword 5 dataset .",

    "the fraction of the significant voxels for the w2v model and the mean encoding performance of the w2v model significantly increased from upstream to downstream areas .",

    "our findings are in line with the previous studies which show that individual concepts are represented in the inferior temporal cortex but expand on them by showing that a continuous , distributed , low - dimensional vector space can be underlying these representations .",
