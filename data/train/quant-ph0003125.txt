    "the theory of certain one - parameter ( q ) deformations of lie algebras , the so called quantum groups has been of great interest in the last decade in several areas of physics . in 1989 biedenharn [ 1 ] and mcfarlane [ 2 ] independently defined the q - analogue coherent state of a deformed q - oscillator , for which nelson et al . [ 3 ] were able to obtain the resolution of unity .",
    "since then the properties of a class of deformations of the harmonic oscillator were considered by several authors ( see f.i . [ 4 ] ) .",
    "deformed quantum oscillators are represented by dynamical variables @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 satisfying the commutation relations , @xmath12=a , $ ] @xmath13=-a^{\\dagger } $ ] and @xmath14=f\\left ( n_{a}\\right ) $ ] , with @xmath15 an arbitrary real function of @xmath11 .",
    "all such variables are constructed in terms of single - mode field operators @xmath16 and @xmath17    in 1993 crnugelj et al . [ 5 ] observed that the multiphoton interaction of a single mode laser field with a two level atom is described by deformed - oscillator creation and annihilation operators which in combination with the pseudo - spin atomic operators @xmath18 and @xmath19 , form the potential @xmath20 used in the jaynes - cummings model ( jcm ) [ 6 ] .    in that period",
    "the j - c model was at center of the attention for the study of laser cooling of ions placed in parabolic traps , with the quantized center - of - mass motion of the ion playing the role of the boson mode , coupled via the laser to the internal degrees of freedom . in the case of cooling the operator @xmath9",
    "is represented by a combination of some power of the annihilation operator @xmath21 times a function of @xmath6 . when some bosons of the oscillator mode are destroyed the ion is excited to the upper level from where it decays radiatively .",
    "cooling was investigated in lamb - dicke [ 7 ] and strong - sideband [ 8 ] limits , that is for ion excursions small compared with the radiation wavelength .",
    "this study led to the discovery of many intriguing effects connected with the nonclassical properties of the field , like as a long - time sensitivity to the statistical properties of the radiation field [ 9 ] .",
    "for example , the mean excitation number of the quantized oscillations of a ion driven by a squeezed field exhibited periodic collapses and revivals [ 10 ] .",
    "the interest for the vibrational motion of trapped ions was also motivated by the connection between the state of motion and the properties of the fluorescence spectra [ 11,12 ] .",
    "this link led some experimentalists to look for new non classical radiation states generated by trapped ions forced into some unusual vibrational states .",
    "in analogy to the preparation of nonclassical states of light in quantum optics several authors examined the preparation of the center - of - mass motion in a quantum state having no classical counterpart .",
    "worthy examples were those of cirac et al .",
    "[ 13 ] who considered the possibility of generating squeezed states of the vibrational motion by irradiating the trapped ion with two standing - wave light fields of different frequencies and locating the center of the trap potential at a common node of both waves . in all these cases",
    "the nonlinear dependence of @xmath9 on @xmath22 and @xmath23 , stemmed from the ion motion in the trap potential .",
    "de matos filho and vogel [ 14 ] observed in 1993 that the center - of - mass state of a trapped ion driven by a two - mode laser field decays toward a dark state coincident with a nonlinear coherent state ( hereinafter called ncs ) of a deformed oscillator .",
    "this result brought new fuel to the study of deformed oscillators describing different classes of states arising in the trapped ion motion under the action of two or three fields detuned by multiples of the vibrational frequency ( see f.i . [ 15 ] for nonlinear cat states ) .",
    "in the wake of this interest attention was paid to theoretical models of deformed oscillators , like those connected with excited coherent states and binomial states [ 16 ] .",
    "all these non - linear oscillators differ for the deformation function @xmath24 connecting the annihilation operator @xmath21 to the deformed one @xmath25 . the ancestor of these realizations were the q - oscillators characterized by a deformation @xmath26 increasing with @xmath6 .",
    "contrarily the trapped ion deformation is a very irregular function of @xmath6 , taking positive and negative values .",
    "what is worse , for some combinations of the lamb - dicke parameter @xmath27 and @xmath6 it can vanish or become infinite . as a consequence it is hard to capitalize on the work done for the q - oscillator for studying the ncs of a trapped ion . in particular , while for the q - case it has been found a measure resolving the unity , the same is not exactly true for the ion case . as a consequence the formalism of the bargmann spaces [ 17 ] , which has been extended from the linear oscillators to the q - ones , can not be applied exactly to the ion case .",
    "in fact , it will be shown in the following that this can be done by considering a class of rational deformations which approximate to any degree of accuracy the ion deformation . in most experimental cases the statistical state of a trapped ion",
    "is limited to a finite number of fock states so that these rational deformations may adequately approximate the ion deformation . only in this",
    " weak  sense it is possible to construct a ion - analogue of a bargmann space , on which the deformed creation and annihilation operators are represented as multiplication by @xmath28 and differentiation with respect to @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "this paper is dedicated to an extension of the theory of the usual coherent states to ncs using as examples the deformation relative to the dark states of trapped ions .",
    "we start with a single - mode excitation field @xmath9 ( sec .",
    "ii ) , by discussing some properties of ncs , and introducing a deformed version @xmath29 of the displacement operator ( sec .",

    "v for associating the density matrix operator @xmath31 to a linear functional @xmath32 mapping the test function @xmath33 into the expectation value @xmath34 , by extending the construction of the antinormal probability distribution function [ 18 ] .",
    "the connection with the p - representation is also briefly examined .",
    "section vi is dedicated to ncs on a circle , for which the wigner functions are presented .",
    "finally , the last section is dedicated to the dark states , arising when a trapped ion is driven by a bichromatic laser field .",
    "an asymptotic expression of the deformation and the relative factorial is obtained and its implication on the convergence of the ncs series is discussed .",
    "it comes out that it converges only for @xmath8 in a circle of radius equal to the inverse of @xmath35 . on the other hand",
    "the weight of each fock state can take values so large to prevent the resolution of unity in terms of normalized ncs .",
    "some approximate expressions of the deformation are discussed together with the possibility of using these ncs for representing the ion statistical state .",
    "we consider an ideal two - level ion of mass m constrained to move in a 3d harmonic potential . taking the principal trap ( x - axis ) axis to coincide with the direction of propagation of the driving field",
    ", one quantum number suffices to label the vibrational states of the trap .",
    "the other two are traced out by summing over the corresponding degrees of freedom .",
    "the ion s internal and external degrees of freedom are coupled together by a light field @xmath36 periodically modulated at the frequency @xmath37 of the ion trap @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a generally complex periodic function of frequency @xmath37 and @xmath40 stays for the hermitian conjugate .",

    "we will dwell on monochromatic @xmath45 and bichromatic driving fields @xmath46 with the parameter @xmath47 taking non - negative integer values , and @xmath48 a complex coefficient depending on the amplitudes of the two waves .",
    "now , introducing the lamb - dicke parameter @xmath49 we put as usual @xmath50 . in the classical limit @xmath51 is large and the absorption or emission of a photon will always cause some change in the vibrational state of the atom . in the non - classical lamb - dicke limit ( ldl ) of small @xmath51 , many photons may need to be absorbed or emitted before the atom changes vibrational state .",

    "[ 19 ] the parameter @xmath51 was equal to @xmath52 .",
