    "at the head of the list of discrete painlev equations described by sakai sits an elliptic difference equation , which has attracted a great deal of attention in recent times .",
    "this equation @xcite has the affine weyl group symmetry of type @xmath0 and a perennial question is whether it is unique as the only elliptic - difference - type discrete painlev equation .",
    "while two other candidate equations are now known @xcite , these are related to sakai s elliptic difference equation . in this paper",
    ", we deduce elliptic - difference equations for the first time , which are not related to sakai s equation by either a miura transformation or by projective reduction .",
    "we do this by considering different ( non - conjugate ) translations on the @xmath0 lattice and describing these translations under the action of jacobian elliptic functions .",
    "a discrete painlev equation is an ordinary difference equation , which is iterated by translation in an affine weyl group , where translation corresponds to vectors in the root- or ( equivalently ) weight - lattice @xcite .",
    "sakai s elliptic difference equation is realized by translation on the @xmath0 lattice .    to describe the construction , we first explain how such translations are characterized .",
    "fix a point in the @xmath0 lattice .",
    "then there are 240 nearest neighbors of this point in the lattice , lying at a distance whose squared length is equal to 2 .",
    "we refer to the 120 vectors between this fixed point and its possible nearest neighbors as nearest - neighbor - connecting vectors ( nvs ) .",
    "similarly , there are 2160 next - nearest neighbors , lying at a distance whose squared length is 4 .",
    "the 1080 vectors between the fixed point and such next - nearest neighbors will be referred to as next - nearest - neighbor - connecting vectors ( nnvs ) . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "elliptic difference equations were constructed as translations expressed in terms of nvs .    in a previous study @xcite",
    ", we considered another elliptic difference equation ( equation ) , which was obtained by reduction from a partial difference equation @xcite .",
    "curiously , its symmetry group turns out to be @xmath1 , a sub - group of @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , its time iteration turns out not to be given by translation on the @xmath0 lattice .",
    "however , its square ( i.e. , composition with itself ) _ is _ a translation .",
    "we have discovered that this translation is expressed in terms of nnvs , which makes it very different to the elliptic difference equations in earlier papers @xcite .",
    "note that independent study by carstea _",
    "@xcite has also led to equations with translations given by nnvs .",
    "generalizing this surprising insight led us to the discovery of a new elliptic painlev equation , which can be regarded as the generic version of equation .",
    "the term generic here refers to the fact that it contains the largest number of parameters possible as an equation with symmetry group @xmath2 .",
    "it has 8 parameters in addition to the independent variable .",
    "moreover , we also obtain a projective reduction of sakai s elliptic difference equation , which contains 4 parameters in addition to the independent variable .",
    "all of these elliptic difference equations have the same space of initial values , regularized by blowing up 8 points in arbitrary position in @xmath3 .",
    "the space of initial values is labelled as @xmath4 .",
    "we emphasize here that this characterization of the space of initial values is not enough to distinguish the four different elliptic difference equations described above .",
    "we provide evidence that different ( non - conjugate ) translations in @xmath5 lead to distinct elliptic difference equations .",
    "all four elliptic difference equations are described in this paper in terms of jacobian elliptic functions for the sake of uniformity , because this is the form originally given for equation .",
    "discrete painlev equations are nonlinear ordinary difference equations of second order , which include discrete analogues of the six painlev equations : p@xmath6 , @xmath7 , p@xmath8 . together with the painlev equations , the discrete painlev equations are now regarded as one of the most important classes of equations in the theory of integrable systems ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    sakai s geometric description of discrete painlev equations , based on types of space of initial values , is well known@xcite .",
    "this picture relies on compactifying and regularizing space of initial values .",
    "the spaces of initial values are constructed by the blow up of @xmath3 at eight base points ( i.e. points where the system is ill defined because it approaches @xmath9 ) and are classified into 22 types according to the configuration of the base points as follows :     elliptic&@xmath4    ' '' ''     + multiplicative&@xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ,  , @xmath14 , @xmath15    ' '' ''",

    "the symmetry group of each equation , formed by cremona isometries , arises from the orthogonal complement of this root system inside the picard group .",
    "its birational actions give the discrete painlev equation of interest in each case .",
    "recently , the following elliptic painlev equation was obtained from the reduction of adler s partial difference equation ( or , q4 equation)@xcite :    [ eqns : rcgeqn ] @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the modulus of the elliptic sine ,    @xmath25    and @xmath26 see appendix [ section : appendix_a ] for standard results about jacobian elliptic functions .    in @xcite , the geometry of equation , i.e.",
    ", its space of initial values and corresponding cremona isometries , was investigated .",
    "the space of initial values of equation was identified with the elliptic @xmath4-surface and its cremona isometries collectively form an affine weyl transformation group of type @xmath0 , denoted by @xmath27 . moreover , it was shown that equation can not be derived from a translation of @xmath27 but can be derived by using a projective reduction .",
    "the process of deriving discrete dynamical systems of painlev type from elements of affine weyl groups that are of infinite order ( but that are not necessarily translations ) by taking a projection on an appropriate subspace of parameters is called a projective reduction @xcite .",
    "note that this process is motivated by taking symmetric versions of systems of discrete painlev equations , which has been known since @xcite .",
    "although the geometry of equation has been clarified , the realization of equation from the action of cremona isometries was missing since its base points are parametrized by the jacobian elliptic function ( jacobi s setting ) and birational actions of cremona isometries on such setting were not explicitly known .",
    "the present study fills this gap ( see theorem [ theorem : birational_twe8 ] ) , that is , we provide the realization of the equation as a half - translation of the extended affine weyl group @xmath5 .    in the remainder of the paper",
    ", we refer to sakai s elliptic painlev equation @xcite as the msy elliptic painlev equation @xcite because the former was obtained in @xmath28 while the latter was provided by resolution in @xmath3 .",
    "we work throughout the paper in @xmath3 .",

    "equation and three other elliptic painlev equations are then deduced from the action of this resulting group @xmath5 .",
    "finally , we give some concluding remarks in  [ concludingremarks ] .",
    "in this section , we construct cremona isometries for a generalization of the base points of equation and show that these isometries collectively form an affine weyl group of type @xmath29 .",
    "recall that equation has the following eight base points ( see @xcite ) :    [ eqn : basepoints_rcg ] @xmath30    where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are complete elliptic integrals and @xmath33 which lie on the elliptic curve @xmath34 note that these base points contain three arbitrary parameters @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
