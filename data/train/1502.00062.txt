    "fever ( df ) is a mosquito - borne infectious disease caused by the viruses of the genus _ togaviridae _ ,",
    "subgenus _ flavirus_.",
    "the transmission of this disease is through the bites of vectors ( aedes aegypti , aedes albopictus ) carrying the viruses belonging to _ flavi genus _  @xcite . from its first appearance in the philippines in @xmath0 ,",
    "the disease has been identified as one of the most important arthropod - borne viral disease in humans  @xcite .",
    "dengue virus infection has been reported in more than @xmath1 countries , with @xmath2 billion people living in areas where dengue is endemic .",
    "the annual occurrence is estimated to be around @xmath1 million cases of df and @xmath3 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever ( dhf ) .",
    "the diagnosis of dengue fever presents great challenges as the symptoms overlap with other febrile illnesses .",
    "accurate diagnosis is possible only after conducting definitive tests such as enzyme - linked immunosorbent assays ( elisa ) and real - time polymerase - chain reaction ( rt - pcr ) which are based on nucleic and acid hybridization  @xcite .",
    "a recent study  @xcite on the behavior of c - type lectin domain family @xmath4 , member a ( clec5a ) gene may result in a strategy for reducing tissue damage which would help improve the odds of survival of the patients suffering from dhf and dengue shock syndrome ( dss ) .",
    "a multivariate model was developed in  @xcite for predicting hemoglobin ( hb ) using predictors such as reactance obtained from a single frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis , sex , nausea / vomiting sensation and weight .",
    "these strategies can be employed only after @xmath5 days from the onset of the illness and require state - of - the - art laboratory facilities .    the world health organization ( who ) has arrived at a classification scheme for identifying the infected individuals based on clinical symptoms and laboratory features .",
    "the development of predictive models for diagnosis of dengue fever based on these schemes is affected by missing or incomplete data records in the clinical databases  @xcite which may arise due to any or all of the following reasons ( i ) value being lost ( erased or deleted ) ( ii ) not recorded ( iii ) incorrect measurements ( iv ) equipment errors and ( v ) an expert not attaching any importance to a particular clinical procedure .",
    "usually data is not collected from an organized research point of view  @xcite .",
    "the presence of large number of clinical symptoms and laboratory features requires one to search large sub spaces for optimal feature subsets .",
    "these issues unless addressed appropriately would hinder the development of accurate and computationally effective diagnostic system .    in view of the above challenges , we present the following novel features of our work :    * to identify the missing values ( mv ) in the data set and impute them by using a newly developed novel imputation procedure ; * to identify a set of clinical symptoms that would enable early detection of suspected dengue in children and adults , which reduces the risk of transmission of the dengue fever in the community ; * to identify the laboratory features and clinical symptoms that would enable better diagnosis and understanding of the disease in suspected dengue individuals .",
    "this renders optimal utilization of the laboratory resources required for confirmed diagnosis ; * to build a predictive model that has a capability of rendering effective diagnosis in realtime .",
    "further we compare its performance with other state - of - the - art methods used in the diagnosis of dengue fever .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : a survey of the state - of - the - art techniques for the diagnosis of dengue fever is presented in section  [ review ] , while in section  [ chap8:sec1 ] we describe our novel methodology for computer - aided clinical diagnosis of dengue .",
    "the performance evaluation of the methodologies is described in section  [ evalmethods ] .",
    "the description of the data sets and the experimental results are presented in section  [ chap8:sec3 ] .",
    "we present a comparison of our new imputation methodology with other imputation methods in section  [ permv ] . in section [ chap8:sec4 ]",
    "we discuss the computational complexity of our new method .",
    "comparison of our new methodology with other state - of - the - art methods forms the subject of section [ chap8:sec5 ] .",
    "conclusions and discussion are deferred to section  [ chap8:sec6 ] .",
    "logistic regression method was employed to identify clinical symptoms and laboratory features in @xmath6 individuals , out of which @xmath7 were confirmed dengue  @xcite .",
    "the data records with missing values ( mv ) are ignored and are deleted from the data set . in  @xcite , the study was conducted on clinical records comprising of @xmath8 children and @xmath9 adults out of which @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively were laboratory - confirmed positive dengue cases . in this study",
    "the data fields that are incomplete or inaccurate for all suspected dengue cases were replaced with the known values corresponding to the information in the medical charts .",
    "a c4.5 decision tree which has an in built mechanism of handling mv was employed in  @xcite to develop a diagnostic algorithm to differentiate dengue from non - dengue illness on a data set comprising of @xmath12 patients of which @xmath13 had df , @xmath14 had dhf and @xmath15 had dss . a support vector machine ( svm ) based methodology was employed in  @xcite to analyze the expression pattern of @xmath16 genes of @xmath17 dengue patients of which",
    "@xmath18 were dhf and @xmath19 were df cases .",
    "a set of seven influential genes were identified through selective removal of expression data of these twelve genes .    in the above studies the mv were either removed  @xcite , or filled with approximate values based on medical charts  @xcite .",
    "these approaches would lead to biased estimates and may either reduce or exaggerate the statistical power .",
    "methods such as logistic regression , maximum likelihood and expectation maximization have been employed for imputation of mv , but they can be applied only on data sets that are either nominal or numeric .",
    "there are other imputation methods such as k - nearest neighbor imputation ( knni )  @xcite ; k - means clustering imputation ( kmi )  @xcite ; weighted k - nearest neighbor imputation ( wknni )  @xcite and fuzzy k - means clustering imputation ( fkmi )  @xcite that have been applied on other data sets but not on dengue fever data sets .",
    "however , the authors in  @xcite have employed methods such as odds ratio ( or ) and selective inclusion or exclusion of attributes for obtaining features sub sets of data sets of dengue fever .",
    "but these methods do not yeild effective diagnosis as all interactions or correlations between the features and the diagnosis are not considered in these studies .",
    "motivated by the above issues we propose a new methodology comprising of a novel non parametric missing value imputation method that can be applied on data sets consisting of attributes that are of the type categorical ( nominal ) and/or numeric ( integer or real ) .",
    "the methodology proposed in  @xcite ignores missing values while generating the decision tree , which renders lower prediction accuracies .",
    "we have embedded the new imputation strategy ( section  [ chap9:rni ] ) before generating the alternating decision tree which results in the improved performance of the classifier on data sets having missing values . also , we develop an effective wrapper based features selection algorithm in order to identify the most influential features subset .",
    "the present methodology comprises in utilizing the new imputation embedded alternating decision tree and the wrapper based features subset selection algorithm .",
    "this methodology can predict the diagnosis of dengue in real time .",
    "in fact the machine knowledge acquired by utilizing this novel methodology will be useful to diagnose other individuals based on clinical symptoms and laboratory features where the clinical decision is unavailable .",
    "we designate this novel methodology as nm throughout this work .",
    "a clinical data set can be represented as a set _ s _ having row vectors @xmath20 and column vectors @xmath21 .",
    "each record can be represented as an ordered n - tuple of clinical and laboratory attributes @xmath22 for each @xmath23 where the last attribute @xmath24 for each _ i _ , represents the physician s diagnosis to which the record @xmath25 belongs and without loss of generality we assume that there are no missing elements in this set .",
    "each attribute of an element in _",
    "s _ that is @xmath26 for @xmath23 and @xmath27 can either be a categorical ( nominal ) or numeric ( real or integer ) type .",
    "clearly all the sets considered are finite sets .",
    "the first step in any imputation algorithm is to compute the proximity measure in the feature space between the clinical records to identify the nearest neighbors from where the values can be imputed .",
    "the most popular metric for quantifying the similarity between any two records is the euclidean distance .",
    "even though this metric is simpler to compute , it is sensitive to the scales of the features involved .",
    "further it does not account for correlation between the features .",
    "also , the categorical variables can only be quantified by counting measures which calls for the development of effective strategies for computing the similarity  @xcite .",
    "considering these factors we first propose a new indexing measure @xmath28 between two typical elements @xmath29 , @xmath30 for @xmath31 @xmath32 belonging to the column @xmath33 of _ s _ which can be applied on any type of data , be it categorical ( nominal ) and/or numeric ( real or integer ) .",
    "we consider the following cases :    case i : : :    @xmath34 +    let _ a _ denote the collection of all members of _ s _ that belong to the    same decision class to which @xmath29 and    @xmath30 belong and does not have mv .",
    "based on the type of    the attribute to which the column @xmath33 belongs , the    following situations arise : +    +    * elements of the column @xmath33 of @xmath35 are of    categorical ( nominal ) type : +    we now express _ a _ as a disjoint union of non - empty subsets of _ a _ ,    say    @xmath36    obtained in such a manner that every element of _ a _ belongs to one of    these subsets and no element of _ a _ is a member of more than one    subset of _ a_. that is    @xmath37 ,    in which    @xmath38    denote the cardinalities of the respective subsets    @xmath36    formed out of the set _ a _ , with the property that each member of the    same subset has the same first co - ordinate and members of no two    different subsets have the same first co - ordinate .",
    "we define an index    @xmath39    +    where @xmath40 represents the cardinality of the    subset @xmath41 , all of whose elements have    first co - ordinates @xmath42 and    @xmath43 represents the cardinality of that subset    @xmath44 , all of whose elements have first    co - ordinates @xmath45 .",
    "+    * elements of the column @xmath33 of s are of numeric    type : +    numeric types can be classified further as integers ( whole numbers ) or    real ( fractional numbers ) .",
    "if the attribute is of integer type then we    follow the procedure discussed in case i item ( i ) . for fractional    numbers we construct the index @xmath28 ,    based on the ratio of the values of the elements    @xmath46 of @xmath47 column to the mean    of the set of elements belonging to _ a _ that do not have mv and",
    "is    given by @xmath48 in the above    definition @xmath49 denotes the average of the    @xmath47 column entries of all the elements of the set _ a _    excluding those with mv in the @xmath47 column .",
    "case ii : : :    @xmath50 +    clearly @xmath29 and @xmath30 belong to two    different decision classes .",
    "consider the subsets @xmath51    and @xmath52 consisting of members of _ s _ that share the    same decision with @xmath29 and @xmath30    respectively and does not have mv .",
    "clearly    @xmath53 . based on the type of the    attribute",
    "to which the column @xmath33 belongs , the    following situations arise : +    +    * elements of the column @xmath33 of s are of nominal or    categorical type : +    following the procedure discussed in case i item ( i ) we write _ p _ and    _ q _ as a disjoint union of non - empty subsets of    @xmath54 and    @xmath55    respectively in which    @xmath56 and    @xmath57 indicate the    cardinalities of the respective subsets .",
    "we define the indexing    measure between the two records @xmath29 and    @xmath30 as @xmath58 where    @xmath59 represents the cardinality of the subset    @xmath60 all of whose elements have first    co - ordinates @xmath42 in set @xmath61 and    @xmath62 represents the cardinality of that subset    @xmath63 , all of whose elements have first    co - ordinates @xmath45 in set @xmath64 .",
    "+    * elements of the column @xmath33 of s are of numeric    type : +    if the type of the attribute is integer we follow the procedure    discussed in case ii item ( i ) . for fractional numbers we define the    index @xmath28 between the two records    @xmath65 as @xmath66 in the above    definition @xmath67 where    @xmath68 and @xmath69 denote the average of    the first column entries of all the elements of the sets    @xmath70 and @xmath71 excluding those    with mv in the @xmath47 column .    the proximity or distance scores between the clinical records in the data set @xmath35 can be represented as @xmath72 where @xmath73 . for each of the missing value instances in a record @xmath29",
    "our imputation procedure first computes the score @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 denotes the mean distance .",
    "we then pick up only those records ( nearest neighbors ) which satisfy the condition @xmath77 where @xmath78 denote the distances of the current record @xmath29 to all other records in the data set @xmath35 .",
    "if the type of attribute is categorical or integer , then the data value that has the highest frequency ( mode ) of occurrence in the corresponding columns of the nearest records is imputed . for the data values of type real we impute the mean of data values in the corresponding columns of the nearest records .",
    "* illustrative example : * the following example illustrates the spirit of the new imputation algorithm . consider a data set represented by the matrix @xmath35 consisting of rows @xmath79= ( ? , 12.0 , positive ) , @xmath80= ( yes , 10.5 , positive ) , @xmath81= ( no , 14.0 , positive ) and @xmath82=(no , 13.0 , negative ) . the missing value instance ( ? ) in this data set is present in record @xmath79 and column @xmath83 .",
    "these rows correspond to the data records of four individuals .",
    "clearly the case i item ( i ) of the imputation algorithm applies to this data set for determining the missing value .",
    "the matrix of the indexing measure @xmath84 has the following rows : ( 0,0.86 ) and ( 0,0.99 ) in which @xmath85 @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the relative distances between @xmath79 and the other records are computed as @xmath88 and the corresponding z - scores are obtained as @xmath89 . since z @xmath90 0 for the distances between @xmath79 and @xmath80 and also @xmath79 and @xmath81 , we conclude that the records @xmath80 and @xmath81 are nearer to @xmath79 and hence the highest frequency ( mode ) of the data value in column @xmath83 is yes. accordingly this value is a suitable candidate for imputation .      in situations presented by",
    "real world processes , influential features are often unknown _ a priori _ , hence features that are redundant or those that are weakly participating in decision making must be identified and appropriately handled . the features selection procedures can be categorized as random or sequential .",
    "the sequential methods such as forward selection , backward elimination and bidirectional selection employ greedy methods and hence may not often be successful in finding the optimal features subsets .",
    "in contrast to this stochastic optimization methods such as genetic algorithms ( gas ) perform global search and are capable of effectively exploring large search spaces  @xcite . in our approach",
    "we adopt a wrapper subset based feature evaluation model  @xcite where the method of classification itself is used to measure the importance of the features sub set identified by the ga .",
    "an alternating decision tree ( adt ) consists of decision nodes ( splitter node ) and prediction nodes which can either be an interior node or a leaf node .",
    "the tree generates a prediction node at the root and then alternates between decision nodes and further prediction nodes .",
    "decision nodes specify a predicate condition and prediction nodes contain a single number denoting the predictive value .",
    "an instance can be classified by following all paths for which all decision nodes are true and summing the relevant prediction nodes that are traversed .",
    "a positive sum implies membership of one class and the negative sum indicates the membership of the opposite class .",
    "the standard definitions of the performance measures such as the specificity ( sp ) , sensitivity ( se ) , receiver operator characteristics ( roc ) and area under roc ( auc ) based on number of true positives , true negatives , false positives and false negatives are utilized in our experimental analysis .",
    "we employed a stratified @xmath91-fold cross validation for estimating the test error on classification algorithms .",
    "we have randomly divided the given data set into @xmath91 disjoint subsets .",
    "each subset is roughly of equal size and has the same class proportions as in the original data set .",
    "the classification model has been built by setting aside one of the subsets as test data set and train the classifier using the other nine subsets .",
    "the trained model is then employed in classifying the test data set .",
    "the experiment is repeated by setting aside each of the @xmath91 subsets as test data sets one at a time . to compute roc for @xmath91 folds we first train a classifier using the training data set of a @xmath91 fold and",
    "then obtain the scores in terms of the predicted probabilities for positives and negatives from the trained classifier using the test data set corresponding to the same fold as the training data .",
    "once all the probabilities and corresponding actual decisions are collected , the roc is obtained by first computing the thresholds using the quartiles of the cumulative predictive probabilities of all the @xmath91 folds . for each threshold value the measures se and sp are computed .",
    "the false positive rate and true positive rate values of the roc is taken as ( 1-sp ) and se respectively .",
    "the auc is computed by applying a trapezoidal rule on the data points of the roc curve .",
    "the optimal cut off or operating point is the threshold that is closest point to ( 0,1 ) on the roc curve which gives the equal error rate .",

    "<S> identification of the influential clinical symptoms and laboratory features that help in the diagnosis of dengue fever in early phase of the illness would aid in designing effective public health management and virological surveillance strategies . keeping this as our main objective we develop in this paper , a new computational intelligence based methodology that predicts the diagnosis in real time , minimizing the number of false positives and false negatives . </S>",
    "<S> our methodology consists of three major components ( i ) a novel missing value imputation procedure that can be applied on any data set consisting of categorical ( nominal ) and/or numeric ( real or integer ) ( ii ) a wrapper based features selection method with genetic search for extracting a subset of most influential symptoms that can diagnose the illness and ( iii ) an alternating decision tree method that employs boosting for generating highly accurate decision rules . </S>",
    "<S> the predictive models developed using our methodology are found to be more accurate than the state - of - the - art methodologies used in the diagnosis of the dengue fever .    </S>",
