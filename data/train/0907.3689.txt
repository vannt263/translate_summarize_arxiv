    "recently , new tools such as the diagrammatic monte carlo method have been developed @xcite , which have a less severe sign problem and have , e.g. , been demonstrated to give precise results for the repulsive fermi - hubbard model in the ( correlated ) fermi liquid regime @xcite .    in a complementary development , generalizations of dmrg ideas to higher dimensions",
    "have been put forward . to this purpose , first , one needs to give an ansatz for the many - particle state for which the number of degrees of freedom does only scale polynomial with system size but is ( hopefully ) still appropriate to describe , e.g. , the ground states of the higher - dimensional system .",

    "third , a corresponding algorithm to determine or approximate the ground state within the ansatz class on a classical computer needs to be worked out .",
