    "the resistivity in magnetically ordered materials has been studied experimentally and theoretically during the last 50 years . unlike the resistivity in non magnetic systems which is due mainly to the scattering of conduction electrons by phonons , the resistivity in magnetic materials depends on the magnetic ordering .",
    "it has been theoretically shown that in ferromagnets the resistivity is due to the spin - spin correlation by several workers@xcite , using various approximations such as mean - field theories and boltzmann s equation .",
    "the main difference of these treatments resides on the way the correlation length is taken into account : long - range correlation gives rise to a divergence of the magnetic resistivity @xmath0 at the transition temperature @xmath1 , while short - range correlation causes a rounded peak .",
    "experimental data show that @xmath0 has several forms depending on the materials : @xmath0 shows a peak , a rounded shoulder , or just a change of slope at @xmath1 . in the last case , it is @xmath2 which shows a peak@xcite . in recent experiments performed on different kinds of magnetic pure or doped materials ranging from insulators , semiconductors to superconductors ,",
    "the form of @xmath0 is very different@xcite .",
    "these theories and experiments suggest that the shape of @xmath0 depends on the different magnetic interactions in the system , and on the local magnetic ordering through which the itinerant spins evolve .",
    "recently , the study of spin resistivity has attracted again much attention due to numerous applications since the discovery of the so - called giant magnetoresistance@xcite .",
    "let us recall first some results in the ferromagnetic case . at very low temperatures @xmath3 where spin - wave scattering is dominant",
    ", the resistivity has been studied in detail showing a @xmath4 behavior@xcite . near the transition ,",
    "we have shown in recent papers@xcite that the pronounced peak at the curie temperature @xmath1 of the magnetic resistivity of ferromagnets can be explained by the scattering of itinerant spins by defect clusters formed in the lattice around @xmath1 .",
    "this picture has an advantage : it can be checked easily by calculating the numbers and the sizes of the clusters numerically during the simulation using the hoshen - kopelmann s algorithm@xcite .",
    "note that clusters of down spins can be considered as magnetic impurities embedded in a up - spin sea which have been theoretically studied by zarand et al.@xcite where they found also a pronounced peak of the resistivity .",
    "of course , the cluster sizes reflect the correlation length used in early theories@xcite .",
    "it is not a surprise that our results for ferromagnets were in agreement with all these theories .",
    "the case of antiferromagnets has not been well studied .",
    "there were only a few works which mentioned briefly some behaviors .",
    "let us cite the work by haas where he stated that in antiferromagnets there is no peak in @xmath0 using the spin - spin correlation in the boltzmann s equation@xcite .",
    "our recent works@xcite on the simple cubic and the body - centered cubic ising antiferromagnets show that there is indeed no peak in @xmath0 : @xmath0 varies with @xmath3 in a manner similar to that of the internal energy versus @xmath3 . as a consequence ,",
    "the differential resistivity @xmath5 shows a peak at the transition temperature @xmath1 just like the specific heat .",
    "interestingly enough , this behavior has been experimentally observed in mnsi and related compounds@xcite .",
    "we will show below some results of these non frustrated antiferromagnets for comparison with the frustrated case studied in this paper .",
    "our purpose is to show in this paper one of the remarkable cases : the face - centered cubic ( fcc ) antiferromagnet ( af ) .",
    "this system is known to be fully frustrated with a strong first - order transition in the ising case@xcite .",
    "the spin resistivity is known to be very sensitive to the nature of the ordering of the media through which the itinerant spins move : local disordering ( for instance , disordering near film surfaces , around magnetic impurities ) , magnetic instability , ... the fcc af is thus a very good candidate where exotic behaviors are expected for the spin resistivity .",
    "this will indeed be seen in this work . by using monte carlo ( mc ) simulation ,",
    "we show that frustration and interaction range between itinerant spins and lattice spins play a crucial role on the spectacular discontinuity of the magnetic resistivity at @xmath1 . in the case of heisenberg spin , the transition is also of first order , though weaker , in the bulk@xcite .",
    "we study also this model in this work to outline the effect of spin continuous degrees of freedom on the resistivity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii is devoted to the description of the model and the calculation method . in section iii , we show mc results on the temperature dependence of the magnetic resistivity in the ising spin model .",

    "these degenerate states are not equivalent in the spin transport in the @xmath16 direction as seen below : in the first degenerate state , the itinerant spins move in the @xmath16 direction between an up - spin plane and a down - spin plane , while in the second degenerate state the itinerant spins meet successively an up - spin plane and a down - spin plane perpendicular to their trajectories",
    ". we will present our results for these two cases separately .",
    "the procedure of our simulation can be split into two steps .",
    "the first step consists in equilibrating the lattice at a given temperature @xmath3 without itinerant electrons .",

    "one has @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the charge of electron , @xmath42 the applied electrical field and @xmath43 the displacement vector of an electron .",
    "+ since the interaction between itinerant electron spins is attractive , we need to add a chemical potential in order to avoid a possible collapse of electrons into some points in the crystal and to ensure a homogeneous distribution of electrons during the simulation .",
    "the chemical potential term is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the concentration of itinerant spins in the sphere of @xmath26 radius , centered at @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 is a constant parameter appropriately chosen .",
    "+ the procedure of spin dynamics can be described as follows . after injecting @xmath24 itinerant electrons in the equilibrated antiferromagnetic fcc lattice , we calculate the energy @xmath48 of an itinerant electron taking into account all interactions described above .",

    "that the move is rejected if the electron falls in a sphere of radius @xmath54 centered at a lattice spin or at another itinerant electron . that excluded space emulates the pauli exclusion .",
    "we calculate the new energy @xmath55 and use the metropolis algorithm to accept or reject the electron displacement .",
    "we choose another itinerant electron and begin again this procedure .",
    "when all itinerant electrons are considered , we say that we have made a mc sweeping , or one mc step .",
    "we have to repeat a large number of mc steps to reach a stationary transport regime .",
    "when the stationary regime is reached , we perform the averaging to determine physical properties such as magnetic resistivity , electron velocity , energy etc . as functions of temperature .",
    "we emphasize here that in order to have sufficient statistical averages on microscopic states of both the lattice spins and the itinerant spins , we use the following procedure : after averaging the resistivity over @xmath56 mc steps we thermalize again the lattice with @xmath57 steps , then equilibrate the itinerant spins with @xmath58 steps before taking back the averaging of the resistivity during @xmath56 steps .",

    "a variation of each parameter does not change qualitatively the results shown below . as will be seen , only the variation of @xmath25",
    "does change drastically the results .",
    "that is the reason why we will study in detail the effect of this parameter . for larger densities of itinerant spins ,",
    "the resistivity is larger as expected because of additional scattering process between itinerant spins .    in view of the above requirements , we take for the simulations : @xmath86 ( af interaction ) , @xmath87 , @xmath74 $ ] , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 , @xmath53 being the fcc lattice constant . within these choices ,",

    "the resistivity decreases slowly to the same value for all @xmath25 in paramagnetic phase .",
    "we explain the behavior of @xmath0 at different temperature regions :    * when @xmath98 , the resistivity slightly increases because itinerant spins search to minimize energy by occupying low - energy positions in the periodic lattice . since thermal energy and electric field are not strong enough to make them move , the itinerant spins are somewhat frozen in some almost periodic positions , namely a pseudo crystallization .",

    "[ path ] how the spins travel across the system . as seen , for equal travel time",
    "an itinerant spin moves faster and farther in the first degenerate configuration than in the second one for @xmath102 .",
    "this can be understood because the itinerant ( up ) spin is stopped for a more or less long time in front of a wall of down spins perpendicular to its @xmath16 trajectory in the second degenerate configuration . however , when @xmath25 is very large , for instance 1.4@xmath53 , there is no more difference between the two configurations because the distance is long enough for an itinerant spin to see other spins across down - spin walls .     in the first degenerate state ( upper ) and in the second degenerate state ( lower ) during an equal travel time with @xmath102 .",
    "as seen , spins move more easily in the first degenerate configuration than in the second one .",
    "other parameters are @xmath78 , @xmath73 , @xmath76 , @xmath96,width=453 ]      let us recall that in ferromagnets , @xmath0 shows a peak at @xmath1 .",
    "this peak was interpreted as a consequence of spin - spin correlation .",
    "the form of the peak depends on the correlation range@xcite .",
    "other interpretations which were based on scattering by defect clusters@xcite or by impurities@xcite are all in agreement . in antiferromagnets ,",
    "the situation is quite different . unlike in ferromagnets",
    "where itinerant spins are slowed down only when they encounter antiparallel spins of defect clusters , in antiferromagnets itinerant spins see both parallel and antiparallel spins in any of its position , so their motion depends drastically on their immediate local spin configuration whose energy is determined by the interaction range @xmath25 .",
    "in addition , the behavior of the spin resistivity in antiferromagnets depends on several other ingredients among which one can mention the crystal structure , the nature of the magnetic ordering , and the spin model .",
    "we have simulated some non frustrated antiferromagnets such as ising antiferromagnetic simple cubic ( sc ) and body - centered cubic ( bcc ) lattices .",
    "the spin resistivity shows no peak in these cases@xcite .",
    "in this section , we presently briefly the results on the same lattice with the heisenberg spin model .",
    "itinerant spins are the same as used above , namely polarized ising spins . this assumption allows to outline only the effect of the continuous nature of the heisenberg lattice spin on the resistivity .",
    "the full hamiltonian with different kinds of interaction is assumed as above except the exchange interaction between lattice spins .",
    "this is given by @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the heisenberg spin at the site @xmath30 and @xmath119 an ising - like anisotropy which is assumed to be negative to favor an antiparallel spin ordering on the @xmath18 axis .",
    "when @xmath119 is zero , one has the isotropic heisenberg model . in order to have at phase transition at a nonzero @xmath3",
    ", we should take a nonzero value for @xmath119 because it is known , by the theorem of mermin - wagner@xcite , that for vector spin models there is no long - ranged ordering at finite temperatures in two dimensions .",
    "the small thickness considered here is , in a phase - transition point of view , equivalent to a two dimensional system . except @xmath119 , note that we use the same assumptions as in eq .",
    "( [ hamilr ] ) .",
    "the transition temperature with @xmath120 is @xmath121 for the lattice size @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "we use here the same analysis as for the ising case above : we first look at the effect of @xmath25 on the resistivity at two temperatures , one lower and one higher than @xmath1 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ heis - rd1-dg2 ] where the upper ( lower ) figure is for the first ( second ) degenerate spin configuration . again here , one observes that the two degenerate states do not yield the same transport properties as in the ising case .",
    "the same remarks on physical mechanism are thus applied ( see [ idg1 ] and [ idg1 ] ) .",
    "( in unit of the lattice constant @xmath53)at temperatures @xmath122 ( black circles ) and @xmath123 ( white diamonds ) for first ( upper ) and second ( lower ) degenerate configurations .",

    "depending on the value of @xmath25 , @xmath0 undergoes a sharp increase or decrease at @xmath1 . at some values such as that corresponding to the upper curve of the upper figure",
    ", the resistivity can go across a large region of fluctuations without a sharp jump .",
    "so in experiments , care should be taken to interpret similar behavior if any .",
    "note that the second degenerate configuration yields always a larger resistivity than in the first one , as observed in the ising case in the previous section .",
    "the effect of @xmath119 on the resistivity is not very important in the reasonable range @xmath124 $ ] : except the fact that @xmath1 varies with @xmath119 , for instance @xmath125 for @xmath126 and @xmath127 for @xmath128 , the discontinuity of @xmath0 at @xmath1 diminishes only slightly with decreasing @xmath119 .     and @xmath101 for @xmath78 itinerant spins versus @xmath3 for @xmath102 ( black circles ) and @xmath103 ( white circles ) in unit of the lattice constant @xmath53 for first ( upper ) and second ( lower ) degenerate states .",

    "the model used in this paper is rather general .",
    "it has been applied to ferromagnets with success@xcite .",
    "we believe that it can be applied to different materials by choosing appropriate interactions .",
    "for example , in metals we have to reduce to almost zero the interaction between itinerant spins and lattice spins to create the situation of almost - free conduction electrons .",
    "the lattice disordering transition in magnetic metals then should not strongly affect the spin resistivity . in semiconductors , that interaction should be strong enough to reproduce a peak of @xmath0 as experimentally observed .",
    "we have shown in this paper that the spin resistivity @xmath0 of the fully frustrated fcc antiferromagnet is quite different from that of ferromagnets@xcite and non frustrated antiferromagnets@xcite .",
    "@xmath0 does not show a peak at the magnetic phase transition temperature .",
    "it shows instead a discontinuous jump at the transition temperature @xmath1 .",
    "the jump depends on the numbers of parallel and antiparallel localized spins which interact with an itinerant spin . after transition",
    ", the resistivity tends to a saturation value independent of @xmath25 .",
    "the abrupt behavior of @xmath0 at @xmath1 in the af fcc ising lattice is an effect of the frustration which causes a first - order transition of the lattice magnetic ordering leading to a discontinuity of @xmath0 at @xmath1 .",
    "we are not aware of experiments performed on spin transport in materials with first - order magnetic transition .",
    "our result is thus a prediction which would be useful for future experiments .",
    "note however that for electrical transport , the electrical resistivity shows a discontinuity at a metal - insulator `` first - order '' transition in prni@xmath129@xcite and ndni@xmath129@xcite .",
    "our magnetic resistivity found in this paper has also a discontinuity behavior at a magnetic `` first - order '' transition .",
    "this similarity shows that the resistivity is closely related to the nature of the phase transition , whatever its origin ( magnetic , insulator - metal , ... ) may be .",
    "the mapping between the two cases however is not the scope of this paper .",
    "we have also shown that the surface disordering causes a peak of the resistivity at the surface transition temperature . in the heisenberg model ,",
    "the spin continuous degrees of freedom weaken the first - order transition , yielding in general a reduction of the critical temperature and a less abrupt change of the resistivity at the transition .    as a last remark ,",
    "let us emphasize that the behavior of the spin resistivity at @xmath1 is quite different from one antiferromagnet to another .",
    "it depends on many factors such as the lattice structure , the interaction range , the spin model and the instability ( in particular due to frustration ) of the spin ordering .",
