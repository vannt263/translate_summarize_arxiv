    "the study of effective smooth torus actions on compact , smooth manifolds has a rich and long tradition in the theory of smooth transformation groups ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in riemannian geometry ,",
    "starting with hsiang and kleiner s topological classification of compact riemannian @xmath0-manifolds of positive ( sectional ) curvature with an effective isometric circle action @xcite , isometric actions of tori have been successfully used to obtain classification results on compact riemannian manifolds with positive or nonnegative curvature and large isometry groups ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the present paper s main contribution is the observation that several results on smooth torus actions on compact smooth simply connected manifolds , and on isometric torus actions on compact simply connected riemannian manifolds with positive or nonnegative curvature , hold under less restrictive conditions which do not involve the existence of a group action . indeed",
    ", many of these results do not hold because of the presence of a torus action , but rather because the orbit decomposition of the manifold has the structure of a _ singular riemannian foliation _ whose leaves are diffeomorphic to flat tori of possibly different dimensions . to make this statement precise , we introduce a special class of singular riemannian foliations , _ b - foliations _ , which generalize isometric torus actions on complete riemannian manifolds . roughly speaking",
    ", a b - foliation @xmath2 is a partition of a complete riemannian manifold @xmath3 into connected closed submanifolds , called the _ leaves _ of @xmath4 , all of which are homeomorphic to some flat manifold and are at a constant distance from each other .",
    "more generally , b - foliations are a particular instance of singular riemannian foliations whose leaves are homeomorphic to some closed aspherical manifold",
    ". we will call such singular riemannian foliations _ a - foliations_.    the fact that a - foliations are more general than isometric torus actions is clear for several reasons . on the one hand ,",
    "the leaves need not be tori . on the other hand , even when the leaves of an a - foliation @xmath2 on a complete riemannian manifold @xmath3 are diffeomorphic to standard tori , the foliation may not be homogeneous , i.e.  there might not be a global torus action on @xmath3 inducing the given singular riemannian foliation @xmath4 .",
    "this occurs , for example , when the distribution of the tangent spaces of the torus leaves is not orientable .",
    "moreover , we assume the leaves of an a - foliation to be homeomorphic to aspherical manifolds , but not necessarily diffeomorphic . therefore , our main results hold when the leaves carry exotic smooth structures , e.g.  in the case of exotic tori . nevertheless , we do not know of any non - trivial examples of singular riemannian foliations whose leaves are exotic tori",
    ". it would be interesting to find b - foliations by exotic tori on simply connected manifolds and , in particular , on spheres .    in this paper",
    "we focus our attention on a- and b - foliations on compact simply connected riemannian manifolds . although every aspherical manifold can appear as the regular leaf of an a - foliation , our first result implies that the simply connected case is considerably more rigid .",
