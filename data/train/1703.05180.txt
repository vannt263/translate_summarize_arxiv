    "the 11-type fe - chalcogenides ( fe - ch ) are considered as representative members of the family of fe - based superconductors because their crystal structure comprises only of the basic tetrahedral building blocks of edge - sharing fe(ch)@xmath4 units which are similar to the fe(as)@xmath4 units of the fe - arsenides ( fe - as ) .",
    "the composition of single - phase material of fe@xmath0se with @xmath5 is very close to stoichiometry @xcite .",
    "the superconducting properties of fese were found to be extremely sensitive to the amount of excess fe present in the sample .",
    "the superconducting transition temperature @xmath6 decreases drastically with increasing fe @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the isostructural phase of the heavier homologue tellurium , fe@xmath0te , occurs only in the presence of excess fe ( @xmath7 ) @xcite .",
    "the excess fe is situated in the interstitial @xmath8 crystallographic site within the tellurium planes @xcite .",
    "bulk fe@xmath0te does not show a superconducting transition , but its magnetic and structural properties can be tuned by changing the amount of excess fe in the sample @xcite .",
    "substitution of se for te in fe@xmath0te induces superconductivity with a maximum @xmath9 15 k observed for @xmath10 50 @xmath11 se substitution @xcite .",
    "also for the substituted materials , the superconducting as well as the normal state properties of fe@xmath0te@xmath1se@xmath2 are found to be influenced by excess fe . in the normal state ,",
    "a charge carrier localization in the electrical transport has been observed in fe@xmath0te@xmath12se@xmath12 for higher fe concentrations @xcite .",
    "since the concentrations of excess fe in single phase materials of fe@xmath0te @xcite and fe@xmath0se @xcite are substantially different , a composition gradient of fe can be expected in the substitution series of fe@xmath0te@xmath1se@xmath2 . to our knowledge , a careful investigation of the chemical homogeneity range of fe@xmath0te@xmath1se@xmath2 is still lacking even though the knowledge of the chemical homogeneity range of these materials is of utmost importance for a proper interpretation of more complex phenomena such as the coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity .",
    "therefore , we synthesized a series of polycrystalline fe@xmath0te@xmath1se@xmath2 and investigated the properties by powder x - ray diffraction ( pxrd ) , energy dispersive x - ray spectrosocpy ( edx ) , and magnetization measurements to establish the homogeneity range of the ternary phase .",

    "more than sixty compounds with different compositions in the range @xmath13 and @xmath14 were synthesized by taking appropriate mixtures of nominal amounts of fe , se and te .",
    "starting materials were heated up to 973 k with a rate of 100 k / h and kept at this temperature for 24 hours before increasing the temperature to 1193 k. the dwelling at 1193 k for 24 h was followed by cooling to 973 k with a rate of 100 k / h ( 50 k / h ) , and further annealing for 12 hours .",
    "finally , samples were cooled to room temperature at a rate of 100 k / h . in specific cases ,",
    "the samples were annealed at 973 k for 48 h to enhance the homogeneity . for the nominal compositions with @xmath15 ,",
    "a lower annealing temperature ( 673 k ) was used .",
    "all synthesized materials were characterized by pxrd and edx analysis .",
    "the lattice parameters were determined using the diffraction lines of lab@xmath16 as an internal standard .",
