    "cold - atom experiments have reached an impressive level of sophistication over the past decade .",
    "about ten different atomic species have been bose condensed and , although experimentally more challenging , an increasing number of fermionic species have been cooled to quantum degeneracy , including @xmath4he  @xcite , @xmath5li  @xcite , @xmath6k  @xcite and two yb isotopes ( @xmath7yb and @xmath8yb )  @xcite . to date , experiments on fermionic atoms have focused on studying bose - fermi mixtures  @xcite , one - component fermi systems with @xmath9-wave interactions  @xcite and equal - mass two - component fermi systems with interspecies @xmath10-wave interactions  @xcite .",
    "presently , the simultaneous trapping and cooling of two different fermionic species is being actively pursued by a number of laboratories  @xcite , adding a new degree of freedom , i.e. , the mass ratio between the two atomic species .",
    "unequal - mass two - component fermi systems are expected to behave quite differently than the equal - mass counterpart  @xcite . from the few - body perspective , the existence of weakly - bound trimers for sufficiently large mass ratios consisting of two heavy fermions and one light fermion is intriguing  @xcite .",
    "whether the existence of these bound trimer states allows , e.g. , for the formation of a gas consisting of trimers with sufficiently long lifetime has been discussed  @xcite . on the other hand , adopting a many - body perspective  @xcite , the ground state phase diagram of mass- and population - imbalanced two - component fermi systems has been predicted to show quantum and topological phase transitions which are not present in the phase diagram of population - balanced equal - mass two - component fermi systems .",
    "the increasing interest of not only the atomic physics community but also the nuclear physics , molecular physics , condensed matter physics and quantum information science communities in cold atom systems can be attributed to two major achievements .",
    "first , the atom - atom scattering length can be adjusted experimentally to essentially any value , including vanishingly small and infinitely large positive or negative values , by applying an external field in the vicinity of a so - called fano - feshbach resonance  @xcite .",
    "second , cold atomic gases can be loaded into an optical lattice  @xcite , allowing , e.g. , for the study of the mott - insulator transition  @xcite , a topic historically primarily considered by condensed matter physicists . furthermore , cold atom systems loaded into optical lattices may ultimately be used as a quantum simulator  @xcite .    to date , most microscopic studies of equal - mass systems have assumed equal trapping potentials of the two species  @xcite .",
    "however , the lattice potential felt by the two different hyperfine states may be different even for equal - mass systems , leading to trap - imbalanced systems  @xcite .",
    "for unequal - mass systems such as a @xmath5li-@xmath6k mixture ( for which the mass ratio @xmath11 is approximately @xmath12 ) , the trapping potentials felt by the two species are , in general , different , owing to the mass difference and the species - dependent properties of the hyperfine states .",
    "the trapping potentials felt by the two species may be tuned to some degree experimentally  @xcite .",
    "motivated by these considerations , the present paper explores the rich behavior of trap- and mass - imbalanced systems .",
    "these systems share some similarities with population - imbalanced systems  @xcite , which have received considerable attention recently .    assuming a deep lattice with neglegibly small tunneling between neighboring lattice sites , this paper determines the ground state properties of small @xmath10-wave interacting two - component fermi systems trapped by spherically symmetric harmonic species - specific potentials with trapping frequencies @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively . throughout",
    ", we adopt a microscopic many - body framework .",
    "our main results are : ( i ) for small but negative @xmath10-wave scattering lengths , we determine a compact expression for the ground state energy of small systems with unequal masses and trapping frequencies perturbatively .",
    "( ii ) in the strongly - interacting unitary regime , our numerical energies determine the phase diagram of optical lattice systems in the no - tunneling regime for a large range of mass ratios and trapping frequencies and the on - site interaction strengths that parametrize the corresponding lattice hamiltonian ; furthermore , they provide insights into the behavior of the excitation gap .",
    "( iii ) we show explicitly that the behavior of trap - imbalanced systems with small and positive @xmath10-wave scattering lengths is  just as that of trap - balanced systems  to leading order governed by the dimer - dimer scattering length .",

    "@xcite ) . equating the log - derivative of the inner and outer radial wave functions at @xmath93 results in a compact expression for the eigenequation , from which we obtain the eigenenergies @xmath94 of @xmath60 using standard root - finding techniques .",
    "the radial wave functions @xmath89 are then readily obtained by enforcing continuity at @xmath93 .",
    "we normalize the @xmath95 numerically .    to determine the eigenenergies of the two - particle hamiltonian @xmath58 with non - zero @xmath61 , we expand the full wave function @xmath78 in terms of the complete set @xmath96 . recognizing that @xmath58 commutes with the @xmath97-component of the total angular momentum operator ( i.e. , that @xmath98 is conserved ) , we restrict the allowed @xmath99 and @xmath100 combinations to @xmath101 . since the @xmath79 and @xmath80 are solutions of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are diagonal in this representation .",

    "the number of basis functions needed to converge the ground state energy to a given relative accuracy strongly depends on the interaction strength considered . at unitarity , e.g. , we need a larger basis set than in the regime where @xmath28 is small and positive ( see secs .  [ sec_large ] and [ sec_positive ] ) .",
    "the computational effort of diagonalization schemes such as that outlined above increases dramatically with increasing number of particles , and eventually becomes computationally unfeasible .",

    "our implementation of the fn - dmc method has been discussed in detail in two recent papers  @xcite ; here , we only review the key points .",
    "the fn - dmc technique , as used throughout this paper , determines an approximate energy of the many - body system whose corresponding eigenfunction has the same symmetry as a so - called guiding function @xmath107 , i.e. , the fn - dmc technique determines the energy of a state that has the same nodal surface as @xmath107 but that may differ from @xmath107 in other regions of the configuration space .",
    "if the nodal surface of @xmath107 coincides with that of the true eigenfunction , then the fn - dmc method results  within the statistical uncertainty that stems from the stochastic nature of the approach  in the exact eigenenergy .",
    "if the nodal surface of @xmath107 differs from that of the true eigenfunction , then the fn - dmc method results in an upper bound to the true eigenenergy whose eigenstate has the same symmetry as @xmath107 .",
