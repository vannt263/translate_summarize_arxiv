    "various expressions for the interaction energy of a _ point charge _ and a polarizable neutral particle have been successfully used before to calculate langevin type reaction rate constants for compound formation in gas - phase ion - neutral collisions in the mev to sub kev energy range ( see e.g. ref @xcite and references therein ) and for electron transfer reactions involving fullerenes @xcite or nanoparticles @xcite .",

    "further examples of extensions of the work of langevin describe interactions between point charges and permanent electrical dipoles with random or fixed orientations @xcite or induced dipole - induced dipole interactions between a point charge with uniform @xcite or orientation - dependent@xcite polarizability and a polarizable neutral . in the latter models @xcite the finite sizes of the collisions partners",
    "were indirectly taken into account by including polarizabilities and the number of outer shell electrons ( homo electrons ) as model parameters .",
    "this approach works well for small systems but for larger ones the actual geometrical sizes of both collision partners are expected to become important @xcite .",
    "draine and sutin @xcite considered the sizes of nanometer dust grains by treating them as metal spheres in interactions with point - charge ions . in the present work ,",
    "we calculate langevin type reaction cross sections ( i.e. the cross sections for compound formation ) for the interaction between two ( charged ) _ dielectric _ spheres and we present analytical expressions for electron ( or charge ) transfer between two dielectric spheres of finite sizes .    for high energies ( @xmath1 100 ev ) the classical langevin type reaction cross section is equal to the geometrical cross section @xmath2(@xmath3+@xmath4)@xmath5 of the two collision partners ( hard sphere collisions ) with radii @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "in this high energy regime , _ charge transfer _ cross sections are most often significantly larger than the geometrical cross section .",
    "the classical over - the - barrier model has been shown to accurately describe such processes in kev ion - atom @xcite , ion - fullerene@xcite , ion- pah @xcite , fullerene - fullerene @xcite , ion - surface @xcite and fullerene - surface collisions@xcite . in these models @xcite ,",
    "charge transfer takes place when the maximum of the potential energy barrier for the active electron equals the stark shifted ionization energy of the target . for fullerene and pah targets , analytical expressions for the potential energy barriers",
    "were derived assuming that these objects behave like metal spheres @xcite and infinitely thin metal discs @xcite , respectively .",
    "these are good assumptions for isolated fullerenes and pahs as they have been shown to display metallic behaviour when perturbed by external charges @xcite .",
    "however , weakly bound clusters of these species are expected to respond more like bulk material with dielectric constants in the @xmath6=5 - 7 range and it may thus be important to take finite @xmath6-values into account for more accurate descriptions of charge transfer processes in the general case .    in this work we present exact analytical expressions for the potential energy for an electron in the presence of two spheres with arbitrary charges , radii , and dielectric constants .",
    "these expressions may then be used to calculate absolute charge - exchange cross sections .",
    "it has previously been shown that the mutual polarization of two charged dielectric spheres in vacuum can be calculated using the image charge technique @xcite , from the surface charge densities @xcite , or with the aid of the so - called re - expansion method @xcite . in sec .",

    "further , we present approximate analytical expressions for the interaction energy of the two spheres and for the potential energy barrier for a point charge moving between the spheres , and demonstrate that these agree well with the corresponding exact analytical solutions . in sec . [ sec : applications ] we use these approximate expressions to calculate langevin type compound formation ( growth ) cross sections and electron transfer cross sections between nanometer - sized spherical objects .",
    "here , we describe the electrostatic interaction between two charged dielectric spheres @xcite and present the exact analytical solution for the interaction energy of a point charge in the presence of two dielectric spheres .",
    "we compare these solutions with much simpler approximate analytical expressions , which relate to an approximate expression for the electrostatic interaction between a point charge and a dielectric sphere ( as shown in appendix a ) .",

    "however , it is straightforward to introduce frequency dependencies by replacing @xmath10 and @xmath11 by @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the final expressions for the interaction energies and for charge transfer .",
    "dynamic effects are indeed important for e.g. collisions between kev highly charged ions and insulator or semiconductor surfaces@xcite , where the typical interaction time scales are on the order of 10@xmath14 s. this is comparable to time scales in some of the problems that could be treated using the present formulas .      the electrostatic potential at an arbitrary position p ( see fig .",

    "<S> these solutions , and the corresponding exact ones for sphere - sphere interaction energies , include sums that describe polarization effects to infinite orders in the inverse of the distance between the sphere centers . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we show that these exact solutions may be approximated by much simpler analytical expressions that are useful for many practical applications . </S>",
    "<S> this is exemplified through calculations of langevin type cross sections for forming a compound system of two colliding spheres and through calculations of electron transfer cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> we find that it is important to account for dielectric properties and finite sphere sizes in such calculations , which for example may be useful for describing the evolution , growth , and dynamics of nanometer sized dielectric objects such as molecular clusters or dust grains in different environments including astrophysical ones . </S>"
