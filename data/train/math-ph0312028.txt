    "graph models of quantum systems have a long history .",
    "already half a century ago ruedenberg and scherr @xcite used this idea , following a suggestion by l.  pauling , to calculate spectra of aromatic carbohydrate molecules ; they achieved a reasonable accuracy for such a simple model .",
    "however , a real boom started only from the late eighties when semiconductor graph - type structures became small and clean enough so that coherent effects in the corresponding quantum transport can play the dominating rle . due to the rapid progress in fabrication techniques new systems of these type",
    "appear every year , making both analysis of graph model properties and their physical justification an urgent task .",
    "for the sake of brevity we avoid giving a review of the field with the list of applications and restrict ourselves to quoting the surveys in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "our aim in the present paper is to contribute to the understanding of ways in which a graph - type description arises from investigation of some really existing systems . to explain what we have in mind , recall that the free hamiltonian of a graph model is the ( differential ) laplacian on the ( metric ) graph . to define it",
    "properly one has to specify the boundary conditions which couple the wave functions at the vertices .",
    "they have to define a self - adjoint operator , however , this requirement itself does not specify the conditions uniquely : in a vertex joining @xmath0 graph edges we have @xmath1 free parameters , as observed first in @xcite .",
    "this non - uniqueness represents the main weakness of graph models .",
    "a natural idea to mend it is to regard the model in question as a limit case of a more realistic one with a unique hamiltonian .",
    "an appropriate and natural choice is a `` thickened graph '' composed of thin tubes which have the same topology as the original graph and reduce to it in the limit of a vanishing tube radius .",
    "unfortunately , it is by far not easy to see what happens with spectral and/or scattering properties in such a limit .",
    "after a decade - long effort , the spectral convergence in the case when the `` thick graph '' is planar with neumann boundary conditions has been solved recently by kuchment ",
    "zeng @xcite , and rubinstein  schatzman @xcite ; saito  @xcite showed the convergence of the resolvent . can have arbitrary high ( finite ) multiplicity . ]    with the mentioned application to description of quantum wire systems in mind it is clear that an analogous situation in which the tube boundaries are dirichlet is even more important .",
    "unfortunately , it also very difficult and despite numerous efforts it remains an open problem .",
    "the main insight of the present paper is that these two cases do not exhaust all possible ways in which a family of manifolds can approach a graph .",
    "one more choice are manifolds without a boundary of codimension one in @xmath2 , which encloses the graph like a system of `` sleeves '' , with the limit consisting of the sleeve diameter shrinking .",
    "it is not only a mathematical question ; we draw the reader s attention to the fact that such sleeve - shaped tube systems are particularly interesting from the viewpoint of recent efforts to build circuits based on carbon nanotubes .",
    "recall that recently discovered techniques  see , e.g. , @xcite  allow to fabricate branched nanotubes and thus in principle objects very similar to the mentioned `` sleeved graphs '' .    on the mathematical side",
    "the main contribution of the paper is the treatment of the limit problem in a more abstract setting which covers the `` strip graphs '' of @xcite and their generalizations to higher dimensions , as well as the `` sleeved graphs '' described above .",
    "this is achieved by using the internal geometry of such a manifold only , so we need not suppose the latter is embedded in a euclidean space .",
    "our results even show that the limit is _ independent _ of a particular embedding . only the abstract graph data count .",
    "our conclusion will be that such a graph limit can give meaning to some type of vertex couplings , in particular , those representing a free motion through the junctions , as well as those which require to extend the graph state space by extra dimensions corresponding to the vertices . to get the full richness of the vertex behaviour , with possible relation to the graph geometry , more general limits will be needed .",
    "to characterize the results as well as the motivation in more details , we need some preliminaries ; we will do that in sections  [ ssec : laplacian.graph ] and  [ ssec : motivation ] .",
    "finally we give an application on the spectral convergence result in the case of periodic graphs .",
    "in particular , we show the existence of gaps in the spectrum of certain non - compact periodic graph - like manifolds .",
    "for example , attaching a loop at each vertex gives rise to spectral gaps ( cf .",
    "[ thm : gaps.ex.loop ] ) .",
    "let us briefly describe the structure of the paper . in section  [ sec : prelim ] we define the laplacian on a graph and give an abstract eigenvalue comparison tool ( lemma  [ lem : main ] ) . in section  [ sec : graph.mfd ]",

    "the operator and the quadratic form are related by @xmath22 for @xmath23 belonging to the domain of @xmath20 . on the edge @xmath6 , the operator @xmath20",

    "there are other self - adjoint operators which act according to ( [ eq : formaledge ] ) on the graph edges but satisfy different boundary conditions at the vertices  see @xcite for details .",
    "the corresponding quadratic forms differ from ( [ eq : graphform ] ) by an extra term . in general",
    "there are many admissible boundary conditions ; a graph vertex joining @xmath0 edges gives rise to a family with @xmath1 real parameters .",
    "an example is represented by the so - called @xmath31 coupling for which the corresponding domain consists of all functions @xmath25 which are twice weakly differentiable on each edge , and ( [ eq : kirchhoff ] ) is replaced by @xmath32 with a fixed @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the common value of all the @xmath35 at the vertex .",
    "one can ask naturally whether such graph hamiltonians can be obtained from a family of graph - shaped manifolds . in section  [ sec : borderline ] we will discuss a particular case of the limiting procedure leading to the spectrum which  although it does _ not _ correspond to a graph operator with the generalized boundary condition described above  is at least _",
    "similar _ to that with a @xmath31 coupling .",
    "the difference is that in the boundary conditions ( [ eq : delta ] ) the coupling constant @xmath36 is replaced by a quantity dependent on the spectral parameter , the corresponding operator being defined not on @xmath37 but on a slightly enlarged hilbert space  cf .",
