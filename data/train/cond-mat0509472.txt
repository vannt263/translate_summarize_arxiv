    "the half - heusler phases _ xyz _ , comprising three interpenetrating _ fcc _ lattices , constitute an important class of materials with particular regard to their magnetic properties .",
    "de groot@xcite and coworkers showed a number of years ago that the half - heusler compound nimnsb can be described as a half - metallic ferromagnet , whose computed band structure resembles a metal in one spin direction , and a semiconductor in the other . since then , and indeed , even prior to that , it has been recognized that the electronic structure and hence properties of heusler compounds@xcite and half - heusler compounds@xcite are very sensitive to the valence electron count .",
    "a number of electronic structural studies have been carried out on the half - heuslers .",
    "we focus here on those studies which systematically address behavior in families of half - heusler compounds , rather than studies focused on individual ones . from the viewpoint of chemical bonding in these compounds , whangbo and coworkers@xcite have examined the non - magnetic band structures , using the extended hckel method , of a number of half - heusler compounds with varying valence electron counts .",
    "these authors have recognized that many _",
    "half - heuslers can be thought of as comprising an _ _ x__@xmath5 ion stuffing a zinc blende _ _ yz__@xmath6 sublattice where the number of valence electrons associated with _ _ yz__@xmath6 are 18 ( @xmath7 + @xmath8 + @xmath9 ) .",
    "18 electron compounds are therefore closed shell species ; non - magnetic and semiconducting .",
    "they further suggest that the 17 and 19 electron _",
    "xyz _ would undergo a stoner instability@xcite to a ferromagnetic ground state , while the 22 electron compounds ( typically with mn@xmath10 at the _ x _ site ) should be localized moment ferromagnets .",
    "the 22 electrons divide themselves into 13 in the majority spin and 9 in the minority spin direction , resulting in a semiconducting gap ( half - metallic behavior ) in the minority spin direction .",
    "recently , galanakis _ _ et al.__@xcite have placed this `` 18 electron '' rule on a more formal footing .",
    "pierre _ _ et al.__@xcite were amongst the first to recognize the importance of the valence electron count in the half - heuslers . in more recent work , tobola and pierre@xcite have emphasized the importance of covalency in these compounds .",
    "the _ z _ element is often a pnictogen ( as , sb or bi ) or some other main group element because only covalent bonding would justify the somewhat open half - heusler structure .",
    "t and rabe@xcite have examined the electronic structures of the compounds _ _ x__nisn with _ x _ = ti , zr , or hf , and interpreted phase stability and the nature of band gaps . also important from the approach that we will take here",
    "is the work of wood , zunger , and de groot@xcite who have examined a number of non - magnetic `` stuffed zinc blende '' semiconductors , the so - called nowotny - juza compounds@xcite including half - heusler phases such as liznp , in order to control the nature of the band gap ( direct or indirect ) .",
    "nanda and dasgupta@xcite have examined nearly 20 different half - heusler compounds using the fp - lmto and lmto - asa methods , including a detailed analysis of the bonding and the nature of the band gaps .",
    "they argue as we do here , for the very important role played by covalent bonding in these systems .",
    "they ascribe half - metallicity to arise in some of the half - heuslers due to the large _",
    "y_-_z _ covalency , in conjunction with",
    "large exchange -splitting due to highly magnetic _ x _ ions .    in this contribution",
    ", we focus on chemical bonding in 8 , 18 and magnetic half - heusler compounds , and attempt to relate the electronic structure to simple concepts such as the electronegativity of the component species . we also demonstrate covalency and the local nature of the magnetic moment in the magnetic compounds using real - space descriptors derived from first principles theory .",

    "density functional theory - based electronic structure calculations were performed using the full - potential linear augmented plane wave ( lapw ) code wien2k@xcite to optimize cell volumes of the different half - heusler compounds described here .",
    "the electronic structural descriptions made use of linear muffin tin orbital ( lmto ) calculations within the local spin density approximation , as implemented in the stuttgart tb - lmto - asa program.@xcite starting structures for lmto calculations were obtained from the results of volume optimization using wien2k .",

    "we discuss these results here in detail .        in the three panels of figure2 , we compare the densities of states near the fermi energy ( taken as the top of the valence band , and set as the origin ) for 6 different li__yz _ _ half - heusler compounds . in panel",

    "we compare lialsi with isoelectronic si in the diamond structure .",
    "the electronic structures display a remarkable similarity in the nature and extents of the valence and conduction bands .",
    "this strong similarity has been noted previously by christenson@xcite and is fully in keeping with the description of lialsi being a zintl or valence compound,@xcite wherein the identical electron counts of ( alsi)@xmath2 and ( sisi ) in turn imply that the structures would be similar .",
    "it should be noted that mg@xmath22si in the fluorite structure also obeys the same rule , if we recognize it can be recast as mg@xmath23(mgsi)@xmath24 with the ( mgsi)@xmath24 crystallizing in a zinc blende lattice .",
    "indeed the electronic structure of mgsi@xmath22@xcite is quite similar to what we find for lialsi .",
    "the change in the space group , comparing ( @xmath25 ) mg@xmath22si and ( @xmath0 ) lialsi arises because the atoms in the _ x _ and _ y _ sites in the former are identical .",
    "the similarity in the electronic structures of si and stuffed zinc blende compounds is further emphasized through an analysis of the si - si , the al - si , and the mg - n cohps of the three different compounds : si , lialsi , and limgn , shown in figure3 .",
    "the dashed line in this figure is an integration of the cohp up to @xmath26 , yielding a number that is indicative of the strength of the bonding .",
    "not only are the extents of the bonding and antibonding cohps of si and lialsi very similar , but so is the value of the integrated cohp : near -1.5ev _ per _ interaction for si and for lialsi .",
    "we interpret this as indicative of very similar extents of covalency in the diamond lattice of si and the zinc blende sublattice of lialsi .",
    "this value is slightly reduced in the more polar limgn , and the nature of the cohp is different as well .",
    "the isosurfaces are decorated by the value of the electron localization function .",
    "the color - bar at the bottom of the figure indicates increasing localization from left ( 0.0 ) to right ( 1.0 ) .",

    "these are high values of localization ( the elf scale as used here @xcite runs from 0 through 1 ) and indicate highly covalent bonding between si ( cyan spheres ) in the elemental structure , as well as between al ( blue ) and si ( cyan ) in lialsi , and between mg ( blue ) and n ( cyan ) in limgn .",
    "the elf takes on a curious hemispherical shape in limgn , reflecting the large electronegativity difference between mg and n. the blob of localization is also closer to n than it is to mg . it must be noted that there is no localization around li ( orange spheres ) in either lialsi , or limgn , as seen also from the map of the elf projected on the ( 010 ) plane at the rear of the unit cells .",
    "li behaves effectively like ionic li@xmath1 . in panels",

    "bonds distort charges from being spherical , so distortions should be interpreted as covalency .",
    "ionic species on the other hand , would have spherical charge around the nucleus .",
    "we observe the highly covalent nature of the diamond lattice in si , and the zinc blende sublattice in lialsi . for limgn ,",

    "= li can be written li@xmath1(_yz_)@xmath2 , we use the data in table1 to examine systematics in the band gaps of these compounds .",
    "we find the computed ( lmto ) gaps of li__yz _ _ to vary approximately as the difference of the pauling electronegativities of _ y _ and _ z_. the larger the difference in electronegativity of the species in the zinc - blende sublattice ( _ y _ and _ z _ ) , the greater the band gap as a result of band narrowing . the trend can not be used quantitatively , but only as and indicator of the phillips - van vechten - like@xcite behavior that is seen in these complex semiconductors .",
    "it should be noted that the siting of _ y _ in the tetrahedral position simultaneously allows the more polar pair of _ x _ and _ z _ to form a stable rock salt structure . from the viewpoint of lattice energy , this is perhaps the greater stabilizing influence on the half - heusler structure .      to examine whether similar rules hold for 18-electron half - heusler compounds , we start by presenting in table2 the results of density functional calculations on a series of _ xyz _ compounds where _ x _ is electropositive yttrium . the zinc blende lattice is formed by a later transition metal _ y _ , and a main group element _ z_. all the compounds are semiconductors according to lmto calculations , with band gaps ranging from 0ev for yaupb to 0.53ev for ynias .",

    "y _ to emerge .",
    "projections of the densities of state on the different atomic levels ( not displayed ) reveal that the valence band has _",
    "@xmath31 character and _ z _ @xmath32 character .",
    "the conduction band has some of the character from these states , but in addition , has empty @xmath31 states from the _ x _ atom .",
    "this fits with our expectation of the _ x _ atom being nearly fully ionized ( or more accurately , having attained the group valence ) and the @xmath31 shell of the _ y _ atom being filled as a result .",
    "the gap is largest for ticosb , and smallest for ynisb . when both _",
    "x _ and _ y _ are changed , it is more difficult to seek trends in the gap .",
    "the gap in vfesb is reduced due to v and fe not being well separated in electronegativity .",
    "the gap in ynisn is reduced because the unoccupied y 4@xmath31 states are rather broad , at least within lsda .",
    "what is evident is that compounds with co on the _ y _ site have a strong propensity to maintain `` clean '' gaps as further seen in panel ( b ) of this figure where the dos of ticosb , vcosn , and nbcosn are displayed .        from figure8 , we see that even in these transition - metal rich phases , we can perform a bonding analysis based on cohps .",
    "these are shown for all pairwise interactions in the two half - heuslers vfesb and ticosb . integrating the cohps , we find that the strongest bonding interactions are between _ y _ and _ z _ ( co and sb , and fe and sb ) while the interactions between the early and late transition metal ( ti and co , and v and fe ) are also significant .",
    "the compounds are electronically very stable as seen from a complete absence of any antibonding interaction below the top of the valence band .",
    "the fact that the 18-electron compounds are clearly valence compounds with the band gap being located between bonding and antibonding levels supports our description of these phases being zintl - like .",
    "the band gaps in vfesb and ticosb would seem to be determined by bonding between _ x _ and _ y _ , so at first sight , it would seem that at least these two transition - metal rich phases should not be described simply as cation - stuffed zinc blendes .",
    "however , as we shall see from the elf analysis , the _ localized _ bonding remains in the zinc blende _ yz _ lattice .",
    "weak bonding and antibonding cohps between _ x _ and _ z _ ( ti and sb , and v and sb ) support the view that the _ xz _ rock salt sublattice is ionic in character .",
    "figure9 , displays electron localization functions for the two 18-electron half - heusler compounds for which the cohps are displayed in figure8 , namely ticosb and vfesb .",
    "the elfss , visualized respectively for values of 0.73 and 0.71 in figure.9(a ) and 9(b ) are clearly indicative of strongly covalent bonding in the zinc blende sublattice , with ticosb displaying the greater tendency to covalent bonding .",
    "as we observed in the 8-electron compounds , localization isosurface is closer to the more electronegative sb atoms .",
    "it must be pointed out here that the elf is notoriously difficult to apply in @xmath31 electron system , and the fact that the localization emerges so clearly here is compelling evidence for dealing with these systems as if they were valence compounds with strongly covalent bonding .",
    "the valence charge densities displayed in figure9(c ) and 9(d ) are very distinct from what was seen for the 8-electron compounds , because the filled @xmath31 shell on _ y _ forms a large nearly spherical blobs around that atom , visualized for a charge density of 0.06@xmath28@xmath29 .",
    "we find that these blobs of charge are pulled out into four strongly localized ( as seen from the coloring ) lobes arranged tetrahedrally and facing _",
    "z_. interestingly , in vfesb , there is also some @xmath31-like localization around v , and there is some little localization seen on the isosurface between v and fe .",
    "the smaller electronegativity difference between v and fe , when compared with the electronegativity difference between ti and co , in conjunction with the nature of cohps displayed in figure8 leads us to point this out as the origin for the smaller band gap of vfesb .",
    "another argument that one can proffer is that ticosb has greater polar intermetallic character,@xcite with strong covalent ti - co bonds .",
    "v and fe are closer together in electronegativity , and the high formal charge state ( v@xmath33 ) is much more covalent .",
    "this results in a smaller band gap in vfesb .    in the next subsection",

    "x_-co interaction is seen to be highly spin - polarized .",
    "the origin of the half - metallicity is revealed by the clear separation of antibonding _ majority _ states which cross the fermi energy from the antibonding _",

    "this allows us to make the following generalization : the 18-electron half - heuslers are the most stable phases , with well separated bonding and antibonding states .",
    "additional electrons ( more than 18 ) must go into antibonding states and these are split by spin - polarization and separated into majority and minority states . while these compounds are intrinsically less stable than the 18-electron compounds , they maximize their stability by ensuring that minority antibonding states remain unoccupied . the co - sb interaction in these two compounds is seen to be strongly covalent , but not very much affected by spin - polarization .",
