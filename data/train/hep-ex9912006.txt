    "charmonium physics is always one of the interesting and intriguing fields of particle physics .",
    "charmonium provides us an excellent and simple system to study qcd , the production and decay mechanisms of heavy quarkonia and light hadron spectra from its decays , and can be treated nonrelativistically and perturbatively . using @xmath0 sample collected with the beijing spectrometer ( bes ) at bepc , the recent @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath3 results are presented .",
    "the bes detector is described in detail in ref .",
    "0.1 cm out of the charmonium decays , there exists a mysterious and longstanding @xmath6 puzzle of @xmath7 and @xmath1 decays @xcite , first revealed by mark - ii collaboration . in qcd , both @xmath1 and @xmath8 decays are expected to be dominated by annihilations into three gluons . based on the similarity between the @xmath1 and @xmath8 wave functions and the slow running of the strong interaction coupling constant @xmath9 ,",
    "the non - relativistic perturbative qcd predicts @xcite : the ratios of the decays widths of @xmath4 into hadrons to those of @xmath7 into hadrons are : @xmath10 named as the `` @xmath11 '' rule .",
    "mark ii first observed the vector - pseudoscalar ( v for vector , p pseudoscalar , b baryon , a axial - vector and t tensor ) @xmath6 and @xmath12 channels are highly suppressed w.r.t .",
    "the @xmath13  expectation  known as the @xmath6 puzzle .",
    "bes has confirmed the puzzle with much lower upper limit by a suppression factor of @xmath14 and observed new highly suppressed decay modes , meanwhile bes presents many observations ( table [ hadronic ] ) .    from table",
    "[ hadronic ] , a large number of @xmath4 decay branching ratios have been measured , and most for the first time @xcite . and",
    "it is found that some vp , vpp , vt , pbb and ap decay modes are suppressed w.r.t .",
    "the @xmath13  rule , where vt modes @xcite is the first evidence for suppression other than vp . while for @xmath4 decays into ap modes @xcite , the normal decay @xmath15 , enhanced mode @xmath16 and suppressed decay @xmath17 are observed .",
    "the @xmath13  rule holds for the radiative decays into vt modes @xcite within errors , but it is suppressed for the decays into vp modes@xcite . now the suppressed decays also extend to the 3-body decays , but the @xmath13  rule holds for the baryonic decays @xcite .",
    "quite a few models @xcite have been put forward to explain the puzzle , but none of them is satisfactory . from the measured results , it has also been observed that the * strong double ozi ( dozi ) violation * in @xmath18 and the isospin violation in the decays between @xmath19 and the isospin - conserving and su(3)-allowed decay @xmath20 , and",
