    "inside a granular material forces are distributed very inhomogeneously : a small number of particles carries a large fraction of the internal forces @xcite .",
    "these large fluctuations are reflected in the force probability density functions , which typically decay exponentially @xcite .",
    "the behavior for small forces is not as well understood as the generic exponential tail : the @xmath2-model appears to predict a vanishing probability density for small forces @xcite , whereas experiments and simulations clearly show that this probability remains non - zero @xcite .",
    "the characterization and understanding of this probability remains a challenge , especially since the force distribution is believed to play an important role for the dynamical arrest or `` jamming '' of granular and other disordered materials @xcite . in particular , the force distribution has been observed to develop a small peak ( around the average value ) in simulations of supercooled liquids , foams and granular matter undergoing a jamming transition @xcite . however , there is still no microscopic understanding how this effect relates to the properties of the force network .     denotes the distance from the bottom .",
    "the force network is represented by the black lines whose thickness is proportional to the force - magnitude . _",

    "while the distribution of forces @xmath3 is the primary object one ultimately wishes to characterize , it is difficult to access experimentally . experiments with photoelastic materials are able to depict the spatial structure of bulk forces in 2d , but their precision to resolve individual contact forces is limited @xcite .",
    "only recently , there have been first reports of 3d bulk measurements on forces in compressed emulsions @xcite .",
    "most quantitative information on the force probability distribution is at present only accessible through measurements of the _ particle - wall forces _ from imprints on carbon paper @xcite or by force sensors @xcite .",
    "each particle - wall force has to balance all interparticle forces that are exerted on the corresponding particle from above , see fig .",
    "[ fig.weights ] .",
    "this means that experiments essentially measure a combination of forces that we refer to as the _ weights _ of the bottom particles .",
    "for simplicitly , we will focus on frictionless spheres for which these weights are defined as @xmath8 here @xmath9 denotes mass , @xmath10 denotes gravity , @xmath11 are the interparticle forces and @xmath12 is the number of particle exerting a force on particle @xmath13 _ from above _ ; the sum runs over all these forces .",
    "so , to relate the experimental results to the bulk force distributions , one has to understand the relation between weights and forces .    in this paper",
    "we will show how the _ local packing geometry _ plays the crucial role in the relation between the force distributions @xmath0 and the weight distributions @xmath1 ( we define @xmath14 and @xmath15 as the appropriately rescaled forces and weights ) .",
    "our central point is that while the distribution of @xmath16 is robust , the distribution of @xmath17 is profoundly influenced by the contact geometry , in particular by _ the number of downward pointing contact forces _",
    "@xmath12 . in simulations of hertzian sphere packings",
    "we will find that @xmath18 is different from @xmath19 , due to the rather special packing geometry near a boundary .",
    "however , for many ( but not all ) experimentally relevant situations , the special packing geometry near a boundary makes @xmath20 rather close , but not equal , to the bulk @xmath0 .",
    "this fortunate but non - trivial coincidence can be understood easily within our framework .",
    "we will , however , also provide two examples where @xmath18 and bulk @xmath0 are significantly different .",
    "additional motivation for studying the relation between forces , weights and geometry comes from the @xmath2-model @xcite .",
    "once the distinction between forces and weights has been made , one notices that the @xmath2-model is a lattice model in which _ weights _ are randomly redistributed over a fixed number of supporting grains .",
    "the @xmath2-model displays a weight distribution that is qualitatively different from both experimentally observed weight distributions , or numerically obtained force distributions .",
    "we will show that this is due to the fixed connectedness of the @xmath2-model .",
    "realistic @xmath1 can be obtained if we allow for the connectivity to vary within the @xmath2-model , e.g. by introducing random connectivity .",
    "our work then serves three purposes .",
    "first of all , it helps to interpret data obtained by measurements of particle - wall forces : this paper includes a section where we explicitly apply our framework to recent experimental data of highly compressed packings @xcite .",
    "secondly , it shows how the simple @xmath2-model can be extended to obtain very realistic weight distributions for both regular and irregular packings .",
    "since the model is known to give incorrect predictions on spatial propagation @xcite , our intention is not to fine - tune the model and its parameters , but rather to indicate how the contact geometry is essential to describe force and weight fluctuations in more realistic packings .",
    "thirdly , we address the question of how force fluctuations build up as a function of the distance beneath the top surface , providing another fundamental test for theoretical models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec.pf ] we first explain our numerical method and then discuss the force distributions observed in amorphous packings : it turns out that @xmath0 is rather insensitive to the packing geometry .",
    "we then show in sec .",
    "[ sec.pw ] that the weight distributions @xmath1 , on the other hand , are very sensitive to the packing geometry . using simple phase space considerations , we relate @xmath1 to @xmath0 for a given geometry .",
    "this provides a recipe how to reconstruct the bulk @xmath0 from the experimental data , and in sec .",
    "[ sec.exp ] we explicitly apply this to recent experimental data on highly compressed packings @xcite . in particular , our analysis strongly suggests that @xmath0 is essentially unaffected by the tremendous deformations encountered in the experiments .",
    "we then indicate some limitations of our framework in sec .  [ beyond ] , where we address subtle packing problems like the effect of gravity . in sec .",
    "[ sec.qmodel1 ] we investigate to what extent the @xmath2-model can describe the results of the numerical packings of hertzian spheres : we derive a surprising exact result for the bond quantities @xmath21 , and we investigate the role of disorder in the packing geometry .",

    "[ sec.qmodel2 ] .",
    "we find no evidence in the hertzian sphere packings for the power - law relaxation predicted by the @xmath2-model , indicating that the model is not able to capture this spatial aspect of the force network .",
    "the paper ends with a discussion .",
    "in this section we study the distribution of interparticle forces via simulations of 2d packings of frictionless spheres . after introducing our numerical method in sec .",
    "[ subsec.method ] , we discuss the similarities between @xmath0 in the bulk and near the boundary ( sec .",

    "our two - dimensional packings consist of frictionless spheres ( 3d ) under gravity .",
    "the packings are created from molecular dynamics simulations of spheres that interact through normal hertzian forces , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 denotes the overlap distance @xcite .",
    "since hertz s law for 2d disks is linear in @xmath24 , we use 3d spheres .",
    "these particles reside in a container that is @xmath25 particle diameters wide , with periodic boundary conditions in the horizontal direction .",
    "the bottom support is rigid and also has a frictionless hertzian interaction with the particles .",
    "we construct our stationary packings by letting the particles relax from a gas - like state by introducing a dissipative force that acts whenever the overlap distance is non - zero . in this paper",
    "we use two different polydispersities : the radii @xmath26 are drawn from a flat distribution between either @xmath27 or @xmath28 .",
    "the masses are proportional to the radii cubed . in the former case of almost monodisperse particles ,",
    "the particles tend to crystallize into a triangular lattice ( sec .",
    "[ subsec.crystal ] ) , whereas the more polydisperse particles lead to amorphous packings such as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.weights]a .",
    "this allows us to study how the packing geometry affects the force network .",
    "the results shown in this paper are obtained with particles that deform @xmath29 under their own weight .",
    "simulations of harder particles ( deformation @xmath30 ) gave similar results as those shown here @xcite .",
    "the various data were obtained from @xmath31 realizations containing @xmath32 particles each .",
    "we study the force and weight distributions at various heights @xmath33 .",
    "to do so , we divide each packing into horizontal slices of one particle diameter thickness , and rescale all forces and weights in each layer to the corresponding average ( absolute ) values . the rescaled interparticle forces and weights",
    "will be denoted by @xmath34 and @xmath17 respectively , with distributions @xmath35 and @xmath1 .",
    "we first analyze the statistics of the absolute values @xmath36 , whose probability density function @xmath0 is usually referred to as the distribution of ( interparticle ) forces ; our main finding will be that @xmath0 in bulk and near the boundary are very similar . in fig .",

    "@xcite who found that @xmath0 crosses over to a gaussian for large particle deformations ; we have used rather ` soft ' particles in our simulations for which deformations are relatively large , i.e. up to @xmath38 .",

    ", @xmath0 approaches a finite value .",
    "the small peak around @xmath39 for bulk forces becomes a plateau for the layer - to - layer forces near the bottom ; it is intruiging to note that this change is reminiscent of what is proposed as an identification of the jamming transition @xcite .",
    "after studying the absolute values of @xmath41 , let us investigate the _ orientations _ of the interparticle forces .",
    "we therefore define @xmath42 as the angle between @xmath41 and the horizontal axis . in fig .",

    "the presence of the bottom wall aligns the bottom particles and as a consequence their interparticle forces become almost purely horizontal , see fig .",

    "[ fig.pfz ] , there is a substantial difference between @xmath40 in the bulk ( open circles ) and @xmath40 for the layer - to - layer forces near the bottom ( dots ) .",

    "this is indeed confirmed by direct comparison of the dotted datasets of figs .",
    "[ fig.pfamorph ] and  [ fig.pfz ] .     in the bulk ( open circles ) and for the layer - to - layer forces ( dots ) .",

    "taking a uniform angle distribution @xmath56 , we obtain ( appendix  [ app.logdiv ] ) @xmath57 numerical integration of this equation with @xmath0 from fig .",
    "[ fig.pfamorph ] yields the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig.pfz ] , which closely corresponds to the @xmath40 as measured in the bulk ( open circles ) . in appendix  [ app.logdiv ] , we show that the integral of eq .",
    "( [ pfzdiv ] ) is weakly divergent for small @xmath47 : @xmath58 the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig.pfz ] shows that our data for @xmath40 is indeed consistent with this logarithmic divergence .",
    "let us briefly summarize the results of this section .",
    "the geometrical constraint imposed by the bottom wall locally induces a packing geometry which is different from the bulk geometry .",
    "whereas this is strongly reflected in the orientations of the @xmath41 , the distribution of the absolute values @xmath0 is very robust .",
    "the probabilities for the components of the @xmath41 can be obtained with great precision , including the logarithmic divergence , by the transformation of eq .",
    "( [ pfztrafo ] ) .",
    "in this section , we demonstrate that the local packing geometry has a dramatic effect on the weight distribution of @xmath1 . as stated in the introduction , experiments can only measure the particle - wall forces at the boundary of a granular packing , and not the interparticle ( bulk ) forces that were discussed in the previous section . since these particle - wall forces are essentially equal to the weights of the bottom particles , it is important to understand the relation between the weight distribution @xmath1 and the distribution of interparticle forces @xmath35 .",
    "in the first part of this section we develop a simple geometrical framework to understand this relation , based on phase space considerations .",
    "we then show that this explains , to a large extent , the weight distributions @xmath1 as measured in our simulations of hertzian spheres .",
    "in particular , we observe substantial differences between weight distributions for different packing geometries .      if we interpret eq .",
    "( [ defweight ] ) as a transformation of stochastic variables , it is possible to relate the corresponding probability density functions as @xmath59 here , we have neglected the term @xmath60 , since @xmath61 far below the top surface of the packing .",
    "the number of forces over which we integrate differs from grain to grain , and it turns out to be crucial to label the weight distribution in eq .",
    "( [ trafo ] ) , @xmath62 , according to this number @xmath12 .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "the @xmath24-function constrains the integral on a @xmath63 dimensional hyperplane of the total phase space , and the `` area '' of this hyperplane scales as @xmath64 .",
    "we thus anticipate the following scaling behavior for small weights : @xmath65 provided that the joint probability density approaches a finite value when all @xmath66 .",
    "such scaling is also implicit in the @xmath2-model @xcite , although there @xmath67 so that @xmath68 .",
    "the particles that do not feel a force from above , @xmath69 , give a @xmath24-like contribution at @xmath70 ; for deep layers this occurs for @xmath71 . in a disordered packing , the number of particles that exert a force from above can vary from grain to grain .",
    "the total weight distribution @xmath72 , therefore , is a superposition of the @xmath62 : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the fraction of particles with @xmath12 contacts from above .",
    "this means that the small weight behavior of @xmath72 depends very much on the fractions @xmath74 and thus on the local packing geometry , via eqs .",
    "( [ pncscaling ] )  and  ( [ pwdecomp ] ) .",
    "the steepness of the tail of the total weight distribution depends strongly on the @xmath74 as well .",
    "to explain this , let us assume that all vertical forces @xmath75 contributing to the weight are uncorrelated .",
    "we consider @xmath76 , i.e. @xmath77 for large forces .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ trafo ] ) that the weight distribution takes over this same exponent @xmath78 , so that @xmath79",
    ". however , the @xmath62 s are not properly normalized : @xmath80 , since each of the @xmath75 gives an average contribution @xmath81 .",
    "this yields a total average weight @xmath82 . in order to compare with experimental and theoretical results we have to rescale the weights so that @xmath83 , yielding the following large weight behavior :    @xmath84    this simple calculation shows that , for a given value of @xmath85 , the steepness of the tail of the experimentally measured weight distribution is very sensitive to the local packing geometry",
    "this is a direct consequence of keeping @xmath86 fixed to unity : a decrease of probability for small weights must lead to a steeper tail for large weights in order to leave the average weight unaltered .",
    "note that this general argument is not restricted to uncorrelated @xmath75 or exponential tails .",
    "a generalization to other than exponential tails is given in appendix  [ app.tails ] .",
    "so , we have advanced a simple picture , in which the shape of @xmath1 _ depends strongly on the local packing geometry _ via the fractions @xmath74 .",
    "the small force behavior follows from eqs .",

    "the values of @xmath125 are taken from table i of ref .",
    "@xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      we have seen that for particles with @xmath136 or vice versa , the small weight behavior is @xmath137 , which is different from the scaling predicted by eq .",
    "( [ pncscaling ] ) . this breakdown of our simple picture can be understood as follows .",
    "a particle that has 4 contacts can either have @xmath136 , @xmath138 or @xmath139 depending on the precise orientations of the forces with respect to gravity .",
    "however , if we were to define the weights by projecting the @xmath11 at a small angle with respect to gravity , a particle with 4 contacts can easily change from @xmath136 to @xmath140 or even to @xmath141 .",
    "however , we have seen that there is no `` preferred '' projection direction , since gravity has only very little effect on our packings . hence , it is not surprising that the @xmath142 depend on @xmath143 and not on @xmath12 or @xmath144 individually .",
    "but what determines the precise scaling for small weights ? consider a particle @xmath145 with @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "the three forces pushing it from above , @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 , are not independent : force equilibrium in the direction perpendicular to @xmath151 ( the force pushing from below ) requires @xmath152 , where @xmath153 .",
    "this reduces the number of independent forces from above to only 2 , since the third is determined by mechanical equilibrium . as a consequence ,",
    "the scaling behavior for small @xmath17 will be @xmath154 .    for particles with @xmath146 and @xmath155 ,",
    "the 5 forces are also coupled through mechanical equilibrium . in this case , however , one can not distil a relation between the forces from above only , such as we did for particles with @xmath156 .",

    "[ sec.pw ] , for bulk particles . at the bottom",
    "our analysis is still valid : horizontal equilibrium can be accomplished by the forces between neighboring bottom particles ( see fig .",

    "we have addressed the limitations of our simple geometrical framework .",
    "we have shown that the observation that @xmath94 is insensitive to packing geometry originates from excluded volume - like correlations between the angles at which forces press upon a bead ( fig .",
    "[ fig.phinc ] ) .",
    "this is the subtle underlying reason why our simple picture , where we characterize the local packing geometry by only one number @xmath12 , is good enough to interpret experimental and numerical data .",

    "this further refines the analysis of the relation between packing geometry and force network statistics in the bulk of a packing ; at the boundary , it is sufficient to consider only the number of contacts from above ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "in this section , we investigate to what extent the results obtained for the hertzian sphere packings can be understood within the context of the @xmath2-model and its generalizations . in the standard version of the model ,",

    "the weight on a particle @xmath145 splits up into @xmath12 fractions @xmath159 , and the total weight exerted on a particle @xmath13 in the layer below then becomes @xmath160 where the term @xmath60 can be neglected at large depth .",
    "the fractions @xmath159 obey the constraint @xmath161 which assures mechanical equilibrium in the vertical direction .",
    "they can in principle also be deduced for more realistic packings : from definition ( [ defweight ] ) , one finds @xmath162 .",
    "the simple form of the @xmath2-model has allowed for a number of exact results of which the most important is the solution for the uniform @xmath2-distribution .",
    "this uniform @xmath2-distribution assigns an equal probability to each set of @xmath163 that obeys eq .",

    "the @xmath2-model is thus an effective minimal model for the weights @xmath4 .",
    "it is clear that the product of @xmath159 and @xmath167 has a natural interpretion as the vertical component of @xmath11 .",

    "finally note that since the downward @xmath2-values are statistically independent from the weights , the `` force '' fluctuations simply follow from @xmath212 , and thus display the same relaxation as the weights fluctuations .     in the 3d @xmath2-model . since we plot @xmath207 along the vertical axis",

    "( [ mapping2 ] ) . however , we find no evidence for such a slow relaxation in our simulations of hertzian spheres , which indicate that a bulk distribution is reached after approximately 10 layers of particles ( fig .",

    ", the second moment after @xmath214 layers still differs around @xmath215 from its asymptotic value .",
    "let us provide two possible explanations why the @xmath2-model fails to describe this relaxation process .",
    "a first problem of the model is that it assumes some fixed @xmath2-distribution @xmath216 : we have seen that the @xmath2 s can in principle be derived from the forces as @xmath217 , so a relaxation in @xmath0 and @xmath1 should result into a relaxation of @xmath216 itself .",
    "this clearly shows the difficulty of encoding the force behavior into a stochastic variable @xmath2 in a self - consistent manner .",
    "another problem of the model is that it assumes a top - down propagation of forces .",
    "the up - down symmetry is therefore broken explicitly in the @xmath2-model , whereas in our hertzian sphere packings we find only a very weak symmetry breaking . in principle , force networks are defined by the equations of mechanical equilibrium , which generically are _ underdetermined _ @xcite and hence can not be solved by an iterative ( top - down ) procedure .",
    "instead , one has to solve this set of coupled equations `` simultaneously '' for all particles in the system , and except for the ( small ) @xmath60 term , there is a natural up - down symmetry in this system .",
    "the absence of this up - down symmetry in the @xmath2-model could of course strongly affect the top - down relaxation .",
    "we have shown that in order to understand the statistics of force networks , it is crucial to distinguish between forces and weights . we have found in our simulations that the force distribution @xmath0 is very robust , in the sense that its shape does not depend on details of packing geometry .",
    "the weight distribution @xmath1 , on the other hand , is very sensitive for the local packing geometry .",
    "we have demonstrated that a decomposition according to the number of contacts that press on a particle from above , @xmath12 , is sufficient to understand this geometry dependence . reinterpreting experiments on strongly deformed rubber particles @xcite within this framework",
    ", we find strong evidence that @xmath0 essentially remains unaffected even by very large particle deformations . to further test our framework experimentally",
    ", one can manipulate the number of contacts at the boundary by placing a layer of relatively small or large beads at the bottom . for small beads , the fractions @xmath107 and @xmath108",

    "relatively large bottom beads should lead to a @xmath1 that is strongly peaked .",
    "the present work provokes a number of questions .",
    "first , we observe that most of our simulation results , like the shapes of @xmath40 and @xmath1 , can be understood in terms of _ local _ packing geometry only .",

    "we therefore question whether the behavior of @xmath0 observed at the jamming transition @xcite reflects a long - range structural change of the force network .",
    "in particular , we expect that the role of ` force chains ' can only be understood from two or more - point correlation functions , and not from @xmath0 only .",
    "a related problem is that the @xmath2-model fails to describe problems that involve spatial structure of the force network .",
    "although the model is able to capture many features of force and weight statistics ( sec .",
    "[ sec.qmodel1 ] ) , it does not produce the top - down relaxation of @xmath1 that is observed in the more realistic hertzian packings . alongside with the incorrect prediction of the response function @xcite",
    ", this indicates that spatial dependence is not correctly incorporated within the @xmath2-model .",
    "this may be due to the fact that , in general , recursive models do not acknowledge the structure of the equations describing mechanical equilibrium .",

    "we consider decays both faster and slower than exponential , of the form      we show that , after rescaling @xmath86 to unity , this leads to @xmath232 with @xmath233 this means that the tail of the weight distribution is of the same nature as that of the forces , but with a different prefactor @xmath125 .",
    "the tails get steeper for increasing @xmath12 , since the reduced probability for small @xmath17 ( due to a lack of phase space ) must be compensated to keep @xmath100 .          for @xmath239",
    ", the probability density on @xmath236 has a maximum at @xmath240 , which becomes sharply peaked for increasing @xmath4 .",
    "physically , this means that the dominant contribution for large weights will come from all @xmath75 being equal , namely @xmath241 . approximating the integrand by a gaussian around its maximum value , we find that the `` width '' decreases as a power of @xmath4 only , namely @xmath242 . hence the leading behavior for large @xmath4",
    "is given by the maximum value of the integrand , i.e. @xmath243 .    for @xmath244 , the probability density has a minimum at @xmath240 , and the dominant contribution now comes from @xmath245 and @xmath246 .",
    "this means that typically only one of the forces accounts for the whole weight .",
    "the part of the integral around @xmath245 can be approximated by      where @xmath248 denotes the part of @xmath236 for which @xmath249 .",
    "this approximation becomes exact for @xmath250 as long as @xmath251 ; we take @xmath252 with @xmath253 .",
    "working out the integration over @xmath248 , one finds      as @xmath255 .",
    "the part of the integral outside the areas @xmath248 is smaller than @xmath256 and can thus be neglected .",
    "so also for @xmath244 , the leading behavior for large @xmath4 is simply given by the maximum value , i.e. @xmath257 .",
    "as mentioned in sec .",

    "there is a slight difference between the packings of ` soft ' particles ( deformation @xmath29 ) and ` hard ' particles ( deformation @xmath30 ) .",
    "the average coordination number of the hard particles is smaller than that of the soft particles , leading to a significant number of _ rattlers _ , i.e. particles that feel no force from above .",
    "since the forces carrying these rattlers are of the order @xmath259 , they show up as @xmath24-peaks at zero force ( see also sec .",
    "[ subsec.pf ] ) ; besides these @xmath24-peaks , @xmath0 in both systems are virtually indistinguishable .",
    "when determining the value of @xmath12 , we explicitly exclude the intralayer bottom contacts ; for the strongly polydisperse packings , these correspond to angles that deviate less than @xmath260 from the horizontal . for our estimates of the bulk @xmath74 s",
    "we do not exclude any forces , i.e. , the `` cutoff angle '' is strictly @xmath261 .",
    "since the bulk is isotropic , a cutoff angle of @xmath260 leads to a change of the order of 15% , far too little to explain the change of @xmath108 by a factor of more than 4 . for simplicity",
    "we therefore have kept a `` cutoff angle '' of @xmath261 in the bulk .    to determine the precise value of @xmath97 is a very subtle problem . since the total weight distribtution @xmath1 is normalized such that @xmath262 , the average weight of particles with @xmath96 will be smaller than unity and @xmath95 should be rescaled with a factor @xmath263 . incorporating this in a self - consistent manner",
    ", we obtained very similar @xmath117 as those presented in table  [ tabrubber ] , where we took @xmath120 for simplicity .",
    "this diffusion in correlation space should not be confused with the diffusion in real space due to a localized force on the top surface . in our case",
    "we have homogeneous initial conditions as all weights in the top layer are equal ."
