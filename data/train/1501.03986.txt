    "we conjecture that , for each connected , compact plane set @xmath1 with more than one point , @xmath0 is complete if and only if @xmath1 is pointwise regular . we shall prove that this is true for a variety of somewhat exotic connected , compact plane sets .",
    "we shall also describe some other connected , compact plane sets for which we have not been able to determine whether or not this is the case .    in @xcite , the notion of @xmath3-derivative was introduced in order to describe the completions of the spaces @xmath0 ; here @xmath3 is a suitable set of rectifiable paths lying in a compact plane set @xmath1 . we shall remove an unnecessary restriction on the sets of paths considered in @xcite . we shall also introduce a generalization of the standard notion of pointwise regularity for compact plane sets in order to further strengthen some of the results of @xcite .",
    "we shall then investigate further the completeness of the spaces @xmath0 for compact plane sets @xmath1 , and discuss their completions .",
    "in particular , we shall answer a problem raised in @xcite by constructing a radially self - absorbing , compact plane set @xmath1 such that @xmath0 is not complete .",
