    "in a model of large extra dimensions ( add model ) @xcite , the fundamental planck scale can be as low as a few tev , which is made possible by localizing the sm particles on a brane while gravity is free to propagate in all dimensions .",
    "the observed planck scale ( @xmath1 gev ) is then a derived quantity .",
    "signatures for the add model can be divided into two categories : sub - planckian and trans - planckian .",
    "the former has been studied extensively , while the latter just recently received more attention , especially black hole production in hadronic collisions .",
    "the fact that the fundamental planck scale is as low as tev opens up an interesting possibility of producing a large number of black holes at collider experiments ( e.g. lhc ) @xcite .",
    "reference @xcite showed that a bh localized on a brane will radiate mainly in the brane , instead of radiating into the kaluza - klein states of gravitons of the bulk . in this case , the bh so produced will decay mainly into the sm particles , which can then be detected in the detector .",
    "this opportunity has enabled investigation of the properties of bh at terrestrial collider experiments .",
    "an important quantity of a bh is its entropy @xmath2 . to fulfill the thermodynamical description , a bh requires a large entropy of order of 25 @xcite .",
    "such an entropy requirement implies that the bh mass must be at least five times the fundamental planck scale @xcite .",
    "this mass requirement makes the bh production not as large as previously calculated in a number of works @xcite , first pointed out in ref .",
    "in addition , the signature of large multiplicity decay of a bh can only happen when the entropy is large . even taking into account this mass requirement ,",
    "the event rate is still large enough for detection .",
    "a typical signature of the bh decay is a high multiplicity , isothermal event , very much like a spherical  fireball . \"",
    "other interesting trans - planckian phenomena include string balls @xcite and @xmath0-branes @xcite .",
    "dimopoulos and emparan @xcite pointed out that when a bh reaches a minimum mass , it transits into a state of highly excited and jagged strings  a string ball ( sb ) .",
    "the transition point is at @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the string scale and @xmath5 is the string coupling .",
    "naively , sb s are stringy progenitors of bh s .",
    "the bh correspondence principle states that properties of a bh with a mass @xmath6 match those of a string ball with @xmath7 .",
    "we can then equate the production cross sections of sb and bh at the transition point .",
    "the existence of string balls could be argued from the string point of view .",
    "when the energy of the scattering reaches the string scale , the scattering of particles is no longer described by point - particle scattering but replaced by string - string scattering .",
    "as the energy goes further up , the strings become highly excited , jagged and entangled string states , and become like a string ball .",
    "when the energy reaches the transition point , it turns into a bh . in the above we mentioned a large entropy requirement on the bh in order for the object to be a bh .",
    "such a large mass requirement makes the production cross section smaller than previously thought .",
    "here in the case of sb s , the mass requirement is substantially lower , thus the production rate is significantly higher .",
    "hence , an sb is more interesting in the experimental point of view if it decays with a distinct signature .",
    "dimopoulos and emparan @xcite argued that the decay of a sb is similar to that of a bh , i.e. , a high multiplicity decay into the sm particles , though in some intermediate stages the sb decays more likely into bulk particles .",
    "a @xmath0-brane is a solution to the einstein equation in higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "a bh can be considered a @xmath8-brane .",
    "in fact , the properties of @xmath0-branes reduce to those of a bh in the limit @xmath9 . in extra dimension models ,",
    "in which there are large extra dimensions and small extra dimensions of the size of the planck length , let a @xmath0-brane wrap on @xmath10 small and @xmath11 large dimensions .",
    "it was found @xcite that the production of @xmath0-branes is comparable to bh s only when @xmath12 , i.e. , the @xmath0-brane wraps entirely on the small dimensions only . if @xmath13 , the production of @xmath0-branes would be suppressed by powers of @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the fundamental scale of the @xmath16 dimensions .",
    "therefore , here we only consider the case in which @xmath12 .",
    "the decay of @xmath0 branes is not well understood .",
    "one interesting possibility is cascade into branes of lower dimensions until they reach the dimension of zero . whether the zero brane is stable depends on the model .",
    "another possibility is the decay into brane and bulk particles , thus experimentally the decay can be observed . or it can be a combination of cascade into lower - dimensional branes and direct decays .",
    "@xmath0-brane production in the unconfined scenario ( e.g. in universal extra dimensions or fat - brane scenario ) was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "bh production has also been studied in cosmic ray experiments and neutrino telescopes @xcite , which are complementary to or even better than the lhc for bh discovery .",
    "a black hole is characterized by its schwarzschild radius @xmath17 and its entropy , which depend on the mass @xmath18 of the bh .",
    "a simplified picture for bh production is as follows . when the colliding partons have a center - of - mass ( c.o.m .",
    ") energy above some thresholds of order of the planck mass and the _ impact parameter _",
    "less than the schwarzschild radius @xmath17 , a bh is formed and almost at rest in the c.o.m . frame .",
    "the bh so produced will decay thermally ( regardless of the incoming particles ) and thus isotropically in that frame .",
    "the schwarzschild radius @xmath17 of a bh of mass @xmath18 in @xmath16 dimensions is given by @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is introduced for convenience and @xmath21 is the fundamental planck scale .",
    "the radius @xmath17 is much smaller than the size of the extra dimensions .",
    "when the colliding partons with a center - of - mass energy @xmath22 pass within a distance less than @xmath17 , a black hole of mass @xmath18 is formed and the rest of the energy , if there is any , is radiated as ordinary sm particles @xcite .",
    "this semiclassical argument calls for a geometric approximation for the cross section for producing a bh of mass @xmath18 as @xmath23 in the @xmath24 subprocess , the c.o.m .",
    "energy of the colliding partons is just the same as the mass of the bh , i.e. , @xmath25 , which implies a subprocess cross section @xmath26 on the other hand , for the @xmath27 subprocesses the subprocess cross section is @xmath28    the entropy of a bh is given by @xcite @xmath29 to ensure the validity of the above classical description of a bh @xcite , the entropy must be sufficiently large , of order 25 or so .",
    "we verified that when @xmath30 , the entropy @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "therefore , to avoid getting into the nonperturbative regime of the bh and to ensure the validity of the semiclassical formula , we restrict the mass of the bh to be @xmath32 .      according to the bh correspondence principle",
    ", the production cross section of a string ball or a bh should be smoothly joined at @xmath33 , i.e. , @xmath34 the production cross section for string balls with mass between the string scale @xmath4 and @xmath35 grows with @xmath36 until @xmath35 , beyond which , due to unitarity , it should stay constant .",
    "therefore , we can use the bh cross section and match to the string ball cross section at the transition point @xmath37 .",
    "this string ball cross section then stays constant between @xmath35 and @xmath37 .",
    "then below @xmath35 the string ball cross section grows like @xmath38 .",
    "the cross sections for the sb or bh are given by @xmath39 ^ 2 &                           \\frac{m_s}{g_s^2 } \\le m_{\\rm bh } \\\\",

    "since on the brane there are many more particles than in the bulk , the bh decays dominantly into brane modes , i.e. , the sm particles in the setup .",

    "blindly \" into all degrees of freedom . the ratio of the degrees of freedom for gauge bosons , quarks , and leptons is @xmath152 ( the higgs boson is not included ) .",
    "since the @xmath153 and @xmath154 decay with a branching ratio of about 70% into quarks , and the gluon also gives rise to hadronic activities , the final ratio of hadronic to leptonic activities in the bh decay is about @xmath155 @xcite .",
    "another important property of the bh decay is the large number of particles , in accord with the large entropy in eq .",
    "( [ entropy ] ) , in the process of evaporation .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the average multiplicity @xmath156 in the decay of a bh is order of @xmath157 for @xmath18 being a few times @xmath21 for @xmath158 .",
    "since we are considering the bh that has an entropy of order 25 or more , it guarantees a high multiplicity bh decay .",
    "the bh decays more or less isotropically and each decay particle has an average energy of a few hundred gev .",
    "therefore , if the bh is at rest , the event is very much like a spherical event with many particles of hundreds of gev pointing back to the interaction point ( very much like a fireball ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the bh is produced in association with other sm particles ( as in a @xmath159 subprocess ) , the bh decay will be a boosted spherical event on one side ( a boosted fireball ) , the transverse momentum of which is balanced by a few particles on the other side @xcite .",
    "such spectacular events should have a negligible background .",
    "highly excited long strings emit massless quanta with a thermal spectrum at the _",
    "hagedorn _ temperature . at @xmath160 , the wavelength",
    "@xmath151 corresponding to the thermal spectrum at the hagedorn temperature is larger than @xmath161 .",
    "this argument is very similar to that of the bh , and so the string ball radiates like a point source and emits in @xmath36-waves equally into brane and bulk modes . with many more particles ( sm particles ) on the brane",
    "than in the bulk , the sb radiates mainly into the sm particles .",
    "when @xmath162 goes below @xmath37 , the sb has the tendency to puff up to a _ random - walk size _ as large as the @xmath151 of the emissions @xcite .",
    "therefore , it will see more of the higher angular momentum states available in the extra dimensions .",
    "thus , it decays more into the bulk modes , but it is only temporary .",
    "when the sb decays further , it shrinks back to the string size and emits as a point source again @xcite .",
    "most of the time the sb decays into sm particles . on average",
