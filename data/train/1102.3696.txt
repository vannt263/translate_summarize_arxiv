    "in the solar neighborhood a significant amount of main sequence stars are cool stars of spectral class m. stars with spectral type m7 and later , sometimes called `` ultracool m dwarfs '' , are optically very faint , making them difficult to identify in optical , near - infrared and high proper motion sky surveys .",
    "they may , however , be characterized by strong x - ray flares .",
    "x - ray flares can provide clues on the size of the x - ray emitting structures and on the underlying physical processes that produce very energetic events .",
    "the soft x - ray light curves of stellar flares are typically characterized by a fast rise phase , followed by a slower decay , and the analysis of the decay phase can be used to diagnose the flaring loops length @xcite .",
    "a sudden increase of temperature and emission measure of solar and stellar coronal flares is caused by strong heat pulses of the plasma confined in single or groups of magnetic loops .",
    "the flare in ultracool dwarfs suggests a presence of magnetic activity in the outer atmospheric layers of these stars . in massive solar type stars ,",
    "magnetic activity is generated at the interface layer between the radiative core and outer convection zone .",
    "however , around spectral type m5/m6 or later , the stellar interior is fully convective and short - term enhancements of the emission in various wavebands are attributed to flares due to magnetic reconnection .",
    "@xcite .",
    "flares in active late k and m dwarfs commonly show short lived events with typical duration of minutes to tens of minutes and integrated x - ray energies of @xmath5 to @xmath6  erg @xcite . however ,",
    "occasionally intense long duration events lasting from a few to several hours are also observed from m dwarfs stars @xcite .",
    "many m dwarfs are also known to show x - ray flares with flux increases up to a factor 100 to 200 ( robrade & schmitt 2009 , and references therein ) .",
    "nearly all late type stars emit x - rays believed to originate in @xmath7 to @xmath8  k plasma confined in closed magnetic structures @xcite .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of these objects is commonly modeled as two thermal components corresponding to two distinct types of loop atmosphere .",
    "the low temperature component , or quiet region , has temperature around ( 2 - 4)@xmath9  k , while the high temperature component , or active region , has typical temperature around @xmath10  k @xcite .",
    "it has been observed that , in active m dwarfs , the hot component contributes a relatively larger fraction of the total x - ray emission and is also responsible for the variability in the x - ray light curve @xcite .",
    "the low temperature component dominates the x - ray emission in inactive dwarfs with little or no variability in the light curves .    as part of a campaign to characterize the properties of the diffuse x - ray background @xcite we performed a 100  ks _ xmm - newton _ observation of the nearby star forming cloud mbm20 to a flux limit of @xmath11  ergs  @xmath12  s@xmath2 in the energy band ( 0.5 - 2 )  kev .",
    "several bright point sources were detected during the observation , most of them background active galactic nuclei , but we also observed some foreground ( galactic ) stars .",
    "one of the sources identified ( 2xmm  j043527.2 - 144301 ) was below the threshold for source detection during the first half of the observation , becoming one of the brightest sources in the field during the second half .",
    "a detailed analysis of the data showed that this was due to two consecutive x - ray flares from the source happening toward the end of the observation . with the source location obtained from the second half of the observation",
    ", we also verified that the source was actually visible , although below our threshold for detection , during the first half of the observation , providing the rare opportunity of observing , in the same data set , both quiescent state and the two flares . by comparing the sources location with available catalogs , we were also able to identify the source as a cool m - class dwarf in the solar neighborhood , with a faint 2mass counterpart ( 2mass  j04352724 - 1443017 ) .",
    "in this paper we detail our analysis of the flares and quiescent state from the x - ray source , and the corresponding 2mass counterpart . in section 2",
    "we describe the observation and data reduction , while in section 3 we focus on the data analysis .",
    "in particular , in section 3.1 we discuss the timing analysis of the x - ray flares , section 3.2 is dedicated to the analysis of the optical and nir counterpart , and section 3.3 to the spectral analysis of the x - ray source . a summary and conclusions",

    "the xmm - sas task _ xmmselect _ was used to extract the light - curves and spectra of the source and background .",
    "we selected a circular region of radius 25  around the source position to extract the light - curve and spectra of the source ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "to extract the background light - curve and spectra we used two different approches ( regions ) .",

    "however during the quiescent period the source was very faint , with an average count rate of 0.0021  counts  s@xmath2 , corresponding to an increase of more than 52 in the count rate from quiescent to peak .",

    "since most of the emission from the source is in the energy range of 0.2 - 2.0  kev , as expected from late type dwarf , we limited our spectral fitting to the 0.2 - 2.0  kev energy range .",
    "we grouped the spectrum to have 15 counts per channel .",
    "the 1 t thermal plasma models gave unacceptably high values for reduced chi square ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 ) , however , the spectral model with 2 t thermal plasma resulted in better fits .",
