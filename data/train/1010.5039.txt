    "in this section , we first review the action of the non - abelian holographic superconductor and give the equations of motion ( eoms ) of the model with a nonvanishing vector potential . then , after numerically solving the eoms , we give the results and their physical meanings .",
    "the action of the @xmath0-wave holographic superconductor includes the einstein - hilbert action and an su(2 ) gauge field , which is called the einstein - yang - mills ( eym ) theory .",

    "for convenience we set @xmath34 in our calculation .    using the euler - lagrange equations , one can obtain the equations of motion for the gauge fields , @xmath35 for the @xmath0-wave backgrounds , in order to study the dc current of the model",

    "then the energy density near the horizon has a contribution from @xmath62 which diverges as @xmath63 at the horizon @xmath34 .",
    "this unphysical behaviors means that there is no supercurrent for the non - superconducting state since @xmath46 must be a constant .",
    "however , the non - superconducting state can have a superfluidity with value @xmath58 .",
    "we will come back to this issue again when we calculate the free energy later .      to study the behaviors of a @xmath0-wave model with supercurrent means that we have to solve the equations of motion with fixed @xmath7 .",
    "we can also solve the equations with a fixed @xmath8 , which corresponds to studying the phases of a superconductor with a fixed superfluidity velocity .",
    "this has been done in ref .",
    "the first important problem to study is how the order parameter changes with the temperature for this holographic superconductor with current .     versus @xmath64 for @xmath7=1/10 , 1/100 , 1/1000 ( from the right to the left ) .",

    "1 it can be seen that when the supercurrent is not zero , there are two solutions of the order parameter corresponding to a fixed temperature . in the next section",
    "we will show that the solution with lower value of the order parameter takes a larger free energy than the solution with larger values of the order parameter and therefore it is unfavorable .",
    "the critical temperature decreases as the current increases , which indicates that there should exist a critical current above which there is no superconductivity .",
    "when one lowers the temperature from a temperature above the critical one , the order of phase transition at the critical temperature for a fixed current should be a first order one , since the order parameter jumps from zero to a finite value at the critical temperature .",
    "such a jump will certainly change the energy and so requires some latent heat , which implies that the phase transition should be a first order one .",
    "this conclusion is the same as the one we shall give from observing the curve of the current @xmath7 versus the superfluid velocity @xmath8 at a fixed temperature .",
    "this result is different from the one obtained for the case of a fixed superfluidity velocity , where at small velocity the phase transition is still a second order one .",
    "when the velocity becomes larger , the phase transition turns to be of first order @xcite . for the @xmath5-wave holographic superconductor with current",
    ", the order parameter is also bivaluated , and the states with lower value of the condensate have a larger free energy than their counterparts with larger values of the condensate at the same temperature .",
    "this is the same as the result of a @xmath0-wave holographic superconductor .      to confirm that compared with the state with larger parameter , the state with lower parameter is unfavorable , we need to compare their free energies .",
    "the free energy of the field theory is determined by the value of the yang - mills action ( ignoring the back - reaction of the gauge fields on the metric ) @xmath66 evaluated on - shell up to boundary counterterms , @xmath67 , where the ellipsis denotes boundary terms that we should introduce to regulate the action when needed .",

    "we can see that the on - shell action @xmath68 is not divergent and no counterterms are needed .",
    "since @xmath79 is fixed to be zero , for a spatially homogenous system , the free energy density of the field theory takes the following form @xmath80 where @xmath81 .    in fig .",
    "2 we present the free energy of a fixed current @xmath82 for the two branches of solution .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the solution with a larger value of the order parameter has a lower free energy .    .",
    "the blue dotted line corresponds to the points with a lower value of the condensate at a given temperature .",

    "it can be seen that the lower branch corresponds indeed to states with larger free energy and is thus metastable.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    of course , the best way to show that the phase transition at the critical temperature is of first order is to compare the free energy between the superconducting state and the non - superconducting state with current .",
    "however , this is not possible in this model , since there is no non - superconducting state with a fixed current as is discussed at the end of section a. nevertheless , with the fact that the order parameter goes discontinuously at the phase transition point , there should be no problem to conclude that the phase transition is a first order one .",
    "another physical quantity by which one can compare the difference between the gravity model of superconductor and the g - l theory is the relation between the current and the superfluidity velocity at a fixed temperature . from this relation",

    "3 correspond to the temperature @xmath83 .",
    "for these two temperatures the critical current are @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "it can be clearly seen that for temperatures close to @xmath2 , where the g - l theory works very well , the plots of @xmath7 versus @xmath8 is the same as that of g - l theory . from these plots",
    "we can also know the order of the phase transitions at critical current or critical velocity .",
    "for the plots of @xmath83 , the maximal velocity corresponds to a vanishing current , which means that the phase transitions at critical velocities @xmath89 and @xmath90 are of second order .",
    "the third plot corresponding to a larger temperature @xmath87 is different .",
    "the maximal velocity corresponds to a non - vanishing current , which means that the phase transition at the critical velocity is a first order one .",
    "so we can conclude that for small critical velocity the phase transition is a second order transition , while for large enough velocity the phase transition becomes a first order one .",
    "these are consistent with the model with a @xmath1 background at a fixed superfluidity velocity @xcite .",
    "we can also check our results by the curve of the order parameter versus the temperature for a fixed velocity ( rather than a fixed current ) , which is plotted in fig 4 . from fig .",
    "4 it can be seen that for a small value of the current @xmath91 , the condensation goes continuously at the critical temperature , which means that the phase transition is a second order one . while for a larger value of the current @xmath92 , which corresponds to the maximal value of the current in the third curve of fig .",
    "3 , the condensation goes discontinuously at the critical temperature .",
    "this indicates that the phase transition is a first order one .",
    "according to the computation of the free energy in refs .",
    "@xcite , it shows that the curve of the condensation versus the temperature , such as the right one , is indeed the sign of a first order phase transition .",
    "an interesting thing is that all the results we obtain above are similar to that of the @xmath5-wave model @xcite .",
    "and the right panel corresponds to @xmath92.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]   and the right panel corresponds to @xmath92.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]      in this subsection we study the critical current @xmath84 for different @xmath64 near @xmath2 to compare the results with that of the g - l theory . as predicted by g - l theory , @xmath84 is proportional to @xmath93 when the temperature is close to @xmath2 . as illustrated in fig .",
    "5 , this scaling behavior is indeed obeyed by holographic superconductors for temperatures close to @xmath2 , and this is also the case in the @xmath5-wave model @xcite .",
    "another prediction of the g - l theory is that , at any fixed temperature , the norm of the condensate decreases monotonically with the velocity from its maximal value , the maximal value @xmath94 corresponding to zero velocity and zero current . as is shown in fig .",
