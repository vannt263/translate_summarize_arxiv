    "in a previous paper @xcite we analyzed the exclusive processes of charm pseudoscalar meson @xmath12 photoproduction , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , or @xmath11 .",
    "we consider here the exclusive processes of charmed vector meson @xmath15 photoproduction , @xmath16 , on proton and neutron targets .",
    "no detailed theoretical analysis exists for such processes , and up to now , experimentally , only an indirect evaluation of their cross section has been done . in @xcite",
    "an attempt has been done to estimate the contribution of the processes @xmath17 to the asymmetry of the collisions of a circularly polarized photon beam with a polarized target in @xmath18 open charm @xmath19 .",
    "it is well known , that such asymmetry is sensitive to the @xmath20 gluon contribution to the nucleon spin @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the d - exchange contribution has been calculated for @xmath21 , in the near threshold region , considering the possible baryon exchange as a background process .",
    "let us list some arguments to justify the interest in exclusive charmed vector meson photoproduction :    * their contribution to the total cross section is important , especially in the near - threshold region ; * the understanding of the reaction mechanisms require the deconvolution of these channels ; * these reactions naturally explain the particle - antiparticle asymmetry in charmed particles photoproduction , at high energies ; * the polarization phenomena induced by the production of vector meson are new , interesting and measurable ( the @xmath22-meson is a self analyzing particle , through the angular dependence of the decay products in @xmath23 , but this decay does not allow to access the vector @xmath22-meson polarization ) ; * direct experimental data , concerning these reactions , are expected soon , due to the higher luminosity of ongoing experiments , as compass @xcite .",
    "there are essential differences beween the processes of exclusive photoproduction of light vector mesons ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 or @xmath27 ) and heavy @xmath22-production . in the last case ,",
    "the diffractive mechanism is absent and the large mass of the @xmath28-quark seems to justify the applicability of perturbative qcd .",
    "however there is no direct relation between the photon - gluon fusion subprocess , @xmath29 and the exclusive @xmath22-photoproduction .",
    "therefore , qcd - inspired models , like the effective lagrangian approach ( ela ) , in terms of hadronic degrees of freedom , as charmed baryons and mesons , seem more appropriate .",
    "in such approach , it is possible to predict the differential cross section and all polarization observables in terms of a finite number of coupling constants , of strong and electromagnetic nature - in any kinematical condition .",
    "the same coupling constants enter also in the calculation of other processes of associative charm production in @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32-collisons .",
    "there are experimental data about inclusive @xmath22 photoproduction , @xmath33 or @xmath34 up to hera energies @xcite .",
    "the smallest energy , where @xmath22-photoproduction has been observed is @xmath35 gev , at slac @xcite . typically , @xmath22-production is the main channel for @xmath36 charm @xmath19 @xcite , so that the ratio between the vector ( @xmath37 ) and the total @xmath22 contribution to the total cross section is in agreement with the spin quark rule @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the pseudoscalar contribution .",
    "the relative role of the charged and neutral @xmath40-meson photoproduction depends , on one side , on the relative cross sections for the @xmath41 and @xmath42 photoproduction , and , from another side , on the branching ratio for the decays @xmath43 ( for different charge combinations ) .",
    "we consider here the exclusive processes @xmath16 , in case of collinear kinematics , where helicity conservation and the p - invariance of electromagnetic interaction allow three amplitudes , only , which are functions of a single kinematical variable , the photon energy @xmath4 .",
    "note , in this respect , that generally the processes @xmath16 are characterized by a set of twelve independent amplitudes , which are complex functions of two kinematical variables .",
    "therefore the theoretical analysis is largely simplified in collinear kinematics .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii the spin structure of the collinear matrix element is parametrized in terms of three amplitudes , which allows to develop a general and model independent formalism for the analysis of polarization phenomena .",
    "the expressions for the different possible pole contributions , in framework of ela approach , are derived in section iii .",
    "the strong and electromagnetic coupling constants as well as the form factors are discussed in section iv .",
    "numerical predictions for the differential cross section , the single and double - spin polarization observables , as functions of @xmath4 , are given in section v. concluding remarks are given in section vi .",
    "the appendix contains the explicit expressions of the collinear amplitudes .",
    "we consider here the processes @xmath16 , @xmath14 , or @xmath11 , @xmath5=@xmath44 or @xmath45 , in collinear regime , i.e. for @xmath46 or @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the @xmath45-production angle in the reaction cms .",
    "the reasons of this choice are the following :    * the differential cross section , @xmath49 , as a rule , is maximal in the forward direction ( @xmath50 is the momentum transfer squared ) ; * the total helicity of the interacting particles is conserved , for any reaction mechanisms , which implies that the spin structure of the matrix element and the polarization phenomena are highly simplified .      taking into account the p - invariance of the electromagnetic interaction of charmed particles and the helicity conservation ,",
    "one can write the following general parametrization of the matrix element for any process @xmath51 , in collinear kinematics ( which holds for any reaction mechanism ) : @xmath52\\chi_1 , \\label{eq : mat}\\ ] ] with the following notations :    * @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the two - component spinors of the initial nucleon and the produced @xmath8-hyperon , * @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the three vector of the photon and of the @xmath5-meson polarizations , with the condition @xmath57 , * @xmath58 is the unit vector along the three - momentum of @xmath59 ; * @xmath60 , @xmath61=1 - 3 , are the collinear amplitudes , which are generally complex functions of a single variable , @xmath4 .    using this parametrization",
    ", one can find for the differential cross section : @xmath62 , \\label{eq : cs1}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 is a normalization factor , @xmath64 @xmath65 is the energy ( mass ) of the produced vector meson : @xmath66 where @xmath67 @xmath68 is the nucleon ( @xmath8-hyperon ) mass , @xmath4 is the photon energy in the laboratory ( lab ) system .",
    "the @xmath69-mesons , produced in collinear kinematics , are generally polarized , ( with tensor polarization ) even in collisions of unpolarized particles : @xmath70 with the normalization condition : @xmath71 .",
    "the non - diagonal elements for @xmath72 are equal to zero , in collinear regime .",
    "all the other single - spin polarization observables , such as the @xmath73-asymmetry ( with linearly polarized photons interacting with unpolarized target ) , the analyzing power @xmath74 ( induced by polarized nucleon target ) and the final @xmath8-polarization ( in the collision of unpolarized particles ) , vanish for the considered reactions , for any photon energy and for any reaction mechanism , due to the axial symmetry of collinear kinematics .",
    "however an interesting set of double - spin polarization observables can be measured , for the reactions @xmath16 :    * * the asymmetry @xmath7 * in the collision of circularly polarized photon beam , with a polarized nucleon target , in the @xmath58-direction , which we choose as the @xmath75-direction , @xmath76 due to the p - invariance of the electromagnetic interaction , the asymmetry for a linearly polarized photon beam vanish , even in collisions with polarized target . in the same way , the linear photon polarization can not induce any polarization of the emitted @xmath8-hyperon ( for simplicity , we will assume here 100% photon polarization , with helicity @xmath77 ) .",
    "* in the collision of circularly polarized photons with unpolarized target , the @xmath8-hyperon can be longitudinally polarized , and * the polarization @xmath9 * is : @xmath78 * the nonzero components of * the depolarization tensor , @xmath79 * , describing the dependence of the @xmath80-component of the @xmath8-polarization on the @xmath81-component of the target polarization can be written as : @xmath82    one can see that these observables are not independent , and the following relations hold , at any photon energy and for any reaction mechanism : @xmath83 these formulas show which experiments are necessary to determine the moduli of the collinear amplitudes , @xmath84 : latexmath:[\\ ] ]      e.  tomasi - gustafsson and m.  p.  rekalo , arxiv : hep - ph/0310172 .",
