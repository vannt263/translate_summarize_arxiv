    "there is an ongoing interest in the theory of interaction of charged particle beams with plasmas .",
    "although most theoretical works have reported on the energy loss of ions in a plasma without magnetic field , the strongly magnetized case has not yet received as much attention as the field - free case .",
    "the energy loss of ion beams and the related processes in magnetized plasmas are important in many areas of physics such as transport , heating , magnetic confinement of thermonuclear plasmas , and astrophysics .",
    "recent applications are the cooling of heavy - ion beams by electrons @xcite and the energy transfer for magnetized target fusion @xcite , or heavy - ion inertial confinement fusion .    for a theoretical description of the energy loss of ions in a plasma ,",
    "there exist some standard approaches .",
    "the dielectric linear response ( lr ) treatment considers the ion as a perturbation of the target plasma and the stopping is caused by the polarization of the surrounding medium .",
    "it is generally valid if the ion couples weakly to the target . since the early 1960s ,",
    "a number of calculations of the stopping power within lr treatment in a magnetized plasma have been presented ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "alternatively , the stopping is calculated as a result of the energy transfers in successive binary collisions ( bcs ) between the ion and the electrons @xcite .",
    "here it is necessary to consider appropriate approximations for the screening of the coulomb potential by the plasma @xcite .",
    "however , significant gaps between these approaches involve the crucial ion stopping along magnetic field @xmath0 and perpendicular to it . in particular , at high @xmath1 values ,",
    "the bc predicts a vanishingly parallel energy loss , which remains at variance with the nonzero lr one . also challenging bc - lr discrepancies persist in the transverse direction , especially for vanishingly small ion projectile velocity @xmath2 when the friction coefficient contains an anomalous term diverging logarithmically at @xmath3 @xcite . for calculation of the energy loss of an ion two new alternative approaches",
    "have been recently suggested .",
    "one of these methods is specifically aimed at a low - velocity energy loss , which is expressed in terms of velocity  velocity correlation and , hence , to a diffusion coefficient @xcite .",
    "next in ref .",
    "@xcite using the bhatnagar - krook - gross approach based on the boltzmann - poisson equations for a collisional and magnetized classical plasma the energy loss of an ion is studied through a lr approach , which is constructed such that it conserves particle local number .",
    "previous treatments of the energy loss of charged particles in a magnetized plasma @xcite were obtained by treating the plasma in an average manner , i.e. , microscopic fluctuations were neglected . however , any media and , in particular , any plasma being a statistical system , is characterized by stochastic fluctuations .",
    "these fluctuations couple to external perturbations and the response of the medium to these perturbations can be expressed through suitable correlation functions of the microscopically fluctuating variables .",
    "it is well known that the motion of charged particles in such an environment is stochastic in nature and resembles brownian motion .",
    "the effect of the electromagnetic field fluctuations on the energy loss of a charged particle moving in an unmagnetized classical plasma has been studied by several authors in the past @xcite .",
    "this effect leads to an energy gain of the particles and is most effective in the low  velocity limit .",
    "in addition the effect of the fluctuations are mainly important for light particles ( e.g. , for an electron ) since this effect is inversely proportional to the mass of the particle and is negligible for heavy ions .",
    "recently similar problem has been formulated for the energy loss in a so  called quark - gluon plasma @xcite which is expected to be formed in relativistic heavy  ion collision experiments .",
    "since the subject of the energy loss is of topical interest , it is the principal motivation of the present paper to quantitatively investigate the effect of microscopic fluctuations on the energy loss of a charged particle passing through an equilibrium , weakly  coupled magnetized plasma . in particular , our main objective is to study through the lr theory the effect of a strong magnetic field on the energy loss process arising due to the fluctuations in a plasma .",
    "the sequel is structured as follows .",
    "interactions of a gyrating projectile with target stochastic electric fields are investigated at length in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] .",
    "resulting energy loss rates are respectively explained in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] for a target plasma with no magnetic field and then with an infinite one as well as in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] for a finite magnetic field and at low ",
    "velocity of the particle .",
    "the dielectric function approach was adopted earlier to calculate the energy loss of charged particles due to polarization effects of the medium @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that the energy lost by the particle is small compared to the energy of the particle itself so that the change in the velocity of the particle during the motion may be neglected , i.e , the particle moves in a straight - line ( in @xmath4 case ) or helical ( in @xmath5 case ) trajectory .",
    "we consider a nonrelativistic projectile particle with charge @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the electron charge ) and with a velocity @xmath8 , which moves in a magnetized classical plasma with a constant magnetic field @xmath0 .",
    "we ignore any role of the electron spin or magnetic moment due to the nonrelativistic motion of the particle and the plasma electrons .",
    "the energy loss of a particle is determined by the work of the retarding forces acting on the particle in the plasma from the electric field generated by the particle itself while moving .",
    "so the energy loss of the particle per unit time , i.e. energy loss rate ( elr ) , is given by @xcite @xmath9where the electric field is taken at the location @xmath10 of the test particle .",
    "within linear response theory the correlation function of the fluctuations of charge and current densities and the electromagnetic fields in the medium with space - time dispersion are completely determined in terms of the dielectric tensor of the medium .",
    "the total electric field @xmath11 induced in the plasma can be related to the external charge of the test particle by solving poisson s equation ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath12here @xmath13 is the longitudinal dielectric function and @xmath14 is the dielectric tensor of the plasma , respectively .    the previous formula for the energy loss in eq .",
    "does not take into account the fluctuations of the electric fields in the plasma and the particle recoil in interactions . to accommodate these effects",
    "it is necessary to replace eq .",
    "with @xcite , @xmath15where @xmath16 denotes the statistical averaging operation .",
    "it is to be noted that here two averaging procedures are performed : ( i ) an ensemble average with respect to the equilibrium distribution function and ( ii ) a time average over random fluctuations in plasma .",
    "these two operations are commuting and only after both of them are performed the average quantity takes up a smooth value @xcite . in the following , we will explicitly denote the ensemble average by @xmath17 wherever required to avoid possible confusion .",
    "the electric field @xmath18 in eq .",
    "consists of the induced field @xmath11 given by eq .   and a spontaneously generated microscopic field @xmath19 , the latter being a random function of position and time .",
    "the classical equation of motion of the particle with charge @xmath6 and mass @xmath20 moving in the fluctuating electric field @xmath21 and a uniform magnetic field @xmath0 have the form @xmath22 + \\frac{ze}{m}\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{e}}\\left ( \\mathbf{% r}(t),t\\right ) , \\label{eq:4}\\]]where @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the cyclotron frequency of the test particle , @xmath25 is the unit vector along the ( external ) magnetic field , @xmath26 is the total electric field involved in eq .  , @xmath10 is the coordinate of the particle .",

    "the mean change of the energy of the particle per unit time is given by eq .  .",
    "the stochastic time dependence as embodied in eq .   comes because of explicit fluctuations in time and motion of the particle from one field point to another .",
    "the dependence on the latter will be expanded about the free cyclotron motion where the former will be left untouched .",
    "this is done by taking a time interval @xmath44 sufficiently large with respect to the time scale of random electric field fluctuations in the plasma ( @xmath45 ) but small compared with the time during which the particle motion changes appreciably ( @xmath46 ) , @xmath47 .",

    "of course , in the present context of a magnetized plasma the time scales @xmath54 and @xmath55 may be strongly modified by the magnetic field , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "in fact in the coulomb logarithm determining the time @xmath54 , the debye length is replaced by the cyclotron radius  @xcite .",
    "this results in a logarithmic dependence on magnetic field in the relaxation time @xmath54 . on the other hand , at strong magnetic fields",
    "@xmath55 is replaced by the cyclotron period @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the cyclotron frequency of the electrons .",
    "thus , independently of the strength of the magnetic field and in the weak coupling limit with @xmath58 , these scales are widely separated . in eqs .   and keeping only the leading order terms in the expansion we obtain @xmath59@xmath60where @xmath61 and @xmath62 is determined by eq .  .",

    "assuming an equilibrated and homogeneous magnetized plasma when the power spectrum of the fluctuations is derived from the fluctuation  dissipation theorem and is expressed via longitudinal dielectric function of the medium we have considered two somewhat distinct cases with vanishing and with extremely strong magnetic field . at vanishing magnetic field the electric field fluctuations lead to an energy gain of the charged particle for all velocities .",
    "physically , this is arisen due to the energy absorption by projectile particle from thermal fluctuations .",
