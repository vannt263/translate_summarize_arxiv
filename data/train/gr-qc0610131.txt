    "it is well known within the framework of black - hole perturbation theory  @xcite that quasi - normal modes ( qnms ) ( i.e. , exponentially damped harmonic oscillations ) dominate the gravitational - wave response of a non - spherically distorted black hole if the corresponding frequencies are part of the fourier spectrum of the external source that moved the hole away from its equilibrium state .",
    "this perturbation is then radiated away in form of gravitational radiation until the black hole returns to its unperturbed , quiescent state . in practice ,",
    "the qnms excitation is triggered if the frequency of the perturbing agent ( e.g. an external matter source moving close to the black hole ) is sufficiently close to the fundamental frequencies of the black hole , which then acts as an excited oscillator . as a result , the qnms and in particular the fundamental mode ( which is the one at the highest frequency and with the smallest damping time ) represent the main feature of the gravitational waves emission only for a sufficiently compact perturbation ; i.e.",
    ", for sources whose characteristic scale is comparable with the width of the peak of the potential .",
    "these results are well - known since the early studies of press  @xcite ( see also vishveshwara  @xcite ) , who considered the scattering of gaussian gravitational - wave packets off a schwarzschild black hole and noticed that the excitation of the qnms of the black hole is more efficient for very narrow packets .",
    "approximate relations to compute the efficiency of excitation of the various qnms were introduced by leaver  @xcite and by andersson  @xcite for gaussian pulses initial data with variable width .",
    "since the qnms spectrum is entirely determined by the black hole properties ( i.e. , mass , spin and charge ) , it is expected that the detection of the qnms ringdown would provide a unique opportunity to unveil the physical properties of a black hole .",
    "for this reason , the excitation of black hole qnms have been studied in various astrophysical scenarios , such as the gravitational collapse of a ( rotating ) neutron star to a black hole or the collision of two black holes .",
    "the presence of the qnms in these situations has been confirmed either through the use of perturbation theory with various degrees of sophistication  @xcite , or through fully relativistic numerical simulations  @xcite .",
    "however , under more general and realistic conditions , such as the excitation of the qnms by accretion of matter , and that may be encountered in gravitational stellar collapse or binary neutron star mergers , the gravitational - wave response of a black hole can be more complex .",
    "for instance , the simulations performed by  @xcite showed that the gravitational - wave signal is not simply given by the superposition of exponentially - damped sinusoids at the qnms frequencies and that , in some cases , the qnm ringing is only weakly excited and analysis in the frequency domain are needed  @xcite . on the other hand , `` backscattering '' effects related to the slowly - decaying features of the scattering potential and interference effects turn out to play a crucial role for the correct interpretation of the results ; a detailed discussion of these effects can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the case of a schwarzschild black hole of mass @xmath0 ,",
    "we recall that the appearance of qnms ringing is related to the peak of the curvature potential ( also referred to as the zerilli or regge - wheeler potential ) , that is located at @xmath1 ; the backscattering , on the other hand , is related to the fact that the curvature potential decays as @xmath2 for @xmath3 .",
    "this behavior is responsible for the late time power - law tail @xmath4 of the gravitational - wave signal , where @xmath5 refers to the radiation multipole .",
    "therefore , while early - time ringing is the result of a superposition of exponentially damped sinusoids , and is dominated by the fundamental quasi - normal mode , at later times the ringing dies out and the signal is dominated by tail effects . however , in the transition from the `` ringdown '' to the `` tail '' phase , additional oscillations appear that can not be attributed to any of the two regimes and that also seem to depend on the choice of the initial data ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "as we shall show in this paper for a broad sample of initial data , there could be intermediate regimes where the `` ringdown '' and the `` tail '' terms of the potential produce competing effects , so that the qnms ringing and the backscattering effects can overlap , generating complex waveforms .",
    "these effects were first noticed in refs .",
    "@xcite , although not discussed in detail there .    in a recent paper  @xcite ,",
    "hereafter paper i , a general analysis of the gravitational radiation emitted as a result of anisotropic accretion of matter shells onto nonrotating black holes and neutron stars was presented .",
    "that investigation made use of a procedure that combines the solution of the linearized einstein equations for the metric perturbations with fully nonlinear hydrodynamics simulations .",
    "although the study of black hole perturbations produced by infalling matter has a long history and rich literature  @xcite , the approach outlined in paper i proved to be useful for a number of reasons : _",
    "i ) _ it provided additional information on the black - hole s response to the dynamics of point - like particles in the vicinity of black holes ; _ ii ) _ it helped understanding the basic black - hole s response to extended matter perturbations ; _ iii ) _ it represented an effective way of studying black - hole physics in a linear regime without having to resort to full - scale numerical relativity simulations .",
    "one of the main results of paper i was that , in the idealized accretion processes considered , most of the energy is released at frequencies lower than that of the fundamental quasi - normal mode ( qnm ) of the black hole , the spectrum consisting of a complex pattern , mostly produced during the accretion process rather than in the ringdown phase .",
    "more precisely , the gravitational - wave emission was found to be dominated by a collection of interference `` fringes '' at frequencies of about a few hundred hz , rather than by a single monochromatic peak at the ( higher ) frequency of the fundamental mode of the black hole .",
    "moreover , the width of these fringes was found to decrease rapidly with the initial position of the matter source .",
    "these results , which were already observed in other works  @xcite in the case of a point - like particle falling onto a schwarzschild black hole , also showed that the appearance of interference fringes in the energy spectra is much larger when the accreting matter is a shell of finite size and that the efficiency in gravitational - wave emission is much reduced , becoming almost two orders of magnitude smaller than in the case of point - like particles . an important feature of the calculations carried out in paper i was the minimization of the initial gravitational - wave content ; this turned out to be crucial to illustrate that the interference pattern was mainly due to the finite radial extension of the accreting source .",
    "the aim of the present paper is twofold .",
    "firstly , we intend to complete the discussion started in paper i on accreting quadrupolar shells onto a schwarzschild black hole by extending the parameter space of the initial models and by analyzing their impact on the gravitational - wave emission .",
    "in particular we study how the energy emitted in gravitational waves , and the corresponding spectra , depend on the compactness of the shells as well as on their initial locations . in doing so",
    "we show that , for a finite - size source , the ringing of the black hole is much more complex than a simple superposition of qnms and that the energy spectra ( and in particular the interference fringes ) are dependent on the choice of the initial data .    secondly , we improve the astrophysical relevance of our study by analyzing the gravitational radiation produced by thick accretion disks  @xcite which accrete onto the black hole on dynamical timescales .",
    "we recall , in fact , that quasi - periodic oscillations of thick accretion disks ( or tori ) orbiting around schwarzschild or kerr black holes have been recently addressed as promising sources of gravitational waves  @xcite in the khz range .",

    "specifying suitable initial data for nonspherical metric perturbations taking place in astrophysical events is not trivial . the standard approach , in the case of even - parity perturbations , exploits the fact that @xmath21 can be written in terms of two gauge - invariant multipoles , namely the perturbed conformal factor @xmath27 and the gravitational - wave degree of freedom @xmath28 as introduced , for instance , in eq .",

    "in the first case , if the hamiltonian constraint is satisfied , the momentum constraint is automatically satisfied too . in the second case , on the other hand , the momentum constraint must also be solved for @xmath29 if we provide a suitable ansatz for @xmath39 .    whether it is possible to use time - symmetric initial data depends essentially on the astrophysical scenario under investigation and thus on the form of the stress - energy tensor of the matter , whose multipoles appear as sources in the hamiltonian and momentum constraint equations . clearly , time - symmetry is satisfied for matter configurations in equilibrium , or initially at rest and subsequently falling radially ; in this case only the numerical solution of the hamiltonian constraint is needed .",
    "this is the case , for example , of dust shells initially at rest at a finite radius .",
    "because this configuration is intrinsically non time symmetric , it will invevitably produce spurious radiation . a way to minimize",

    "while the less damped modes are related to the interaction of the perturbations with the peak of the black hole regge - wheeler potential , the tail - effect can not be associated to qnms and are instead due to the long - range features of the potential and in particular to its slow decay with radius .      +      in order to single out the contribution of the peak of the curvature potential on the generation of the resulting gravitational - wave spectrum , while suppressing the effect of the tail term , we solve a simplified version of eq .",

    "this is necessary because the scattering of the pulse starts earlier for the regge - wheeler potential than for the pschl - teller one .",

    "since the pschl - teller potential decays exponentially , no tail effects are found and the signal is still given by a superposition of exponentially damped harmonic oscillations .",
    "smaller differences between the waveforms are however present also in the early part of the waveform ( cf . ,",
    "the inset of the top right panel of fig .  [ fig_2 ] ) and are , again , due to the fact that the interaction of the perturbation with the regge - wheeler potential starts `` earlier '' ( i.e. , at larger radii ) than in the case of the pschl - teller potential .",

    "[ fig_2 ] refer instead to a wave - packet that is initially closer to the black hole ( i.e. , @xmath85 ) and show the impact on the waveforms of an increasing width of the wave - packet .",
    "most notably , the two panels show that as @xmath79 is progressively increased , the effects due to the slow - decay of the regge - wheeler potential become progressively more pronounced , with the ringdown lasting progressively less and with the backscattering being correspondingly anticipated .",
    "for example , when @xmath86 ( left - bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] ) and despite the fundamental mode is still recognizable , other oscillations are present already after @xmath87 , while for @xmath88 ( right - bottom panel ) the global waveform is essentially overwhelmed by backscattering , the qnms are almost absent and the signal is dominated by the `` tail '' .",
    "an additional increase in the pulse width would make the qnms disappear completely . clearly , this behavior is not present in the case of a scattering off a pschl - teller potential , which is much less sensitive to the finite - size of the perturbation as long as it is smaller than the scale - height set by the exponential decay .",
    "although just a toy - problem , this simple comparison of the black - hole response when modeled with the pschl - teller potential is very useful to clarify that in the case of general initial data with a finite size , the shape of the curvature potential strongly affects the gravitational waveform . in the next sections we will refine this finding by considering more realistic perturbations such as those produced by the accretion of extended distributions of matter .      following the analysis presented in paper i",

    "it is interesting to note that with the exception of very wide shells ( i.e. , with @xmath126 ) which are not able to excite cleanly the qnms , the maximum of the spectra always lies between the two lines , suggesting the presence of the two modes in the waveform .",

    "firstly , as the infalling time is increased , the ringdown phase is progressively dominated by the non - oscillatory tail , essentially as a result of the `` spreading '' of the shell induced by the tidal field .",

    "@xcite and which pointed out that the excitation of the black hole qnms through a continuous flux of infalling particles is made difficult by the presence of destructive interferences effects .",
    "secondly , the efficiency in gravitational - wave emission decreases for shells falling from larger distances and is significantly smaller than for point - like particles .",
    "this can be easily appreciated in the right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , when comparing energy spectra associated with shells ( solid lines ) with the corresponding @xmath70 energy spectra of a particle plunging radially from the same initial position ( dashed line ) .",
    "note that the efficiency is in this case of at least a couple of orders of magnitude larger ( the data have been properly rescaled to aid the comparison ) .",
    "thirdly , the energy emission is progressively peaked toward lower frequencies as @xmath90 increases .",

    "furthermore , the gravitational - wave signal shows oscillations that reflect the excitation of the black hole qnms ( especially the fundamental one ) but these oscillations are in general so weak that the non - oscillatory tail determined by the long - range properties of the scattering potential soon dominates the signal .",
    "a phenomenology complementary to the one discussed in the previous section for a hypercritical accretion can be studied when the accretion takes place in a quasi - period fashion .",
    "indeed , there are at least two different ways of triggering a quasi - periodic accretion and we will discuss them separately .    the first possibility has already been discussed in sect .  [ tori ] and consists in adding a perturbation in the radial velocity of the torus parameterized in terms of an analytic accretion solution . as a concrete example we will now concentrate on the dynamics of model @xmath178 , describing a disk with a comparatively high value of the specific angular momentum , @xmath179 , and subject to an initial radial velocity perturbation with @xmath180 .",
    "figure  [ figv_5 ] shows the motion of the center of mass on the equatorial plane , indicating that after an initial transient , a phase of quasi - periodic , ( almost ) constant amplitude oscillations follows , in which the disk periodically approaches the black hole before the centrifugal barrier pushes it back , past its original position . as the torus nears the black hole , part of its matter",
    "is spilled through the cusp , resulting in a quasi - periodic accretion of matter onto the black hole ; this is shown by the inset of fig .",

    "the waveforms show a small burst at @xmath182 , that corresponds to the initial accretion of matter , followed by regular oscillations that mirror the motion of the torus in the potential well .",
    "some differences between the gauge - invariant and the sqf@xmath60 waveforms are recognizable in the initial stages , with the first one showing highly damped high - frequency oscillations for @xmath183 superposed to the main , quasi - periodic signal . since this high - frequency pattern is absent in the quadrupole waveform , we conclude that it originates from curvature backscattering of gravitational waves emitted in the initial infalling phase .",
    "we also note that the differences between the waveforms computed through the gauge - invariant formalism and the quadrupole formula using the quadrupole tensor defined by eq .",
    "( [ sqf1 ] ) become larger if the initial velocity perturbation is increased .",
    "this is simply due to the fact that the sqf@xmath60 is valid in the weak - field and slow - motion approximation and thus ceases to be accurate when the dynamics of the oscillations is nonlinear , with the velocities becoming relativistic .",
    "on the other hand , the velocity - dependent terms in the source function of the zerilli - moncrief equation are obviously accurate also in a relativistic regime .",
    "the energy spectrum for this signal is shown as a solid line in the right panel of fig .",

    "@xcite for a detailed discussion of the eigenfrequencies and their astrophysical implications ) .",
    "such peaks are present in both the @xmath142 and @xmath186 energy spectra ( dashed line in fig .",

    "the latter is generated by a waveform @xmath187 whose amplitude is roughly two orders of magnitude smaller than the @xmath142 one .",
    "it is interesting to note that while for the @xmath142 multipole the first frequency of the disk is the dominant one , the second frequency has the largest power for the @xmath186 multipole .",

    "this is in contrast with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , which have simulated a similar source of perturbations for the black hole and have indeed found a minute high - frequency contribution in the energy spectra related to the emission from the black hole .",
    "it is presently unclear what is the origin of this difference , but it is likely that the hybrid approach proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and which combines a solution in the time - domain for the hydrodynamics and one in the frequency - domain for the perturbative equations , is better suited to extract the extremely small contributions coming from the black hole .",
    "a second possibility of triggering quasi - periodic oscillations in the disk , and hence a quasi - periodic accretion , is by an instantaneous reduction of the specific angular momentum .",
    "the main difference with the dynamics discussed before is that this reduction produces a continuous mass accretion , which is however modulated quasi - periodically as the torus approaches or moves away from the black hole .",
    "this behavior is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] for model @xmath189 , in which the specific angular momentum is reduced from @xmath179 to @xmath190 .",
    "more specifically , the left panel of fig .  [ fig13 ] shows the motion of the center of mass on the equatorial plane and the evolution of the mass - accretion rate in the inset . because of the intrinsic reduction of the centrifugal support and the resulting continuous accretion , the oscillations are quasi - periodic in time but with decaying amplitude , so that by @xmath191 they have essentially disappeared and the torus accretes at an almost constant rate , with the center of mass progressively approaching the black hole .",
    "this different quasi - periodic dynamics of the torus is also imprinted onto the quadrupolar waveform and this is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] , which presents both the gauge - invariant signal as measured by an observer located at @xmath181 ( solid line ) and the one computed with the sqf@xmath192 ( dashed line ) .",
    "note that the differences between the signals are very small initially , but they grow with time and by @xmath193 , when the angular momentum loss induces a global radial motion of the disk , the mean value of the gauge - invariant signal progressively drifts away from zero .",
    "this different behavior can be understood simply if one bears in mind that during this stage the disk is undergoing an almost steady - accretion phase . as a result , while the disks mass - quadrupole is nonzero and large , its time variations , and hence the corresponding gravitational - wave signal as computed in the sqf@xmath60 , are essentially zero .",
    "the perturbative approach , on the other hand , is able to capture the perturbations induced by this steady - state accretion and this is reflected in the gradual and secular increase of the gravitational - wave signal shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] . of course",
    ", this behavior is the same already encountered in the case of accretion of dust shells and it is , once again , generated by curvature backscattering off the `` tail '' of the potential .",
    "note that during the final stages of the accretion , i.e. , for @xmath194 , the motion of the center of mass exhibits an exponentially rapid motion toward the black hole which , however , is not reflected neither in the mass - accretion rate , nor in the gravitational - wave signal .",
    "the reason for this is that , in practice , the rest - mass contained in the torus in these final stages is extremely small and the rest - mass density is so diluted that it becomes comparable to that of the atmosphere surrounding the torus . as a result ,",
    "the effective perturbation induced onto the black hole in the final stages of the accretion is vanishingly small .    in summary",
    ", the analysis of this process shows that the gravitational - wave signal produced by a quasi - periodic accretion can be rather different , depending on whether the amplitude of the oscillations is ( almost ) constant in time and the accretion rate is also periodic , or the oscillations have decreasing amplitude and the accretion rate is constant with a periodic modulation . in the first case",
    ", the gravitational - wave signal will reflect faithfully the dynamics of the matter with constant - amplitude waveforms averaging to zero and a spectrum showing peaks at the eigenfrequencies of the oscillating matter . in the second case ,",
    "on the other hand , the waveforms will have a decreasing amplitude and will not average to zero as a result of the underlying continuous accretion .",
    "by performing numerical simulations that combine the solution of the nonlinear hydrodynamics equations with that of the linear inhomogeneous zerilli - moncrief and regge - wheeler equations , we have studied the features of the gravitational - wave signals generated by the accretion of matter onto a schwarzschild black hole .    as extended and",
    "accreting matter - sources we have considered quadrupolar shells of dust falling radially from a finite distance , as well as geometrically thick disks undergoing either bursts of hypercritical accretion or quasi - periodic oscillations . in both cases we find that the gravitational - wave signal _ is not _ a simple superposition of the black hole qnms and that the latter can not be found in the energy spectra at times .",
    "rather , we find that quite generically the signal contains important contributions coming from radiation scattering off the tail of the curvature potential and producing a characteristic pattern of interference fringes in the energy spectra .",
    "while the relevance of this contribution differs according to the specific source considered , it is generically present as long as the source of perturbations is extended and the scattering potential does not have an exponential decay with radius .",
    "this conclusion , which was already reported in previous studies involving simpler sources , has been here confirmed unambiguously by studying the scattering off a fictitious potential , the pschl - teller potential , which however decays exponentially with radius .",
    "these generic properties of the gravitational - wave emission coming from black holes perturbed by extended sources represent important differences with respect to corresponding properties of signals produced by very compact sources , such as point - like particles .",
    "of course this conclusion prevents from the derivation of a simple and generic description of the gravitational - wave signal which would be independent of the properties of the perturbing source , but it also opens the exciting perspective of deducing many of the physical properties of the source through a careful analysis of the waveforms produced .",
    "overall , the results presented here make us confident that the black hole qnm contributions to the full gravitational - wave signal should be extremely small in generic astrophysical scenarios involving the accretion of extended distributions of matter . on the other hand",
    ", it should also be stressed that the time - domain analysis carried out here may not be the most accurate to extract the contributions coming from the perturbed black hole when these are several orders of magnitude smaller than those coming from the source itself or from the backscattering off the potential . in these cases , however , a hybrid approach such as the one proposed in ref .",

    "<S> by combining the numerical solution of the nonlinear hydrodynamics equations with the solution of the linear inhomogeneous zerilli - moncrief and regge - wheeler equations we investigate the properties of the gravitational radiation emitted during the axisymmetric accretion of matter onto a schwarzschild black hole . </S>",
    "<S> the matter models considered include quadrupolar dust shells and thick accretion disks , permitting us to simulate situations which may be encountered at the end stages of stellar gravitational collapse or binary neutron star merger . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the interference pattern appearing in the energy spectra of the emitted gravitational waves and on the amount of excitation of the quasi - normal modes of the accreting black hole . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , quite generically in the presence of accretion , the black hole ringdown is not a simple superposition of quasi - normal modes , although the fundamental mode is usually present and often dominates the gravitational - wave signal . we interpret this as due to backscattering of waves off the non - exponentially decaying part of the black hole potential and to the finite spatial extension of the accreting matter . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that the black hole qnm contributions to the full gravitational wave signal should be extremely small and possibly not detectable in generic astrophysical scenarios involving the accretion of extended distributions of matter . </S>"
