    "<S> the @xmath7c excited states decaying into @xmath2+@xmath3be(gs ) are observed between 8.5 and 13.5 mev . the @xmath2+@xmath3li(gs ) , @xmath2+@xmath3li*(4.652 mev ) and t+@xmath8be(gs ) decays of @xmath7b excited states between 9 and 19 mev are observed . </S>",
    "<S> the decay processes are used to indicate the possible three - centre 2@xmath2+@xmath9he ( 2@xmath2+@xmath9h ) cluster structure of observed states . </S>",
    "<S> this cluster structure is more prominent in the positive - parity states , where two rotational bands with large deformations are suggested . </S>",
    "<S> excitations of some of the observed t=1/2 resonances coincide with the energies of previously measured t=3/2 isobaric analogs of the @xmath7be states , indicating that these states may have mixed isospin .    </S>",
    "<S> many light nuclei possess well developed cluster structure made of @xmath2-particles as main building block . </S>",
    "<S> the best known examples are 2@xmath2 and 3@xmath2 cluster structures of @xmath8be and @xmath10c . in recent years attention </S>",
    "<S> has been focused on neutron - rich be and c nuclei , where evidence for developed cluster structures was found ( for example @xcite and references therein ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to investigate influence of @xmath2-clustering on structure of the neutron deficient @xmath7c nucleus and its mirror nucleus @xmath7b for which the experimental evidence for cluster structures is scarce . </S>",
    "<S> here we present results of the experimental studies which probe cluster structure of @xmath7c and @xmath7b via the @xmath2-decay of their excited states and for @xmath7b also via 2@xmath2+t decay .    </S>",
    "<S> = 0.8    the measurements were performed at the australian national university s 14ud tandem accelerator facility . </S>",
    "<S> 70 mev and 55 mev @xmath11be beam were incident on a thin li@xmath12o@xmath13 foil . </S>",
    "<S> reaction products were detected in an array of four charged - particle telescopes which provided charge and mass resolution up to be . </S>",
    "<S> telescopes 1 and 2 were located with their centres at @xmath1417.5@xmath15 from the beam axis and telescopes 3 and 4 at @xmath1429@xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement of the energies and angles of detected particles permitted the kinematics of the many - body reactions to be fully reconstructed . </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath2-decay of excited states in @xmath7b has been studied using the @xmath3li(@xmath1be,@xmath7b * @xmath16 @xmath2+@xmath3li)@xmath5he reaction ( q=-2.4 mev ) . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath7b excitation energy spectra show resonances at 9.2 , 10.3 , 10.55 , 11.2 , ( 11.4 ) , 11.8 , 12.5 , ( 13.0 ) , 13.1 , ( 14.0 ) , 14.35 , ( 17.4 ) and ( 18.6 ) mev . </S>",
    "<S> a study of the @xmath2-decay of @xmath7c excited states has been performed using the @xmath0o(@xmath1be,@xmath7c * @xmath16 @xmath2+@xmath3be)@xmath4c reaction ( q=-14.602 mev ) . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath7c excitation energy spectra provide evidence for peaks at 8.65 , 9.85 , 10.7 and 12.1 mev and indications for peaks at 12.6 and 13.4 mev . </S>",
    "<S> detailed description and discussion of the results are presented in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of these data shows that main reaction mechanism for the population of the @xmath2-decaying states in both nuclei was two - nucleon transfer onto the cluster nucleus @xmath1be . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ 11c11b ] presents comparison of the @xmath7b and @xmath7c excitation energy spectra from these measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we observe the same series of excited states at the lower excitations in both nuclei : unresolved doublet of 7/2@xmath17 , 5/2@xmath17 states ( marked a ) , a 3/2@xmath18 , 5/2@xmath18 , 7/2@xmath17 triplet ( b ) which is @xmath141.2 mev above the doublet , 9/2@xmath17 state ( c ) at an excitation of 2 mev higher than the doublet , then the state which is believed to be the isobaric analogue state of the @xmath7be ground state ( d ) which is @xmath143.4 mev above the doublet , and then weak states , which are probably 7/2@xmath17 ( e ) and 11/2@xmath17 ( f ) , and which are 3.9 and 4.8 mev above the doublet s excitation . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting feature of these results is the observation of the @xmath2-decay , which means isospin t=1/2 , of the excited states proposed to be the isobaric analogue states of the @xmath7be states , which have t=3/2 , in both nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> if the observed states are indeed those identified with t=3/2 character , then our results show that the lowest three t=3/2 levels in @xmath7b and the first t=3/2 level in @xmath7c probably have large isospin mixing . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , the peaks may have a genuine t=1/2 character and may be linked to rotational bands . </S>",
    "<S> the present results show that six observed states in @xmath7b and six in @xmath7c can be grouped in two rotational bands @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> rotational bands with k=5/2@xmath17 have been proposed beginning at 7.286 and 6.905 mev in @xmath7b and @xmath7c respectively , with rotational members at 9.185 and 8.655 ( 7/2@xmath17 ) , 11.265 and 10.679 ( 9/2@xmath17 ) and 14.04 and 13.4 mev ( 11/2@xmath17 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the moment of inertia i of these bands is very large , with a rotational parameter @xmath19/2i of 0.25 mev which would correspond to very deformed structure . </S>",
    "<S> other possible positive - parity bands in both @xmath7b and @xmath7c have been proposed with k=3/2@xmath17 , beginning at excitation energies 7.97784 and 7.4997 mev , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> rotational members are at 9.274 and 8.699 mev ( 5/2@xmath17 ) and 10.597 and 10.083 mev ( 7/2@xmath17 ) and the 9/2@xmath17 members of these bands would be at 12.6 mev in @xmath7b and 12.1 mev in @xmath7c , very close to the excitations of the proposed 1/2@xmath17 t=3/2 states and exactly at excitations where resonances are in the present spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the rotational parameter @xmath19/2i of these two bands would be 0.215 mev .    </S>",
    "<S> triple coincidence data provide clear evidence for the @xmath3li(@xmath1be,@xmath2@xmath2t)@xmath5he reaction ( q=-4.9 mev ) at both e@xmath6=70 and 55 mev @xcite . reconstructed relative energy spectra for all possible combinations of 2 and 3 particles in the exit channel </S>",
    "<S> provide evidence for decays of @xmath7b excited states into 2@xmath2+t , the @xmath8be ground state and the first excited state into 2@xmath2 and for @xmath2+t decay of @xmath3li states at 4.652 and 6.6 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath7b excitation energy spectra reconstructed from the energies and momenta of all three detected decay products presented in figure [ aat ] show peaks at 13.1 , 14.4 and 17.5 mev . </S>",
    "<S> all three states are also observed in the @xmath2+@xmath3li data . </S>",
    "<S> an analysis gives evidence for the t+@xmath8be(gs ) decay of the @xmath7b states at 13.1 and 14.4 mev and decays via @xmath8be(3.03 mev ) and @xmath3li(4.652 mev ) states of the 14.4 and 17.5 mev states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these results are the first direct evidence for decay of @xmath7b excited states into these three - body channels .    </S>",
    "<S> given the nature of the reaction processes , two - nucleon transfer onto the 2@xmath2+n nucleus @xmath1be , the observed strong @xmath2-decay of these mirror states at excitations where various decay channels are open and known @xmath2+t(@xmath9he ) structure of @xmath3li(@xmath3be ) , as well as observed decays of @xmath7b states into 2@xmath2+t , it is possible that these states possess the three - centre 2@xmath2+t(@xmath9he ) cluster structure . </S>",
    "<S> these two nuclei may be an example of the three - centre structure in which holes , rather than nucleons , are being exchanged between @xmath2-cores . </S>",
    "<S> the present measurements did not provide information on the spin and parity of the observed states , which are unknown for some of the states , and also on partial widths , which are crucial for the understanding of their structure . </S>",
    "<S> additional measurements capable of determining this information will be performed in the near future . </S>"
