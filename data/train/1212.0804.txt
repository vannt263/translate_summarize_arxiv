    "computing drawings of planar graphs is an extensively studied subject . in its most classical",
    "setting , the problem is to design an algorithm that receives as input a planar graph @xmath5 and it produces as output a drawing of @xmath5 such that no two edges of the drawing cross .",
    "aesthetic requirements , such as minimizing the number of bends along the edges , using a small area , or representing the faces as convex or star - shaped polygons can be specified as additional optimization goals .",
    "in addition to these geometric optimization goals , a graph drawing algorithm can receive as input a set of semantic constraints which define placement and/or routing requirements for some of the vertices and/or some of the edges .",
    "for example , a subset of the vertices must be collinear , some of the edges must be horizontal , the size or shape of some edges or vertices is defined in advance ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "a well studied graph drawing problem with semantic constraints is the point set emebddability problem .",
    "given a planar graph @xmath5 with @xmath2 vertices and a set @xmath0 of @xmath2 distinct points in the plane , the problem is to compute a crossing - free drawing of @xmath5 such that its vertices are mapped to the points of @xmath0 .",
    "kaufmann and wiese  @xcite proved that any planar graph has a point - set embedding with at most two bends per edge on any given point set .",
    "the drawing may however use exponential area , and a polynomial area construction is showed in  @xcite .",
    "if no bends along the edges are allowed , cabello  @xcite proved that deciding whether a planar graph admits a straight - line point - set embedding is an np - complete problem .",
    "nishat et al .  @xcite and moosa and rahman  @xcite presented polynomial - time algorithms to test straight - line point - set embeddabiliity of plane 3-trees . at last year",
    "socg , biedl and vatshelle  @xcite showed that the problem can be solved in polynomial time for planar graphs with a fixed combinatorial embedding that have constant treewidth and constant face - degree .",
    "they also show that if one of the conditions is dropped ( i.e. , either the treewidth is unbounded or some faces have large degrees ) , the problem becomes np - hard .",
    "gritzman , mohar , pach and pollack  @xcite and independently castaeda and urrutia  @xcite proved that the outerplanar graphs with @xmath2 vertices are the largest family of graphs admitting a straight - line point - set embedding on any set of @xmath2 points in general position .    motivated by the above complexity results and restrictions on the classes of planar graphs that admit a geometric point - set embedding , we study the problem of drawing a planar graph with specified vertex locations from a different angle .",
    "namely , we consider a scenario in which the given locations are fewer than the vertices of the graph . in our setting the algorithm receives as input any planar graph @xmath5 with @xmath2 vertices and any `` sufficiently small '' set @xmath0 of points .",
    "the output is a crossing - free straight - line drawing such that @xmath6 vertices of @xmath5 are mapped to the points of @xmath0 , while the points representing the remaining @xmath7 vertices of @xmath5 are chosen by the algorithm .",
    "we call the output a _ geometric point - subset embedding of @xmath5 on @xmath0_. we stress that @xmath0 can be any set of points , i.e. the drawing algorithm must work for all point sets of `` sufficiently small '' cardinality .",
    "we are interested in making the `` sufficiently small '' cardinality as large as possible .",
    "for example , it is immediate to see that all planar graphs with at least four vertices have a geometric point - subset embedding of @xmath5 on all point sets of cardinality three .",
    "less intuitively , it has been proven in  @xcite that all planar graphs with at least six vertices have a geometric point - subset embedding of @xmath5 on all point sets of cardinality four .",
    "the following significantly improves this cardinality .",
    "[ th : general ] let @xmath5 be an @xmath2-vertex plane graph with vertices and let @xmath0 be a set of distinct points in the plane such that @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath5 has a geometric point - subset embedding on @xmath0 , which can be computed @xmath4 time .",
    "we also prove that if the points are in one - sided convex position ( i.e. they form a convex point set such that the leftmost and the rightmost points are adjacent in the convex hull ) , the bound on the cardinality in theorem  [ th : general ] can be further increased .",

    "we recall that in  @xcite it is proven that there exists a one - sided convex point set @xmath0 of size @xmath10 such that any planar graphs admits a geometric point - subset embedding on @xmath0 .",

    "the existence of these subgraphs will be proven in theorems  [ th : large - induced - outerpath ] and [ th : large - induced - outerplanar ] , where it is also showed how to compute them in @xmath4 time .",
    "the arguments combine a variety of concepts , including schnyder s realizers  @xcite , rectangular representations  @xcite , stabbing techniques  @xcite , 4-block trees  @xcite , and mirsky s theorem  @xcite .",
    "as for steps  3 and  4 , they rely on different drawing techniques concerning point - set embeddings and straight - line drawings of plane graphs inside star - shaped polygons  @xcite .",
    "we conclude this introduction by remarking that theorems  [ th : large - induced - outerpath ] and [ th : large - induced - outerplanar ] may be of independent interest .",
    "namely , proving the existence of large induced subgraphs has a long tradition in combinatorial graph theory .",
    "erds , saks , and ss  @xcite asked what is the maximum size of an induced tree in a graph and studied the relation between such size and other natural graph parameters .",
    "for example , they give upper and lower bounds on large induced trees in @xmath20-free graphs ; these bounds have been improved by matouek and mal  @xcite and by fox , loh , and sudakov  @xcite .",
    "restricting to paths , aroha and valencia  @xcite showed that every 3-connected planar graph with a large number of vertices has a long induced path .",
    "more specifically , they proved that if a @xmath21-connected graph @xmath5 has a vertex of degree @xmath22 , then @xmath5 contains an induced path of length at least @xmath23 . generalizing this result to non - planar graphs , bhme et al .",
    "@xcite proved that for every positive integers @xmath24 and @xmath25 there exists an integer @xmath26 such that every @xmath11-connected graph of order at least @xmath2 contains either an induced path of length @xmath25 or a subdivision of the complete bipartite graph @xmath27 .",
    "however , their construction , do not seem to yield neither an explicit function for the length of the path nor an algorithm to compute it .",
    "an implication of our results is that every @xmath2 vertex maximal planar graph has an induced path of length at least @xmath28 , which can be computed in @xmath4 time .",
