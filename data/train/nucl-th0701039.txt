    "an exhaustive analysis of the coupled dynamics of the scissors mode and the isovector giant quadrupole resonance in a model of harmonic oscillator with quadrupole ",
    "quadrupole residual interaction has been performed in @xcite .",
    "the wigner function moments ( wfm ) method was applied to derive the dynamical equations for angular momentum and quadrupole moment .",
    "analytical expressions for energies , @xmath0- and @xmath1-values , sum rules and flow patterns of both modes were found for arbitrary values of the deformation parameter .",
    "the subtle nature of the phenomenon and its peculiarities were clarified .    nevertheless , this description was not complete , because pairing was not taken into account .",
    "it is well known @xcite , that pairing is very important for the correct quantitative description of the scissors mode . moreover , its role is crucial for an explanation of the empirically observed deformation dependence of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the prediction of the scissors mode was inspired by the geometrical picture of a counterrotating oscillation of the deformed proton density against the deformed neutron density @xcite .",
    "thus , as it is seen from its physical nature , the scissors mode can be observed only in deformed nuclei .",
    "therefore , quite naturally , the question of the deformation dependence of its properties ( for example , energy @xmath2 and @xmath3 value ) arises .",
    "however , during the first years after its discovery in @xmath4gd @xcite `` nearly all experimental data were limited to nuclei of about the same deformation ( @xmath5 ) , and the important aspect of orbital @xmath6 strength dependence on @xmath7 has not yet been examined '' , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the first investigations of the @xmath7-dependence of @xmath2 and @xmath3 were performed by w. ziegler et al .",
    "@xcite , who have studied the chain of isotopes @xmath8sm , and by h. h. pitz et al .",
    "@xcite and j. margraf et al .",
    "@xcite , who have studied the chain of isotopes @xmath9nd .",
    "they found that the low - energy @xmath0 strength exhibits approximately a quadratic dependence on the deformation @xmath7 .",
    "shortly afterwards it was discovered @xcite , that in even - even nuclei the total low - energy magnetic dipole strength is closely related to the collective @xmath10 strength of the @xmath11 state and , thus , depends quadratically on the nuclear deformation parameter .",
    "later j. enders et al .",
    "@xcite made a theoretical analysis of experimental data on the scissors mode in nuclei with @xmath12 .",
    "investigating the sum rules @xmath13 and @xmath14 derived by e. lipparini and s. stringari @xcite , they found that the ratio @xmath15 is proportional to @xmath2 with very good accuracy : @xmath16 .",
    "they also observed that the moment of inertia @xmath17 of the ground state rotational band and the moment of inertia for the irrotational flow @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 is the rigid body moment if inertia ) differ by nearly a constant factor ( @xmath20 ) over the entire region .",
    "using this fact and identifying the giromagnetic ratio and the moment of inertia of the scissors mode with those of the ground state rotational band , they found with the help of the @xmath14 sum rule , that @xmath3 is proportional to @xmath21 .",
    "so , all the rather numerous experimental data demonstrate undoubtedly the @xmath21 dependence of @xmath3 and the very weak deformation dependence of @xmath2 . on the other hand , at the beginning of the nuclear scissors studies all theoretical models , starting from the first work by suzuki and rowe @xcite , predicted a linear @xmath7-dependence for both , @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "it turned out that the correct @xmath7-dependence is supplied by the pairing correlations .",
    "the effects of the pairing interaction in the description of the scissors mode were evaluated for the first time by bes and broglia @xcite .",
    "they assumed `` for simplicity that only the two subsets of levels which are closest to the fermi level ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) are affected by the pairing interactions '' . in this case",
    "@xmath0 should be multiplied by the factor @xmath24 @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is a single particle energy , @xmath29 is the gap and @xmath30 is the chemical potential .",
    "the value of @xmath31 was found by `` making use of the fact that the moment of inertia is approximately 1/2 of the rigid body value obtained in the absence of pairing '' .",
    "thus , in accordance with the inglis formula one has @xmath32/ [ 1/2e_{n_{\\perp}}]=(e_{n_{\\perp}}/e_{n_{\\perp}})^3 \\label{e / e}\\ ] ] and @xmath33=0.79 . as a result @xmath0 is reduced by the factor @xmath34 = 0.62 , i.e. the influence of pairing is quite remarkable .",
    "it was , however , noted by hamamoto and magnusson @xcite that this result holds only for well deformed nuclei , where the equality ( [ e / e ] ) is valid . in general",
    "it is necessary to take into account the @xmath7-dependence of the @xmath33 - factor .",
    "this was done for the first time in ref .",
    "the authors applied `` the method of averaging the position of the chemical potential between the occupied subshell @xmath35 and the empty shell @xmath36 '' to find that the @xmath7-dependence of @xmath0 is determined by the function @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",
    "in the small deformation limit this function is proportional to @xmath21 , while for large @xmath7 it deviates remarkably from such a simple dependence .",
    "the authors performed also a more realistic qrpa calculation for the woods - saxon potential with qq and @xmath39 residual interactions , which confirmed their simplified analytical estimate .",
    "in @xcite , n. pietralla et al . established the @xmath7-dependence of the @xmath33 - factor phenomenologically .",
    "they were first to perform the theoretical analysis of the experimental data of the scissors mode in nuclei in the mass region @xmath40 .",
    "following the idea of bes and broglia they parametrized the @xmath33 - factor as @xmath41 the free parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 were fixed by a fit to the experimental moments of inertia with the help of a formula equivalent to ( [ e / e ] ) @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the effective moment of inertia of the ground state band . in this way it was found that `` the centers of gravity of the observed @xmath6 strength distributions are always close to 3 mev '' , i.e. `` the data exhibit a weak dependence of the scissors mode on the deformation parameter '' . they also derived a semiempirical formula for the total @xmath6 strength of the scissors mode @xmath46 ( @xmath47 is the scaling factor of the giromagnetic ratio ) , which describes very well the experimental data and gives a deformation dependence `` practically indistinguishable from the @xmath21 dependence '' .    a direct way to demonstrate the @xmath7-dependence of the @xmath33 - factor",
    "was suggested in @xcite .",
    "e. garrido et al . have shown that it is possible to extract analytically the @xmath21 factor from the occupation coefficient @xmath48 using the definitions of the @xmath49 coefficients , it is easy to write @xmath50 as @xmath51 with @xmath52 = \\frac{e^2_{\\alpha\\beta}}{z}[1+\\frac{e^2_{\\alpha\\beta}e^2}{z^2}+ ... ] \\label{pab}\\ ] ] and @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "for the scissors mode @xmath55 .",
    "the function @xmath56 has a regular dependence on @xmath7 ( no poles ) , so the coefficient @xmath50 and , respectively , @xmath3 are obviously proportional to @xmath21 . for the ivgqr @xmath57 , but its @xmath0 is proportional to @xmath21 even without pairing due to other reasons ( see section 3 ) .    in this paper",
    "we generalize the wfm method to take into account pair correlations .",
    "this allows us to obtain the correct @xmath7-dependence for @xmath2 and @xmath3 in a slightly different way than in the papers , cited above .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 the moments of time dependent hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( tdhfb ) dynamical equations for normal and abnormal densities are calculated and adequate approximations are introduced to obtain the final set of six dynamical equations for the collective variables . in section 3",
    "these equations are decoupled in the isoscalar and isovector sets and the isovector excitation energies and transitions probabilities are calculated in the framework of the ho+qq model .",
    "the results of calculations are discussed in section 4 .",
    "concluding remarks are contained in section 5 .",

    "it is worth noting that contrary to the case without pairing @xcite the energy of the scissors mode does not go to zero for deformation @xmath177 however this does not mean any contradiction with the known quantum mechanical statement that the rotation of spherical nuclei is impossible .",
    "it is easy to see from ( [ int1iv ] ) that the relative angular momentum @xmath164 is conserved in this case , @xmath178 , so the nature of this mode of a spherical nucleus has nothing in common with the vibration of angular momentum .",
    "the calculation of transition probabilities ( see below ) shows that this mode can be excited by an electric field and it is not excited by a magnetic field .",
    "our estimation gives for the energy of this mode the value about 4 mev , that agrees very well with the result of m. matsuo et al @xcite , who studied the isovector quadrupole response of @xmath179sn in the framework of qrpa with skyrme forces and found the proper resonance at @xmath1804.2 mev .",
    "it is known @xcite that without pairing the scissors mode has a non zero value of an energy only due to the fermi surface deformation ( fsd ) .",

    "this result can be explained by our approximation @xmath190 .",
    "it is now a good place to discuss the deformation dependence of the energies and transition probabilities .",
    "first we recall the corresponding formulae without pairing : @xmath191 where the superscript `` 0''means the absence of pairing and we assumed @xmath155 .",
    "the scissors mode energy is proportional to @xmath7 , that becomes evident after expanding the square root : @xmath192 where @xmath193    at a first superficial glance , the transition probability , as given by formula ( [ m1sc ] ) , has the desired ( experimentally observed ) quadratic deformation dependence .",
    "however , due to the linear @xmath7-dependence of the factor @xmath2 in the denominator , the resulting @xmath7-dependence of @xmath194 turns out to be linear , too .",
    "the situation is changed radically when pairing is included . in this case",
    "the main contribution to the scissors mode energy comes from the pairing interaction ( the term @xmath195 in ( [ e2pm ] ) ) , @xmath2 is not proportional to @xmath7 and the deformation dependence of @xmath3 becomes quadratic in excellent agreement with qrpa calculations and experimental data @xcite .",
    "the deformation dependence of @xmath196 is quadratic in @xmath7 , even without pairing , because the energy @xmath197 is not proportional to @xmath7 and depends only weakly on it .",

    "we have reproduced all experimentally observed qualitative features of the scissors mode .",
    "we understand that our model is too simplified to describe also precise quantitative experimental characteristics .",
