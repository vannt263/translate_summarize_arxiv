    "currently , transiting extrasolar planets offer virtually exclusive opportunities for observing physical and chemical states of exoplanetary atmospheres . over the past four years",
    ", retrievals of atmospheric molecules from multicolor transit photometry ( i.e. transit spectra ) have compelled the development of progressively more sophisticated atmopheric models to interpret the observations and understand underlying chemical and dynamical processes . in particular",
    ", atmospheric - chemistry modeling is evolving from strictly thermo - equilibrium models with stationary chemical species , to coupled models ( zahnle et al .",
    "2009a , b ; line et al . 2010 ; moses et al 2011 ) incorporating thermo - kinetics , vertical transport , and photochemistry .",
    "thus far , such efforts have been devoted to hot - jupiter planets , especially hd 209458b and hd 189733b , due to their favorable transit depths and eclipse brightnesses and , therefore , far greater availability of observational data . however , with the recent retrieval of molecular abundances in the atmosphere of gj  436b ( stevenson et al .",
    "2010 ; madhusudhan & seager 2011 ) , exoplanetary science is venturing into a new territory : hot - neptune atmospheric chemistry .",
    "gj  436b is bound to serve as a prototypical planet anchoring the theoretical framework for understanding the hot - neptune class of exoplanets , much as how hd 209458b and hd 189733b have for hot jupiters .",
    "it is also the first planet with observable thermal emission that transits an m star .",
    "m stars are of particular interest since they constitute the majority of stars in the solar neighborhood , and they have close - in habitable zones , which enhances radial - velocity detectability and transit observability ; therefore , m stars present the best opportunities to discover and characterize rocky , potentially habitable exoplanets in the near future .",
    "gj  436b and gj  1214b provide the only present test cases for atmospheric chemistry of planets orbiting m dwarfs .",
    "therefore , an era of intensive investigations of this planet is commencing .",
    "this paper presents our application of a state - of - the - art model seamlessly integrating thermo - kinetics , vertical transport , and photochemistry to simulate the atmospheric chemistry of gj  436b in a similar manner to visscher et al .",

    "the first transiting hot neptune discovered ( butler et al .",
    "2004 , gillon et al .",
    "2007 ) , gj  436b , revolves around an m dwarf merely 10 pc away from earth and has received much attention due to its interesting orbital dynamics ( ribas et al .",
    "2008 , mardling 2008 , batygin et al .",
    "2009 ) , interior properties ( nettelmann et al . 2010 , kramm et al . 2011 ) , and atmospheric properties ( stevenson et al . 2010 , lewis et al . 2010 , madhusudhan & seager 2011 , shabram et al . 2011 ) . the slightly eccentric orbit ( eccentricity = 0.16 ) has a mean orbital radius of 0.0287 au ( torres et al .",
    "2008 ) , and the planet probably has a pseudo - synchronous rotation ( deming et al .",
    "the planet s mass is 23 @xmath2 , and its density of 1.7 g/@xmath3 resembles that of the ice - giant neptune ( 1.63 g/@xmath3 ) .",
    "analyses of its mass - radius relationship and transit depth indicates a layer of h / he dominated atmosphere is clearly required ( figueira et al .",
    "2009 ; nettelmann et al .",
    "2010 ; rogers & seager 2010 ) .",
    "the host star has an effective temperature of @xmath4  3400 k and an estimated age of 3  9 gyr ( torres et al .",
    "assuming zero albedo and global thermal re - distribution , the planet s effective temperature is 650 k. of the confirmed transiting exoplanets ( wright et al .",
    "2011 ) , gj  436b is one of the least irradiated and has one of the coolest atmospheres . therefore",
    ", this planet represents a significant departure from hot jupiters in terms of size , thermal environment , and uv flux .",
    "although gj 436b was discovered in 2004 ( butler , by radial velocity ) , it was not until 2010 that a retrieval of explicit molecular abundances in its atmosphere was reported ( stevenson et al .",
    "2010 ) , where six channels of secondary - eclipse photometry data ranging from 3.6 to 24 @xmath5 m were analyzed by generating @xmath4 10@xmath6 simulated spectra using varying combinations of molecular compositions and temperature profiles to find the best fit to observations . a more recent paper ( madhusudhan & seager 2011 )",
    "provides further details and updated results of a re - analysis of the same dataset using the same general retrieval method . in short , 10@xmath6 combinations of ten physio - chemical free parameters ,",
    "each spanning a large range of values , were used to generate synthetic dayside - emission spectra . in each of the 10@xmath6 scenarios , six of the ten parameters",
    "were used to define the temperature - pressure ( t - p ) profile , whereas the other four parameters specified vertically uniform abundances of four molecules : h@xmath7o , co , ch@xmath0 , and co@xmath7 .",
    "additionally , the 1-d atmospheric model restricted the ratio of emergent flux output to incident stellar flux input on the day side to within the range between zero and unity . given six data points and ten free paramters , the retrieval problem was mathematically underdetermined .",
    "nonetheless , sampling a million points in parameter - phase space allowed the authors to examine the joint probability contours , as defined by the goodness - of - fit ( chi - square ) function , projected on multiple - parameter spaces .",
    "furthermore , by placing physical - plausibility constraints ( in consideration of believable departures from thermo - equilibrium chemistry ) on the molecular abundances , the authors were able to confine the physical space to a fairly narrow , `` best - fit , '' range for chi - square @xmath8 3 .",
    "depending on the wavelength , the photospheric altitude varies from 9 bar to 0.2 bar levels .",
    "the main conclusions are as follows : 1 ) temperature inversion is ruled out ( i.e. no stratosphere ) ; 2 ) 6 ppm ( parts per million ) is the absolute upper limit for ch@xmath0 abundance ; 3 ) 300 ppm is the absolute upper limit for h@xmath7o abundance ; 4 ) co@xmath7 and co abundances are anti - correlated ; 5 ) taking physical - plausibility into consideration , the best - fit spectrum represents @xmath9 = 100 ppm , @xmath10 = 1 ppm , @xmath11 = 7000 ppm , and @xmath12 = 6 ppm , where @xmath13 is the number density of molecule @xmath14 divided by that of h@xmath7 .",
    "also , note that even in the best - fit scenario , @xmath15 can range anywhere from 1  100 ppm .",
    "the stevenson et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and the madhusudhan & seager ( 2011 ) efforts are the most comprehensive studies of atmospheric composition on gj  436b thus far .    from a theoretical point of view , the preceding abundance limits and values pose a very interesting challenge due to their drastic departures from thermo - equilibrium predictions , which indicate the following rough - order - of - magnitude values : @xmath9 = 1000 ( 3@xmath1610@xmath17 ) ppm , @xmath10 = 1000 ( 10@xmath17 ) ppm , @xmath11 = 60 ( 10@xmath17 ) ppm , and @xmath12 = 0.1 ( 1000 ) ppm for 1x ( 50x ) solar metallicities at @xmath18bar . in either metallicity scenario , water and methane",
    "remain abundant ( @xmath19 1000 ppm ) , whereas the retrieval shows water being relatively depleted and methane being drastically depleted .",
    "moreover , the thermo - equilibrium abundances of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are positively correlated ( either both low in the 1@xmath16 case or both high in the 50@xmath16 case ) , in contrast with the retrieval s anti - correlation . in particular , the retrieved partioning of carbon overwhelmingly in oxidized species amidst a hydrogen - dominated ( reducing ) , temperate atmosphere is very surprising . for instance , at 1-bar pressure and solar metallicity , ch@xmath0 is the thermodynamically dominant carbon - bearing molecule for temperatures less than 1100 k ( lodders & fegley 2002 ) .",
    "the common practices of simply adjusting metallicity and/or the c / o ratio can not simultaneously reconcile these discrepancies .",
    "therefore , one must investigate disequilibrium mechanisms .",
    "madhusudhan & seager ( 2011 ) posited that high metallicity combined with vertical mixing can explain the disequilibrium abundance of carbon oxides .",
    "basically , enhanced metallicity ( @xmath4 10@xmath16 solar ) can provide the requisite abundance of co@xmath7 . since equilibrium co abundance drops sharply with respect",
    "to temperature ( lodders & fegley 2002 ) the retrieved uniformly high abundance of co requires eddy mixing to populate upper , cooler , atmospheric layers .",
    "however , vertical eddy mixing alone can not explain the large depletion of ch@xmath0 due to its innately high thermochemical abundance in the deep atmosphere . therefore , madhusudhan & seager ( 2011 ) invoked photochemistry as the potential culprit , based on zahnle et al.s ( 2009a , b ) studies of photochemistry on hot jupiters .",
    "in such a scheme , photosensitized sulfur chemistry produces atomic h , which then destroys ch@xmath0 to form higher hydrocarbons .",
    "however , the zahnle et al .",
    "( 2009a , b ) model uses solar - type stellar irradiance and an isothermal atmsophere ( i.e. constant temperature versus altitude ) . as such ,",
    "neither the photochemical driver nor the thermal environment is tailored for our planet in question .",
    "more severely , moses et al .",
    "( 2011 ) pointed out that a typo in a key rate coefficient in the zahnle et al .",
    "( 2009a , b ) model caused the apparent conversion of methane into higher hydrocarbons at pressures larger than 1 mbar . generally speaking , at pressures larger than 1 mbar in a hydrogen - abundant atmosphere , hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons and reaction intermediates efficiently",
    "recycle species back to methane , preventing its large- scale destruction .",
    "moses et al .",
    "( 2011 ) also discussed the inadequacies of isothermal atmospheric models due to their suppression of transport - induced quenching .",
    "hence , the observed ch@xmath0 depletion still awaits adequate explanation .",
    "the low abundance of h@xmath7o also has not been addressed .",
    "in addition to secondary eclipse observations , primary transit observations of gj 436b exist as well ( pont et al . 2009 , ballard et al .",
    "2010 , beaulieu et al .",
    "2011 , knutson et al 2011 ) , and various groups have analyzed them to retrieve molecular abundances in the planet s terminator regions ( beaulieu et al 2011 , knutson et al 2011 ) .",
    "in contrast to the secondary - eclipse retrieval , beaulieu et al . ( 2011 ) were able to fit a compendium of their and ballard et al.s tansit observations between 0.5 and 9 @xmath5 m with 500 ppm ch@xmath0 in a h@xmath7 atmosphere , and finding no clear evidence for co or co@xmath7 .",
    "moreover , beaulieu et al . presented that a methane - rich atmosphere , with temperature inversion , can be consistent with the said secondary - eclipse data as well ( but see shabram et al .",
    "more recently , knutson et al .",
    "acquired spitzer transit photometry at 3.6 , 4.5 , and 8.0 @xmath5 m during 11 visits .",
    "the multiple - visit data showed high transit - depth variability , which the authors attribute to potential stellar activity in the dm host .",
    "they did not find any compelling evidence for methane , and data excluding ones believed to be most affected by stellar activity appear to place an upper limit of 10 ppm for methane mixing ratio .",
    "the best - fit spectrum to this select data set assumes 1000 ppm h@xmath7o , 1000 ppm co , 1 ppm ch@xmath0 , with co@xmath7 abundance poorly constrained , roughly in agreement with madhusudhan et al .",
    "therefore , primary - transit data is currently inconclusive due to different interpretations by different groups .",
    "our primary goal is to advance the fundamental understanding of processes impacting the chemical state of gj  436b by developing a 1-d atmospheric model that integrates all of the aforementioned equilibrium and disequilibrium processes .",
    "an important aspect of our model is the seamless integration of thermochemistry , kinetics , vertical mixing , and photochemistry in a manner that directly follows from visscher et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , and contemporaneously with moses et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , obviating the conventional quench - level estimation ( prinn & barshay 1977 ) .",
    "the quench - level approach assumes that the deep atmosphere is in thermochemical equilibrium because high temperatures provide sufficient kinetic energy to overcome reaction barriers in either direction .",
    "however , as vertical tranport lifts a gas parcel to cooler , higher altitudes , chemistry becomes rate limited rather than thermodynamically determined .",
    "there comes a point in altitude where the kinetic conversion time scale becomes slower than the transport time scale , and the rate - limiting reaction for a molecule of interest is not allowed time to reach completion . at altitudes above this point ,",
    "the molecule s concentration is frozen / quenched ( therefore , the term  quench level \" ) . in effect , the quench - level approach partitions the atmosphere into two parts : below the quench level , thermochemical equilibrium determines chemical abundances ; above the quench level , molecular abundances are uniform versus altitude , with values equal to the equilibrium value at the appropriate quench level for each species .",
    "although this approach has a long record of success ( e.g. , prinn & barshay 1977 ; smith 1998 ; griffith & yelle 1999 ; saumon et al .",
    "2003 ; 2006 ; 2007 ; hubeny & burrows 2007 ; cooper & showman 2006 ) , it does have some limiting assumptions and caveats that require great judiciousness .",
    "specifically , one needs to determine the appropriate rate - limiting , interconversion reaction for each set of coupled species of interest ( e.g. , interconversion between ch@xmath0 & co ) . the correct reaction choice is not always readily apparent ( see e.g. , visscher et al .",
    "2010 ) and the appropriate length scale for deriving the mixing time scale from the vertical eddy diffusion coefficient ( @xmath20 ) is still under some debate . furthermore , since a basic assumption is that temperature decreases with altitude , atmospheric temperature inversions can complicate matters .",
    "therefore , we implemented a fully reversible kinetic model in the following manner .",
    "every measured forward reaction rate in our list is reversed using the equilibrium constant and the principle of microscopic reversibility .",
    "given enough pathways , both forward and backwards , a given set of chemical species will reach thermochemical equilibrium , kinetically .",
    "this provides a seamless transition from the thermochemical equilibrium regime to the disequilibrium - dominated regimes .",
    "we can investigate the disequilibrium effects on atmospheric composition in a much more holistic , systematic manner , compared to heuristically identifying plausible disequilibrium processes .    in the remainder of this manuscript",
    "we describe the disequilibrium processes that may be occurring in gj436b s atmosphere .",
    "in @xmath212 we describe thermochemical and chemical kinetics models as well as our estimate for the stellar uv flux . in @xmath213",
    "we show the modeling results as well as a description of the important reaction schemes governing the abundances of various species .",
    "finally in @xmath214 we discuss the relevant implications and conclude .",
    "we use joint thermochemistry and `` 1-d chemical - kinetics with photochemistry '' models to study the atmosphere s departure from thermal equilibrium .",
    "external inputs to our models are the metals fraction ( denoted further on by @xmath22 ) , the pressure and temperature ( t - p ) profile , the eddy diffusion coefficient profile , and the incident stellar flux ; note that we fix the t - p profile and the chemistry is decoupled from it , i.e. , there is no self - consistent , radiative - convective adjustment of temperature structure when the chemistry is evolved towards steady state .",
    "we initialize the 1-d atmospheres using the nasa chemical equilibrium with applications ( cea ) model ( gordon & mcbride 1996 ) .",
    "given the initial elemental abundances of h , he , c , o , n , and s in an atmospheric layer , along with the layer s pressure and temperature , cea uses a gibbs free - energy minimization and mass balance routine to calculate the equilibrium species abundances .",
    "whereas chemical equilibrium concentrations are useful for initializing the atmosphere , they do not provide the correct chemical state above pressure levels of @xmath23 bars ( prinn & barshay 1977 ; griffith & yelle 1999 ; cooper & showman 2006 ; line et al .",
    "2010 ; moses et al . 2011 ) .",
    "we simply supply the equilibirum mixing - ratios as boundary conditions in the deep atmosphere for the kinetics calculations , and thereafter evolve the chemical state over multiple timesteps until a steady state is reached .",
    "the computations are carried out with the caltech / jpl photochemical and kinetics model , kinetics ( a fully implicit , finite difference code ) , which solves the coupled continuity equations for each involved species , and includes transport via molecular and eddy diffusion ( allen et al .",
    "1981 ; yung et al . 1984 ; gladstone et al . 1996",
    "; moses et al . 2005 ) .",
    "we use the h , c , and o chemical reaction list originally described in liang et al.(2003 ; 2004 ) and references therein updated to high temperatures , recently augmented with a set of n reactions .",
    "we have not included the chemistry of sulfur in any great detail , because much of its kinetics is poorly constrained ( see e.g. , moses et al .",
    "however we do consider a small , but well measured , set of h@xmath7s reactions .",
    "this helps us appraise if and how the introduction of s affects the abundances of the main molecular reservoirs of h , c , n , o such as ch@xmath0 .",
    "we use high temperature rate coefficients for reactions from line et al .",
    "all reactions are bidirectional , and we reverse them by calculating the back - reaction rates using thermodynamic data ( see table s1 ) . with appropriate reaction pathways and proper rates for the back - reactions , the models can converge to chemical equilibrium purely kinetically in the deep planetary atmosphere where reaction timescales are short compared to transport timescales , and photochemical reactions are unimportant . as mentioned earlier , this removes the cumbersome requirement of having to choose a lower boundary for individual species through _ ad hoc _ quench - level arguments ( prinn & barshay 1977 ; smith et al .",

    "we have developed a 1d `` thermochemical and photochemical kinetics with transport '' model following visscher et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and recently , moses et al . ( 2011 ) for extrasolar planet atmospheres .",
    "we use a compilation of bidirectional reactions of the five most abundant elements to model both the equilibrium and disequilibrium portions of the atmosphere . using detailed balance with",
    "both forward and reverse reactions , allows our model to reach thermochemical equilibrium kinetically , thereby obviating the need to choose _ ad hoc _ lower boundaries for multiple quenched species , and allowing a seamless transition between the transport dominated and the chemical equilibrium zones .",
    "a limitation is that we adopt a static temperature structure ; a future improvement would allow the iterative adjustment and co - evolution of the temperature structure with the chemistry . also , the eddy diffusivity profile @xmath226 is poorly constrained , and is essentially a free parameter in any of these models .    we have applied our models to study the atmosphere of the transiting neptune - like planet gj  436b .",
    "the elemental abundance of atmosphere , a key input parameter , is relatively uncertain , but mass - radius constraints suggest that gj  436b must be enriched to at least @xmath227 solar levels .",
    "we model a range of atmospheric enrichment to cover this instrinsic uncertainty ; we observe the trends when varying @xmath22 , and rule out the possibility that intermediate values of @xmath22 would spring any surprises .",
    "the uv fluxes of stars other than the sun are often difficult to obtain .",
    "m - dwarf hosts can be chromospherically hyperactive , and because uv photolysis may drive the depletion of weakly bonded molecules such as ch@xmath0 , nh@xmath26 and h@xmath7s , it is important to have an accurate uv estimate for gj  436 .",
    "we use a combination of galex and hst uv fluxes along with rosat and xmm - newton soft x - ray fluxes to bound the uv continuum and line emission of gj  436 .",
    "the gj  436b model atmospheres show that a combination of photochemistry , chemical kinetics and transport - induced quenching drives the composition well out of equilibrium . while equilibrium conditions are maintained in the deep , hot , troposphere ( below a 10s of bars for @xmath228 , and 100s of bars for @xmath229 ) , the composition of the middle atmosphere is altered by the dredging up of quenched gases such as co and nh@xmath26 .",
    "the effects of transport disequilibrium are prominent in cooler planets such as gj  436b because the quench points for major species depend on the temperature .",
    "as it gets colder , the pressure points for quenching are pushed deeper into the atmosphere due to the longer interconversion timescales from one species reservoir to another .",
    "in contrast to the quenched species ( co , co@xmath7 , nh@xmath26 ) , the effect of vertical mixing on the reservoir gases such as ch@xmath0 and h@xmath7o is relatively feeble .",
    "the reservoir gases h@xmath7o and ch@xmath0 , and nh@xmath26 are largely unaffected by photochemistry because of their ( a ) large abundances , and ( b ) rapid recycling .",
    "nevertheless , it is their photolysis that drives the bulk of the disequilibrium chemistry in the upper atmosphere producing ch@xmath0 and nh@xmath26 sinks such as heavier hydrocarbons ( such as c@xmath7h@xmath7 , etc . ) and simple nitriles ( such as hcn ) .",
    "much as in the hot jupiters ( liang et al .",
    "2003 ) , h is the most important and active atom in the bulk of the atmosphere ; it is created by the photosensitized destruction of h@xmath7 , catalyzed by the presence of h@xmath7o and h@xmath7s .",
    "the latter gas , though less abundant than water , is important because of its ability to capture incident starlight photons out wavelengths as long as @xmath230  . in most models ,",
    "h replaces h@xmath7 as the most abundant species in the atmosphere above the planetary homopause at @xmath231 @xmath232bar . because ch@xmath0 is the largest c carrier in the planet s uv photosphere ,",
    "we create abundant c@xmath7 compounds ( figure 7 ) despite the relatively efficient hydrogenation back to ch@xmath0 .",
    "species such as acetylene , c@xmath7h@xmath7 , formed in abundance in our enriched models , are precursors for potential hydrocarbon soot formation in the upper atmosphere ( as opposed to the hotter jupiters such as hd  209458b and hd  189733b , wherein co carries the bulk of carbon in the stratosphere ) .",
    "our reaction lists for hyrdocarbon chemistry are truncated at c@xmath7 , and so we do not synthesize c@xmath26 and heavier hydrocarbons and nitriles explicitly .    within the range physical and chemical processes captured in our models , and the considered reaction sets and their kinetics ,",
    "we find it difficult explain the observations suggesting a methane - poor gj  436b . except above 1 @xmath5bar pressure levels where ch@xmath0 is photochemically converted to co , hcn and c@xmath7 hydrocarbons",
    ", it remains the predominant c reservoir in the lower atmosphere and in the region of the ir photosphere .",
    "the observed abundances of quenched co and co@xmath7 are in agreement with an atmosphere enriched to levels intermediate between 1 to 50 times solar ( as in madhusudhan & seager 2011 ) .",
    "the depleted water may either contrarily suggest a sub solar metallicity ( table 1 ) , or skewed heavy metals ratios ; the latter is a possibility which we have not considered herein as there are far too many combinations to explore . in the 1@xmath16 solar models , the methane abundance is consistent with the values retrieved by beaulieu et al .",
    "( 2010 ) ( table 1 ) using transit observations .",
    "we suppose it is possible that a more complete inclusion of other relatively abundant elements such as s and p , or distorted elemental ratios ( c / o or o / s etc . ) , or ill - understood chemistry and exotic processes ( not considered herein , such as the 3 dimensionality of the problem ) could do more to explain the chemistry of this enigmatic atmosphere .",
    "we agree with moses et al .",
    "( 2011 ) that quench level arguments can be used to predict abundances , so long as this is done with the appropriate level of caution . by this , we mean that the relevant rate - limiting reaction must necessarily be identified in order to properly calculate the timescale for chemical loss .",
    "also , quenched gases do not share a common quench level and assuming so can result in gross under- or overestimation of their abundances .",
    "for example , as shown herein , n@xmath7 and co have vastly different quench levels . for the moderate to high levels of incident uv flux",
    ", photolysis generates high concentrations of secondary byproducts , but does not significantly alter the abundances of the reservoir gases ; in our estimation photochemistry can not alter the dayside methane budget .",
    "hotter atmospheres with sluggish vertical mixing and hot stratospheres are required for severe methane depletion .",
    "for example , in figure 10 , we approximate such as atmosphere as isothermal with @xmath233 k , @xmath234 , and @xmath20=@xmath235 @xmath44s@xmath45 , and with zero uv irradiation ( similar to models by zahnle et al .",
    "2009 ) . in this hypothetical atmosphere",
    "there is relatively little quenched methane . at @xmath233",
    "k and low pressures , the rate determining step for ch@xmath0 @xmath236 co ( reverse of r351 ) is faster than the vertical transport time throughout the atmosphere , allowing the ch@xmath0 to be in thermochemical equilibrium with co everywhere ( figure 10 ) . since equilibrium conditions apply , the @xmath95 term in equation 2 results in the rapid vertical fall - off of ch@xmath0 .    , co@xmath7 , and h@xmath7o assuming a t=1200 k isothermal atmosphere , @xmath237 , and @xmath20=@xmath235 @xmath44s@xmath45 , with no photochemistry .",
    "the observed methane fall - off is due to high temperatures alone ; high temperatures imply a short chemical loss time for of ch@xmath0 . because of the large transport time , ch@xmath0 and co are nearly in equilibrium at all altitudes.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the models presented herein are by no means restricted in applicability to gj  436b like neptunes , and much of the modeled chemical state may be generalized to h / he dominated planets in the 500 - 1000 k temperature range . in this regime ch@xmath0 is the primary carbon carrier and co is quenched .",
    "the reverse is true in hotter atmospheres , @xmath238 k , where co is the primary carbon carrier and ch@xmath0 is quenched .",
    "nh@xmath26 is quenched deep in the atmosphere and can be quite abundant in the photosphere .",
    "higher hydrocarbons and hcn are produced photochemically in relatively high abundances at mbar to @xmath5bar pressures .",
    "similarly , an enhancement of co and co@xmath7 over the quench concentrations , driven by the photolysis of h@xmath7o , is observed in the high atmosphere .",
    "water is in gaseous phase and abundant , and not condensed out as it would be in cooler atmospheres .",
    "gj  1214b , a @xmath239 k low super earth or mini neptune , also orbiting an m dwarf primary ( charbonneau et al . 2009 ; sada et al . 2010 ; bean et al . 2010 ; carter et al . 2011 ; dsert et al . 2011 ) , falls in this regime of warm atmospheres .",
    "if gj  1214b is in possession of a reducing h - he atmosphere ( croll et al . 2011 ;",
    "crossfield et al .",
    "2011 ) , much of the atmospheric chemistry would be analogous to that in gj  426b ; this , however , is speculative as there is much current debate over the bulk composition of gj  1214b .",
