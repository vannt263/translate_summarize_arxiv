    "together with the possible existence of extra spatial dimensions , supersymmetry ( susy ) remains the prime candidate for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . among the many undisputed theoretical advantages of the minimal supersymmetric sm ( mssm ) , the intimate connection of this new space - time symmetry with electroweak symmetry breaking is of particular importance .",
    "the search for sm or mssm higgs bosons as well as for spin-0 and spin-1/2 partners of the sm fermions and gauge bosons are therefore often considered to be the most important tasks for present and future collider experiments .    for many years , the focus has been on minimal supergravity ( msugra ) models , in which susy is broken by gravitational interactions and the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) is the photino or , more generally , the lightest of four neutralinos , @xmath3 . only around 1980",
    "it was discovered that the susy partner of the spin-2 graviton , the massless spin-3/2 gravitino , does not necessarily couple to matter with gravitational strength only , but that its coupling can be enhanced to electroweak strength once susy is broken through the super - higgs mechanism and the associated goldstone fermion , the spin-1/2 goldstino , is absorbed to give the gravitino its mass and its longitudinal degrees of freedom , making it the lsp @xcite .",
    "the electroweak strength of goldstino interactions with massless photons and photinos was then used to impose limits on the gravitino mass by comparing total theoretical cross sections for electron - positron colliders to experimental single - photon searches at pep and petra , resulting in a first mass limit of @xmath4 ev @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the single - photon searches at lep 1 and lep 161 with cross section limits of 0.1 and 1 pb implied gravitino masses above @xmath5 and @xmath6 ev for light neutralinos of mass below 50 and 100 gev , respectively @xcite .",
    "these limits where , however , obtained without imposing missing or observed photon energy cuts on the theoretical cross section .    in 1988 , the cdf collaboration published a cross section limit of 100 pb for their monojet search at the fermilab @xmath7 collider tevatron @xcite , which they used to impose bounds on the squark - gluino mass plane , but which could also be interpreted as the absence of a light ( s)goldstino signal , yielding @xmath8 ev and @xmath9 gev @xcite",
    ". this first hadron - collider analysis assumed , however , very heavy squarks of @xmath10 gev and was based on partonic subprocesses involving only gluons and gluinos , but no ( s)quarks .",
    "the analysis was later re - applied to the 1996 cdf multijet cross section limit of 1.4 pb @xcite , yielding @xmath11 ev and @xmath12 gev @xcite .",
    "predictions were also made for the lhc , albeit for an assumed center - of - mass energy of 16 tev @xcite .",
    "while the gluon - gluon initial state dominates indeed for the production of light final states at the lhc , it is well known that it is the quark - antiquark luminosity that dominates at the tevatron and that quark - gluon initiated qcd compton processes contribute significantly for heavier final states at the lhc .",

    "next , we present the various subprocess contributions to the total cross sections at the tevatron and lhc and compute the jet and missing transverse - momentum spectra , taking into account the gluino / squark decays . finally , we deduce a new limit on the gravitino mass from the latest cdf monojet search and discuss the signal size and missing-@xmath19 trigger thresholds at the lhc .",

    "we also implement the experimental requirement that at least one jet lies in the central region , @xmath126 , since this cut is stricter than the additional cdf - cut on the hardest jet to lie in @xmath127 , and our parton - level analysis has only one jet .",
    "we have verified that the number of events with a hard jet in the region @xmath128 is indeed negligible .    from our confirmation of figs .  5 and 6 in @xcite we know that the two production processes that involve both the squark and gluino mass ( @xmath13 and @xmath129 ) are bounded from below for @xmath130 , while the third production process @xmath14 depends only on the gluino mass .",

[ fig:10 ] ) .",
