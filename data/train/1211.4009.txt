    "collective flow continues to play a central role in ongoing efforts to characterize the transport properties of the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) produced in heavy ion collisions at rhic .",
    "an experimental manifestation of this flow is the anisotropic emission of particles in the plane transverse to the beam direction .",
    "this anisotropy can be characterized by the fourier coefficients @xmath4 determined relative to the estimated participant event planes @xmath14 : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the azimuthal angle of an emitted particle , @xmath17 is a resolution factor which accounts for the dispersion of the azimuthal angle of @xmath14 , and brackets denote averaging over particles and events .",
    "the anisotropic emission of particles can also be characterized equivalently by the pair - wise distribution in the azimuthal angle difference ( @xmath18 ) between particle pairs with transverse momenta @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( respectively ) @xmath21    r0.55        significant attention has been given to the use of @xmath22 measurements for the extraction of the specific shear viscosity @xmath13 , ( ie .",
    "the ratio of viscosity to entropy density )  @xcite . however , the uncertainty for @xmath13 remains large , primarily because of an uncertainty in the initial state geometry used in model calculations .",
    "recent developments suggest that the higher order flow harmonics @xmath23 for inclusive charged hadrons , provide tighter constraints for disentangling the respective role of initial state geometry and @xmath13  @xcite . consequently",
    ", systematic measurements of the flow coefficients @xmath24 for identified particle species might be expected to provide additional constraints .",
    "in phenix , flow coefficients are extracted via the event plane method ( eq .  [ eq:1 ] ) and the long - range two particle correlation method ( 2pc ) ( eq .",
    "[ eq:2 ] ) .",
    "the results presented at qm(and in this proceeding ) are for particles produced at mid - rapidity , and reconstructed in the phenix central arms .",
    "r0.59        for the event plane method ( ep ) ( cf .",
    "eq.[eq:1 ] ) , several event plane detectors , with different pseudo - rapidity ( @xmath25 ) coverages were employed : the raction plane detector(rxnp : @xmath26 ) , the muon piston calorimeter(mpc : @xmath27 ) and the beam - beam counter(bbc : @xmath28 ) .",
    "these event planes enabled robust consistency checks , as well as reliable systematic error estimates . the 2pc method ( cf .",
    "eq.[eq:2 ] ) was performed by correlating tracks in the central phenix arm ( @xmath29 ) with hits in rxnp ( @xmath30 ) to produce correlation functions ( the ratio of the distributions for correlated pairs and uncorrelated pairs from mixed events ) .",
    "the flow coefficients were extracted by fourier analyzing these correlation functions .",
    "the flow coefficients @xmath31 obtained with both methods , for pions ( @xmath32 ) , kaons ( @xmath33 ) and ( anti)protons ( @xmath34 ) in 0 - 50% central au+au collisions at @xmath35 gev , are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1 ] . the open symbols ( 2pc method ) and",
    "filled symbols ( ep method ) indicate good consistency , suggesting that `` non - flow '' correlation ( primarily from jet fragmentation and resonance decays ) might be small .",
    "the relatively large values of @xmath36 between the phenix central arms and the event plane detectors serve to reduce such correlations .",
    "similarly good agreement were obtained for finer ( 10% ) centrality cuts .",
    "r0.6        [ fig : figure3 ]    figure  [ fig : figure2 ] compares the respective @xmath37 values obtained at @xmath38 and 200 gev , for each particle species . within systematic errors , the flow coefficients for @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34",
    "respectively , indicate very little , if any , change as the beam energy is increased .",
    "this points to a possible `` saturation '' of collective flow for the beam energy range @xmath39 gev . here , it is important to emphasize that the saturation reflected in the comparison for each particle species _ can not _ arise from the interplay between radial and elliptic flow which could result in a cancellation between the @xmath4 values for light and heavier particles to give a constant @xmath4 with beam collision energy @xcite .",
    "such a saturation could however , result from a softening of the equation of state .",
    "r0.59        the number of constituent quark ( ncq ) scaling properties of these flow measurements are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : figure4 ] for @xmath35 gev and 39 , 62.4 gev respectively .",
    "they indicate that @xmath40 vs. @xmath6 ( for n=2,3,4 ) scale to a single curve , confirming that ncq scaling also holds for the lower beam energies of @xmath41 and 62.4 gev . a comparison between rhic and lhc @xmath10",
    "is shown for the 20 - 30% most central collisions in fig.[fig : figure7 ] .",
    "it indicates a larger flow for pions and kaons at all @xmath1 s as might be expected from the significant energy density increase from rhic to lhc . for ( anti)protons , the lhc values are larger than the rhic values for @xmath1 @xmath42 2.5 gev / c",
    ", however this trend is inverted for lower @xmath1 .",
    "the latter inversion can be attributed to a much larger radial flow [ at the lhc ] which gives a larger blueshift to the @xmath10 values for ( anti)protons @xcite .",
    "note that , in contrast to our measurements for identified particle species at rhic , this interplay between radial and elliptic flow results in a subtle cancellation between increasing contributions from light , and decreasing contributions from heavier particles to make inclusive charged hadron @xmath43 similar at rhic and the lhc .",
    "the reported @xmath4 measurements should provide important additional constraints for @xmath13 extraction via future model comparisons .",

    "the new measurements show a `` saturation '' of flow , consistent with our previous inclusive charged hadron flow measurements . however , a comparison of @xmath10 for individual particle species obtained in au+au collisions at rhic and pb+pb collisions at the lhc , indicate stronger collective flow at the lhc . at the lhc",
    ", the interplay between radial and elliptic flow leads to a subtle cancellation between the @xmath4 values for light and heavier particles , to make the magnitude of inclusive charged hadron @xmath4 similar to those at rhic .",
