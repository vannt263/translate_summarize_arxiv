    "the investigation we present here deals with the stellar content of the star forming region in the vicinity of the stellar association ngc 346 in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) .",

    "such active star forming regions are rare and can only be compared to star - bursts , like e.g. , ngc 3603 in our galaxy ( sher 1964 ) . as a consequence ngc 346 has been the subject of intense studies to establish the properties of the hii region and of the bright early - type stellar content of the association in the low - metallicity environment of the smc .    in a spectroscopic study of 42 bright main sequence stars",

    "the majority of the stars reveal cno cycle - processed material at their surfaces during the main - sequence stage , thus indicating fast stellar rotation and/or very efficient mixing processes .",
    "the derived effective temperatures are lower than predicted from the widely used relation between spectral type and @xmath4 , resulting in lower stellar luminosities and lower ionizing fluxes .    however , massey et al .",
    "( 2005 ) argue that the data used by bouret et al .",
    "( 2003 ) were limited with respect to sky ( nebular ) subtraction .",
    "the effective temperatures of o3 - o7 dwarfs and giants in the smc , as found by massey et al .",
    "( 2005 ) from their investigation of 33 o - type stars in the magellanic clouds , are about 4000 k hotter than for stars of the same spectral type in the milky way . consequently , the effective temperature scale for o dwarfs in ngc 346 derived by these authors is significantly hotter than the bouret et al .",
    "( 2003 ) values .",
    "the differences decrease as one approaches stars of spectral type b0  v. in general , massey et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found that the winds momentum of o stars in the magellanic clouds scales with luminosity and metallicity as predicted by the theory for radiatively driven wind ( kudritzki 2002 ; vink et al . 2001 ) , supporting the use of photospheric analyses of hot luminous stars as a distance indicator for galaxies with resolved massive stellar populations .",
    "a search for be - stars in a field of 10  @xmath2 10   centered on ngc 346 ( keller et al .",
    "1999 ) found that only about 11% of the upper main sequence stars ( with v @xmath5 16 mag ) located in the main body of the association show indeed strong h  emission .",
    "these authors adopt the most widely accepted explanation for the be phenomenon , the rapid rotation of the b star ( bjorkman & cassinelli 1993 ) , due to which the stellar wind from a star is concentrated and confined to a disk around its equatorial plane .",
    "they relate , thus , the low fraction of be stars in the cluster with the suggestion that it has been formed from low angular momentum gas .",
    "the general area of ngc 346/n 66 hosts at least two supernova remnants .",

    "danforth et al .",
    "( 2003 ) proposed a physical relationship between snr 0057@xmath67226 and n 66 , which suggests a slowly expanding bubble around ngc 346 , powered by stellar winds and thermal pressure , while strong o vi , c iii , and x - ray emission arise from the shock interaction of the super - nova remnant with the denser , ionized gas on the rear side of n 66 .",

    "the main sequence is becoming highly populated with what should be considered to be a well mixed collection of low - mass stars of several ages . under this assumption ,",
    "the lower main sequence ( lms ) represents stars , which are located in one region of the cmd , but they could have been born during completely different star formation events . to the right of lms and toward redder colors",
    "we find a concentration of low - mass stars , that do not fit to any classical scheme of stellar populations .",
    "most likely they are pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars .",
    "such stars have been found to exist in stellar associations of the magellanic clouds .",
    "gouliermis et al .",
    "( 2006 ) presented recently the case of the association lh 52 in the large magellanic cloud , where they identified the candidate pms population of the system with hst / wfpc2 observations in @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the detected pms stars of lh 52 have the same location on the @xmath11 , @xmath8 cmd with the faint red sequence we observe in the cmd of figure [ fig - cmd ] to the right of the lms .",
    "as far as the association ngc 346 is concerned , brandner et al .",
    "( 1999 ) already reported the detection of about 150 objects with excess emission in h in a 2  @xmath2 2  field slightly off the brightest stars of the association .",
    "they explained this detection as an indication that ngc 346 hosts pms stars with masses between 1 and 2 m. more recently , nota et al .",
    "( 2006 ) used their observations of ngc 346 , taken within visit j92fa3 ( see table 1 ) in filters f555w ( @xmath8 ) , f814w ( @xmath9 ) and f658n ( h ) , and they verified that there is a prominent population of candidate pms stars located in this part of the cmd , `` that have likely formed together with ngc 346 about 3 - 5 myr ago '' .",
    "in order to make a first - order characterization of the observed stellar species we select four regions in the cmd , where each corresponds to one of the most prominent observed cmd features ( ums , lms , rgb and pms ) . the limits of the selected cmd regions are shown in figure [ fig - cmd ] .",
    "we distinguish , thus , four selected stellar groups , and we plot the spatial distribution of each one with the use of star counts .",
    "we identify the area in the observed region where each type of stars is dominant by performing star counts , and we construct the spatial density distribution of each stellar kind .",
    "we use the photometric catalog of the detected stars to perform star counts on square grids , under the assumption that each star is a point determined by its coordinates in the catalog . each grid element has dimensions @xmath15 70 wfc pixels , or @xmath15 35 , which corresponds to about 1 pc at the distance of the smc of about 60 kpc ( dolphin et al .",
    "this star count algorithm is originally used for the detection of stellar associations and open clusters in the large magellanic cloud by gouliermis et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , who also give a detailed description of the method .",
    "the high resolution of acs / wfc imaging and the large stellar sample allow the construction of detailed maps of the spatial density distributions for each stellar group ( isodensity contour maps ) .",
    "the constructed contour maps are shown in figure [ fig - con ] .",
    "the lowest isopleth corresponds to the background surface density and isopleths of higher surface density are plotted in steps of 1@xmath16 , where @xmath16 is the standard deviation of the background density .",
    "any stellar concentration with density equal to or higher than 3@xmath16 above the background density ( fourth isopleth in the maps of figure [ fig - con ] ) is considered to be statistically significant .",
    "these maps show that not only different stellar populations dominate different areas of the observed region , but also their spatial distribution is very clumpy .",
    "the rgb and lms groups seem to characterize mostly the massive old star cluster bs 90 ( bica & schmitt 1995 ) , while the ums and pms stars are mostly concentrated in the general area of the association ngc 346 .",
    "it is interesting to note that two compact concentrations of ums and pms stars can be seen in the corresponding maps to the north - east of the main association .",
    "the two dominant stellar systems in the area can be identified in the contour maps of figure [ fig - con ] , from which an indication of the extent of the systems can be easily derived .",
    "specifically , we select the areas , centered on the association ngc 346 and the cluster bs 90 , as they are defined by the 3@xmath16 isopleths in figure [ fig - con ] . for bs 90 we use the rgb and lms maps and for the association the ums and pms ones .",
    "a circular area has been selected for the cluster , which has almost the same dimensions in both lms and rgb contour maps .",
    "for the association we select a quadrilateral area , which confines the 3@xmath16 isopleth in both pms and ums contour maps .",
    "this kind of selection is made because of the irregular , non - spherical shape of the association , as it is typical for associations , which are characterized by their extended form .",
    "the location of the star cluster bs 90 is well defined by a circular area with radius around 8.5 pc , and the one of the main body of the association ngc 346 by a box of dimensions 14.1 @xmath2 10.2 pc .",
    "obviously the majority of the stars confined in each of the selected regions belongs to the populations of the corresponding systems and hence they represent the main stellar content of the systems .",
    "consequently the cmds of the stars in each region correspond to each of the systems .",
    "these cmds plotted for stars in the quadrilateral area centered on ngc 346 and a circle centered on bs 90 are both shown in figure [ fig - cmdsys ] .",
    "these plots provide a first order distinction between the two dominant stellar concentrations in the star forming region of ngc 346/n 66 , based on their stellar content .",
    "consequently , these cmds exhibit the variety of stellar species that are included in the relatively small observed 5   @xmath2 5 region .",
    "although bs 90 is a very bound and obviously massive star cluster ( see map of figure [ fig - map ] ) it was never given much attention because of the fact that its stellar content does not include any blue massive stars , which were the main targets of previous works , and probably also because it was out - shined by the large number of bright blue super - giants of the association ( see introduction ) .",
    "naturally , each of the cmds shown in figure [ fig - cmdsys ] does not fully account only for the stellar population in each of the corresponding systems , because it is contaminated by the contribution not only of the general field of smc at this region , which deserves an equally thorough study , but also of the population of the other system .",
    "this is more obvious in the cmd of bs 90 ( right panel ) , where the upper main sequence is populated by a small number of blue giants up to @xmath17 mag .",
    "probably this contamination comes from the association ngc 346 itself .",
    "the cmd of bs 90 is extremely sharp with a very clear turn - off and red giants branch , that make it a template cluster for the study of old clustered populations in the low - metallicity smc .",
    "a more detailed study on this cluster and its environment is under way for the investigation of the fundamental properties of the stellar content and the dynamical behavior of this cluster ( rochau et al . in preparation ) .    on the other hand the cmd of the area centered on ngc 346 association seems to be more clear from any old population contamination .",
    "a very interesting feature of this cmd is the very sharp upper main sequence , which is easily fitted by the zams , making the age determination of the association from these data alone very difficult .",
    "another interesting feature in this cmd is the secondary faint red sequence almost parallel to the lower main sequence , which obviously corresponds to the pms population of the association in agreement with the findings of nota et al .",
    "furthermore , the higher detection limit in comparison to bs 90 is a clear indication of the higher extinction that takes place in the area of the association .",
    "the case of the association ngc 346 is currently under detailed study by us for the specification of the extent of this system , the contamination of its cmd from the general field and the determination of its massive and low - mass initial mass function ( hennekemper et al . in preparation ) .",
    "we take advantage of the large improvement in sensitivity and wide - field resolution provided by acs to perform a detailed photometric study of the most active star forming region in the smc .",
    "we use the acs module of the photometric package dolphot , which is especially designed for imaging with the acs and we provide the full photometric catalog of all stars detected with short and long exposures in three acs / wfc fields , that covers a region of about 5  @xmath2 5  centered on the young stellar association ngc 346 .",
    "this region is a typical example of mixed stellar populations in the low - metallicity environment of the smc .",
    "the detailed study of the stellar systems and the ambient general field of smc in the region will provide new constraints for the determination of fundamental properties of concentrated stellar populations , such as relaxation time - scales and their mass functions .",
    "we distinguish on the observed cmd of almost 100,000 detected stars in total , four regions , as the most representative of different varieties : upper main sequence ( ums ) , red giant branch ( rgb ) , lower main sequence ( lms ) and pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars .",
    "we find that ums and pms represent mostly one of the two dominant stellar concentrations in the observed region , the stellar association ngc 346 , while rbg and lms are mostly populated at the recently discovered old star cluster bs 90 ( bica & schmitt 1995 ) .",
    "the cmds of the stars confined in the main central part of each of these two systems exhibit their differences in terms of their stellar content : the association ngc 346 is a well extended star forming system , while the cluster bs 90 is an old massive spherical star cluster , which can be considered a template for old low - metallicity populations .",
    "two investigations , one on bs 90 ( rochau et al . in preparation ) and the other on the association ngc 346 ( hennekemper et al . in preparation ) are under way to throw more light on these completely different neighboring stellar concentrations in the smc .",
    "these systems are only a part of the variety of interesting objects , that are located in the observed region .",
    "such are the components of the hii region n 66 ( henize 1956 ) , as they are distinguished by davies et al .",
    "( 1976 ) , small young star clusters ( oey et al . 2004 ) , and co clouds ( rubio et al . 2000 ) .",
    "in addition , the region is characterized by a plethora of x - ray sources ( naz et al .",
    "2003 ) , emission stars and small nebulae ( meyssonnier & azzopardi 1993 ) , and radio sources ( loiseau et al . 1987 ; filipovic et al .",
    "2002 ) , as well as luminous ir sources , revealed with iso and iras ( wilke et al . 2003 ) and _ spitzer _ ( brandl , 2005 )",

    "<S> we present a photometric study of the star - forming region ngc 346 and its surrounding field in the small magellanic cloud , using data taken with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on board the hubble space telescope ( hst ) . </S>",
    "<S> the data set contains both short and long exposures for increased dynamic range , and photometry was performed using the acs module of the stellar photometry package dolphot . </S>",
    "<S> we detected almost 100,000 stars over a magnitude range of @xmath0 to @xmath1 mag , including all stellar types from the most massive young stars to faint lower main sequence and pre - main sequence stars . </S>",
    "<S> we find that this region , which is characterized by a plethora of stellar systems and interesting objects , is an outstanding example of mixed stellar populations . </S>",
    "<S> we take into account different features of the color - magnitude diagram of all the detected stars to distinguish the two dominant stellar systems : the stellar association ngc 346 and the old spherical star cluster bs 90 . </S>",
    "<S> these observations provide a complete stellar sample of a field about 5  @xmath2 5   around the most active star - forming region in this galaxy . considering the importance of these data for various investigations in the area </S>",
    "<S> , we provide the full stellar catalog from our photometry . </S>",
    "<S> this paper is the first part of an ongoing study to investigate in detail the two dominant stellar systems in the area and their surrounding field . </S>"
