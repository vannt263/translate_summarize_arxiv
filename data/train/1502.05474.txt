    "a beam sweeping across the earth may be detected as a pulse that repeats with a periodicity equal to the rotation period of the star . because of the large mass of neutron stars , @xmath0  m@xmath1 , and their tiny size , radii @xmath2  km , ( see ref .   for a review of neutron - star properties )",
    "the rotation period of neutron stars is incredibly stable , with a stability comparable to that of the best atomic clocks on earth .",
    "this great period stability , combined with the fact that pulsars are often in a binary orbit with another star , makes them wonderful probes of relativistic gravity .",
    "tiny perturbations to their period resulting from , for example , relativistic effects in a binary orbit , may be detected and compared with the predictions of a gravitational theory .",
    "pulsars may also be used as detectors for gravitational waves passing through the galaxy . to separate the effects of gravitational waves from other perturbations , signals from pulsars in different directions on the sky",
    "must be compared  exactly analogous to the way laser - interferometer gravitational - wave detectors compare laser phases in perpendicular arms .",
    "more than 2400 pulsars are now known .",
    "the vast majority of them reside in our galaxy , typically at distances of a few thousand light - years from the sun .",
    "their pulse periods , @xmath3 , range between 1.4 milliseconds and 12 seconds and fall into two main groups .",
    "the so - called `` normal '' pulsars have periods longer than about 30 milliseconds and the `` millisecond '' pulsars ( msps ) have shorter periods .",
    "msps comprise about 15% of the known pulsar population .",
    "although pulsar periods are very stable , they are not constant . in their own reference frame",
    ", all pulsars are slowing down , albeit very slowly .",
    "pulsars are powered by their rotational energy .",
    "they have extremely strong magnetic fields and , as they spin , they emit streams of relativistic particles and so - called `` dipole radiation '' , electromagnetic waves with period equal to the rotation period of the star .",
    "these carry energy away from the star resulting in a steady increase in the pulse period .",
    "typical rates of period increase , @xmath4 , are a part in @xmath5 for normal pulsars and much less for msps . assuming that the surrounding magnetic field is predominantly dipole , the characteristic age @xmath6 of a pulsar is given by @xmath7 and their surface dipole magnetic field strength ( in gauss  tesla ] ) is @xmath8 figure  [ fg : ppdot ] shows the distribution of pulsars on the @xmath3 ",

    ", width=340 ]    normal pulsars and msps have quite different evolutionary histories . most if not all normal pulsars are formed in supernova explosions at the death of a massive star .",
    "they age with relatively constant @xmath11 until the pulse emission mechanism begins to fail when @xmath6 reaches about @xmath17  yrs .",
    "many young pulsars ( @xmath18  yrs ) are located within supernova remnants , with the most famous example being the crab pulsar , psr b0531 + 21 , located near the centre of the crab nebula .",
    "most young pulsars lie relatively close to the galactic plane , consistent with the idea that they are formed from massive stars .",
    "msps on the other hand are much more widely distributed in the galactic halo .",
    "they are believed to originate from old , slowly rotating and probably dead neutron stars that accrete matter and angular momentum from an evolving binary companion .",
    "this `` recycling '' process increases their spin rate so that they have periods in the millisecond range and re - energises the beamed emission ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .    figure  [ fg : ppdot ] shows that the majority of msps are members of a binary system , consistent with this formation scenario .",
    "the accretion also suppresses their apparent magnetic field , so that msps have @xmath19 values about five orders of magnitude less than normal pulsars . since the level of intrinsic period irregularities is related to @xmath4,@xcite it is this low @xmath11 that makes msps extremely stable clocks and suitable tools for the study of relativistic gravitation .",
    "figure  [ fg : ppdot ] also indicates the class of radio - quiet pulsars .",
    "essentially all of the 72 known radio - quiet pulsars are young and solitary .",
    "they include the so - called `` magnetars '' which lie in the upper right side of the @xmath3 ",
    "@xmath4 diagram where dipole magnetic fields are strongest .",
    "most double - neutron - star systems lie in the zone between the msps and the normal pulsars .",
    "these systems are believed to have been partially recycled prior to the formation of the second - born neutron star . in almost every case , the observed pulsar is the recycled one since it has a much longer active lifetime than the newly formed young pulsar .",
    "a famous exception to this is the double pulsar ( psr j0737@xmath203039a / b ) in which the second - born star ( b ) is ( or was ) still visible @xcite . on figure  [ fg : ppdot ]",
    "the b pulsar is the solitary double - neutron - star system on the right side of the plot .",
    "the double - neutron - star system identified near the middle of the plot contains the relatively young pulsar , psr j1906 + 0746 .",
    "there is some doubt about the nature of the companion in this system  it could be a heavy white dwarf @xcite .",
    "these double - neutron - star systems and their use as probes of relativistic gravity are discussed in some detail in section  [ sec : dns ] below .",
    "the most important contributions of pulsars to investigations of gravitational theories and gravitational waves rely on precision pulsar timing observations .",
    "these allow both the relativistic perturbations to binary orbits to be studied in detail and the potential detection of the tiny period fluctuations generated by gravitational waves passing through our galaxy . because of the importance of pulsar timing to these studies , we give here a brief review of its basic principles .    the basic observable in pulsar timing",
    "is the time of arrival ( toa ) of a pulse at an observatory .",
    "in fact , because of signal / noise limitations and the intrinsic fluctuation of individual pulse shapes , toa measurements are based on mean pulse profiles formed by synchronously averaging the data , typically for times between several minutes and an hour .",
    "the time at which a fiducial pulse phase ( usually near the pulse peak ) arrives at the telescope is determined by cross - correlating the observed mean pulse profile with a standard pulse template . a series of these toas is measured over many days , months , years and even decades for the pulsar of interest .",
    "these observatory toas are affected by the rotational and orbital motion of the earth ( and for satellite observatories , the orbital motion of the satellite ) . to remove these effects , the observed toas",
    "are referred to the solar - system barycentre ( centre of mass ) which is assumed to be inertial ( unaccelerated ) with respect to the distant universe .",
    "this correction makes use of a solar - system ephemeris giving predictions of the position of the centre of the earth with respect to the solar - system barycentre .",
    "such ephemerides , for example , the jet propulsion laboratory ephemeris de  421,@xcite are generated by fitting relativistic models to planetary and spacecraft data .",
    "the correction also takes into account the relativistic variations in terrestrial time resulting from the earth s motion .",
    "the resulting barycentric toas are then compared with predicted pulse toas based on a model for the pulsar .",
    "the pulsar model can have 20 or more parameters ; generally included are the pulse frequency ( @xmath21 ) , frequency time derivative ( @xmath22 ) , the pulsar position and the five keplerian binary parameters if the pulsar is a member of a binary system . if the data are recorded at different radio frequencies , it is also necessary to include the dispersion measure ( dm ) which quantifies the frequency - dependent delay suffered by the pulses as they propagate through the interstellar medium .    the differences between the observed and predicted toas are known as `` timing residuals '' . errors in any of the model parameters",
    "result in systematic variations in the timing residuals as a function of time .",
    "for example , if the model pulse frequency is too small , the residuals will grow linearly as illustrated in figure  [ fg : model_res ] . the required correction to the pulse frequency",
    "is given by the slope of this variation .",
    "an error in the pulsar position results in an annual sine curve which arises from the barycentric correction .",
    "the phase and amplitude of this curve give the corrections to the two position coordinates .",
    "similarly , a pulsar proper motion results in a linearly growing sine curve ( away from the reference epoch ) . for a sufficiently close pulsar , the curvature of the wavefront results in a biannual term in the residuals , and offsets in binary parameters result in terms which vary with the orbital periodicity .    since offsets in different parameters in general result in different systematic residual variations , it is possible to do a least - squares fit to the observed residuals for the correction to any desired parameter .",
    "the precision of the fitted parameters is often amazingly high .",
    "for example , the relative precision of the pulse frequency determination is @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the typical uncertainty in the toas and @xmath25 is the data span .",
    "since , for msps at least , @xmath24 is often @xmath26  @xmath27s and @xmath25 is often many years , the relative precision of the measured @xmath28 can easily exceed 1:10@xmath29 .",
    "similarly pulsar positions can be measured to micro - arcseconds and binary eccentricities measured to @xmath30 .",
    "these very high precisions often allow higher - order terms , for example , resulting from relativistic perturbations to the binary orbit , to be measured .    ) binary orbit of period 190 days .",

    "the discovery at arecibo observatory in 1974 of the first - known binary pulsar , psr b1913 + 16 , by hulse and taylor@xcite was remarkable in a number of respects .",
    "firstly , it showed that pulsars with short pulse periods but large characteristic ages ( 59  ms and @xmath15  yr , respectively , for psr b1913 + 16 ) could exist .",
    "the period of psr b1913 + 16 was second only to the crab pulsar , but its age was enormously greater than that of other short - period pulsars known at the time .",
    "secondly , it was in a binary orbit with a relatively massive star , very likely another neutron star , showing that an evolutionary pathway to such systems existed .",
    "thirdly , its orbital period was extraordinarily short , only 7.75  h , its eccentricity large , @xmath31 , and , as shown in figure  [ fg : b1913_vel ] , its maximum orbital velocity very high , @xmath32  km  s@xmath33 or 0.1% of the velocity of light . as was immediately recognised by hulse and taylor , these properties opened up the possibility that relativistic perturbations to the orbit were potentially measurable .",
    "lowest - order relativistic effects go as @xmath34 , and so the variations are of order 1:10@xmath35 , enormous by the standards of pulsar measurements .",
    "relativistic effects in binary motion can be expressed in terms of `` post - keplerian '' parameters that describe departures from keplerian motion ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "the first such parameter to be observed was periastron precession @xcite . in einstein s general theory of relativity ( gr ) the rate of periastron precession ( averaged over the binary orbit )",
    "is given by : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the longitude of periastron measured from the ascending node , @xmath38 is the orbital period , @xmath39s , @xmath40 is the gravitational constant , @xmath41 is the mass of the sun , @xmath42 is the orbital eccentricity and @xmath43 , the sum of the pulsar mass @xmath44 and the companion mass @xmath45 in solar units .",
    "it is worth noting that this is the same effect as the excess perihelion advance of mercury that was used by einstein@xcite as an observational verification of gr .",
    "the relativistic effect for mercury is just 43 arcsec per century , minuscule compared to the @xmath46 per year predicted and observed for psr b1913 + 16 .",
    "the next most significant parameter , normally labelled @xmath47 , describes the combination of gravitational redshift and 2nd - order ( or transverse ) doppler shift , both of which have the same dependence on orbital phase . in gr @xmath48 since the keplerian parameters are very well determined , measurement of @xmath49 and @xmath47 gives two equations in two unknowns , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and so the two stellar masses can be determined . for psr b1913 + 16 ,",
    "these are both close to 1.4  @xmath41 , confirming the double - neutron - star nature of the system .",
    "an important consequence of this was that the two stars could safely be treated as point masses in gr , thereby allowing precise tests of the theory .    given the keplerian parameters and the two masses , the next post - keplerian parameter , orbital decay due to the emission of gravitational waves from the system , given in gr by @xmath50 could be predicted and compared with observation .",
    "this therefore constituted a unique test of gr in strong - field gravity .",
    "after just four years , the @xmath51 term was well measured and shown to be consistent with the gr prediction @xcite . the orbital decay ,",
    "including more recent results , is illustrated in figure  [ fg : b1913_pbdot ] ; the ratio of observed to predicted orbit decay is @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that this near - perfect agreement relies on correcting the observed @xmath53 for the differential acceleration of the solar system and the pulsar system in the gravitational field of the galaxy .",
    "this correction is @xmath54 or about 1% of the observed value , and the uncertainty in the final result is dominated by the uncertainty in this correction .",
    "unfortunately , it is unlikely that this uncertainty will be significantly reduced in the near future since it mainly depends on the poorly known distance to the binary system .",
    "two more post - keplerian parameters , denoted by @xmath55 and @xmath56 , relate to the shapiro delay suffered by the pulsar signal while passing through the curved spacetime surrounding the companion star.@xcite the relations for them in gr are as follows : @xmath57 @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the projected semi - major axis of the pulsar orbit ( in time units ) , a keplerian parameter .",
    "the shapiro delay is generally only observable when the orbital inclination is relatively close to 90 , that is , the orbit is seen close to edge - on . for the hulse - taylor binary pulsar",
    "the orbital inclination is about 47and the shapiro delay is small and covariant with keplerian parameters .",
    "however it has been observed in a number of other neutron - star binary systems as will be discussed below .",
    "another relativistic effect , geodetic precession , has observable consequences for psr b1913 + 16 and several other binary pulsars .",
    "a neutron star formed in a supernova explosion receives a `` kick '' during or shortly after the explosion which typically gives the star a velocity of several hundred km  s@xmath33 @xcite .",
    "if the pulsar is a member of a binary system which is not disrupted by the kick , the orbital axis is changed so that pulsar spin axis , which was most likely aligned with the orbital axis prior to the explosion , is no longer aligned .",
    "since kick velocities are often comparable to or even larger than the orbital velocities , the misalignment angle can be large .",
    "precession of the spin axis will therefore alter the aspect of the radio beam seen by an observer and may even move the beam out of the line of sight .    in gr",
    ", the precessional angular frequency is given by @xmath60 for psr b1913 + 16 , the corresponding precessional period is about 297 years , so the aspect changes over observational data spans are small .",
    "never - the - less changes in the relative amplitude of the two peaks in the psr b1913 + 16 profile were reported by weisberg et al.@xcite and attributed to the effects of geodetic precession with a `` patchy '' beam . for a basically conal beam geometry",
    ", the separation of the two profile components would be expected to change and evidence for this was first found by kramer@xcite leading to an estimate of the misalignment angle of about 22 .",
    "a data set extending to 2001 was analysed by weisberg and taylor@xcite , obtaining results similar to those of kramer@xcite .",
    "their best - fitting model gives the `` peanut '' shaped beam shown in figure  [ fg : b1913_beam ] .",
    "clifton and weisberg@xcite have shown that a set of circular nested emission cones can also give apparent pulse - width variations similar to those observed . over the 20-year interval covered by the data set , the `` impact parameter '' ( minimum angle between the beam symmetry axis and the observer s line of sight ) has changed by a rather small amount , about 3 , from @xmath61 to @xmath62 .",
    "extrapolation of this model suggests that the pulsar will become unobservable in about 2025 .",
    "while this result is compatible with relativistic precession , it is not possible to derive an independent measure of the precessional rate from these data .",
    "psr b1534 + 12 , discovered by wolszczan in 1990,@xcite is a binary system with parameters quite similar to those of b1913 + 16 , notably a short orbital period ( @xmath63  hours ) , relatively high eccentricity ( @xmath64 ) and a compact orbit about 60% larger than that of psr b1913 + 16 .",
    "analysis of less than a year s data already allowed measurement of two post - keplerian parameters , @xmath49 and @xmath47 , thereby determining the masses of the two stars and confirming that they are both neutron stars .",
    "these results also showed that the orbit was more edge - on than that of psr b1913 + 16 , with an implied inclination angle of about 77 .",

    "a fourth test of gr , albeit less precise , was provided by an analysis of the evolution of the profile shape and polarisation , yielding a rate for the geodetic precession of the pulsar spin axis @xmath65  yr@xmath33 which is consistent with the value predicted by gr .",
    "figure  [ fg : b1534_m1m2 ] shows the so - called `` mass - mass '' diagram for psr b1534 + 12 , illustrating these constraints .",
    "if gr gives a correct description of the post - keplerian parameters , all of these constraints should be consistent with an allowed range of @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "for psr b1534 + 12 , the masses are most accurately constrained by @xmath49 and @xmath47 but the predicted constraint on @xmath51 appears to be inconsistent . as for psr b1913 + 16 , the measured value of @xmath51 must be corrected for kinematic effects resulting from the differential acceleration of the binary and solar system in the galaxy .",
    "psr b1534 + 12 is much closer to the sun that psr b1913 + 16 and the so - called `` shklovskii '' effect,@xcite an apparent radial acceleration resulting from transverse motion of the binary system ( @xmath66 , where @xmath27 is the pulsar proper motion and @xmath67 is the pulsar distance ) , is also important .",
    "the distance estimate is based on the pulsar dm and a model for the free electron density in the galaxy and is quite uncertain .",

    "constraints derived from the measured post - keplerian parameters assuming gr are shown pairs of lines with separation indicating the uncertainty range . for @xmath49 and @xmath47 , the uncertainty ranges are too small to see on the plot .",
    "in addition , a constraint from the measured spin precession rate is shown .",
    "( ref .  ) , width=321 ]      the discovery of the double pulsar system @xcite heralded a remarkable era for investigation of relativistic effects in double - neutron - star systems . in this system , the a pulsar was formed first and subsequently spun up to approximately its current period of 23  ms by accretion from its evolving binary companion .",
    "the companion then imploded to form the b pulsar which has since spun down to its current period of about 2.8  s. the orbital period is only 2.5 hours , less than a third of that for psr b1913 + 16 , and the projected semi - major axis @xmath68 is about 60% that of psr b1913 + 16 .",
    "these parameters imply relativistic effects much larger than those seen for psr b1913 + 16 ; for example , the predicted relativistic periastron advance is 169  yr@xmath33 , more than four times the value for psr b1913 + 16 .",
    "added to that , the orbit is seen within a degree or so of edge - on , not only allowing detailed measurement of the shapiro delay , but also resulting in eclipses of the a pulsar emission by the magnetosphere of the b pulsar . finally , the still - unique detection of the second neutron star as a pulsar allows a direct measurement of the mass ratio of the two stars from the ratio of the two non - relativistic roemer delays ( @xmath68 ) .",

    "gws passing over the pulsars produce uncorrelated residuals because of both the retarded time and the different gw environment for each pulsar .",
    "also the pulsars themselves have uncorrelated timing noise at some level , either intrinsic or resulting from uncorrected variations in interstellar delays . because the expected gw strain is so weak , only msps have sufficient timing precision to make gw detection with ptas feasible .    for an isolated source of continuous gws ,",
    "say an smbh binary system in a nearby galaxy , in principle , both the earth term and and the pulsar term in equation  [ eq : gwz ] could be detected .",
    "for a rapidly evolving source , the pulsar term and the earth term may be at different frequencies because of the retarded time of the pulsar term ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",

    "as is discussed further in section  [ sec : future ] below , unfortunately we currently do nt know enough pulsar distances to sufficient accuracy to make this coherent addition possible . in a pta ,",
    "the pulsar terms therefore add with random phase , washing out the fringes in the antenna pattern ( see also ref .  ) and adding `` self - noise '' to the signal from the earth term . since the antenna pattern ( figure  [ fg : gw_ant ] ) has a maximum for pulsars roughly in the same direction as the gw source , the maximum response of a pta is toward the greatest concentration of pulsars in the array .",
    "a stochastic background of nanohertz gw from many smbh binary systems in distant galaxies is likely to be the signal first detected by ptas .",
    "to a first approximation , this background is also likely to be statistically isotropic , i.e. , the expectation value @xmath226 is independent of direction when averaged over typical data spans .",
    "hellings and downs@xcite were the first to show that , in this case , the correlation between gw - induced timing residuals for two pulsars separated by an angle @xmath87 on the sky is dependent only on @xmath87 and not on the sky positions of the two pulsars .",

    "@xmath229 goes negative for angular separations around @xmath230 and then positive again for pulsars that are more - or - less opposite on the sky  this is a direct consequence of the quadrupolar nature of gws .",
    "it is also important to note that the limiting value as @xmath231 is 0.5 , not 1.0 .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the pulsar terms in equation  [ eq : gwz ] are uncorrelated and , on average , of equal amplitude to the earth term .",
    "the scatter in the simulated correlations results from the random phases of the pulsar terms and illustrates the `` self - noise '' that limits the sensitivity of pta experiments in the strong - signal limit .",

    "when the binary separation is less than about 1  pc , loss of energy to gws becomes the dominant orbital decay mechanism and the binary system will ultimately coalesce , becoming a strong gw source as it spirals in .",
    "there remains much controversy about the efficiency of orbital decay mechanisms as the binary separation approaches a parsec  known as the `` last parsec problem '' .",
    "some ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) argue that dissipation mechanisms will quickly move the binary system through this phase , whereas others ( see , e.g. , ref .  )",

    "consequently the spectrum of the gwb is often parameterised as follows : @xmath256 where @xmath257 , @xmath258 is the characteristic strain at @xmath259 and @xmath260 for the case described above . for pulsar timing experiments , the one - sided power spectrum of the timing residuals",
    "is given by @xmath261 consequently , a gwb produces a very `` red '' modulation of the timing residuals with a spectral index of @xmath262 for @xmath260 .    in order to estimate the likely strength of this modulation",
    ", the factor @xmath245 in equation  [ eq : gwb ] must be evaluated .",

    "different approaches to this problem have been taken by different authors .",
    "an early paper by jaffe and backer@xcite used observational constraints on close galaxy pairs coupled with a black - hole mass function , whereas another early paper by wyithe and loeb@xcite used a prescription for merger of dark - matter halos coupled with different scenarios for growth of massive black holes in galaxies .",
    "the latter approach was developed further by sesana et al.@xcite who showed that the gwb spectrum steepens at frequencies above about @xmath263  hz since the number of binary systems contributing to the background at these frequencies becomes small .",
    "this is illustrated in the left panel of figure  [ fg : mbhb ] which shows that binary systems at @xmath264 contribute most of the strain to the gwb .",

    "importantly , at the high - mass end , only a few systems contribute to the gwb .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fg : gwb_spec ] , this leads to a steepening and large uncertainties in the expected gwb spectrum at frequencies @xmath267  hz .",
    "these results were confirmed and extended by sesana et al.@xcite and ravi et al.@xcite using the _ millenium _ simulation of the cosmological evolution of dark matter structures @xcite to define a merger history together with various prescriptions for galaxy and black - hole formation and growth .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "while there is some consensus about the form of the gwb spectrum , there remain significant uncertainties .",
    "for example , ravi et al.@xcite consider the effects of the stellar environment on the late evolution of massive black - hole binary systems in the cores of galaxies and conclude that the effect of dynamical friction is important , both in extracting energy from the binary system and inducing an eccentricity .",
    "both of these have the effect of reducing the strength of the predicted gwb , especially at the low - frequency end , consequently making its detection by ptas more difficult . on the other hand , mcwilliams",
    "et al.@xcite argue for a model in which all black - hole growth is by merger rather than by accretion after coalescence , which is the main contributor to black - hole growth in the models discussed above .",
    "this leads to predictions of a significantly larger gwb characteristic strain compared to previous predictions and , hence , the imminent detection of the gwb by ptas .        as figure  [ fg : gwb_spec ] indicates , there is a possibility that the nearby universe could contain a massive black - hole binary system with an orbital period of the order of a few years that actually dominates the nanohertz gw spectrum .",
    "this opens up the exciting prospect of the gw detection and study of an isolated supermassive black - hole binary system using pulsar timing and even the possibility of detection and study of the system in the electromagnetic bands ",
    "so - called `` multi - messenger '' astronomy .",
    "searches for binary gw sources will be described in  [ sec : pta ] and the prospects for their detailed study will be discussed in  [ sec : future ] .      cosmic strings and the related cosmic super - strings are one - dimensional topological defects which may have formed in phase transitions in the early universe .",
    "cosmic strings occur in standard field - theory inflation models , whereas superstrings are found in brane inflationary models .",
    "the idea that such strings will oscillate and hence emit gws was first proposed by vilenkin@xcite .",
    "such oscillations may contribute to the stochastic gwb ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) or generate bursts of gw radiation from string cusps and kinks ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",

    "other significant parameters for the gwb are the intrinsic spectral index @xmath269 of the gw emission , a characteristic node number @xmath270 for the high - frequency cutoff in the emission spectrum and the probability @xmath271 of `` intercommutation '' , that is , intersecting strings dividing and the two parts exchanging",
    ". such intercommutation can , for example , form two smaller loops from an intersecting twist in a larger loop . for standard strings , @xmath272 but it may be less for superstrings .    vibrating cosmic strings are likely to decay by emission of gws in a series of harmonics with fundamental frequency @xmath273 , where @xmath274 is the length of the loop , with an initial value @xmath275 , where @xmath276 is the horizon distance at the time of loop creation .",

    "such a burst is intense for just a few milliseconds and clearly can not be detected by pta experiments which typically are sensitive to signals of duration between a few weeks and a few years .",
    "possible sources of longer - duration bursts are coalescence of smbh binary systems , highly eccentric massive black - hole binary systems , and formation and decay of cusps and kinks in cosmic strings .",
    "a major difference between detection of gw bursts and continuous gw sources is that there is generally no interference between the earth term and the pulsar terms in the signal detected by ptas ( equation  [ eq : gwz ] ) .",
    "this is because the duration of the burst ( by definition , less than the observational data span ) is much less than the light - time to the pulsars and so , except for a source in the same direction as a pulsar , the burst will occur at very different times in the earth and pulsar terms .",
    "the pulsar term reflects the effect of the burst on the pulsar at a time @xmath285 _ before _ the burst arrives at the earth , but the pulsar term is detected at a time @xmath286 _ later _ than the earth term , where @xmath67 is the pulsar distance and @xmath87 is the angle between the pulsar and the gw propagation direction as seen from the earth .",

    "the amplitude of the memory effect is @xmath297 where @xmath298 is the mass fraction contributing to the memory effect and @xmath299 is the reduced mass fraction , 0.25 for equal - mass binary components @xcite .",

    "also , real pulsar glitches are generally spin - ups , whereas a gw - memory jump may be of either sign , depending on pulsar - source angle . therefore ,",

    "black - hole binary systems with circular orbits emit gw at the second harmonic of the orbital frequency , i.e. , @xmath302 . for eccentric orbits ,",
    "the gw emission becomes more burst - like as the accelerations and hence gw power are greatest around periastron when the two black holes are closest together @xcite . in the spectral domain ,",
    "power spreads to higher harmonics and also to the fundamental frequency @xmath303 . in the gravitational - decay phase of evolution ,",
    "when energy loss is dominated by gw emission , the orbit tends to circularise @xcite .",

    "finn and lommen@xcite have investigated the gw emission and the resulting timing residuals from a close parabolic encounter of two massive black holes . as figure  [ fg : gw_burst ] shows , an encounter of two @xmath304 black holes located at a distance of 15 mpc with a minimum separation of 0.02 pc produces a gw burst of duration about 1 year and maximum gw strain @xmath305 .",

    "similarly , a system with @xmath333  m@xmath1 at a distance of 400  mpc should be detectable .",
    "unfortunately , as figure  [ fg : gwcw_sky ] shows , the nearby galaxy clusters such as virgo , coma and fornax are all in regions of relatively low sensitivity for the _ ppta _ ( and other ptas ) , so the effective limits for these clusters are a factor of a few higher .",
    "it is unlikely that such massive binary systems exist in these clusters .",
    "more generally , limits can also be placed on the smbh binary coalescence rate in the nearby universe ( @xmath336 ) .",
    "based on the _ ppta _ results , zhu et al.@xcite place a 95% confidence limit of @xmath337  mpc@xmath338  gyr@xmath33 on the coalescence rate .",
    "this limit is about two orders of magnitude above current estimates of the galaxy merger rate in the local universe ( cf .",
    "ref .  ) .",
    "these rate estimates are based on the orientation - averaged and sky - averaged amplitudes .",
    "it is of course possible that a favourably oriented and located smbh binary system in the late stages of coalescence could exist . on the other hand ,",
    "the estimates are based on circular binary orbits and , as discussed in sections  [ sec : gwb ] and [ sec : gw_trans ] above , short - period smbh binaries may have significant eccentricity which reduces the gw power at the fundamental frequency @xmath302 and hence the detectability of such systems . on balance",
    ", it seems unlikely that gw from an individual coalescing smbh binary system will be detected with the current generation of ptas .",
    "ptas have now achieved data spans and toa precisions that would allow detection of the gwb predicted by some models for the evolution of galaxies and the smbhs at their core ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) . up to now , no detections have been made .",
    "while this is disappointing from the point of view of gw astrophysics , it is starting to have important implications for galaxy and smbh evolution models and to rule out some scenarios .",
    "it also implies that ptas are close to detecting the gwb if current predictions for its amplitude are correct .",
    "siemens et al.@xcite have considered the sensitivity of an idealised pta to a gwb . at low signal levels , when the lowest signal frequencies are below the white noise level , the detection signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) is @xmath339 where @xmath91 is the number of pulsars in the array , @xmath92 is the observing cadence ( frequency of observations ) , @xmath258 is the gwb amplitude ( equation  [ eq : gwb_spec ] ) , @xmath340 is the rms level of the white timing noise , @xmath25 is the observing data span and @xmath124 is the inverse spectral index of the gwb signal in the timing residuals , taken to be @xmath341 ( equation  [ eq : gwb_res ] ) . in the detection regime where the gwb signal exceeds the white noise level , the s / n is @xmath342 consequently , in the pre - detection regime , the s / n increases rapidly with increased observing cadence and data span and decreased timing noise , but has a much weaker dependence on these parameters in the strong signal regime .",
    "the reason for this is that noise from the uncorrelated pulsar term , which is also proportional to @xmath258 , dominates over the white `` receiver '' noise , greatly modifying the statistical behaviour .",
    "importantly though , in both regimes , the s / n is proportional to @xmath91 , the number of pulsars in the pta .",
    "figure  [ fg : gwb_sens ] illustrates these dependencies for a range of plausible future ptas .",
    "as siemens et al.@xcite point out , if @xmath343 , current ptas are already in the `` strong signal '' regime .",
    "this means that increasing the observing data spans and cadence or decreasing toa uncertainties has limited effect on the s / n of a potential detection .",
    "increasing the number of pulsars in the pta is a much more cost - effective way to increase detection sensitivity .",
    "this fact provides much of the motivation to combine data from existing ptas to form the international pulsar timing array ( _ ipta _ ) . in the future , the chinese _",
    "fast _ radio telescope @xcite and the _ ska _ @xcite will provide a large increase in radiometer sensitivity compared to existing instruments .",
    "the discussion above shows that this increased sensitivity will be best employed in increasing the number of ( weaker ) pulsars that are timed , rather than improving the toa precision on the stronger existing pta pulsars .",
    "considerations of `` jitter noise '' in toas resulting from shape variations in individual pulses @xcite lead to the same conclusion .",
    "while direct detection of the gwb would be enormously exciting and significant , there is no doubt that direct detection of gw from individual smbh binary systems is potentially much more interesting from an astrophysical perspective .",
    "it opens up the possibility of identifying a gw source with source or region identified through electromagnetic - wave ( radio , optical , x - ray or @xmath47-ray ) emission and the advent of `` multi - messenger '' astronomy ( e.g. , refs  ) .",
    "for example , many active galactic nuclei ( agns ) show evidence of a close binary smbh at their core . examples of this include x - shaped radio lobes ( e.g. , ref .  ) , double - peaked or variable emission lines from the core region ( e.g. , ref .  ) , quasi - periodic modulation of core radio ( e.g. , ref .  ) or x - ray emission ( e.g. , ref .  ) , and direct imaging of double agn ( e.g. , ref .  ) .    with one exception , existing pta systems do not have sufficient sensitivity to detect these potential gw sources .",
    "the exception is the claimed smbh binary system identified by vlbi astrometry of the nearby quasar 3c",
    "66b @xcite which was effectively ruled out by pulsar timing observations @xcite .",
    "future ptas including _ fast _ and the _ ska _ will have much increased sensitivity , making searches for other gw candidate sources potentially more productive .",
    "similarly , although blind searches for continuous - wave gw signals in current pta data sets have a low probability of successful detection , in future this should not be the case .",
    "the possibility of identification of a source galaxy or agn then depends critically on the accuracy of the position determination for the gw source . when only detection of the `` earth term '' is considered , the accuracy is at best many tens of square degrees ( e.g. , ref .  ) containing thousands if not millions of galaxies .",
    "only a correlation of the gw signal with a modulation of some property of a galaxy core ( e.g. , intensity or velocity ) would establish an identification .",
    "the situation changes dramatically if the pulsar terms can be added coherently with the earth term ( cf .",
    "equation  [ eq : gwz ] ) .",
    "each earth  pulsar system then forms an interferometer with baseline @xmath67 and fringe spacing @xmath344 $ ] , where @xmath67 is the pulsar distance , @xmath345 is the gw wavelength and @xmath47 is the direction cosine between the pulsar direction and the gw propagation direction @xcite .",
    "positional accuracies are roughly the fringe spacing divided by the s / n of the gw detection . since @xmath67 is typically @xmath346 light - years and @xmath345 is a few light - years , sub - arc - minute positional accuracies are possible for the stronger sources .",
    "however , to achieve the coherent summation , the distance to the pulsars must be known to better than @xmath347 , i.e. , about 1  pc unless the gw source is nearly aligned with the pulsar .",
    "currently , only one pta pulsar , psr j0437@xmath204715 , has a distance known to this accuracy , measured through vlbi astrometry @xcite , but in the _ ska _ era this will change . as boyle and pen@xcite point out , with a high density of pta pulsars on the sky , advantage can be taken of the @xmath219 factor and so pulsars with less precisely determined distances located in the general direction of the gw source could be useful .",
    "in this situation , ptas would not be confusion - limited and , in principle , many individual gw sources could be identified . with a high enough number of pta pulsars ( say 1000 or more ) it may be possible to localise a binary gw source by the quadrupolar pattern of timing residuals in pulsars surrounding the source , even if the pulsar distances are poorly determined .",
    "nature has been very kind in providing us with a set of near - perfect celestial clocks , many in situations of rapidly varying gravitational accelerations . not only are these celestial clocks , known as pulsars , precise time - keepers , they are also exceedingly compact .",
    "this enables them to be treated as point masses in theoretical analyses of their motion and also permits tests in the regime of strong gravitational fields .",
    "these qualities result in a very wide range of applications for pulsar time - keeping , most importantly , at least in the context of this review , to investigations of relativistic gravitation .",
    "observations of double - neutron - star systems , wide circular pulsar  white - dwarf systems and even isolated pulsars have been used to test the accuracy of gravitational theories .",
    "remarkably , general relativity ( gr ) is unscathed by all of these tests and hence remains the most viable theory of gravitation .",
    "pulsar timing has provided the strongest available limits on at least six parameters describing deviations from gr . continued and improved pulsar timing measurements , especially with new and highly sensitive radio telescopes such as _ fast _ and the _ ska _ , will both improve on these limits and enable new and different tests of relativistic gravity .",
    "they may even demonstrate a failure of gr to adequately account for the observations , leading to new or modified theories of gravitation .",
    "continuing and new searches for previously unknown pulsars , especially with _ fast _ and the _ ska _ , will not only increase the number of pulsars that can be used in tests of relativistic gravity .",
    "they will also turn up new and exciting classes of object such as the recently discovered triple system , psr j0337 + 1715 .",
    "such discoveries enrich the investigations of relativistic astrophysics that can be undertaken with pulsars .",
    "one of the outstanding goals of current astronomy and astrophysics is the direct detection and study of gravitational waves ( gws ) .",
    "pulsar timing arrays ( ptas ) provide a viable mechanism for detection of gws with frequencies in the nanohertz range .",
    "they therefore complement other existing or planned instruments such as the laser - interferometer systems _ ligo _ and _ elisa _ which are sensitive to gws at frequencies of around 100  hz and millihertz respectively .",
    "the most probable sources for gw detection by ptas are binary super - massive black holes in the cores of distant galaxies .",
    "these produce an unresolved background of gws that is potentially detectable , but there may also be individual binary systems that could be detected by ptas .",
    "there are currently three major ptas operating , one each in europe ( _ epta _ ) , north america ( _ nanograv _ ) and australia ( _ ppta _ ) . up to now , no gws have been detected by ptas ( or other gw detection systems ) so the direct detection of gws remains a goal .",
    "however , recent limits on the gw background are placing significant constraints on existing models for galaxy mergers over cosmological time and the formation and evolution of super - massive black holes in the cores of these galaxies .",
    "for example , a model in which black - hole growth is dominated by mergers is essentially ruled out .    the sensitivity of ptas to gws is a function of several factors including the precision of the pulse arrival - time measurements , the data span of the pta observations and the cadence or frequency of observations within this data span .",
    "however the most important single factor is the number of pulsars in the pta .",
    "of course , these pulsars must meet certain timing - precision and period - stability criteria to usefully contribute to a pta .",
    "there are two main approaches to increasing the number of pulsars .",
    "first , existing data sets can be combined to form a single pta ",
    "this is the goal of the international pulsar timing array project .",
    "second , searches can be undertaken to increase the number of known pulsars suitable for pta projects . with _",
    "fast _ and the _ ska _ it is possible that hundreds of msps that are suitable for pta projects will be both discovered and subsequently timed to high precision .",
    "this will surely lead to the detection of gws and to detailed investigations of both the gws themselves and the sources that generate them .",

    "<S> pulsars are wonderful gravitational probes . </S>",
    "<S> their tiny size and stellar mass give their rotation periods a stability comparable to that of atomic frequency standards . </S>",
    "<S> this is especially true of the rapidly rotating `` millisecond pulsars '' ( msps ) . </S>",
    "<S> many of these rapidly rotating pulsars are in orbit with another star , allowing pulsar timing to probe relativistic perturbations to the orbital motion . </S>",
    "<S> pulsars have provided the most stringent tests of theories of relativistic gravitation , especially in the strong - field regime , and have shown that einstein s general theory of relativity is an accurate description of the observed motions . </S>",
    "<S> many other gravitational theories are effectively ruled out or at least severely constrained by these results . </S>",
    "<S> msps can also be used to form a `` pulsar timing array '' ( pta ) . </S>",
    "<S> ptas are galactic - scale interferometers that have the potential to directly detect nanohertz gravitational waves from astrophysical sources . </S>",
    "<S> orbiting super - massive black holes in the cores of distant galaxies are the sources most likely to be detectable . </S>",
    "<S> although no evidence for gravitational waves has yet been found in pta data sets , the latest limits are seriously constraining current ideas on galaxy and black - hole evolution in the early universe . </S>"
