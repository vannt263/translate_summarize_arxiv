    "supernova explosions are one of the sites promoted for the production of light elements , li , be , and b , in galactic chemical evolution ( gce ) , in addition to the galactic cosmic rays ( gcrs ) , agb stars , and novae @xcite .",
    "they continuously provide @xmath2li and @xmath0b through the interactions of nuclei such as @xmath5he and @xmath6c with neutrinos emitted from a proto - neutron star .",
    "this synthesis process is called the @xmath1-process @xcite .",
    "overproduction of @xmath0b in supernovae is one of the standing problems in supernova nucleosynthesis and the gce ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "previous works have indicated that the supernova contribution of @xmath0b production evaluated from supernova nucleosynthesis models @xcite is too large by a factor of 2.5 @xmath7 5.6 to reproduce the gce of the light elements ; the factor depends on models of the gce @xcite .",
    "most supernova nucleosynthesis calculations were carried out with a total neutrino energy of @xmath8 ergs and temperature of 8 mev for @xmath3 and @xmath4 and 4 mev for @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the supernova explosion mechanism has not been resolved , so the characteristics of the supernova neutrinos , especially their energy spectra , have not been fully determined @xcite .",
    "therefore , the light element amounts have not been obtained from a specific neutrino model precisely determined by supernova explosion models .",
    "therefore , we systematically investigate the dependence of the light element synthesis in supernova explosions on the supernova neutrinos .",
    "furthermore , on the basis of the evaluated dependence and the results of the gce of the light elements , we restrict the characteristics of the supernova neutrinos , such as their energy spectra .",
    "the neutrino luminosity is assumed to decrease exponentially with a decay time of @xmath11 s as in @xcite .",
    "the luminosity is equally divided into each favor of neutrinos .",
    "the neutrino energy spectra are assumed to obey fermi distribution with zero chemical potential .",
    "we set the temperature of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , @xmath12 , and the total neutrino energy @xmath13 as parameters .",
    "the ranges of @xmath12 and @xmath13 are 4.0 mev @xmath14 9.0 mev and @xmath15 ergs @xmath16 ergs .",
    "these ranges include the neutrino temperatures adopted in previous studies @xcite and the total neutrino energy range ( @xmath17 ergs @xmath18 ergs ) deduced from the gravitational energy of a @xmath7 1.4 @xmath19 neutron star @xcite . for the temperatures of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , we choose 3.2 mev and 5.0 mev @xcite . with these neutrino temperatures , a successful @xmath20-process abundance pattern ,",
    "an appropriate third - to - second peak ratio , has been obtained using a neutrino - driven wind model @xcite .",
    "the supernova explosion is pursued using a spherically symmetrical lagrangian ppm code with 13 element @xmath21-particle nuclear reaction network for energy generation @xcite .",
    "the presupernova structure is adopted from a 16.2 @xmath19 star corresponding to sn 1987a @xcite .",
    "the explosion energy is set to be @xmath22 ergs and the mass cut is set to be 1.6 @xmath19 .",
    "detailed nucleosynthesis of the supernova explosion is calculated by postprocessing .",
    "the nuclear reaction network consists of 291 species of nuclei @xcite .",

    ", width=287 ]    figure 1 shows mass fraction distribution of light elements in the supernova ejecta .",
    "the light elements are mainly produced in the he / c layer and smaller amounts are in the inner o rich layer .",
    "we have shown that @xmath2li and @xmath0b are produced through the @xmath1-process reactions : @xmath5he(@xmath24h , @xmath5he(@xmath25he and @xmath21-captures in the he layer and @xmath6c(@xmath26b in the inner o rich layer @xcite .",
    "they are partly destroyed by the capture of @xmath21-particles .",
    "the ejected mass of @xmath0b as a function of the temperature of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , @xmath12 , is shown in fig .",
    "the dependence of @xmath12 on the ejected mass is stronger than linear .",
    "since the ejected mass is roughly proportional to @xmath13 @xcite , the dependence of @xmath12 is stronger than the @xmath13 dependence .",
    "this is because the dependence on the cross sections of the @xmath1-process is larger than a linear dependence .",
    "the @xmath0b ejected mass in the case of @xmath27 ergs and @xmath12 = 8 mev is consistent with that in @xcite in spite of different values of @xmath28 and @xmath29 . since @xmath28 and @xmath29 are smaller than @xmath12 and neutral current interactions are important for the @xmath1-process of the light elements , the difference of @xmath28 and @xmath29 from @xcite scarcely affects the ejected masses of the light elements @xcite .",
    "we will apply the above results to gce of the light elements .",
    "recent studies of the gce have indicated that both gcrs and supernovae contribute to the b production : @xmath30b is produced through the gcrs and @xmath0b is produced through the gcrs and sne . in order to reproduce meteoritic @xmath0b/@xmath30b ratio ( = 4.05 ) at solar metallicity , the supernova contribution of @xmath0b is important since the @xmath0b/@xmath30b ratio of the gcrs is 2.5 @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath0b is overproduced in sn nucleosynthesis models @xcite compared to the evaluation of the gce .",
    "prior evaluations of the gce of the light elements give the overproduction factor @xmath31 to be 0.18 @xcite , 0.28 @xcite , and 0.40 @xcite .",
    "thus , we set the range of the factor appropriate for the @xmath0b amount in gce to be @xmath32 as in @xcite .",
    "the corresponding range of the @xmath0b ejected mass is @xmath33 ( two horizontal lines of fig .",
    "2 ) . we also restrict @xmath13 to be the gravitational energy of a typical neutron star ( see  2 ) @xcite .",
    "finally , we obtain a shaded region satisfying both of the conditions of the @xmath0b mass and @xmath13 ( see fig .",
    "the obtained range of @xmath12 is @xmath34 , which is smaller than 8 mev in @xcite .",
    "our evaluation is carried out only in the case of sn 1987a , which corresponds to about 20 @xmath19 star in zams stage . for @xmath0b production ,",
    "the @xmath1-process reactions of @xmath5he in the he layer and @xmath6c in the o layer are important .",
    "it depends on the progenitor mass models which layer is more important .",
    "fortunately , however , the neutrino temperature dependence does not change strongly in either @xmath1-process reactions .",
    "thus , the appropriate range of the neutrino temperature would be a good approximation for supernovae with different progenitor masses .",
    "the investigation of the dependence of the @xmath0b production on the neutrinos spectra for different progenitor mass is a future subject .",
    "we briefly discuss the effect of non - zero chemical potential of the supernova neutrinos .",
    "detailed discussion is written in @xcite .",
    "recent studies on the neutrino transfer during supernova explosions have indicated that the energy spectra of the supernova neutrinos approximately obey `` pinched  fermi - dirac distribution rather than that with zero chemical potential @xcite .",
    "in such a case , it is expected that the ejected masses of the light elements change since reaction rates of the @xmath1-process change .",
    "hartmann et al .",
    "@xcite discussed the effect of non - zero chemical potential assuming that cross sections of the @xmath1-process are proportional to the square of the neutrino energy .",
    "we generalize their discussion : we approximate the cross sections of the @xmath1-process to the @xmath21th power low of the neutrino energy .",
    "then , we evaluate the effect on the reaction rates of the @xmath1-process .",
    "the reaction rates of the @xmath1-process can be written as a function of the degeneration factor @xmath35 for given @xmath21 and the neutrino temperature @xmath12 , and increase by a factor of 1.4 @xmath7 1.5 in the case of @xmath36 and of the @xmath21 range @xmath37 compared to that with @xmath38",
    ". since the ejected masses of @xmath0b and @xmath2li are roughly proportional to the @xmath1-process reaction rates , they increase with the same factor . in this effect , the neutrino temperature range appropriate for the @xmath0b amount in gce should decrease in the case of non - zero chemical potential . in the case of @xmath36 ,",
    "this range decreases by 10% at most",
