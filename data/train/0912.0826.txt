    "models of low - scale gravity  @xcite allow for the production of small black holes in particle collisions  @xcite .",
    "the available energy must be well above the fundamental planck scale for the semiclassical description of black hole production and decay to be valid .",
    "based on current experimental and phenomenological limits on the planck scale  @xcite , it is unlikely that semiclassical black holes will be accessible at energies produced by the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "however , if the planck scale is low enough , quantum black holes may be produced in abundance at the lhc  @xcite .    in spite of not having a complete theory of quantum gravity , it is still possible to gain insight into the signatures of quantum black holes at the lhc based on some fundamental principles and a few assumptions  @xcite .",
    "the current thinking is that a black hole is formed if two partons from a proton - proton collision at the lhc satisfy the hoop conjecture  @xcite .",
    "it is natural for the local gauge symmetries of qcd colour and electric charge to be conserved during the black hole formation and decay processes  @xcite .",
    "the black hole thus inherits the colour , charge , and angular momentum from the parton pair that formed it .",
    "hence , black holes can be characterized by qcd colour , electric charge , and angular momentum at the lhc .",
    "quantum black holes are expected to differ from semiclassical black holes in a number of ways .",
    "semiclassical black holes are thought to decay thermally at the hawking temperature and be well described by black hole thermodynamics . in this canonical formalism , the back - reaction on the spacetime during decay is negligible .",
    "however , as the black hole mass approaches the planck scale , the back - reaction will become significant and the black hole can no longer be considered in thermal equilibrium with its radiation .",
    "microcanonical corrections can help improve the decay description until quantum mechanical effects take over .",
    "when the compton wavelength of the black hole becomes larger than the schwarzschild radius , quantum effects may impart some particle characteristics onto the black hole . at this point in the decay",
    "it is difficult to view the black hole as still having a well defined temperature and any significant entropy .",
    "thus it is unlikely that quantum black holes produced near threshold will decay thermally  @xcite .",
    "we will consider black holes produced with mass just above the planck scale . in this regime , it is unlikely that the decays will be thermal , and we might expect quantum black hole decays into only a few - particle final states to dominate .",
    "the formation and decay will occur over a small region of spacetime , and the quantum black hole might be viewed as a strongly coupled resonance or a gravitationally bound state . since the production and decay are short - distance processes , and the quantum black hole is likely to have colour , the qcd hadronization process would occur after the decay .    with this simplified picture of quantum black hole production and decay , we perform a study of the decay signatures that might be expected at the lhc .",
    "our work builds on ref .",
    "@xcite where these ideas , to our knowledge , were first discussed .",
    "we explicitly consider only add type black holes .",
    "however , there is a range of mass scales for which almost flat five - dimensional space is an applicable metric for randall - sundrum type-1 black holes .",
    "some novel signatures that do not often occur in other beyond the standard model physics scenarios will be examined .",
    "another unique feature is that , if black holes are produced , these signatures will occur at huge rates when compared to , even , standard model processes .",
    "we reminded the reader that there are inevitable limitations in any model of quantum black holes since this is precisely the regime in which gravity becomes strongly coupled and the theory is no longer perturbative .",
    "thus our seemly predictive results should be viewed as a dimensional analysis in which it is hope that some of the extrapolations from the classical domain will carry over to quantum black holes .",
    "with the startup of the lhc , such phenomenological studies are of interest and of value .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in sec .",

    "quantum black holes can be classified according to their @xmath0 and @xmath1 representations .",
    "since we are considering proton - proton collisions , the allowed particles forming the black hole are quarks , antiquarks , and gluons .",
    "nine possible electric charge states can be formed : @xmath2 .",
    "the 4/3 charge state can only be formed by quark pairs .",
    "the 2/3 charge state can be formed either by an antiquark - antiquark pair or a quark - gluon combination .",
    "the 1/3 charge state can be formed either by a quark - quark pair or an antiquark - gluon combination .",
    "the 1 charge state can only be formed by a quark - antiquark pair , and the 0 charge state can be formed by a quark - antiquark pair or a gluon - gluon pair . the composition of the black hole negative charge states can be enumerated similarly .",
    "the possible colour states of two partons are    @xmath3    since black holes form representations of @xmath0 , they are predominantly coloured , but can occur as colourless singlets .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] lists the possible charge and colour state combinations that could be produced .",
    "these states are not unique to quantum black holes but also apply to semiclassical black holes formed by two - parton collisions .",
    ".[tab1]possible quantum black hole states of different electric charge ( superscript ) and colour representation ( subscript ) . for the electric charge states ,",
    "there are a corresponding 10 states of opposite electric charge and `` opposite '' colour representation which are not shown .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     at energies of the fundamental planck scale @xmath4 , the size in spacetime of the incoming partons and the gravitational radius @xmath5 of the black hole are both of order @xmath6",
    ". since the impact parameter is of the same size as the gravitational radius , the angular momentum of the two - particle system , @xmath7 , would be of order unity .",
    "thus , a possible semiclassical black hole spin - down process is unlikely to apply to quantum black holes .",
    "this statement relies on the hoop conjecture of classical gravity being applicable in the strong gravity regime .    for simplicity",
    ", we will consider the initial angular momentum of the quantum black hole to be due entirely to the spin states of the incoming partons , and ignore the possibility of an initial small orbital angular momentum due to an impact parameter .",
    "the procedure outline here can be used to include black holes with orbital angular momentum in the future , if desired .",
    "when considering spin states , we will assume massless partons .",
    "since we are ignoring angular momentum ( transverse to the helicity axis ) , the quantum black hole spin will be parallel to the parton helicity axis , or the beam axis at the lhc .",
    "this is quite different from semiclassical black holes with angular momentum . in this case , the convention is to add the small amount of spin angular momentum to the normally larger orbital angular momentum , which is transverse to the helicity axis  @xcite .",
    "the quark - quark states can form spin-0 and spin-1 quantum black holes .",
    "the spin-1 state is three times more likely to form than the spin-0 state .",
    "the quark - gluon states can form spin-3/2 and spin-1/2 quantum black holes . however , because the partons are massless , not all spin combinations are possible .",
    "the spin-3/2 state is twice as likely to form as the spin-1/2 state .",
    "the gluon - gluon states can form spin-0 , spin-1 , and spin-2 quantum black holes . again because the partons are massless , not all spin combinations are possible .",
    "there are no @xmath8 states along the spin axis in the spin-2 case .",
    "the relative spin-2 , spin-1 , and spin-0 probabilities in gluon - gluon collisions are 7:3:2",
    ". it may well be that charge , colour , and spin are not totally independent .",
    "the over all wave function of the two parton system may have to be symmetric or antisymmetric under interchange of two identical quarks or gluon , respectively .",
    "the cross section for black hole production is not known .",
    "based on classical arguments and only one available scale , the cross section is most often taken to be the geometrical cross section @xmath9 , where @xmath5 is the gravitational radius of the two - particle system ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "this cross section assumes a radiationless production process in which all the energy of the two - particle system goes into forming the black hole .",
    "various calculations have been performed to predict the amount of gravitational radiation in the production process , but for higher - dimensional gravity only the trapped surface approach has yielded numerical results  @xcite .",
    "the effect of radiation on the cross section is smallest for low black hole masses  @xcite . for the quantum black holes that we will consider , the trapped surface cross section is about 50 time less than the geometrical cross section .",
    "however , for higher - dimensions and non - zero impact parameter , these calculations can only be considered as lower bounds on the cross section . in addition , the calculations have ignored parton charge , parton spin , and parton finite size ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for progress in these areas ) .",
    "the calculations are based on classical arguments , and since it is not known how applicable these might be in the quantum regime , we will not consider them except for to realized that the cross sections might be lower by as much as about two orders of magnitude .",
    "arguments have been made for why the geometrical cross section , to within a small numerical coefficient , should be applicable to quantum black holes  @xcite . alternatively ,",
    "if one embeds a quantum theory of gravity into string theory , the cross section is reduced due to the quantum size of the string  @xcite .",
    "the energy threshold for quantum black hole production would be somewhat larger than @xmath4 by a factor that depends on the ratio of string length to planck length , or the string coupling in weakly - coupled string theory .",
    "the amount of reduction in the cross section will remain unknown until these fundamental constants have been determined .",
    "we assume the production cross section for quantum black holes can be extrapolated from the cross section for semiclassical black holes .",
    "it is a challenge for the experiments to measure or set a limit on the black hole cross section .",
    "this might be one of the few numerical quantities the experiments can address in an almost model independent way .",
    "the gravitational radius @xmath5 of a quantum black hole of mass @xmath10 becomes    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the total number of spacetime dimensions , and @xmath13 is a numerical coefficient depending only on the number of dimensions and the definition of the fundamental planck scale ; the pdg definition of the planck scale is used in this study :    @xmath14    we now address the question of over what mass range is a black hole a quantum object ?",
    "it is common to take the validity of the semiclassical black hole to be when the compton wavelength of the colliding particles lies within the gravitational radius .",
    "we turn this condition around and consider it to be the upper mass bound for considering the black hole to be in the quantum regime . with this mass restriction",
    ", we stay away from the semiclassical regime , where black hole thermodynamics and thermal decays occur .",
    "this bound also ensure that the initial angular momentum of the quantum black hole is close to unity .",
    "if we do not take the upper mass requirement into account , the tails of distributions ( particle momentum , for example ) might be artificially altered due to semiclassical black hole decays .",
    "we consider the lower mass , or threshold , to be when the mass of the black hole is equal to the inverse of its radius .",
    "using the pdg convention for the planck scale gives    @xmath15    we notice that the minimum mass is below the fundamental planck scale .",
    "this is an artifact of the definition of the planck scale .",
    "using the more intuitive dimopoulos - landsberg definition of the planck scale gives a minimum mass always above the fundamental planck scale . on the other hand ,",
    "the accelerator experiments have set limits on @xmath4 of @xmath16  tev , and hence a quantum back hole would be require to have mass above only about 500  gev . if @xmath4 is about 1  tev , could it be that the tevatron has failed to observe the effects of relatively low - mass black holes ? assuming this is not the case",
    ", we will take the threshold for quantum black hole production to be the planck scale in the pdg definition , and consider a fixed mass range for all dimensions : @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the maximum mass is lower than that indicated by eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) , but it is the lowest common choice where semiclassical approximations are expected to break down , and thus represents a very conservative maximum mass for our model .",
    "only a fraction of the total centre - of - mass energy @xmath19 in a proton - proton collision is available in the hard scattering process .",
    "we define @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the fractional energies of the two partons relative to the proton energies . the full particle - level cross section @xmath23 is given by    @xmath24    where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the parton types in the two protons , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) for the proton .",
    "the sum is over all the possible quark and gluon pairings that can make a particular quantum black hole state .",
    "the parton distributions fall rapidly at high relative energies , and so the particle - level cross section also falls at high energies .",
    "when describing quantum black hole production , it will be more informative to specify the two partons p@xmath29 and p@xmath30 that went into the formation of the black hole , and drop the colour representation specifier by summing over the possible colour representations .",
    "this makes sense since the partons hadronize after the quantum black hole decays .",
    "the relative probabilities of each colour representation will be accounted for in the decay branching fractions .",
    "the resulting 14 different processes can be used to obtained any desired inclusive result by multiplying the cross section by the branching fraction and summing the relevant processes .    to obtain numerical results",

    "thus the shape of the cross section at the lowest possible masses is almost independent of the parton cross section and is determined predominantly by the parton distribution functions .",

    "the concept of a quantum black hole state still has the useful purpose of labeling the possible interactions .    in the decays of quantum black holes ,",
    "one expects the number of particles in the final state to be small .",
