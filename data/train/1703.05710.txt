    "<S> we propose the universal approach to describe spreading widths of monopole , dipole and quadrupole giant resonances in heavy and superheavy spherical nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is based on the ideas of the random matrix distribution of the coupling between one - phonon and two - phonon states generated in the random phase approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we use the skyrme interaction sly4 as our model hamiltonian to create a single - particle spectrum and to analyze excited states of the doubly magic nuclei @xmath0sn , @xmath1pb and @xmath2126 . </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrate that the universal approach enables to describe gross structure of the spreading widths of the considered giant resonances .    </S>",
    "<S> damping of collective motion in finite many - body quantum systems is among topical subjects in mesoscopic physics . </S>",
    "<S> the question of how , for example , multipole giant resonances  ( grs ) in nuclei  @xcite and metal clusters  @xcite dissolve their energy is still not well understood . </S>",
    "<S> there is , however , a consensus of opinion that , in particular , in a nucleus , once excited by an external field , a gr progresses to a fully equilibrated system via direct particle emission and by coupling to more complicated states produced by the intrinsic motion of nucleons ( see , for example , ref.@xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the former mechanism gives rise to escape width @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> it is expected that the decay evolution along the hierarchy of more complex configurations till compound states determines spreading width @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> a full description of this decay represents a fundamental problem which is , however , difficult to solve ( if even is possible at all ? ) due to existence of many degrees of freedom .    </S>",
    "<S> in general , the description of spreading width in mesoscopic systems is based on the study of the electromagnetic strength distribution ( strength function )  @xcite in some energy interval . </S>",
    "<S> this interval should be large enough to catch hold of basic features of a gr under investigation . </S>",
    "<S> note , that in deformed systems the experimental widths are systematically larger and may develop a two- or three - peak structure . in this paper we consider only spherical nuclei in order to highlight a generic nature of the width @xmath4 in monopole , dipole and quadrupole resonances in heavy and super - heavy systems .    </S>",
    "<S> nuclear shell model may be used to analyse spreading widths of grs . </S>",
    "<S> however , the complexity of the calculations increases rapidly with the size of the configuration space . </S>",
    "<S> this fact severely restricts the feasibility of shell model calculations for heavy and super - heavy nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , even for a medium @xmath5ca isotope the state - of - art shell model calculations @xcite , which operate with the hamiltonian matrices of a huge dimension , produce questionable results for the dipole gr . </S>",
    "<S> although these calculations reproduce reasonably well its peak position and peak width , the enhancement of the classical thomas - reiche - kuhn sum rules is too overestimated . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the number of shell model studies , in particular , dipole grs in heavy and super - heavy nuclei are limited and rather focused on details of low - energy region ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the success of random matrix theory ( rmt )  @xcite , based on universal features in spectra of complex quantum systems , gives hope to shed light on the spectral properties and the distribution of transition - strength properties of grs , when specific details become not of a primary importance . </S>",
    "<S> as is well known , the rmt assumes only that a many - body hamiltonian belongs to an ensemble of random matrices that are consistent with the fundamental symmetries of the system such as parity , rotational , translational and time - reversal symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> we belive that it is quite suitable for our aim : to provide a generic principle for the decay of highly excited states with angular momentum and parity : @xmath6 . on the other hand , to understand the realistic fragmentation of high - lying states over complex configurations , observed as the spreading width , it is necessary also to exploit a realistic nuclear structure model . </S>",
    "<S> it should be based on the microscopic many - body theory , where the effects of the residual interaction on the statistics must be studied in large model spaces . introducing a residual interaction in general </S>",
    "<S> implies a transition to the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) -properties above some excitation energy  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , recent analysis of 151 experimental nuclear levels up to excitation energy of @xmath7 mev in @xmath1pb indicates already that the spectral properties are described by the goe due to a residual interaction , even though there is a small admixture of regular dynamics brought about by the low - lyings states @xcite .    the quasiparticle - phonon model ( qpm )  @xcite offers an attractive framework for such studies . </S>",
    "<S> we will use the modern development of the qpm , a finite rank separable approximation ( frsa )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> that approach employs the skyrme forces to calculate the single - particle  ( sp ) spectrum and the residual interaction in a self - consistent manner in order to avoid any artefacts  @xcite . as an example of the parameter set , </S>",
    "<S> we consider widely used sly4  @xcite which is adjusted to reproduce the nuclear matter properties , as well as nuclear charge radii , binding energies of doubly magic nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> this set shifts the island of stability towards high charge numbers around @xmath8126  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> evidently , another parameter set can be used as well for our purposes . </S>",
    "<S> the continuous part of the sp spectrum is discretized by diagonalizing the hartree - fock hamiltonian on a harmonic oscillator basis . </S>",
    "<S> the cut - off of the continuous part is at the energy of 100  mev .    </S>",
    "<S> the residual particle - hole interaction is obtained as the second derivative of the energy density functional with respect to the particle density . by means of the standard procedure  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the familiar equations of the random phase approximation ( rpa ) in the one particle - one hole ( 1p-1h ) configuration space . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenvalues of the rpa equations are found numerically as the roots of a relatively simple secular equation within the frsa  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> being a linear combination of 1p-1h states , the rpa solutions are treated as quasi - bosons with quantum numbers @xmath9 . among these solutions </S>",
    "<S> there are one - phonon states corresponding to collective grs and pure two - quasiparticle states . </S>",
    "<S> the configurations with various degree of complexity can be built by combining different one - phonon configurations @xmath10 of fixed quantum number @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> as a result , one obtains the n - phonon components @xmath11_{\\lambda^\\pi}$ ] of the wave function . </S>",
    "<S> the diagonalization of the model hamiltonian in the space of the one - phonon and complex configurations produces eigenstates of excited states . </S>",
    "<S> these states carry information on the fragmentation of one - phonon component over complex configurations in the resulting eigenfunction .    </S>",
    "<S> a natural question arises : what degree complexity of configuration should be enough in order to understand a gross structure of a particular gr which data are available in modern experiments ? </S>",
    "<S> in addition , once this complex configuration is defined one can further ask about statistical properties of states that compose a gr strength distribution .    in the actual calculations of the grs strength distributions in spherical nuclei @xmath0sn , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1pb and @xmath2126 considered as examples , we have included in our model space different multipoles @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> tentative estimates for the position of the resonance centroids @xmath13 and the spreading width @xmath4 have been defined by means of the energy - weighted moments @xmath14 : i ) @xmath15 ; ii ) @xmath16 ( see , for example , @xcite ) . note that the coefficient @xmath17 has its roots to the experimental definition of the width ( full width at half maximum ) related to the variance of the gaussian ( see , for example , @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> next , we construct various combinations @xmath18 to define the energy interval for location of the resonance width of fixed quantum number @xmath9 , taking 95% of the energy - weighted sum rule symmetrically around the centroid s position ( @xmath19 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is noteworthy that for all grs , considered in the present paper , the matrix elements for direct excitation of two - phonon components from the ground state are about two orders of magnitude smaller relative to ones for the excitation of one - phonon configurations . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the density of these complex configurations is much higher than the one - phonon ones and contributes essentially to statistics of the final states .    from our preliminary analysis of complex structure </S>",
    "<S> observed in the region of the isoscalar giant monopole resonance  ( isgmr ) with @xmath20 of the doubly magic nucleus @xmath1pb @xcite we have found that the spectrum can be explained as a result of mixing of one- and two - phonon components of the wave function , i.e. , @xmath21_{jm}\\biggr\\}\\mid 0\\rangle\\,,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the rpa excitation having energy @xmath23 ; @xmath24 denotes the total angular momentum and @xmath25 is its z - projection in the laboratory system .    in the case of the phonon - phonon coupling ( ppc ) </S>",
    "<S> the variational principle leads to a set of linear equations for the unknown amplitudes @xmath26 and @xmath27   ( see details in ref.@xcite ) : @xmath28 @xmath29 to resolve this set it is required to compute the coupling matrix elements @xmath30 _ { j } |0\\rangle\\ ] ] between one- and two - phonon configurations . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is similar to the particle - vibration coupling ( pvc ) model based on green s function method ( see for a recent review ref.@xcite ) that has been used in the study of the monopole @xcite and the quadrupole @xcite gr widths in @xmath1pb with the aid of skyrme forces . note , </S>",
    "<S> that the ppc includes as well the coupling of one - phonon state with two particle - two hole states , important in the pvc model , as a particular case ( see discussion in chapter 4.3 of the textbook @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> pb : ( a ) experimental @xmath31 strength distribution ; ( b ) the comparison of the results obtained by means of the microscopic ( dotted line ) and the random ( solid line ) coupling matrix elements between the one- and two - phonon configurations ; ( c ) @xmath31 strength distribution for one - phonon states ( dashed line ) and for the ppc case . </S>",
    "<S> the smoothing parameter 1 mev is used for the strength distribution described by the lorentzian function . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental data are taken from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ]    we start our discussion from the analysis of the spreading width of the isovector giant dipole resonance ( ivdgr ) in the spherical @xmath1pb nucleus , since it is the best known example of nuclear vibrations . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling ( the ppc ) of the one - phonon states with an intermediate complex background of two - phonon states yields a strong redistribution of the one - phonon dipole strength in the region of the ivdgr ( see fig.1c ) . </S>",
    "<S> it suppresses the high - lying one - phonon strength near @xmath32 mev ) and pushes this strength down ( see also @xcite ) . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain a reasonably well description of the dipole strength distribution over the resonance localization region ( compare figs.1a , b ) . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that the presence of two - phonon components in our wave function , in addition to the one - phonon ones , already enables us to describe the gross strength distribution of the typical dipole response in the heavy spherical nucleus @xmath1pb . </S>",
    "<S> similar conclusions have been drawn on the basis of shell - model calculations for the states above 8 mev in ref.@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the relatively broad realistic distribution seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] indicates that many two - phonon configurations contribute to the fragmentation process . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the rmt measures such as the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution ( nnsd ) and the spectral rigidity @xmath33 indicate a transition towards the goe when the coupling is switched on ( see figs.3,4 in @xcite for the isgmr ) . evidently , the extension of the wavefunction to more complex configurations would increase the fragmentation of the one - phonon strength over many excited states . </S>",
    "<S> this complexity suggests an approach from random matrix theory to describe the fragmentation of the transition strength between the rpa states and the ground state .    </S>",
    "<S> the coupling of the phonon states to more complex background states can be described by a simple doorway state hamiltonian ( cf ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) @xmath34 where @xmath35 describes the doorway states , @xmath36 the background states and @xmath37 the coupling between doorway states and background states . </S>",
    "<S> the rpa - phonon states constitute the doorway states , @xmath38 , and the background states are two - phonon and possibly more complex states , with eigenstates , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian @xmath41 represents a set of good quantum numbers , @xmath42 , and the rpa phonons as well as all background states fulfill these quantum numbers . </S>",
    "<S> we assume no coupling between different doorway states or between different background states , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , but all coupling takes place between the doorway states and the complex background states , @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> similar ideas have been discussed in @xcite where some limiting analytical estimates were obtained for the gdr strength function .    in our consideration </S>",
    "<S> the doorway states are taken from the microscopic rpa calculation for the isoscalar or isovector @xmath46 mode providing energies , @xmath47 , and transition matrix elements to the ground state ( @xmath48 ) , @xmath49 , via the transition operator @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> no transition can occur between a background state and the ground state , @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> after diagonalisation of the hamiltonian @xmath41 , the transition strength of the doorway states is fragmented on all states , and provides the full transition strength distribution .    </S>",
    "<S> the modelling of background states , @xmath52 , and couplings , @xmath53 , can be performed on different levels of approximation . in the ppc model , the background energies @xmath52 </S>",
    "<S> are obtained as the sum of two rpa phonon energies , @xmath54 , coupled to @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling matrix elements , @xmath53 , are subsequently obtained from eq.([cme ] ) . to account for underlying complexity we now replace these matrix elements by a random coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter that determines the strength of the coupling is the rms value of the matrix elements , @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> the actual distribution of the random interaction is not important , as long as it is symmetric , @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> while the microscopic matrix elements follow a truncated cauchy distribution , we chose a gaussian distribution for the random interaction , @xmath57 solutions of @xmath58 are ensemble averaged over the random interaction and give the transition strength distribution .    choosing the strength of the random interaction from the microscopic calculation of coupling matrix elements , that is the rms value , * @xmath59 * of the coupling matrix elements given by eq.([cme ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , we get the @xmath31 distribution strength of ivgdr for @xmath1pb as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]b . </S>",
    "<S> it is noteworthy that the comparison of the strength distributions obtained with the aid of the ppc and the random distribution of the matrix elements demonstrates a remarkable similarity ( see fig.1b ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , by means of the latter distribution ( [ rand ] ) we reproduce the experimental strength distribution of the ivgdr as well ( compare figs.1a , b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the rpa analysis provides the location of the isgmr in @xmath1pb in the energy region @xmath60  mev . </S>",
    "<S> the ppc yields a detectable redistribution of the isgmr strength in comparison with the rpa results . </S>",
    "<S> it results in the 1  mev downward shift of the main peak ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shows that the major contribution to the strength distribution is brought about by the coupling between the @xmath61_{rpa}$ ] and @xmath62_{rpa}$ ] components . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the use of the random matrix distribution yields the backshifting of this peak . </S>",
    "<S> evidently , in this case there is only an average strength that does not produce any preferences in the coupling between one- and two - phonon states of different one - phonon nature . </S>",
    "<S> the strength distribution of the isgmr obtained in this case is rather close to the experimental distribution  @xcite , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] .    , in the case of isgmr in @xmath1pb . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental data are taken from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ]    in the same manner we calculate and compare different estimations for the strength distribution of the grs in @xmath0sn and @xmath2126 nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the results of calculation and comparison with the experimental data and the empirical systematics are displayed in table  [ tab1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the description of the spreading width by means of the ppc and the random distribution ( [ rand ] ) provide similar results for the isgmr and ivgdr in all considered nuclei . for isoscalar giant quadrupole resonance ( isqgr ) </S>",
    "<S> the ppc yields the widths that are larger relative to the ones produced by the random distribution . </S>",
    "<S> it is required reliable experimental measurements in order to remove systematic uncertainties in experimental analysis based on optical potentials ( see also the discussion in ref.@xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> considering the interaction strength as a parameter , we investigate the complexity of the energy states in terms of the nnsd by studying the brody mixing parameter @xcite , @xmath63 , versus @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> a smooth increase is found from regularity ( @xmath65 ; poisson statistics ) when @xmath66 to chaos ( @xmath67 ; goe ) when @xmath68 , where the critical value , @xmath69 , depends on considered nucleus and kind of gr . </S>",
    "<S> it is remarkable that the onset of chaos appears at a @xmath64-value very similar to the interaction strength of the microscopic phonon coupling model . </S>",
    "<S> we thus find that @xmath70 for each considered case </S>",
    "<S> . a way to chose the strength of the random interaction may thus be to find the @xmath64 value where the goe properties appear , @xmath69 , ( practically defined as @xmath63=0.95 ) rather than performing the full microscopic ppc calculation .    </S>",
    "<S> while the nnsd provides information about correlations on short energy scales , the spectral - rigidity meassure @xmath71 characterises long - range correlations between the energy levels . for the coupling strength  @xmath72  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath73 full short - range goe correlations were found in the nnsd . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral rigidity @xmath33 only reproduces the goe distribution @xmath74 up to a @xmath75-value , @xmath76 . for the ivgdr of @xmath1pb </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath76=7 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies long - range goe correlations in the strength distribution around the centroid energy within an energy range of about @xmath77 mev , where @xmath78 is the density of background states . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , only correlations beyond this energy range may provide specific structure information . </S>",
    "<S> note , however , that the smoothing ( 1 mev ) smears out the strength effectively over more background states , not considered in the model . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the correlation energy obtained by means of @xmath76 expected to be larger .    </S>",
    "<S> since the energy spectrum shows full goe properties when the appropriate coupling strength has been included , another step in the doorway state model can be introduced . instead of calculating the background state energies with the aid of the rpa calculations </S>",
    "<S> , one might employ random goe - generated energies , following a smooth level density function of background states . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting strength distribution calculated in this way coincides perfectly with the case when microscopic background energies are included . </S>",
    "<S> this further simplifies the model , and provides possibilities to calculate spreading widths of giant resonances in a quite universal way .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in summary , we suggest the way to describe spreading widths of grs by including the coupling between one - phonon and two - phonon states . </S>",
    "<S> this coupling can be generated by means of the random distribution of coupling matrix elements ( [ rand ] ) , and the energies of the two - phonon states can be generated from the goe distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the variance of the gaussian function @xmath79 can be obtained from the goe limit of the nnsd of spectra generated by the coupling between one- and two - phonon states , characterised by the same quantum number @xmath46 . </S>"
