    "quantum phase transitions have attracted a significant amount of interest in recent years .",
    "there are different physical systems where quantum phase transitions can be studied , like in magnetic systems @xcite , the quantum hall effect @xcite , superconducting films @xcite and josephson junction arrays ( jja ) @xcite .",
    "there have been significant advances in lithographic techniques that allow the fabrication of arrays of ultra - small superconducting islands , with charging energy , @xmath1 , that can dominate the josephson coupling energy , @xmath0 , making quantum fluctuation effects of paramount importance @xcite . because the junction parameters can be controlled accurately jja",
    "offer a unique system where one can test the nature of quantum phase transitions and critical phenomena , in particular the superconductor  insulator ( si ) phase transition induced by quantum fluctuations .",
    "therefore jja can be a prototype system that can display well controlled quantum si phase transitions .",
    "in the jja problem , the two relevant low temperature energy scales are @xmath0 , that permits tunneling of cooper pairs between islands , and @xmath1 that tends to localize the charge carriers in the islands .",
    "when @xmath0 is much larger then @xmath1 the phases in the islands are well defined . in this regime",
    "only the phases determine the properties of the jja . in the opposite limit , i.e. @xmath4",
    "the superconducting phase is perturbed by strong zero point quantum fluctuations due to the coulomb blockade that localizes the charge carriers to the islands .",
    "several theoretical  @xcite and experimental studies  @xcite have considered the competition between the @xmath0 dominated phase and the @xmath5 dominated charging energy regions in periodic jja .",
    "it has been established that for sufficiently large charging energy the quantum phase fluctuations lead a complete suppression of long  range phase coherence even at zero temperature .",
    "this type of _ quantum phase transition _ has attracted significant interest in recent years ( for a review see ref . and also ) . generally , these transitions take place at zero temperature where crossing the phase boundary is accompanied by a change in the ground state of the system .",
    "this transition is induced at zero temperature by changing some external parameter in the hamiltonian of the system , for example the charging energy in the josephson - junction arrays ( given by the quantum parameter @xmath6 ) .",
    "let the critical temperature be @xmath7 and denote the distance from criticality as @xmath8 .",
    "the critical behavior is asymptotically close to the critical point which is entirely determined by classical physics .",
    "this is because the characteristic frequency associated with the critical fluctuations , @xmath9 , vanishes at criticality , and the characteristic correlation time for relaxation towards equilibrium @xmath10 diverges at the critical point ( here @xmath11 is the diverging characteristic correlation length in the system . ) a quantum system behaves classically if the temperature is larger than all frequencies of interest , i.e. as long as @xmath12 , which is always the case when the system is sufficiently close to the critical point with a non zero @xmath7 . in the critical region various physical quantities can have scaling forms ( i.e. given in terms of homogeneous functions ) as a consequence of the diverging @xmath13 and @xmath14 . since the experimentally accessible systems are necessarily at non - zero temperature , one needs to understand how the quantum behavior is modified at finite temperature .",
    "the important observation is that at finite temperature the partition function has a finite temporal dimension , since the effective classical system extends to an extra dimension of size @xmath15 .    at @xmath16 ,",
    "the 2d jja problem goes into a @xmath17dimensional classical xy model with the critical behavior of the 3d xy model .",
    "moreover , there should be a clear signature in the nature of the correlation functions ( like for example in linear response ) when crossing over from the 2d xy model at high temperatures to the 3d xy model as @xmath18 .",
    "specifically , the response of the quantum critical point to a small temperature perturbation will be determined by the location of the quantum  to  classical crossover .",
    "an especially interesting _ quantum critical regime _ appears when the relaxational frequency satisfies @xmath19 . in this regime",
    "the only relevant scale is given by the temperature and the dynamical scaling functions will only depend on the ratio @xmath20 .",
    "as the ratio @xmath20 is varied in an experiment we expect to see a crossover between temperature and frequency  dominated scaling regimes .",
    "for the finite temperature experiments one can scale the data by using the knowledge of the frequency dependent scaling functions to test the existence or probing of a quantum critical point .",
    "the experimental identification of a quantum phase transition in jja will rely upon finding the scaling behavior with the relevant parameters as temperature , frequency and the wavelength dependence of various observables .",
    "the specific signatures are given by universal values of certain dimensionless amplitudes as , for example , the resistivities at the critical point in 2d jja systems .",
    "motivated by these issues , it is the goal of the present paper to study the superconductor  insulator transition in 2d jja in the quantum critical regime , by focusing on the scaling properties of the directly measurable electromagnetic conductivities in jja systems .",
    "the outline of the rest of the paper is the following : in section ii we define the model hamiltonian , followed by a novel path integral formulation of the problem . in section",
    "iii we present as a test of our quantum spherical model approach for the self - capacitance model .",
    "there we show that the spherical technique gives a better answer than the one obtained from mean field theory . in section",
    "iv we present our calculation of the scaling properties of the conductivity in the quantum critical regime . finally , in section v we briefly discuss our results .",
    "a josephson junction array ( jja ) can be modeled by a periodic lattice of superconducting islands separated by insulating barriers . each island becomes independently superconducting about the bulk transition temperature @xmath21 and it is characterized by an order parameter @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a two  dimensional vector denoting the position of each island .",
    "the magnitude of the order parameter , @xmath24 , is non  fluctuating when the temperature is lowered further and the onset of long range phase coherence due to the tunneling of cooper pairs between the islands is responsible for the zero resistance drop in the arrays .",
    "the phase coherence onset temperature in jjas can be significantly reduced by making the junctions ultrasmall . when the junction s capacitance is small the charging energy ( i.e. the energy necessary to transfer cooper pair charges between the islands ) increases to the point where no pairs can tunnel anymore , completely quenching the josephson current .",
    "the competition between the josephson tunneling and the charging ( coulomb ) energy , without dissipation , can be modeled by the hamiltonian @xmath25_{{\\bf r}{\\bf r}'}{\\hat q}_{\\bf r}{\\hat q}_{{\\bf r } ' } , \\nonumber\\\\ h_j&&=\\sum_{\\langle { \\bf r}_1,{\\bf r}_2\\rangle } j(|{\\bf r}_1-{\\bf r } _",
