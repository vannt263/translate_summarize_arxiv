    "energy losses from heavy elements , such as tungsten , due to radiative emission are one of the crucial problems to be overcome for the successful performance of themonuclear reactors .",
    "nevertheless , tungsten is used as the plasma - facing component in the modern fusion facilities because of its essential properties , like high - energy threshold for sputtering , low sputtering yield , and excellent thermal features .",
    "even small concentration of tungsten ions ( @xmath8 ) relative to the electron density prevents ignition of a deuterium - tritium plasma @xcite .",
    "theoretical modeling provides information about processes in such harsh conditions .",
    "however , fusion plasma modeling requires a significant amount of atomic data .",
    "the ionization and recombination processes determine the charge - state distribution in plasma .",
    "the electron - impact single ionization is the strongest one among the ionization processes .",
    "contribution of the double ionization as a rule is much weaker compared with the single ionization .",
    "furthermore , study of the double ionization process is quite complicated @xcite .",
    "electron - impact ionization for singly charged tungsten ions was previously studied by using the crossed - beam technique @xcite .",
    "these data were supplemented by the electron - impact single , double , and triple ionization measurements of w@xmath9 ions in the charge states @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , respectively @xcite . the configuration - average distorted - wave ( cadw ) calculations provided good agreement with experimental measurements for higher ionization stages ( @xmath13 ) @xcite . the dw approach succeeded in getting a very good agreement with experiment for the ionization stages up to w@xmath14 ion and",
    "therefore it was applied to all isonuclear sequence @xcite .",
    "further level - to - level studies @xcite included w atom and w@xmath15 ion in the binary - encounter - dipole model as well as w@xmath16 and @xmath17 ions in the dw approach .",
    "for the tungsten isonuclear sequence , cross sections were calculated using semirelativistic and relativistic dw methods for configurations and subconfigurations , respectively @xcite .",
    "influence of the excitation - autoionization ( ea ) process , radiative damping , and relativistic effects were analyzed .",
    "the work of loch et al .",
    "@xcite considered the electron - impact excitations to all shells with @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the investigation has determined that the ea contribution is relatively small compared to direct ionization ( di ) for the w@xmath20 to w@xmath1 ions .",
    "however , later experimental measurements for the w@xmath21 ion have demonstrated a significant role of indirect process @xcite",
    ". theoretical study of cross sections using the dirac - fock - slater approach confirmed these findings @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the authors found that maxwellian rate coeffcients are larger than the cadw rate coefficients by about 16% .",
    "the discrepancy was attributed to the ea channels originating from the high-@xmath22 shells up to @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , the main aim of our work is to determine the influence of excitations to the high-@xmath22 shells which lead to the ea process . for the study",
    ", we have chosen the w@xmath1 ion which has only one @xmath24 electron in the valence shell . at first",
    ", we will present calculated results of the ea contribution for subconfigurations . later",
    ", level - to - level distorted - wave ( lldw ) data in a single configuration approach are analyzed .",
    "in addition , the influence of the radiative damping is studied in both cases .",
    "the contribution of the direct and indirect processes is compared for the w@xmath1 ion .",
    "direct and indirect processes contribute to the total electron - impact single - ionization cross sections from the level @xmath25 of @xmath26 ion to the level @xmath27 of @xmath28 ion : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the direct ionization cross section at the electron energy @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the electron - impact excitation cross section to the level @xmath33 of the @xmath26 ion .",
    "autoionization branching ratio @xmath34 is determined by the expression : @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the auger and radiative transition probabilities , respectively .",
    "therefore , inclusion of the branching ratios in the cross section calculations leads to the radiative damping of the indirect process .",
    "the second term in the numerator presents the transition from the level @xmath33 of the initial ion to the level @xmath27 of the final ion through the intermediate levels @xmath22 of the initial ion reached by the radiative transitions .",
    "this term is not studied in the current work because the amount of calculations drastically increases .",
    "thus , the indirect ionization consists of the two - step process : the excitation with subsequent autoionization .",
    "it is evident that the branching ratios for the levels below the ionization threshold are equal to zero .",
    "furthermore , the branching ratios are equal to zero for the levels above the ionization threshold if they can not decay through the auger transitions directly or through the intermediate states .",
    "the total ionization cross section for the initial level @xmath25 is obtained by performing summation over the all final levels @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) .",
    "we do not consider higher order indirect ionization process such as a resonant - excitation double - autoionization .",
    "previous analysis of this process for the w@xmath21 ion determined a negligible contribution for the ionization cross sections @xcite .",
    "the electron - impact excitation and ionization cross sections are determined in the dw approximation using the flexible atomic code ( fac ) @xcite which implements the dirac - fock - slater method . for moderate and highly charged ions ,",
    "the direct ionization is accurately described by the dw approximation .",
    "the ionization cross sections are calculated in the potential of the ionizing ion .",
    "calculations in the potential of the ionized ion provide approximately 10% smaller cross sections for the direct ionization .",
    "the ground configuration of the w@xmath1 ion is [ kr]@xmath38 which consists of two levels .",
    "our analysis of the ionization cross sections is based on the study of the ground level ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "cross sections from the first excited level ( @xmath40 ) are similar to the ones from the ground level and are not presented here .",
    "the lowest two configurations of the w@xmath1 ion together with the configurations which energy levels straddle the ionization threshold are shown in fig .",
    "[ energies ] .",
    "the presented configurations with the energy levels near the ionization threshold are produced by the one - electron promotions from the ground configuration of the w@xmath1 ion .",
    "they mainly correspond to the excitations from the @xmath41 shell up to the shells with @xmath42 .",
    "all of these configurations , except for the @xmath43 one , have average energies below the ionization threshold .",
    "thus , they do not provide contribution to the ionization cross sections in the cadw approach .",
    "a few configurations formed by promotion from the @xmath44 shell also straddle the ionization threshold .",
    "however , the one - electron excitations reach only @xmath45 shell in this case .    the ionization process affecting the @xmath46 , @xmath44 , @xmath41 , and @xmath24 shells contribute to the di process .",
    "on the other hand , study of the w@xmath21 ion has demonstrated that ionization from the @xmath46 shell lies above the double - ionization threshold and contributes to the indirect double - ionization process @xcite .",
    "table i shows calculated energy levels for the lowest configurations of the w@xmath1 , w@xmath47 , and w@xmath48 ions .",
    "in addition , the lowest levels of the configurations for the w@xmath47 ion produced from the ground configuration of the w@xmath1 ion after an electron is ionized from the @xmath49 , @xmath46 , @xmath44 , or @xmath41 shells are shown .",
    "one can see that the calculated ionization threshold energy equals to 878.89 ev .",
    "the ionization energy obtained from the scaled electron binding energies is given as @xmath50 ev @xcite .",
    "that is in quite close agreement with our determined value .",
    "the ionization of the long - living level of the [ kr]@xmath51 configuration corresponds to threshold energy 739.56 ev .",
    "this configuration can decay to the ground configuration through the weak electric octupole transitions ( lifetime @xmath52 s ) .",
    "figure  [ ea ] shows contribution of the ea channels originating from the excitations to the high-@xmath22 shells up to @xmath53 .",
    "these data have been produced using the subconfiguration - average distorted - wave ( scadw ) approach .",
    "as it was mentioned eralier , the previous study using the semirelativistic cadw calculations included only the excitations to the outer shells with @xmath4 and @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ ea ] that the additional ea channels originating from the excitations to the higher shells increase cross sections for the indirect part approximately by factor of two .",
    "the convergence for the cross sections is reached when the excitations to the high-@xmath22 shells are included . furthermore , our calculations take into account the excitations to the shells with @xmath54 . fig .",
    "[ ea2nl ] shows that the largest contribution to the ea process comes from the inner shell excitations to the @xmath5 orbital .",
    "the same trend is observed for the @xmath4 and @xmath55 shells .",
    "however , the contribution to the ea process of the excitations to the @xmath5 orbital decreases if compared with other orbitals in the latter case .",
    "it is interesting that none of the excitations from the @xmath46 , @xmath44 , or @xmath41 shells to the @xmath5 orbital give the largest cross sections .",
    "however , the total contribution of the excitations from the @xmath46 , @xmath44 , and @xmath41 shells to the @xmath5 orbital is the largest compared to other orbitals .",
    "it is worth to note that excitations to @xmath56 orbital lead to the strong ea channel for which the relative contribution increases for @xmath55 shells ( fig .",
    "[ ea2nl]b ) . for these shells ,",
    "the largest increase of the relative contribution occurs for the excitations to a @xmath57 orbital compared to the @xmath4 case .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the strongest excitations to the @xmath57 orbital take place from the @xmath41 shell .",
    "however , the configurations @xmath58 with @xmath59 are below the ionization threshold , and they do not contribute to the ea process .",
    "only some levels of the @xmath60 configuration are above the ionization threshold ( fig .",
    "[ energies ] ) . on the other hand , all levels of @xmath61 configuration are above the ionization threshold .",
    "furthermore , the energy levels of the @xmath62 configuration straddle the ionization threshold .",
    "it explains much larger relative contribution to the ea process of the excitations to the @xmath5 orbital for @xmath4 shells .",
    "other interesting result occurs when the ea channel originating from excitations to the @xmath63 orbital starts to dominate at high electron energies for the @xmath55 shells .",
    "contribution of the ea channel to the @xmath5 orbital is slightly smaller at the higher energies when the excitations to the large principal quantum numbers @xmath22 are considered ( fig .",
    "[ ea2nl]b ) .",
    "the ea channel for the excitations from the @xmath41 shell is predicted to produce the largest contribution compared to the ea channels from the @xmath46 and @xmath44 shells because the excitation cross sections are larger for the @xmath41 shell .",
    "however , as it is mentioned above , many configurations produced by the promotion from the @xmath41 shell to the @xmath0 shell for @xmath4 are below the ionization threshold .",
    "therefore , these configurations do not contribute to the ea process .",
    "figure [ ea4l]a demonstrates that the contribution of the excitations from the @xmath41 shell to the ea process for @xmath4 is more than two times smaller compared to the ea channel for the excitations from the @xmath44 shell .",
    "the similar result was obtained for the w@xmath21 ion when the excitations only up to @xmath4 were considered @xcite .",
    "however , the situation drastically changes for the excitations from the @xmath41 to the higher shells because all arising configurations are above the ionization threshold ( fig .",
    "[ ea4l]b ) .",
    "contribution of this ea channel is much larger compared to the ea channel from the @xmath44 shell .",
    "furthermore , the contribution of the ea channel from the @xmath41 shell for the excitations to @xmath55 shells is comparable to the total cross sections of the ea process for the excitations to @xmath4 shells ( fig .",
    "[ ea4l]a ) .",
    "calculations of the ea process for subconfigurations can differ from those for the detailed level - to - level studies . in our scadw calculations ,",
    "the energy levels are grouped into the subconfigurations . for the energy levels that straddle the ionization threshold ,",
    "the corresponding energy of the subconfiguration can be above or below the ionization threshold .",
    "the subconfiguration with the energy above the ionization threshold contributes to the ea process .",
    "therefore , all levels of the subconfiguration , even those located below the ionization threshold , are included when the cross sections are calculated . on the other hand , for the subconfiguration below the ionization threshold ,",
    "the contributions from the corresponding energy levels above the ionization threshold are neglected .",
    "it is interesting to note that the ea cross sections obtained using scadw and lldw approaches are in good agreement when the autoionization branching ratios are not included in calculations ( fig .",
    "[ damping ] ) .",
    "figure  [ damping ] shows that the radiative damping has the large impact on the ionization cross sections .",
    "however , it was found in the previous study that the autoionization branching ratios are close to 1 for this ionization stage @xcite .",
    "the difference can be explained by the fact that the previous study used the configuration - average quantities while the current scadw calculations employ the subconfigurations .",
    "the higher values of the cross sections for the scadw calculations compared to the lldw results suggest that the autoionization branching ratios for the cadw data are closer to 1 .",
    "therefore , the radiative decay paths are restricted for some excited configurations in these two averaged approaches . figure  [ damping ] demonstrates that the level - to - level study is crucial for the ea process in the w@xmath1 ion .",
    "figure  [ total ] presents the total ionization cross sections for the direct and indirect ionization parts where the indirect part accounts for the radiative damping . in this case , the level - to - level calculations are presented .",
    "the contributions of di from the @xmath46 , @xmath44 , @xmath41 , and @xmath24 shells are highlighted .",
    "the largest contribution comes from the ionization of the @xmath41 electron .",
    "as it is shown above , the ea channel for the excitations from the @xmath41 shell has also the largest impact compared to the @xmath46 and @xmath44 contributions ( fig .",

    ", the influence of the @xmath46 shell is very small . to ensure",
    "our data can be easily utilized in modeling studies , we present the total ionization cross sections table [ t2 ] .    it can be seen that the ea process increases the total cross section at the peak nearly by 40 % ( fig .",
    "[ total ] ) .",
    "this contribution would be about two times smaller if the excitations to the higher shells ( @xmath2 ) were not considered .",
    "the ea channels which include only the excitations with @xmath4 and @xmath19 provide for the ea process approximately 10% of the total cross section at the peak .",
    "the ionization cross sections determined for the metastable [ kr]@xmath51 configuration are approximately by 60 % higher for the ea process compared to the ground configuration when the radiative damping is included for these configurations .",
    "the contribution of the indirect process from the high-@xmath0 shells to the total cross sections increases by a factor of two .",
    "the di from the @xmath64 shell is about two times higher for the metastable configuration compared to the ionization from the @xmath24 shell of the ground configuration .",
    "the contribution of the excitations to high-@xmath0 shells has been studied for the electron - impact excitation - autoionization process .",
    "calculations for the w@xmath1 ion illustrate that the excitations to the high-@xmath0 shells ( @xmath65 ) increase the cross section values by a factor of two for the indirect part of the ionization process . the largest contribution to",
    "the indirect part comes from the excitations to @xmath5 orbital .",
    "surprisingly , large contribution also arises from the excitations to @xmath56 orbital .",
    "the ea cross sections for excitations from the @xmath41 shell to the shells with @xmath4 is approximately two times smaller compared to the excitations from the @xmath44 shell . on the other hand , situation drastically changes for the excitations to the higher shells with @xmath65 where the excitations from the @xmath41 shell dominate . in this case , the ea cross sections for the excitations from the @xmath41 shell are nearly three times higher .",
    "the current calculations for the w@xmath1 ion show that the radiative damping has crucial effect on the cross sections of the indirect process .",
    "the cross section values decrease by two times for the lldw results .",
    "however , the influence of the radiative damping to the subconfiguration - average cross sections is approximately 30 % smaller compared to the influence in the level - to - level calculations .",

    "good agreement with experiment for the low - charge states does not ensure that the same list of the investigated shells for the ea process is enough when the higher - charge states are considered . in order to estimate the contribution from the high-@xmath0 shells ,",
