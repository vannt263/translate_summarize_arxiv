    "_ complex dynamical systems and network mesoscopic structure .",
    "_ in recent years a lot of attention has been devoted to the problem of representing the complex dynamical systems by networks and investigating their structural and dynamical properties @xcite .",
    "these networks often exhibit inhomogeneity at all scales , from the local level ( individual nodes ) , to mesoscopic ( groups of nodes ) and global network level .",
    "the mesoscopic inhomogeneity of networks may be defined as topologically distinct groupings of nodes in a range from few nodes to large modules , communities , or different interconnected sub - networks .",
    "these subgraphs play an important role in the network s complexity along the line from the local interactions to emergent global behavior , both in the structure and the function of networks @xcite .",
    "hence , the characteristic subgraphs can be defined not only topologically but also dynamically , and different subgraphs appear to characterize different functional networks . in particular , _ communities _ are often studied in social networks @xcite , topological _ modules _",
    "@xcite and characteristic dynamical _ motifs _",
    "@xcite are found in genetic interactions and communication networks , whereas _ paths _ and _ trees _ appear as relevant subgraphs in the networks representing biochemical metabolic processes and neural networks @xcite .",
    "_ chains _ , representing a special type of _ motifs _ , have been observed in networks of words in books and the power grid networks , @xcite . in these examples",
    "the mesoscopic topology is related to dynamics of the whole network . on the other side",
    ", we have _ multi - networks _ consisting of a few interconnected networks in which the internal structure and possibly also dynamics might be different @xcite .",
    "then the interaction between such diverse networks leads to emergent global behavior , as for instance in the networks representing interacting eco - systems @xcite .",
    "understanding the mesoscopic structure of networks in both topological and dynamical sense is , therefore , of paramount importance in the quantitative study of complex dynamical systems .",
    "recently much attention was devoted to network s topological modularity , such as community structure @xcite , where a wide range of methods are designed to find the appropriate network partitioning .",
    "mostly these methods use the centrality measures ( i.e. , a topological @xcite or a dynamical @xcite flow ) based on the maximal - flow - minimal - cut theorem @xcite .",
    "further effective approaches for graph partitioning utilize the statistical methods of maximum - likelihood @xcite , occurrence of different time scales in the dynamic synchronization @xcite and eigenvector localization @xcite in mesoscopically inhomogeneous structures . in more formal approaches , the definitions of different mesoscopic structures in terms of _ simplexes _ and their combinations , _ simplicial complexes _",
    ", are well known in the graph theory @xcite .",
    "this approach has been recently applied @xcite to scale - free ( sf ) graphs and some other real - world networks .",
    "_ spectral analysis of networks .",
    "_ properties of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix of a complex network and of other , e.g. , laplacian matrices related to the network structure , contain important information that interpolates between the network structure and dynamic processes on it .",
    "one of the well studied examples is the synchronization of phase - coupled oscillators on networks @xcite , where the smallest eigenvalue of the laplacian matrix corresponds to the fully synchronized state .",
    "the synchronization between nodes belonging to better connected subgraphs ( modules ) occurs at somewhat smaller time scale @xcite corresponding to lowest nonzero eigenvalues of the laplacian , and the positive / negative components of the corresponding eigenvectors are localized on these modules @xcite .",
    "the spreading of diseases @xcite and random walks and navigated random walks @xcite are other type of the diffusive processes on networks which are related to the laplacian spectra .    compared to the well known semicircular law for the random matrices @xcite , the spectra of binary and structured graphs have additional prominent features , which can be related to the graph structure @xcite .",
    "particularly , some of the striking differences found in the scale - free graphs are the appearance of the central peak or a triangular form @xcite and the power - law tail @xcite in the spectral density of the adjacency matrix , which is related to the node connectivity . in the classical paper samukhin _",
    "@xcite elucidated the role of the minimally - connected nodes on the laplacian spectra of trees and uncorrelated tree - like graphs .",
    "they derived analytical expression for the spectral density of the laplacian matrix .",
    "other topological features of the graph , particularly the finite clustering @xcite and the presence of modules @xcite , have been also found to affect the laplacian spectra .",
    "attempts to classify the graphs according to their spectral features were presented recently @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study systematically the spectral properties of a large class of sparse networks with mesoscopic inhomogeneities .",
    "the topology of these networks at all scales may lead to qualitative differences in the spectra both of the adjacency and laplacian matrix .",
    "having well controlled structure of the networks by the model parameters , we are able to quantitatively relate the spectral properties of the networks to their structure . as explained below , we identify different regions of the spectra in which certain structural features are mainly manifested .",
    "we further explore these networks by simulating the random walk dynamics on them .",
    "we focus only on two properties of random walks : hitting patterns and first - return time distribution , which are closely related to graph structure and spectrum of the laplacian . in this way we would like to emphasise deeper interconnections between the structure and the dynamics of complex networks and their spectra ,",
    "features which often remain fragmented in numerous studies of complex networks .    in section",
    "[ sec : model ] we represent model of growing networks with controlled number of modules and their internal structure .",
    "we then briefly study the spectral density of the adjacency matrix of modular networks in section  [ sec : adjasency ] .",
    "section  [ sec : laplace ] is devoted to detailed analysis of the spectra of the normalized laplacian matrix , which is related to the diffusive dynamics on these networks .",
    "the simulations of random walks on trees and on sparse modular graphs with minimal connectivity @xmath3 is presented in section  [ sec : rw ] .",
    "finally , a short summary and the discussion of the results is given in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we first present the model for growing networks with statistically defined modularity .",
    "it is based on the model for growing clustered scale - free graphs originally introduced in ref .",
    "the preferential - attachment and preferential - rewiring during the graph growth leads to the correlated scale - free structure , which is statistically similar to the one in real www @xcite .",
    "two parameters , @xmath4 and @xmath5 as explained below , fully control the emergent structure . here",
    "we generalize the model in a nontrivial manner by allowing that a new _ module _ starts growing with probability @xmath6 .",
    "the added nodes are attached preferentially _ within the currently growing module _ , whereas the complementary rewiring process is done between all existing nodes in the network .",
    "the growth rules are explained in detail below .    at each time step @xmath7",
    "we add a new node @xmath8 and @xmath5 new links . with probability @xmath9 a new group ( module )",
    "is started and the current group index is assigned to the added node ( first node belong to the first group ) .",
    "the group index plays a crucial role in linking of the node to the rest of the network .",
    "note that each link is , in principle , directed , i.e. , emanating from the _ origin node _ and pointing to the _ target node_. for each link the target node , @xmath10 , is always searched within the currently growing module ( identified by its group index @xmath11 ) .",
    "the target is selected preferentially according to its current number of _ incoming _ links @xmath12 .",
    "the probability @xmath13 is normalized according to all possible choices at time @xmath7 @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 stand for , respectively , the number of nodes and links within the growing module @xmath11 .",
    "the link @xmath17 is fixed with the probability @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath18 , there is a finite probability @xmath19 that the link from the new added node @xmath17 is cut ( rewired ) and a new origin node @xmath20 is searched from which the link @xmath21 established and fixed . the new origin node @xmath20 is searched within all nodes in the network present at the moment @xmath7 .",
    "the search is again preferential but according to the current number of outgoing links @xmath22@xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are total number of nodes and links in the entire network at the moment @xmath7 .",
    "note that the number of added links is smaller than @xmath5 for the first few nodes in the modul until @xmath26 nodes are in the module .",
    "we are interested in sparse networks , for instance @xmath27 , the second added node in a new module can have only one link pointing to the first node in that module .",
    "the second link is attempted once within the rewiring procedure the probability @xmath19 , otherwise it is not added .",
    "it is also assumed that nodes have no in - coming or out - going links when they are added to the network , i.e. , @xmath28=@xmath29 .",
    "some examples of the emergent modular graphs of size @xmath30 nodes are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - graphs4 ] .",
    "the networks which we consider throughout this paper are :    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we simulate the random walks on the networks studied above , net269 and net161 , and similar structures , which contain @xmath31 nodes and random walks on each network perform up to @xmath32 steps . for improved statistics ,",
    "the total number of walker steps consists of 2000 pieces as follows : first a random walk is started from a node @xmath8 and when it first arrives to an in advance randomly selected node @xmath33 , then a new target node @xmath10 is randomly selected , etc . in the simulations we measure the elapsed time @xmath34 between two successive visits of the walker to the same node ( first return to the origin ) .",
    "the times @xmath34 are measured at each node of the network and the distribution @xmath35 _ averaged over all @xmath36 nodes ( origins ) _ and over the ensemble of 2000 walks .",
    "the probability density functions of the return times , @xmath35 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - rw1 ] ( a ) and ( b ) for different trees and cyclic networks .",
    "in addition , we sampled the time series of the number of hits of the random walker @xmath37 within a fixed time window of @xmath38 steps , for each node in the network @xmath39 . in fig .",
    "[ fig - rw1]a the results for the first return - times distribution of the walker to a node is shown for the case of of the random walks on scale - free tree , the tree of trees and for the tree with cliques .",
    "the numerical results show no significant difference for all kinds of trees ( all data are log - binned with a very small base @xmath40 ) .",
    "moreover , for @xmath41 the data are well fitted with the expression @xmath42 } \\",
    "\\label{eq - prett}\\ ] ] ( shown by full line in fig .  [ fig - rw1]a ) , with the exponents @xmath43 and @xmath44 within a numerical error .",
    "the presence of small cliques attached to the tree ( network shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - graphs4]d ) does not affect the tail of the distribution @xmath35 suggesting that long return times are mainly determined by the tree structure of the underlying graph .",
    "note also that there are no significant difference between the random walks on the random tree and the scale - free tree , as well as the tree of trees ( network in fig .",
    "[ fig - graphs4]c ) . in one of the early works considering the diffusion on random graphs @xcite the exponent 1/3 for the case of random walk on a tree",
    "was derived by heuristic arguments .",
    "a similar expression fits the distribution in the case of random walks on cyclic graphs , however , with different exponents .",
    "the fit suggests the stretching exponent @xmath45 , that is twice larger compared with the case of trees .",
    "the simulations of random walks on various cyclic networks , also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - rw1]b , suggest that , within the numerical accuracy , the tail of the distribution @xmath35 is practically independent on the size of cycles including triangles . a short region with very small slope is found in the intermediate part of the curve , in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ eq - prett ] ) with very small @xmath46 .",
    "for short return times @xmath47 we find tendency to a power - law dependence as @xmath48 , which is more pronounced in networks with increased clustering and modularity . for the tree with attached modules , described in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - graphs4]d , the tail of return - time distribution @xmath35 on this network are also shown in fig .  [ fig - rw1]b : the tail tends to oscillate between the curves for the trees ( long - dashed line ) and the cyclic graphs , with a pronounced crossover at short times .",
    "analysis of the time series @xmath37 of the number of hits of the random walker to each node reveals additional regularity in the dynamics , which underly the return - time distribution . in fig .",
    "[ fig - rw1]c we show the scatter plot of the dispersion @xmath49 of the time series @xmath50 against the average @xmath51 for each node @xmath39 represented by a point . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - rw1]c , long - range correlations in the diffusion processes on networks lead to a non - universal scaling relation @xcite @xmath52 where the averaging over all time windows is taken .",
    "the exponent @xmath53 depends on the network structure and the size of the time window .",
    "the origin of scaling in diffusive processes on networks has been discussed in detail in @xcite and references therein . here",
    "we stress the differences of the underlying networks for the fixed time window @xmath38 : we find @xmath54 and @xmath55 for tree of trees and modular network net269 , respectively . in this plots the groups of nodes that are most often visited can be identified at the top - right region of the plot .",
    "ranking distribution of the average number of hits @xmath51 at nodes is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - rw1]d for the same two representative networks .",
    "generally , the number of hits of true random walker to a node is proportional to node connectivity @xcite and thus , the ranking distribution is a power - law with the slope @xmath56 which is directly related to the ranking distribution of degree in fig .",
    "[ degree - ranking ] . in the presence of network modularity",
    "we realize the flat part of the curve , representing most visited nodes . in our modular network , like net269 , these nodes are roots of different modules",
    ". a similar feature can be seen in the case of tree of trees ( top curve in fig .",
    "[ fig - rw1]d ) . however , closer inspection of the number of hits in time , shown in 3-dimensional plot in fig .",
    "[ fig-3d ] , suggests that the most visited nodes on the trees are not necessarily related to the roots of the subtrees .",
    "whereas , in the cyclic modular net269 the root nodes of each module can be clearly identified as most visited nodes and are identical to the most connected nodes in each module .",
    "we have presented a model of growing modular networks in which we tune the structural properties at all scales by varying the respective control parameters .",
    "specifically , the parameter @xmath6 controls the number of topologically distinct subgraphs ( modules ) ; the parameter @xmath4 is directly related to the number of rewired links which , in turn , determine the clustering inside the scale - free subgraphs and connections between different modules ; the parameter @xmath5 is the average number of links per node , which can be varied independently on the clustering and modularity .",
    "the wide class of mesoscopically inhomogeneous networks grown by varying these parameters includes the _ sparse modular graphs _ with variety of topological features , both within the modules and at the level of the connecting network .",
    "two limiting cases are the interacting scale - free networks with finite clustering and correlations , at one end , and a scale - free tree supporting a large number of cyclic modules , on the other ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - graphs4 ] ) .",
    "we further study the spectral properties of these networks by focusing on the normalized laplacian matrix which is related to the diffusion ( random walk ) processes on these networks .",
    "we have also explored these networks by simulating random walks on them .",
    "the systematic analysis of the spectra while the network grows and by varying the control parameters enabled us to point out the role played by a specific topological property of the network ( controlled by different parameter ) in their spectra and the dynamics .",
    "two prototype modular networks ",
    "tree connecting scale - free tree subgraphs ( net161 ) and the cyclic graph connecting scale - free clustered subgraphs ( net269 ) , exhibit systematic differences at the level of spectra and the random - walk dynamics .",
    "our complete spectral analysis reveals the firm connection between the structure and spectra .",
    "we have found several new results and also demonstrated clearly how some expected results for this type of graphs are related to the structure .",
    "specifically , we point out :    * the role of most connected nodes as opposed to the role of the underlying tree graph ; * the role that least connected nodes play in the appearance of the central peak ; * how the increased clustering changes the shape of the spectrum near the central peak ; * the appearance of the extra peak at small eigenvalues of the normalized laplacian ; in view of our fine tunning of the structure , this peak is related to the number of distinct modules even if the graphs are very sparse , as long as they are cyclic ; increased clustering does not affect this peak ; * the laplacian spectra of trees are different , particularly , they do not show extra peak related with the ( tree ) subgraphs ; * the eigenvector components show the expected pattern of localization on modules in the case of small nonzero eigenvalues of the laplacian . in spite of the differences in the spectral density",
    ", we find a similar localization pattern in trees with tree subgraphs .",
    "in addition , we find a robust localization along the network chains of the eigenvectors for largest eigenvalue of the laplacian @xmath57 , occurring only in trees and bipartite graphs ; * the simulation results for the first return - time distribution of the random walks , averaged over network nodes , on different tree graphs exhibits a power - law with stretching exponential cut - off with @xmath1 in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ eq - prett ] ) and heuristic arguments @xcite ; * when the graph contains cycles , the distribution belongs to another class of behavior with twice larger stretching exponent .",
    "the numerical results do not dependent on the clustering coefficient .",
    "the presence of modules and increased clustering affect the behavior at small times , where a power - law decay occurs before the cutoff .    our systematic numerical study along the line structure  spectra  random - walks quantifies the relationships between different structural elements of the network and their spectra and the dynamics .",
    "we hope that the presented results contribute to better understanding of the diffusion processes on the sparse graphs with complex topology .",
    "potentially , some of our findings may be used for fine differentiation between classes of graphs with respect their spectral and dynamical properties .",
