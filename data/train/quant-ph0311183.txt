    "in recent years , much progress has been made in cooling and trapping techniques for neutral atoms and for ions  @xcite .",
    "in fact , in a trapped ion the center - of - mass dynamics gets entangled with the internal degrees of freedom and some peculiar aspects of the vibrational response have been successfully exploited for experimentally generating fock  @xcite , coherent and squeezed  @xcite , and schrdinger catlike states  @xcite , proposing theoretical schemes for engineering several nonclassical states  @xcite , realizing tomographic reconstructions of the density matrix  @xcite , and characterizing a variety of quantum effects  @xcite .",
    "this is of fundamental interest , since it brings to the forefront issues involving the relationship between quantum and classical physics , but also offers potential applications for , e.g. , precision spectroscopy  @xcite or quantum computation  @xcite .    in modeling typical experiments",
    "one considers a three - level atomic system interacting with two laser fields ( raman scheme  @xcite ) and reduces it to a two - level problem on the assumption of large detunings by using the adiabatic elimination  @xcite : the effective hamiltonian obtained in this way has the form of the usual jaynes - cummings model .",
    "adiabatic elimination has been criticized on several grounds  @xcite , and other methods of deriving effective hamiltonians exist  @xcite . in this spirit , we have recently proposed an alternative approach that involves using a unitary transformation ( in fact , a nonlinear rotation ) to obtain an equivalent hamiltonian for which one level decouples  @xcite . the transformation can be exactly found and gives the same results as the adiabatic elimination ( except for including intensity - dependent stark shifts ) when it is evaluated up to second - order terms in coupling constants .    to take into account the effects of damping in raman cooling schemes ,",
    "the standard way of proceeding is to start from the master equation for the three - level system and adiabatically eliminate the far - off resonant level .",
    "the details are described in many different text books  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it is known that this treatment is not valid in many regimes of physical interest and other approximations are required  @xcite .    the main purpose of this paper is to show how our approach of nonlinear rotations allows one to go around these drawbacks in a natural way .",
    "our strategy can be stated in very simple terms : starting from the exact master equation for the three - level model , we apply to it the same unitary transformation leading to the effective hamiltonian , obtaining in this way what we call an effective master equation  @xcite . here",
    "we fully investigate this approach and present numerical evidences of its validity .",
    "in the interest of retaining as much clarity as possible , we first recall some well - known facts  @xcite about the system we wish to treat here , which consists of a three - level trapped ion in the @xmath0 configuration with energy levels @xmath1 , as shown in figure 1 . as usual , to describe this system we use the operators @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the eigenstate of the @xmath4th atomic level",

    "the ion is trapped in a harmonic potential .",
    "therefore , the center - of - mass motion can be described in terms of annihilation and creation operators of vibrational quanta ( phonons ) in the usual way @xmath19 where @xmath20 represents the oscillatory frequency along the @xmath21th direction , @xmath22 is the ion mass , and @xmath23 is the width of the ground - state wave function .    the hamiltonian that describes the system is @xmath24 , where @xmath25 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\hbar [ g_b(\\hat{\\mathbf{x } } ) \\",
