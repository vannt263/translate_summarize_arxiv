    "x - ray reflection spectroscopy is currently our most effective tool for probing accretion processes and space - time near the supermassive black holes that power active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . in the current paradigm ,",
    "the power - law continuum is produced either in a central hot corona ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or at the base of a jet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a fraction of this radiation illuminates the accretion disk and is reprocessed into a rich reflection spectrum consisting of fluorescent lines and other features , which provides detailed information on the composition and ionization state of the accretion disk and constraints on the structure of the corona .",
    "importantly , reflection spectroscopy of agn is _ the _ way to infer the spin of their black holes via modeling key spectral features , such as the fe k line ( @xmath2@xmath3  kev ) , the fe k edge ( @xmath4@xmath5  kev ) , and the compton hump ( @xmath6@xmath7  kev ) .",
    "observational data suggest that in many cases the illuminating power - law continuum cuts off abruptly in the hard x - ray band ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "most x - ray detectors are unable to accurately constrain this cutoff energy because they either have limited sensitivity at high - energies or none at all .",
    "thus , reflection models have been traditionally simplified by adopting a fixed cutoff energy at a reasonable value , e.g. , @xmath8  kev @xcite .",
    "the 2012 launch of  @xcite has revolutionized reflection spectroscopy because its instruments provide both very low background and superb sensitivity over the band 379  kev , which captures all the key reflection features ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the quality of the  data demand reflection models that properly treat the high - energy cutoff as a fit parameter . we have developed advanced relativistic models of x - ray reflection from ionized accretion disks ;",
    "the most recent version is  @xcite .",
    "these models include a rich atomic database , full treatment of the angular distribution of the reflected radiation , and an improved geometrical model of the illuminating coronal source .",
    "furthermore , the most recent version of  also includes the high - energy cutoff  as a fit parameter .",
    "likewise ,  is included as a free parameter in the most recent version of the reflection code reflionx @xcite .    in the standard picture ,",
    "the power law spectrum is generated in the corona by compton up - scattering of thermal disk photons .",
    "the shape of the spectrum depends on the geometry , temperature , and optical depth of the corona ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , the fractional energy change of a scattered photon ( in the non - relativistic limit ) @xmath9 implies a cutoff of the power - law near @xmath10 because the energy gained by the photon can not exceed the energy of the electron ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . in practice ,",
    "@xmath11 due to dispersion , geometrical , and relativistic effects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , an empirical estimate of  provides direct information on the temperature @xmath12 of the coronal electrons .",

    "in most of these studies , the coverage of  to 79  kev was sufficient to directly observe the roll over of the power - law component ( @xmath13  kev ) .",
    "however , fitting a  spectrum of ngc  5506 with relativistic reflection models , @xcite surprisingly found = @xmath14  kev .",
    "likewise , in fitting a +  spectrum of ngc  4151 @xcite found that a value of  near 1  mev was statistically required .    in this letter",
    ", we demonstrate the remarkable ability of reflection models to provide strong constraints on  up to several hundred kev , values that greatly exceed the limit of the detector bandpass ( e.g. , 79  kev for ) . while not detected directly , this high - energy portion of the spectrum conditions the ionization state and structure of the disk atmosphere , which in turn modifies the observed reflection features .",
    "thus , by properly modeling the reflection component at moderate energies , one can accurately estimate  at extreme energies and thereby constrain the physical properties of the corona .",
    "the reflection model  is a fusion of our reflection code  @xcite and @xcite , which is a general - relativistic ray tracing code .",
    "we first describe the atomic physics part , which assumes plane - parallel geometry and idealizes the disk as a slab with a total optical depth of @xmath15 and a constant density of @xmath16  @xmath17 .",
    "the illuminating source is assumed to have a power - law spectrum with a photon index @xmath0 and an exponential cutoff at high energies , .",
    "the intensity of the illumination is controlled by specifying the ionization parameter : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the net ionizing flux in the energy band 11000  ry .",
    "a comprehensive grid of models has been calculated and provided to the community for fitting observational data that cover a wide range of model parameters .",
    "the most recent version of  includes models for several different values of the high - energy cutoff , namely , @xmath20  kev . in figure",
    "[ fig : xillver ] we show examples of models for these values of  for two ionization parameters , log  @xmath21 and log  @xmath22 .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig : xillver ] and discussed in @xcite , @xmath23 controls the intensity and shape of the illuminating spectrum and thereby affects the global reflection spectrum .",
    "the compton hump is most dramatically affected , its peak shifting to lower energies as  decreases .",
    "weaker effects are seen at lower energies ( @xmath24  kev ) , which are mostly driven by changes in the ionization state of the gas .",
    "as equation  [ eq : xi ] suggests , two models with the same ionization parameter ( and hence the same @xmath25 ) but different values of  will give rise to distinctive reflection spectra .",
    "this difference occurs because the illuminating spectrum with lower  will have a significantly larger proportion of its photons concentrated at lower energies , which favors photoelectric interactions over electron scattering relative to the spectrum with high .",
    "changes in  and the consequent shift in the balance of photons in the hard and soft bands affects the ionization structure of the slab , as illustrated in the two right panels of figure  [ fig : xillver ] . on the one hand , for low ionization the lower values of  ( strong soft flux ) produce hotter atmospheres ; as a consequence , in this regime the temperature is mainly regulated by photoionization heating and recombination cooling . on the other hand , for high ionization",
    "the hotter atmospheres correspond to higher values of  ( strong hard flux ) ; in this regime , the temperature is controlled by electron scattering of the abundant hard photons .",
    "finally , we stress that despite the opposing trends in the temperature profiles shown in figure  [ fig : xillver ] , for a fixed value of @xmath26 the reflected spectrum is always softer for smaller .    to produce the complete relativistic model , we convolve spectra computed along the disk using  with the general - relativistic ray tracing code  @xcite . the model self - consistently calculates the angle - dependent , relativistic ionized reflection spectra @xcite that are used in fitting data .",
    "figure  [ fig : relxill ] shows reflected spectra ( and the incident power - law spectra ) for log  @xmath21 calculated with . for clarity , we show only two models , for = 300  kev and = 1  mev .",
    "these are the same as the corresponding two models shown in the top - left panel of figure  [ fig : xillver ] , except that here the spectral features are blurred by doppler and gravitational - redshift effects .",
    "the lower panel in figure  [ fig : relxill ] shows the ratio of the = 300  kev model to the = 1  mev model and also the ratio of the incident power - law spectra . in the  band , while the two models can be distinguished by considering either the power - law or the reflected component , it is the stronger curvature of the reflected component that is more telling . at lower energies , in the  band , the power - law is incapable of distinguishing between the two models because the continuum is essentially identical ( apart from the normalization ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the reflected component shows significant changes in spectral features , which sharply distinguish the models .",
    "thus , whether one considers  alone , or  plus , it is possible to constrain  at energies far above the bandpass of the detector , but in either case it is the reflected component that carries the greater weight .     and the respective power - law spectra ( dashed lines ) of the illuminating source with slope @xmath27 .",
    "the red curves are for = 300  kev and the blue curves for = 1  mev . _",
    "bottom : _ ratio of the = 300  kev spectra to the = 1  mev spectra .",
    "the ratio of the reflection / power - law spectra is plotted as a solid / dashed line .",
    "the shaded box spans the bandpass ( 379  kev ) . ]",
    "we first demonstrate that  data alone can provide strong constraints on . to this end , we simulate data using appropriate response and background files , assuming a circular extraction region with 60@xmath28 radius centered 1@xmath29 off axis . we combine the data from both  telescopes ( focal plane modules fpma and fpmb ) and simulate spectra for an exposure time of 100  ks .",
    "we consider sources , both extragalactic and galactic , with intensities / fluxes that cover the range normally encountered in practice .",
    "using the isis package @xcite , we grouped the data so that the minimum signal - to - noise ratio for each bin was 5 to ensure the soundness of our @xmath30 analysis .",
    "we additionally grouped the data to ensure appropriate sampling , given that the resolution of the  detectors is 0.4/0.9  kev at 6/60  kev .",
    "specifically , we further binned the simulated data , which have uniform bin widths of 0.04  kev over the entire energy band , to 0.2  kev and 0.4  kev for energies below and above 20  kev , respectively .    in the simulations",
    ", we used the model tbabs*relxill ( section  [ sec : models ] ) , where tbabs models the interstellar absorption @xcite .",
    "we simulated spectra for eleven values of the high - energy cutoff ranging from 50  kev to 1  mev .",
    "the other model parameters , which are the same for all simulations , are : the hydrogen column density @xmath31  @xmath32 ; dimensionless spin parameter @xmath33 ; emissivity index @xmath34 ; inclination of the disk @xmath35  deg ; inner disk radius @xmath36 ; power - law @xmath27 ; ionization parameter @xmath37 ; iron abundance @xmath38 ; and the reflection fraction @xmath39 , which is defined as the ratio of the reflected to the power - law flux in the 2040  kev band .",
    "our calculations in this instance do not link the reflection fraction to the emissivity index , which would require specifying the geometry of the reflector and the illuminating source .",
    "we emphasize that this letter deals exclusively with relativistically - blurred reflection by ionized gas in the very inner portion of the accretion disk for which the reflection fraction can vary widely , with values ranging from a few tenths to @xmath40 for rapidly spinning black holes @xcite .",
    "reflection in this regime is not to be confused with reflection by distant , neutral material , which is observed in the spectra of many sources and is usually modeled using the pexrav model ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "we generated the simulated spectra using the fakeit task in xspec v-12.8.2b @xcite , and we then fitted these spectra using two different models , with , @xmath0 , @xmath26 , @xmath41 , normalization , and @xmath42 free to vary :    * model  1 : tbabs*relxill*. we first employ the same model used to produce the simulated data in order to evaluate how well the parameters ,  in particular , can be recovered .",
    "* model  2 : tbabs*highecut*relxill*. in this case , the parameter  in  is fixed at 1  mev , while it is allowed to vary freely in highecut , a simple exponential convolution model acting on . model  2 aims to test how accurately  is recovered when the spectrum is described by modifying the high - energy region of an otherwise incorrect reflection model ( i.e. , when ignoring the effects on the disk s ionization structure described in ",
    "[ sec : models ] ) .",
    "results of fitting the simulated data are shown in figure  [ fig : fits ] .",
    "the top panels show the fitted values of versus the values used in simulating the data , with results for model  1/2 in the left / right panel .",
    "the shaded regions indicate uncertainties at the 90% confidence level .",
    "the colors are keyed to source intensity .",
    "the quality of the fits is indicated in the lower panels .",
    "focusing on the results for model  1 ( top - left panel ) and the 10  mcrab source , which delivers @xmath43  counts in the  band , the recovered values of  below 400 kev are of marginal quality , while above that energy they only provide lower limits on .",
    "however , for source intensities of @xmath44  mcrab ( @xmath45  counts ) , significantly better performance is achieved .",
    "we conclude that for high - quality data one can determine the high - energy cutoff with reasonable precision using  data alone .",
    "turning to the results for model  2 ( top - right panel ) , one immediately sees the much poorer performance achieved in attempting to recover by simply fitting the curvature in the power - law continuum component using the highecut model .",
    "as mentioned in section  [ sec : intro ] , this was the standard approach used before was included as a fit parameter in reflection models .",
    "the highecut model provides constraints of reasonable quality only for @xmath46  kev .",
    "furthermore , for the brightest source considered ( 500  mcrab ) , model  2 yields unsatisfactory results for @xmath47  kev because not only is  significantly over - predicted , the error bars are also misleadingly small .",
    "interestingly , at lower energies the quality of the fits are worse for the brightest source ( figure  [ fig : fits ] , bottom - right panel ) .",
    "other model parameters are also poorly constrained , e.g. , the fe abundance is grossly underestimated , while both the power - law index and the reflection fraction @xmath42 are over - predicted .",
    "importantly , we note that models 1 and 2 give the same quality of fit ( with the exception of the 500 mcrab simulation for low ) so that a @xmath30-test does not generally promote one model over the other . however , as we have demonstrated , model  2 returns incorrect estimates of the parameters in all cases . in short ,",
    "_ good statistical precision does not ensure that the parameter values returned by a fit to a model are reliable or physically meaningful . _",
    "figure  [ fig : relxill ] indicates that the low - energy component ( @xmath48  kev ) of the reflection spectrum is more sensitive to the value of  than the component in the  band .",
    "therefore , we now consider spectra comprised of  plus  data in the expectation that this will significantly improve the constraints on , and the other parameters as well .",
    "the simulated low - energy data are prepared using  response files , the same set of model parameters , and the same source fluxes as those used in preparing the  data .    in the following ,",
    "we consider only model  1 .",
    "fitting the combined set of  ( 0.58  kev ) and  ( 379  kev ) simulated spectra , we obtain the outstanding result shown in figure  [ fig : suzaku ] .",
    "the fit for the 10 mcrab source is incomparably better than for the  data alone ( compare upper - left panel of figure  [ fig : fits ] ) .",
    "the high - energy cutoff is strongly constrained for all values of  considered ; even at 1  mev , the error is only about 7% .",
    "this excellent performance of our reflection model is a consequence of the sensitivity of the reflection component to changes in the high - energy portion of the illuminating spectrum ( figure  [ fig : relxill ] ) .",
    "these simulations clearly demonstrate that fits to features in the relatively low - energy portion of the spectrum , where the instruments are most sensitive , can deliver accurate measurements of  at energies far beyond the limit of the detector bandpass .    also shown in figure  [ fig : suzaku ]",
    "are the results for a 1  mcrab source ( @xmath49  counts ) .",
    "remarkably , with the inclusion of low - energy data even @xmath50  counts are sufficient to recover with reasonable precision ; the error bars for @xmath51  kev are @xmath52% .    finally , with two additional simulations we demonstrate that the reflection component is much more important in constraining  than the power law . for the same 1 mcrab source , and including  data , figure  [ fig : plcomp ] compares the performance of a cutoff power - law model alone ( cutoffpl ) with a pure reflection model .",
    "these two limiting cases can be compared directly to the intermediate case of our adopted composite model ( i.e. , power law plus reflection ) with @xmath39 shown in gray in figure  [ fig : suzaku ] .",
    "the three cases considered together show that stronger reflection translates into a better constraint on .",
    "we have demonstrated that our reflection model  can constrain the physically important coronal parameter  for spectra with intensities like those encountered in observations of agn .",
    "we have furthermore shown that attempting to constrain  by imposing a cutoff that is external to the reflection model yields relatively poor constraints on .",
    "such a simplified model inaccurately represents the observed spectrum and introduces strong biases in the values inferred for the key physical parameters .",
    "we analyzed two simulated data sets using : ( 1 ) with data alone ( 379 kev ) , @xmath53  kev can only be constrained if the spectrum contains @xmath54  counts , which is infeasible for most observations of agn .",
    "( 2 ) however , our simulations indicate that for a simultaneous fit to  and data ( 0.579 kev ) , one can constrain  for a 1  mcrab source at energies far above the limit of the detector bandpass .      1 .",
    "in constraining the cutoff energy , misleading results are obtained if the power - law component is cut off externally .",
    "it is therefore essential to employ a detailed and accurate model of the reflection spectrum that includes  as an internal fit parameter .",
    "because the cutoff energy most strongly affects the low - energy part of the reflection spectrum , to obtain useful constraints on for agn it is crucial to combine  data with low - energy ( e.g. ,  or ) data .",
    "this limited study provides only a very cursory exploration of how proper modeling of a reflection spectrum yields useful physical constraints on the high - energy cutoff out to extreme energies .",
    "a thorough exploration of the subject is well beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "for example , we illustrate the effects on the reflected spectrum of varying  for the cases of log@xmath21 and 3 ( figure  [ fig : xillver ] ) while only presenting simulations for the former case .",
    "however , one expects that the effects will be quite different for other choices of the ionization parameter .",
