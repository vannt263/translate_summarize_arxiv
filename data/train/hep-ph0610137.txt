    "the measurements of the ccfr collaboration provide a precise determination of the non - singlet deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) structure functions of neutrinos and anti - neutrinos on nucleons , @xmath8 @xcite .",

    "the @xmath11-dependence of moments of structure functions can be predicted in perturbative qcd , and fits to the data can be used to infer @xmath12 ( or equivalently @xmath6 ) . in doing this , the principal difficulty is that there are upper and lower limits on the experimentally accessible range of @xmath4 at low and high @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the moments are potentially sensitive to this missing information , and this propagates into an additional level of uncertainty in the resultant prediction of @xmath12 .",

    "@xcite and @xcite used the then state - of - the - art three - loop ( nnlo ) results for the anomalous dimension and coefficient function , which were restricted to a subset of odd moments @xmath18 @xcite .",

    "@xcite were linear combinations of _ odd _ moments , but the new results of refs .",
    "@xcite mean that , by a slight redefinition of the polynomials , even moments can now also be studied .",
    "in this paper we intend to perform such an extended analysis .",
    "we shall fit the ccfr data @xcite to ps and corgi nnlo qcd predictions , and will in addition compare with the predictions in the closely - related method of effective charges approach ( ec ) @xcite .",

    "we shall also compare our results to those obtained using a fitting technique based on jacobi polynomials @xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is to give a brief review of the factorization and renormalization scheme dependence of structure function moments in section 2 . in section 3",

    "we shall show how to modify the definition of the polynomials to accommodate both odd and even moments .",
    "we then constrain the set of acceptable bernstein moments to be used in the fits by comparing how four different methods of extrapolation ( to obtain @xmath21 on the full @xmath4-range ) differ ; this enables us to define a ` modelling error ' to be combined with the other sources of error in our analysis . in section 5",
    "we give details of the fitting procedure and in section 6 we present the results of the fits to the ps , corgi and ec predictions for the moments , and consider how the fits change if target mass corrections and higher twist corrections are included .",

    "@xmath26 is the rg - improved coupling .",
    "the operator matrix element is factorized at the scale @xmath17 into a non - perturbative component and a perturbative expression , written in terms of the coupling evaluated at the factorization scale , @xmath27 .",
    "the factorization scale dependence is governed by the anomalous dimension equation , @xmath28 here @xmath29 is the anomalous dimension of the moment .",
    "it has the following perturbative expansion , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is factorization scheme invariant , and the higher coefficients serve to label the factorization scheme dependence .",

    "the higher coefficients serve to label the rs dependence . together , these two equations determine the perturbative behaviour of the operator matrix element .",
    "for the remainder of this paper we simplify our notation by dropping the sub- and superscripts ` @xmath35 ' , ` @xmath19 ' , ` @xmath36 ' and ` ns ' , from the quantities in eqs .  ( [ eq : momfac ] ) and ( [ eq : ad6a ] ) . also , although the coefficients @xmath37 in eq .",

    "we set @xmath85 and apply the corgi approach to the resulting single - scale effective charge .",
    "we described how predictions are derived in these three approaches and corrected errors in the corgi method which were present in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we described how target mass and higher twist corrections affect these theoretical predictions and also how we evolve expressions for the moments through the @xmath138-quark threshold .",
    "we explained how the bernstein averages method eliminates any potential dependence of the analysis on missing data regions in @xmath4 and @xmath139 , and we also described how this method is generalized to treat both odd and even moments .",
    "we described the fitting procedure used to extract the optimal values of the qcd scale parameter and how we can implement various constraints which ensure that the results of this fitting are consistent with the structure functions being positive definite functions .",
    "we also presented an alternative , and slightly easier method for deriving the frs invariant quantities @xmath84 .",
    "the results of the corgi analysis presented in table [ t:1 ] show excellent agreement with the current global average for the strong coupling evaluated at @xmath140 @xcite , and are also in good agreement with fits based on the jacobi polynomial approach @xcite . from this",
    "we conclude that corgi perturbation theory performs well when applied to the analysis of moments . the analyses in which we include only odd or even moments are consistent with each other and with the full ( all moments ) analysis .",
    "furthermore , in the analysis in which we include all moments , the errors are greatly reduced .",
    "this improvement in the analysis is made possible by the availability of the full nnlo anomalous dimension calculation and represents significant improvement on previous analyses .    excluding data points for which @xmath141 leads to no significant change in the results and from this we conclude that the quark mass threshold method we have applied is suitable to the moment analysis . the error associated with the exclusion of higher - twist effects , given in eq .",
    "( [ eq:6:errbrea ] ) , is relatively small , signifying that these effects are not particularly important at scales @xmath142 .",
    "we include in the analysis positivity constraints on the moments ( eqs .",

    "( [ eq:6:chi ] ) .",
    "however , as we noted , ideally the full covariance matrix should be used in constructing @xmath145 to account for correlations between the bernstein averages used in the fits .",
    "unfortunately , we found that this matrix is ill - conditioned , having some eigenvalues close to zero , and so it proved to be numerically intractable to invert the matrix to construct the true @xmath145 .",
    "we therefore resorted to the same approximate rescaling of errors employed in refs.@xcite to try to compensate for possible correlations .",
    "the results also show consistency between corgi , ps and ec .",
    "the ps and ec analyses lead to values of @xmath12 and @xmath146 slightly lower than in the corgi analysis . however , this variation is well within the error bars on the associated quantities .",
    "inclusion of ht effects generally results in a small shift in @xmath12 of about 10 mev .",
    "however , when target mass corrections are included , we see a shift of approximately @xmath147 mev in the predicted value of @xmath12 and from this we conclude that these contributions are significant in the case of @xmath2",
    ".    an obvious further study would be to apply the same fitting procedure to the recently released nutev data @xcite . in future work",
    "we also hope to report on similar fits to data for the @xmath148 structure function @xcite .",
    "this analysis is considerably more complicated due to the presence of an additional singlet component .",
    "at around the same time as our paper was completed a related analysis of the ccfr data for @xmath21 also employing bernstein averages appeared @xcite .",
    "we would like to thank andreas vogt for providing us with computer code implementing the nnlo anomalous dimension coefficients of refs .",
    "@xcite , and also for helpful discussions on quark mass thresholds .",

    "<S> we use recently calculated next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) anomalous dimension coefficients for the moments of the @xmath0 structure function in @xmath1 scattering , together with the corresponding three - loop wilson coefficients , to obtain improved qcd predictions for both odd and even moments of @xmath2 . to investigate the issue of renormalization scheme dependence , the complete renormalization group improvement </S>",
    "<S> ( corgi ) approach is used , in which all dependence on renormalization and factorization scales is avoided by a complete resummation of rg - predictable scale logarithms . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider predictions using the method of effective charges , and compare with the standard ` physical scale ' choice . </S>",
    "<S> the bernstein polynomial method is used to construct experimental moments ( from the @xmath0 data of the ccfr collaboration ) that are insensitive to the value of @xmath3 in the region of @xmath4 which is inaccessible experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> direct fits for @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) are then performed . </S>",
    "<S> the corgi fits including target mass corrections give a value @xmath7 , consistent with the world average . </S>",
    "<S> the effective charge and physical scale fits give slightly smaller values , which are still consistent within the errors . </S>"
