    "atoms in optical lattices provide a powerful test bed for probing the properties of quantum systems in periodic potentials .",
    "several fundamental results have been reported including the observation of mott physics  @xcite , fermionic pairing  @xcite , and the fermionization of bosons in one dimension  @xcite .",
    "promising new research directions are emerging with the creation of dirac points in honeycomb lattices  @xcite and the achievement of single site resolution for probing and manipulating two dimensional ( 2d ) lattices  @xcite .",
    "a major objective in the study of atoms in optical lattices is to unravel the physics of quantum magnetism , and for this purpose it is crucial to be able to measure the spin correlations of the atoms efficiently .",
    "several methods have been suggested including bragg scattering  @xcite , time - of - flight measurements  @xcite , and light polarization experiments  @xcite .",
    "a complication for these methods is , however , that the experimental signal is small , and that one has to average over many experimental realizations .    to address this",
    ", we recently suggested a superlattice method which yields large macroscopic signatures of the spin correlations and allows for the detection of both short- and long - range correlations  @xcite .",
    "it is based on spin - dependent transport using a spin - selective raman excitation followed by the application of an additional moving superlattice potential .",
    "the spin - correlations can then be extracted by measuring the number of doubly occupied lattice sites .    in this paper",
    "we propose a similar but experimentally simpler method , which replaces the moving superlattice by a precisely timed period of free tunneling dynamics of the atoms followed by a measurement of the double occupancy .",
    "we analyze the spin dependence of the tunneling dynamics and show how this can be used to reveal the spin correlations in the initial state .",
    "the main result of our paper is the demonstration that timed measurements of the probability for double occupancy of the lattice sites yields distinct signatures of the magnetic correlations .",
    "importantly , the method we propose here does not require any spin dependence of the lattice potential and only utilizes only the optical lattice potential which is already present .",
    "this is a major advantage from an experimental perspective .",
    "we consider a gas of fermionic atoms in an optical lattice with equal populations in two internal states @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) , which we refer to as spin in the following . for strong repulsion and half - filling ,",
    "the gas is in the mott phase at low temperature @xmath2 which is well described by the heisenberg model  @xcite @xmath3 . \\label{heisenberg}\\ ] ] here , @xmath4 is the spin-@xmath5 operator for atoms at site @xmath6 , and @xmath7 denotes neighboring pairs . the interaction strength @xmath8 can exhibit a small anisotropy , quantified by the anisotropy parameter @xmath9 .",
    "a major incentive for studying atoms in optical lattices is to observe the phase transition to an antiferromagnetic ( af ) ordered state which occurs at @xmath10 in 3d for the isotropic ( @xmath11 ) heisenberg model  @xcite . to achieve this",
    ", one needs a sensitive experimental probe of the spin correlations .",
    "the key idea of the present paper is to access the spin correlation functions by inducing a difference in the tunneling dynamics of the two different spin states @xmath12 and @xmath13 as shown in the sketch of figure [ fig : timeevolution](a ) . to this end",
    ", we excite all @xmath12 atoms to their first excited vibrational state in the lattice sites while the @xmath14 atoms remain in the ground state  @xcite .",
    "this can be done experimentally by set of spin selective raman transitions on the vibrational sideband of an auxiliary state .",
    "then we simply allow the system to evolve for some time and subsequently measure the number of sites which are doubly occupied @xmath15 .",
    "since the tunneling to neighboring sites is larger for the first excited state than for the ground state , the @xmath14 atoms essentially remains at the initial lattice site as shown in figure [ fig : timeevolution](a ) . in practice",
    ", the number of doubly occupied sites can be counted by merging two atoms residing on the same lattice site to a molecule by application of a photo - association pulse or via a feshbach resonance.@xcite    in our theoretical modeling the lattice potential is held constant during the procedure and we assume that the interaction is tuned to a sufficiently weak value , for instance by using a feshbach resonance  @xcite , so that the system can be considered non - interacting during the tunneling dynamics .",
    "the three spatial components of the atomic wave function then evolve independently . assuming the motion in the @xmath16- and @xmath17-directions to be frozen by strong lattice potentials , it is sufficient to consider the dynamics along the @xmath18-direction , where the atoms are trapped by a periodic potential @xmath19 with @xmath20 the lattice constant",
    ". with this potential the single particle bloch eigenenergies @xmath21 and corresponding eigenfunctions @xmath22 are indexed by a vibrational state label @xmath23 and a bloch wavevector @xmath24 .",
    "the initial states are taken to be the wannier functions given by @xmath25 , which describe a localized state of the @xmath26th vibrational mode centered around lattice site @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "because the wannier functions are not eigenfunctions of the non - interacting lattice hamiltonian , they evolve over time . to describe this we introduce the transition matrix @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the creation operator for the wannier state @xmath30 and we use units for which @xmath31 .",
    "the time evolution operator @xmath32 is quadratic in @xmath33 and @xmath34 and diagonal in the vibrational quantum number @xmath26 since we assume the system to be non - interacting during the evolution .",
    "the matrix elements of this transition matrix read @xmath35 where @xmath36 represents the initial wannier function @xmath37 evolved for a time @xmath38 .",
    "we are mainly interested in the probability for a site @xmath39 to be doubly occupied @xmath40 .",
    "our proposed scheme is based on the fact that this probability can be expressed in terms of spin correlation functions of the initial state and the overlap matrix elements @xmath41  @xcite . since the @xmath42 atoms remain in the vibrational ground state @xmath43 while the @xmath44 atoms are transferred to the first excited state @xmath45",
    ", we write @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "then we obtain @xmath48 in the limit where the @xmath49 atoms do not move @xmath50 , eq .",
    "( [ pdeqn ] ) reduces to @xmath51 equations ( [ pdeqn ] ) and ( [ pdsimple ] ) demonstrate the direct link between the observed double occupancy and the spin correlation function @xmath52 describing af ordering in the initial state .",
    "we now present our numerical results .",
    "the spin correlation functions @xmath53 for the initial state determined by the 3d heisenberg model ( [ heisenberg ] ) are obtained from full quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations using the stochastic series expansion method @xcite with directed - loop updates @xcite . the subsequent time evolution after the @xmath12 atoms",
    "are excited to the first vibrational state is then calculated by numerical diagonalization of the non - interacting hamiltonian taking the motion to be along a single direction . as an example , we will here present results for a 1d lattice with @xmath54 sites and a lattice height @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the recoil energy with @xmath57 the atom mass .",
    "the numerical diagonalization is performed using a lattice unit cell consisting of 1028 real - space points .",
    "we first consider the time evolution of a single atom .",
    "figurew [ fig : timeevolution](b ) and [ fig : timeevolution](c ) depicts the probability @xmath58 of a @xmath0 atom which starts at @xmath59 at site @xmath60 , to be at site @xmath27 at time @xmath38 .",
    "we see that for the parameters chosen , the @xmath49 atoms do not move but remain at their initial position ( fig .",
    "[ fig : timeevolution](b ) ) whereas the @xmath61 atoms move ( fig .",

    "this time depends exponentially on the lattice height , and we indeed find @xmath64 for deep lattices .",
    "thus , by adjusting the lattice depth one can tune the time scale of the probe .",
    "it is , however , important that the lattice depth is sufficiently deep so that only the @xmath61 atoms move .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : times ] ( right ) where we plot @xmath65 , which represents the probability that a @xmath66 has moved after the @xmath67 tunneling time @xmath62 .",

    "we now analyze the evolution of the double occupancy , @xmath69 starting from a correlated initial state determined by the 3d heisenberg model .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd2 ] .     as a function time @xmath38 at different temperatures @xmath2 for the slightly anisotropic heisenberg system ( @xmath70 ) and a lattice depth @xmath55 . ]",
    "we focus first on the non - interacting case corresponding to @xmath71 which is plotted as the solid line forming the boundary to the grey area . for this case ,",
    "the spins are uncorrelated and @xmath72 .",
    "since the vibrational ground state is essentially immobile @xmath73 for all the relevant times , we find .",
    "hence for a half - filled non - interacting system , @xmath69 can not be larger than @xmath74 and will in general be lower because of the non - vanishing probability that the @xmath61 atoms return to their initial states .",
    "the oscillations in @xmath69 for uncorrelated atoms are therefore directly linked to the oscillations in @xmath75 which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : timeevolution ] .",
    "since the tunneling time @xmath62 gives the time for the first minimum of @xmath76 , it corresponds to the first maximum of @xmath69 . at this minimum , @xmath77 and the value of @xmath69 at the first maximum is therefore very close to @xmath74 , which is also the long time uncorrelated value .",
    "we now turn to @xmath69 for finite temperature also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd2 ] .",
    "we have chosen a slightly anisotropic heisenberg system with @xmath78 , which forces the staggered magnetization to be along the z - axis .",
    "the af correlations are clearly visible as increased oscillations of @xmath69 as a function of time which is the main result of the present paper . in particular , note that the probability @xmath69 is _ larger _ than @xmath74 for certain times which is a clear sign of af ordering . to analyze this effect further , we consider the high temperature regime @xmath79 with @xmath80 , where @xmath81 with @xmath82 the kronecker delta function connecting neighbor sites . using this in eq .",
    "( [ pdsimple ] ) we get @xmath83 for @xmath84 .",
    "equation ( [ pdhight ] ) clearly illustrates how af correlations can increase @xmath69 ; for example as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : timeevolution ] at @xmath85 , we have that @xmath86 and @xmath87 such that @xmath88 .",
    "as the temperature is lowered , the oscillations of @xmath69 becomes larger reflecting the increasing af correlations .",
    "we note that the oscillations of @xmath69 increase significantly when @xmath89 where the system is in the broken symmetry phase .",
    "this is particularly visible for the later times which indicates the onset of long - range order .",
    "this effect is illustrated further in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd ] , where we plot the difference @xmath90 between the probabilities for finite and infinite temperatures .     between the interacting and non - interacting cases as a function of time @xmath38 and temperature @xmath2 . ]    -space dependence of the norm square of the transfer matrix elements @xmath91 for the first excited state shown at selected times .",
    "note how the timed tunneling dynamics allows to probe the spin structures other than @xmath92 , which is relevant for af ordering , like the two examples shown here which mainly probe @xmath93 and @xmath94 ordered states . ]",
    "we see that for the oscillations at later times , the difference increases significantly for @xmath95 when long - range order sets in , although the absolute size of the difference is rather small .",
    "note also the two dips at @xmath96 and @xmath97 which shows up as long - range correlations set in at @xmath98 . from fig .",
    "[ fig : pd ] one can also see that short - range correlations leave a signature at @xmath99 , for example yielding an af signal at @xmath100 of @xmath101 .",
    "in summary , we have demonstrated how to detect antiferromagnetic spin correlations in optical lattices by utilizing the difference in the tunneling dynamics of the two lowest lying vibrational states of the atomic wave - functions .",
    "measurement of the number of doubly occupied sites yields a macroscopic signature of the magnetic correlations which is proportional to the number of lattice sites . below the critical temperature @xmath102 the method has large signatures @xmath103 as a result of the spin correlations .",
    "the method presented here is particularly relevant for measuring short range correlations as it provides an easily accessible experimental method , which requires a minimal change of the experimental setups already present . for measuring long range correlations",
    "the method is less suited as the spreading of the wave function for long times introduces an uncertainty in the correlation function measured .",
    "such long correlation can thus be measured more precisely with different schemes , for instance relying on superlattice potentials  @xcite .",
    "here we have mainly focussed on the detection of antiferromagnetic correlations , but the method may also be used to probe other spin ordered states . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ft ] we show the @xmath24-space representation of @xmath104 for three different selected times .",
    "as seen , by selecting appropriate times a magnetic ordering with periodicities of , for example , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , can also be probed .",
