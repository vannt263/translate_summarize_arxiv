    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) have been playing an important role in modern cosmology .",
    "early observations of sne ia at redshift @xmath9 strongly suggest that the expansion of the universe at the present time is accelerating ( riess et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ) . since then",
    ", the nature of dark energy ( with negative pressure ) that drives cosmic acceleration has been one of the greatest mysteries in modern cosmology ( for reviews see peebles & ratra 2003 ; padmanabhan 2003 ) .",
    "recent observations of 16 higher - redshift ( up to @xmath10 ) sne ia present conclusive evidence that the universe had once been decelerating ( riess et al .",
    "these newly - discovered objects , together with previous reported sne ia , have been used to provide further constraints on both the expansion history of the universe and the equation of state ( eos ) of a dark energy component ( riess et al .",
    "2004 ; wang & tegmark 2004 ; daly & djorgovski 2004 ; feng , wang & zhang 2004 ) .",
    "@xmath1-ray bursts ( grbs ) are the brightest electromagnetic explosions in the universe .",
    "it has been widely believed that they should be detectable out to very high redshifts ( lamb & reichart 2000 ; ciardi & loeb 2000 ; bromm & loeb 2002 ) . @xmath1-ray photons with energy from tens of kev to mev , if produced at high redshifts , suffer from no extinction before they are detected .",
    "these advantages would make grbs an attractive probe of the universe .",
    "schaefer ( 2003 ) derived the luminosity distances of 9 grbs with known redshifts by using two luminosity indicators ( the spectral lag and the variability ) .",
    "he obtained the first grb hubble diagram with the @xmath6 constraint on the mass density @xmath11 .",
    "a correlation between the isotropic - equivalent @xmath1-ray energy ( @xmath12 ) and the @xmath4 peak energy ( @xmath3 ) in the local observer frame , @xmath13 , was discovered by bepposax observations ( amati et al .",
    "2002 ; yonetoku et al .",
    "2004 ) , and confirmed by hete-2 observations ( sakamoto et al . 2004 ; lamb et al .",
    "it not only holds among batse grbs ( lloyd - ronning & ramirez - ruiz 2002 ) but also within one grb ( liang , dai & wu 2004 ) .",
    "its possible explanations include the synchrotron mechanism in relativistic shocks ( zhang & mszros 2002 ; dai & lu 2002 ) and the emission from off - axis relativistic jets ( yamazaki , ioka & nakamura 2004 ; eichler & levinson 2004 ) . however , the dispersion around this correlation is too large to obtain useful information on the universe from the current grb sample .",
    "ghirlanda , ghisellini & lazzati ( 2004 ) recently found a new relationship between the beaming - corrected @xmath1-ray energy ( @xmath2 ) and the local - observer peak energy , @xmath0 , with a small scatter for current grb data , suggesting that grbs are a promising probe of the universe . in principle , this relationship can be derived from the @xmath13 correlation combined with the afterglow jet model . in this letter , we constrain the mass density of the universe and the nature of dark energy by considering this relationship with a sample of 12 grbs with known redshift , peak energy , and break time of afterglow light curves .",
    "we show that grbs appear to provide an independent and interesting probe of fundamental quantities of the universe .",
    "by searching for grbs in the literature , we have found total 14 bursts of which redshift @xmath14 , observed peak energy @xmath15 , and break time @xmath16 of afterglow light curves are available .",
    "table 1 lists a sample of 12 grbs , but the other two events , grbs 990510 and 030226 , are not included .",
    "the reason is as follows : the analysis of this letter and ghirlanda et al .",
    "( 2004 ) is based on the afterglow jet model ( rhoads 1999 ; sari , piran & halpern 1999 ) . in this model , a relativistic jet , after emitting a fraction @xmath17 of its kinetic energy into prompt @xmath1 rays , expands in a homogeneous medium with number density of @xmath18 . as the jet sweeps up more and more medium matter , its lorentz factor declines .",
    "when the lorentz factor equals the inverse of the jet s half opening angle @xmath19 , the afterglow light curve presents a break .",
    "however , this model can not well fit the afterglow data of these two bursts , because the predicted break spans about two orders of magnitude in time when light travel time effects are taken into account , and thus the theoretical light curve is too smooth to be consistent with the observed sharpness ( rhoads & fruchter 2001 ; wei & lu 2002 ) . for grb 990510",
    ", the required spectral index of the electrons is less than 2 , being inconsistent with the shock acceleration theory ( wei & lu 2002 ) .",
    "in addition , the afterglow data of grb 030226 suggest that its environment might be a low - density wind rather than a constant - density medium , also conflicting with the model ( dai & wu 2003 ) .    according to the afterglow jet model ( sari et al .",
    "1999 ) , the jet s half opening angle is given by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 ( frail et al . 2001 ) .",
    "only for few bursts in table 1 the medium density was obtained from broadband modelling of the afterglow emission ( e.g. , panaitescu & kumar 2002 ) . for those bursts with unknown @xmath18 , we assume the median density @xmath25 as in ghirlanda et al .",
    "the isotropic - equivalent @xmath1-ray energy of a grb is calculated by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the fluence ( in units of erg@xmath28 ) received in some observed bandpass and @xmath29 is the factor that corrects the observed fluence to the standard rest - frame bandpass ( 1-@xmath30 kev ) ( bloom , frail & sari 2001 ) . for a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmology with mass density",
    "@xmath31 and vacuum energy density @xmath32 , the luminosity distance in equation ( 1 ) is @xmath33^{-1/2}\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the speed of light and @xmath35 is the present hubble constant ( carroll , press & turner 1992 ) . in equation",
    "( 2 ) , @xmath36 , and ",
    "sinn \" is sinh for @xmath37 and sin for @xmath38 . for @xmath39 , equation ( 2 )",
    "turns out to be @xmath40 times the integral . in this section ,",
    "we assume a flat universe ( i.e. , @xmath39 ) because of both an expected consequence of inflation and the observed characteristic angular size scale of the cosmic microwave background fluctuations ( spergel et al . 2003 and references therein ) .    from equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) ,",
    "we obtain the beaming - corrected @xmath1-ray energy @xmath41 , that is , @xmath42 figure 1 plots @xmath2 versus @xmath3 for the grb sample listed in table 1 , with @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "we find that @xmath2 and @xmath3 are strongly correlated with a correlation coefficient @xmath46 ( with a probability of @xmath47 ) .",
    "the best fit is @xmath48 with a reduced @xmath49 .",
    "we note this power to be insensitive to @xmath31 .",
    "in addition , although the peak energy @xmath3 and the low - energy spectral index @xmath50 in table 1 appear to evolve with redshift ( amati et al . 2002 ) , this evolution does nt affect the above relation as shown in figure 1 .",
    "these results imply that grbs are standard candles .",
    "we first derive the observed luminosity distance from the grb sample . considering a relationship @xmath51 ( where @xmath52 is a dimensionless parameter ) , we obtain @xmath53 where @xmath54 is in units of kev .",
    "thus , the observed distance modulus of a grb is @xmath55 with an error of @xmath56^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 are the errors in the peak energy , fluence , break time and medium density of the grb , respectively .",
    "we plot a hubble diagram of our grb sample in figure 2 based on equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) .",
    "this figure also presents a hubble diagram of the current sne ia sample .",
    "both hubble diagrams are consistent with each other .",
    "grbs and sne ia have mean uncertainties of @xmath61 and @xmath62 in the log of the distance , respectively , and thus grbs are about twice worse in accuracy than sne .    for an frw cosmology with @xmath31 and @xmath32 , equation ( 2 )",
    "gives the theoretical distance modulus @xmath63 .",
    "the likelihood for these cosmological parameters can be determined from a @xmath64 statistic , where @xmath65 ^ 2}{\\sigma_{\\mu_{{\\rm ob},i}}^2}.\\ ] ] we consider all possible values of the parameters @xmath66 and @xmath52 to be @xmath67 ( bennett et al . 2003 ) and @xmath68 ( see  2 ) . the confidence regions in the @xmath31-@xmath32 plane can be found through marginalizing the likelihood functions over @xmath66 and @xmath52 ( i.e. , integrating the probability density @xmath69 for all values of @xmath66 and @xmath52 ) .",
    "we plot contours of likelihood ( from @xmath6 to @xmath70 ) for unknown curvature @xmath71 in figure 3 . as shown for a flat universe , with the current sample , @xmath72 ( at the @xmath73 confidence level ) , and the @xmath6 contour contains the @xmath74 point corresponding to the  concordance \" model .",
    "we measure @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "there are several alternative approaches to calculate the luminosity distance ( also see riess et al .",
    "we here consider a flat universe and a constant eos , @xmath75 , of a dark energy component ( garnavich et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ) . in this case",
    "we have @xmath76^{-1/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] figure 4 presents contours of likelihood in the @xmath31-@xmath7 plane ( after marginalizing over @xmath66 and @xmath52 ) .",
    "the solid contours consider a prior of @xmath77 by assuming its gaussian distribution , similar to riess et al .",
    "we see @xmath8 ( @xmath6 ) , which is consistent with the value of @xmath7 expected for a cosmological constant ( i.e. , @xmath78 ) .",
    "the @xmath0 relationship with a small dispersion was reported by ghirlanda et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and confirmed in this letter .",
    "the advantages of considering this relationship as a probe of the universe are ( 1 ) that grbs have been detected at redshifts up to @xmath79 , ( 2 ) that @xmath1 rays suffer from no extinction , and ( 3 ) that we do nt think of luminosity evolution .",
    "these advantages led us to constrain the mass density of the universe and the nature of dark energy .",
    "we found that the mass density @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) for a flat universe with a cosmological constant , and the @xmath7 parameter of the dark - energy eos @xmath8 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "riess et al . ( 2004 ) measured @xmath80 and @xmath81 ( @xmath6 ) for the current sne ia sample",
    ". therefore , our results are consistent with those from sne ia .",
    "the upcoming _ swift _ satellite with an energy range of @xmath82 kev will be scheduled for launch in 2004 september ( gehrels et al .",
    "_ swift _ is expected ( 1 ) to detect more than 100 bursts per year , ( 2 ) to observe x - ray and uv / optical afterglows at times of 1 minute to several days after the burst , and ( 3 ) to detect very - high - redshift grbs .",
    "thus , it is expected that a larger sample of grbs established by _",
    "swift _ provides a further probe of the universe .",
    "such a probe opens up a new window on the cosmic distance scale far beyond the reach of sne ia .",
    "we call this research field _",
    "grb cosmology _ , corresponding to the well - known supernova cosmology .",
