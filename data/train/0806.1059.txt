    "many of the objects known to reside in the solar neighborhood were discovered via their high proper motion .",
    "early proper motion surveys by the pioneers of photographic astrometry built the foundation of our knowledge about the local stellar census ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "discoveries of our nearest stellar and substellar neighbors continue to - date , with surveys such as the sips survey @xcite , the lehpm survey @xcite , the scr survey @xcite , and the superblink survey @xcite . despite their successes ,",
    "these surveys are not ideally suited to the discovery of nearby brown dwarfs because of their dependence on optical data . as we have now learned from longer - wavelength surveys such as the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; @xcite ) , the deep near infrared survey of the southern sky ( denis ; @xcite ) , and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) , the solar neighborhood is home to many l and t dwarfs  the coldest brown dwarfs currently known @xcite .",
    "most of these cool objects have been selected photometrically using color selections appropriate for l and t dwarfs with near solar metallicity .",
    "this method may be missing low - temperature objects with unusual physical properties  low or high metallicity dwarfs or objects with unusual atmospheric traits  but a measurement of their high motions will help to identify them as nearby .",
    "another benefit of proper motion surveys over photometric ones is their ability to find nearby objects against the confusion of the galactic plane . due to reddening caused by intervening material ,",
    "extinguished background objects in the plane can have colors mimicking those of nearby dwarfs in 2mass , denis , and sdss colors .",
    "proper motions help ferret out these nearby interlopers without relying on color information .    using data contained in the 2mass survey working databases , we have searched for proper motion objects by examining the subset of multi - epoch data having time differences in excess of two months .",
    "the total coverage satisfying this criterion is approximately 4700 square degrees , or @xmath011% of the sky . in this paper",
    "we present two discoveries from this exclusively near - infrared search .",
    "both objects are optically faint , nearby l dwarfs located within 15@xmath9 of the galactic plane and hence missed by previous optical proper motion and near - infrared photometric surveys .",
    "we briefly describe our 2mass proper motion search and measurements from the 2mass catalog in @xmath102 , along with the observations ; we give the analysis in @xmath103 ; discussion in @xmath104 ; and conclusions in @xmath105 .",
    "we have conducted a near - infrared ( nir ) proper motion search using the 2mass database for high proper motion and late - type , optically faint objects @xcite .",
    "2mass was designed to be a single epoch survey covering the entire sky , but for various quality control or scientific reasons , multiple regions of the sky were observed more than once , totalling @xmath04700 sq degrees of sky observed over at least two epochs . we briefly describe our search criteria here ; a complete description of the survey will be presented in a forthcoming publication ( kirkpatrick et al@xmath11 , in prep ) .",
    "candidates were required to have @xmath12  @xmath2  15.8 , have no optical counterparts ( @xmath13- and @xmath14-bands ) within 5@xmath15 in the usno - b1 catalog @xcite , have positional differences of 0@xmath16x@xmath175 between the first and last epochs , have first and last epoch time differences of @xmath18 t  @xmath19  0.2 yr , proper motions of @xmath202 yr@xmath8 , and be located at least 10 degrees away from the galactic plane .",
    "after this initial query , candidates were examined visually using charts constructed from 2mass @xmath12 , @xmath4 , and @xmath21 bands ; digitized sky survey ( dss ) i @xmath14 , @xmath13 , or @xmath22-band ; and dss ii @xmath14-band .",
    "dss i and ii images were obtained from the cadc service .",
    "those without visible counterparts in the dss i or ii images or , for particularly bright objects with large @xmath23 colors ( @xmath24 ) , were selected for follow - up spectroscopy . here we present two noteworthy objects selected for early follow - up based on their bright 2mass magnitudes .",
    "the first candidate has a 2mass all sky point source catalog designation of 2mass j18212815 + 1414010 , hereafter abbreviated 2mass j1821 + 1414 .",
    "astrometric and photometric measurements from the two separate epochs listed in the 2mass survey point source working database are given in table 1 . despite this object having bright @xmath12-band ( 13.43  @xmath6  0.03 ) and @xmath21-band ( 11.65  @xmath6  0.03 ) magnitudes , it is invisible in the dss i @xmath13-band and dss ii @xmath14-band plates .",

    "its large implied optical - to - infrared color along with a @xmath5 color of 1.78  @xmath6  0.04 suggest that it is a mid - to late - type l dwarf . using the two available 2mass epochs and a positional error estimate of 0@xmath2606",

    "both objects lie along the redward extension of late - type m to l dwarfs .    in the following sections we describe observations of 2mass 1821 + 1414 and 2mass j2148 + 4003 carried out using subaru - focas , keck - nirspec , irtf - spex , and spitzer - irs along with data reductions .",
    "the summary for all observations can be found in table 2 .",
    "the optical spectroscopic observations were carried out on 20 and 21 aug 2007 ( ut ) at the subaru telescope on mauna kea , hawaii , using the faint object camera and spectrograph ( focas ; @xcite ) .",
    "focas was used with the 300r grating blazed at 7500   and the s058 filter to block second - order light from wavelengths shorter than 5800  .",
    "the grating tilt was set so that the wavelength region from 5850 to 10250   was covered .",
    "use of a long slit of width @xmath27 resulted in a resolution of 8.5  .",
    "both nights were clear but the seeing was variable over the course of both nights .",
    "on 20 aug 2007 the seeing varied from @xmath28 to @xmath29 . on 21 aug 2007",
    "the seeing was somewhat more stable , ranging only from @xmath30 to @xmath31 .",
    "subaru employs an atmospheric dispersion corrector , so keeping the slit aligned with the parallactic angle was not necessary .",
    "the data were reduced and calibrated using standard iraf routines .",
    "the overscan region of the array was used for bias subtraction , and a median of five dome flats taken on the first night was used to normalize the response of the detector . because of strong , broad spectral signatures in the flat field lamps themselves , special care was needed during the flat field correction step .",
    "the focas chip is designed to be used with multi - object spectroscopy , but for our single - slit observations most of the detector area is not used or needed for sky subtraction .",
    "this allowed us to perform a block average ( in the spatial dimension ) on a much smaller 21@xmath323260 pixel region of the median dome flat corresponding to the area where the primary target spectrum and sky subtraction region would fall in subsequent exposures .",
    "this block - averaged , one - dimensional , vertical slice encompasses the gross undulations of the dome flat in the spectral dimension , and we replicated this slice across the spatial dimension to create a two - dimensional image .",
    "this image was then divided back into the median flat to produce a map that contains only small - scale flat - field variations .",
    "this map was then normalized using imsurfit and divided into all other data frames to remove the flat field signature across the detector .",
    "the individual stellar spectra were then extracted using the apall package .",
    "wavelength calibration was achieved using arc lamps taken after each program object .",
    "spectra were flux calibrated using an observation of ltt 9491 ( @xcite ) taken on the first night .",
    "we checked this fluxing using another standard , wolf 1346 ( @xcite ) , taken on the second night and the agreement was excellent .",
    "dwarfs of type g0 were also acquired after each program target , and these were used to correct for telluric absorption in the program objects .",
    "specifically , the g0 dwarf sao 10356 was used for 2mass j1821 + 1414 and the g0 dwarf sao 207827 was used for 2mass j2148 + 4003 .",

    "the spectra of 2mass j2148 + 4003 , 2mass j1821 + 1414 , and 2mass j2224@xmath360158 all exhibit a broad absorption feature from 911 @xmath7 m that is absent ( or rather , weak ) in the spectrum of 2mass j1507@xmath361627 .",

    "the discovery of these two objects has increased the number of l dwarfs within 10 pc by @xmath025% , a substantial increase in this nearest census of the solar neighborhood .",
    "however , we are not taking into account malmquist bias when discussing the number of objects within 10 pc .",
    "these two discoveries have arisen because of the sky coverage of our proper motion survey extending into a relatively unexplored part of the galactic plane ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "all available evidence indicates that 2mass j1821 + 1414 and 2mass j2148 + 4003 have unusually dusty photospheres  their unusual red slopes throughout the @xmath52- , @xmath53- , and @xmath12-bands , overall red nir colors , weak h@xmath33o absorption , and the presence of silicate absorption at 911 @xmath7 m . the wavelength dependence of dust absorption and scattering ( i.e. , dust extinction ) causes an object to appear redder than expected , because shorter wavelength light is attenuated and scattered more than longer wavelength light . for absorption bands that form in atmospheric layers near or below the cloud deck ( e.g. , the h@xmath33o absorption bands at @xmath53- and @xmath12-band )",
    ", the additional opacity provided by the condensates limits the depth in the atmosphere from which radiation can escape and thus weakens their relative strengths .",
    "the atmospheric layers above the cloud decks are also warmed due to the presence of the condensate clouds .",
    "absorption lines ( e.g. , k i ) and bands ( e.g. , h@xmath33o ) that form in these atmospheric layers are therefore also weakened .",
    "lastly , the flattening seen from 911 @xmath7 m in the spectra of 2mass j1821 + 1414 and 2mass j2148 + 4003 is likely due to a higher bulk content of silicate dust grains in the atmosphere or from smaller grain sizes than are typical for field l dwarfs . in the next section ,",
    "we suggest two underlying physical causes for dusty photospheres .",
    "below , we offer four possible explanations for the peculiar spectral features of 2mass j1821 + 1414 and 2mass j2148 + 4003 , two of which may lead to dusty photospheres :    * ( 1 ) unresolved binarity : * in the case of 2mass j2148 + 4003 , we can eliminate the possibility of unresolved binarity being the underlying cause for its extreme red color ( @xmath5=2.38 ) .",
    "the composite @xmath5 color of a binary results in a color intermediate between the two components and so the composite can not be redder than either individual member .",
    "since 2mass j2148 + 4003 is one of only seven l or t dwarfs with @xmath56  2.3 , out of 648 objects , two ordinary l or t dwarf components would necessarily be bluer and could not combine to produce a redder composite .    also , no known combination of l+l or l+t dwarfs can reproduce the triangular - shaped @xmath4-band present in the spectra of 2mass j1821 + 1414 and 2mass j2148 + 4003 ( see figure 4 of @xcite ) , so we must account for these features in some other way .    *",
    "( 2 ) interstellar reddening : * interstellar material , because of its wavelength - dependent extinction properties , can cause the spectral energy distribution of a background star seen through it to be artificially reddened .",
    "however , the proper motions of these two objects alone imply that they are nearby and well within the `` local bubble '' @xcite ; hence , there is no significant amount of interstellar material expected to be between us and these dwarfs .    *",
    "( 3 ) unusual metallicity : * is it possible that these two objects represent unusually low- or high - metallicity l dwarfs ?",
    "several low metallicity l dwarfs have already been catalogued , the most relevant examples being the sdl4 2mass j16262034 + 3925190 ( hereafter 2mass j1626 + 3925 ; @xcite ) and the sdl7 2mass j05325346 + 8246465 ( hereafter 2mass j0532 + 8246 ; @xcite ) . in both cases",
    "these objects are much bluer , not redder , than field l dwarfs of the same type , the 2mass @xmath5 values being @xmath360.03@xmath60.08 mag and 0.26@xmath60.16 mag for 2mass j1626 + 3925 and 2mass j0532 + 8246 , respectively .",
    "moreover , the near - infrared spectra of these objects do not show spectra that are sharply peaked at the long - wavelength side of @xmath4-band , as seen in 2mass j1821 + 1414 and 2mass j2148 + 4003 , but instead show @xmath4-band spectra that are very rounded .",
    "high metallicity may imply greater dust production since more metals are available to condense onto grains .",
    "we examine gaia models of high metallicity z  =  [ fe / h ]  =  0.5 versus solar metallicity z  =  0.0 in figure  [ zmodels ] .",
    "the cases shown in this figure are for effective temperatures and surface gravities typical for mid - type l dwarfs . at a fixed t@xmath57 and surface gravity , the metal - rich models have overall redder spectra , weaker feh absorption , weaker na i and k i absorption , weaker h@xmath33o absorption , and a red - shifted @xmath39-band peak compared to the solar - metallicity models .",
    "these are the same differences noted between the two l dwarfs reported here , 2mass j1821 + 1414 and 2mass j2148 + 4003 , and typical mid - to late - type l dwarfs .",
    "it is possible that these two objects could be metal - rich , causing the spectroscopic peculiarities noted here .    *",
    "( 4 ) unusual gravity : * high gravity is not favored because it gives rise to near - infrared spectra that are bluer than normal and have spectral peaks in @xmath4- and @xmath39-bands that are rounded in appearance due to increased collision induced absorption by h@xmath33 ( cia h@xmath33 ) .",
    "cia h@xmath33 dominates the absorption at @xmath4- and @xmath39-bands @xcite and increases in strength with higher pressures .",
    "low gravity , however , creates just the opposite effect . as explained in @xcite , low gravity results in lower atmospheric pressures , diminishing the relative importance of cia h@xmath33 . with less competing opacity at @xmath4-band and especially at @xmath39-band",
    ", flux can more easily emerge at these wavelengths , making such low - gravity objects redder in nir ( @xmath58 ) colors .",
    "lower gravity may also tend to retard the precipitation of condensates from the atmosphere , leading to thicker clouds , more condensate opacity , and redder nir colors .",
    "reduced cia h@xmath33 and/or increased condensate opacity are likely responsible for the triangular - shaped @xmath4-band spectra characteristic of low - gravity , late - type m and early - type l dwarfs seen both in young clusters ( e.g. , orion : @xcite ; cha ii , rho oph : @xcite ) and associations ( e.g. , @xcite ; twa : @xcite ) .    both 2mass j1821 + 1414 and",
    "2mass j2148 + 4003 have @xmath4-band spectral morphologies similar to low - gravity objects .",
    "other gravity diagnostics such as atomic k i line strengths and feh absorption @xcite may support this hypothesis . in figure  [ k1lines ] , we plot the line strengths of k i at 1.169 , 1.178 , & 1.253 @xmath7 m for 2mass j1821 + 1414 and 2mass j2148 + 4003 in comparison to other l dwarfs , using our keck - nirspec data .",
    "the k i line strengths of 2mass j1821 + 1414 and 2mass j2148 + 4003 are weaker than those of other l dwarfs of similar spectral type but are not as extreme outliers as the possibly low - gravity l dwarf 2mass j2244 + 2043 .",
    "similarly , the @xmath12-feh flux ratio , defined by @xcite , show somewhat weaker feh absorption in 2mass j1821 + 1414 and comparable feh absorption in 2mass j2148 + 4003 as in normal l dwarfs of similar spectral type ( see figure  [ fehlines ] ) .",
    "2mass j2244 + 2043 , on the other hand , shows markedly weaker feh absorption .",
    "the weaker atomic lines seen in the spectra of 2mass j1821 + 1414 and 2mass j2148 + 4003 could also be a consequence of the higher opacity caused by thick dust clouds in their atmospheres , as explained in @xmath104.1 .",
    "based on their spectrophotometric distance estimates of 10 pc , we calculate the tangential velocities for both objects ( see table 4 ) .",
    "2mass j1821 + 1414 has a low v@xmath59 of @xmath010 km s@xmath8 , suggesting that it could indeed be young .",

    "no photometric measurements of 2mass j1821 + 1414 and 2mass j2148 + 4003 in the 5.215.3 @xmath7 m range were taken , but @xcite have shown that the absolute flux calibrations are good to @xmath03% . since no data was available shortward of @xmath00.6 @xmath7 m , we interpolated between the flux level at 0.6 @xmath7 m and a flux level of zero at 0 @xmath7 m .",
    "longwards of 14.5 @xmath7 m , we connected a raleigh - jeans tail .",
    "the bolometric luminosity was then computed by integrating underneath this sed and assuming distances of 9.8  @xmath6  1.3 pc and 9.9  @xmath6  1.3 pc for 2mass j1821 + 1414 and 2mass j2148 + 4003 , respectively ( see table 4 ) .",
    "note that , although 2mass j2148 + 4003 has a nearly identical distance estimate as 2mass j1821 + 1414 ( @xmath010 pc ) and has a later spectral type , its apparent bolometric magnitude is _ brighter _ than 2mass j1821 + 1414 , indicating that it is actually closer than 2mass j1821 + 1414 .",
    "this is not surprising if this object does have a much dustier atmosphere , causing an abnormally faint @xmath12-band flux compared to typical l6 dwarfs . since the spectrophotometric distance estimate we used is based on @xmath12-band , this would overestimate the distance to this object . in comparison",

    "both objects have overall red spectral energy distributions , weak h@xmath33o bands , slightly triangular - shaped @xmath4-band continua , and silicate absorption at 911 @xmath7 m .",
    "these features are likely due to unusually thick dust clouds in their atmospheres .",
    "while the underlying cause for this dust is uncertain , we suggest that it may arise from a metal - rich atmosphere or a lower surface gravity , the latter implying a young age .",
