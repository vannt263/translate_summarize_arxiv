    "spatially homogeneous cosmological models with a perfect fluid subject to the equation of state @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is a constant satisfying @xmath4 ) was studied and it was found that when @xmath5 , and particularly for realistic matter with @xmath6 , the scaling solutions are unstable ; essentially they are unstable to curvature perturbations , although they are stable to shear perturbations .",
    "in addition , in @xcite homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes with non - zero spatial curvature were studied .",
    "it is clearly of interest to study more general cosmological models .",
    "one class of models of particular interest are those with _ positive spatial curvature_. these models have attracted less attention since they are more complicated mathematically .",
    "positive - curvature friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) models @xcite , kantowski - sachs models @xcite and bianchi type ix models @xcite have been studied using qualitative methods , although rigorous analyses using a new set of compact variables have not been carried out .",

    "recently @xcite positive - curvature frw models and kantowski - sachs models with a perfect fluid and a cosmological constant have been investigated using qualitative methods and utilizing compactified variables .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "we shall first comprehensively study the qualitative properties of the class of positive - curvature frw models with a barotropic fluid and a non - interacting scalar field with an exponential potential , extending and generalising work by turner @xcite , who used different basic variables .",
    "we shall then analyse the qualitative properties of the kantowski - sachs models .",
    "positive - curvature frw models and kantowski - sachs models belong to the class of spherically symmetric models , and hence the present work is a natural extension of recent work @xcite .",
    "indeed , it turns out that understanding the dynamics of the kantowski - sachs models is crucial for understanding the global dynamics of general spherically symmetric similarity models @xcite .",
    "the matter content of the models is taken to be a perfect fluid and a scalar field with exponential potential .",
    "the corresponding energy - momentum tensor is @xmath7 where @xmath0 is a non - negative constant , and the pressure is given by @xmath2 , with the equation - of - state parameter in the range @xmath8 . the fluid energy density @xmath9 and the scalar field @xmath10 are functions of a timelike coordinate @xmath11 .",
    "a dot denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath11 and throughout units are used in which @xmath12 .",
    "the matter components are assumed to be non - coupled , and thus they are separately conserved : @xmath13 for convenience , we define @xmath14",
    "we start our investigation of closed cosmological models with a perfect fluid and a scalar field by looking at the closed frw models .",
    "the line element for these models can be written @xmath15 the expansion of the fluid congruence is given by @xmath16 , and the evolution equation for the curvature @xmath17 is @xmath18 the conservation equations yield @xmath19 from the field equations we obtain @xmath20    \\label{eq : friedmannfrw},\\\\     \\dot{\\theta}&=&-\\frac{1}{3}\\left\\{\\theta^2+\\frac{1}{2}d^2 +    \\frac{3}{2}\\left[3x^2 - 3v+3(\\gamma-1)\\mu\\right]\\right\\ } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] assuming @xmath21 , the friedmann equation , eq .",

    "note also that for @xmath40 , @xmath41 so that @xmath42 whenever @xmath43 in which case @xmath44 is itself monotonic . when @xmath38 , that is in the inflationary region , @xmath44 need not be monotonic  for example , see the orbits close to @xmath45 in figs .",

    "consequently there can be no periodic or recurrent orbits in the interior state space and global results can be deduced .",

    "indeed , the existence of the monotonic function ensures that there are no periodic orbits and that generically orbits asymptote towards the local attractors ( sinks and sources ) .",
