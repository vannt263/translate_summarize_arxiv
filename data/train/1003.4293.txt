    "during the past four years , the quasar 3c  454.3 ( z=0.859 ) has displayed pronounced variability at all wavelengths . in spring 2005",
    "it returned to the night sky with unprecedented brightness , @xmath312.0  mag , a level not seen at optical wavelengths over at least 50 years of observations @xcite .",
    "an increase in activity occurred at x - ray and radio wavelengths as well , with the 230 ghz radio variations having a delay of @xmath42  months with respect to the optical variability @xcite .",
    "this prominent outburst was followed by a more quiescent period at all wavebands from spring 2006 to spring 2007 . during this interval , the optical spectrum possessed characteristics typical of radio - quiet active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , such as a `` big blue bump '' and `` little blue bump , '' attributed to thermal emission from the accretion disk and broad emission lines from surrounding clouds , respectively @xcite .",
    "after the quiescent state , the quasar underwent a new stage of high optical activity @xcite that continued to the end of 2008 . during this time span ,",
    "very bright @xmath2-ray emission was detected @xcite , with an excellent correlation between the @xmath2-ray and near - infrared / optical variations @xcite .",
    "models proposed to explain the observed variability and spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of 3c  454.3 across the electromagnetic spectrum involve processes originating in the radio jet of the quasar .",
    "@xcite suggest that the very high optical flux in spring 2005 was connected with a disturbance ( e.g. , a shock ) propagating along a curved trajectory in the jet , with optical synchrotron photons emitted over a different volume than the longer - wavelength radiation . as the emission zone of a given wavelength passes closest to the line of sight , the flux peaks at that wavelength .",
    "this occurs first at optical and later at longer wavelengths .",
    "@xcite have found that the behavior of 3c  454.3 in 2005 - 2007 is consistent with the model suggested by @xcite , in which the dissipation site of an outburst depends on the bulk lorentz factor and compactness of the perturbation propagating down the jet .",
    "outbursts occurring closer to the black hole ( bh ) should have a more compact emitting region with a lower bulk lorentz factor , @xmath5 , and a stronger magnetic field , @xmath6 .",
    "greater compactness of the emission region intensifies the synchrotron flux as well as the high energy component produced via the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) mechanism , while the external compton ( ec ) high - energy component ( inverse compton radiation with seed photons from outside the jet ) is suppressed owing to a weaker doppler factor , @xmath7 , resulting from the lower value of @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite model the outburst in 2005 as an event that occurred closer to the bh ( @xmath88 , @xmath913 , @xmath1015  g , and size of the emitting region @xmath115.5@xmath1210@xmath13  pc ) than the outburst in 2007 ( @xmath816 , @xmath916 , @xmath109  g , and @xmath118@xmath1210@xmath13  pc ) .",
    "@xcite argue that the optical , x - ray , and millimeter light curves during the outburst in 2005 require a release of a significant fraction of the jet energy when the jet becomes transparent at millimeter wavelengths at the millimeter - wave `` photosphere . ''",
    "these authors conclude that this photosphere is located at @xmath410  pc from the bh , coinciding with the expected location of a torus of hot dust .",
    "@xcite infer that the x - ray and @xmath2-ray emission is most likely produced via the ec mechanism , with seed photons emitted by the hot dust scattered by relativistic electrons in a plasma with bulk lorentz factor @xmath820 .",
    "interpretations of @xmath2-ray observations with _ agile _ during autumn 2007 and the densely sampled light curve provided by the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope starting in 2008 august , combined with simultaneous observations at longer wavelengths , involve higher - energy electrons that emit synchrotron radiation at near - ir and optical wavelengths as well as scatter external photons from the broad line region to energies up to @xmath4100  gev @xcite .",
    "@xcite monitored the quasar 3c  454.3 at 43  ghz with the very long baseline array ( vlba ) bimonthly from march 1998 to april 2001 , and determined parameters of the parsec - scale jet during this period based on the apparent speed of superluminal knots ( also referred to as `` components '' of the jet ) and time scale of their flux variability .",
    "they found that the jet of 3c  454.3 during this time span had physical parameters as follows : @xmath5=15.6@xmath142.2 , @xmath15=1.3@xmath161.2@xmath17 , @xmath7=24.6@xmath144.5 , and @xmath18=0.8@xmath160.2@xmath17 , where @xmath15 is the viewing angle and @xmath18 is the opening half - angle of the jet .",
    "the boston university group resumed vlba monitoring of the quasar in june 2005 , and has continued to monitor the source within a program of roughly monthly vlba imaging of bright @xmath2-ray blazars at 43 ghz . in this paper , we analyze disturbances seen in the quasar jet during the period of high optical activity in 2005 - 2008 , and connect events in the jet with prominent variability at different wavebands .",
    "observations cover the range of frequencies from 10@xmath19  ghz to 10@xmath20  ghz , which provide significantly different angular resolutions at which an event is observed - 10 - 15  arcminutes at high energy frequencies , @xmath45  arcseconds at millimeter and sub - millimeter wavelengths , @xmath41  arcsecond in the optical and ir bands , and @xmath40.1  milliarcsecond ( mas ) with the vlba at 43  ghz .",
    "this renders interpretation of multifrequency behavior challenging , and makes analysis of variability at different wavelengths along with vlbi images the main tool for understanding processes and mechanisms involved in the physics of blazars .",
    "we have analyzed light curves of the quasar 3c  454.3 from @xmath2-ray to radio wavelengths during the period 2004 - 2009 .",

    "figure  [ vlbayr ] presents a sequence of total intensity images , with several images per year convolved with the same beam and with contours based on the same global map peak .",
    "we performed the data reduction in the manner of @xcite using the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) and difmap @xcite .",
    "in addition to the standard resolution beam of uniform weighting of the _ uv_-data , we have convolved the images with a beam of fwhm diameter of 0.1  mas comparable to the resolution of the longest baselines of the vlba .",

    "although the synthesized beam of the vlba observations along the jet is @xmath40.1  mas , we have convolved the core region of the jet with a circular beam with a fwhm diameter of 0.05  mas for epochs when all antennas were in operation and the weather was favorable .",
    "since this is only 30% smaller than the fwhm angular resolution of the longest baseline , 0.07  mas , the array partially resolves structures on 0.05  mas scales . at the majority of suitable epochs ,",

    "such a structure is especially apparent when the core is not disturbed by passage of a moving knot ( _ bottom panel _ ) . to support the conclusion that this fine structure in the core is real , we have constructed similar super - resolved images of the quasar cta102 , obtained with the vlba along with 3c  454.3 .",

    "the resulting images of cta102 contain only single - component cores .",
    "this suggests that the fine structure of the core of 3c  454.3 is not an artifact of the smaller beam .",
    "since vlba data yield only the relative orientation of the electric vector position angle ( evpa ) across a source , special attention was paid to the calibration of the absolute evpa values .",

    "although the estimate of @xmath55 has a large uncertainty and is not simultaneous with the vlba observations reported in this paper , we find that applying the @xmath55 correction at 43  ghz improves the similarity between the behavior of evpas at 86  ghz and 43  ghz .",

    "figure  [ trajks ] shows light curves and trajectories of components .",

    "the brightest knot , @xmath51 , fades dramatically while it is still very close to the core .",
    "since we are interested mainly in the time of ejection of the components and their speed in the vicinity of the core , we have used only those epochs when the components moved ballistically ( the first 10 and 8 epochs for @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively , and all 11 epochs for @xmath51 ) for deriving kinematic parameters .",
    "the parameters and their uncertainties were obtained in the manner described in @xcite .",

    "a delay between the peaks of associated optical and 230  ghz outbursts can be caused by the difference in time when the maximum number of relativistic electrons radiating at optical and mm - waves was achieved : the time of the maximum number of relativistic electrons accelerated to optical - emitting energies coincides with the ejection time , while acceleration of electrons to mm - wave - emitting energies continues for 20 - 30  days longer .",

    "the rotations have similar rates for events @xmath49 and @xmath50 , @xmath156=8.7@xmath141.1 and @xmath157=7.7@xmath140.8 degrees per day , while the rotation during the ejection of @xmath51 is slower , @xmath158=5.2@xmath140.7 degrees per day .",
    "we interpret this as evidence that the rotation of @xmath151 originates in the acceleration and collimation zone ( acz ) .",
    "we can rule out a stochastic rotation of the position angle due to plasma turbulence @xcite , given that all three events have the same sense of rotation and coincide with optical flares . in the acz , poynting flux is converted to bulk kinetic energy through the lorentz force , which rotates the mhd outflows and forms helical trajectories of disturbances propagating down the jet @xcite .",
    "the lorentz factor should increase linearly with cross - sectional radius @xmath159 , while the speed of rotation should decrease as @xmath160 to conserve angular momentum @xcite .",
    "if the polarized optical emission is produced in the acz by an emission feature that follows streamlines that execute a spiral path about the axis , then the speed of rotation of different disturbances should be inversely proportional to the final bulk lorentz factor .",
    "the jet flow must travel farther from the bh to attain a higher lorentz factor , hence the size scales of the site of evpa rotation should be larger and the position of the core should shift downstream relative to states with a lower terminal lorentz factor . in support of these predictions ,",

    "furthermore , there is a discontinuity in the motion of knot @xmath50 near the time of ejection of @xmath51 ( see fig .",
    "[ evol7 ] ) , which could be explained if the 43  ghz core shifted downstream at this time . at the end of the optical evpa rotation in events @xmath50 and @xmath51 ,",
    "the evpa became chaotic , with average value perpendicular to the jet ( see fig .",

    "there are several other properties of such rotations that are similar in bl  lac , 3c  279 , pks  1510@xmath82089 , and 3c  454.3 : ( i ) at the beginning of the rotation , the degree of polarization is low ( @xmath41 - 2% ) ; ( ii ) maximum fractional polarization is achieved when the e - vector aligns with the jet direction ( for event @xmath49 , @xmath163=22% , @xmath164=@xmath8277@xmath17 ; for @xmath50 , @xmath163=26% , @xmath164=@xmath8287@xmath17 ; event @xmath51 is undersampled ) ; and ( iii ) at the end of the rotation , the degree of polarization decreases . we infer that a rotation of the optical polarization position angle during a prominent optical outburst is a common feature of blazars . in addition , in 3c  279 both the optical and 43  ghz core evpas rotate as a superluminal knot emerges from the core @xcite .",
    "a few measurements of the evpa in the core of 3c  454.3 , simultaneous with optical polarization observations , agree with the optical evpas ( fig .",
    "[ polrot ] ) .",
    "however , the agreement occurs when @xmath151 and @xmath60 are closely aligned with the jet direction ( table  [ o7evpa ] ) , so that it is possible that the core evpa remains near that preferred angle instead of rotating with @xmath151 .    despite agreement between @xmath151 and @xmath60 for a number of essentially simultaneous observations ( see table  [ o7evpa ] ) ,",
    "the majority of the high optical polarization measurements occur when the optical evpa is perpendicular to the jet , while at 86  ghz and in the 43  ghz core , the majority of the e - vectors at high degrees of polarization lie along the jet direction .",
    "there are multiple possible reasons for this discrepancy : ( i ) high mm - wave polarization does not exeed 7% , while the optical degree of polarization @xmath16520% quite often ; this is qualitatively consistent with the mm - wave polarization being affected by synchrotron self - absorption , which lowers the degree of polarization and rotates the evpa by 90@xmath17 ; ( ii ) the magnetic field in the core region has a helical structure , with the optical and mm - wave emission regions located in different parts of the helix ; and ( iii ) the jet has a spine - and - sheath structure such that , in a quiescent state , the optical polarization comes from a transition zone between the fast spine stream and slower sheath flow ( such emission would be highly polarized perpendicular to the outflow ; @xcite ) , while the mm - wave emission region is dominated by turbulence and has low polarization . in an active state",
    ", a disturbance in the jet defines the optical and mm - wave polarization properties : at millimeter wavelengths the disturbance orders the magnetic field perpendicular to the jet flow , while @xmath151 depends on whether the disturbance or shear layer dominates the polarized flux .",
    "we have found a connection between mm - wave and optical outbursts and disturbances propagating down the radio jet in 3c  454.3 .",
    "at least three major optical outbursts , @xmath166 , and @xmath99 , observed in 2005 - 2008 are related to superluminal knots identified in the vlba images . @xcite",
    "have found that in blazars the polarization properties of superluminal knots at 43  ghz are consistent with weak shocks and the optical polarized emission originates in shocks , most likely situated between the 86  ghz and 43  ghz vlbi cores .",
    "it appears that shocks and their interaction with underlying jet structure might be generally responsible for optical and high energy outbursts .",
    "comparison of the timing of optical outbursts and epochs of ejection of superluminal knots from the core can be used to determine the location of the sites where kinetic and internal energy is dissipated in the form of radiation . the delay between the peak of an outburst and the time of the ejection of the associated superluminal component ,",
    "along with the apparent speed of the knot , determines the location of the optical outburst in the jet with respect to the core , @xmath167 . according to tables  [ kparm ] and [ delparm ] ,",
    "the peaks of outbursts @xmath168 , and @xmath101 occurred 12.6@xmath145.6  pc upstream , 3.5@xmath143.7  pc downstream , and 2@xmath1418  pc upstream of the core , respectively .",
    "the average location for @xmath100 and @xmath101 is 2.8@xmath143.4  pc downtream of the core . in the case of a conical structure of the jet ,",
    "@xcite have estimated the half opening angle of the jet in 3c  454.3 to be @xmath169 .",

    "therefore , if the perturbation that created @xmath49 is reponsible for @xmath97 , then the maximum of the outburst took place when @xmath49 was located at a distance 5.4@xmath145.2  pc from the central engine , while the maxima of @xmath100 and @xmath101 outbursts occurred at a larger distance from the bh , 21@xmath144  pc , perhaps when knots @xmath50 and @xmath51 passed through the mm - wave core .",
    "this implies that the dissipation site for @xmath102 was closer to the central engine ( bh ) than that for outbursts @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "these results are consistent with the recently advanced ideas that the dissipation sites of optical and high energy outbursts can occur at different locations and involve different sources of seed photons @xcite .",
    "the most powerful optical outburst , @xmath97 , preceded the passage of @xmath49 through the 43  ghz core ( ejection ) by @xmath450  days .",

    "the average of the rise and decay times for @xmath102 has a width of @xmath447  days ( table  [ outparm ] ) , with a rise time of 68  days and a decay of only 26  days .",
    "outbursts @xmath98 and @xmath99 , as well as the flares connected with the passage of @xmath49 through the core , have much shorter durations and similar rise and decay times ( see fig .  [ multi ] ) .",
    "a possible interpretation is that , in the case of @xmath102 , located deeply within the acz , the energization of relativistic electrons is gradual and continuous , while for outbursts occurring in the vlbi core , relativistic electrons are energized abruptly owing to interaction between the disturbance and the core .",
    "the latter implies that the three - flare structure of optical outbursts seen in figure  [ multi ] is related to the physical structure of the mm - wave core .",
    "indeed , the super - resolved images of 3c  454.3 ( fig .",

    ", the presence of multiple standing shocks in three dimensions requires a high level of azimuthal symmetry of the pressure at the boundary of the jet in order for the structure to remain intact .",
    "we have derived the locations of 230  ghz outbursts @xmath184 , @xmath185 , and @xmath186 in the same manner as for optical outbursts @xmath102 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 owing their association with superluminal knots .",

    "this implies that the passage of a disturbance through the 230  ghz core should occur during the rising branch of a mm - wave outburst .",
    "the sharp mm - wave outbursts @xmath117 and @xmath118 ( see fig .

    "in addition , table [ outparm ] shows that the timescale of @xmath117 is @xmath44 - 5 times shorter than @xmath187 of @xmath118 , consistent with @xmath49 moving closer to the jet axis ( a smaller radius of curvature ) and @xmath51 moving along periphery of the jet ( a larger radius of curvature ) , which agrees with the viewing angles of the knots ( table [ kparm ] ) .",
    "we use the delay between the times of ejection of @xmath49 and peak of @xmath117 , along with the kinematic parameters of @xmath49 , to derive the location of the curvature of the jet , which is 54@xmath1416  pc downstream the core .",
    "the analysis of spectral characteristics of outbursts in 3c  454.3 reveals that neither during outbursts nor in quiescent states is the x - ray emission a continuation of the optical synchrotron spectrum .",

    "we have suggested that the optical flares observed within 1@xmath38 uncertainty of the time of ejection of @xmath49 ( fig .",

    "we propose that seed photons for the @xmath2-ray production are local to the mm - vlbi core , arising from a slower sheath surrounding the spine , although synchrotron radiation from the disturbance itself plus the mm - wave core should contribute to the production of @xmath2-rays as well @xcite .",

    "although this may seem a reasonable explanation for the observed strong correlation between @xmath2-ray and optical variations , polarization observations ( see fig .",

    "for this reason , we favor the alternative scenario , wherein the @xmath2-rays are produced by scattering of synchrotron seed photons from the sheath of the jet",
    ".    we can be more specific regarding the nature of the seed photons by considering the steepening of the @xmath2-ray spectrum above 2  gev reported by @xcite , from a spectral index of 1.3 to 2.5 , along with steepening of the spectral index of synchrotron emission from 1.4 at near - ir to 2.3 at soft uv wavelengths ( table [ specind ] ) .",
    "we can explain the steepening of the @xmath2-ray spectrum , as well as the rapid fall - off in the synchrotron emission toward higher ultraviolet frequencies by a steepening of the electron energy distribution above an energy @xmath195 in rest - mass units , where we assume a magnetic field strength @xmath196 g. recent theoretical calculations by @xcite show that , for an inhomogeneous source , more pronounced steepening than by 0.5 in the source s integrated spectral index is possible due to a combination of synchrotron losses and geometrical effects .",
    "if the 2  gev @xmath2-rays are produced by the ec process , the seed photons should have observed frequencies near @xmath197 hz .",

    "<S> we analyze the behavior of the parsec - scale jet of the quasar 3c  454.3 during pronounced flaring activity in 2005 - 2008 . </S>",
    "<S> three major disturbances propagated down the jet along different trajectories with lorentz factors @xmath010 . </S>",
    "<S> the disturbances show a clear connection with millimeter - wave outbursts , in 2005 may / june , 2007 july , and 2007 december . </S>",
    "<S> high - amplitude optical events in the @xmath1-band light curve precede peaks of the millimeter - wave outbursts by 15 - 50  days . </S>",
    "<S> each optical outburst is accompanied by an increase in x - ray activity . </S>",
    "<S> we associate the optical outbursts with propagation of the superluminal knots and derive the location of sites of energy dissipation in the form of radiation . </S>",
    "<S> the most prominent and long - lasting of these , in 2005 may , occurred closer to the black hole , while the outbursts with a shorter duration in 2005 autumn and in 2007 might be connected with the passage of a disturbance through the millimeter - wave core of the jet . </S>",
    "<S> the optical outbursts , which coincide with the passage of superluminal radio knots through the core , are accompanied by systematic rotation of the position angle of optical linear polarization . </S>",
    "<S> such rotation appears to be a common feature during the early stages of flares in blazars . </S>",
    "<S> we find correlations between optical variations and those at x - ray and @xmath2-ray energies . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the emergence of a superluminal knot from the core yields a series of optical and high - energy outbursts , and that the mm - wave core lies at the end of the jet s acceleration and collimation zone . </S>",
    "<S> we infer that the x - ray emission is produced via inverse compton scattering by relativistic electrons of photons both from within the jet ( synchrotron self - compton ) and external to the jet ( external compton , or ec ) ; which one dominates depends on the physical parameters of the jet . a broken power - law model of the @xmath2-ray spectrum reflects a steepening of the synchrotron emission spectrum from near - ir to soft uv wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that the @xmath2-ray emission is dominated by the ec mechanism , with the sheath of the jet supplying seed photons for @xmath2-ray events that occur near the mm - wave core . </S>"
