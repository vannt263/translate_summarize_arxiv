    "neutron stars are among the most interesting celestial objects since their description requires both general relativity and nuclear physics .",
    "the state of matter in the core of nss is not accessible to any terrestrial experiments , and thus provides a unique laboratory to test theoretical predictions for matter at high densities and relatively low temperatures ( compared to particle collisions producing comparable energy densities ) . in particular , there exist many different models predicting the eos of ns matter , see @xcite , among others .",
    "a possibility to constrain those models from ns observations is given by the fact that general relativity predicts a maximum mass for non - rotating and uniformly rotating nss , which depends on the eos .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite discovered nss with masses as high as @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "this already ruled out several eoss , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : m - r ] . a simultaneous observation of mass and radius of a slowly rotating",
    "ns would serve the same purpose .",
    "given a set of observed quantities , constraining the eos obviously requires relations which do depend strongly on the eos .",
    "on the other hand , relations which do _ not _ depend on the eos ( or only weakly ) , are highly useful as well , since they would allow to constrain further unknown parameters without knowledge of the eos .",
    "such universal relations have already been established in the context of binary ns evolution between moment of inertia , the tidal deformability ( love number ) and the quadrupole moment , both for regular nss and quark stars , see @xcite . weakly eos dependent relations between compactness and normalized moment of inertia have been found by @xcite .",
    "other studies @xcite have investigated various empirical universal expressions for oscillation frequencies and damping timescales . among the various types of oscillation modes , the main focus has been on modes for which pressure is the restoring force , in particular the fundamental modes ( @xmath0 modes ) .",
    "knowledge of the @xmath0 modes of nonrotating stars also provides estimates for the @xmath0-mode properties of slowly rotating stars , for the case of uniform rotation @xcite and also for differential rotation @xcite .",
    "some years ago , andersson and kokkotas @xcite proposed an empirical relation for the @xmath0-mode oscillation frequency @xmath3 , based on newtonian theory of stellar perturbations .",
    "they observed that in full gr , @xmath3 depends almost linearly on the square root of the average density . another relation , based on estimates using the quadrupole formula ,",
    "was established for the damping time due to gravitational wave emission , @xmath4 .",
    "later , benhar _ et al . _",
    "@xcite presented further results that included more and newer equations of state , updating the fits from @xcite . the average frequencies @xmath3 were systematically lower than the one for the old eos sample , which they attributed to the fact that the new sample included stiffer eoss .",
    "this highlights an important point : all the universal relations are not truly eos - independent , but restrain parameters in a relatively narrow band which depends on the eoss taken into account . using this band to interpret observational data implicitly assumes that the true eos is similar to one of the eoss considered .",
    "it is therefore important to include a large range of eoss in the sample , to prevent underestimating the residual uncertainties due to the eos .",
    "for this reason , we do not exclude eoss already ruled out by the observation @xcite .",
    "more recently , lau _ et al . _",
    "@xcite improved on the results from @xcite by using quadratic fits for both @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "further , they use the `` effective compactness '' @xmath5 as independent variable , where @xmath6 is the moment of inertia .",
    "in contrast to measures involving the surface radius , @xmath7 is determined by the bulk properties of the ns . note the moment of inertia",
    "could be constrained for isolated stars by observations of spindown and energy output due to magnetic braking , see @xcite .",
    "it might also be measured from high precision observations of spin - orbit couplings in a binary pulsar system , see @xcite .",
    "observing oscillations of isolated nss might in principle be possible through conventional astronomy if they are equipped with a magnetic field . the direct production of electromagnetic emissions due to ns ( and bh )",
    "perturbations was investigated in @xcite .",
    "stellar oscillations might also modulate em emissions produced by other processes .",
    "for example , possible signatures of ns oscillations have already been observed in the luminosity curves of magnetar giant flares @xcite .",
    "however , the low frequencies rule out fundamental modes as the cause .",
    "instead , the modulation was attributed to oscillations of the magnetar crust and magnetic field , see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "another observational channel is given by the gravitational waves emitted by oscillating nss , which have been the subject of many studies over the years ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the detection range is however limited by the fact that oscillations above a certain amplitude are strongly damped by nonlinear effects @xcite . moreover ,",
    "possible excitation mechanisms most likely already saturate at much lower amplitudes .",
    "the most famous mechanism is the cfs instability @xcite , which is restricted to rapidly rotating nss ( for the case of @xmath0 modes ) , and probably suppressed by superfluid or viscous effects outside the instability window described in @xcite .",
    "more speculative excitation mechanisms are phase transitions of the eos @xcite , or resonant excitation in eccentric binaries , proposed by @xcite ( although it seems questionable whether the binary stays in the resonant window sufficiently long ) .",
    "the most promising source of detectable gw from nss is given by the hyper- or supramassive neutron stars which can be formed in binary ns mergers @xcite .",
    "however , those are rapidly and differentially rotating .",
    "further , they are hot and not in @xmath8-equilibrium , and thus do not follow a simple barotropic eos . due to these additional degrees of freedom ,",
    "universal relations found for slowly rotating cold stars are not directly applicable .",
    "still , a better understanding of the simple nonrotating case is certainly beneficial for the development of more sophisticated models needed to describe hypermassive nss .",
    "our first aim in this paper is to provide accurate results for the @xmath0 modes in a wide range of masses and the eoss given in table  [ tableeos ] , which we hope will be useful for the community . in spite of being widely used in this field , properties of the @xmath0 modes are not available in the literature for some of the eoss .",
    ".the equations of state used in this paper .",
    "all of the eos , except for the last two , are distributed with the publicly available lorene code @xcite .",
    "the ls220 and sht eoss include temperature and composition dependency ; we use the barotropic eoss obtained by imposing zero - temperature and @xmath8-equilibrium .
