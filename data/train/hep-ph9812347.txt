    "heavy quark spectroscopy is a very interesting and rewarding subject for study .",
    "the discovery of charmonium definitely swept away all doubts the physics community had about the existence of quarks as the fundamental building blocks of hadrons .",
    "mesons with one heavy and one light quark is a further excellent laboratory to test our ideas about strong interactions .",
    "these mesons are in a way the hydrogen atoms of quark physics .",
    "as the mass of the heavy quark increases , its motion become gradually less and less important and the physical properties of the heavy - light , @xmath4 , meson are more and more determined by the dynamics of the light quark .",
    "the discovery of the heavy quark symmetries by isgur and wise @xcite and the creation of a heavy quark effective theory from qcd@xcite has been extremely important for the analysis of the physics of heavy hadrons @xcite    ideally one would like to compute the couplings in the baryon and meson lagrangian from qcd - in time this should be provided by lattice qcd calculations . in the meantime model calculations can be useful and one might hope that these give us some physical insight for the long distance behavior of the quark interaction .",
    "there are many models used in quark physics and we have chosen a variant of the m.i.t . bag model that was created by w. wilcox , o. v. maxwell and k. a. milton @xcite ( wwm ) , at a time when there were little information about exited systems made of one heavy and one light quark .",
    "the model is a nice theoretical laboratory , it lends itself to analytical calculations and it seems to give results that are not too far from experimental results . in particular",
    "it seems to work well for calculations of the isgur - wise function @xcite and to represents an improvement over results coming from the m.i.t .",
    "bag model @xcite . in the wmm - model",
    "the heavy quark is placed in the center of the bag and the light quark moves in the colour electromagnetic field set up by the heavy quark .",
    "the hamiltonian for the light quark is then @xmath5 @xmath6 are the generators of the @xmath7 colour group .",
    "the index @xmath8 refers to the light(heavy ) quark .",
    "we have used @xmath9 and the usual notation @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where the @xmath12 s are the dirac matrices and @xmath13 the gellman matrices . @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the colour electric potentials and vector fields respectively produced by the heavy quark .    as",
    "gluon selfcouplings are neglected and the heavy quark is treated as point like the potential has a coulomb like form : @xmath16 substituting this potential into equation ( [ eq : uph ] ) give us : @xmath17 using the constraint that the meson is a colour singlet , that is @xmath18 the equation of motion of the light quark in the meson rest frame is then simply @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "the four component wave function @xmath21 of the light quark ( ignoring @xmath22 ) is therefore the well known solutions for the relativistic coulomb problem .",
    "we shall use the notation @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the two component spinors describing the angular part of the wavefunction .",
    "the energy of the confined light quark is determined by the bogolioubov - mit boundary condition @xcite which in the rest frame of the meson takes the form @xmath25 .",
    "substituting equation ( [ eq : wavefl ] ) into this equation and using the following property @xmath26 give us : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the radius of the spherical bag .",
    "the confinement of the light quark presumably originating from the gluonic selfcouplings is now taken care of by equation ( [ eq : bound ] ) and the surface conditions : @xmath29    the vector fields @xmath30 that are set up by the heavy quark and fulfill the boundary conditions ( [ eq : boundb1 ] ) are @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the colour magnetic moment(s ) of the heavy quark : @xmath33 @xmath34 is the mass of the heavy quark and @xmath35 its spin operator .",
    "@xmath22 now takes the form : @xmath36 the contribution of @xmath22 to the energy is calculated perturbatively and the hyperfine splitting energy to first order in @xmath37 is @xmath38 @xmath39 is the normalization of the wavefunction , @xmath40 . here",
    "@xmath41 is the total angular momentum of the mesonic system and @xmath42 is the light quark ( total ) angular momentum . from equation ( [ eq : i ] )",
    "we see for @xmath43 then @xmath44 ; this is the heavy quark limit .",
    "the mass functional for a heavy meson described in our bag model will be : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the energy needed to create a bag in vacuum , @xmath47 is the zero point energy proportional to @xmath48 , @xmath49 is the heavy quark mass and @xmath50 is the light quark energy @xmath51 , where @xmath52is the hyperfine splitting energy to first order given in equation ( [ eq : i ] ) .",
    "we will say more about the first two terms later .",
    "for now we only note that if the radii of two mesons with same flavour of the heavy quark is kept constant , then the mass difference between them are given by the following formula : @xmath53 this means that if the radii of two mesons do not differ too much , then the difference between the energy levels is directly related to the mass difference of the two mesons .",
    "it is of interest first to see how the energy levels of the meson are ordered in the heavy quark limit when the colour electric central potential increases , these are shown in fig . [",
    "fig : enlev4 ] .",
    "as we can see an increase in the central field from the special case where the light quark moves freely in the bag , reduces the mass of the @xmath54 states - and even make them cross .",
    "the odd parity states stay however roughly half way between the ground state and the first excited @xmath55-state .",
    "this will lead to some difficulties when we try to fit the spectrum of heavy meson states .",
    "the breaking of the heavy quark limit is given by the spin - spin interaction and in our model by the term @xmath52 , given in equation ( [ eq : i ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that this term is dependent of both @xmath56 and @xmath37 which determines the strength of the central four vector potential the light quark moves in . in this",
    "respect our model is more constraining than most models where the interquark central potential is unrelated to the strength of the spin - spin and spin - orbit interaction .    in figure [ fig : enhq ]",
    "we have plotted the energy levels for the light quark in the case where @xmath57 for constant @xmath28 . in this graph",
    "we have also plotted the heavy quark limit , the energy level above the heavy quark limit is for each pair of states where the spin of the light quark and the heavy quark couples to @xmath58 and the level below for the case where the spins couples to @xmath59 .",
    "we see that for a given heavy quark multiplet , the induced splitting of the formerly degenerate states with the same angular momentum @xmath42 of the light quark , but with different angular momentum @xmath41 for the meson , is a highly nonlinear function of @xmath37 . only for @xmath37 smaller than @xmath60",
    "can the hyperfine splitting with a reasonable approximation be taken as a linear function of @xmath37 as it is in the nonrelativistic quark model treatment .    from figure",
    "[ fig : enhq ] we also note that the hyperfine splitting ( for finite @xmath61 ) increases as we go up in light quark excitations .",
    "this is quite opposite from the situation in the hydrogen atom and is a reflection of the bag models abrupt confinement .    for the charm sector",
    "only for the two lowest states it is reasonable to calculate the hyperfine splitting perturbatively , this is because of the much smaller mass of the @xmath2-quark .",
    "in the previous section we looked at the qualitatively features of the spectra of the heavy mesons .",
    "now we will try to reproduce the quantitatively measured masses . in figure [ fig : dmeson ] and [ fig : bmeson ] we have showed the observed spectra of the @xmath62 and @xmath63 mesons .",
    "the mass formula for heavy mesons in our model is : @xmath64    when calculating the coulomb potential in classical electrodynamics it is common to choose @xmath65 inspired by this we adjust the potential inside the bag to be zero at the surface of the bag @xcite : @xmath66 now the value of the potential at the bag surface will be zero , independent of the radii of the different mesons . because of this transformation the light quark gets a contribution @xmath67 to the energy .",
    "this we include in the light quark energy .    the second term , @xmath68 , in equation ( [ eq : massf ] ) is supposed to represent the zero point energy in the bag .",
    "when one quantizes a radiation field there will always be an infinite zero point energy term , but since physical quantities often are energy differences , the zero point energy falls out .",
    "however , when the quantization is carried out in a finite cavity , as in our model , there will be additional pieces of the zero point energy which depends on the size of the cavity .",
    "this is represented by the term @xmath68 .",
    "the constant @xmath69 can be calculated if we believe that the zero point energy give rise to the casimir energy .",
    "the casimir energy inside a perfectly uncharged spherical shell has been calculated by k.a.milton , l.l.deraad , jr . and",
    "j.schwinger in @xcite .",
    "they obtained a value @xmath70 . to find the value in our model we simply have to multiply the value by eight , because there are eight gluonic radiation fields :",
    "we have determined the masses by minimizing the mass functional by the relation : @xmath72 it turns out that the integral in equation ( [ eq : mint ] ) goes as @xmath73 since @xmath74 it is clear that when @xmath75 , @xmath76 will dominate .",
    "if the factor in front of the hyperfine splitting is negative , equation ( [ eq : massf ] ) will for some choice of the parameters have no finite minima .",
    "when the radius become small we can not neglect the repulsion of the heavy quark and the model becomes meaningless .",
    "this is a well known problem and the usual way of dealing with this is to argue that the divergence will disappear when we calculate higher orders correction .",
    "the procedure then is to minimize the energy with respect to @xmath28 _ before _ adding the hyperfine term @xcite . in our model states with same @xmath42 and @xmath77 will then have equal radii .",
    "first of all we have to determine the parameters in the model . there are four parameters the strong coupling constant(@xmath37 ) , the bag constant(@xmath63 ) , the heavy meson mass(@xmath49 ) and the light quark mass(@xmath78 ) .",
    "there are of course many ways of determining the parameters , we have chosen too look at the @xmath63 mesons . we have chosen to determine @xmath79 from the observed masses of the @xmath80 and @xmath81 mesons , and since the @xmath0 and @xmath1 quark have a small mass we have assigned to them a ( rather unimportant ) mass of @xmath82 .",
    "the calculated results are shown in table [ tab : masstab1 ]       it is also possible to calculate the coupling @xmath87 , the @xmath88 emits a virtual pion .",
    "this coupling has been calculated in the rest system of the heavy meson at zero recoil , the result is : @xmath89 the coupling of photons to the mesonic states are done straight forward by using the interaction lagrangian : @xmath90 some expressions for electromagnetic transitions are listed below : @xmath91 where we have defined : @xmath92    the numerical values for the above expressions are shown in table [ tab : ratetab ] . the transitions in table [ tab : ratetab ] are very suppressed in comparison with those listed in table [ tab : ratetab2 ] .",
    "this of course is expected , the smaller phase space for pion decays is compensated by the much stronger pion coupling relative to the electromagnetic coupling .      we have calculated a lot of partial widths for different particles , listed in table [ tab : ratetab2 ] and [ tab : ratetab ] . to day",
    "very little is known on the experimental front , but there are a lot of theoretical predictions .",
    "so we will compare our results with the known experimental and some of the theoretical results .",
    "as we shall see there are no conflict between our predictions and the experimental information .",
    "the width of @xmath94 have the same upper limit as the width of @xmath95 .",
    "it may not be clear from table [ tab : teor ] , but the theoretical predictions vary a lot . in @xcite",
    "there is a summary of theoretical estimates . for the particular decay @xmath96 that determines the coupling constant @xmath97 , the predicted rates vary from @xmath98(qcd sum rules ) to more than @xmath99(quark model + chiral hqet ) .",
    "we obtained @xmath100 , close to the value ( @xmath101 ) coming from p.cho and h.georgi @xcite who makes calculations with chiral hqet .",
    "the value of the coupling @xmath102 vary from @xmath103(qcd sum rules ) to @xmath104(quark model+chiral hqet ) , we found @xmath105 .",
    "we have calculated most but not all decay modes for the excited states .",
    "the @xmath106 modes are missing . as we believe that these modes are less important than the emission of single pions in the decays we still can give approximate values of the decay widths , these are : @xmath107    the @xmath108 states are naturally much wider than the @xmath109 states because they decay only trough an @xmath55-wave , whereas the @xmath109 states decay through a @xmath62-wave .",
    "the full width of the @xmath54 states indicated by a preliminary experiment @xcite are @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "this is , as we see , in good agreement with our results .",
    "since the @xmath108 states are so broad , they are very hard to reconstruct from the experimental results , and so far there have not been any really precise measurement of their masses .    the cleo report @xcite contains best measurement of the @xmath112 branching fractions , a large improvement of what can be found in the particle data book @xcite . since we have calculated the width of the @xmath112 meson , equation ( [ eq : widthd ] ) , it is easy to calculate the branching ratios .",
    "the results are shown in table [ tab : cleo ] together with the cleo results .",
    "our results are clearly in good agreement with the experimental data we recognize however that branching ratios are one thing , particular decay widths another .",
    "we get the correct ratio between pionic and electromagnetic decays . as the coupling of the electromagnetic field to the quarks is simple",
    ", we naturally have some confidence in the calculated electromagnetic transitions rates .",
    "therefore we believe that our calculated pionic rates can not be too far off from what will be measured in the future .    99 nathan isgur and mark b.wise , phys . lett .",
