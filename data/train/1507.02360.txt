    "although the gradient flow in lattice gauge theory is utilized to study non - perturbative dynamics of gauge theory , information available through perturbative theory is always useful because the latter is well under analytic control . in the present paper , aiming at possible simplification in perturbative calculations associated with the gradient flow , we consider the application of the idea of the background field method  @xcite to the gradient flow .",
    "it is well known that this method considerably simplifies perturbative computation of , e.g. , renormalization constants .    as clarified in  ref .",
    "@xcite , for perturbative consideration of the gradient flow , it is useful to introduce a `` gauge - fixing term '' that breaks gauge covariance of the flow equation ; this term gives rise to a gaussian damping factor also for gauge degrees of freedom and ensures a convergence property of momentum integrals .",
    "here , we consider a modified form of the gauge - fixing term in the flow equation that manifestly preserves covariance under the background gauge transformation . it is shown that our gauge - fixing term does not affect gauge - invariant quantities , as the conventional gauge - fixing term .",
    "this formulation thus allows a background gauge covariant perturbative expansion of the flow equation that provides , in particular , a very efficient computational method of expansion coefficients in the small flow time expansion  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  sect .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we present our general formulation .",
    "both flow equations for the gauge field and for the fermion fields are considered .",
    "the most important observation is the independence of gauge - invariant quantities on the gauge - fixing term we introduce ( sect .",
    "[ sec:2.3 ] ) . in subsequent sections ,",
    "we consider applications of the formulation : in  sect .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , we consider the computation of expansion coefficients in the small flow time expansion  @xcite relevant to the construction of the lattice energy  momentum tensor ; this computation was carried out in  ref",

    "it can , however , be shown that  @xcite any gauge - invariant quantity , that does not contain the flow time derivative  @xmath20 , is independent of the `` gauge parameter ''  @xmath21 and physical observables are not affected by the gauge - fixing term .    in the present paper",
