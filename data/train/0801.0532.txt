    "the fact @xcite that the cacti operad introduced in @xcite has an @xmath4 suboperad has been instrumental for the considerations of string topology @xcite . in terms of algebraic actions",
    "this particular @xmath4 operad has been useful in describing actions on the hochschild cochains of an associative algebra @xcite .",
    "all these considerations have some form of physical 1 + 1 dimensional field theoretical inspiration or interpretation , which for a mathematician essentially means that one is dealing with maps of surfaces .",
    "in particular the @xmath4 structure of the little discs and cacti is at home in such a 2dimensional geometry .    in this context",
    ", the natural question arises if the higher order @xmath1 operads can also be realized on surfaces . according to the yoga of string theory",
    ", two dimensional structures should be enough .",
    "in particular one should be able to describe higher dimensional objects , like branes , with strings .",
    "in our setting this translates to the expectation that there should be surface realizations for @xmath1 operads .",
    "the fulfillment of this expectation is exactly what we accomplish .",
    "the novel feature is that these surfaces are of arbitrary genus and not only of genus zero .",
    "now , as soon as one introduces genus into an operadic structure , the genus ceases to be bounded .",
    "this is why we first construct an @xmath0 operad using surfaces with boundaries of all genera .",
    "the way we identify @xmath0 structure is to invoke berger ",
    "fiedorowicz s theory @xcite of @xmath5 and @xmath0 operads .",
    "hence we obtain a filtration of our @xmath0 operad by @xmath5 operads .",
    "this filtration is roughly by genus and it exhibits an interesting periodicity .",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath7 operads are both realized basically by genus @xmath3 surfaces with boundaries .",
    "more precisely , their operadic degree @xmath8 components are realized on a surface of the indicated genus .",
    "the specific difference between the operads @xmath6 and @xmath7 is identified to be the possibility to twist on one particular boundary , namely the `` out boundary '' .",
    "the method we use for the construction is based on the @xmath9 operad , whose formalism we briefly review .",
    "just like for cacti there will be a certain tree condition .",
    "since although arc graphs are for us the most natural language , the language of ribbon graphs is more widely used , we provide an appendix with a dual description in terms of ribbon graphs . if one so wishes using this dictionary one can translate all the results into this purely combinatorial language thereby sacrificing their geometric origin .    in order to produce the operads",
    ", we will have to use a new technique of `` stabilizing '' .",
    "it is clear that some identifications have to be made , since we know from representations or better algebras over the operad @xmath10 that the gerstenhaber bracket does not always vanish and likewise neither does the string bracket . in other words",
    "we should not be able to find a homotopy which `` kills off '' the cell for the bracket in the usual formalism of arcs and moduli spaces @xcite .",
    "in fact , for a frobenius algebra , we know from @xcite that the obstruction to `` kill '' the bracket is the euler element of the algebra . on the geometric level we can force the homotopy , by identifying boundary components of a cellular compactification with cells comprised of lower genus surfaces . this is what our stabilization procedure formalizes . in the algebraic setting",
    "this stabilization is possible in the case that the algebra is semi  simple and has a particularly simple metric .",
    "our constructions can be generalized to the full @xmath9 spaces and will yield a new way to stabilize moduli spaces . in the future",
    ", we also expect to find explicit formulas for the higher dyer  lashof  cohen operations using the new geometric insights from the surface formalism .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the first section , we review the basic setup for the arc operad to make the paper more self contained .",
    "the second section introduces the stabilization for the various tree operads .",
    "the straightforward construction yields operads without a @xmath11term just like cacti . in order to obtain a @xmath11term for the operad we consider a thickening of the construction . without the thickening we can add a @xmath11term , but",
    "then the associativity will hold only up to homotopy . in the third section ,",
    "we show that stabilization and thickening yield a cellular @xmath0 operad in the sense of berger .",
    "there is a filtration on the @xmath0 operad giving rise to a new surface representation for @xmath1 operads . without the @xmath11terms we can omit the thickening step",
    "the fourth section passes to the chain level and gives cellular models as well as operations , such as @xmath12 and the dyer ",
    "cohen operations . for the chain level , as we show , one can omit the thickening procedure as the induced structure of the stabilization is already an operad even if one includes a @xmath11term .",
    "the last section contains applications to string topology and hochschild actions as well as the construction of a new @xmath2 spectrum .",
    "we also discuss the generalizations to the @xmath9 operad and the sullivan prop .",
    "the appendix contains the dual ribbon graph picture .",
    "we wish to thank the organizers of the postinkov memorial conference . this was a wonderful place to share ideas and gain new insights .",
    "we also thank the editors of this volume for encouraging us to stop procrastinating and finally write down these results that had long been announced .",
    "this paper owes its existence to discussions which have been carried on over by now some years with jim mcclure whom it is a pleasure to thank .",
    "we also wish to thank craig westerland for discussions on his work and paolo salvatore for comments .",
    "some of the research was carried out while we were visiting the max  planck  institute in bonn and we gratefully acknowledge its support .",
    "in order to be more self  contained , we begin with reviewing the constructions of the @xmath9 operad of @xcite . ultimately we will specialize to a suboperad in this paper , but the gluing procedure is of course still the same .",
    "furthermore , the more general point of view will allow for some generalizations in the future .",
    "we will follow @xcite for this abbreviated exposition .",
    "the reader familiar with these constructions may skip ahead only consulting  [ subspaces ] for the definition of the new suboperads we will consider .",
    "fix an oriented surface @xmath13 of genus @xmath14 with @xmath15 punctures and @xmath16 boundary components which are labeled from @xmath11 to @xmath17 , together with marked points on the boundary , one for each boundary component .",
    "we call this data @xmath18 for short if no confusion can arise",
    ".    the piece of the @xmath9 operad supported on @xmath18 will be an open subspace of a space @xmath19 .",
    "the latter space is a cw complex whose cells are indexed by graphs on the surface @xmath13 up to the action of the pure mapping class group pmc which is the group of orientation preserving homeomorphisms of @xmath13 modulo homotopies that pointwise fix the set which is the union of the set of the marked points on the boundary and the set of punctures .",
    "a quick review in terms of graphs is as follows .      by an embedding of a graph @xmath20 into a surface @xmath18 ,",
    "we mean an embedding @xmath21 with the conditions    * @xmath20 has at least one edge . * the vertices map bijectively to the marked points on the boundaries . *",
    "no images of two edges are homotopic to each other , by homotopies fixing the endpoints . * no image of an edge is homotopic to a part of the boundary , again by homotopies fixing the endpoints .",
    "two embeddings are equivalent if there is a homotopy of embeddings of the above type from one to the other .",
    "note that such a homotopy is necessarily constant on the vertices .",
    "the images of the edges are called arcs , and the set of connected components of @xmath22 are called complementary regions .",
    "changing representatives in a class yields natural bijections of the sets of arcs and connected components of @xmath23 corresponding to the different representatives .",
    "we can therefore associate to each equivalence class of embeddings its sets of arcs together with their incidence conditions and connected components  strictly speaking of course the equivalence classes of these objects .    by a graph @xmath24 on a surface",
    "we mean a triple @xmath25)$ ] where @xmath26 $ ] is an equivalence class of embeddings of @xmath20 into that surface .",
    "we will denote the isomorphism class of the set of complementary regions by @xmath27 .",
    "we will also set @xmath28 , were @xmath29 is the set of edges of @xmath20 .",
    "fixing the surface @xmath18 , we will call the set of graphs on a surface @xmath30 .",
    "notice that due to the orientation of the surface the graph inherits an induced linear order of all the flags at every vertex @xmath31 from the embedding .",
    "furthermore there is even a linear order on all flags by enumerating the flags first according to the boundary components on which their vertex lies and then according to the linear order at that vertex .",
    "this induces a linear order on all edges by enumerating the edges by the first appearance of a flag of that edge .",
    "the set of such graphs on a fixed surface @xmath18 is a poset .",
    "the partial order is given by calling @xmath32)\\prec ( f,\\gamma,[i])$ ] if @xmath33 is a subgraph of @xmath20 with the same vertices and @xmath34 $ ] is the restriction of @xmath26 $ ] to @xmath33 . in other words ,",
    "the first graph is obtained from the second by deleting some arcs .",
    "we associate a simplex @xmath35)$ ] to each such graph .",
    "@xmath36 is the simplex whose vertices are given by the set of arcs / edges enumerated in their linear order .",
    "the face maps are then given by deleting the respective arcs .",

    "the pure mapping class group naturally acts on @xmath38 and has finite isotropy @xcite .",
    "we let @xmath40 be the quotient space and call its elements arc families",
    ".      given a graph on a surface , we call its pmc orbit its arc graph . if @xmath24 is a graph on a surface , we denote by @xmath42 its arc graph or pmc orbit .",
    "we denote the set of all arc graphs of a fixed surface @xmath18 by @xmath43 .",
    "a graph is called exhaustive if there are no vertices @xmath44 with valence @xmath45 .",
    "this condition is invariant under @xmath46 and hence we can speak about exhaustive arc graphs .",
    "the set of all exhaustive arc graphs on @xmath18 is denoted by @xmath47 .",
    "since the incidence conditions are preserved , we can set @xmath48 where @xmath24 is any representative and likewise define @xmath49 .",
    "we call an arc graph exhaustive if and only if it contains no isolated vertices , that is vertices with @xmath45 .",
    "now by construction it is clear that @xmath19 is realized as a cw complex which has one cell of dimension @xmath50 for each arc graph @xmath42 .",
    "moreover the cell for a given class of graphs is actually a map of a simplex whose vertices correspond to the arcs in the order discussed above .",
    "the attaching maps are given by deleting edges and identifying the resulting face with its image .",
    "due to the action of @xmath46 some of the faces may become identified by these maps , so that the image will not necessarily be a simplex .",
    "the open part of the cell will however be homeomorphic to an open simplex , which can be taken as one of its preimages .",
    "the pmc action acts on the graph and hence acts simplicially .",
    "let @xmath51 be the image of the cell and @xmath52 be its interior , then @xmath53 let @xmath54 denote the standard @xmath55simplex and @xmath56 its interior then @xmath57 which only depends on the underlying graph @xmath20 of @xmath24 .",
    "this also means that the space @xmath19 is filtered by the cells of dimension less than or equal to @xmath3 .",
    "using barycentric coordinates for the open part of the cells the elements of @xmath19 are given by specifying an arc graph together with a map @xmath58 from the edges of the graph @xmath29 to @xmath59 assigning a weight to each edge s.t .",
    "the sum of all weights is @xmath60 .",

    "we call the set of @xmath65 the projective weights of the edges . in the limit ,",
    "when the projective weight of an edge goes to zero , the edge / arc is deleted , see @xcite for more details . for an example , see figure [ f02delta ] , which is discussed below in example [ arcex ] .",

    "up to pmc there is a unique graph with one edge and a unique graph with two edges .",
    "the former gives a zero  cell and the latter gives a one  cell whose source is a 1simplex .",
    "its two subgraphs with one edge that correspond to the boundary lie in the same orbit of the action of pmc and thus are identified to yield @xmath72 .",
    "the fundamental cycle is given by @xmath36 of figure [ f02delta ] .",
    "identifying @xmath72 with @xmath73 we define @xmath74 to be the element corresponding to @xmath75 as depicted in figure [ f02delta ] .",
    "= 4 in      there are several pictures one can use to view elements of @xmath76 . in order to draw elements",
    "it is useful to expand the marked point on the boundary to an interval called window , and let the arcs end on this interval according to the linear order .",
    "equivalently , one can mark one point of the boundary and let the arcs end in their linear order anywhere _ but _ on this point .",
    "we will mostly depict arc graphs in the latter manner .",
    "see figure [ different ] for an example of an arc graph all arcs running to the marked points and its alternate depiction with _",
    "none _ of the arcs hitting the marked point and all arcs having _ disjoint endpoints_.    = 3 in    since in the following we will always be dealing with arc graphs , we will now omit the over - line in the notation .",
    "hence we will write @xmath77 .",
    "we also fix that @xmath78 is the underlying graph .",
    "furthermore elements of @xmath41 will usually be called @xmath79 and @xmath80 . if @xmath81 we fix that @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the underlying arc graph , its underlying graph and the projective metric , respectively .",
    "we define @xmath86 to be the subset of those weighted arc graphs whose arc graph is exhaustive .",
    "we define @xmath87 .      we shall only give a short recap .",

    "the construction does not depend on the choice . with this metric ,",
    "one produces a partially measured foliation in which the arcs are replaced by bands of parallel leaves ( parallel to the original arc ) of width given by the weight of the arc . for this",
    "we choose the window representation and also make the window tight in the sense that there is no space between the bands and between the end - points of the window and the bands . finally , we put in the separatrices .",
    "the normalization we choose is that the sum of the weights at boundary @xmath91 of @xmath92 coincides with the sum of the weights at the boundary @xmath11 , we can also fix them both to be one .",
    "now when gluing the boundaries , we match up the windows , which have the same width , and then just glue the foliations .",
    "this basically means that we glue two leaves of the two foliations if they end on the same point .",
    "we then delete the separatrices .",
    "afterwards , we collect together all parallel leaves into one band . in this procedure ,",
    "some of the original bands might be split or `` cut '' by the separatrices .",
    "we assign to each band one arc with weight given by the width of the consolidated band .",
    "if arcs occur , which do not hit the boundaries , then we simply delete these arcs .",
    "we call these arcs or bands `` closed loops '' and say that `` closed loops appear in the gluing '' .    notice that after gluing there will be no parallel arcs , since all parallel leaves are collected into _",
    "one _ band and the condition of being parallel is pmc invariant before and after gluing .    @xcite together with the gluing operations above , the spaces @xmath9 form a cyclic operad .    another way to see the gluing is in terms of duplicating arcs and gluing the complementary regions .",
    "the duplication occurs when inserting the separatrices or equivalently cutting the bands ; see figure [ gluingex1 ] for an example .",
    "=      we will often be interested in the dual structure to gluing , that of cutting . in order to cut a surface into two components such that their operadic composition is the original surface we have to specify the following data : a separating curve @xmath93 and a point @xmath94 on @xmath93 .",

    "the operad multiplication preserves the cellular structure .",
    "we see that gluing in arc families and then discs everywhere , there are only two situations that can arise . either the two boundaries were in the same family or in two different ones . in both cases",
    "we see that the result of gluing in discs is the same whether we do it before or after gluing . in the first case",
    "this means that we only look at the surface where both boundaries that are the pre - images of @xmath371 lie , and in the second case we look at the surface into which we glue and only keep the boundaries @xmath16 and @xmath15 into which the two surfaces are glued . this is exactly how the composition in @xmath361 was defined .",
    "there is an ordered point in each cell .",
    "these points are given by the iterated gluings @xmath427 and their images under @xmath428 , where @xmath429 is the element in @xmath430 whose weights on the arcs at each of the boundaries are all equal , i.e. @xmath431 + 1}$ ] at the boundary 1 and @xmath432 + 1}$ ] at the boundary 2 .",
    "the claims about @xmath359 as cellular @xmath0 preoperad again follow by contracting @xmath433 to @xmath434 by contracting the gaps .",
    "the cellular @xmath0 operad structure follows from the above argument , since the gaps can be ignored for the filtrations .",
    "the operads @xmath435 are @xmath1 operads and the operad @xmath359 is an @xmath0 operad .",
    "immediate from fiedorowicz s theorem ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.16 ) , which states that cellular @xmath1 operads are @xmath1 operads and cellular @xmath0 operads are @xmath0 operads .",
    "using corollary [ equivcor ] :    the operads @xmath436 are equivalent to @xmath437 where @xmath438 are the little @xmath3 cubes and the operad + @xmath439 is an @xmath0 operad without a @xmath11term .",
    "there are cw models for @xmath145 with the suboperads being sub  cw  models .",
    "moreover the cellular chains are also a model for @xmath330 , so that if we are interested only in the chain level , we can omit the thickening step .",
    "the main point is that even if we include the @xmath11th spaces which makes the topological level only associative up to homotopy , the structures are already operads on the chain level . of course this is true for the homology level _ a priori _ and _ a forteriori_.",
    "these cw  models are well behaved under the stabilization process and hence we obtain a combinatorial graph chain model for @xmath440 and @xmath358 .",

    "the cells are indexed by the quasi  filling arc graphs , while in the latter the graphs also satisfy the conditions of @xmath146 . furthermore adding @xmath11components the analogous statements hold true and the cellular chains of @xmath457 are a model for @xmath358 .",
    "the indexing by quasi  filling graphs is clear in view of corollary [ quasicor ] .",
    "the rest is straightforward using the usual techniques of @xcite .",
    "we wish to point out that the boundary of a cell @xmath459 now consists of those graphs obtained by removing an arc from @xmath24 which is not the only arc incident to a boundary and then stabilizing . for an illustration",

    "moreover this periodicity also manifests itself in the fact that @xmath462 is in the image of @xmath187 and @xmath463 is twisted at zero .",
    "this means that the sequence is : twist at zero , add genus , twist at zero etc ..      in this formalism we can also make the dyer - lashof - cohen operations for double loop spaces explicit . by the general theory ,",
    "see @xcite we need to find particular elements @xmath464 that is homology classes of the little 2cubes with values in the sign representation",
    ".    now taking co - invariants on @xmath465 which is a chain model for the little discs operad @xmath466 we see that the @xmath94the iteration of the product @xmath467 that is the operation given by @xmath468 gives a class that is the sum over all trees of the highest dimension where the partial order on the labeled vertices when considered in the usual tree partial order is compatible with the linear order on @xmath469 .",
    "@xmath470 represents the cohomology class @xmath471 of equation ( [ xieq ] ) in @xmath472 .",
    "this is a tedious but fairly straightforward calculation of the boundary of said combination of cells .",
    "the actual calculation can be adapted from the proof of tourtchine @xcite using cells instead of operations on the hochschild complex .",
    "the dictionary for this is provided by @xcite .",
    "the first example for @xmath473 is given by the operation of @xmath467 which has boundaries in the multiplication and its opposite , cf.figure [ cupi ] , and the example for @xmath474 is the hexagon of figure [ dl3 ] with @xmath475 .",
    "=    we wish to point out several interesting facts .    1 .   the class is solely induced by an operation for @xmath473 .",
    "the resulting cell description is just the left iteration of @xmath467 , whereas the right iteration of @xmath467 is the simple class given by a cube .",
    "when acting on @xmath94 times the same even element , the two iterations coincide .",
    "furthermore the action factors through the coinvariants . when acting on @xmath94 times the same odd element , the action factors through the coinvariants under sign representation .",
    "this is not surprising , but here we have a very geometric picture . + for the actions , we can take the action of the chain operad on itself of the action on the hochschild complex as defined in @xcite . using the former action , we obtain a universal geometric point of view .    using the induced action on the hochschild complex of @xcite , we reproduce the results of westerland @xcite and tourtchine @xcite on representing the dyer  lashof ",
    "cohen operations on the hochschild co  chains .",
    "the _ sequence _ of an element @xmath476 is the sequence @xmath477 , defined by the identification of @xmath478 with @xmath479 provided by @xmath480 and the map @xmath481 which maps each element of the ordered set @xmath478 to the label of its incident boundary that is not the boundary labeled by @xmath11 .    in general for @xmath145 the information @xmath482 does not contain all the information about @xmath79",
    "this is different for @xmath242 .",
    "we already know that both the sequence operad of mcclure and smith @xcite , which we will call @xmath483 , and the operad @xmath242 are @xmath0 operads and hence they are equivalent .",

    "the map @xmath484 induces a surjective morphism of operads @xmath485 .",
    "it maps the cellular filtration above to the filtration by complexity which was introduced in @xcite .",
    "the fact that this is an operadic morphism that is surjective is only an unraveling of the definitions .",
    "also it is straightforward from the definitions that the complexity of the sequence of boundary arcs corresponds exactly to the filtration induced by the @xmath361structure .",
    "probably the operads are even isomorphic , but for our purpose to make the equivalence explicit the result above is sufficient .",
    "let @xmath379 be a commutative frobenius algebra with non  degenerate pairing @xmath486 and unit @xmath60 .",

    "the action of @xmath489 on the hochschild co  chains @xmath490 as defined by restricting the action @xcite passes to @xmath491 if and only if the euler element of @xmath379 is the unit .",
    "we would only like to recall that the action is given by the product over local contributions where in particular there is one such contribution for each complementary region which are of the form @xmath492 , where @xmath288 is the euler element of @xmath379 .",
    "the effect of stabilizing is to set the factor of @xmath493 to @xmath60 , whence the claim .",
    "the condition is met in the case that @xmath379 is semi - simple with a unital metric .",
    "i.e.  there is a basis of idempotents @xmath494 and @xmath495 .",
    "we again wish to make several remarks    1 .   in particular , if @xmath496 with @xmath380 a compact manifold , @xmath379 is semi ",
    "simple only if @xmath380 is a point . in all other cases",
    "the only way would be to formally invert the nilpotent element @xmath288 which yields the zero algebra .",
    "this means that the stabilization is not compatible with string topology , which is good , since otherwise the string bracket would vanish .",
    "2 .   we know",
    "that for fano varieties , which have a system of exceptional sheaves of appropriate length , the quantum cohomology is however semi  simple .",
    "this points to a connection with quantum cohomology .",
    "we expect that the stabilization in our sense is related to the stabilization in the usual sense ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , see below .",
    "in particular this gives a point of contact with witten s @xmath497 function and higher weil  petersson volumes @xcite .",
    "4 .   in order to obtain actions in a wider setting one could try to use a conformal scaling or to alter the differential .      since @xmath359 is an @xmath0 operad it detects infinite loop spaces and so does any operad it is a suboperad of .",
    "furthermore , since it acts on any operad , of which it is a suboperad , the respective operad will yield an @xmath2 spectrum .",
    "the group completions of @xmath498 , @xmath499 and @xmath500 are infinite loop spaces and hence yield @xmath2 spectra .",
    "furthermore all the operads detect infinite loop spaces .",
    "of course @xmath145 is also a suboperad of @xmath9 and of the sullivan prop of @xcite .",
    "it would hence make sense to try and stabilize these two constructions .",
    "for the sullivan prop this is rather straightforward , since we again can choose to stabilize at the out boundaries only .    without going into the full details",
    ", we define the stabilized sullivan quasi  prop to be the colimit over all maps in the system @xmath113 where now we are allowed to glue to any out boundary .",
    "for the @xmath9 operad we have to use a cyclic alternative .",
    "that is as a first approximation we would like to define the stabilization by gluing on the system @xmath113 in all possible ways .",
    "this poses no problem .",
    "but , we will also have to deal with other types of degeneracies , which lead to disconnected graphs ; see the appendix for some more details .    using this more careful analysis",
    "it will be possible to add a neutral element using thickenings .",
    "there is a suitable stabilization @xmath501 of a thickening of @xmath9 whose @xmath11term is the disc and which contains @xmath358 as a suboperad and hence the group completion of @xmath502 is an infinite loop space",
    ".    it will be interesting to figure out which @xmath2 spectrum this is . since stabilization by the element @xmath158 embeds the moduli space @xmath503 as a piece of the boundary of the moduli space @xmath504",
    ", we expect that it will be closely related to the segal  tillmann picture @xcite .",
    "one open question is the full role of the spaces @xmath505 that have been discussed below . in the case of genus",
    "one @xmath204 made the difference between framed little discs and little discs .",
    "similarly , @xmath204 leads to a bi  crossed product @xmath134 .",
    "one could wonder what the inclusion the space @xmath505 signifies .",
    "we can decode some of its structure .",
    "an element @xmath79 of @xmath505 which is untwisted has at most @xmath506 $ ] arcs and this number is realized .",
    "we begin cutting along the arcs .",
    "the maximal number of non  separating cuts is @xmath507 , since the euler characteristic of the underlying surface is @xmath508 and each non  separating cut increases the euler characteristic by @xmath60 .",
    "there are no more non  separating cuts when we are left with a disc of euler characteristic @xmath60 .",
    "this disc will have a boundary made up of a @xmath509gon .",
    "the sides are labeled by sequences where every 4th element is a part of the boundary @xmath11 , every @xmath510 element is a part of the boundary @xmath60 and the @xmath511st and @xmath512rd elements correspond to the cut edges  where each edge appears twice . for @xmath513 , we can insert a maximum of @xmath514=g+[(g-1)/3]$ ] arcs , since each separating arc has to cut off at least an octagon .",
    "this is because each arc has to run from @xmath11 to @xmath60 and these can not be only separated by one edge since otherwise the new arc and the arc represented by the edge would be parallel .",
    "the dimension of the top dimensional cells of @xmath515 , @xmath513 is @xmath516 + 2 $ ] .",
    "for the total count , we can add twists at both ends as soon as @xmath513 . thus keeping in mind that the dimension is one less than the number of arcs , we arrive at the formula above .",
    "thus @xmath145 can not give the framed little discs as the dimension only grows linearly in @xmath14 and not quadratically .",
    "on the other hand the dimensions fit with the dimension of spheres , so that it may look like a marked point on the boundary of the little cubes .    by lemma [ finerlem ]",
    ", however , we see that we get a new decomposition for the @xmath5 operads in terms of @xmath141 respectively @xmath4 and elements of @xmath505 .",
    "notice though that if we decompose @xmath517 we can decompose it as @xmath467 and an element which is not in @xmath518 .",
    "however this element contains exactly one braid .",
    "furthermore , we see that the elements @xmath12 are generated by @xmath467 and particular braid elements of @xmath519}(1)$ ] .    for each @xmath55 there is a suboperad of @xmath520 such that the operad @xmath521 ( an @xmath5 operad without @xmath11term ) is a bi  crossed product of this suboperad and operad @xmath203 ( an @xmath4 operad without @xmath11term ) .",
    "in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) we introduced a dual graph for quasi  filling arc graphs . here we extend this notion to all graphs .",
    "one upshot is that we can make contact with kontsevich s stabilization in this way .",
    "the dual graph of an arc graph @xmath79 is the labeled graph ( semi - stable labeled ribbon graph ) @xmath83 whose vertices are the complementary regions of the arc graph .",
    "we will write @xmath522 for the vertex corresponding to a region @xmath523 .",
    "edges correspond to the arcs of the arc graph and the vertices of an edge to the complementary region(s ) that are bordered by the respective arc .",
    "a flag will be a pair of an arc and a choice of orientation for it or equivalently a side of the arc .",
    "notice that loops are allowed .",
    "since the surface @xmath524 was connected , the graph will be connected .",
    "there is a bit more structure on these graphs , although they generally fall short of being ribbon graphs . to make this discussion more symmetric , we will use one of the equivalent versions for depicting arcs ; see [ picturepar ] .",
    "this is , we move the end ",
    "points of the edges off the marked points on the boundary and move them apart along the orientation of the boundary , so that the arcs are all disjointly embedded , do not hit the endpoints , and their linear order from the marked ribbon graph coincides with the linear order given by counting them off starting at the marked point of a boundary and going around that boundary in its induced orientation . fix a complementary region @xmath523 .",
    "@xmath523 is an oriented surface with boundary .",
    "there are two types of boundary components , those which contain arcs of the original graph and those who do not .",
    "the former are actually @xmath525-gons whose sides alternate between pieces of the boundary and arcs , while the latter consist of a full boundary component of @xmath524 .",
    "let @xmath526 be the number of boundary components of the former type , @xmath527 the boundary components of the latter type and fix @xmath528 to be the genus of @xmath523 after gluing in discs into the boundary .",
    "we set @xmath529 .",
    "now each boundary of @xmath523 containing arcs has an induced orientation , hence we get a cyclic order on these arcs .",
    "formally this means that at each vertex @xmath44 of @xmath83 we have an action of @xmath530 .",
    "each orbit corresponds to a set of flags stemming from one of the boundaries of @xmath523 . in other words",
    "the set of flags @xmath31 is partitioned into subsets @xmath531 and each @xmath532 has a cyclic order .",
    "moreover these cyclic orders fit together to give an action of @xmath533 on the set of all flags @xmath534 , by combining the previous action with the map @xmath535 as usual .",
    "the orbits of this map , which we call @xmath536 are still called cycles of @xmath20 .",
    "although in general the graph can become disconnected this does not happen for @xmath145 .",
    "the reason is that if it were disconnected , then there would be a separating curve which does not cut any of the arcs .",
