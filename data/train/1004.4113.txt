    "quantum gates based on entangled states have in recent times been proposed in several exotic physical systems , e.g.  in ion traps  @xcite and in cold rydberg atoms  @xcite . for a solid state realization , it has been suggested to represent qubits through the electron spin confined in so called quantum dots  @xcite . controlled operations in a network of quantum dots",
    "have subsequently been demonstrated  @xcite , and more recently also achieved in dot molecules  @xcite . a major challenge in such systems is decoherence through interactions with the environment such as hyperfine interaction with the surrounding bath of nuclear spins or coupling to bulk phonon modes  @xcite . in this respect , operations based on laser driven transitions between the involved states  @xcite may have certain advantages as they can be performed much more rapidly then those induced by microwaves@xcite .",
    "quantum dot experiments have now shown that manipulations of single spins as well as state to state electronic transitions are feasible and the technology is continuously improving  @xcite .",
    "progress regarding so called quantum rings has developed in parallel , theoretically  @xcite as well as experimentally  @xcite .",
    "a qualitative understanding of the electronic structure is already well established  @xcite and studies of correlated few ",
    "electron rings have been performed , see e.g.  @xcite .    .",
    "the full blue ( dark gray ) lines correspond to singlets and the dashed red ( light gray ) lines to triplets .",
    "the states used to realize the cnot gate are labeled using the notation @xmath0.[fig1 ] ]    some progress towards quantitative operational quantum gates has been made through suggestions for controlled persistent ring current schemes  @xcite , and numerical demonstrations of fast coherent control in a one - electron quantum ring  @xcite . in the present letter",
    "we have instead analyzed a strongly correlated two - electron quantum ring .",
    "for the design of quantum gates in the time domain , a characterization including both electron - electron interactions and realistic system parameters is a prerequisite , and the understanding of the spectrum of excited states is of utmost importance . with such knowledge , it is possible to design an electromagnetic pulse to optimize transitions , as recently shown in the case of a two - electron quantum dot molecule  @xcite . for this purpose , we perform an exact diagonalization of the two - electron quantum ring hamiltonian with realistic model parameters . from the results ,",
    "we characterize the wave functions in terms of conserved quantum numbers , probability densities and probability currents .",
    "based on this analysis , we propose a new form for quantum information storage and show that a controlled two - bit operation can be performed with almost 100% fidelity .",

    "the lowest energy state for each @xmath45symmetry are all ring formed and the expected properties ; increasing probability currents with increasing @xmath46 and sign dependent direction of the probability current , are clearly shown . moreover ,",
    "both the first and second excited @xmath47 states are ring formed while the third excited state shows a more dot - like behavior with a relatively large probability density at the center of the system .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the relative probability densities and relative probability currents , eq .  ( [ rel_density ] ) and ( [ rel_current ] ) , of the six lowest lying @xmath48 states are shown .",
    "the lowest lying state has one relative current density peak , the first excited state has two peaks etc , up to the third excited state .",
    "these vibrational excitations are expected in a quantum ring  @xcite .",
    "the fourth and fifth excited state , however , do not continue this quantum ring pattern , indicating that these more energetic states are more dot - like . for the relative probability current ,",
    "however , signs of deviation from ring behavior are seen earlier .",
    "while for a large ( or quasi 1d ) ring , the radial component of the relative probability currents would approach ( be ) zero , the currents here show a rich structure . already at the first excited state , and even more clearly in the higher lying states , we see complete departure from this circular shape .",
    "even probability current vortices can be seen , i.e. between the peaks in the third excited state .",
    "hence , we are here in a region of strongly correlated electrons that still exhibit ring - like behavior .",
    "the conservation of the total spin ( @xmath49 ) and angular momentum ( @xmath45 ) suggests the possibility to apply these two variables for storage of quantum information , such that one qubit is represented by @xmath49 and another multivalued ",
    "qumbit \" is stored in @xmath45 .",
    "single qubit operations involving the latter may then be performed by carefully optimized spin conserving electromagnetic interactions @xcite .",
    "controlled spin manipulation will in general be more complicated but can be performed by various schemes involving inhomogeneous magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "the control of the time - scale of the two single - qubit operations will be a matter of magnetic field inhomogeneity vs. size of the quantum ring : experimentally , the degree of inhomogeneity is allowed to increase with the ring - size , thereby decreasing the spin flip period .",
    "the transition period between electronic states , that for small radii are much shorter , will on the other hand increase with the ring radius . at some point , both of these single qubit operations can be performed at comparable time scales .    the critical and remaining question is thus whether two - qubit operations can be performed in such a way that a change of an initial @xmath50 can take place for a conditional value of @xmath49 . the relatively strong electron - electron interaction can here play a constructive role as it changes the electronic energy shift between internal singlet and triplet states , cf .",

    "[ fig4 ] depicts the quotient between @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) as a function of the ring radius @xmath6 .",
    "starting at unity for @xmath53 , this quotient decreases to a minimum at @xmath54 a.u . * and then increases again for larger ring radii . to realize a conditional operation we want this quotient to be as far from unity as possible . however , to protect the cnot against decoherence we want the absolute value of both energy differences to be large .",
    "these energy differences decrease monotonically with the ring radius , see insert of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , yielding better protection for smaller radii . weighting these two things together ,",

    "we solve the time dependent schrdinger equation in the full basis of eigenstates obtained from the previous diagonalization .",
    "the hamiltonian then becomes @xmath80 it is then readily shown that the time dependent schrdinger equation can be written as a coefficient equation including the transition matrix elements from ( the two particle ) state @xmath81 to state @xmath82 @xmath83      fig .",
    "[ fig5]a depicts the time development of the populations of the different states when the pulse central frequency , @xmath60 , corresponds to the energy shift between the two lowest states in the singlet system @xmath84 mev",
    ". the driving laser frequency would then be @xmath85 thz . with the initial state being @xmath86",

    "thus a cnot is realized , as clarified in the truth table of fig .",
    "it clearly depicts how the electromagnetic pulse transfer @xmath88 of the spin singlet population while leaving @xmath89 of the triplet population unchanged .",
    "the natural life time of the excited state is dominated by phonon relaxation and is at least a few orders of magnitudes longer than the time for the induced transition studied here  @xcite . as shown recently ,",
    "the pulse induced transition time may then be decreased by a factor 10 - 100 through quantum optimization field control methods optimized to almost any fidelity  @xcite .",
    "transition times will also be drastically reduced by increased confinement strength which will lead to considerably higher central frequencies , @xmath60 . in the present work , however , we wanted to examine a region of confinement strengths that already is accessible in experiments  @xcite .",
    "the present proposal has certain advantages compared to single quantum dot qubit systems@xcite .",
    "first , the energy difference between the spin states prohibit unwanted transitions up to the order of 10 kelvin . in the quantum molecule qubit ,",
    "the energy differences are typically @xmath90 times smaller@xcite .",
    "furthermore , by taking advantage of a long array of accessible @xmath45 levels , one may develop much more powerful algorithms for certain operations than systems with only two levels .",
    "in conclusion we have shown that quantum controlled operations defining a conditional two - bit transition can be realized in a two - electron quantum ring .",
    "this has been achieved through a detailed analysis of energy levels and properties of the wave functions .",
    "the electron - electron interaction has been utilized to effectively store quantum information simultaneously in the total spin and total angular momentum .",
    "we have shown that with realistic model parameters it is possible to find a regime where the singlet and triplet splittings differ such that an electromagnetic pulse can transfer population of one spin state to a higher energy level , while leaving the population of the other spin state intact .",
    "this opens for a new type of solid state quantum information devices , for which quantum rings are shown to be promising candidates ."
