    "high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) are binary systems , in which a high mass primary star formed the compact star accreting from a secondary massive star .",
    "they are conventionally divided into two subgroups @xcite .",
    "one group usually contains an evolved ( super)giant star , generally @xmath1 , having strong stellar wind or filling its roche lobe ( rl ) to power a bright x - ray source for @xmath2 yr",
    ". the compact star should be either a neutron star ( ns ; @xmath3 ) or a stellar - mass black hole ( bh ; @xmath4 for solar metallicity , but may reach @xmath5 in metal - poor environments , see * ? ? ? * for reviews ) as a result of collapse of high mass primary star .",
    "another possible type of accreting objects may be intermediate - mass ( @xmath6 ) bh ( i.e. , imbhs , see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) , however its exact origin is still not well understood .",
    "the other group is so - called be / x - ray binaries ( be - xrbs ) , in which it contains a be ( b - type star which shows emission - line spectra ) companion , usually accreted by an ns during its periastron passage , showing as x - ray transients .    with chandra s unprecedented sensitivity and angular resolution @xcite",
    ", a large number of hmxbs have been discovered in galaxies even beyond the local group @xcite , allowing to do studies of the collective properties of hmxb populations as a whole .",
    "one of the most striking features of hmxb populations is that the x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) takes a possibly universal form of a single , smooth power law giving an excellent account of hmxbs containing nss , stellar - mass bhs and probably imbhs over the entire x - ray luminosity range @xmath7 .",
    "this is first discovered by @xcite , based on _ chandra _ and _ asca _ data of nearby star - forming galaxies and _ rxte / asm _ , _ asca _ , and _ mir - kvant / ttm _ observations of our galaxy and the magellanic clouds .",
    "they showed that for a wide range of star formation rate ( sfr ) , the hmxb xlf in a galaxy can be well described by a power law with slope of @xmath81.6 , the normalization of which is proportional to the sfr .",
    "they searched for but found no features corresponding to the eddington luminosities of ns and bh in the averaged xlf .",
    "they argued , however , that the expected features may be smeared and diluted by various effects such as distance uncertainties .",
    "with a larger sample of galaxies and better control of systematic effects , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter mgs for short ) revisited this problem and found that the average hmxb xlf is entirely consistent with the one obtained by @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of xlf slope has been improved to @xmath9 , and the values of the high luminosity break at @xmath10 are consistent within statistical uncertainties .",
    "they did not find any statistically significant feature in the xlf near the critical eddington luminosity of nss , either .    although the absence of features in the hmxb xlf is striking and puzzling , theoretical investigations on this remain limited .",
    "using the fundamental mass - luminosity and mass - radius relations for massive stars , as well as a natural assumption on the power - law initial mass function ( imf ; salpeter imf or miller - scalo imf ) and following a semi - empirical approach , @xcite noted that the universal xlf can be readily explained by the universal properties of mass transfer rates in hmxbs .",
    "@xcite , using the `` scenario machine '' code @xcite , instead argued that there should be no universal xlf in both observational and theoretical aspects .",
    "they suggested that the evolution of binaries and their lifetimes in their x - ray stages should be taken into account in future theoretical modelings .",
    "recently , @xcite used a jacobian transformation method to calculate the xlf and the binary - period distribution of hmxbs in the stellar fields of normal galaxies .",
    "their model xlf can match the observed xlf shape quite closely .",
    "they suggested that a future monte carlo evolutionary population synthesis ( eps ) scheme is promising to obtain more detailed understanding of the formation and evolution of hmxb populations .",
    "in fact population synthesis studies on the xlf have already been examined and explored extensively in the past decade .",
    "several authors focused on the xlf modeling for individual galaxies , the types of which cover almost the entire galaxy morphological sequence , for example the star forming galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* i.e. , ngc 1569 ) , star - burst galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ngc 4038/4039 , the antennae ) , and elliptical galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ngc 3379 and ngc 4278 ) .",
    "specifically @xcite modeled the xlf for hmxbs and be - xrbs in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) .",
    "@xcite studied the xlfs of xrb populations in ngc 1291 , in both the bulge and ring regions .",
    "additionally @xcite calculated the numbers and birthrates of symbiotic xrbs in the galaxy .",
    "several authors focused on x - ray / xlf evolution or their numbers of a specific type of galaxies globally , instead .",
    "however most of them are based on semi - empirical , semi - analytical approaches , with simplified assumptions adopted on the formation and evolution of xrbs @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the more sophisticated , state - of - the - art eps simulation has also been explored in this direction .",
    "the first attempt was done recently by @xcite on the cosmic x - ray evolution of xrbs in late - type galaxies , and its dependence on the physical properties of galaxies ( e.g. , optical luminosity , stellar mass , and mass - to - light ratio ) , which is followed by @xcite focusing mainly on the global scaling of emission from xrb populations with star - formation rate and stellar mass , and their evolution with redshifts , by using the millennium - ii simulation as initial conditions . as a series of works following @xcite ,",
    "another two eps studies are presented recently .",
    "one is by @xcite studying on the redshift evolution of the normal galaxy xlf as well as integrated xrb emission from entire galaxies , the other is by @xcite focusing on modeling the xlfs in galaxies in the spitzer infrared nearby galaxy survey ( sings ) .    in the present work",
    ", we use a most up - to - date eps code to model the observed xlf ( both the shape and the absolute source number ) of hmxbs in star - forming galaxies .",
    "we also evaluate the effects of several input parameters such as the imf of binary stars , the natal kick distribution , common envelop ( ce ) efficiency and super - eddington factor ( see sec  2.1 for details ) on the results .",
    "one particular objective of this study is to use the universal featureless xlf to constrain the model parameters .",
    "we also aim to explore the detailed components of hmxb populations , which may help understand the nature of the sources and may be testified by future observations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  2 we describe the population synthesis method and the input physics for x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) in our model .",
    "the calculated results and discussion are presented in  3 .",
    "our conclusions are in  4 .",
    "we calculate the expected numbers for various types of hmxb population using a version of eps code developed by @xcite and updated as described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see appendix a in their paper ) and @xcite . in the present code ,",
    "the compact object masses are calculated in a different way than originally suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we use a prescription the same as ( * ? ? ?",
    "* i.e. , the rapid supernova mechanism ) , which can reproduce successfully the mass gap observed in galactic xrbs when combined with binary evolution @xcite . we also allow for the formation of low mass nss through ecs @xcite . the maximum ns mass is assumed to be @xmath11 , above which bh is assumed to form .",
    "we change the recipes for mass loss of stellar winds by using the metal - dependent fitting formulae given by ( * ? ?",
    "* see also belczynski et al .",
    "the wind velocity is difficult to determine accurately , and usually set to be proportional to the escape velocity from the surface of the mass - losing star , as a ratio @xmath12 .",
    "the values of @xmath12 must depend on the spectral type of the mass - losing star @xcite .",
    "we adopt @xmath13 ( i.e. , slow winds ) for he - rich stars and extended ( @xmath14 ) h - rich giants , @xmath15 for high - mass ( @xmath16 ) main sequence ( ms ) stars , and the default value 0.5 for others .",
    "another two major updates are related to the ce evolution .",
    "one ( and of the most important improvements recently ) is on the ce coefficient , @xmath17 , which describes the binding energy of the envelope .",
    "we now use a more physical estimate of @xmath17 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see below ) rather than the constant value conventionally assumed by most previous studies .",
    "the other is on the updated critical mass ratio criterion for ce initiated by hertzsprung gap ( hg ) donor stars , recently developed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* private communication , see appendix a ) .",
    "the values of other parameters are adopted the same as the default ones in @xcite if not mentioned otherwise .",
    "the hmxbs studied by mgs all reside in nearby star - forming galaxies ( see their table  1 for details ) . due to heterogeneous data of these galaxies ,",
    "the metallicity estimation for each galaxy is still not available , however the rough value is most likely to be around subsolar as a whole ( private communication with mineo s. ) .",
    "so we adopted a fixed subsolar metallicity ( 0.5@xmath18 ) in our basic model .",
    "a lower metal abundance mainly affect stellar wind , making it weaker , so we designed a  weak \" wind model ( i.e.,model m8 ) to test this effect . for star formation",

    "we set up the same grid of initial parameters ( primary mass , secondary mass and orbital separation ) as @xcite did and then evolve each binary . in the following",

    "however we note that in reality this limit may fail for several systems .",
    "one possible example is the recently discovered large population of ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs , non - nuclear point - like sources with isotropic x - ray luminosity exceeding @xmath43 ) , often associated with star - forming regions @xcite .",
    "its luminosity is even higher than the eddington luminosity for a @xmath44 accreting bh .",
    "several different scenarios have been proposed to explain its origin , such as hmxbs powered by stellar mass bhs with anisotropic x - ray emission (  beaming  model , * ? ? ? * ) or with super - eddington accretion rate / luminosity ( due to photon bubble instability , * ? ? ? * ) or with a combination of the two mechanisms @xcite .",

    "the primary fills its rl on its ms , and mass transfer proceeds as it evolves across hg till the end of cheb , at which point ( time 5.1369@xmath102myr ) it is a 12.632@xmath101 naked hems star in a @xmath113 orbit with a 45.730@xmath101 ms companion .",
    "then the hems star evolves across the hehg , and explodes at the time of 5.7680@xmath102myr , leaving a 5.497@xmath101 bh with a 45.327@xmath101 ms companion in an orbit of 163.7139@xmath114 . the strong stellar wind from the ms star",
    "is then accreted by the bh at a moderately low rate compared with the sg case above , resulting in relatively low luminosity bh - ms xrbs powered by stellar wind .",
    "as the ms star evolves across the hg and fills its rl , the bh will spiral into its envelope due to the extremely large mass ratio , leading to a coalescence finally at the time of 8.4605@xmath102myr , immediately after entering the ce phase .",
    "we note that the above evolutionary sequence example may explain why bh binaries with massive ms donors can dominate at lower luminosities , rather than binaries with ns accretors .",
    "it is mainly because of the fact that the sn kicks the compact stars receive during sn explosion are quite different .",
    "as illustrated above , the bh in bh - ms hmxb always receives a small or no sn kick , which facilitates the survival of a wide binary , which would probably produce a faint hmxb .",
    "however it is not the case for nss . due to the much larger sn kicks , the ns is more likely to escape from its companion , leading to the disruption of the binary system . or if survived luckily it may expand its orbit greatly , showing likely as be / x - ray transients when active .",
    "however even so , such a channel is still insignificant when compared with bh - ms hmxbs , as already estimated .    in fig .  5",
    ", we show the evolution of xlf in our basic model , in order to study the nature of the sources , as well as its evolution . both constant star formation ( left ) and",
    "a @xmath115-function like star formation ( right ) cases are studied .",
    "we note that most of the sources are produced within @xmath8 20 myr after the star formation , which is in general agreement with observations @xcite and previous studies @xcite .",
    "we suggest that the short formation and lived time scale of sources may explain why the universal xlf should exist naturally in the star - forming galaxies .",
    "additionally we see that the more recent star formation seems to have more luminous sources , resulting in a much flatter xlf at the high luminosity end .",
    "our results are consistent with earlier observations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , revealing that the different or more complex xlfs are mainly because of the complexity and evolution of the x - ray source populations . moreover the bh - ms hmxbs seem to emerge a little earlier than bh - sg hmxbs .",
    "this can be understood when considering the fact that the sources in both luminosity extremes have distinct formation channels . as illustrated above",
    ", we can see that the appearance of bh - ms sources always accompanies with the birth of the bh accretors , the progenitors of which have a shorter nuclear evolution timescale when compared to the bh - sg hmxbs , the occurrence of which while is mainly driven by the expanding of the less massive donor stars .",
    "however the sg donors have always much stronger stellar winds than ms stars , leading to much brighter bh - sg hmxbs when compared to bh - ms sources .",
    "6 shows xlfs for different models compared to our basic model m1 ( solid line ) .",
    "each model is chosen to examine the effect that each parameter has on both the shape and the absolute source number of the xlf .",
    "several parameters have significant effects on either the shape or the source number or both of the xlfs , while others have only minor effects .",
    "the parameters that have minor effects include the ce efficiency parameter ( @xmath25 ) , and the initial mass ratio distribution of the secondary star , as shown by models m2 and m5 , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath25 dictated how efficiently orbital energy is transformed into the kinetic energy that expels the donor s envelope during the ce phase .",
    "it mainly affects the formation and evolution of binary systems which must go through a ce phase , such as low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) @xcite and cataclysmic variables @xcite .",
    "however this is not the case for hmxbs , as the major formation channels of hmxbs do not involve ce phases as severely as lmxbs @xcite .",
    "we also change @xmath25 to other values and forms ( for details see * ? ? ?",
    "* and comparisons with the @xmath116-algorithm ) .",
    "changing the initial binary mass ratio from a flat distribution ( model m1 ) to a  twins \" distribution ( model m5 ) has little effect on the xlf , although there is a slight increase in the number of bright hmxbs .",
    "this is because hmxbs require mass ratios close to one which is achieved by the  twins \" model which forces mass ratios close to unity .",
    "the binary fraction only affects the absolute source number of the xlf . as shown in fig .",
    "5 an increase of binary fraction ( i.e. , model m3 ) means more xrbs are produced , hence an overall shift of the xlf curve compared to that of the basic model .",
    "a flatter imf ( i.e. , model m6 ) implies a larger number of massive stars , resulting in more compact objects compared to a steeper one .",
    "hence a flatter imf will results in more luminous hmxbs .",
    "we suggest that the diversity of stellar components may explain the normalization dispersions of xlfs between galaxies .",
    "we note that the simulated star - forming galaxy in our basic model only represents a typical case for this kind of galaxies . while for each individual galaxy",
    ", it may have its specific stellar properties , such as different stellar mass distributions ( for both the primary and the secondary ) , and different binary fractions .",
    "our parameter studies ( imf , f and @xmath117 ) precisely support the idea that the normalization dispersion is of a physical origin , proposed by mgs .",
    "however we emphasize that the intrinsic physics governing the binary evolution should keep the same for binaries in these galaxies , as examined below .    in model m4 ,",
    "a significant luminosity break emerges when decreasing the begelman factor @xmath47 by a factor of @xmath820 ( dotted line in figures  6 and 7 , respectively ) .",
    "a similar trend has been found previously @xcite . in order to better constrain the super - eddington factor ,",
    "we modify the begelman factor to 80 ( dash - dotted line ) , 50 ( dash - dot - dotted line ) , 30 ( long - dashed line ) , 10 ( short - dashed line ) , respectively , as shown in fig .",
    "we note the luminosity break exists clearly even for @xmath47 as high as @xmath118 .",
    "this marked contrast with the observed smooth xlf implies that the actual maximum luminosities of accreting bhs can be as high as even @xmath5 times the corresponding eddington luminosities , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "increasing the dispersion velocity @xmath119 means that natal kicks of high magnitude are chosen more frequently from the maxwellian distribution . as a consequence more",
    "binaries are disrupted during the sn explosions .",
    "this decreases the pool of potential hmxbs and may account for the smaller number of hmxbs in model m7 ( dash - dot - dotted line ) as shown in figures  6 and 8 , respectively .",
    "additionally , a larger natal kick can move the wind - fed bh - ms hmxbs into a much wider orbit , too widely separated for stellar material to be effectively accreted onto the bh , resulting in much lower luminosities , and hence a smaller number of bh - ms xrbs in this luminosity range .",
    "this phenomenon is shown clearly in fig .",
    "8 where the dispersion of kick velocity @xmath119 is modified to 190 ( dash - dotted line ) , 170 ( dotted line ) , 100 ( short - dashed line ) , and 50 ( long - dashed line ) , respectively .",
    "we note that compared with our basic model the predicted number of low luminosity hmxbs decreases with increasing natal kicks , while smaller @xmath119 may increase the formation rate of hmxbs remarkably .",
    "specifically , models with high natal kicks ( i.e. , model m7 ) predict significantly less hmxbs than are observed , while models with low natal kicks ( i.e. , @xmath120 ) predict too many hmxbs . based on these results , we conclude that our models in which the natal kick velocity dispersion above @xmath121 or below @xmath122 are inconsistent with the observations .",
    "the typical kicks that match the observed hmxb xlf are on the order of @xmath123 . using a similar method",
    "@xcite proposed a comparable value of natal kick dispersion ( @xmath124 ) to match the observed intrinsic ratio of double and single recycled pulsars in the galactic disc .",
    "our finding is in general consistent with theirs .",
    "it is not surprising as isolated recycled pulsars and double neutron star ( dns ) binaries are both presumably the descendant of ns hmxbs .",
    "our conclusions may further support earlier findings that nss formed in binaries receive significantly smaller natal kicks than the velocities of galactic isolated pulsars would seem to indicate .",
    "stellar winds play an important role in the evolution of high mass stars in two major competing ways",
    ". a stronger stellar wind will increase the accretion rate of wind - fed hmxbs , making it more luminous . on the contrary",
    ", a weaker stellar wind will result in a larger pre - sn mass , and hence the formation of more numerous and more massive bhs .",
    "this may increase the luminosities of hmxb populations , as on the one hand , bh - xrbs can form stable rlo xrbs with more massive companions compared to ns - xrbs , and on the other hand , more massive bhs may drive higher accretion rate , and therefore higher luminosities . comparing models",
    "m1 and m8 , we can see that weaker stellar winds increase both the number and luminosity of bright hmxbs , so the latter effect is the dominant one .",
    "we note here that our findings are also consistent with the results obtained by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our results are subject to some uncertainties and simplified treatments .",
    "for example , in our calculations , only hmxbs with stellar mass bhs are considered .",
    "however imbh which is presumably formed through bh mergers may also show up as ulxs . though it is expected to be significantly less frequent than stellar mass bhs",
    ", we should caution that , even only one of this kind of source may change the high luminosity tail of xlf significantly .",
    "a further careful modeling of imbh considering dynamical formation processes may resolve this problem , however it is beyond the scope of this paper . on the other hand in the framework of stellar mass bhs",
    ", we may see that the ulx population can be generally accounted for by normal hmxbs , only in the case of mild super - eddington accretion rate allowed .",
    "additionally , since little is yet known about , either the detail sfh and imf in star - forming galaxies , or key processes , such as the detailed accretion modes in xrbs , it is difficult to ascertain which parameter combinations are the best or most realistic by comparison with observations .",
    "for example , the normalization of the simulated xlf depends on the adopted values of several parameters , such as the bolometric correction factor @xmath69 and binary fraction @xmath52 .",
    "these two parameters show some degeneracy , and a slightly lower bolometric correction factor would favor a larger binary fraction .",
    "however the overall shape of the simulated xlf depends most strongly on two parameters : the natal kick dispersion @xmath119 and the allowed boost factor of super - eddington accretion rate @xmath47 .",
    "the former , related to the binary interactions , determines the final outcome of the sn explosion .",
    "the latter is related to the accretion behavior , and constrains the location of the break in the xlf .",
    "they jointly determine the shape of the xlf .",
    "conversely , the confirmed universal featureless xlf can make a good decision for the precise choice of the corresponding parameters .",
    "we have used an eps code to model the universal featureless xlf of hmxbs in star - forming galaxies .",
    "we used the apparent universal xlf to constrain models of xrbs .",
    "our study shows that the single , smooth power law xlf can be excellently reproduced with all models considered , but with two parameters strongly affecting its overall shape : the dispersion of natal kick velocity @xmath119 and the introduced parameter",
    " begelman factor \" @xmath47 .",
    "the overall shape and normalization of hmxb xlf need the natal kick dispersion @xmath123 , which is generally consistent with the finding by @xcite based on the statistics of double and single recycled pulsars .",
    "our xlf modeling further strengthens earlier finding that nss formed in close interacting binaries receive significantly smaller natal kicks than the velocities of galactic single pulsars would indicate .",
    "the absence of features in the xlf near the critical eddington luminosity of a ns or a stellar - mass bh and the cut - off luminosity at @xmath125 need the allowed boost factor of super - eddington accretion rate as high as @xmath126 .",
    "our results give strong supports for the suggestion by @xcite that the bulk of ulxs may indeed be the high - luminosity extension of ordinary hmxbs which harbor stellar - mass bhs with mildly super - eddington accretion rate , rather than exotic intermediate - mass objects .",
    "we present the detail components of hmxb populations which contribute to the observed xlf , and emphasize that the low luminosity sources of @xmath127 are mainly wind - fed bh systems powered by high mass ( @xmath128 ) ms stars with orbital periods around months to @xmath92 days which have not yet been verified in nearby star - forming galaxies due to limited instrument capabilities .",
    "our work motivates further high - resolution x - ray and optical observations of hmxb populations in nearby star - forming galaxies .",

    "<S> using an updated population synthesis code initially developed by hurley et al . </S>",

    "<S> our main goal is to use the universal xlf to constrain the model parameters , given the current knowledge of binary evolution . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the one - dimensional ( 1d ) maxwellian velocity dispersion of the natal kick can be constrained to be of the order of @xmath0 , supporting earlier findings that neutron stars ( nss ) formed in binaries seem to receive significantly smaller natal kicks than the velocities of galactic single pulsars would indicate . </S>",
    "<S> the super - eddington accretion factor is further confirmed in the framework of stellar mass black holes ( bhs ) , revealing the true origin of the most of the ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) may indeed be the high - luminosity extension of ordinary hmxbs which harbor stellar - mass bhs rather than exotic intermediate - mass bhs or ones . </S>",
    "<S> we present the detail properties of the model - predicted present - day hmxbs , which may be investigated by future high - resolution x - ray and optical observations of sources in nearby star - forming galaxies . </S>"
