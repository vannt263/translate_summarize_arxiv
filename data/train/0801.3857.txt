    "since the early 1970 s , spatially resolved observations of the solar corona have revealed a high degree of structuring over all scales , from of order of the solar radius down to instrumental resolution limits ( e.g. , @xcite ) . this spatial structuring",
    "is intimately linked to the characteristics of magnetic field generation and interaction , and to plasma heating mechanisms . on other stars , especially very active ones ( with x - ray luminosity @xmath2 up to @xmath3 ) , coronal structure and its relation with stellar parameters such as",
    "mass , rotation and evolutionary phase , remains very uncertain .",
    "techniques used to date to investigate the morphology of stellar coronae comprise rotational modulation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , flare modeling ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter ) , eclipse mapping ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , spectroscopic density and radiation field diagnostics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , resonance scattering ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , velocity modulation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and simultaneous doppler imaging and x - ray spectroscopy @xcite .    the fluorescent iron line at @xmath46.4  kev presents a further , potentially powerful diagnostic of stellar coronal geometry .",
    "extensively used in study of active galactic nuclei and x - ray binaries ( see e.g.  reviews @xcite ) , and often seen on the sun during flares @xcite , the line is produced by electron cascade after one of the two k - shell ( @xmath5=1 ) electrons of an iron atom ( or ion ) is ejected following photoelectric absorption of x - rays . in the solar and stellar case , for a given irradiating flare spectrum",
    "the line strength depends essentially on three parameters : the flare height , heliocentric angle , and photospheric fe abundance ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter d07b ) .",
    "if it can be observed in stars , fe  k fluorescence therefore presents a means of estimating flare and coronal scale height .",
    "fe fluorescence has now been detected on a number of pre - main sequence stars with disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where it is most likely produced by coronal x - ray irradiation of the cold disk material .",
    "here we present evidence for _ photospheric _ fe fluorescent emission in the  spectrum of the x - ray active single g1 giant  ( see  and references therein for a description of the characteristics of the target ) .",
    "the observations and analysis are briefly described in  [ s : obs ] . in  [ s : model ] we present 3d monte carlo calculations of the fe k@xmath0 fluorescence . the results are presented in ",
    "[ s : results ] , where we derive an estimate for the coronal scale height and compare it with the prediction of the loop hydrodynamic model that succeeds in describing the observed flaring spectrum ( ) . to our knowledge , the  _ chandra _ spectrum represents only the second detection of fe photospheric fluorescence .",
    "very recently , the line was observed by the _ swift _ x - ray telescope during a `` superflare '' on the rs  cvn binary system ii  peg by @xcite , who ascribed the excitation mechanism to electron impact ionization of photospheric fe instead of photoionization .",
    "we discuss our result and the ii  peg observations in  [ s : discuss ] , and show that the latter is also consistent with , and more plausibly associated with , photoionization than electron impact .",
    "high energy transmission grating @xcite observations of  ( obsid 1892 ) were discussed in detail by   that analyzed the x - ray spectra and variability of  and constructed a flaring loop hydrodynamic model that successfully reproduced the observations .",
    "we analyse the same data here , using the pintofale idl software @xcite , and the interactive spectral interpretation system ( isis ) version 1.4.2 @xcite .    the  flare spectrum ( first 40  ks of the observation ) in the wavelength region with the fe  k@xmath0 emission",
    "is illustrated in figure  [ fig : spectra ] ( _ top panel _ ) , together with a comparison between the evolution of the fluorescent and adjacent continuum emission ( _ bottom panel _ ) .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test applied to the lightcurves of fe k@xmath0 and the nearby continuum indicates that they are significantly different during the flare ( @xmath6 ) , but @xmath7 during the rest of the observation .",
    "the fe k@xmath0 line flux was measured with isis by convolving a gaussian profile with the instrumental response , using the continuum predicted by an isothermal spectral model described in  [ s : model ] ( and derived in ) .",
    "we obtained an fe k@xmath0 line flux of @xmath8  ph  @xmath9  s@xmath10 , with a corresponding 90% confidence range @xmath11  ph  @xmath9  s@xmath10 .",
    "the basic physics of fe fluorescent line production on the sun has been investigated through detailed monte carlo calculations of the interaction between a hard x - ray continuum ( @xmath12  kev ) and dense , neutral photospheric material by @xcite , considering a thermal continuum and taking into account the curvature of the solar photosphere .",
    "the problem has been further discussed in detail in the stellar context by d07b .",
    "we used a modified version of the 3d radiative transfer code mocassin @xcite , to carry out monte carlo calculations to follow the fe k@xmath0 photons resulting from x - ray absorption and to determine the emerging fe k@xmath0 emission as a function of the flare geometry parameters illustrated in figure  [ fig : geom ] . here",
    ", our method differs from the calculations of @xcite in that we can use any given input fluorescing spectrum , whereas @xcite adopted an analytical expression for the thermal bremsstrahlung continuum and computed a grid for t in the range 0.5 - 5  kev .",
    "detailed descriptions of the methods used for the fluorescence calculations are presented by d07b .",
    "we note that the fluorescence efficiency , @xmath13 , defined as the ratio of the fe  k@xmath0 flux to one - half the integral of the x - ray flux above 7.11  kev ( @xmath14 $ ] ) is only very weakly dependent on the photospheric metallicity , [ m / h ] ( d07b ) . for  no accurate photospheric abundances were available , and we therefore obtained optical spectra with the high resolution ( @xmath15 ) spectrograph sarg at the telescopio nazionale galileo , and derived a near - solar photospheric fe abundance @xmath16 } = -0.2 \\pm 0.3 $ ] ( l.  affer et al .  in prep .",
    ") . based on the calculations of d07b",
    ", we find an uncertainty in @xmath13 of @xmath17%   for a metallicity uncertainty range [ m / h]@xmath18@xmath19 , including allowance for an overabundance of @xmath0-elements with respect to fe at the low metallicity end of 0.2 - 0.3  dex ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in order to compute @xmath13 we used a fluorescing spectral model with @xmath20 } = 7.8 $ ] , and @xmath21 } = 54.9 $ ] , based on the values found from the analysis of the continuum emission in the early phases of the flare ( see fig .  6 of ) .",
    "this was preferred over a spectrum computed using the emission measure distribution , @xmath22 , derived for the flare as a whole ( rise + peak + decay ; see figs .  3 and 6 of )",
    "because most of the fe k@xmath0 emission is detected in the rise , peak , and early decay phases : the use of the whole flare @xmath22 would slightly underestimate the hard x - ray flux .",
    "values of @xmath13 were calculated assuming a point source for the flare and for a range of flare heights , @xmath23 .",
    "the results obtained for a range of flare heights and line - of - sight viewing angles are shown in figure  [ fig : mod_obs ] .",
    "as expected , the model fluorescent efficiency declines strongly for larger values of @xmath23 , the height of the flaring source .",
    "this occurs because of the @xmath24 dilution of the irradiating surface flux , and because photon incidence angles become larger , causing the average depth where the photoionization takes place to increase . for the line - of - sight viewing angle @xmath25 , the fluorescence efficiency depends primarily upon @xmath23 but not on @xmath26 ; for @xmath27 , the efficiency rapidly decreases .",
    "in  we modeled the observed flare using a hydrodynamic treatment of the evolution of the flaring plasma within the confines of a single long loop .",
    "the hydrodynamic model provides us with the physical conditions ( in particular t and ) of each plasma volume element along the loop , allowing us to compute the expected fe k@xmath0 emission for a direct comparison with the measured fluorescence efficiency . in order to calculate the @xmath13 induced by the emission of the flaring loop as resulting from the hydrodynamic modeling we proceeded as follows :",
    "( 1 ) we synthesized hard x - ray spectra ( 7 - 50  kev ) for isothermal plasmas for a grid of temperatures covering a large t range ( @xmath28 ) ; ( 2 ) we divided the half - loop in four different segments and computed hard x - ray spectrum of each segment by adding the spectra of all volume elements ( each characterized by a temperature and emission measure ) within the segment , integrating over the 40  ks of the flare ; ( 3 ) we computed the expected fluorescence emission induced by each segment , depending on its input spectrum and corresponding height , and computed the overall fe k@xmath0 emission , and therefore the predicted @xmath13 . splitting the loop in segments",
    "linearly spaced in @xmath23 ( i.e. , @xmath29 ) , assuming that the loop is perpendicular to the stellar surface , we obtain @xmath30 .",
    "we also computed the efficiency using a logarithmic spacing ( @xmath31 ) , and we find @xmath32 only slightly different from the former value .",
    "to compare the observed fe  k@xmath0 flux with model values , we used the same spectral model based on the observed continuum described above .",
    "the one - half integrated x - ray flux above 7.11  kev ( up to 50  kev ) as computed from this model is @xmath33  ph  @xmath9  s@xmath10 , which , when combined with the observed fe  k@xmath0 flux , yields a value for the observed fluorescence efficiency @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "we note that at 50  kev the flux is already several orders of magnitude lower than at 7.11  kev , therefore the efficiency does not depend significantly on this upper bound value used for the energy range . in figure",
    "[ fig : mod_obs ] the measured value , with the 90%   confidence range , is represented as a shaded area superimposed to the theoretical curves derived in ",
    "[ s : model ] .",
    "the comparison between observed and model values of @xmath13 implies for the scale height an upper limit of @xmath35 , where @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "this result compares well with the hydrodynamic modeling that finds a loop semi - length @xmath37  ( ) , corresponding to a loop apex at @xmath38 @xmath39  ( assuming that the loop is perpendicular to the stellar surface , otherwise @xmath40 ) . the efficiency expected on the basis of the hydrodynamic model itself corresponds to an `` effective scale height '' @xmath41somewhat lower that the maximum height of the loop model .",
    "this can be understood on the basis of the extreme characteristics of the flaring loop in , which is much hotter than typical solar flares : for solar flares , typically reaching temperatures @xmath42  k , the hard x - ray photons above the 7.11  kev threshold will be emitted almost uniquely by the hotter loop apex ; instead , in the flaring loop on , with peak temperature of the order of @xmath43  k , the lower coronal plasma will still be effective in producing hard x - ray photons because of its elevated temperature ( of several @xmath44",
    "k ) and density .",
    "we have presented the first detailed analysis of observed photospheric fluorescence to probe the geometric properties of stellar coronal emission . for the flare on",
    "we find the observed fe  k@xmath0 intensity completely consistent with production through photospheric irradiation by flare x - rays .",
    "our estimate for the flare scale height of @xmath45  provides a cross - check for the results of the hydrodynamic modeling of the flare observed on  that can be satisfactorily reproduced by a single flaring loop of semi - length @xmath46 .",
    "the agreement between the observed @xmath13 and the value computed directly from this model provides further confidence both in the hydrodynamic modeling approach and x - ray fluorescence as the excitation mechanism for the fe  k@xmath0 line .",
    "we note that our model based on  data might underestimate the high energy continuum flux because we can not detect any additional ( either thermal or non - thermal ) emission possibly present at energies outside the  band .",
    "however , if additional high energy emission were present , the higher flux above 7.11  kev would make the efficiency lower bringing it in even better agreement with the predictions of the model .    as noted in ",
    "[ s : intro ] , fe k@xmath0 emission has been extensively observed in solar x - ray spectra during flares @xcite .",
    "two main production mechanisms were initially explored to explain the line : electron impact from a non - thermal electron population , and x - ray photoionization . the observed fe k@xmath0 evolution with respect to the thermal and non - thermal emission , and the observed center - to - limb variations seen on the sun , strongly support the x - ray fluorescence mechanism @xcite ,",
    "although in rare cases there is indication that electron impact might contribute during the early impulsive phase ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "@xcite have also shown that fe  k production in accretion disks by non - thermal electron bombardment is extremely unlikely , and requires 2 - 4 orders of magnitude greater energy dissipation in the electron beam than is required for an x - ray photoionization source . in this context , the recent observations of an extremely large fe  k@xmath0 equivalent width in the pms star v1486  ori @xcite , and variability in fe  k@xmath0 emission uncorrelated with the observed x - ray continuum on elias 29 @xcite , seem to challenge the photoionization excitation mechanism .",
    "however , d07b note that fluorescence from pms disks excited by x - rays originating from the unseen stellar hemisphere will also be observed : in @xmath47%  of cases , fe  k@xmath0 can then appear anomalous when compared only to the _ observed _ thermal continuum .    to date , the _ swift _ observation of ii  peg @xcite is the only other case where fe  k@xmath0 emission has been observed for a star ( other than the sun ) lacking substantial circumstellar material .",
    "@xcite dismissed x - ray fluorescence as the excitation mechanism based on arguments for fluorescence in an optically - thin medium , and instead attributed the fe k@xmath0 to electron impact with non - thermal electrons .",
    "as noted in earlier discussions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , one major problem for an electron impact excitation mechanism is the inefficiency of this process .",
    "extremely large energies must be dissipated in accelerated electron beams to produce continuum and fluorescence emission that might be observed on a star .",
    "indeed , @xcite showed that the hard x - ray continuum observed in the ii  peg flare would require an energy of @xmath48  ergs in non - thermal electrons if interpreted in terms of thick - target bremsstrahlung . over the time of the duration of the flare",
    ", this corresponds to an energy dissipation rate in accelerated electrons of more than 100 times the stellar bolometric luminosity .",
    "the hard x - rays are also interpreted as lasting for timescales comparable with the flare soft x - ray emission , at variance with the sun where this non - thermal component , when present , is generally impulsive .",
    "regardless of the true nature of the hard x - ray flux , the equivalent width measured from the ii  peg _ swift _ spectra ranges between 18 and 60  ev , corresponding to efficiency values @xmath13 between 1% and 2% .",
    "these values are well within the range found from the theoretical calculations presented here , and comparable with the measured value for . since the non - thermal hard x - ray component in the ii  peg flare is not well - constrained by the _",
    "swift _ data and could also be explained by thermal emission , the observed fe  k@xmath0 line seems more easily explained as arising from photoionization by flare x - rays ( see also the discussion of d07b ) .",
