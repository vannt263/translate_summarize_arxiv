    "phonons are , however , a nuisance for many applications , in particular for quantum sciences where they lead to decoherence mechanisms @xcite .",

    "one single mode is cooled but the effective temperature of the system is generally not decreased .",
    "in contrast to the research directions outlined above , the goal of optical refrigeration is to cool all mechanical modes of an entire structure , which results in temperature and entropy reduction .",
    "this could lead to a compact solid - state refrigerator able to reach cryogenic temperatures with light @xcite without cryogenic fluids or moving parts .",
    "optical refrigeration in solids relies on up - conversion luminescence ( also referred to as anti - stokes luminescence , which must not be confused with nonlinear optical effects , such as parametric up - conversion ) , which blue - shifts the emitted light with respect to the light entering the system in the first place .",

    "optical pumping of carriers into a long - lived excited state located a few @xmath14 in energy below a much faster recombination channel @xcite can lead to an efficient heat extraction as the carriers recombine through the higher - energy state after absorbing thermal energy .",
    "indirect and direct electron - hole pairs confined in coupled quantum wells ( cqws ) in an electric field fulfill this criterion of long and short lifetime , respectively .    the lifetime of the indirect excitons in cqws can be enhanced by at least two orders of magnitude by means of applied electric fields @xcite .",
    "this indicates that their quantum efficiency can exceed 99% , because any non - radiative effects would set a lower bound to how much the lifetime can be reduced .",
    "this renders cqws promising for optical refrigeration .",
    "local carrier cooling effects have been observed with indirect excitons in cqws structures @xcite but the cooling of the entire crystal lattice was neither intended nor achieved . as opposed to previous theoretical works on optical refrigeration with single quantum wells ( qws ) , we propose here for the first time using cqws to cool an entire nanostructure .",
    "we find that by optimizing the thickness and alloy composition of the cqws embedded in a suspended nanomembrane , a temperature drop of 80 k from room temperature is predicted with 1 w of laser power , corresponding to a cooling efficiency per photon @xmath15 of around 3% .",
    "although this cooling efficiency is comparable to that of other semiconductor platforms or rare - earth doped glasses @xcite , the tunability of carrier lifetimes and energy levels with an applied bias allow to optimize the cooling efficiency over time as the thermal population @xmath14 decreases with cooling .",
    "coupled quantum wells in a constant electric field along the growth direction support essentially two different types of electron - hole pairs ( ehps ) : direct and indirect @xcite .",
    "electrons and holes located in the two different qws form indirect ehps with small spatial overlap resulting in a long lifetime . electrons and holes located in the same qw form direct ehps with a strong spatial overlap and correspondingly shorter lifetime . a similar configuration of indirect and direct ehps can be achieved using type - ii qws @xcite .",

    "this is a significant improvement as compared to 4.8% in cdse nanostructures @xcite or 3.5% in type - ii qws @xcite .",
    "as shown below , however , the best cooling performance is not obtained by maximizing the cooling efficiency because it is necessarily associated with a low absorption . in the next section ,",

    "this is particularly critical for bulk materials because the photon - escape probability is low and thus the re - absorption probability is high .",

    "thus there is an optimal configuration in which the cooling yield @xmath65 is maximized , which is reached at @xmath89 v. here , the absorption @xmath90 is about two orders of magnitude larger than at 0 v but the radiative recombination rates @xmath77 and @xmath91 are also comparable , thus the advantageous property @xmath87 can not be exploited . in this configuration",

    "the configuration allowing the highest cooling yield shows that it is sufficient that @xmath77 is smaller but not much smaller than @xmath96 ( see fig .  [",

    "the latter is the relevant quantity for the experimental realisation of optical refrigeration .",
    "this is favoured by the enhanced absorption of the membrane despite the lower cooling efficiency .",
    "it means that more photons are involved in the refrigeration process but that each photon removes little thermal energy . in this case , the influence of non - radiative losses or parasitic heating increases @xcite .",
    "additionally , total internal reflection limits the escape of emitted light from the sample , thus increasing the probability of parasitic absorption .",
    "this issue can be prevented by using a solid immersion lens @xcite on the sample surface or by shaping the density of optical states at the frequency of the re - emitted photons by a second - order bragg grating @xcite or a photonic crystal @xcite .",
    "we have proposed using cqws for optical refrigeration .",
    "they exhibit a favorable combination of properties originating from the very different radiative lifetimes for direct and indirect electron - hole pairs .",
    "we have shown that cqws , whose dimensions and composition have been optimized , can be cooled by 80 k with 1 w of optical power from room temperature with an associated cooling efficiency per photon of around 3% .",
    "this cooling efficiency is similar to that of other semiconductor platforms or rare - earth doped glasses . despite the moderate cooling efficiency ,",
    "an advantage of cqws is the ability to tune the lifetime and energy of the different transitions by applying a voltage across the structure .",
    "this allows cooling to lower temperatures because the energy levels can be tuned dynamically to maintain optimum refrigeration as the thermal population drops due to the decreasing temperature .",
    "our cooling yield is below the reported value for cdse nanostructures of 6.3 k / mw in @xcite but higher than that of experiments on rare - earth doped glasses , which use high laser powers @xcite .    coupled quantum wells",
    "offer a great opportunity to tailor the cooling efficiency and the cooling yield as opposed to previous proposals concerned with single qws .",
    "the initial requirement of having @xmath100 in order to achieve efficient optical refrigeration is unfortunately achieved by reducing the recombination rate of the indirect state rather than enhancing that of the direct states .",
    "this results in a low absorption and subsequent limited cooling yield .",
    "we have investigated several ways of improving the absorption such as using a micro - cavity @xcite or using side excitation @xcite to increase the path length of photons in the sample .",
    "however , side excitation creates a gradient in carrier concentration , which , due to screening , would lead to a varying electric field .",
    "this makes resonant excitation impractical as the spectral position of the indirect ehp state varies at different places in the membrane .",
    "likewise , a cavity favours photon re - absorption , thus setting a more strict requirement on the quantum efficiency .",
    "these considerations favour single - pass structures where the light propagates in the same direction as the applied electric field , as considered in the present work .",
    "the use of cqws in a suspended membrane could lead to a successful refrigeration experiment using a high power laser spread on a large area ( i.e. , with low intensity ) because the suspended membrane is expected to yield very little parasitic heating @xcite .",
    "the success of the experiment could also be eased by further increasing the thermal resistance of the tethers holding the suspended region to be cooled .",
    "we would like to thank the lundbeck foundation , the carlsberg foundation , and the european research council ( erc consolidator grant `` allquantum '' ) for financial support ."
