    "the part @xmath5 will not be considered , since i am only interested in the electron motion along the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "this geometry is realized experimentally in two - dimensional electron gases .",
    "the classical equations of motion are readily derived : @xmath6 + \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } \\frac{{{\\cal e}}_y}{{{\\cal b}}}t+\\frac{p_y(0)}{{{\\cal b}}e}\\\\ \\frac{m{{\\cal e}}_y}{{{\\cal b}}^2 e}-\\frac{p_x(0)}{{{\\cal b}}e } \\end{array } \\right].\\ ] ] the initial position and velocity vectors are given by @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the most remarkable property of the motion is the on average ( over one period @xmath9 ) constant drift - velocity : @xmath10 the drift - velocity @xmath11 is also independent of the initial velocity @xmath12 .",
    "every electron that starts at @xmath7 will propagate .",
    "the constant drift - velocity has important consequences for the transport of electrons in a solid which is placed in a magnetic field . in a classical hall experiment deflected",
    "electrons form an electric field along the edges of a metal .",
    "the conducting electrons propagate in the presence of this electric hall field , which can be used to determine the carrier - density in the sample @xcite . completely neglecting scattering events",
    ", we can extract the basic relation between the classical current @xmath13 @xmath14 ( @xmath15 denotes the electron density , @xmath16 the electronic charge ) and the resistivity tensor @xmath17 ( or it s inverse , the conductivity tensor @xmath18 ) from ohm s law : @xmath19 one obtains a finite value of the conductivity even in the absence of any scatterers . without crossed fields , scattering events are used to establish an effective friction force and thus a finite classical conductivity .",
    "current theories of the quantum version of the hall effect are not based on the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonexb ] ) , but rather on @xmath20}^2/(2 m ) + v_{\\rm ld}(\\bm{r}),\\ ] ] where @xmath21 denotes a periodic lattice potential and possibly uncorrelated disorder potentials ( which are often assumed to disappear on the average : @xmath22 ) .",
    "this hamiltonian differs from the classical hall hamiltonian by the omission of the electric hall field .",
    "the disorder potential becomes an essential part of the description and the appearance of a quantized conductivity is linked to the presence of a fluctuating potential - landscape @xmath23 @xcite .    in this contribution i do not follow this road .",
    "instead i consider the implications of a quantization of the original hall - hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonexb ] ) .",
    "i show that under appropriate boundary conditions this hamiltonian produces a quantized conductivity  even without disorder potentials .",
    "the inclusion of imperfections is of course desirable , but beyond the scope of this contribution .",
    "this question is of crucial importance for the theoretical description of a quantum hall system .",
    "if the answer would be yes , one could use the same derivation as for the classical hall effect and would obtain an unchanged conductivity tensor : no quantization occurs , and the theory of a quantized transport must be based on different effects .",
    "two arguments are used to claim that the quantum and classical result for the drift - motion are equal :    1 .",
    "many textbooks and reviews describe a translationally invariant system @xcite .",
    "it is correctly noticed that in a frame moving with the classical drift velocity , the electric field vanishes .",
    "the presumed implications are that the electric field can not influence the current , since it is possible to eliminate it by a going to a moving coordinate - system .",
    "however , translational invariance must be broken , since the quantized current is observed .",
    "the only way to achieve the breaking of invariance in this approach is due to the presence of disorder .",
    "+   + * but : * translational invariance is never realized in a hall system .",
    "contacts are present in every direction and electrons will enter the system at the fixed gate - positions . secondly , it is not enough to transform the already emitted electron .",
    "instead one has to transform the electron - emitting contacts , too .",
    "it is well know in atomic physics that the emittance rate of a moving source in a magnetic field changes drastically ( new experimental data and a theoretical description are presented in @xcite ) .",
    "it is plainly impossible to map the crossed - field problem to a two - dimensional electron - gas in a purely magnetic field without accounting for that motion and the presence of an external current .",
    "another argument uses the quantum - mechanical expectation value of the momentum operator between eigenstates @xmath24 of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonexb ] ) @xcite : @xmath25 this expectation value is indeed identical to the classical time - averaged drift velocity .",
    "+   + * but : * in a quantum system with contacts , the expectation value of the momentum alone does not determine the current .",
    "a current is only possible if there is a free state available , which can be occupied by the electron .",
    "this is the basic idea of every band - model in solid - state physics .",
    "one calculates the density of states @xmath26 of the system and then one fills up the available states according to pauli s exclusion principle . for a non - interacting fermi - gas at zero temperature ,",
    "the upper limit is determined by the fermi energy .",
    "the current is the product of the expectation value with the emission rate ( for details , see @xcite , sec .",
    "surprisingly , the purely quantum - mechanically density of states can be linked to the classical equations of motion @xcite . without any external fields ,",
    "the density of states in two - dimensions becomes a constant , whereas a purely magnetic field leads to a series of discrete landau levels .    for a non - zero electric field , this is no longer true and the local density density of states ( ldos ) becomes a smooth function of the energy @xcite .",
    "interestingly , between two former landau levels the ldos is extremely suppressed and thus a transport is not possible .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the classical result , in which electrons propagate independently of their initial energy .",
    "even more surprising , another suppression of the ldos happens inside a former landau level , which leads to the possibility of fractionally filled levels .",
    "these regions of strong transport blocking are transformed into plateaus of constant conductivity @xcite .",
    "notice that the construction of a global current pattern from the ldos is subject to a coarse - graining procedure , which involves a model of the spatial variation of the fermi - level , for details see @xcite . here , i just consider a point - like contact at the origin @xmath27 , that might already serve as a model for an array of point - contacts with adjusted fermi levels @xcite .    the basic idea for a semiclassical interpretation of the ldos in crossed fields is given by closed orbit theory @xcite , which i will apply now .",
    "v / m and magnetic field @xmath28  t. [ fig : compare],scaledwidth=100.0% ]    classical orbits , which lead from the origin back to the origin , are best found by using the classical action .",

    "the dashed line denotes the integration path .",

    "the agreement between the quantum - mechanical oscillator functions and the interfering classical orbits is striking : properly weighted classical trajectories lead to a quantization into separated levels with a substructure .",
    "note that the number of trajectories is not changed in a single level .",
    "only the relative phase modulates the ldos .",
    "i have shown , that the transport - blocking in crossed fields can be related to the interference of classical trajectories .",
    "the blocking can be viewed as a destructive interference of multiple closed trajectories .",
