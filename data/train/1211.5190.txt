    "many complex natural and man - made systems ( e.g. , biological , ecological , physical , social , financial , and computational ) are modeled as stochastic processes in order to handle either a lack of knowledge or inherent randomness .",
    "these systems are frequently studied in interaction with discrete systems , such as controllers , or with interactive environments having continuous behavior .",
    "this context has motivated research aiming to develop a general theory of systems able to uniformly treat discrete , continuous and hybrid reactive systems .",
    "two of the central questions of this research are _",
    "`` when do two systems behave similarly up to some quantifiable observation error ? '' _ and _ `` is there any ( algorithmic ) technique to check whether two systems have similar behaviours?''_. these questions are related to the problems of state space reduction ( collapsing a model to an equivalent reduced model ) and discretization ( reduce a continuous or hybrid system to an equivalent discrete one ) , which are cornerstones in the field of stochastic systems .    for probabilistic systems ,",
    "the concept of _ probabilistic bisimulation _ introduced by larsen and skou  @xcite is the standard concept for reasoning about probabilistic behaviours .",
    "it relates probabilistic systems with identical probabilistic behaviour , see  @xcite for an expository introduction .",
    "labelled markov processes are the probabilistic analogs of labelled transition systems with state spaces that might be continuous . the theory of probabilistic bisimulation has been appropriately extended to cover the case of continuous - state spaces and continuous distributions  @xcite .",
    "in addition , probabilistic multimodal logics ( pmls ) have been used to characterize the probabilistic bisimilarity @xcite .    despite the elegant theories supporting it ,",
    "the concept of bisimulation remains too strict for applications . in modelling",
    ", the values of the parameters ( rates or probabilities ) are often approximated and consequently , one is interested to know whether two processes that differ by a small amount in real - valued parameters show similar ( not necessarily identical ) behaviours . in such cases , instead of a bisimulation relation , one needs a metric concept to estimate the degree of similarity of two systems in terms of their behaviours . the metric theory for markov processes",
    "was initiated by desharnais et al .",
    "@xcite and greatly developed and explored by van breugel , worrell and others  @xcite .",
    "one way to do this is to relax the satisfiability relation in the logic and replace it with a function that reports the `` degree of satisfiability '' between a markov process and a logical property .",
    "this further induces a _ behavioural pseudometric _ on processes measuring the distance between processes in terms of their behavioural similarity .",
    "it was hoped that these metrics would provide a quantitative alternative to logic , but this did not happen .",
    "one reason could originate in the fact that all this `` metric reasoning '' focused exclusively on the semantics of the logic while a syntactic counterpart did not develop .",
    "when we published @xcite , which is the restricted version of this paper , there existed no attempt of understanding what a behaviour pseudometric might mean logically .",
    "we emphasized that , in the context of a completely axiomatized logic , the semantic distance between markov processes implicitly induces , via hausdorff metrics , a distance between probabilistic and stochastic logical properties . on this line",
    ", @xcite contains the open ideas of a research program that we have followed ever since .",
    "this research aims to understand the relation between the pseudometric space of markov processes and the pseudometric space of logical formulas i.e. , the relation between the measure of similarity of behaviours for markov processes and the measure of provability in a corresponding stochastic / probabilistic logic .",
    "eventually , in @xcite we studied how convergence in the open ball topologies induced by the two pseudometrics `` agree to the limit '' and in @xcite we proposed an effective on - the - fly algorithm to compute such metric for markov chains .",
    "this paper provides the corner stone for our research program : we provide weak and strong complete axiomatizations for the most general logic that express properties of stochastic labelled markov processes .",
    "we call it _ continuous markovian logic _ ( cml ) .",
    "it is similar to pml , but developed for general _ continuous - time and continuous - space labelled markov processes _ , henceforth continuous markov processes ( cmps ) @xcite .",
    "cml is endowed with modal operators indexed with transition labels and positive rationals . for a label @xmath0 and a positive rational @xmath1",
    ", the formula @xmath2 in cml expresses the fact that the rate of the @xmath0-transitions from the current state to the set of states satisfying @xmath3 is _ at least @xmath1 _ ; similarly , @xmath4 states that the rate is _ at most @xmath1_. in this respect , our logic is similar to the aumann s system @xcite developed for harsanyi type spaces @xcite .    in spite of their syntactic similarities ,",
    "cml and pml are very different . in the probabilistic case axiomatized by zhou in his phd thesis @xcite the two modal operators are dual , related by de morgan laws such as @xmath5 and @xmath6 , which express the fact that the probability of a transition from a state @xmath7 to a state satisfying @xmath3 and the probability of a transition from @xmath7 to a state satisfying @xmath8 sum to @xmath9 . in the stochastic case",
    "the two modalities are independent",
    ". moreover , there exists no sound equivalence of type @xmath10 for @xmath11 , since the rate of the transitions from @xmath7 to the set of states satisfying @xmath3 is not related to the rate of the transitions from @xmath7 to the set of states satisfying @xmath8 .",
    "hence , for cml formulas , no positive normal forms can be defined .",
    "obviously , these differences are also reflected in the complete axiomatizations that we present both for cml and for its fragment without @xmath12-operators .",
    "many axioms of pml , such as @xmath13 or @xmath14 for @xmath15 , are not sound for cmps .",
    "another important difference between pml and cml regards their metaproperties .",
    "the proof of the finite model property for pml , done in @xcite , on which many other results such as decidability or weak completeness are centered , relays on the fact that in @xmath16 $ ] there are finitely many rationals of a given denominator .",
    "when one moves from probabilistic to stochastic processes , i.e. , from probabilistic distributions to arbitrary distributions , this proof can not be reproduced and for this reason decidability and weak completeness for cml remained open problems for some time . in this paper",
    "we prove the finite model property for cml using a nontrivial variation of zhou s construction .",
    "this is one of the major contribution of this paper .",
    "the construction of a finite model for a consistent cml - formula is also relevant in the context of pseudometrics .",
    "it provides an approximation techniques to evaluate the quantitative extension of satisfiability relation induced by the behavioural pseudometric .",
    "formally , the _ quantitative satisfiability _ is a function @xmath17 that associates to a cmp @xmath18 and a cml formula @xmath19 a value @xmath20 that measures the distance between @xmath21 and the set of processes satisfying @xmath3 : @xmath22 iff @xmath23 .",
    "this function induces a distance on the space of logical formulas , @xmath24 defined by @xmath25 we observe that , in the context of a complete axiomatization , the distance @xmath26 measures the similarity between logical formulas in terms of provability : @xmath3 and @xmath27 are at distance 0 in @xmath28 if they can both be entailed from the same consistent theories . in this context",
    "we prove the _ strong robustness theorem _",

    "this guarantees the _ weak robustness theorem _ : @xmath34 using this second theorem , one can evaluate @xmath35 from the value of @xmath36 .",
    "of course , the accuracy of this approximation depends on the similarity between @xmath3 and @xmath27 from a provability perspective , which influences both the distance @xmath37 and the parameter @xmath38 of the finite model construction .    to summarize , the achievements of this paper are as follows .",
    "@xmath39    we introduce continuous markovian logic , a modal logic that expresses quantitative and qualitative properties of continuous markov processes .",
    "cml is endowed with operators that approximate the labelled transition rates of cmps and allows us to reason on approximated properties .",
    "this logic characterizes the stochastic bisimulation of cmps .",
    "we present weak and strong completeness results for cml and for its fragment without @xmath12 operators .",
    "these are very different from the similar probabilistic cases , due to the structural differences between probabilistic and stochastic models ; and the differences are reflected by the axioms .",
    "we prove the finite model properties for cml and its restricted fragment .",
    "the construction of a finite model for a consistent formula is novel in the way it exploits the archimedian properties of positive rationals .",
    "we extend the construction to define canonic models for the two logics .",
    "we define a distance between logical formulas related to the distance between a model and a formula proposed in the literature for probabilistic systems .",
    "the organization of the space of logical formulas as a pseudometric space , with a topology sensitive to provability , is a novelty in the field of metric semantics .",
    "this structure guarantees the strong robustness theorem .",

    "one of the problems , that we postpone for future work , is finding a classification of the functions @xmath646 to reflect properties of @xmath28 .",
    "for instance , in collaboration with prakash panangaden @xcite , we have proven that if @xmath646 satisfies some specific continuity conditions , then @xmath28 characterizes the logical equivalence between formulas without negation in the probabilistic case and between formulas without negation and without @xmath12 operators in the stochastic case , i.e. , only for some special @xmath3 and @xmath32 we have [ @xmath731 iff @xmath732 .",
    "however , the problem of finding a formal characterization of the kernel of @xmath28 remains open . in the same paper we gave topological characterizations of the pseudometric space of logical formulas for probabilistic and for the markovian logics . at the topological level",
    "one can see better the differences between the two logics . for the probabilistic logic",
    "the situation is quite simple : the set @xmath225 of models satisfying @xmath3 is closed whenever @xmath3 does not involve negation and open otherwise . for the markovian logics the situation is much more complicated and",
    "the sets @xmath225 can , in various cases , produce open , closed , @xmath733 or @xmath734 sets of models set is a countable intersection of open sets and a @xmath734 set in a countable union of closed sets . ] .",
    "there exist , however , distances enjoying even stronger properties such as [ @xmath216 iff @xmath735 , @xmath736 .",
    "each of these metrics organizes the set of logical formulas as a pseudometric space with specific topological properties .",
    "the complete axiomatization is probably the key for classifying such structures and for understanding the relationship between the topological space of models and the topological space of logical formulas .",
    "this research was supported by the vkr center of excellence mt - lab and by the sino - danish basic research center idea4cps .",
    "mardare was also supported by sapere aude : dff - young researchers grant 10 - 085054 of the danish council for independent research .    mardare would like to thank to prakash panangaden , dexter kozen , chunlai zhou and ernst - erich doberkat for discussions regarding various aspects of the theory of markov processes and logics that eventually allowed us to arrive to the current level of understanding of these problems ."
