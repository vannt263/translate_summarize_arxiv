    "a symmetry , in the field theory , imposed at the classical level sometimes can not survive at the quantum level due to the appearance of anomaly .",
    "it began to be noticed around 1950 by fukuda and miyamoto @xcite and was clearly recognized as the triangle anomaly around 1970 by adler @xcite and bell and jackiw @xcite .",
    "the basic origin at that time was considered as the linear divergence and its regularization ambiguity in a triangle diagram .",
    "the fresh standpoint on the anomaly was brought by fujikawa @xcite around 1980 .",
    "he regarded the anomaly , including the weyl anomaly , as the jacobian in the change of field variable in the path - integral formalism . in the evaluation",
    "fujikawa paid close attention to the definition of the path - integral measure .",
    "he also pointed out the connection with the atiyah - singer theorem .",
    "the anomaly was generalized to gravitational theories in the general dimension by alvarez - gaum and witten @xcite , especially they found the pure gravitational anomaly .",
    "they exploited the knowledge of differential geometry to obtain the explicit form of the chiral u(1 ) anomaly in 2k dim gravitational theories . in",
    "mid 80 s the geometrical aspect of the anomaly was much examined@xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "special emphasis is on the weyl anomaly which is different from other anomalies in the following points .    1",
    ".   weyl anomaly appears in general theories because it is directly related to the trace part of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "it is essentially given by the @xmath0-function , which determines the scaling properties of a theory .",
    "weyl anomaly , at present , does not seem to be understood only by the global geometrical ( topological ) analysis .",
    "this is related to the fact of item 1 .",
    "quantum effect of gauge or gravitational fields is equally important to that of matter fields .",
    "the weyl anomaly is the problem of the real part of the effective action .",
    "therefore we can expect the weyl anomaly contains richer dynamical information than other anomalies .",
    "motivated by this expectation , we newly formulate the general anomaly problem .",
    "it is based on ( the coordinate version of ) the _ propagator approach _ in the ordinary perturbative field theory@xcite .",
    "all explanation is done by the familiar field theory language .",
    "we take the heat - kernel regularization for the ultraviolet divergences .",
    "general formulae of anomalies are obtained .",
    "many applications are presented .",
    "weyl anomalies , chiral anomalies(in the flat and curved space ) , local lorentz anomaly and gravitational anomaly are explicitly derived .",
    "practical usefulness is stressed .",
    "generally anomaly terms ( especially weyl anomaly terms ) , including their coefficients , are fixed by calculating ( 1-loop ) quantum fluctuation in the perturbative expansion .",
    "the explicit calculation becomes more and more complicated as we increase the space(-time ) dimension . in n - dim gravitational theories",
    ", we must treat complicated higher - rank global so(n ) covariants and invariants such as @xmath1  etc . in the weak - gravity expansion : @xmath2 . in order",
    "to get rid of the obstacle , we introduce a graphical representation to treat those terms systematically .",
    "the representation makes it so easy to list up all independent terms . although the present paper deals with @xmath3  and @xmath4  cases only , in order to clearly show the usefulness , it is applicable to higher - dimensional cases .",
    "the anomaly terms are often compared with the counter - terms .",
    "the former is independent of gauge whereas the latter is not .",
    "the former is related with the consistency of the theory whereas the latter is related with the renormalization of the theory .",
    "although both come from the ultra - violet divergences , their most appropriate regularizations are different :  the anomaly terms are commonly calculated by use of pauli - villars regularization ( or its variants ) whereas the counter - terms are usually calculated by use of the dimensional regularization .",
    "we will obtain some direct connection between the two quantities through the anomaly formula calculated by the heat - kernel regularization .",
    "the formula is very powerful as in the case of the counter - term formula by thooft@xcite .",
    "it is demonstrated that various anomalies of various theories are derived by the formulae .",
    "the content is organized as follows . in sec.2",
    "we explain the present formulation of anomaly taking a simple model of the scalar - gravity system in n dimension .",
    "it is based on the propagator theory .",
