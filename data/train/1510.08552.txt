    "as is well known , general relativity ( gr ) is a successful and elegant theory of gravity , but it has many challenges to interpret a growing number of data observed at infrared scales . among them ,",
    "the most famous one is that gr has to introduce additional concepts like dark energy / matter to interpret the observed data about the universe , and this is regarded to be the signal of a breakthrough of gr at astrophysical and cosmology scales  @xcite .",
    "another approach to deal with the problems mentioned above is to introduce the extended theories of gravity ( etg )  @xcite .",
    "these theories are based on generalizations and extensions of gr .",
    "@xmath6 gravity  @xcite is a famous theory which modifies the einstein - hilbert action by adopting a general function of the ricci scalar @xmath3 in the gravitational lagrangian density so as to explain the inflationary behavior with respect to the early universe , as shown by starobinsky  @xcite .",
    "@xmath6 gravity is a typical example of higher order gravity ( hog ) .",

    "this term can avoid ghost contributions and contribute to the regularization of the gravitational action  @xcite .",
    "recently , a new generalized modified the gb gravity , whose lagrangian density is a general function of @xmath3 and @xmath4 as @xmath0 , has attracted considerable attention  @xcite .    in order to test the viability of etg and",
    "parameterize their deviations with respect to gr , we should take into account their weak - field and slow - motion ( wfsm ) limit  @xcite .",
    "etg usually yield corrections to the newton potential and the eddington - parameters which could be a test for these theories  @xcite . in the last few years",
    ", several authors have dealt with the wfsm limit of hog  @xcite .",
    "these papers shed new light on the wfsm limit of such theories .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , capozziello , stabile , and troisi built a new formulism to deal with the newtonian limit of @xmath6 gravity in the spherically symmetric background with the metric approach in the jordan frame . in this formulism , the differential equations at @xmath1 order for @xmath6 gravity are so involuted that corresponding general vacuum solutions are not obtained easily .",
    "in fact , in order to obtain further results , stabile adopted the system of isotropic coordinates  @xcite to study the post - newtonian limit of @xmath6 gravity  @xcite and the newtonian limit of fourth order gravity  @xcite .",
    "in addition , in ref .",
    "@xcite the differential equations of @xmath0 gravity are calculated up to @xmath7 order by using the system of isotropic coordinates , and the solution in the newtonian limit is obtained .    in this paper , we develop the wfsm limit of @xmath0 gravity in spherically symmetric background up to @xmath1 order by generalizing the formalism mentioned above  @xcite . considering the taylor expansion of a general function @xmath2 around vanishing values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , we present general vacuum solutions up to @xmath1 order for @xmath0 gravity in a pure perturbative framework .",
    "these solutions are time - dependent , and the time - dependent evolution depends on the order of perturbations . at @xmath5 order , compared with the conclusions in refs .",
    "@xcite , we find that both @xmath0 gravity and @xmath6 gravity have the same spatial behaviors , namely the yukawa - like behavior and the oscillating - like behavior , and the latter is complex valued and does not meet asymptotic condition in general .",

    "@xcite , the newtonian limit of the most general fourth - order theory of gravity , namely @xmath9 gravity , has been studied , with @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 . according to its conclusions , for the gravitational field generated by a ball - like source , its static yukawa - like behavior has two characteristic lengths @xmath13 and @xmath14 . @xmath15 and @xmath16 are defined as @xmath17 and @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",

    "in addition for such gravitational field , we find that the gravitational potential has the divergency at the position of source , and this conclusion is different from corresponding one of @xmath9 gravity in ref .  @xcite .    at @xmath23 order , although the differential equation is related to the time @xmath24 , we find that the above two behaviors at @xmath5 order meet this equation , so that we can not fix the time - dependent evolution of these two behaviors at this order .",
    "in fact , the differential equations at @xmath1 order still can not solve this problem , and this implies that in order to probe the time - dependent evolution about the behaviors at @xmath5 order , we need to develop the wfsm limit of @xmath0 gravity up to more orders .",
    "the correction to the yukawa - like behavior at @xmath5 order is calculated to @xmath1 order in our paper , and by this correction and previous results , we draw a conclusion : if the gravitational field is generated by a ball - like source , for the submodel of @xmath6 gravity whose term @xmath25 disappears in the taylor expansion of @xmath2 around a vanishing value of @xmath3 , its general vacuum solutions up to @xmath1 order in spherically symmetric background are the same with those in gr . at last , we present the static corrections of such gravitational field to the yukawa - like behavior for @xmath0 gravity , @xmath6 gravity , and the starobinsky gravity  @xcite , and compare them with the one in gr .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec.@xmath26 , we review the equation of @xmath0 gravity . in sec.@xmath26",

    "here we do not discuss the theory on how to formulate a mathematically well founded wfsm limit of some theory about gravity in spherically symmetric background , but we recommend refs .",
    "@xcite to the interested readers .",
    "we provide the explicit form of all the quantities involved in the wfsm limit in spherically symmetric background for @xmath0 gravity .    in the solar system , all the quantities involved in the wfsm formulism can be expanded in powers of @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is planetary average velocities , and is small with respect to the light speed .",

    "the asymptotic cosmology is the de sitter spacetime  @xcite , and then we can assume that it has a small positive constant curvature .",
    "by ( [ 5 ] ) and ( [ 7 ] ) , we know that like @xmath6 gravity  @xcite , the vacuum trace equation admits that @xmath0 gravities has the de sitter spacetime even when the cosmological constant contribution is zero .",
    "therefore , our above assumption is compatible with ( [ 35 ] ) .",
    "now we start to deal with the differential equations at @xmath79 order . by ( [ 20 ] ) , ( [ 29 ] ) , ( [ 31 ] ) , and ( [ 35 ] ) , the differential equations at @xmath79 order are @xmath82 moreover , from the first equality of ( [ 34 ] ) we know that there are only four independent differential equations in ( [ 36 ] ) .",

    ". both ( [ 38 ] ) and ( [ 39 ] ) are time - dependent , and the time - dependent evolution depends on the the order of perturbations .",
    "so like @xmath6 gravity  @xcite , the birkhoff theorem is no longer a general result for @xmath0 gravity .",

    "thus , for these three models above , their spatial behaviors of @xmath149 , @xmath150 , and @xmath151 are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:9][fig:11 ] . from these figures ,",
    "we know that these behaviors are insensitive to the change of @xmath197 which is induced by the cubic term of @xmath3 in the above taylor expansion of @xmath2 , so the dot - dashed curve and dashed curves almost coincide in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] .",
    "the same reason can be used to explain why there are almost only two solid curves in figs .",
    "[ fig:9][fig:11 ] , and there should be four ones in fact .",
    "in addition , these figures show that these behaviors are sensitive to the sign of @xmath198 which is induced by the term of @xmath147 in the above taylor expansion of @xmath2 , so there are two branches for the solid curve .",
    "in this paper , we develop the wfsm limit of @xmath0 gravity in spherically symmetric background up to @xmath36 order by generalizing the formalism in refs .  @xcite . after having considered the taylor expansion of a general function @xmath2 around around vanishing values of @xmath3 and @xmath4",
    ", we obtain general vacuum solutions up to @xmath36 order in a pure perturbative framework .",
    "these solutions are time - dependent , and the time - dependent evolution depends on the order of perturbations . moreover , these solutions depend strictly on the coupling parameters appearing indirectly in the lagrangian of the theory , namely the partial derivatives of @xmath2 at @xmath199 and @xmath200 .    a detailed discussion is developed for these solutions in our paper . compared with the conclusions in refs .",
    "@xcite , the solutions at @xmath79 order show that both @xmath0 gravity and @xmath6 gravity have the same spatial behaviors , namely the yukawa - like behavior and the oscillating - like behavior , and the latter is complex valued and is not asymptotic de sitter spacetime with a small constant curvature in general . moreover , for the gravitational field generated by a ball - like source , we show these two behaviors related to the @xmath8 components provide two kinds of corrected gravitational potentials about the newtonian one . furthermore ,",
    "for such gravitational field we present its two real valued static behaviors and compared them with the one in gr .",
    "the newtonian limit of the most general fourth - order theory of gravity , namely @xmath9 gravity , has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the static yukawa - like behavior has two characteristic lengths for the gravitational field generated by a ball - like source .",
    "however for @xmath0 gravity , our solution at @xmath79 order shows that its static yukawa - like behavior has only one characteristic length .",
    "we show that this is the consequence of the definition of the gb invariant @xmath4 , so our result about the yukawa - like behavior is compatible with the corresponding one in @xmath9 gravity .",
    "in addition , for such gravitational field , we indicate that the gravitational potential has the divergency at the position of source , and this is different from the corresponding conclusion of @xmath9 gravity in ref .",
    "@xcite .    at @xmath80 order ,",
    "we show that although the corresponding differential equation is related to time @xmath24 , it could not fix the time - dependent evolution of the two results at @xmath79 order .",
    "we calculate the correction to the yukawa - like behavior at @xmath79 order up to @xmath36 order , and by this correction and previous results , we draw a conclusion : if the gravitational field is generated by a ball - like source , for the submodel of @xmath6 gravity whose term @xmath25 disappears in the taylor expansion of @xmath2 around a vanishing value of @xmath3 , its general vacuum solutions up to @xmath36 order in spherically symmetric background are the same with those in gr .",
    "at last , we present the static corrections of such gravitational field to the yukawa - like behavior for @xmath0 gravity , @xmath6 gravity , and the starobinsky gravity  @xcite , and compare them with the one in gr .    besides , for @xmath0 gravity , such a class of theory have free parameters which should be fixed by experimental evidence . in ref",
    "@xcite , we know that @xmath6 gravity seems to be a good candidate to explain several data of modern astrophysics and cosmology . taking into account the results presented here , we know the @xmath0 gravity includes the corresponding results for @xmath6 gravity in general , together with additional corrected terms determined by some free parameters .",
    "thus , compared with @xmath6 gravity , @xmath0 gravity might have more freedom to confront with phenomenological data in the future .",
