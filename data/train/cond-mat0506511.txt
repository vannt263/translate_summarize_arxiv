    "several competing o - hole valence configurations were identified .",
    "the near - degeneracy between different hole configurations and the electron ",

    "starting from a minimum - energy geometry where shorter `` chain '' cu  o bonds on a cuo@xmath2 plaquette give rise to a quasi - localized zr like state , a half - breathing motion of the chain oxygens with a phase difference of @xmath79 between adjacent plaquettes ( see fig.3(b ) ) leads to a cuo@xmath2cuo@xmath2 charge transfer of about @xmath74 over an energy barrier of 350 mev ( 175 mev per chain oxygen ) .",

    "o bond length ) . although we did not investigate the effect of further cu ",
    "o@xmath34 distortions , it seems that a whole electron charge moves along the chain when a ... cuo@xmath2 ... @xcite zr like singlet is `` transferred '' to a next nearest neighbor plaquette .",
    "it is possible that at about 1/6-doping an ordered arrangement of hole - free and 1/3-doped stripes is formed within the cuo plane @xcite . under this assumption",
    "our 1-hole , 4-octahedra cluster is related to the unit cell of the charge - ordered 1/3-doped stripe shown in fig.3(a ) ( such a `` unit cell '' actually contains only three in - line octahedra ) .",
    "we speculate then that longer range hole ",
    "hole coulomb interactions associated with cooperative , correlated oxygen - atom displacements like those described in the previous paragraph along a chain of several cu@xmath49o@xmath50cu@xmath51o@xmath52cu@xmath53o@xmath54 units should lower the energy barrier corresponding to the inter - site hole hopping and make possible an ordered , collective motion of the doped holes . under the assumption of an alternating 1/3-doped / hole - free stripe configuration , our results seem to support thus a vibronic mechanism like proposed by goodenough @xcite for the superconductivity in cuprates .",
    "it still needs to be investigated whether ( and why ) nearest neighbor 1-hole correlation bags would `` cluster '' along the chain to form a ( traveling ) cdw with spin - paired 2-hole , 4-cu units separated by two antiferromagnetically - coupled cu @xmath3 ions as suggested in ref.@xcite ( see fig.1(a ) ) .",
    "the longer range interactions responsible for the formation of such paired oxygen holes should be however weaker than those causing the local jt / ct effects we illustrate in fig.4 and tablei .",
    "they probably merely modify the amplitudes of the o - atom displacements that determine the double - well potential .",
    "it should be pointed out at this stage that the casscf results suggest that nearest neighbor oxygen holes have already antiparallel spins , see fig.5 .",
    "obviously , reliable estimates for the strength and the effects of the longer range couplings , intra- and inter - chain , are required for quantitative predictions .",
    "we note that in this model the effect of the inter - chain coulomb interactions should be stronger for cuo multilayer structures like in the mercury compounds and might contribute to a higher @xmath81 .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath81 should be related to thermal fluctuations that disrupt the phase coherence among the kind of o - atom displacements described above . at temperatures well above @xmath81 the striped arrangement",
    "is probably destroyed .",
    "for a certain temperature interval above @xmath81 , the transition from a charge - inhomogeneous phase with parallel chains ( or fragments of chains ) of 1-hole , 3-octahedra units but `` uncorrelated '' bond - length fluctuations to a totally disordered charge configuration could provide an explanation for the @xmath82 transfer of spectral weight in the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) data @xcite .",
    "our [ cu@xmath2o@xmath42 linear cluster seems to be a reasonable choice for studying local correlations for a 1/3-doped chain of octahedra .",
    "the quasi - localized character of the oxygen hole ( see tablei ) justifies such a material model .",
    "this cluster model would probably be inappropriate for the 1/2-doped chain ( or stripe ) in la@xmath83nd@xmath84sr@xmath85cuo@xmath2 @xcite , where the doped - hole orbitals have much larger overlap .",
    "also , although the casscf method can not yield highly accurate energies , such an approach is sufficient for an accurate description of the electron distribution provided the proper active space is chosen .",
    "the near - degeneracy and ct effects illustrated by our casscf results should be then a genuine characteristic of the cuo@xmath2cuo@xmath2 ... chain .",
    "on the other hand , the casscf data normally gives a rather qualitative ( or semi - quantitative ) description for potential - energy landscapes like that associated with the o - atom half - breathing displacements .",
    "a more elaborate treatment , _",
    "e.g. _ multi - reference configuration - interaction or multiconfiguration perturbation theory @xcite , is needed for calculating accurate potential curves and surfaces .",
    "such calculations will be documented in an upcoming publication",
    ".    a matter of concern with our calculations may be the fact that we used experimental structural data",
    ". it would be desirable to start , for example , from a fully optimized structural configuration of the undoped system .",
    "for such an optimized geometry , the in - plane cu ",
    "cu distance would be of particular interest .",
    "it is known that the _ ab initio _ periodic hartree ",
    "fock ( hf ) calculations in the linear - combination of atomic orbitals ( lcao ) formulation slightly overestimate the lattice parameters in transition metal oxides , for example by 2% in mno and nio @xcite and almost 4% in cu@xmath11o @xcite . to reduce these deviations ,",
    "post - hf techniques are needed @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , structure optimizations for complex periodic systems like la@xmath11cuo@xmath2 at a correlated , post - hf level are not possible yet .",
    "intuitively , we expect that for slightly larger cu  cu distances in our cluster the doped hole is somewhat more localized on the distorted cuo@xmath2 plaquette ( see tablei ) . in this case",
    "the half - breathing o - atom vibrations should imply more ct between adjacent plaquettes but over a higher energy barrier .",
