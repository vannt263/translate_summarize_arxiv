    "it holds that the greater the fock number @xmath156 is , the narrower is the corresponding spectral peak and also the closer is the peak to the position of energy of the fano zero ( see fig .  4 ) .",
    "such behavior qualitatively resembles that of an ionization spectrum caused by a classical strong pump field @xcite .",
    "the presence of atom @xmath1 in the quantized pump field considerably modifies the ionization spectra of atom @xmath2 due to the mutual indirect interaction of both atoms through the quantized pump field .",
    "contrary to the spectra of isolated atom @xmath157 , the ionization spectra have contributions both below and above the pump - field frequency .",
    "moreover , the spectral peaks above and below the pump - field frequency occur in pairs which results in nearly symmetric ionization spectra ( see figs .  6 ,  7 ) .",

    "the ionization spectra also gradually lose their peaked structure with the increasing pump - field intensities ( see figs .  10 ,  11 ) .",
    "for sufficiently high pump - field intensities , the spectrum approaches that of the isolated atom @xmath1 .    when the interaction mediated by the quantized field is weaker , the behavior of ionization spectra with the increasing pump - field intensities is qualitatively similar to the usual one discussed in the fano model .",
    "the spectra move towards lower energies with the increasing pump - field intensities and cross at certain intensity the energy of fano zero , as documented in figs .",
    "12 ,  13 .",
    "whereas the isolated atom @xmath2 has a one - peak spectrum , the spectrum of atom @xmath2 influenced by atom @xmath1 consists of two peaks that form a spectral dublet at greater pump - field intensities clearly visible in fig .  13 .",
    "the dipole - dipole interaction between atoms @xmath1 and @xmath2 , in general , splits the peaks in the ionization spectra of isolated atom @xmath2 into two parts ( see figs .",

    "there occur two major peaks in the ionization spectra for greater pump - field intensities .",
    "these spectral peaks are broken into many sub - peaks for low pump - field intensities as a consequence of quantum character of the pump field ( see fig .",
    "individual sub - peaks can be connected with the appropriate fock states , similarly as in the previous section .",
    "two major peaks approach each other with the increasing pump - field intensity and form a spectral dublet at certain moment ( see fig .",
    "if only the dipole - dipole interaction between the discrete level of atom @xmath1 and the continuum of states of atom @xmath2 ( @xmath158 ) is considered , the fano zero of isolated atom @xmath2 is inevitably lost .",

    "( [ 44 ] ) is not fulfilled ( see fig .",
    "such behavior originates in the weakness of dipole - dipole interactions compared to the coulomb and optical dipole interactions that form the fano zero of isolated atom @xmath2 .",

    "it is remarkable that the values of density of negativity are very low for the degenerate energies of qubits inside the continuum of atom @xmath2 ( @xmath171 ) .",
    "this behavior can be explained by the long - time energy conservation that does not allow to entangle such qubits in the continuum with the qubit of atom @xmath172 .",
    "the densities of negativity appropriate to the coherent and fock states completely differ , as demonstrated in figs .  18 ,  19 .",
    "we note that a pump field in the fock state with one photon can not create entanglement due to the energy conservation",

    "behave similarly as those created by the interaction mediated by the quantized field .",
