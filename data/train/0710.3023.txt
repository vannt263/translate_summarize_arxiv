    "convection near the solar surface has a strongly non - local and dynamical character .",
    "hence , numerical simulations provide useful information on the spatial structures resulting from convection and help in constructing consistent models of the physical processes underlying the observed solar phenomena .",
    "we conduct an investigation of the temporal evolution and growth of convective modes on scales of mesogranulation and supergranulation in a three - dimensional computational box . in previous work by the author [ @xcite ] it was shown that collective motion of small convective cells of granulation expels weak magnetic field on the edges of cells at mesogranular scales .",
    "the average size of such cells is 15 - 20 mm and the lifetime of order 8 - 10 solar hours .",
    "simulation of solar photosphere convection [ @xcite ] in a computational domain of size 48 mm in the horizontal plane and 20 mm in depth showed that the sizes of convective cells increase with depth .",
    "the purpose of this work is to investigate the development and scales of convection in a region of size 60 mm in the horizontal plane and 20 mm in depth .",
    "the distribution of the main thermodynamic variables with radius was taken from the standard solar model [ @xcite ] with parameters @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are hydrogen and helium abundances by mass , and @xmath5 is the ratio of mixing length to pressure scale height in the convection region .",
    "we used the opal opacity tables and the equation of state for solar matter [ @xcite ] .",
    "the fully compressible nonideal hydrodynamics equations were solved :    @xmath6    @xmath7 = \\rho \\vec g + \\nabla \\cdot \\hat \\tau\\ ] ]    @xmath8= \\nabla \\cdot \\left(\\vec v \\cdot \\hat \\tau \\right )   + \\rho \\left(\\vec g \\cdot \\vec v \\right ) + q_{rad}\\ ] ]    @xmath9 is the total energy , @xmath10 is the energy transferred by radiation and @xmath11 is the viscous stress tensor .",
    "the influence of small scales on large scale flows was evaluated in terms of the viscous stress tensor and the rate of dissipation was defined from the buoyancy and shear production terms [ @xcite ] .",
    "the evolution of all variables in time was found using an explicit tvd[total variation diminishing ] conservative difference scheme [ @xcite ] : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and the operator @xmath14 is @xmath15 the flux along each direction was defined by the local - characteristic method as @xmath16 \\ .\\ ] ] @xmath17 is the matrix whose columns are right eigenvectors of @xmath18 evaluated as a generalized roe average of @xmath19 and @xmath20 for real gases .",
    "@xmath21 is the matrix of numerical dissipation .",
    "the term @xmath22 represents the effect of gravitational forces and radiation .",
    "time step integration is by third - order runge - kutta method [ @xcite ] .",
    "this scheme is second - order in space and time .",
    "central differences were used for the viscous term , and the diffusion approximation was applied for the radiative term in the energy equation .",
    "we used a uniform grid in the @xmath23 and @xmath24 directions and a nonuniform grid in the vertical @xmath25 direction .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were used in the horizontal directions and the top and bottom boundary conditions were chosen to be @xmath26 that is , reflection for the @xmath27 component of velocity , outflow for the @xmath23 and @xmath24 components . pressure and density were derived from the solution of the hydrostatic equation , using the equation of state with a constant value of the internal energy .",
    "the numerical simulation of solar photosphere convection was conducted during 24 solar hours . on the upper boundary of the region , which corresponds to optical depth @xmath28 near the solar surface in the horizontal plane ,",
    "the development of small - scale convection structure is clearly seen , with cells of average size 1.5 mm and lifetime of order 1 - 2 min ( figure 1 ) . at depth 1",
    "mm from the solar surface we observe the appearance of signs of large - scale convective cells at the scale of mesogranulation ( figure 2 ) . with increasing depth the size of big convective cells grows and their number decreases .",
    "at depth 2 - 5 mm the average size of a cell is 10 - 15 mm , whereas it is 15 - 20 mm at depths greater than 10 mm ( figure 3 - 6 ) .",
    "vertical motion on the edges of convective cells has the maximum values of velocity and become supersonic at cell vertices at depths 3 - 4 mm . in the deepest part of the domain",
    "the flow of material becomes slower and more laminar .    by looking at the convective flow in a vertical plane",
    "we can see three regions , distinctly different in physical character ( figure 7 - 8 ) . in the turbulent zone at depths 0 - 2 mm , small - scale chaotic motion of granules due to",
    "the action of strong compressible effects leads to formation of downdrafts of cold blobs of material .",
    "there are places with strong vorticity motion where material moves from different directions to one point with the formation of more powerful downdrafts . in the transition zone at depths of 2 - 5 mm",
    "we find large - scale flow , on the scales of mesogranulation . here",
    "the downdrafts achieve a maximum velocity , on average , of about 4 km / sec with mach number 1.5 .",
    "material moves downwards in the form of narrow jets and upwards in wider regions with an average of size 10 - 15 mm .",
    "in the third part of the region , at greater depths , we obesrve some points where material reaches the bottom boundary with subsonic velocity .",
    "the distances between these points gives us the size of convective cells on the scale of supergranulation , about 20 mm .",
    "we averaged the velocity components over 4 solar hours for one horizontal plane near the solar surface .",
    "we then introduced many lagrange particles or corks for each cell , uniformly distributed across the plane at some moment of time .",
    "after 4 solar hours of simulation we defined the places with the maximum number of corks . from figure 9",
    "it is clearly seen that large - scale divergent flows from the centers of big convective cells expel corks to their edges .",
    "corks are located in places with converging flows ( figure 9 ) where we have positive values of the two - dimensional divergence of velocity and at points with strong vorticity motion where we find large negative values of curl velocity . as seen from figure 10",
    "there are convective cells with the size of supergranulation - about 20 mm in diameter .",
    "matter move away from the center of these cells with average velocity 1 - 1.5 km / sec .",
