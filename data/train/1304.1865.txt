    "<S> the cycle will repeat indefinitely and is the essence of the se .    </S>",
    "<S> the above arguments are approximate , because the system is never exactly fully synchronized or desynchronized , instead it passes through a continuum of states , each associated to a different fixed point in @xmath50-space . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant aspect is that the fixed points associated to the hs ( ls ) phase are larger than the transition point @xmath102 ( smaller than @xmath104 ) . </S>",
    "<S> as we have verified this is indeed the case , therefore the mechanism is still valid . to perform a direct test of the validity of our analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we have measured the pdf of @xmath38 conditioned to the fact that @xmath50 was increasing ( decreasing ) during an us . from these pdfs </S>",
    "<S> we derived the corresponding free energy profile @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ r_w_locked ] @xmath105 has a unique minimum at @xmath106 , while @xmath107 has an absolute minimum at @xmath108 and a shoulder around @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> these results confirm that the equilibrium attractive values for @xmath50 are located opposite to the transition points , because when the system is in the hs ( ls ) regime the synaptic weights increase ( decrease ) continuously trying to reach the corresponding fixed points .     versus the dc current @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> the shaded area represents the @xmath50-values measured during uss . </S>",
    "<S> the upper black ( lower red ) dashed line refers to the estimated @xmath102 ( @xmath104 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the error bars have been evaluated over 5 different realizations of the constrained simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the upper ( lower ) solid blue line represents the fixed point values @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( inset ) the red circles ( black squares ) refer to the free energy barrier @xmath110 separating the hs ( ls ) state from the saddle . </S>",
    "<S> the blue line is an exponential fit to the hs barrier height . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining parameters as in fig . [ synch ] and @xmath44 , width=241 ]    </S>",
    "<S> the se should be active whenever the transition values @xmath102 and @xmath104 are both contained within the interval @xmath111 $ ] . to verify this statement </S>",
    "<S> we have measured @xmath102 , @xmath104 and the fixed points for various dc currents within the interval @xmath112 ( data shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ w_a ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the transition is hysteretic in the interval @xmath1130;1.40]$ ] , while for larger values @xmath102 and @xmath104 essentially coincide . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , @xmath102 becomes larger than @xmath97 at @xmath114 , while @xmath115 for @xmath116 . </S>",
    "<S> thus we expect that @xmath45 exhibits two coexisting minima , due to the se , when @xmath117 . to verify this conjecture we estimate the free energy barrier heights @xmath110 separating the hs and the ls state from the intermediate saddle for various @xmath41 values . as shown in the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ w_a ] , the barrier associated to the hs state diverges exponentially when approaching @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the hs regime is the only possible at smaller @xmath41-values . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> the two minima merge and the associated barriers vanish for @xmath118 indicating that the ls state is the unique remaining at large @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the distributions of the @xmath50-values measured during uss are reported in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ w_a ] as a shaded area : these values include the transition interval @xmath119 $ ] for @xmath120 .    in conclusion , the se should be observable in pulse coupled neural networks whenever the excitation has a desynchronizing effect . </S>",
    "<S> this is in general verified for any kind of neuronal response ( type i or type ii ) for sufficiently slow synaptic interactions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we have verified that the se persists by setting @xmath121 , as suggested by experimental evidences  @xcite .    </S>",
