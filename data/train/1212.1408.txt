    "this deviation is temperature dependent,@xcite leading to a variation of @xmath14 from 60  at 10k to 78 at 310k . above the spin - flip temperature @xmath15=123k , the spin waves are transverse with the spin @xmath16 perpendicular to @xmath17 .",
    "contrary to what happens in single crystals in which all three crystallographic directions are equivalent , in thin cr films@xcite the wave vector @xmath17 orients perpendicular to the film surface as its thickness decreases@xcite , and the isdw s are transverse for all temperatures@xcite below @xmath7 .",
    "this confinement of the isdw leads to the quantization of the wave vector @xmath18 , with @xmath4 an integer , giving rise to very interesting hysteretic phenomena .",
    "fullerton et al.@xcite measured neutron scattering and electrical transport in cr / cr@xmath19mn@xmath20 ( 001 ) superlattices , where the crmn layers , being antiferromagnetic with a higher @xmath21 , exert some stringent boundary conditions on the cr surfaces .",
    "they found that temperature cycling produced irreversibility in the derivative of the resistivity and in the neutron scattering scans .",
    "these features were attributed to a change in an odd number of nodes in the isdw inside the cr layers which is compatible with the magnetic coupling at the interfaces with the crmn layers .",
    "recently , kummamuru et al.@xcite reported on transport results in epitaxially grown cr ( 100 ) thin films of different thicknesses . here",
    "the boundary conditions are different from those in the superlattices of fullerton et al . however , they found thermal hysteretic behavior of the hall coefficient and resistivity for thicknesses below 510 .",
    "they interpreted these results in terms of isdw domains with @xmath4 nodes ( at high temperatures ) or @xmath4 + 1 nodes ( at low temperatures ) in the cr film . for thicker films ( 3500 )",
    "this mechanism disappears , and only an irreversibility in the @xmath22 curves was seen in a wider temperature range , and explained in terms of domain - wall scattering of electrons .",
    "if hysteretic phenomena are indeed related to a first order phase transition taking place between domains of isdw s with @xmath4 and @xmath4 + 1 nodes inside the cr layers , it is natural to ask how the transition temperature depends on the cr thickness . since for thicker films the number of available modes for the isdw increases in the whole temperature range where @xmath23 changes",
    ", one would naively expect to find the hysteretic behavior at higher temperatures in the thicker films . in this article",
    "we address these issues both experimentally and theoretically , and demonstrate that exactly the opposite behavior is found , i.e. the hysteretic region and the transition temperature move towards lower temperatures as the film thickness is increased .",
    "we therefore believe that this work throws new light on the understanding of the behavior of isdws in confined geometries .",
    "cr thin films were grown epitaxially on mgo ( 100 ) substrates using dc magnetron sputtering in a similar way as that reported by kummamuru et al .. @xcite the films , with thicknesses between 270 and 1100 , were characterized by x - ray diffraction showing rocking curves that have an angular dispersion at fwhm around the [ 002 ] peak of @xmath24 , indicating a very good degree of epitaxy .",
    "results from afm scans show a mean surface roughness of about 20 , which is the third part of @xmath14 at low temperatures .",
    "all films were patterned using photolithography and chemical etching in a convenient configuration to perform four terminal measurements of the resistance .",
    "it was measured as a function of @xmath1 between 15 and 340k in a commercial cryo - cooler .",
    "the error in the resistance measurement was 1/10000 , almost independent of @xmath1 .",

    "let us look more in detail the quantization of the isdw in thin films , which is important to understand the hysteresis of the resistivity in cooling - warming cycles .    as a product of different internal interactions",
    ", @xmath12 depends on temperature.@xcite it varies quite linearly from , @xmath12=0.0379 at @xmath1=300k , to @xmath12=0.044 at @xmath1=200k . as a direct consequence , @xmath14 changes from 76 to 65.5 in the same temperature range . at much lower temperatures it saturates to a constant value @xmath37=0.048 giving @xmath14@xmath3860 .",
    "since the magnetic instability in the electron system depends on the combination @xmath39 , it is clear that the resulting beating has a fast variation modulated by a long wavelength @xmath40 .",
    "thus , the isdw in cr has a wavelength @xmath41        when the isdw is confined in cr films with non - magnetic interfaces , as is the case in our cr films , we expect a configuration with antinodes ( or nodes)@xcite at the films surfaces . for this case , the available modes are separated by half a wavelength . given a film with thickness @xmath5 ,",
    "the allowed values for @xmath42 are therefore @xmath43 , where @xmath4 is either the number of nodes inside the film ( antinodes at the surfaces ) , or antinodes in the film ( nodes at the surface ) .    in the window of wavelength values found in bulk chromium given by @xmath44 ( 60 to 78 )",
    ", there are only a few modes available for each film thickness .",
    "their number increases as @xmath5 increases .",
    "this is shown in fig.[mod3 ] where we plot the allowed modes for each film thickness .",
    "the lines correspond to @xmath45 as calculated from equation [ lambda ] , using a linear approximation for @xmath46 between 200k and 300k , obtained from the data in ref.@xcite .",
    "this approximation seems reasonable because in the thickness range in which our samples lay ( 270 - 1100 ) we do not see appreciable variations of the nel temperature , indicating that there is no strong dependence of @xmath12 with thickness.@xcite    as can be seen in fig.[mod3 ] , in the the film@xcite of 175 , the transition occurs between n=4 and n=5 at the temperature where the line corresponding to @xmath47 .",
    "correspondingly , for the 270 film the transition between n=7 and n=8 lies at a lower temperature . from this",
    ", it seems that the transition temperature would decrease with @xmath5 .",
    "this reasoning , however , can not be extended to the other film thicknesses based on the information displayed in fig.[mod3 ] alone , because more modes than one become available for the isdw , and there is no way to choose _ a priori _ at which one the transition would occur . in order to understand how the transition temperature depends on @xmath5 , in section [ model ]",
    "we propose a phenomenological model which takes into account this variation of the number of permitted modes when @xmath5 increases , and we also incorporate some dynamics .",
    "when the temperature is decreased below @xmath7 , the wavelength of the isdw in the cr film would try to follow it s bulk behavior.@xcite however , as discussed in the previous section : the isdw is confined in a film of a given thickness , the variation in temperature of @xmath14 is quantized , and the number of nodes varies discontinuously from @xmath4 to @xmath4 + 1 , in a process that involves a first order phase transition .",
    "neutron diffraction@xcite as well as x - ray experiments@xcite confirm this physical picture in cr / crmn multilayers and in cr thin films respectively .",
    "let us consider a one - dimensional model of a transverse isdw with @xmath17=@xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the direction perpendicular to the film s surface .",
    "in this case the order parameter takes the form @xmath50=@xmath51 .",
    "we can then write an expression for the free energy ( per unit length ) depending on @xmath52 and @xmath53 ,    @xmath54 & = & f_0 + a(t - t^{bulk}_n)|\\psi|^2 + b|\\psi|^4 \\nonumber\\\\ & + & c|(\\nabla - iq_0)\\psi |^2 + u_{surface } ,   \\label{free_en}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath55 is the part of the free energy which is independent of the isdw , @xmath56=311k and @xmath57 is the wave vector that the isdw would have in the bulk material .",
    "following mcmillan@xcite we include the term @xmath58 which gives a contribution proportional to @xmath59 .",
    "this takes into account the fact that there exists an energy cost in order to deform the isdw with respect to it s bulk form .",
    "the key point is that @xmath57 varies in temperature and these variations should be followed by the isdw in order to keep the energy at a minimum .",
    "there is , nevertheless , a competition between the energy paid to deform the isdw respect to the bulk , and the energy cost for not satisfying the boundary conditions imposed by the surface .",
    "as already mentioned , the most natural way to choose these boundary conditions for cr films that are not in contact with magnetic materials is to have nodes or antinodes at the surfaces . for both cases @xmath60 , i.e. @xmath61 . considering this ,",
    "the surface contribution to the free energy is given by a term proportional to @xmath62 .",
    "the way to account for the different possible available modes @xmath63 is simply by selecting the one that gives the lowest contribution to the free energy at a given temperature ( see fig.[mod3 ] ) .",
    "then , we explicitly have for the free energy ,    @xmath54 & = & f_0 + a(t - t^{bulk}_n)\\psi_0 ^ 2 + b \\psi_0 ^4 \\nonumber\\\\ & + & c(q - q_0)^2 \\psi_0 ^2 + u\\min_{\\{k_n\\}}[(q - k_n)^2\\psi_0 ^ 2 ] .",

    "this is shown in fig.[mod4 ] for a fixed amplitude of the order parameter @xmath52 and adequate numeric parameters .",
    "note the change in the potential landscape with temperature .",
    "as @xmath1 is decreased the barriers between modes increase and the free energy changes in such a way to give preference to the modes with higher @xmath53 s , i.e. shorter wavelengths and more nodes ( antinodes ) in the isdw .    in this simple way",
    "we can understand how the isdw s wavelength is jumping from @xmath4 to @xmath4 + 1 nodes and so on as the temperature decreases .",

    ", we introduce some dynamics by means of a monte - carlo simulation of the system . here",
    "we have a two dimensional phase space @xmath70 and an energy given by eq.[free_en2 ] .",
    "the resulting average value of @xmath53 after several runs is shown in fig.[mod5 ] for different film thickness as the temperature is decreased . at high temperatures , the system explores all possible @xmath65 s for each @xmath5 , but as the temperature is lowered , the isdw chooses only one @xmath65 and stays there no matter how low the temperature goes .",
    "this behavior defines a freezing temperature that we identify with @xmath3 .",
    "the values obtained from the results in fig.[mod5 ] for the freezing temperature corresponding to each film thickness , are plotted in fig.[mod6 ] .",
    "clearly , the freezing temperature follows the same trend as the experimental data for @xmath71 , i.e. , it goes down as the film thickness is increased .",
    "the saturation seen in the transition temperature in our data for @xmath5 s larger than 750 naturally occurs in our monte - carlo simulations if we put , mimicking the experimental results,@xcite a constant @xmath46 at low temperatures . with this simple phenomenological model",
    "we do not pretend to get a quantitative agreement with our experimental data , but it is important to understand the physics behind the observed hysteretic phenomena .",
    "we have shown that the hysteretic behavior that appears in @xmath22 in epitaxial cr thin films is a consequence of the quantization of a transverse incommensurate spin density wave in the direction perpendicular to the film surfaces , with a first order phase transition occurring between domains with @xmath4 and @xmath4 + 1 nodes ( or antinodes ) .",
    "the number @xmath4 at which the transition manifests is film thickness dependent , being larger for thicker films .",
    "an analysis of the one dimensional isdw free energy , estimated using mcmillan s approach for cdw s , together with some dynamics introduced via monte - carlo simulations , show that the potential barriers between allowed modes increases as the system is cooled down . as a consequence of this , and for each @xmath5 , at high temperatures the system explores all available modes but remains frozen in a high @xmath65 state at low enough temperatures .",
    "therefore , this simple phenomenological model explains in a natural way the experimental results which show that the temperature at which the transition between @xmath4 and @xmath4 + 1 modes takes place , decreases as the film thickness is increased .",
