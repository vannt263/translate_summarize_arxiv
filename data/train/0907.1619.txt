    "the confinement of the order parameter fluctuations in a critical fluid leads to an effective long - ranged interaction between the confining walls and colloidal particles suspended in the fluid .",
    "the occurrence of such a force was predicted by @xcite in @xcite @xcite . it is called critical ( or thermodynamic ) casimir force @xcite , in analogy with the casimir force @xcite in quantum electrodynamics where the force originates from the confined quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field @xcite .    since",
    "then the critical casimir effect has attracted increasing theoretical and experimental attention . so far",
    "the theoretical investigations of the critical casimir effect have been focused on the film geometry , realized either by homogeneous , planar , and parallel walls ( see , e.g. , refs . @xcite and references therein ) or by chemically patterned @xcite or geometrically structured substrates @xcite , as well as on spherical colloidal particles ( see , e.g. , refs . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "strong experimental evidences for critical casimir forces have been obtained by studying wetting films near critical end points of quantum @xcite or classical fluids @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out by @xcite @xcite that such fluctuation - induced forces should lead to flocculation of colloidal particles if their solvent is a binary liquid mixture close to its consolute point .",
    "such a solvent - mediated flocculation , which can be interpreted as indirect evidence for the critical casimir force , has indeed been observed for silica spheres suspended in a binary liquid mixture of water and lutidine @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) as well as in other binary mixtures @xcite .",
    "however , only recently , the first _ direct _ experimental evidence of the critical casimir force has been reported concerning the force between a spherical colloidal particle and a homogeneous @xcite or chemically patterned @xcite wall .    in the present study",
    "we analyze the critical casimir effect for non - spherical colloidal particles . in this case",
    ", there is not only a force acting between particles or between a particle and a wall but there is also a _ torque _ exerted on the particle .",
    "this may lead to interesting effects such as orientational ordering of non - spherical colloids in a critical solvent or anchoring of non - spherical particles at a wall . by varying the temperature",
    "the strength of this orientational interaction can be tuned and by changing chemically the preferences of the surfaces for the two species forming the solvent one can choose the sign of the interaction @xcite .",
    "motivated by this prospect we therefore extend our previous study of critical adsorption at a single non - spherical colloidal particle @xcite to the case that in addition there is a planar wall present .",
    "this kind of orientation dependence of fluctuation  induced forces has recently been studied for quantum mechanical casimir forces @xcite .",
    "as far as torque due to critical fluctuations is concerned , in ref .  @xcite the critical casimir torque on the confining walls of a wedge has been analyzed .",
    "based on field - theoretic techniques the interaction of non - spherical particles , embedded into a solution of long polymers , with a planar wall has been investigated in the limiting case that the size of the particle is much smaller than the distance from the wall ( `` protein limit '' ) and which , in turn , is assumed to be much smaller than the correlation length @xcite .",
    "these latter analyses show , in particular , that for a solution of ideal polymer chains the preferred orientation of the elongated colloidal particle changes from being perpendicular to being parallel to the substrate surface upon decreasing the particle ",
    "wall distance @xcite , whereas in a solvent of self - avoiding chains the preferred orientation is the parallel one for all distances @xcite .",
    "the theoretical interest in the behavior of non - spherical colloidal particles is matched by an increased experimental interest , even with application perspectives @xcite .",
    "rodlike @xcite or disklike @xcite architectures , dumbbell - shaped particles @xcite , and particles with ellipsoidal shape @xcite have been synthesized and characterized .",
    "the size of these particles ranges between 10 nm and 10 @xmath0 m .",
    "very recently the influence of an effective torque exerted by a non - critical one - component solvent on dumbbell - shaped particles has been revealed using depolarized light scattering @xcite .",
    "for this system , it has been demonstrated that the addition of small amounts of electrolyte has a significant impact on the rotational motion and the aggregation stability of these non - spherical particles , while changes of the temperature typically result in only minor changes of the effective interaction between colloidal particles because this solvent is not close to a continuous phase transition .",
    "however , as stated above , near a critical point the effective interaction is expected to exhibit a very sensitive temperature dependence .",

    "two common choices are used to define the distance between the particle and the wall : the surface - to - surface distance @xmath4 ( used , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite ) and the distance @xmath5 from the center of the particle to the wall ( used , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] .",
    "correspondingly , one can also define two different pivots ( points of rotation ) with respect to which the particle rotates : the point on the surface of the particle closest to the wall ( denoted by a circle in fig .",

    "while it is obvious that the force does not depend on the definition of the distance , the torque does depend on the choice of the pivot .",

    "the semi - axes \\{@xmath77 } of the hypercylinder ( see fig .  [",

    "as we have already mentioned , one can introduce different pivots with respect to which the torque is exerted on the ellipsoid , such as the point of closest approach to the wall ( denoted as a circle in fig .",

    "the latter is more convenient to use if the ellipsoid is far from the substrate . in this case",
    "the motion of the ellipsoid can be described in terms of its center of mass ( which we assume to coincide with the geometrical center ) ; accordingly the orientational degrees of freedom of the ellipsoid should consistently be described also with respect to the center of the ellipsoid .",

    "note that the scaling function is negative in the former and positive in the latter case .",
    "this means that if the surface - to - surface distance @xmath4 is kept fixed ( for instance , by optical tweezers or by the wall ) , the optimal configuration of an ellipsoidal colloid is to be parallel to the wall ( @xmath154 ) .",

    "i not all orientations of the prolate ellipsoid are allowed because the particle can not penetrate the wall . in the case of an attractive critical casimir interaction the prolate ellipsoid reaches its most favorable configuration of lying parallel to the wall by tilting such that for a prescribed distance of its center from the wall its optimum angle in region i is the one for which it is in touch with the wall ( fig .",

    "the preferred orientation in region ii is perpendicular @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : orientations](b ) ) and parallel @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : orientations](c ) ) to the wall , respectively . upon further increasing the distance from the wall",
    "a change of the preferred orientation has been found in the case of a scalar model of quantum - electrodynamics with neumann boundary conditions both at the surface of the particle and at the wall @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : orientations](b ) ) and in the case of ideal polymers acting as depletion agents @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : orientations](c ) ) .",
    "the polymer induced depletion interaction has been calculated @xcite in the so - called protein limit in which the size of the ellipsoid is small compared to the polymer size characterized by the radius of gyration . by using the small particle operator expansion , it has been shown that the extension of region ii along the @xmath107-direction is given by the radius of gyration of the polymers acting as depletion agents @xcite .",

    "we emphasize that the preferred orientations of a prolate ellipsoid due to the quantum - electrodynamic casimir interaction ( fig .",
    "[ fig : orientations](b ) ) have been obtained by considering a _ scalar _ model instead of the actual vectorial electromagnetism . in the actual case of the electromagnetic field , which implies dirichlet boundary conditions , and a slightly deformed sphere , the preferred orientation of a prolate ellipsoid is the one perpendicular to the wall in both regions ii and iii @xcite .",
    "future work in this area may focus on the understanding of the influence of the quantum - electrodynamic casimir interaction on ellipsoids of arbitrary eccentricities and at small distances from the wall .",

    "fig : force : distance_comp ] and [ fig : force : distance ] ) .",
    "the strength of the force depends on the orientation of the colloidal particle relative to the wall : for elongated colloids it is stronger if the colloid is oriented parallel to the wall at the same surface - to - surface distance @xmath4 ( see figs .  [",

    "if ellipsoidal colloids are oriented perpendicular to the wall , the force is stronger for shorter colloids ( see fig .  [",

    "we note , however , that the latter effect is due to the specific shape of the ellipsoid at its elongated edge ( see subsec .",
    "[ sec : mf : force ] ) , while the former effect is more general .",
    "the sign of the universal torque scaling function @xmath241 depends on the boundary conditions and on the pivot with respect to which the particle rotates .",
    "thus , if the pivot is chosen to be the point on the particle surface closest to the wall ( denoted as a circle in fig .
