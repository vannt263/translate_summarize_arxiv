    "real - space condensation occurs in models of mass transport when the globally conserved mass exceeds a critical value ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite for reviews ) . in this regime ,",
    "the excess mass forms a condensate which is localised in space , for example at a single lattice site , and coexists with a background fluid in which the remaining mass is evenly distributed over the rest of the system . the condensation phenomenon occurs in many physical contexts such as coalescence in granular systems @xcite , jamming in traffic @xcite , aggregation and absorption on surfaces @xcite , emulsification failure in polydisperse hard - sphere systems @xcite , etc . in these examples",
    "the ` mass ' corresponds to some conserved quantity such as the total number of particles , the total length of gaps between the cars or the volume fraction of hard spheres , respectively .",
    "a particularly convenient case for analysing the condensation phenomenon is when the system has a factorised stationary state meaning that the stationary state probability of observing a configuration of masses @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the site index , is @xmath2\\delta\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^l m_j - m\\right)\\;.\\ ] ] here @xmath3 is the normalisation constant or nonequilibrium partition function ; @xmath4 is the single - site weight , and the delta function ensures that the total mass @xmath5 in the system is fixed to take value @xmath6 .",
    "thus the masses @xmath7 are uncorrelated except through this global constraint .",
    "a well - known model where the stationary state is given by ( [ fss ] ) is the zero - range process in which @xmath7 is integer valued and the dynamics is such that one unit of mass moves from site @xmath8 to a neighbouring site with rate @xmath9 which depends on the mass @xmath7 at the departure site .",
    "then it may be shown that the single - site weight is given by @xmath10 , and by choosing different hopping rates @xmath11 one obtains different forms for @xmath12 .",
    "other models with more complicated hopping rates also share a factorised stationary state @xcite and exhibit condensation .",
    "however , it should be stressed that factorisation is not a pre - requisite for condensation .",
    "more generally , models with continuous mass variables having factorised stationary states may be constructed @xcite . in any case , for both discrete and continuous masses , the condensation occurs when @xmath12 decays slower than an exponential in @xmath13 . ) any exponential factor @xmath14 in @xmath12 is immaterial as it results in a constant factor @xmath15 in the numerator which will be cancelled by a corresponding factor in @xmath3 .",
    "thus the condition for condensation can be extended to @xmath12 having the form @xmath16 , provided @xmath17 decays slower than an exponential . ]",
    "the condition for condensation of continuous masses may be written in terms of the mass density @xmath18 as @xmath19 from ( [ cond ] ) one sees that @xmath20 when @xmath21 for example , a stretched exponential @xmath22 with @xmath23 or a power law @xmath24 with @xmath25 fulfils ( [ ld ] ) .",
    "the ensuing condensation which occurs will be referred to as _ standard _ condensation .",
    "a clear signature of standard condensation is exhibited in the marginal distribution for the single - site mass which may be expressed as @xmath26 in the condensed phase this distribution has a bump around the excess mass @xmath27 as computed in@xcite .",
    "more rigorous work on standard condensation can be found in @xcite .    as an aside",
    "we note that there are other variants of condensation such as strong condensation , which occurs for any mass density ( i.e. @xmath28 ) when @xmath12 increases with @xmath13 more quickly than exponentially @xcite , and bose - einstein condensation which may occur when the hopping rate @xmath9 depends on the site , leading to inhomogeneous weights @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "also a different form of condensation is exhibited in the inclusion process in the limit of certain rates tending to zero @xcite .",
    "recently it has been appreciated that the condensation phenomenon , at least in the context of factorised stationary states , is related to large deviations of sums of random variables @xcite . to see this we consider the normalisation in ( [ fss ] ) @xmath30 \\delta\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{l}m_j - m\\right)\\;.\\ ] ] if we can normalise the single - site weight @xmath12 so that @xmath31 , then @xmath32 in ( [ fss ] ) is equivalent to the probability density of picking @xmath33 independent and identically distributed ( iid ) random variables with a common probability density @xmath12 , conditioned on the fixed value of their sample sum @xmath34 . by fixing @xmath35 to take value @xmath6 that is far from the mean @xmath36 , where ( provided it exists ) @xmath37 is the average of @xmath13 with respect to a heavy - tailed @xmath12 , we can explore a regime where random variables are conditioned on the large deviation of @xmath35 and employ results from large deviation theory .",
    "large deviation theory is concerned with the probability for events that are far away from the mean ; the theory often predicts that the probability for such rare events is @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is deviation from the mean ; here , @xmath33 is called the speed of convergence and @xmath40 is the rate function .",
    "the mathematical theory of large deviations was first developed by cramr in the 1930s for sums of iid random variables ; it was later extended to correlated random variables resulting in the grtner - ellis theorem which connects the cumulant generating function for the random variables to the rate function @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "the theory of large deviations has taken a prominent role in nonequilibrium statistical physics ( for an overview , see @xcite ) .",
    "for example , the nonequivalence of microcanonical and canonical ensembles , characteristic of many systems with long - range interactions , is signalled by non - convexity of the rate function @xcite ; in the context of condensation a similar nonequivalence of ensembles has been studied in @xcite .",
    "more generally , nonanalytic behaviour of @xmath40 signals a nonequilibrium phase transition @xcite .",
    "recently , large deviation theory has been developed for stochastic systems of interacting particles such as the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) , for the statistics of both the stationary @xcite and time - dependent variables @xcite .",
    "exact results from the asep were later also the main contributing factor in developing general theory for driven diffusive systems called the macroscopic fluctuation theory @xcite that uses large deviation theory extensively .    a particularly striking result from large deviation theory concerns sums of iid random variables where @xmath12 decays slower than an exponential @xcite ; such distributions are called heavy - tailed . in the large deviation regime , such that @xmath41 , where @xmath37 is the average of @xmath13 with respect to a heavy - tailed @xmath12 , one of the random variables typically takes a large value of @xmath42 while the other @xmath43 take values of @xmath44 .",
    "the condition @xmath41 is precisely the condition for condensation ( [ cond ] ) with critical mass density @xmath45 , provided we can relate single - site weight @xmath12 to a probability density by a suitable normalisation .",
    "this distinctive feature of sums of heavy - tailed independent and identically distributed ( iid ) random variables is of main interest e.g. in financial modelling , in particular in risk theory , where condensation is a rare , but catastrophic event @xcite .    in a previous communication @xcite",
    ", we reported that the condensation transition may be observed even when @xmath12 is not heavy - tailed ( henceforth termed light - tailed ) .",
    "the idea in @xcite was to introduce , in addition to fixing @xmath35 , another global constraint by fixing the linear statistic @xmath46 when this constraint is imposed , the light - tailed @xmath12 may effectively become heavy - tailed allowing the standard , single - site , condensation transition to occur . a natural case to consider is @xmath47 ,",
    "from which @xmath48 is the sample variance .",
    "we demonstrated how the condensation transition arises for the simplest case when @xmath12 is an exponential distribution and for @xmath47 ; we also discussed briefly other @xmath12 and general @xmath49 .",
    "a particularly interesting case is when @xmath12 is itself heavy - tailed , because the additional constraint in that case suppresses the condensation in the regime where it would have normally occurred with just @xmath35 fixed .    in this paper , we extend our work in @xcite in several ways .",
    "first , we provide alternative computations for general @xmath49 of the partition function in the presence of two constraints , @xmath50 , which is given by @xmath51 \\delta\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{l}m_j - m\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times\\delta\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{l } m_{k}^{1/p}-v\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] second , we compute the marginal distribution @xmath52 , which is defined as @xmath53\\delta\\left(m_{l-1}-m+m\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times\\delta\\left(v_{l-1}-v+m^{1/p}\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & = & f(m)\\frac{z_{l-1}(m - m , v - m^{1/p})}{z_l(m , v ) } , \\label{marginal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which should reveal a bump corresponding to the condensate in the condensed regime @xcite .",
    "we show that the condensate bump is shifted from the expected occupation number .",
    "we also provide numerical simulations in the case @xmath47 to support our calculations .",
    "finally we discuss in detail some specific physical models that result in the constrained condensation phenomenon .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organised as follows .",
    "our main results are presented in section [ main ] , in particular the phase diagram in @xmath54 plane , which are then analysed in detail in section [ analysis ] . in section [ mc ] we present numerical simulations for the case",
    "@xmath47 that confirm our theoretical predictions . in section [ examples ] , we review several examples of condensation transition : jamming transition in exclusion process , condensation transition in polydisperse rods diffusing on a ring @xcite and phase transition in a random pure state of a large bipartite quantum system @xcite .",
    "we also mention a possibly related phenomenon of localised solutions ( breathers ) of the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "we split our presentation of the main results in two cases , depending on whether the parameter @xmath49 in ( [ vdef ] ) takes values @xmath55 or @xmath56 .",
    "our main focus will be on the case @xmath55 ; the latter can be obtained from the former by making a suitable change of @xmath12 , as explained in section [ case_p_1 ] .",
    "we consider @xmath33 real and non - negative iid random variables @xmath7 , @xmath57 with common probability density @xmath12 , which are further conditioned on the fixed value of @xmath58 and @xmath59 , where @xmath55 .",
    "the probability density of finding a particular configuration @xmath60 for the given values of @xmath6 and @xmath61 reads @xmath62\\delta\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{l}m_j - m\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times\\delta\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{l}m_{k}^{1/p}-v\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the normalisation constant defined in ( [ zmv ] ) .",
    "the probability density @xmath63 in ( [ pmv ] ) corresponds to a factorised steady state of a process whose dynamics conserve both @xmath35 and @xmath64 .",
    "alternatively , we can consider a standard mass - transfer model that only conserves @xmath35 , and ask what is the probability distribution for @xmath64 given fixed @xmath65 .",
    "in that case we are interested in the conditional probability density @xmath66 , which is given by @xmath67 where @xmath3 is given by ( [ zm ] ) .",
    "notice that both @xmath50 and @xmath3 have a simple probabilistic interpretations as discussed in the introduction .",
    "namely , if we consider @xmath7 as iid random variables with common probability density @xmath12 , then @xmath50 is the joint probability density for random variables @xmath35 and @xmath64 ; similarly , @xmath3 is the probability density for @xmath35 .    throughout the paper",
    "we assume that both @xmath6 and @xmath61 are large and proportional to @xmath33 , so that we can write @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath12 has finite moments @xmath70 generally , we are interested in @xmath71 and @xmath72 , which means that @xmath35 and @xmath64 are far from their typical values @xmath36 and @xmath73 , respectively .    our main result concerns the phase diagram in the @xmath74 plane , where phases differ in the behaviour of @xmath50 in the large-@xmath33 limit .",
    "depending on the tail of @xmath12 , we find three qualitatively different cases , which are presented below .",
    "notice also that in all cases we have the hard constraint @xmath75 which follows from jensen s inequality : @xmath76 when @xmath77 is a convex function .",
    "* case ( i ) .",

[ fig1](a ) ) .",
    "we will show later that ( [ zmv_ld_1 ] ) is a typical result from standard large deviation theory , and implies that large deviations of @xmath6 and @xmath61 are `` democratically '' spread across all random variables .",
    "this is more evident if we calculate the marginal distribution ( [ marginal ] ) , which we find takes the form @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the normalisation .",

    "( [ jpdf1 ] ) , the eigenvalues , apart from the global constraint of having their sum to be unity , also have explicit pairwise - interaction through the vandermonde term @xmath463 . in spite of this difference , a condensation transition was found to occur in the distribution of @xmath464 when @xmath459 exceeds a critical value  @xcite . in this case ,",
    "the largest eigenvalue @xmath465 becomes much larger than the rest of the @xmath466 eigenvalues .",
    "for the special case @xmath467 , the same transition was also found in ref .",
    "it turns out that due to the presence of pairwise interaction between the eigenvalues , the speed of the convergence ( with size @xmath33 ) of the large deviation probability @xmath464 is however different in this problem  @xcite compared to the simple noninteracting mass transport models studied in the present paper .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that the presence of two hard constraints can drive a condensation transition remains robust even in presence of pairwise interactions .",
    "it is known that in the discrete non - linear schrdinger equation ( dnlse ) localised ` breather ' solutions are exhibited .",
    "such structures emerge when the energy is raised above some critical value @xcite .",
    "breathers are essentially non - linear oscillators and are thought to be generated in the solution in order to satisfy the dual constraints of conserved norm of the wavefunction and energy .",
    "the statics and dynamics of the breathers has been studied extensively @xcite .",
    "the presence of two constraints in the dnlse is reminiscent of the problem studied in this work .",
    "however the presence of phase dynamics of the wavefunction makes the dnlse a more complicated problem .",
    "recently a simplified model , intended to capture entropic effects and ignoring the phase dynamics was suggested by iubini , politi and politi @xcite .",
    "they replaced the deterministic dnlse with a probabilisitc dynamics that essentially is a realisation of the two constraint problem studied here in the case @xmath47 .",
    "in this work we have studied how two global constraints in the form of linear statistics ( [ vdef ] ) can produce condensation in factorised stationary states .",
    "our results show that condensation may occur when the underlying single site weight @xmath12 is light tailed in contrast to the standard condensation involving only one constraint which requires heavy - tailed @xmath12 .",
    "unexpectedly , we find that for a heavy - tailed choice of @xmath12 the standard condensation may be suppressed by the second constraint",
    ".    we have studied in detail the partition function @xmath50 and the marginal distribution @xmath52 . in the condensation regime , the marginal distribution displays a bump , which turns out to be non - gaussian in @xmath13 ( the bump , in fact , originates from a multivariate gaussian due to the interplay between the two statistics ) . moreover ,",
    "the peak is shifted from the naively expected value of @xmath13 .",
    "we have confirmed our predictions through monte carlo simulations performed using the algorithm of @xcite for the case @xmath47 which corresponds to a constrained sample variance .    to calculate the marginal distribution we used the equivalence between factorised steady states and sums of iid random variables . for the latter",
    "there is a well developed large deviation theory which can be used to describe the fluid phase .",
    "however , the theory does not apply in the condensed regime where the relevant moment - generating function does not exist .",
    "we find that in this regime the large deviation speed has a different scaling to the usual @xmath33 dependence in the fluid phase , see ( [ zcond ] ) .",
    "we have derived the critical line and consequent phase diagrams using the saddle point method and alternatively by using the grtner - ellis theorem which provides a rigorous confirmation of our results .",
    "the derivation of our results for the partition function in section [ analysis ] involved some justifiable approximation that we believe could be made rigorous .",
    "our derivation of the marginal distribution on the other hand used an heuristic argument that the random variables @xmath7 in the background fluid could be treated as independent . for the case of a single constraint",
    "such a result has been proven rigorously @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that our constraint - driven condensation scenario bears some resemblance to condensation previously observed in interacting particle systems with two species of particles @xcite .",
    "there both particle species have conserved number of particles , and the dynamics of one species is dependent on the local distribution of the other species . if the interaction between species is attractive , there is a phase in which the condensate of one of the particle species ( of size @xmath468 ) co - exists with a `` weak '' condensate of particles of the other species ( of size @xmath469 ) at the same site , similar to our problem for @xmath47 .",
    "finally , the large deviation framework allows us to view the problem not necessarily as one of two constraints but rather as realisation of a rare fluctuation @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been increasing interest in identifying the structure of rare but important fluctuations in non - equilibrium systems revealing fluctuations that have interesting co - operative structure @xcite .",
    "our results add to that context by providing an example of a rare fluctuation exhibiting a higher level of organisation and a broken symmetry in the sense that one random variable dominates .    as an outlook for future work ,",
    "we mention that other choices for linear statistic @xmath64 could also give rise to the condensation . recently , condensation was observed in joint statistics of sums @xmath470 and @xmath471 @xcite , where @xmath462 s are correlated random variables having similar pairwise interaction as in ( [ jpdf1 ] ) .",
    "remarkably , no condensation is observed when @xmath462 s are non - interacting ( apart from their global constraints on the sums ) , which can be easily checked by solving saddle - point equations explicitly for the case @xmath472 .",
    "this provides an interesting case where two constraints alone are not sufficient to induce condensation , but also an interaction is needed .",
    "finally , it would also be interesting to look for condensation - like phenomena in time - dependent fluctuations rather than in steady states , e.g. in markov processes conditioned on a rare event @xcite .",
