    "fano resonances are a commonplace phenomena arising from a competition between two competing scattering paths , one path sensitive to the energy of the scattering state , one path not .",
    "these resonances were first studied by the eponymous u. fano@xcite in the context of photoionization experiments in atomic systems where a continuum of states interacting with a single resonant level serve as the active ionization pathways .",
    "this work@xcite predicted that interference between two scattering paths will in general lead to asymmetrically shaped resonances as a function of scattering energy .",
    "research on fano resonances in atomic systems remains a topic of active interest.@xcite resonances of similar origin have long been known to characterize scattering off nuclei.@xcite more recently they have been observed in the context of interference in quantum well systems,@xcite polymer films,@xcite tunneling into and between multi - wall carbon nanotubes,@xcite and stm measurements of adsorbed magnetic atoms on metallic substrates,@xcite particularly interesting from a mesoscopic viewpoint in that kondo physics comes into play .",
    "in this article we will be interested in yet another manifestation of fano resonances , that involving single electron transistors ( sets ) .",
    "interference between two tunneling paths , one path involving an set embedded in an arm of an aharonov - bohm ring , was first studied in ref . .",
    "however asymmetric resonances typical of the phenomena were only first reported in the conductance profiles of sets several years thereafter.@xcite in this work , the exact geometry of the interfering tunneling paths through the set was left unspecified , a situation again seen in the experiments of ref . .",
    "more recently , kobayashi et al.@xcite have reported fano resonances in sets embedded in aharonov - bohm rings where necessarily the two tunneling paths are clearly delineated .",
    "an set ( or more colloquially , a quantum dot ) is fabricated from a gated semiconductor heterostructure such as gaas / algaas and is formed from a segregated nanometer scale sized region of a two dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) .",
    "such quantum dots are highly tunable .",
    "both the hopping between the dot and the bulk of the 2deg as well as the dot s energy levels relative to the 2deg s fermi surface can be adjusted through metallic gates placed on the heterostructure . at sufficiently small temperatures ( much smaller than the dot level spacing and tunneling widths )",
    "only the electron levels on the dot nearest in energy to the fermi energy of the bulk 2deg contribute to transport , turning the system into a quantum impurity problem .",
    "as is the case in such problems , the effective dimensionality of the bulk 2deg is @xmath0 in regards to questions concerning the impurity , a result of focusing upon low energy impurity s - wave scattering.@xcite with @xmath1 , the bulk electrons can be treated as living in leads .",
    "the remarkable ability to control the various parameters of a quantum dot has allowed kondo physics to be observed in such a setting.@xcite tuning the dot such that one electron sits on the dot level nearest the fermi surface gives rise to the much of the same physics as an isolated magnetic impurity.@xcite . with the introduction of a second tunneling path , kondo physics does not disappear,@xcite but as we will argue , takes on a considerably different guise .",
    "= 0.35    in figure 1 we sketch out the relevant energy scales of the dot with only its energy level nearest the bulk fermi surface drawn .",
    "the energy levels of the two ` leads ' are marked as forming a continuum filled to levels marked by two chemical potentials , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the active dot level is characterized by two energy scales , one marking the energy of single occupancy , @xmath4 , the other marking the energy of double occupancy , @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 here represents roughly the charging energy incurred from the addition of the second electron into the level . separating the active level from the two leads",
    "are two tunnel barriers .",
    "as drawn , the hybridization of the electrons living on the level with those in the leads gives rise to the broadening of the level to a width , @xmath7 .",
    "represented in the capacitively coupled gate voltage , @xmath8 , is the ability to shift @xmath4 relative to @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the properties of a single level set are believed to be well captured by the anderson model.@xcite theoretical computations of the finite temperature linear response conductance in the kondo regime , a non - trivial quantity , both using numerical renormalization group techniques@xcite and the anderson s model underlying integrability@xcite well match the observations.@xcite moreover qualitative predictions resulting from the out - of - equilibrium anderson model,@xcite namely the splitting of the zero bias anomaly into two peaks , have been observed@xcite ( although the predicted zero temperature features of the peaks @xcite have not yet been seen @xcite ) .",
    "a continuum anderson model governing the quantum dot is given by @xmath9 here @xmath10 are electrons living in the leads / dot . hopping between the two is governed by @xmath11 . as indicated in figure 1 , @xmath12 marks the dot single level energy while @xmath6 describes the additional cost of double occupancy .",
    "this description of an set yields a single , resonant tunneling path for electrons traveling from the right to the left lead .",
    "a second non - resonant tunneling path in the vicinity of the dot can arise in a variety of manners .",
    "this path can occur through the dot itself,@xcite a product perhaps of the detailed geometry of the confining region of the 2deg.@xcite alternatively , the second path can be spatially separated as occurs when a quantum dot is embedded in an arm of an aharonov - bohm ring,@xcite as pictured in figure 2 .",
    "this is in some sense preferable as the two tunneling paths are then marked concretely by the two arms of the ring .",
    "we model the second tunneling path in the most minimal way possible by adding to the anderson model above ( [ eii ] ) the term , @xmath13 such a term has been considered previously in a number of places.@xcite it allows the electrons to bypass the dot through a direct lead - lead tunneling term . in adding @xmath14 , we allow the possibility of multiple windings as electrons transit successively from one lead to the other via different paths .",
    "this modified hamiltonian is thus appropriate to describing an aharonov - bohm ring in a two terminal geometry,@xcite not the four terminal setup of ref . .",
    "the second tunneling path is potential - like in structure .",
    "indeed with the introduction of even and odd combinations of electrons , @xmath15 the addition is precisely a potential scattering term .    at the centre of this work",
    "lies the discovery that this hamiltonian , @xmath16 , is integrable .",
    "while it has long been known that the anderson model alone is integrable,@xcite only recently has it been realized that the addition , @xmath17 , to the hamiltonian does not spoil the integrability.@xcite as will be shown here , the perturbation , @xmath17 , modifies the integrable structure of the anderson model in a straightforward way .",
    "while this modification is minor in a technical sense , it will have profound effects on the transport properties of the system .",
    "= 0.35    = 0.55    at the heart of the model s integrability lies the knowledge of the model s exact eigenfunctions . from the knowledge of the exact eigenfunctions",
    ", we are able to extract the behaviour of excitations above an interacting fermi sea . in particular we can compute the _ dressed _ scattering matrices of the excitations both with themselves and off the impurity . while the integrability of the anderson model has been long established , it was only recently understood@xcite how to we d integrable data with a landauer - bttiker framework to access transport properties . in particular , in ref .",
    "it was shown how the knowledge of the excitations above the fermi sea and their associated scattering phases allow the computation of both the in - equilibrium and out - of - equilibrium conductances .",
    "much of the content of ref . was devoted to understanding how to treat both finite temperature , @xmath18 , and voltage , @xmath11 , transport in the context of integrability . at finite @xmath18 and @xmath11 various uncertainties",
    "plagued the discussion .",
    "away from the fermi surface , electronic excitations could be constructed only in an ambiguous fashion .",
    "the association of a finite energy electron with a particular integrable excitation was then left unfixed .",
    "this ambiguity was overcome only in a number of cases with some educated guesswork . in this way ref .",
    "was able to reproduce the finite temperature linear response conductance determined from numerical renormalization group calculations.@xcite here , in contrast , we will focus upon zero temperature , linear response transport .",
    "there is no ambiguity in identifying the necessary electronic excitations and their scattering phases at the zero - temperature fermi surface .",
    "as such the results contained herein should be considered exact and without approximation .    at zero temperature , the linear response conductance in the @xmath19 anderson model , @xmath20 , is described by the friedel sum rule .",
    "the friedel sum rule relates the scattering phase , @xmath21 , at the fermi surface to the number of electrons sitting on the dot , @xmath22 with the second tunneling path activated , we find that a variant of the friedel sum rule still holds .",
    "but now the scattering at the fermi surface is related to the total number of electrons displaced by the impurity ( here the impurity should be thought of as both the dot and @xmath23 ) : @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "while the additive constant , @xmath26 , is important , the crucial difference between the two expressions for the scattering phase lies in that @xmath27 is distinct from @xmath28 .",
    "at least for @xmath29 , exact diagonalization computations that complement the integrable analysis indicate that @xmath30 involves both contributions from the dot degrees of freedom as well as bulk electrons in the leads : @xmath31;\\cr\\cr n_{\\rm imp { \\downarrow } } & = & n_{d{\\downarrow } } + \\int dx \\bigg [ \\langle c^{\\dagger}_{e{\\downarrow}}(x ) c_{e{\\downarrow}}(x)\\rangle - \\rho_{\\rm bulk}\\bigg ] .",
    "\\cr & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath32 equals the unperturbed ( absent the impurity ) density of states of the lead electrons .",
    "it is hardly surprising that deviations of the electron density in the leads should affect scattering at the fermi surface .",
    "this was specifically forewarned as a possibility in the proof of the friedel sum rule for the anderson model by langreth.@xcite and we know such deviations in the lead electron density are important for determining the finite field scattering phase ( and so the magnetoconductance ) in the kondo model.@xcite instead what turns out here to be surprising is that @xmath33 is not a continuous function of @xmath34 .    as a function of @xmath34 , @xmath27 sees two discontinuities .",
    "the first discontinuity occurs at @xmath34 non - zero , i.e. at @xmath35 .",
    "the origin of this discontinuity is perhaps clearest at @xmath36 , at what would be the particle - hole symmetric point of the anderson model if @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath34 finite then breaks particle - hole symmetry . in this breaking of the symmetry ,",
    "a two - fold degeneracy of the ground state is broken leading to a first order quantum phase transition .",
    "the two putative ground states carry different electron occupancy .",
    "their breaking leads then to a discontinuous change in @xmath27 by one electron .",
    "at least at the point @xmath36 , this conclusion is supported by an exact diagonalization study .    a second first order transition as a function of @xmath34 occurs approximately when the two tunneling paths become equal in strength .",
    "the sign of @xmath34 at which the transition occurs is a function of @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath38 , transport is naturally expressed in terms of particles ( as opposed to holes ) and the transition occurs at @xmath39 where @xmath40 is given by ( for @xmath41 ) @xmath42 this positive value of @xmath34 marks the energy necessary to ionize an electron from the vicinity of the impurity . if @xmath43 , transport is most naturally given in terms of holes and the second transition occurs at @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45 then marks the energy necessary to ionize a hole from the impurity site .",
    "these two transitions in @xmath34 do not persist to all @xmath12 .",
    "rather they are bounded ( roughly ) to fall in the range @xmath46 where @xmath47 equals @xmath48 @xmath47 marks the point where the disturbance in the impurity density of states due to @xmath34 occurs above the fermi surface and so is excluded from contributing to the scattering phase .",
    "these transitions are encoded in figure 3 , a phase diagram of the anderson model as a function of @xmath12 and @xmath34 .",
    "each area of the phase diagram is marked by its characteristic value of @xmath27 .",
    "the horizontal dashed ( blue ) line segments mark the two sets of first order phase transition . on the phase transition lines themselves ,",
    "@xmath49 ( not marked in figure 3 ) .",
    "the termini of these phase transitions are delineated by solid vertical ( red ) lines .",
    "although the phase transitions at @xmath50 and @xmath51 are drawn so as to end both simultaneously at @xmath47 and @xmath52 , the termini differ by a value of order @xmath7 .",
    "the vertical lines also mark regions of rapid ( although not discontinuous ) variation in @xmath27 .",
    "the conductance , @xmath53 , is simply expressible in terms of the scattering phase ( at @xmath54 where @xmath55 ) , @xmath56 by making the identifications , @xmath57 @xmath53 can be put into a fano - like form , @xmath58 however this form is somewhat misleading .",
    "@xmath59 is not be identified with @xmath60 as is true in the @xmath61 case .",
    "in fact unlike the non - interacting case , we find the many - body correlations introduced by finite @xmath6 can lead to the non - vanishing of @xmath53 as @xmath12 is varied with @xmath62 still real",
    ". it would be interesting to reconsider then the analysis of the fano resonances found in ref .",
    "( although the large magnetic fields at which the resonances were observed might largely eliminate many - body effects ) .",
    "the origin of the phase transitions and their attendant consequences can be understood not only as a consequence of many - body interactions but of mere quantum mechanics as well .",
    "the exact solution of the @xmath63 anderson model dictates that the ground state consists of a sea of two - electron repulsively interacting bound states .",
    "( this feature of the ground state is independent of @xmath34 and holds true for the @xmath50 anderson model . )",
    "while this feature results from the exact treatment of the many body physics in the problem , the origin of the discontinuous behaviour in @xmath27 can be seen in the bare bound states themselves .",
    "if one computes the finite @xmath34 scattering phase of a two - electron bound state off the impurity ( a quantum mechanical problem ) , one sees that it is characterized as a function of energy by a number of non - analyticities .",
    "the close relationship between the undressed bound state scattering phase , the impurity occupancy , @xmath27 , and so ultimately the dressed scattering phase at the fermi surface results in transport properties sharing these same non - analyticities .",
    "the explicit construction of the bound state wave function and a display of the non - analyticities are carried out in section ii.b.3 .",
    "the appearance of non - analyticities in the bound state scattering phase and so transport properties is in part a consequence of the treatment of the two tunneling paths , @xmath64 in @xmath65 , the two tunneling terms are presented as both infinitely narrow with delta - function strength . however in any real experimental system the two tunneling terms will have finite , differing widths",
    ". in general unequal widths can lead to changes in the physics .",
    "if for example the width of the lead - lead term is much greater than the width of the dot - lead coupling , i.e. @xmath66 , the effect of the second tunneling path on the physics becomes relatively trivial .",
    "the results presented in this article are presumed valid only if @xmath67 .",
    "more is said on this in section ii.b.1 .",
    "@xmath65 also treats the two tunnelings as occurring at the same point , @xmath68 .",
    "if in the effective theory we were to displace the scattering terms by some arbitrarily small distance the non - analyticities disappear .",
    "the distinction can be made clear by considering the single electron @xmath61 scattering phase .",
    "the scattering phase of @xmath69 at wavevector q is given by @xmath70 notice that @xmath34 appears within the argument of the arctan .",
    "in the case of a quantum dot embedded in an aharonov - bohm ring , this form of the scattering phase results from topology , from the possibility of multiple windings around the ring .",
    "while we are ultimately interested in the scattering phase of bound states , this form of the scattering phase is crucial if non - analyticities in @xmath34 are to arise .",
    "now if instead we shift ( say ) the potential scattering to @xmath71 , i.e. @xmath72 the scattering phase reads instead @xmath73 we now have excluded the possibility of multiple windings and the limit of the bound state scattering phase as a function of @xmath34 will be entirely well behaved .",
    "generically the tunneling terms will not exactly coincide and we will have the situation as given in ( [ eixiv ] ) .",
    "this is reassuring . if potential scattering was always to have drastic consequences we would need to explain why its presence is not always felt in experiments in magnetic impurities in bulk metals .",
    "the effective anderson hamiltonian of a magnetic impurity in a bulk metal will generally not possess particle - hole symmetry .",
    "thus it will include , however small , a potential scattering term .",
    "however the coincidence of dot and potential scattering centers as given in ( [ eixi ] ) requires some enforcement mechanism ( such as perhaps the topological possibility of multiple windings arising for a quantum dot embedded in a ring ) .",
    "this enforcement mechanism will not be present in the general case and potential scattering will be innocuous .    what then is the likelihood that the scattering phase appearing in ( [ eixii ] ) is relevant to understanding fano resonances in quantum dots ?",
    "certainly this phase is generic theoretically.@xcite the differences between our work and other analyses detailed in this article arise not because of the form of @xmath74 , but because of the treatment of interactions on the quantum dot .",
    "but what is the situation experimentally ?",
    "while fano resonances have been observed , their observation does not necessarily preclude the form of the scattering phase in eqn .",
    "( [ eixiv ] ) .",
    "one possible means of distinguishing between the two forms of the scattering phase lies in the effect of finite interactions . as we present in section vi , various features of the observations found in ref .",
    "suggest a role for finite interactions only consistent with ( [ eixii ] ) . however this can not be considered definitive while the role interactions play in other reports of fano resonances@xcite is undetermined .    the dramatic effect",
    "potential scattering presents is not only a consequence of the coincidence of scattering centers .",
    "it reflects the entanglement of charge and spin degrees of freedom that occurs in the anderson model . in the kondo model",
    ", one may add a potential scattering term with strength , @xmath34 , and maintain the model s integrability .",
    "if the scattering phase at the fermi surface is then computed one finds @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the original contribution of the screened spin to the scattering phase while @xmath77 is a smooth function of the strength , @xmath34 .",
    "this scattering phase then behaves in the same fashion as the scattering phase for an anderson model with potential scattering but without coincident scattering centers .",
    "the trivial effect of potential scattering is a result of the complete uncoupling of spin and charge degrees of freedom in the kondo model .",
    "potential scattering acts directly only in the charge sector while all the non - perturbative physics occurs in the spin sector .",
    "thus potential scattering is unable to effect the kondo physics in an interesting fashion .",
    "this limitation is removed however for the anderson model where the two sectors can interact .",
    "a consequence of this behaviour is that the anderson model with potential scattering can not be treated via a schrieffer - wolff ( sw ) transformation.@xcite to implement the standard sw transformation on @xmath78 , one should first transform away the potential scattering term via @xmath79 this gauge transformation transforms @xmath80 into the ordinary anderson model with renormalized parameters , @xmath81 and @xmath82 : @xmath83 the sw transformation taking the anderson model to a kondo model goes forward as usual by freezing out charge excitations .",
    "the scattering of the transformed electrons at the fermi surface is the kondo scattering phase @xmath84 while the scattering phase of the original electrons will have the form @xmath85 that is , one restores the scattering phase due to potential scattering that was originally transformed away . comparing this result with ( [ eixiv ] ) or ( [ eixv ] ) , suggests that an sw transformation performed in such a fashion implicitly assumes the potential scattering term is not exactly at @xmath68 .",
    "alternatively , the gauge transformation in ( [ eixvi ] ) together with the sw transformation seem to mistreat the coupling between the spin and charge sectors of the theory .",
    "we will sharpen our critique of the gauge transformation in ( [ eixvi ] ) in what follows ( see in particular section v ) .    while the sw transformation fails to describe the physics of the @xmath63 anderson model , this failure",
    "does not imply that kondo physics is absent .",
    "one hallmark of kondo physics is the presence of the abrikosov - suhl resonance .",
    "this is an enhancement in the low energy spectral weight of the impurity degrees of freedom .",
    "this ensures quantities such as the zero temperature magnetoconductance vary rapidly on the order of the kondo temperature , @xmath86 . at @xmath63 , low energy spectral",
    "weight is in general still present in the kondo regime ( @xmath87 ) of the anderson model but in modified form . with @xmath34",
    "finite , spectral weight present near the fermi surface is shifted .",
    "the nature of this shift can be read off from the value of @xmath27 in figure 3 .",
    "for @xmath50 we have @xmath49 for @xmath87 . taking @xmath34 finite , @xmath27 shifts to @xmath88 or @xmath89 .",
    "a shift of @xmath27 to 2 coincides with low lying spectral weight just above the fermi surface being transferred to just below .",
    "the corresponding absence of spectral weight at low but positive energies leads to the magnetoconductance being insensitive to small changes in @xmath90 .",
    "analogously , a shift of @xmath27 from @xmath91 to @xmath92 implies that low energy weight has been transferred from just below the fermi surface to just above .",
    "here in contrast the magnetoconductance becomes all the more sensitive to small changes in @xmath90 .",
    "the magnetoconductance is discussed in detail in section ii.b .    with these comments in hand",
    ", we now outline the course of the paper .",
    "a preliminary , considerably more terse , treatment of this subject has already appeared.@xcite in section ii we outline the exact solution of the finite @xmath63 anderson model .",
    "we begin by introducing the model followed by the development of the bethe ansatz solution in several steps . by constructing the single and two - particle eigenstates of the model we are able to extract the scattering matrices / phases .",
    "the structure of these scattering matrices demonstrate that the model is integrable . beyond the scattering in the system ,",
    "the two particle eigenstates allow us to exhibit the nature of the bound states .",
    "as we have already indicated , much of the physics is encoded in the scattering of the bound states off the impurity . by further sketching the development of multi - particle eigenstates ,",
    "we are able to argue that in all details but the impurity scattering phase , the equations describing the quantization of momentum in the system , the bethe ansatz equations , are identical to the @xmath50 case .",
    "this allows us readily to develop the method by which dressed scattering phases of electrons at the fermi surface are computed . in the first part of section",
    "ii we limit ourselves to the case @xmath93 .",
    "we so end section ii by extending the analysis to @xmath94 .",
    "this extension will prove essential when we come to compute the conductance exactly at @xmath36 .    in section iii",
    "we develop the resulting properties of the linear response conductance .",
    "we begin by computing the zero field conductance .",
    "we carefully associate discontinuous changes in @xmath27 with similar changes in the conductance .",
    "the appearance of the discontinuous changes finds support in exact diagonalization computations which show similar discontinuous changes in the ground state occupancy .",
    "key features of @xmath53 as both a function of @xmath34 and @xmath12 are described here .",
    "in particular the ingredients going into the phase diagram of figure 3 are established .",
    "having described @xmath95 , we then turn to understanding the magnetoconductance .",
    "here we are able to characterize analytically the behaviour of the @xmath96 conductance at @xmath36 .",
    "away from @xmath36 we rely upon numerical solutions of the equations describing the dressed scattering phases .",
    "the role two - electron bound states play in the exact solution of the @xmath63 anderson model is ultimately a consequence of a finite @xmath6 . with @xmath61 , the behaviour of the conductance , @xmath53 , as a function of @xmath34 is relatively bland .",
    "this points to a non - perturbative role for @xmath6 . to reinforce this , in section",
    "iv we consider the solution of the @xmath63 anderson model for @xmath97 . with @xmath97 ,",
    "all non - analyticities in @xmath34 disappear suggesting that various impurity quantities do not possess well - behaved power series expansions in @xmath98 as with the @xmath50 model .    in the penultimate section v",
    ", we analyze an alternative approach to this problem , an approach predicated on the use of dyson equations and developed in ref . and ref .",
    "this approach leads to transport quantities being analytic in both @xmath6 and @xmath34 and so to considerably different results than presented in this article .",
    "we will argue that the differences arise because the dyson equations treat the impurity occupancy , @xmath27 , as equivalent to @xmath28 , the number of electrons on the dot itself .",
    "we will equate the dyson equations to the results obtained through applying the gauge transformation in ( [ eixvi ] ) .",
    "this will enable us to argue that even at the quantum mechanical level , the dyson equations seem to incorrectly treat finite interactions .",
    "we believe that the origin of the discrepancy between the two approaches lies in that the dyson equations presume implicitly both @xmath34 and @xmath6 are perturbative quantities and so end with quantities well behaved in @xmath34 and @xmath6 .",
    "in section vi , the final section , we consider the observations reported in gres et al.@xcite as these served as the initial motivation for this work . while hardly determinative , some generic features present in these experiments are well explained using the formalism developed in this work .",

    "the path from @xmath105 to @xmath106 taking the electron through the dot is modeled by @xmath107 .",
    "we have allowed for the possibility that tunneling between the dot and the two leads is asymmetric , i.e. @xmath108 . the second path from @xmath105 to @xmath106 ( for example , the upper arm of the ring in figure 2 ) is modeled by @xmath109 , a potential scattering - like term .",
    "we have also included a term in the hamiltonian , @xmath110 , by which electrons again experience a single - body potential but one which does not scatter the electrons into the other lead .",
    "although likely to be generically present , we here consider such a term for technical reasons alone , as will be seen shortly .",
    "@xmath111 describes the energies associated with the dot .",
    "the dot single particle hilbert space is two fold : one for occupancy by a spin @xmath112-electron and one for occupancy by a spin-@xmath113 electron .",
    "the chemical potential of these levels is controlled by @xmath114 while coulomb interactions on the dot are represented by the term @xmath115 .",
    "this is in fact the only interacting term in the problem  the leads are treated as fermi liquids .",
    "this is reasonable as the one - dimensional leads ultimately arise out of a dimensional reduction of electrons living in two or three dimensions . although @xmath6 is the only non - trivial interaction in the problem , it presents the same set of complications seen in a fully interacting system .    to treat this hamiltonian",
    "we want first to map it to a model involving a single electron specie .",
    "this can not be done for the general values of @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and @xmath119 .",
    "however if we restrict ourselves to the parameter space , @xmath120 we can proceed .",
    "note that if the dot - lead coupling is symmetric ( or if @xmath19 ) then @xmath116 and @xmath117 must vanish . with this constraint on the parameter space",
    "we introduce even and odd electrons , @xmath121 , via @xmath122 the hamiltonian in this basis then reads @xmath123 where @xmath124 the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath125 are given by @xmath126 @xmath7 represents the total broadening of the electron dot level due to coupling to the leads while @xmath125 represent the effective potential scattering seen by the even and odd electrons .",
    "the odd sector of the theory , uncoupled to the dot , is trivial .",
    "the even sector , we will argue , is solvable via bethe ansatz .",
    "having undertaken this recasting of the hamiltonian we must describe how to maintain contact with the original problem : the transport of electrons from the left lead to the right lead and vice versa .",
    "we can do this as follows .",
    "let @xmath127 be the transmission amplitude of an electron from lead @xmath128 to lead @xmath129 and @xmath130 the reflection amplitude of an electron in lead @xmath128 back into the same lead .",

    "the effect of @xmath34 upon the dot correlator is to renormalize the bare values of @xmath7 and @xmath12 : @xmath696 once this renormalization is taken into account , @xmath34 can henceforth be ignored . invoking the friedel sum rule ,",

    "thus we ask that the number of electrons displaced by the impurity equal the number of electrons sitting on the dot . as we have argued in both section ii and iii , this is clearly not the case with the bethe ansatz computation .",

    "( on the other hand , if one was interested in quantities involving the dot degrees of freedom alone , this gauge transformation is more than adequate . )",

    "the first term in the above involving @xmath715 is the phase due to the interaction between the two electrons .",
    "it disappears if @xmath61 .",
    "if the gauge transformation led to equivalent results we would find that the scattering phase can be written as @xmath716 where the final contribution to the phase , @xmath717 , is added in undoing the transformation .",
    "as is easily checked , the two expressions are not equivalent . in the presence of finite @xmath6 ,",
    "the gauge transformation thus does not lead to the correct form of the scattering phase .",
    "while this is our most definite critique of the dyson equations , we can draw attention to two other more amorphous difficulties with the approach .",
    "the first stems from discrepancies between the direct computation of a correlator and computing it using the dyson equation .",
    "we have already seen this issue arise at @xmath658 in computing @xmath718 . and we find it persists to finite dot - lead coupling , @xmath11 . to this end , consider the dyson relation for @xmath719 : @xmath720 if we then employ the correlators in ( [ evxi ] ) to determine the @xmath658 retarded lead - lead correlators appearing in ( [ evxxix ] ) , we find @xmath721 but if we compute @xmath719 directly using the equations of motion ( [ evvi ] ) and mode expansions ( [ evvii ] ) , we find instead @xmath722 we see that even at @xmath723 , the two methods of computing @xmath724 give a discrepancy of @xmath725 .",
    "agreement between the two computations moves much further apart if we instead take @xmath726 to vanish identically as was originally indicated by the equations of motion , i.e. as in ( [ evix ] ) .",
    "thus we generally find discrepancies between the computation of correlators using the dyson relations and a direct computation using the equations of motion .",
    "we could eliminate the discrepancy between ( [ evxxx ] ) and ( [ evxxxi ] ) by instead ( again ) computing @xmath727 and then using the dyson relations in ( [ evx ] ) to compute @xmath728 , but this is not overly satisfying .",
    "the problematic nature of the dyson s relations at @xmath61 does not instill confidence in their use at finite u.    the second difficulty arises in that the dyson relations express all quantities in terms of the dot correlator , @xmath729 , and non - interacting ( @xmath658 ) lead - lead correlators .",
    "now we believe that it is correct to treat @xmath729 as perturbative in both @xmath6 and @xmath34 ( just as the gauge transformation in ( [ eixvi ] ) leads to correct results for dot quantities ) . at @xmath61 , the only effect of @xmath34 on @xmath730",
    "is to renormalize both @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "thus the perturbative series in @xmath6 for the @xmath730 correlator must be well - behaved and convergent for the same reason it is at arbitrary @xmath11 and @xmath12 but @xmath50 . but while @xmath684 is perturbative in @xmath6 and @xmath34 , @xmath728 need not be ( and must not be for consistency with our solution ) . thus expressing @xmath728 in terms of @xmath731 correlators and @xmath729",
    "is a mistake .",
    "it implicitly assumes the problem is perturbative in both @xmath34 and @xmath6 .",

    "it would then seem that in this more extensive regrouping of terms that non - perturbative information is lost .",

    "we note that in experimental measurements on dots with a single tunneling path@xcite , we have @xmath741 . here the anderson model does an excellent job of describing the scaling behaviour of the reported finite temperature linear response conductance .",
    "an alternative approach to understanding the observations of ref . was adopted in clerk et al .",
    "( ref . ) .",
    "there a combination of random matrix theory together with a non - interacting green s function treatment modeling the size and shape of the nano - junction ( following ref . ) was used to describe scattering through a dot coupled to a non - resonant channel .",
    "aspects of the observations in ref . were well described by these methods . in particular ref . was able to reproduce generic features of the linear response conductance both in a magnetic field as well as its response to changes to the dot - lead coupling , @xmath7 .",
    "however these approaches were unable to fully explore the consequences of coulomb interactions .",
    "we , on the other hand , have argued that coulomb interactions lead to highly non - trivial physics non - perturbatively related to the non - interacting case .",
    "nonetheless it is unclear whether this approach here is more appropriate than that adopted in ref . .",
    "at least one can say our approaches share some of the same physics .",
    "we will comment upon this further in the context of actual comparison with experimental data .",
    "report two well developed fano resonances .",
    "the resonances are plotted in figure 23 , appearing as asymmetric dips .",
    "these two dips are ( slightly ) differently shaped with different minima and maxima .    to model these resonances",
    "we must first take into account the possibility of an asymmetry between the dot - lead couplings , i.e. @xmath108 . if @xmath19 , the only effect of @xmath108 is to reduce the maximal possible conductance : @xmath742 however with @xmath118 finite , an asymmetry in @xmath743 produces a more complex effect .",
    "as we indicated in section ii , integrability in the presence of an asymmetry , @xmath744 , requires an additional term in the hamiltonian , @xmath745 with @xmath746 thus in order to take into account the reduction in @xmath747 due to @xmath748 we must tolerate the presence of @xmath749 terms .",
    "however we believe that @xmath749 will only quantitatively change the predicted nature of transport through the impurity .",
    "and a qualitative description is perhaps the best for which can be hoped given the overall simplicity of the model together with the lack of complete understanding of the tunneling paths in the experiment .",
    "we now consider how to fix the various parameters in the hamiltonian .",
    "we take the full width at half maximum of the resonances to be indicative of @xmath750 .",
    "as such the ratio of the distance between the two resonances and @xmath7 is roughly @xmath751 . to determine then @xmath98 we note that the resonances occur roughly at a dot chemical potential corresponding to @xmath448 and @xmath752",
    "thus we must have @xmath753 using ( [ eiiixii ] ) and ( [ eiiixxiii ] ) we then find that @xmath754 ( and consequently the distance between the two resonances corresponds to @xmath6 ) .",
    "this leaves us to determine @xmath119 and @xmath125 .",
    "we know from the analysis of section ii that in general ( unless @xmath755 ) , the conductance at @xmath528 and at @xmath756 is @xmath757 for one of the resonances , we then determine the variation in the conductance , @xmath758 as a function of @xmath34 numerically . knowing @xmath759 and @xmath760 as a function of @xmath34 permits @xmath34 to be then fixed .",
    "we so find @xmath761 . alternatively , and more crudely",
    ", we could use the estimate for @xmath572 given in ( [ eiiixvi ] ) .",
    "if we do so we end up with an estimate of @xmath762 .",
    "the difference between the two computations of @xmath34 arises in that ( [ eiiixvi ] ) is only valid for @xmath34 large . with @xmath34",
    "in hand we can then fix the last unknown , the ratio of @xmath763 to @xmath764 . from ( [ eviv ] )",
    "we find @xmath765 which then leads to @xmath766 .        a final consideration",
    "before a comparison can be made is the determination of how the gate voltage , @xmath8 , applied to the dot is related to the dot chemical potential , @xmath12 . for simplicity",
    "we assume @xmath767 .",
    "midway between the two resonance marks the point @xmath36 .",
    "we can then fix the proportionality constant between @xmath8 and @xmath12 by insisting the positions of the minima of the rightmost resonance match .",
    "having done this , we are thus able to reproduce the behaviour of both fano resonances in a reasonable fashion .",
    "we do note that the predicted conductance in the immediate vicinity of the rightmost resonance overshoots the measured conductance by 15% .",
    "the predicted conductance , g , also possesses a number of sharp features not seen in the data .",
    "however at the particular gate voltages at which these occur , we are comparing a zero temperature computation with finite but low temperature ( @xmath768mk ) data .",
    "as such some of the sharp features could be seen as a @xmath143 artifact .",
    "a notable characteristic of this data set is that the resonances do not vanish .",
    "one possibility is that there is some incoherent background to the conductance , something assumed in ref . .",
    "an incoherent background is necessary if one assumes a non - interacting problem . in such a case",
    "we may write for the conductance ( without a background contribution ) the following , @xmath769 where @xmath770 ( @xmath28 is the total number of electrons sitting on the dot ) and @xmath771 .",
    "thus as @xmath12 is varied ( so changing @xmath28 from @xmath92 to @xmath89 ) , @xmath53 will necessarily vanish at some @xmath12 . in the dyson equation approach",
    "( see section v ) at finite @xmath6 , @xmath53 still vanishes for the same reason . in either case a background contribution to the conductance is needed in order to be consistent with the data set .",
    "as an alternative to explicitly adding a background contribution , one can break time reversal symmetry . with",
    "this symmetry broken , @xmath62 in ( [ evivi ] ) is potentially complex and @xmath53 then need not vanish as @xmath12 is varied .",
    "this is seen in the random matrix treatment of ref . as well as in refs . and where the introduction of an aharonov - bohm phase serves to break time reversal symmetry",
    "the approach used in this article , on the other hand , does not necessitate either the breaking of time reversal symmetry nor the explicit introduction of a @xmath772 .",
    "rather @xmath53 remains finite through the non - perturbative effects of @xmath6 .",
    "although @xmath53 under the bethe ansatz can be cast in the form ( [ evivi ] ) , @xmath695 in this case does not equal @xmath773 .",
    "instead @xmath774 where @xmath27 is the total number of electrons displaced by the impurity .",
    "this quantity , behaving considerably differently than @xmath28 as a function of @xmath12 , does not force the vanishing of @xmath53",
    ".    gres et al .",
    "report on the temperature dependence of the resonances in ref . .",
    "they observe that the region in between the resonances is markedly insensitive to temperature while the resonances themselves grow in a kondo log fashion as the temperature is lowered from @xmath775mk to @xmath768mk .",
    "while we are not prepared to go into an in - depth treatment of the temperature dependence here , we will make a few sketchy comments .        in our discussion of the magnetoconductance in section iii we identified the ranges of values of @xmath34 at @xmath36 where there would be low - lying spectral weight present .",
    "our purpose there was to identify regimes of @xmath34 where small magnetic fields would drastically change the conductance .",
    "but what is true about a finite magnetic field is also true of finite temperature . at @xmath776 and with the parameters ,",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 , identified as above , we expect on the basis of section iii a surfeit of low lying spectral weight .",
    "thus as temperature is lowered we expect the conductance to vary rapidly in the region of @xmath36 . in gres",
    "no such variation is observed .",
    "the cause of this is an extremely low kondo temperature at @xmath528 .",
    "using@xcite @xmath777 as the expression for the kondo temperature , we find @xmath778 as such the temperature range studied in ref .",
    "( @xmath779mk ) is decidedly in the high temperature regime ( in the region of @xmath87 ) .",
    "our zero temperature computation nonetheless finds reasonable agreement because the low temperature behaviour , @xmath780 , is equivalent to the high temperature behaviour , @xmath781 .",
    "this differs markedly from the anderson model at @xmath50 . at @xmath782 the low lying spectral weight ( as encoded in the @xmath553 distribution ) doubles . crudely speaking",
    "then we expect the high temperature scattering phase , @xmath287 , to behave as @xmath783 the shift by @xmath219 ( as opposed to merely @xmath76 at @xmath50 ) thus implies a coincidence of the high and low temperature conductance",
    ". it also explains why our @xmath143 computation adequately conforms to the ( high temperature ) observations ( about @xmath87 ) .    while at @xmath36 the measurements in ref .",
    "are high temperature , the corresponding observations in the region of the resonances may be considered low temperature . in the region of the rightmost resonance , @xmath784 and @xmath785 .",
    "this is consistent with the observations in ref . of the resonance growing in depth as temperature is lowered .",
    "thus at the lowest temperature at which measurements were taken , @xmath768mk , the system is in a low temperature regime .",
    "and consequently we do not the behaviour in the two regimes to coincide to obtain a reasonable match between data and theory .      in ref .",
    ", fano resonances were studied as a function of the total dot - lead coupling strength , @xmath7 , where it was observed that the width of fano resonances exhibit a non - monotonic dependence upon @xmath7 .",
    "( in a dot with a single tunneling path , the width of a resonance merely increases with @xmath7 . ) together with this non - monotonicity , the overall shape and amount of asymmetry in the fano resonances was observed to be sensitive to the strength of @xmath7 .",
    "we can reproduce this array of behaviour . plotted in figure 24",
    "is the linear response conductance for a set of differing @xmath7 s . for @xmath7 small",
    ", a fano resonance appears as a sharply peaked bipolar structure .",
    "as @xmath7 is increased , as navely expected , the bipolar peak broadens . however at some critical value of @xmath786 , the bipolar resonance is replaced by a narrow unipolar one . with further increases in @xmath7",
    ", this resonance broadens out .",
    "we point out that the reported behaviour of the fano resonances as a function of @xmath7 mandates against the form @xmath787 of the single particle scattering phase ( see ( [ eixiv ] ) ) . this is to say , these results imply the scattering due to the two paths",
    "should be treated as coincident ( as contained in ( [ eixii ] ) ) .",
    "this is implicit in both the behaviour of the fano resonances as a function of gate voltage as well as the resonances behaviour in a magnetic field in the following section .",
    "but here we perhaps have a more explicit demonstration .",
    "if the above was appropriate , variations in @xmath7 would not affect the asymmetry parameter , @xmath788 .",
    "but as a measure of the shape of the resonances , @xmath62 must and does vary ( see figure 3 of ref . for explicit numbers ) .    in ref .",
    "a different approach is taken to describe this phenomenon . using a specific microscopic picture of the dot , these authors consider the effect of modifying the second tunneling path ( as opposed to directly changing the strength of the dot - lead hopping of the first tunneling path ) .",
    "they find that the width of the resonances behaves non - monotonically as the strength of an impurity placed in the second pathway is varied .",
    "we might mimic this approach by varying @xmath34 instead of @xmath7 . if we did so , we would certainly find the width of the fano resonances varies non - linearly ( see for example figures 12 and 15 ) .",
    "the behaviour of fano resonances in magnetic fields was also studied in ref . .",
    "it was found that the resonances exhibited a marked response to extremely small magnetic fields ( @xmath789 ) .",
    "in particular they demonstrated that upon application of @xmath90 , a small bipolar fano resonance was transformed into a much larger unipolar structure ( see inset to figure 25 ) .",
    "the authors of ref . suggested the origin of this behaviour lay in the large effective area covered by an electron traversing the dot via the resonant channel .",
    "this large area , @xmath790 , needs a relatively small magnetic field , @xmath90 , to produce a flux @xmath791 significant enough to induce the breakdown of coherent backscattering .",
    "we are able to offer a different explanation found in the kondo - like physics present in our treatment of the problem . from section",
    "iii we know that there exist wide ranges of @xmath34 where a doubling of the low - lying spectral weight at positive energies occurs relative to @xmath37 .",
    "this low - lying spectral weight can be accessed by magnetic fields on the order of the kondo temperature , @xmath86 , as computed in the @xmath50 anderson model . in such ranges of @xmath34 , and as discussed in detail in section iii , we expect a marked sensitivity to small magnetic fields .",
    "it is then not surprising we are able to reproduce the magnetoconductance measurements of ref . .",
    "in figure 25 we find that the conductance for @xmath54 , @xmath792 , and @xmath793 ( with this choice of @xmath34 the low - lying spectral weight has been enhanced in comparison with @xmath50 ) is characterized by a fano resonance with a small bipolar structure . upon introducing a small field , @xmath794 ,",
    "a unipolar peak is superimposed over the bipolar structure . as the field",
    "is increased further ( although still kept to be the same order as the kondo temperature ) this unipolar peak narrows in width .",
    "plotted in the inset to figure 25 are the experimental measurements of the conductance in the presence of a small magnetic field . at @xmath54 , ref .",
    "sees a small bipolar peak which as a small magnetic field is turned on is obliterated by a much larger unipolar structure . that the bipolar structure does not entirely disappear in our calculation is perhaps a reflection that our computation is done at @xmath143 . with finite temperature blurring",
    ", the bipolar peak might completely merge into the larger unipolar structure .    in ref .",
    "this sensitivity to field is explained in a statistical sense .",
    "the introduction of a magnetic field ( of any size ) serves to break time reversal invariance .",
    "the breaking of this discrete symmetry changes the statistical s - matrix ( i.e. it places it in a different universality class ) used by ref . to describe scattering through the dot . at least in an average sense",
    "this change tends to favour larger unipolar over smaller bipolar structures in the conductance .",
