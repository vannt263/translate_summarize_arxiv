    "codex @xcite is a spectrograph planned for the european extremely large telescope ( e - elt ) .",
    "it should provide the first measurement of the cosmological redshift drift ( known as the sandage - loeb test @xcite ) ; a detailed feasibility study has been carried out by liske _",
    "@xcite , and other aspects relevant for our work have been explored in @xcite .",
    "another of its goals is an improved test of the stability of nature s fundamental couplings such as the fine - structure constant @xmath1 and the proton - to - electron mass ratio @xmath2 .",
    "apart from the intrinsic importance of these measurements , they can be used ( under certain assumptions ) for detailed characterization of dark energy properties all the way up to redshift 4 .",
    "this was suggested in @xcite ( see also @xcite for a related approach ) , and an assessment in the context of codex ( and its predecessor espresso ) can be found in @xcite .",
    "we illustrate how codex can probe dark energy beyond the regime where it is dominating the universe s dynamics ",
    "deep in the matter era .",
    "we introduce these two observational tools in sect .",

    "our conclusions are in sect . v.",
    "in realistic dynamical dark energy scenarios the ( presumed ) scalar field should be coupled to the rest of the model , unless one postulates a ( yet unknown ) symmetry to suppress these couplings .",
    "the relevant coupling here is the one between the scalar field and electromagnetism , which we assume to be @xmath3 where the gauge kinetic function @xmath4 is linear , @xmath5 @xmath6 , and the coupling @xmath7 is related to equivalence principle violations .",
    "local constraints are ( conservatively ) @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "independent constraints can be obtained from the cosmic microwave background @xcite , and are currently about one order of magnitude weaker .",
    "this form of @xmath4 can be seen as the first term of a taylor expansion , and given the tight low - redshift constraints on varying couplings and on equivalence principle violations it is a good approximation for the redshift range being considered .",
    "the assumption here is that the dark energy and the varying @xmath1 are due to the same dynamical field , as in the case of nonminimally coupled quintessence models .",
    "we will also assume a flat frw universe with @xmath9 , neglecting the radiation contribution since we are concerned with the low - redshift behavior .",
    "the evolution of @xmath1 is given by @xmath10 and since the evolution of the scalar field can be expressed in terms of the dark energy properties @xmath11 and @xmath12 as @xcite @xmath13 ( where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath14 , @xmath15 being the scale factor ) we finally obtain the evolution of @xmath1 in this class of models @xmath16 as expected the magnitude of the variation is controlled by the strength of the coupling @xmath7 .    the sandage - loeb test @xcite is a measurement of the evolution of the redshift drift of extragalactic objects , obtained by comparing quasar absorption spectra taken at different epochs . in any metric theory of gravity the redshift drift @xmath17 in a time interval @xmath18 , or equivalently",
    "the spectroscopic velocity shift @xmath19 ( which is the directly measured quantity ) is @xmath20\\,.\\ ] ] this provides a direct measurement of the expansion history of the universe , with no model - dependent assumptions beyond those of homogeneity and isotropy .",
    "a positive drift is a smoking gun for a dark energy component accelerating the universe ; a deccelerating universe produces a negative drift .",
    "the lyman-@xmath1 forest ( and possibly other absorption lines , including metal ones ) is ideal for this measurement , but it can only be done at redshifts @xmath21 ( in what follows , we will assume measurements between @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) .",
    "this applies to ground - based facilities ; measurements at lower redshift would be highly desirable ( since they would probe the dark energy dominated epoch ) , but they would need to be done from space , and there is currently no envisaged space - based spectrograph with the required resolution and stability .",
    "_ @xcite have studied in detail the performance of the envisaged codex spectrograph , finding that the uncertainty in the spectroscopic velocity shift is expected to behave as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the signal - to - noise of the spectra , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 and the number of the absorption systems and their respective redshifts .",
    "this assumes photon - noise - limited observations and holds for @xmath28 ; beyond that the last exponent becomes @xmath29 . in our analysis",
    "we will assume @xmath30 , 40 systems uniformly divided into 4 bins at @xmath31 and a time between observations of @xmath32 years .",
    "suppose that the above assumption regarding varying @xmath1 does not hold : the dark energy is due to a cosmological constant ( with @xmath33 ) , and the variation of @xmath1 is due to some other field with a negligible contribution to the universe s energy density .",
    "the bekenstein - sandvik - barrow - magueijo ( bsbm ) model @xcite is precisely of this type ( it has a varying @xmath1 field with an energy density that is no larger than that of radiation ) .",
    "if one neglects the recent dark energy domination one can find an analytic solution for the behavior of @xmath1 @xmath34 where @xmath35 gives the magnitude of the variation .",
    "this is sufficient for our purposes since we are mainly be interested in the matter - era behavior , but regardless of the bsbm motivation we can take this as a phenomenological parametrization . a logarithmic redshift dependence is typical for a dilaton - type scalar field in the matter - dominated era .",
    "this must satisfy the atomic clock bounds at @xmath36 .",
    "now @xmath37 ( @xmath38 being the hubble parameter in units of 100 km / s / mpc ) which according to @xcite is constrained to be @xmath39 one therefore finds @xmath40 .",
    "this is smaller than the value inferred from the published evidence for a time variation of @xmath1 @xcite ( but see also @xcite ) ; conservatively we will assume a variation of 2 parts per million at @xmath41 , in which case @xmath42 .",
    "although the difference is not big given the approximations being made , it does indicate that for the two measurements to be compatible the scalar field must freeze abruptly close to the present time @xcite ; the fact that we have neglected the effect of the onset of dark energy domination will not remove this difference .",

    "( bottom band ) and @xmath49 ( middle ) , compared to the standard @xmath0cdm case ( top band ) .",

    "[ fig2 ] we plot the sandage - loeb signal for some representative models .",
    "notice that for a given amount of @xmath1 variation ( that is , a value of @xmath35 ) , a larger coupling @xmath7 implies a smaller @xmath48 ( a slower - moving scalar field ) and vice - versa .",
    "large values of @xmath48 produce a sandage - loeb signal that codex can easily distinguish from @xmath0cdm , which would highlight the presence of an inconsistency in the assumptions .",
    "conversely small values of @xmath48 yield a sandage - loeb signal indistinguishable from @xmath0cdm , but such a @xmath48 implies a large @xmath7 which could be checked with forthcoming ( improved ) local constraints . in either case , on the assumption that the current evidence for variations is correct , codex in combination with local experiments can support or rule out this class of models .",
    "if the dark energy is a cosmological constant its contribution to the universe s energy budget is subdominant by redshift @xmath52 and negligible for @xmath53 . we now consider the opposite case , where the dark energy remains a significant fraction of the universe s energy density .",
    "this is realized by the early dark energy models of doran and robbers @xcite , in which the dark energy density parameter and equation of state are @xmath54 @xmath55 } \\frac{d\\ln\\omega_{\\phi}(a)}{d\\ln a } + \\frac{a_{eq}}{3(a + a_{eq } ) }   \\label{eq : edew}\\ ] ] @xmath56 being the scale factor at matter - radiation equality ; we still assume a flat universe , so @xmath57 .",

    "the shaded region is ruled out by the bound of eq .",
    "( [ clocks ] ) . ]",
    "the dark energy has a scaling behavior , approaching a finite constant @xmath61 in the past , while its equation of state @xmath62 tracks the dominant energy component .",
    "we assume that the early dark energy field is also coupling to electromagnetism and thus yielding a varying @xmath1 @xcite , and our discussion in sect .",
    "ii , and in particular eqs .",
    "( [ darkside1]-[darkside2 ] ) also apply in this case . here",
    "our analysis is the opposite of that in the previous section : there we assumed a given amount of @xmath1 variation ; here we will assume a given amount of early dark energy , namely @xmath60 , consistent with current bounds allowing for possible @xmath1 variations @xcite .",
    "the local atomic clock bound is now @xmath63 regardless of @xmath61 . for @xmath46 significantly different from @xmath64",
    "this places a model - dependent constraint on @xmath7 that is stronger than the model - independent @xmath65 , but large values of @xmath7 are possible by having @xmath46 sufficiently close to @xmath64 : with @xmath66 and @xmath67 the largest allowed value is @xmath68 ; this highlights the importance of atomic clock constraints , and shows that this model is almost indistinguishable from @xmath0cdm if one is limited to low - redshift observations .",
    "despite the change in the dark energy equation of state at redshift @xmath69few , the sandage - loeb test is unable to distinguish this model from @xmath0cdm , as can be seen in fig .",
    "nevertheless , this model can yield significant variations of @xmath1 , as shown in [ fig4 ] .",
    "codex s baseline sensitivity for @xmath1 measurements is around the @xmath70 level , and as good as @xmath71 for a few ideal systems ; this is enough to detect such variations for @xmath72 and use the measurements to reconstruct @xmath73 , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "we discussed two examples of codex s ability to probe the nature of dark energy beyond the regime where it is dynamically important and highlighted the importance of carrying out both the sandage - loeb test and accurate measurements of nature s fundamental couplings .",
    "all three theoretical pillars of the @xmath0cdm paradigm ( inflation , dark matter and dark energy ) rely on the presence of new , presently unknown physics . in the absence of strong indications for what this new physics is and where it can be found ,",
    "it is important to search for it in multiple places , and codex will have a unique role to play in the @xmath74 redshift range .",
    "our analysis is simplified , but the goal is to illustrate the point at proof - of - concept level .",
    "a detailed study , with precise codex specifications , can be done when these are finalized . finally , we emphasize that these tests do not exist in isolation : synergies can be found with other cosmological experiments , including esa s euclid mission , which will probe lower redshifts .",
    "an analysis of these possibilities , in the context of a broader observational strategy , is left for future work .",
