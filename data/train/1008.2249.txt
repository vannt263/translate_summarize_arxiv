    "ieee 802.11a / b / g / n based wireless lan are used for providing internet access in many places . in",
    "most deployed network a single station ( sta ) can see multiple access points ( aps ) as shown in figure [ fig : arrived_sta ] .",
    "in this situation , stas associate with a particular ap . usually , association of sta with ap is based on snr .",
    "this simple scheme ignores the fact that some aps are loaded heavily while some are underutilized .",
    "hence , load imbalance and lower throughput are some common problems .",
    "prior and contemporary works address these problems by assuming a _ saturated _ traffic model .",
    "they assume that at any point of time , every sta is hungry to send packets across and is always contending for the channel .",
    "however , according to the statistics given in @xcite , 46% of internet traffic is attributed to web browsing , which is more intermittent than saturated .",
    "the reason that it is intermittent rather than saturated is that tcp involved ; we will discuss this in more detail shortly .",
    "while tcp - controlled file downloads in wlans have been studied in @xcite , it was assumed that all stas are associated with the ap as a _",
    "single _ rate . in reality , multiple rates are possible ; for example , 802.11 g offers 8 rates of association .",
    "the study of tcp - controlled file transfers with multiple rates of association has received little attention in the literature ; a first step was taken in @xcite .    even though the literature on association policies is extensive",
    ", the vast majority of the works considers the saturated traffic model .",
    "given the prevalence of tcp - controlled traffic , which does not correspond to the saturated model , and the fact that multiple rates of sta - ap association are possible , one begins to wonder if policies based on a different approach can perform better .",
    "clearly , if this were possible , a very substantial number of wlan users would stand to benefit .",
    "this question motivates the work reported in this paper .",
    "we obtain an association policy for stas in an ieee 802.11 wlan by taking into account explicitly two aspects of practical importance : ( a ) tcp - controlled short file downloads interspersed with read times ( motivated by web browsing ) , and ( b ) different stas associated with an ap at possibly different rates ( depending on distance from the ap ) .        to see why unsaturated traffic makes a difference , we consider figure [ fig : traffic_model ] .",
    "the left part shows a saturated traffic scenario , where all wlan entities have packets to transmit ; therefore , @xmath5 entities contend for the channel .",
    "the right part shows the situation with tcp in the picture .",
    "essentially , for many tcp connections , the entire window of packets sits at the ap , leaving the corresponding stas with nothing to send .",
    "this means that the number of contending wlan entities is much smaller @xcite .",
    "this suggest why approaches relying on saturated traffic may be inadequate .",
    "we approach the problem in two steps .",
    "first , we consider an analytical model to obtain the aggregate ap throughput for long tcp - controlled file downloads when stas are associated at @xmath0 different rates @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 ; this extends earlier work in the literature .",
    "second , we present a 2-node closed queueing network model to approximate the expected average - sized file download time for a user who shares the ap with other users associated at a multiplicity of rates .",
    "these analytical results motivate the proposed association policy , called the estimated delay based ( eda ) policy : associate with the ap at which the expected file download time is the least . to summarize ,",
    "our approach can be depicted as shown in figure [ fig : blockdiagram ] .",
    "our contributions are as follows : + ( i ) we derive a closed form expression for the aggregate throughput of an ap with which stas are associated at multiple data rates .",
    "simulations indicate a very good match with analytical results .",
    "+ ( ii ) we obtain a closed form expression for the mean delay experienced by an sta in downloading an average sized file . again",
    ", simulation results match the analysis very well . + ( iii ) utilizing these results ,",
    "we present an on - line , distributed , client - driven association policy ( eda ) which gives substantially increased throughput for every sta with balanced load among the aps ; throughputs are observed to improve by 12.8% to 46.4% .",
    "* outline of the paper : * in section [ sec : related_work ] we provide a brief overview of related work . in section [ sec : system_model ] we state the assumptions , describe our models and introduce notations . in section [ sec : aggr_thpt ] , we analyze a model for aggregate throughput of an ap with multi - rate association .",
    "section [ sec : bcmp_network ] covers the analysis of average download time in a multirate scenario . in section [ sec : new_association_policy ] , we present a new distributed association policy based on the average file download delay . in section [ sec :",
    "performance_evaluation ] , we provide simulation results that compare eda policy with the snr - based and aggregate throughput maximizing schemes . in section [ sec : extension ] we discuss the results and identify future research directions . finally , in section [ sec :",
    "conclusion ] , we conclude the paper .",
    "from the extensive literature on association in wlans , several themes can be discerned . in the first group ,",
    "a newcomer sta assesses each ap ( that it can hear ) by finding out the per - sta throughput received by stas associated with it currently @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in these papers ,",
    "the authors derive expressions for aggregate ap throughput ( with udp traffic ) , taking into account the number of stas associated , as well as the probability of packet loss due to collisions . from this",
    ", the per - sta throughput can be calculated , and the newcomer associates with the ap for which the per - sta throughput is the highest .    in the second group ,",
    "we have association policies that start from the throughputs that individual stas are getting at present @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . for each sta associated with an ap , the ratio of throughput to the physical rate of association",
    "is obtained , and this fraction is added over all the stas .",
    "this leads to a figure of merit for each ap , and the newcomer chooses the ap with the highest figure of merit .    for a brief overview of the other categories , let us assume that a newcomer sta can hear 3 aps denoted as @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , with @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 stas ( respectively ) associated with them .",
    "suppose the new ap associates with ap @xmath6 .",
    "then , one can imagine an @xmath12 -element vector @xmath13 , listing the throughputs of all stas in the system .",
    "similarly , there would be vectors corresponding to choosing ap @xmath7 @xmath14 and ap @xmath8 @xmath15 .    in the third group , the selection of the ap",
    "is made by considering jain s fairness index @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , corresponding to @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively .",
    "the ap selected is the one for which the jain fairness index is the highest @xcite . in the fourth group",
    ", @xmath22 is mapped to an expression for ap load @xmath23 , and the ap which is least loaded is selected . a variation considers a map from the vector of throughputs @xmath24 and the vector of rates of association to the load @xcite . finally , some association policies base their choice on maximizing the minimum element of @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath15 ( `` max - min fairness '' ) , or maximizing the sum of the logarithms of the elements of @xmath22 , @xmath27 , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "a common assumption in all these policies is that of saturated traffic , viz .",
    ", all wlan entities have packets to send always .",
    "ieee 802.11@xmath0 @xcite define several metrics for radio resource management , including channel load report , bss average access delay and bss load .",
    "any sta can request for channel load report .",
    "other load metrics are broadcast by ap in beacon frames .",
    "these metrics can be utilized in arriving at association decisions .",
    "the proposed eda policy leverages the capabilities provided by 802.11@xmath0 .",
    "our goal is to look for an association policy that takes into account the specifics of tcp - controlled file transfers . to move towards this goal ,",
    "our approach is to model two aspects : the aggregate ap throughput achievable in a multirate scenario and the expected time to download a file .",
    "models for these two aspects are developed in section [ sec : asm_ap ] and [ sec : asm_web ] respectively . in section [ sec : asm_gen ] , we discuss the general assumptions that we have made .",
    "we consider a single cell 802.11 a / b / g /",
    "n of @xmath28 ( large ) stas associated with a single ap as shown in figure [ fig : ap_sta ] .",
    "all nodes are contending for the channel using the dcf mechanism .",
    "stas are associated with the ap at @xmath29 different physical rates .",
    "we assume that there are no link error and packets in the medium are lost due to collisions only .",
    "the ap is connected to a file server by a wire as shown in figure [ fig : ap_sta ] . in this paper",
    ", we assume that round trip time ( rtt ) is very small .",
    "each sta has a single tcp connection to download a large file from a local file server . in other words ,",
    "the traffic model is homogeneous across stas and no other traffic is present .",
    "the ap delivers tcp packets towards stas and an sta returns tcp - ack packets .",
    "there are several simultaneous tcp connections ; every sta and the ap is contending for the channel .",
    "further , as no preference is given to the ap , the ap is modelled as being backlogged permanently @xcite .",
    "we assume that the ap uses the rts - cts mechanism while sending packets to the stas and an sta uses basic access to send tcp - ack packets .",
    "as soon as an sta receives a data packet , it generates a tcp - ack packet without any delay and this is placed in the mac queue .",
    "also , we assume that all the nodes have sufficiently large buffer space , so that packets are not lost due to buffer overflow .",
    "moreover , recovery form collision occurs before tcp time outs and tcp start - up transients are ignored .",
    "we consider a given ap and a fixed number of stas associated with it ; in other words , no new sta arrives and no associated sta leaves the system .",
    "aggregate throughput of the ap is shared equally among all @xmath30 stas .",
    "hence the ap is modelled as a processor sharing queue .",
    "we assume that a file downloaded by an sta can belong to one of @xmath31 different classes , a file of class @xmath32 , @xmath33 , is distributed exponentially , with mean size @xmath34 .",
    "after downloading a file , an sta goes into the `` reading '' state . for a class @xmath32",
    "file , the reading time is distributed exponentially also , with the mean being @xmath35 .",
    "the reading state is modelled by a ./m/@xmath36 queue .",
    "further , upon completion of reading , an sta downloads a fresh file of random size having mean @xmath34 with probability @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "together , the ap queue and the `` reading '' queue constitute a closed queueing network .",
    "in this section , we are interested in obtaining a method to compute the aggregate throughput achieved by the ap .",
    "we assume that each sta is downloading an infinitely long file from a server attached to the ap via a wired network ( for example , an ethernet cable ) .",
    "a tcp packet transmitted to _ any _ sta is considered in obtaining the throughput expression ; hence the resulting expression yields the aggregate throughput across all tcp connections .",
    "the result obtained here will be used as a part of the model presented in the next section .",
    "packets for every sta have to go through the ap and every sta replies with a tcp - ack .",
    "hence , all stas along with the ap are contending for the channel .",
    "the ap does not have any preference over stas , and it is modelled as being backlogged permanently . in this condition",
    ", we can model the performance of the ap as in @xcite .",
    "the basic approach is to consider consecutive successful transmissions by the ap or one of the stas . at these epochs",
    ", we consider the number of stas at rate @xmath39 , @xmath40 , with tcp - ack packets in them .",
    "this @xmath0-element non negative vector , embedded at consecutive successful transmission epochs , can be seen to be a discrete time markov chain ( dtmc ) , and this dtmc is part of a markov renewal sequence defined at the consecutive success epochs . to obtain the aggregate ap throughput",
    ", we appeal to the renewal reward theorem @xcite , where a reward of 1 accrues at every successful transmission by the ap . owing to lack of space ,",
    "we provide only a sketch of the argument ; more details can be found in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath41 be the number of stas associated with the ap at rate @xmath39 , where @xmath42 .",
    "the analysis proceeds by assuming @xmath43 to be large .",
    "different data rates ]    as in @xcite we can get the aggregate tcp throughput of the ap as + @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the equilibrium probability of the dtmc being in state @xmath46 , @xmath47 is the sojourn time in a dtmc state and @xmath48 is the expected sojourn time , given that the dtmc state is @xmath49 .",
    "to verify the accuracy of the model , we performed experiments using the qualnet 4.5 network simulator @xcite .",
    "we considered 802.11b physical data rates as 1mbps , 2mbps , 5.5mbps and 11mbps , depending on the physical distance from the ap . in table",
    "[ table : aps_stas ] , results are given for a few cases of this multirate scenario , i.e. , with different number of stations .",
    ".analysis and simulation results [ _ mbps _ ] for multirate ap in ieee 802.11__b _ _ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     throughput [ mbps ] with 95% confidence intervals obtained by simulation for 3 different scenarios shown in figures [ fig : ap2_shade ] , [ fig : ap4_shade ] and [ fig : ap9_shade ] .",
    "@xmath50 = 0.9 , average file sizes of 50 kb and 750 kb with reading times as 40s and 120s respectively .",
    "probability of selecting smaller file is 0.6 .",
    "arrival rate of sta is 0.5 per second .",
    "[ table : compare_thpt ]    the graph shown in figure [ fig : confidence_05 ] is the average of 50 runs of the same experiment with the same parameters with different seeds .",
    "the arrival rate is chosen as 0.5 per second .",
    "the 95 % confidence interval is also shown in the graphs for the aggregate throughput .",
    "similarly for the graph in figure [ fig : confidence_1ps ] , the arrival rate stas is 1 per second .     with arrival rate of stas as 0.5 per second in the scenario of figure [ fig : ap9_shade ] with 9 aps ]     with arrival rate of stas as 1 per second for scenario shown in figure [ fig : ap9_shade ] ]    it can be seen that eda performs distinctly better than the other policies . from figure",
    "[ fig : confidence_05 ] , we see that the extent of improvement increases as the arrival process becomes more skewed spatially ( higher values of @xmath51 ) .",
    "the relative improvement is not as appreciable in figure @xcite , all aps are subjected to higher load , and different policies cease to make a significant difference .    next we compare the four ap selection methods in terms of fairness .",
    "jain s fairness index @xcite is used for the comparison .",
    "jain s fairness index is given by + @xmath52 where @xmath30 is the number of stas and @xmath53 is the throughput of the @xmath54 sta .",
    "the fairness index lies in the range 1 to @xmath55 .",
    "when one sta obtains all the capacity , the fairness index equals @xmath56 .",
    "if the fairness index is 1 , then all the stas achieve equal throughputs . in figure",
    "[ fig : fairness ] we compare the fairness performance of the eda policy with that of the others .",
    "it can be seen that the eda and available bandwidth based policies achieve comparable degrees of fairness , which are distinctly better than those achieved by the others .",
    "shows how the fairness index varies with increasing the load of centre ap in figure [ fig : ap9_shade ] ]",
    "we presented an association policy by considering tcp - controlled file downloads .",
    "this traffic constitutes a very substantial part of network traffic , as mentioned in @xcite .",
    "now let us consider simultaneous tcp uploads . in dcf ,",
    "a node s attempt behaviour is independent of packet length .",
    "if we interchange downlink data packets sent by aps with tcp - ack packets and uplink ack packets sent by stas with tcp data packets , the same analysis holds good for tcp - controlled file uploads .",
    "the next case arises when some stas are uploading and some stas are downloading files . here also our basic markov model of the number of stas with packets to send remains the same , if all the tcp windows are equal .",
    "even different window sizes can be taken care of by finding the probability that the packet at the head of the queue at the ap is for a particular sta .",
    "uncontrolled udp transfers bring changes in the model and results .",
    "apart from the above roaming is not addressed explicitly ; it can be considered as a departure from one ap and an arrival to another ap .",
    "we considered a noise free environment .",
    "introducing link errors by considering noisy environments may change the actual throughput compared to the one which we estimate before association . in our simulation and numerical evaluation",
    ", we used the 802.11b standard .",
    "however our mathematical expressions are independent of this standard ; hence the association policy can support @xmath57 different data rates .",
    "thus , we can apply the same scheme and analysis for 802.11g / n standards .",
    "we assumed small rtts , clearly , this needs to be generalized , and we are working on this at present .",
    "further , we considered exponentially distributed files with different mean sizes for different classes .",
    "as the bcmp network model supports file size distributions that are nonexponential also , our approach can accommodate these ; however , the details are to be worked out .",
    "we developed an sta - ap association policy geared towards tcp - controlled file downloads .",
    "our approach was based on extending a model for studying tcp - controlled infinitely long file transfers to the multirate wlan context , and incorporating the output from this in a 2-node closed - queueing network model for estimating finite file download times .",
    "the resulting policy showed considerable improvement over other policies , ranging from 12.8% better throughput compared to eva , up to 46.4% better throughput compared to simple rssi - based association for a 9-ap network .",
    "the association policy developed here is but an application of the models analyzed in earlier sections . the models and",
    "the analytical approach may find use in addressing other performance evaluation questions .",
    "for example , they could be used to address some `` what - if '' questions like : what would be the performance benefit that can be expected by a network upgrade that introduces a few new aps to of load the traffic from already - deployed congested aps ?",
