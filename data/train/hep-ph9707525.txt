    "<S> this cancellation between perturbative and nonperturbative ambiguities is in the same spirit as the analogous cancellation which occurs for infrared renormalons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus we learn that quarkonia energies have a nonperturbative contribution which scales with @xmath47 like eq .  </S>",
