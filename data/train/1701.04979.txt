    "in fact , the hybrid systems where itinerant electrons interact with the localized spins subject to strong geometrical frustrations have given rise to unconventional phase transitions and new states of matter@xcite .",
    "prominent among these new states are the topologically nontrivial states with non - zero spin scalar chirality@xcite .",
    "the chiral nature of these states breaks both parity and time - reversal symmetries .",
    "such non - coplanar spin orderings induce novel quantum phases and phenomena ( that are not observed for their coplanar or collinear counterparts ) such as the geometric or topological hall effect ( the ) where there is a hall conductivity even in the absence of an external applied magnetic field@xcite .",

    "the chiral spin orders have been studied theoretically in the context of kondo lattice model ( klm ) on frustrated lattices such as triangular@xcite , kagome@xcite , pyrocholre@xcite , face - centered cubic lattice@xcite and checkerboard lattice@xcite .",
    "our plan is to extend this study to the geometrically frustrated shastry - sutherland lattice ( ssl ) .",
    "this is not simply of academic interest .",
    "there exist a complete family of rare earth tetraborides , rb@xmath2 , ( r = tm , er , tb , dy , ho ) where there is a strong coupling between the itinerant electrons arising ( predominantly ) from the unfilled @xmath3 orbitals of the r@xmath4 ions and localized moments due to unfilled @xmath5 orbitals of the same . the r@xmath4 ions in these magnets are arranged in an ssl geometry , making the shastry - sutherland kondo lattice model ( ss - klm ) the ideal framework to understand the magnetic and electronic properties of this family of metallic quantum magnets .",
    "owing to the large number of parameters involved , the ss - klm is expected to have an extremely rich phase diagram with multiple competing ground state phases stabilized in different parameter regimes .",
    "our goal in this paper is to identify ranges of parameters that favor non - coplanar spin orderings . with that goal , and following previous studies on similar models@xcite , we explore the ground state phase diagram of this model with variational calculations and find out the parameters space where chiral spin phases are energetically favored . using a variational ansatz , we compare the energies for a variety of commonly observed ground state phases and determine the state with minimum energy .",
    "while such an approach may not always yield the true ground state , it is an effective way of identifying parameter regimes with maximum susceptibility towards the desired ground states .",
    "our results suggest that chiral spin arrangements are stabilized over a large range of parameters when we include the dm interaction .",
    "we have obtained a new non - coplanar _ canted - flux _ state which is stabilized not only for insulating phases but also for metallic phases .",
    "we study the kondo lattice model with additional dm and heisenberg exchange interactions on the geometrically frustrated ssl with classical localized spins .",
    "the total hamiltonian can be written as ,    @xmath6    the first two terms constitute the electronic part of the hamiltonian @xmath7 where we have a tight binding term for itinerant electron and an on - site kondo - like interaction between the spin of these electrons and localized moments .",

    "we have performed the above mentioned variational calculations on finite sized lattices while varying the parameters @xmath33 , @xmath11 , and strengths of heisenberg exchange interaction and dm vector .",
    "most of the results presented were obtained for a @xmath35 lattice , and they were verified on larger lattices at a few values of the parameters . since all the states have a periodicity of at most 2 unit cells , the results from the @xmath36 lattices were found to be adequate and no significant finite size effects were observed .",

    "this part of the phase diagram appears as a result of double exchange mechanism . for the current value of parameters an insulating afm ground state",
    "is realized around half filling .",
    "the afm interaction between localized spins at @xmath40 is favored as it minimizes the kinetic energy term for the itinerant electrons .",
    "the other coplanar states such as flux , stripe and 3:1 collinear also appear in phase diagram over quite wide range of number density and @xmath11 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction part we are interested in the phases with non - zero chirality which are absent in the fig .",
    "[ fig : nodm ] except some small patches for all - out and _ canted - flux _ states .",
    "the _ canted - flux _ is a new chiral phase that has not been observed earlier . at some places in the phase diagram the ground state",
    "has a volume which is mixture of different ordered states these regions are shown as phase separation ( ps ) in the figure @xcite .",
    "now we move our attention to what happens to phase diagram when we _",
    "switch on _ the dm interaction ?",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : withdm ] . clearly , dm interaction stabilizes the states that are non - coplanar in nature and that is why the regions where chiral states are realized becomes wider in size . in fact",
    "what we found out is that the _ canted - flux _ state is the one that now covers most part of the phase diagram .",
    "this chiral state driven by dm interaction replaces the afm at @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "we focus on this state at half filling where the system is in insulating phase .",
    "we found out that this phase is stabilized even at finite temperature .",
    "more details are presented in our paper where we dynamically reproduced this ground state starting from some random configurations of localized spins using mc method and discussed its evolution as a function of magnetic field@xcite .",
    "moreover , with the increase of the @xmath11 interaction the portions with _ canted - flux _ phase shrink and at very high value of @xmath11 around @xmath44 and @xmath43 what we get is a ps .",
    "fm phase appearing at small and high values of number density is robust against this dm interaction . among other coplanar states that still survive in the presence of dm interaction",
    "are stripe , 3:1 collinear and some portions of afm phase .",
    "next , we consider the _ other limit _ of the shastry - sutherland model where the strength of the interactions on the diagonal bonds is greater than the one on the axial bonds .",
    "the interest is driven by the fact that the system is in insulating state at @xmath45 and @xmath43 when a non - coplanar order is stabilized and if fermi level lies in one of these gaps then there is a possibility that we can realize the quantized the . fig .",

    "the localized spins on the ssl diagonals are antiparallel aligned ( singlet state ) same like for pure ssl model where ground state is a direct product of singlets on these ssl diagonal bonds in this limit . for small values of @xmath11 , a coplanar stripe state",
    "is observed at @xmath45 which changes to 3:1 collinear state at high values of @xmath11 .",
    "similarly , at @xmath50 the ground state is coplanar flux state at lower @xmath51 values and it is replaced by afm phase when @xmath11 increases in size .",
    "there are some regions of non - coplanar states such as all - out , 2-in 2-out , 3-in 1-out and _ canted - flux _ in the phase diagram but not at @xmath45 and @xmath43 .    in the last part of our calculations ,",

    "similar to what happened in the earlier case when we switched on the dm interaction here also the _ canted - flux _ becomes stabilized in the wider range of electron number density .",
    "in addition to @xmath41 , this phase is stabilized at @xmath45 and @xmath43 for small and large values of @xmath11 .",
    "currently , we are using an unbiased finite temperature mc method to investigate the stability of this phase against thermal fluctuations and also magnetic and transport properties while varying magnetic field .",
