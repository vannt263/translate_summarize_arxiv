    "supersymmetry is a natural solution to the gauge hierarchy problem that sets in for the standard model ( sm ) at the tev scale .",
    "thus if one supersymmetrizes the standard model particle spectra , one can build a model going past the tev scale yet consistent with all the successes of the standard model below 1 tev .",
    "if one continues such models to yet higher energies , one find the remarkable grand unification of the three gauge coupling constants at the gut scale @xmath12 gev , a result consistent with the lep data at the percent level .",
    "theoretical models which yield this unification arise naturally in supergravity ( sugra ) grand unification@xcite , and such models with r - parity invariance have the additional remarkable feature of predicting the existence of cold dark matter ( cdm)@xcite , the lightest neutralino @xmath13 , with a relic density amount comparable to what is observed .",
    "we discuss here some of the other consequences that might be expected of such sugra models .",
    "already existing experiments have begun to restrict the susy parameter space significantly .",
    "most significant of these are the amount of cdm , the higgs mass bound , the @xmath14 branching ratio , and ( possibly ) the muon @xmath15 anomaly .",
    "we start the discussion with the simplest model , msugra , with universal soft breaking parameters , and discuss additional signatures of susy that might be seen at accelerators , i.e. the @xmath16 decay at the tevatron , and the processes @xmath17 or @xmath18 at future linear colliders ( lc ) .",
    "we will then consider non - universal models ( with non - universal gaugino masses and non universal higgs soft breaking masses at @xmath19 ) to see how robust the msugra predictions are , and where non - universal soft breaking signals might reside .",
    "the msugra models@xcite depend on four extra parameters and one sign ( and as such is the most predictive of the susy models ) .",
    "we take these to be @xmath11 ( the universal scalar soft breaking mass at @xmath19 ) , @xmath10 ( the universal gaugino masses as @xmath19 ) , @xmath20 ( the cubic soft breaking mass at @xmath19 ) , @xmath21 ( at the electroweak scale ) , and the sign of the higgs mixing parameter @xmath22 ( which appears in the superpotential w as @xmath23 ) .",
    "we examine the parameter range @xmath24 , @xmath251 tev ( which corresponds to the lhc reach of @xmath26 tev ) , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "msugra makes predictions about two items involving dark matter : the neutralino - nucleus cross section being looked for by terrestrial detectors of dark matter from the milky way halo , and the mean amount of relic dark matter in the universe left over from the big bang . for detectors with heavy nuclei in their targets",
    ", the spin independent @xmath13-nucleus cross section dominates , which allows one to extract the @xmath29proton cross section @xmath30 .",
    "the basic quark diagrams here are the scattering through s - channel squarks , and t - channel cp even higgs bosons , @xmath31 and @xmath32 . for the relic density analysis",
    ", one must calculate the neutralino annihilation cross section in the early universe which proceeds through s channel @xmath33 and higgs poles ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath34 ) and t - channel sfermions .",
    "however , if a second particle becomes nearly degenerate with the @xmath13 , one must include it in the annihilation channels which leads to the phenomena of co - annihilation . in sugra models ,",
    "this accidental near degeneracy occurs naturally for the light stau , @xmath35 .",
    "one can see this qualitatively for low and intermediate tanbeta where one can solve the rge analytically .",
    "thus for the right selectron , @xmath36 , one finds @xmath37 for @xmath38 , the two become degenerate at @xmath39 gev , and co - annihilation thus begins at @xmath39 gev ( more precisely for the @xmath35 which is the lightest slepton ) . as @xmath10 increases , @xmath11 must increase ( to keep the @xmath35 heavier than the @xmath13 ) and one gets narrow bands of allowed regions in the @xmath0 plane for each @xmath1 and @xmath20 .",
    "one starts the analysis at the @xmath19 and uses the renormalization group equations ( rge ) to obtain predictions at the electroweak scale . in carrying out these calculation ,",
    "it is necessary to include a number of corrections and we list some of these here : ( 1 ) we use two loop gauge and one loop yukawa rge in running from @xmath19 to the electroweak scale @xmath40 , and three loop qcd rge below @xmath40 for light quark contributions .",
    "( 2 ) two loop and pole mass corrections are included in the calculation of @xmath41 .",
    "( 3 ) one loop correction to @xmath42 and @xmath43 are included@xcite ( 4 ) all stau - neutralino co - annihilation channels are included in the relic density calculation @xcite .",
    "( chargino - neutralino co - annihilation does not occur for @xmath44 tev . )",
    "large @xmath1 nlo susy corrections to @xmath2 are included@xcite .",
    "we do not include yukawa unifications or proton decay constraints as these depend sensitively on post - gut physics , about which little is known .",
    "( figadkm.epsf width 8 cm )    ( bsmm95cl.eps width 8 cm )    ( bsmmtgb50401.eps width 8 cm )    we use the following experimental input to constrain the susy parameter space : ( 1 ) global fits for the cmb and other astronomical measurements now restrict the amount of cdm considerably@xcite .",
    "we use here the range : @xmath45    the map data , due out perhaps early next year should be able to restrict this range considerably .",
    "\\(2 ) the lep lower bound @xmath46 gev@xcite , is a significant constraint for @xmath47 , and in fact an increase of three to five gev would cover most of the parameter space .",
    "unfortunately , however , the theoretical evaluation of @xmath48 still has an error of @xmath49gev , and so we interpret the lep bound to mean @xmath50 gev .",
    "\\(3 ) the cleo data for the decay @xmath14@xcite has both systematic and theoretical error , and so we use a relatively broad range for the branching ratio around the cleo central data : @xmath51 the @xmath14 rate produces a significant constraint for large tanbeta .",
    "\\(4 ) shortly after this conference , the brookhaven e821 experiment published new results of their measurement of the muon anomaly@xcite which reduced the statistical error by a factor of 2 ( and the systematic error somewhat ) .",
    "also new more accurate data from cmd-2 , bes , aleph and cleo have allowed a more accurate determination of the sm contribution to @xmath15 , and there have been two new evaluations of this @xcite ( see also talk by t. teubner at this conference ) . if the @xmath52 data is used to calculate the sm contribution , both groups find a 3@xmath4 deviation between experiment and the sm prediction e.g.@xcite @xmath53 on the other hand if the tau data of aleph and cleo are used ( with appropriate cvc breakdown corrections ) the deviation from the sm is reduced to only 1.6@xmath4 and the two evaluations are statistically inconsistent @xcite .",
    "the matter remains unclear as to which result is correct . in order to see the significance of eq .",
    "( 5 ) , we will here use this result , and assume a 2@xmath4 lower bound on delta @xmath15 exists and that this is attributable to susy .",
    "susy , in fact makes a significant contribution to @xmath15 , and if @xmath54 were @xmath55 , the squark and gluino mass spectrum would be pushed into the tev domain .    the combination of the @xmath41(for low @xmath1 ) and",

    "this means that most of the parmaeter space is in the @xmath57 co - annihilation domain , and hence in order to satisfy the cdm amount , @xmath11 is approximately determined by @xmath10 ( for fixed tanbeta , @xmath20 ) .",

    "before examining in more detail the effects of existing experiments on the susy parameter space , we discuss the @xmath6 decay at the tevatron and also examine susy signals that might survive at a linear collider .",
    "the @xmath6 opens an additional window at the tevatron for investigating the msugra parameter space@xcite .",
    "the sm predicts a very small branching ratio of b[@xmath6 ] = @xmath61 .",
    "further , the susy contribution can become quite large for large tanbeta , as the leading diagrams ( an example is given in fig .",
    "1 ) grow like @xmath62 and hence the branching ratio grows as @xmath63 .",
    "a set of cuts have been obtained eliminating background ( mostly gluon splitting @xmath64 and fakes ) @xcite leading to a sensitivity of b[@xmath6 ] @xmath65 for 15fb@xmath8 /detector .",
    "2 shows the sensitivity ( for a single detector ) as a function of luminosity , and fig .",
    "3 shows the expected msugra branching ratio for different @xmath1 for the example of @xmath66 , @xmath67gev .",
    "one see that the tevatron will be sensitive to this decay for @xmath68 .",
    "it is interesting to examine what possible susy signals of msugra a linear collider might see .",
    "we consider here two possibilities : @xmath69gev and @xmath70gev .",
    "we ve seen above that the @xmath41 and @xmath2 constraint already mean that @xmath71 gev , and so for msugra this means that gluinos and squarks would generally be beyond the reach of such machines ( as well as selectrons and smuons for a large part of the parameter space ) .",
    "the most favorable susy signals are then @xmath72 where @xmath73 or @xmath74 means any charged lepton .",
    "since for msugra one has that @xmath75 , the mass reach for these particle are @xmath76 @xmath77    there are a number of sm backgrounds that have to be considered to see if a clean signal remains .",
    "for example , ww production with decay into tau final states can be controlled by polarizing the beams .",
    "cuts to eliminate other possible backgrounds are under consideration@xcite .",
    "we now summarize the effects of the constraints from @xmath41 , @xmath2 , dark matter density and @xmath15 on the msugra parameter space , and also what might be expected from the @xmath6 observation at the tevatron and linear collider ( lc ) signals .",
    "4 exhibits the parameter space for @xmath78 , @xmath66 .",
    "one sees that the @xmath15 bound ( if valid ) combined with the @xmath41 bound and the relic density constraint leaves very little parameter space at low @xmath1 .",
    "either of the two linear collider signals could scan the full remaining space .",
    "the dark matter detection cross sections are of size that would be observable by the planned future dm detectors .",
    "5,6,7 for @xmath79 , @xmath66 , @xmath80 and -@xmath80 exhibit a larger allowed parameter space . the tevatron s @xmath6 covers the full allowed region for @xmath66 and - @xmath81 , and about half the space for @xmath82 . in each case , the nlc at 500gev can only cover a part of the parameter space .",
    "we note that the stau - stau lc signal extends to high @xmath10 and relatively low @xmath11 , while the @xmath83 signal can cover large @xmath11 but limited @xmath10 . in view of the nature of the allowed dm channel ,",
    "the former is of more significance . at very high @xmath1 ,",
    "a bulge in the dm allowed channel develops at low @xmath10 due to the fact the heavy higgs ( @xmath34,@xmath32 ) become light , allowing a rapid early universe annihilation through the @xmath34 and @xmath32 s - channel diagrams .",
    "this is shown most dramatically in fig . 8 for @xmath84 , @xmath85 . here",
    "even the 800 gev lc can not cover the full parameter space , though the tevatron signal of @xmath6 would be observable over the full parameter space .",
    "we examine next some sugra models with non - universal soft breaking to see what aspects of the results of sec . 4 are maintained .",
    "we consider specifically the case of non - universal gaugino masses and non - universal higgs soft breaking masses at mg .",
    "two striking effects in msugra are the @xmath86 co - annihilation channel which leads to a narrow band in the @xmath87 plane of allowed relic density , and the fact that the combined effects of @xmath2 and the @xmath41 bounds require @xmath88 ( i.e. @xmath89gev ) .",
    "the possibility of non - universal gaugino masses at @xmath19 can relax significantly the constraints of @xmath2 and @xmath41 . thus if the gluino mass is increased , it effects the stop mass which has major effects on both @xmath2 and @xmath41 .",
    "for example , a gluino mass which is twice the universal value at @xmath19 reduces the lower bound on @xmath90 to 75gev ( @xmath91gev ) and also @xmath92 to @xmath93gev , making these particles more accessible . on the other hand ,",
    "the near degeneracy between @xmath35 and @xmath13 remains , since this depends mainly on the u(1 ) gaugino mass @xmath94 .",
    "non - universality in the higgs masses at @xmath19 , i. e. @xmath95 , can also produce new effects .",
    "while this introduces two additional parameters into the model , one can understand their effects since @xmath96 controls much of the physics .",
    "thus if @xmath96 decreases , the higgsino content of the neutralino increases and this has two effects : it increases the @xmath97 coupling and also @xmath30 . to see what effects occur qualitatively",
    ", we note that for small and intermediate @xmath1 the rge can be solved analytically and give @xmath98m_0 ^ 2\\ ] ] where @xmath99 , @xmath100 .",
    "a positive @xmath101 then decreases @xmath96 while @xmath96 is relatively insensitive to @xmath102 .",
    "9 exhibits the allowed relic density regions for the case of @xmath103 , @xmath79 , @xmath104 .",
    "one sees that a new region of allowed relic density arises for small @xmath10 and large @xmath11 from the increased annihilation through the @xmath33 s - channel .",
    "( the usual @xmath105 co - annihilation region is present also . )",
    "this region is mostly unobservable at a 500gev nlc .",
    "10 shows the corresponding dm cross sections .",
    "the z - channel region can increase @xmath30 by a factor of 10 or more .",
    "( tanbeta40collo1non.eps width 8 cm )    ( adhs4.epsf width 10 cm )",
    "we have discussed here the current restrictions on the susy parameter space from existing experiments and what may be obtained from future experiments at the tevatron ( from the @xmath6 decay ) and from linear colliders ( using @xmath106 and @xmath83 signals ) .",
    "we have examined msugra models and also non - universal sugra models",
    ".    for msugra one finds the @xmath105 co - annihilation limits the allowed parameter space to a narrow band except for large @xmath1 .",
    "the combined @xmath2 and @xmath41 bounds then requires @xmath107120gev , forbidding a light neutralino .",
    "the tevatron with 15 fb@xmath8/detector luminosity could scan almost the entire parameter space for @xmath108 ( if @xmath109 ) using the @xmath6 decay .",
    "a linear collider at 800gev can scan almost all the parameter space , though a 500 gev machine would miss much of the parameter space for large @xmath1 .",
    "dark matter detection cross sections are all within the range of sensitivity for planned detectors ( i.e. @xmath110 pb ) .",
