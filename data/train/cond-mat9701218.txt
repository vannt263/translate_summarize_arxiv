    "the effect of strong thermal fluctuations on the flux lines is an important aspect of the physics of high-@xmath0 superconductors in the mixed state .",
    "it is believed that these fluctuations melt the ground - state flux - line lattice into a vortex - line liquid below @xmath0 @xcite .    in nelson s analogy of vortex lines with world lines of 2d bosons @xcite",
    ", the absence of superfluidity of the bosons corresponds to the presence of superconducting coherence along the field direction in the vortex - line system @xcite .",
    "the liquid phase without longitudinal superconductivity ( sometimes referred to as an  entangled vortex liquid \" ) corresponds to the 2d boson superfluid state .",
    "similarly , the vortex - line liquid with longitudinal superconductivity (  disentangled vortex liquid \" ) corresponds to the normal liquid state of the 2d bosons .",
    "the quantity corresponding to the inverse 2d - boson temperature in the vortex - line system is the system size @xmath1 along the field direction .",
    "therefore , for a small enough @xmath1 , nelson s analogy predicts longitudinal superconducting coherence in the vortex liquid . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been argued that the disentangled vortex liquid exists as a true thermodynamic phase @xmath2 , at least for the case where the distance between the vortex lines is ( much ) smaller than the magnetic penetration depth @xmath3 .",
    "the scenario in which the longitudinal superconductivity is destroyed already within the vortex - lattice phase , leading to a  supersolid \" phase , has been considered in @xcite .",
    "there exists a substantial recent literature that deals with mc simulations of the vortex - line phases , using various model approximations @xcite .",
    "in two recent papers , in which the vortex - line system was studied within lattice london models @xcite , opposite conclusions have been reached regarding the presence of longitudinal superconductivity within the vortex - liquid phase for systems with @xmath4 lattice constants .",
    "although in both works cited , the longitudinal coherence was argued to exist only over a finite length scale ( and therefore no true disentangled vortex - liquid phase was claimed to exist ) , a difference of two orders of magnitude in the results for this length scale translates into opposite predictions for the experimentally observable behavior in typical samples studied in recent flux - transformer experiments , for temperatures above but close to melting .",
    "one of the motivations of our work has been to clarify the reason(s ) for the above disagreement .",
    "on the one hand , chen and teitel @xcite , who perform the monte carlo simulation at constant magnetic induction @xmath5 , found that longitudinal superconductivity persists far into the vortex liquid for @xmath6 lattice constants .",
    "these authors argue that the length scale beyond which the vortex lines become entangled , corresponds to approximately 410 lattice constants . for ybco",
    "this length scale for longitudinal coherence was estimated in @xcite to be much larger than the thickness of the samples studied in recent flux - transformer experiments @xcite . as a result",
    ", their findings suggest the existence of a temperature regime in these experiments , in which the vortex lattice has melted but in which the flux motion is still maximally @xmath7-correlated , in agreement with the results obtained for twinned ybco samples @xcite . on the other",
    "hand carneiro @xcite found evidence for the disappearance of the vortex - liquid regime with disentangled lines already between @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "these results were argued to agree with later experiments on untwinned ybco samples , in which the flux - line lattice melting and a loss of maximally @xmath7-correlated vortex motion was found to coincide .    in carneiro",
    "s calculations the longitudinal response is calculated in a different way , discussed in more detail below , in which fluctuations in the net vorticities ( in two directions ) are allowed . in a recent comment @xcite , chen and teitel",

    "they suggested that it effectively measures the transverse instead of the longitudinal response .",

    "we present a direct comparison of the two different calculational schemes , and will point out that the method of ref .",
    "@xcite has some serious problems .    from our results",
    "we conclude that the isotropic lattice london model predicts a temperature regime in which longitudinal coherence over long length scales exists within the vortex - liquid phase .",

    "the first mc study of the lattice london model was performed by carneiro , cavalcanti and gartner @xcite .",
    "the model was explored further by carneiro for a superconductor with free surfaces @xcite .",
    "the lattice london model is formulated directly in terms of the vortex degrees of freedom .",
    "the vortex lines are modeled as consisting of elements of unit length based at dual lattice sites of a cubic lattice . at every dual lattice site",
    "we define three integers @xmath10 , the vorticities in the directions @xmath11 .",

    "the hamiltonian of the isotropic lattice london model , expressed in terms of the vorticities , is given by : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the london interaction with fourier components @xmath20 where @xmath21 ( @xmath22 @xmath23 ) and @xmath24 .",

    "@xmath26 is the anisotropy parameter , with @xmath3 and @xmath27 the magnetic penetration depths along the @xmath28-@xmath29 plane and the @xmath7 axis , respectively , and @xmath30 the lattice constant .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) can be either derived from the discrete version of the london free energy @xcite or by a duality transformation of the hamiltonian of a villain - type lattice superconductor @xcite .",
    "monte carlo sampling of the phase space for the variables @xmath31 at constant @xmath5 is performed as follows .",
    "the initial configuration is prepared to contain the number of vortex lines we want to study , depending on the value chosen for the magnetic induction @xmath5 .",
    "a monte carlo update step consists of adding at a given site a closed @xmath32 square loop of unit vorticity with an orientation chosen randomly from the six possible ones .",
    "the addition of a closed loop preserves the constraint ( [ constraint ] ) .",
    "the standard metropolis algorithm is employed to accept or reject the new configuration . obviously , when only closed loops are added , the magnetic induction @xmath5 with components @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) will be constant throughout the simulation .    to probe superconducting coherence",
    "one can consider the helicity moduli introduced by chen and teitel @xcite @xmath35 . here",
    "@xmath36 is the linear response coefficient between a perturbation @xmath37 of the external vector potential and the induced supercurrent @xmath38 where @xmath39 ( london gauge ) . for our lattice london model",

    "if @xmath48 , one has a perfect screening of the corresponding perturbation of the vector potential , and thus longitudinal superconducting coherence . a sharp jump in @xmath49 from unity is interpreted as loss of longitudinal coherence . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that @xmath49 will be non - zero as long as the vortex - line system retains a finite shear modulus at finite wave vector .",

    "@xcite that helical instabilities of the vortex lines driven by a longitudinal current , can be stabilized either by pinning or by a finite shear modulus .    in the mc calculations , @xmath50 is estimated from the quantity @xmath51 at small @xmath52 . in ref .",
    "@xcite this was done by extrapolation of the results for @xmath53 to @xmath54 using a fit to a polynomial in @xmath55 .",
    "it turns out that such a fit does not work for higher values of @xmath56 and/or @xmath57 than considered in @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite this has been demonstrated for @xmath58 .",
    "however , this problem disappears if one examines the full ratio that defines @xmath59 ( see eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) ) .",
    "this quantity has only a weak dependence on @xmath52 @xcite , so that one already obtains a reliable estimate for @xmath60 from the data point for the smallest nonzero wave vector , @xmath61 .",
    "this direct way of estimating the response was employed before in ref .",
    "@xcite . we illustrate it with an example in figs .",
    "10 and 11 . in particular , @xmath62 is almost independent of @xmath63 ( when @xmath5 is along @xmath7 )",

    "@xcite , a different set up was introduced for measuring longitudinal superconducting coherence .",
    "this original set up starts from the observation that _ at a free boundary _",
    "parallel to the @xmath29-@xmath7 plane , superconducting coherence in the @xmath7 direction corresponds to meissner shielding of an infinitesimal uniform applied field in the @xmath29 direction @xcite . for a lattice london model in the form of a slab , with fbc in the @xmath28 direction and pbc in the other directions , and in a constant _ applied _ magnetic field ,",

    "when @xmath65 is nonzero , this is interpreted as a loss of longitudinal superconductivity .",

    "@xcite , uses the vortex - vortex interaction @xmath76 for a system with periodic boundary conditions in all directions , but updates at sites in the planes @xmath77 and @xmath78 as if these planes were ( adjacent to ) free boundaries , allowing the addition of closed elementary loops parallel to the @xmath29-@xmath7 plane and of incomplete loops parallel to the @xmath28-@xmath29 and @xmath28-@xmath7 planes .",
    "the periodic boundary conditions are imposed also in the @xmath28 direction ( through the form of @xmath76 ) to diminish finite size effects .",
    "although @xmath77 and @xmath78 are therefore no genuine free boundaries , carneiro has claimed that the addition of incomplete loops incorporates the essence needed for the calculation of @xmath65 .",

    "<S> we study the vortex - line lattice and liquid phases of a clean type - ii superconductor by means of monte carlo simulations of the lattice london model . motivated by a recent controversy regarding the presence , within this model , of a vortex - liquid regime with longitudinal superconducting coherence over long length scales , </S>",
    "<S> we directly compare two different ways to calculate the longitudinal coherence . for an isotropic superconductor , </S>",
    "<S> we interpret our results in terms of a temperature regime within the liquid phase in which longitudinal superconducting coherence extends over length scales larger than the system thickness studied . </S>",
    "<S> we note that this regime disappears in the moderately anisotropic case due to a proliferation , close to the flux - line lattice melting temperature , of vortex loops between the layers .    2 </S>"
