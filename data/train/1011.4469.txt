    "high - temperature superconductivity has been a widely pursued subject for condensed matter physicists for over two decades .",
    "there are several classes of materials where unconventional superconductivity is found : cuprates whose highest t@xmath2 s remain unrivaled , the recently discovered and intensively studied iron pnictides , na@xmath3coo@xmath4 intercalated with h@xmath4o , babio@xmath5 doped by k , the pu - based `` 115 '' heavy fermion series , and the transition metal nitride halide  mnx ( m = zr , hf ; x = cl , br , i ) .",
    "mnx crystallizes in two structures , labeled @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the zr and hf members were found to be superconducting with unprecedented critical temperatures for nitrides ( 15k , 25k ) in the @xmath8-structure , which is isostructural to smsi , and contains double - honeycomb layers of alternating m and n atoms @xcite .",
    "the sister compound tincl with @xmath6-structure has now been discovered to superconduct ( 16k ) as well.@xcite    based on many examples now , layered structures seem to favor high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "the reduced dimensionality promotes various instabilities associated with fermi surface nesting . due to electron - electron interactions , many parent compounds of htscs exhibit long - range magnetic order , such as antiferromagnetism ( afm ) in cuprates and iron pnictides .",
    "the afm order needs to be destroyed upon doping , by electrons or by holes , to open the way for superconductivity .",
    "this is not the case for non - magnetic mnx , which are band insulators with a band gap of @xmath9 ev , and the transition metal @xmath10 states make up most of the lower conduction bands @xcite",
    ".    both the @xmath6- and @xmath7-polymorphs are quasi-2d structures with large interlayer spacing and weak van der waals coupling between layers .",
    "when doped with electrons , a@xmath11mnx ( a being alkali metals ) remains insulating at low concentration , then suddenly become superconducting at about @xmath12 in hfncl and @xmath13 in zrncl , and maintain a relatively constant t@xmath2 up to @xmath14 [ ] .",
    "the superconducting transition temperature can be as high as @xmath15 k , discovered in li@xmath11(thf)@xmath16hfncl @xcite .",
    "it has also been found that t@xmath2 may be correlated with the interlayer spacing , which can be tuned by intercalation of different sized molecules @xcite .",
    "also , the electron doping can be substituted by ion vacancy of the cl atoms with similar superconductivity being found @xcite . in a theoretical treatment by bill _",
    "_ , the dynamical screening of electronic interactions in these materials was modeled@xcite by conducting sheets spaced by dielectrics.@xcite a fully open large superconducting gap without nodes was observed with tunneling spectroscopy .",
    "@xcite    experimental observations from several perspectives confirm that mnx are not electron - phonon bcs superconductors : ( 1 ) measured isotope effects are small;@xcite ( 2 ) specific heat measurementslixzrncl - spheat indicate a small mass enhancement factor ; ( 3 ) the density of states at the fermi level is small ( when electron doped ) , and t@xmath2 is almost independent of the doping level in the range @xmath17 . as a feature peculiar to this system , t@xmath0 actually increases as the metal - insulator transition at @xmath18=0.06 is approached , rather than following the common dome shape with doping .",
    "linear response calculations also agree on the small electron - phonon coupling constant @xcite that can not account for the observed t@xmath2 .",
    "the impressive high transition temperatures and easy tunability of carrier concentrations ( and sometimes effective dimensionality ) suggest there is potential to reach higher t@xmath2 in this class.@xcite    the possible candidates of pairing mechanism responsible for the observed high t@xmath2 are spin and charge fluctuations , which have been discussed by both experimentalists and theorists , but opinions remain controversial .",
    "the specific heat measurement on li@xmath11zrncl is suggestive of relatively strong coupling superconductivity , based on the observed large gap ratio and specific jump@xcite at t@xmath0 .",
    "the inter - layer spacing dependence of t@xmath2 reveals the close relation between the pairing interaction and topology of the fermi surface @xcite , implying a spin and/or charge induced superconductivity .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility measurement of heavily doped li@xmath11(thf)@xmath16hfncl indicates low carrier density and negligible mass enhancement factor , in favor of charge fluctuations over the spin fluctuations.li(thf)hfncl-x-expt    a detailed measurement of the doping dependence of specific heat and magnetic susceptibility has been performed on li@xmath11zrncl and the data were compared with calculations based on a model hamiltonian lixzrncl - xs - expt , kuroki - flex , which shows correlation between t@xmath2 and magnetic susceptibility .",
    "some change is occurring that affects both , but a causal relationship has not been established .",
    "there have been several band structure calculations for zrncl and hfncl that provide the basis for more specific studies , mostly in the superconducting @xmath7-structure.@xcite    recently , yamanaka _ et al _ @xcite reported superconductivity in the alkali metal intercalated @xmath19-tincl , with t@xmath2 up to @xmath20 k. this is the first mnx compound found to be superconducting in the @xmath19-structure .",
    "the lack of fermi surface nesting in @xmath19-li@xmath11tincl seems to exclude large magnetic fluctuations , and its low carrier density character is indicative of charge fluctuations as a more likely driving force .",

    "the generators of pmmn are two simple reflections @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and the non - symmorphic reflection @xmath30 followed by a ( @xmath31 translation .    the ti - n net within tincl is topologically equivalent to that of a single nacl layer .",
    "there is strong buckling this ti - n net perpendicular to the @xmath32 direction , such that neighboring chains which are directed along @xmath33 differ in height .",
    "these chains are themselves somewhat buckled , all of this leading to the placement of ti ions @xmath340.8   from the average height , and n ions @xmath340.4   from the average height .",
    "the ti ions are two - fold coordinated by cl ions lying in the @xmath35 plane ; the breaking of square symmetry of the tin layer by its strong buckling , can be regarded as `` due to '' this positioning of the cl ions .    finally , each ti is six - fold coordinated by four n and two cl atoms .",
    "the two ti - n bonds have very close lengths of @xmath36   and @xmath37  , respectively , though the n ions lie at different heights in the @xmath38 and @xmath39 directions .",

    "the ti - ti distance is @xmath42   , not much larger than that of ti - n due to the buckled layer structure , so in the tight - binding model we construct in the next section , the hoppings between ti sites are also important .",

    "with our model just constructed , we calculate the spin and charge susceptibilities .",
    "the model is a multi - band extended hubbard model on a 2d rectangular lattice with 4 sites ( two ti and two n ) per unit cell . for the on - site interaction terms , we use @xmath77 ev , @xmath78 ev , and @xmath79 ev .",
    "these values are somewhat smaller than might be used in a traditional hubbard model calculation ; this is partly to compensate for the fact that rpa has a tendency to overestimate the strength of the interaction due to the lack of the self - energy correction.@xcite moreover , we are using wfs rather than atomic orbitals , for which the extension onto neighboring sites will suppress the intra - atomic interactions @xmath80 and @xmath68 .    for inter - site interactions ,",
    "we assume @xmath81 to be spin and orbital independent , and that it only depends on the distance between the two sites .",
    "taking into account the ti - n and ti - ti distances mentioned above , we use @xmath82 ev ( nearest neighbor ) , @xmath83 ev ( 2nd nearest neighbor ) .",
    "since the wannier functions have contributions from neighboring sites , it is reasonable to set the inter - site coulomb repulsion @xmath48 slightly larger than traditionally used for atomic orbitals .",

    "the inter - site coulomb interaction can give rise to charge fluctuation , creating collective electron motion and possible charge ordering .",
    "competition between on - site and inter - site interaction of @xmath10 electrons can lead in principle to a frustration of both spin and charge ordering .",
    "the hybridization between @xmath10 and @xmath21 orbitals opens another channel , that of a charge transfer instability .",
    "one of the interesting questions is whether some combination of these processes can create excitations that can pair up electrons , analogous to the behavior found in a @xmath10-@xmath94 model in the limit of infinite @xmath47 and nearest neighbor hybridization @xcite .    in figure",

    "the anisotropic behavior of @xmath105 ( on - site , @xmath106 ) comes from the orthorhombic symmetry of the lattice , i.e. @xmath107 , which brings in anisotropic @xmath53-dependence , in this case strongly so . the spin fluctuations between @xmath10 and @xmath21 orbitals",
    "@xmath108 have a sizable overall magnitude , comparable to @xmath109 fluctuation , but small variation with @xmath53 , because four neighboring n atoms have almost the same distance to ti .",
    "due to the lack of fermi surface nesting , there is no divergent behavior in the spin susceptibility , presenting different physics from the @xmath8-hfncl which has two circular fermi surfaces located at two high - symmetry ( k ) points in the bz which can provide near perfect nesting .",
    "representative charge susceptibilities are shown in figure [ fig : xc ] .",
    "often they have similiarities to the spin susceptibilities , with comparable but somewhat smaller magnitudes .",
    "it is known that in an extended hubbard model on a square lattice , at zero frequency , @xmath110 and @xmath111 have similar @xmath53-dependence and only vary in magnitude.@xcite without the long - range coulomb interaction , charge fluctuation will always be smaller than spin fluctuation because of the different signs in the rpa formula .",
    "the difference between @xmath110 and @xmath111 will become more apparent at non - zero @xmath112 .",
    "the @xmath53-dependence of @xmath111 is similar to that of @xmath110 but shows somewhat more structure in @xmath113 .",
    "note that the magnitude of @xmath113 is only half that of @xmath103 .",
    "the spin and charge fluctuations within the n @xmath21-channel are very small since the @xmath21 orbitals are fully occupied so fluctuations only happen as a second order effect .",
    "however , the presence of the n @xmath21 band very close to the lowest @xmath10 conduction band opens an additional channel for fluctuations between them ( @xmath114 , fig .",
    "[ fig : xs]c and @xmath115 , fig .",

    ", we show the macroscopic susceptibilities in figure [ fig : xmac ] .",
    "the imprint of @xmath93 is evident . beyond @xmath93 ,",
    "the susceptibilities decrease slightly and with ( near ) square symmetry . inside @xmath93 ,",
    "the variation is greater and displays the rectangular symmetry of the lattice .",
    "the overall spin enhancement of the macroscopic susceptibility ( @xmath116 ) near @xmath117 is about @xmath118 . for the model with the realistic parameters considered here ,",
    "our test calculations show that @xmath110 will approach divergent behavior when @xmath119 ev . since tincl has wide @xmath41 bands , it is unphysical to use @xmath47 anywhere near @xmath120 ev ( we are using 1.5 ev ) , so strong spin fluctuation is unlikely to occur in this material .",
    "the macroscopic charge susceptibility has smaller magnitude and @xmath53-dependence , but will show divergent behavior when inter - site interaction @xmath48 is much larger than @xmath47 , but that regime is unrealistic for the case studied here .",
    "overall , both spin and charge susceptibilities show moderate enhancements compared to the bare susceptibility , without any approach to an instability toward spin or charge ordering .",
    "to conclude , we have constructed a many - body extended hubbard model using a realistic band structure obtained from density functional theory calculations .",
    "rpa is applied to obtain the spin and charge susceptibilities . in a system like @xmath1-tincl , where the crucial ingredients of high - temperature superconductivity , such as strong electron - phonon coupling and good fermi surface nesting , seem to be missing , spin and charge fluctuations are the remaining candidates .",
    "our calculations show that the spin and charge enhancements of susceptibilities , both intra - band and inter - band , are small due to moderate correlations",
    ". however , spin and charge fluctuations can produce substantial values possibly capable of encouraging electrons to pair .",
    "although spin fluctuations are present in @xmath19-tincl , it is worth pointing out that the physics is very different from the @xmath8-structure counterparts even though both are nonmagnetic , and apparently distinct from the recently discovered fe pnictides where magnetism is an important feature in parent compounds .",
    "as the nonmagnetic nature of tincl and other mnx materials indicates , as well as seen from the results from our rpa calculation , charge fluctuations may have an important role in superconductivity in these systems .",
    "overall , we still do not have a clear understanding of how superconductivity arises from the fluctuations , as with all other high - tc families .",
    "the authors would like to thank k. kuroki and r. t. scalettar for helpful discussions on the technical details of the rpa calculations .",
