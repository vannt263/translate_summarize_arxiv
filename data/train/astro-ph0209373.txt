    "the planck  esa mission will perform a high - angular resolution mapping of the microwave sky over a wide range of frequencies , from 30 to 900 ghz .",
    "these data will have important implications on different fields , from cosmology and fundamental physics to galactic and extragalactic astrophysics .",
    "the solar system astronomy will also benefit from the planck mission since it will offer the opportunity to perform a survey of solar system objects at millimetric wavelengths .",
    "planck will be sensitive to the millimetric emissions from planets and from a significant fraction of the asteroidal population . in this paper",
    "we focus on the detection of asteroid radio emissions and on the identification of the asteroidal targets that will be observed during the mission .",
    "the relevant parameters for the possible detection of a minor body by planck are the geocentric distance and the diameter .",
    "we will concentrate in this paper on main belt asteroids that can be more easily detected since their orbits are at relatively small geocentric distances and several objects have diameter larger than 50  km .",
    "+ radio observations of asteroids from the earth were performed by at seven different frequencies ranging from 150 to 870 ghz .",
    "redman focused on the information that radio data can give to the thermal models of asteroids .",
    "their set of targets included 5 asteroids already observed by and two new objects . observed , at 250 ghz , 15 among the largest asteroids , but only to determine the diameter and to compare their measurements with other methods . + the emissivity obtained at radio frequencies may probe the temperature of the body at different depths on the surface allowing to derive precise values of the average temperature .",
    "moreover , relevant physical data concerning the density of the regolith layer covering the surface of the asteroids can also be determined .",
    "+ radio observations of asteroids by planck offer a unique opportunity to improve our knowledge on the thermal emission in the millimetric and submillimetric domain , increasing our knowledge of the physical nature of the surface layers of the objects . considering that radio data provide an estimate of the density on a scale related to the wavelength of the observations",
    ", the advantage of using planck will be in the possibility of gathering data on a large frequency spectrum and then to probe the temperature and regolith density at different depths below the surface .",
    "+ furthermore , the planck data can help to refine the thermophysical models using also physical studies of the thermal properties of stony and feni meteorites as well as inferences about surface physical properties derived from asteroid radar studies",
    ". it will be possible to relate the planck data to the two standard models which are commonly invoked to predict the thermal radiation from asteroids , considering the asteroid as a nonrotating sphere or a rapidly rotating sphere .",
    "+ for instance vesta has been observed on a wide range of wavelengths , from submillimeter to centimeter , and the ratio of the observed flux , at each wavelength ( from 12@xmath1 m to 6 cm ) , divided by the flux expected from a blackbody at the temperature of a nonrotating asteroid shows a behavior different from the standard models @xcite . a successful model for the thermal emission must explain why the apparent flux remains below the rapidly rotating sphere value , and much below the nonrotating sphere value , over the entire submillimeter range .",
    "several mechanisms can lower the apparent temperature at radio wavelengths as reflections at the outer surface of the regolith , reduction in the actual temperature of the deeper layers of the regolith due to diurnal temperature variations at the surface , or scattering by grains within the regolith which can reduce the emissivity in a wavelength dependent fashion .",
    "the actual emission from an asteroid may combine all three effects in differing amounts at each wavelength , but only very few objects have been observed in the submillimeter and millimeter range and it is not possible to identify a typical behavior or to relate the results to different asteroid taxonomic classes . +",
    "it is worth to point out that the main belt asteroids may represent a source of background for the planck mission and , as a consequence , they should be considered in the definition of the scientific and technical aspects of the mission .",
    "+ the thermal emission of asteroids , apart from their intrinsic scientific relevance , has also to be considered as a potential source of spurious detections in the analysis of galactic or extragalactic sources .",
    "the precise determination at each epoch of the eventual presence of an asteroid , with its point emission , in some of the planck beams is a critical requirement to avoid systematic errors in mapping the astrophysical sources of radiation .",
    "the high nominal accuracy of the planck instruments suggests a tight control even for the contamination from asteroids below the detection threshold .",
    "+ section  2 is devoted to the discussion of the planck sensitivity for the detection of moving sources at different frequency channels .",
    "the averaged final planck sensitivities will be rescaled in order to take into account the positions of the different antenna beams in the telescope field of view and the main properties of the planck scanning strategy .",
    "these results are used in section  3 to determine the threshold to detect asteroids in the planck data streams , according to their typical temperature and size . in section  4",
    ", we describe our numerical code to compute the asteroid transits on the different planck beams and to estimate their signals",
    ". the results of this analysis are presented in section  5 .",
    "finally , we discuss the results and draw our main conclusions in section  6 .",
    "the planck surveyor will observe the sky at nine frequencies with two instruments having different angular resolutions and sensitivities : the low frequency instrument ( lfi ) that covers the range 30 - 100 ghz , and the high frequency instrument ( hfi ) that covers the range 143 - 857 ghz . in table  1",
    "we report the relevant parameters for both lfi and hfi ( see columns 1 , 4 and 5 ) .",
    "the relative bandwidths of the lfi and hfi are respectively @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( see column 2 of table 1 ) . +    .instrumental performances and confusion noise estimates for planck lfi .",
    "the bandwidths are 20% for the lfi channels and",
    "25% for the hfi ones . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the planck esa mission will perform a high - angular resolution mapping of the microwave sky over a wide range of frequencies , from 30 to 900 ghz . during the two years planned for",
    "the mission the surveyor will frame a large number of main - belt asteroids . in this paper",
    "we investigate in detail for the first time the possibility for planck to detect main - belt asteroids .",
    "the main parameter in the asteroid detection process by the planck horns is the @xmath4  ratio .",
    "the instrumental sensitivity to such objects has then been defined as the minimum @xmath4  value required to safely observe them .",
    "this value is given by the planck sensitivity at different frequencies rescaled to take into account the integration time and the confusion noise due to the background .",
    "an accurate evaluation of the noises and the sensitivity degradation , related to the high proper motion of the asteroids , yielded a minimum @xmath4 ratio of @xmath5 . + a numerical simulation of a two - years mission has been performed in order to estimate the number of objects whose @xmath6  is greater than about @xmath7  and that will then be observed by planck .",
    "the simulation uses updated catalogs for the orbital elements of the main - belt asteroids and their diameters .",
    "the orbit of each asteroid has been integrated with a very short timestep to compute the relative position of the body with respect to the planck horns and the value of @xmath6 .",
    "an accurate mission simulation has been obtained . up to 397 asteroids",
    "are expected to be detected in the various planck channels ( table 3 ) .",
    "detectable asteroids will appear in about 30% of the total sky circles scanned by the mission .",
    "+ the previous survey of main belt asteroids was performed by the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) on 1983 in four wavelength bands centered near 12 , 25 , 60 and 100@xmath1 m , much lower than the minimum wavelength observed by planck of 350@xmath1 m , corresponding to the highest frequency of 857 ghz .",
    "it surveyed approximately 96% of the sky and 2228 different multiply observed asteroids were associated to iras sources @xcite , providing a good estimate of diameter and albedo for most of them .",
    "+ iras s 12@xmath1 m limiting sensitivity , for s / n=3 , was about 150 mjy @xcite , and assuming a main belt asteroid as a black body at 150 k this flux can be translated to about 56 mjy at 350@xmath1 m ( 857 ghz ) , well below the planck noises reported in table 2 . +",
    "planck will provide flux measurements for a smaller sample of asteroids ( @xmath8 objects ) compared to iras , but at different wavelengths , almost unexplored for this class of solar system objects .",
    "this will improve our understanding of the thermal emission and the related surface properties of asteroids .",
