    "in the conventional approach , the inclusive @xmath0 productions in various high energy processes have been studied in the framework of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) and the color singlet model @xcite . in this model",

    "however , this approach , when applied to the @xmath0 or @xmath5 production at the tevatron , severely underestimates the productions rate @xcite . in order to reconcile the data and pqcd predictions , a new mechanism for heavy quarkonium productions has been suggested @xcite , the color - octet gluon fragmentation into @xmath0 . also , the color - octet mechanism in heavy quarkonium productions at hadron colliders through the color - octet @xmath6 pair in various partial wave states @xmath7 has been considered beyond the color - octet gluon fragmentation approach @xcite , @xcite . in refs .",

    "it is important to test this idea in other high energy processes with inclusive heavy quarkonium productions . up to now , the following processes have been considered : @xmath0 production at the tevatron and fixed target experiments @xcite @xcite @xcite , spin alignment of the color - octet produced @xmath0 @xcite , the polar angle distribution of the @xmath0 in the @xmath20 annihilations into @xmath21 @xcite , inclusive @xmath0 production in @xmath22 meson decays @xcite , the @xmath23 decays at lep @xcite @xcite , and @xmath0 photoproductions at the fixed target experiments as well as at hera @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "these processes also depend on the aforementioned three color - octet matrix elements in different combinations from ( 1.4 ) .",
    "thus , one can check if the color - octet mechanism provides reasonable agreements between pqcd and the experimental data on inclusive @xmath0 production rates from these processes .    in this talk , i review two applications of the idea of the color - octet @xmath0 productions , which i was working on , among many recent applications mentioned above .",

    "the situation is the same for @xmath83 .",
    "this is problematic , unless this large color - octet contributions are canceled by the color - singlet contributions of higher order in @xmath58 which were not included in ref .",
    "if there are no such fortuitous cancelations among various color - octet and the color - singlet contributions , this disaster could be attributed to the relation ( 1.4 ) being too large compared to the naive velocity scaling rule in nrqcd , as noticed in ref .",
    "it seems to be crucial to include the higher order corrections of @xmath84 for the color - singlet @xmath0 productions at the tevatron , which is still lacking in the literature .",

    "we briefly summarize both types of corrections here , since they have to be included in principle for consistency , when one includes the color - octet mechanism in many cases .",

    "they found that relativistic corrections are important for high @xmath112 at emc energy ( @xmath113 gev ) .",

    "another consequence of the radiative corrections to the color - singlet @xmath0 photoproduction is that the pqcd becomes out of control for @xmath112 at emc energy . for hera ,",

    "the @xmath115 factor is approximately @xmath123 both at hera and the fixed target experiments .",

    "we consider the process where only the gluon is off - shell .",

    "it is timely to recall that the color - singlet model with relativistic corrections still underestimates the cross section for @xmath138 by an appreciable amount @xcite .",
    "as @xmath139 , the final state gluon in the @xmath87gluon fusion becomes softer and softer , although this does not cause any infrared divergence in the transition matrix element . therefore , it would be more meaningful to factorize the effect of this final soft gluon into the color - octet matrix elements , @xmath140 and @xmath141",
    ". the color - octet @xmath142 and @xmath143 states might reduce the gap between the color - singlet prediction and the experimental value of @xmath144 for @xmath145 .",
    "the color - octet @xmath29 subprocess ( 3.21 ) considered before not only contributes to the elastic peak of the @xmath0 photoproduction , but it also contributes to the resolved photon processes at @xmath146 , where the initial partons can be either gluon or light quarks ( @xmath147 ) .",
    "these processes are suppressed by @xmath148 but enhanced by @xmath149 , relative to the resolved photon process in the color - singlet model .",
    "also , they can enhance the high-@xmath150 s , which might be relevant to the @xmath0 photoproduction at hera .",
    "this can be a background to the determination of gluon distribution function of a proton , if the cross section is appreciable .",
    "the resolved photon process in the color - singlet model is dominant over the @xmath87gluon fusion in the lower @xmath33 region , @xmath151 , and it can be discarded by a suitable cut on @xmath33 . since the color - octet contribution to the resolved photon process has not been studied in the literature , we address this issue here . when one considers @xmath152 one has to include @xmath153 simultaneously , since both are the same order of @xmath146 .",
    "this diagram is the same as the color - singlet case except for the color factor of the @xmath154 state .",
    "it is straightforward , although lengthy , to calculate the amplitudes for the above three processes . using reduce in order to the spinor algebra in a symbolic manner",
    ", we can get the averaged  @xmath155   squared for various  @xmath156  processes .",
    "another color - octet @xmath157 contribution to the @xmath85photoproduction comes from the compton scattering type subprocesses : @xmath158 where @xmath159 and @xmath160 are the four momentum and the polarization vector of the @xmath161 color - octet state , and @xmath162 is its color index .",
    "this subprocess , if important , can be a background to the determination of the gluon distribution function in a proton , since it is initiated by light quarks . from the naive power counting",
    ", however , we infer this subprocess occurs at @xmath163 in the coupling constant expansion , and also suppressed by @xmath148 compared to the color - singlet contribution ( 3.1 ) due to its color - octet nature .",
    "thus , this subprocess is expected to be negligible .",
    "one can actually quantify this argument by explicitly evaluating the feynman diagrams for ( 3.34 ) .",
    "the effective vertex for @xmath164 is given by @xcite @xmath165 where @xmath166 is the polarization of the produced spin-1 color octet object .",
    "using this effective vertex , one can calculate the amplitude for @xmath167 @xmath168~u(p_{1}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath169 is the electric charge of the light quark inside proton(@xmath170 ) .",
    "the average amplitude squared for the color - octet @xmath171 state is given by @xmath172 this completes our discussions on the color - octet @xmath30 subprocess for @xmath0 photoproductions .",
    "now , we are ready to show the numerical results using the analytic expressions obtained in the previous section .",
    "let us first summarize the input parameters and the structure functions we will use in the following .",
    "the results are quite sensitive to the numerical values of @xmath11 and @xmath173 and the factorization scale @xmath174",
    ". we shall use @xmath175 , @xmath176 gev and @xmath177 .",
    "for the structure functions , we use the most recent ones , mrsa @xcite and cteq3 m @xcite , which incorporate the new data from hera @xcite , on the lepton asymmetry in @xmath178boson production @xcite and on the difference in drell - yan cross sections from proton and neutron targets @xcite . for the @xmath29",
    ", we show results using both structure functions . for the @xmath30 case",
    ", we show the results with the cteq3 m structure functions only , since the mrsa structure functions yield almost the same results within @xmath179 or so .",
    "let us first consider the @xmath0 photoproduction via the color - octet @xmath29 subprocess .",
    "since the subprocess cross section ( 3.33 ) vanishes except at @xmath180 , one can infer that it contributes to the @xmath0 photoproductions in the forward direction ( @xmath181 ) . in figs .  1 ( a ) and ( b ) , we show the @xmath0 photoproduction cross section in the forward direction ( @xmath182 ) as well as the data from the fixed target experiments and the preliminary data from h1 at hera , respectively . in each case , the upper and the lower curves define the region allowed by the relation ( 1.4 ) for two color - octet matrix elements , @xmath183 and latexmath:[$\\langle 0    experiments , @xmath182 is usually characterized by @xmath185 , with the remainder being associated with the inelastic @xmath0 photoproduction . according to this criterion , the experimental value of @xmath186 contains contributions from inelastic production of @xmath0 s .",
    "thus , the data should lie above the predictions from the color - octet @xmath29 subprocess , ( 3.21 ) .",
    "1 ( a ) shows that the situation is opposite to this expectation .",
    "color - octet contributions are larger than the data , which indicates that the numerical values of the color - octet matrix elements are probably too large . at hera",
    ", one has the elastic @xmath0 photoproduction data , which can be identified with the color - octet @xmath29 subprocess . by saturating the relation ( 1.4 ) by either color - octet matrix element",
    ", we get the @xmath0 photoproduction cross section in the forward direction ( fig .  1 ( b ) ) .",
    "we observe again that the color - octet contribution with ( 1.4 ) overestimates the cross section by a large amount .",
    "this disagreement can arise from two sources : ( i ) the radiative corrections to @xmath187 , which were ignored in ref .",
    "@xcite is important , and/or ( ii ) the heavy quark spin symmetry for @xmath188 may not be a good approximation . although the heavy quark spin symmetry relation is used quite often in heavy quarkonium physics , it may be violated by a considerable amount @xcite .",
    "recently , amundson _",
    "_ performed the @xmath189 fit to the available fixed target experiments and the hera data independently , and found that [ 13 ] @xmath190 using the mrsa@xmath191 , and cteq3 m structure functions with @xmath192 and @xmath193 gev .",
    "this determination is not compatible with the relation ( 1.4 ) , since the resulting @xmath194 is negative .",
    "this is another way to say that the determination of the color - octet matrix elements from the @xmath0 productions at the tevatron may not be that reliable .",
    "in fact , this is not very surprising , since the radiative corrections to the lowest - order color - singlet contributions to the @xmath0 hadroproductions are not included yet .",
    "next , we consider the @xmath0 photoproduction through @xmath30 parton - level subprocesses . as discussed before , the pqcd corrections to the lowest order @xmath195",
    "is not under proper control for @xmath196 .",
    "therefore , we impose a cut @xmath197 at emc energy , @xmath198 gev , and at hera with @xmath199 gev , we impose cuts on @xmath33 and @xmath108 @xcite : @xmath200 in both cases , we set @xmath123 .    in figs .  2 ( a ) and ( b ) , we show the @xmath144 distributions of @xmath0 at emc ( nmc ) and hera along with the corresponding data .",
    "in both cases , the color - octet @xmath201 contribution ( compton scattering type ) is negligible in most regions of @xmath33 , and thus can be safely neglected .",
    "the thick dashed and the thin dashed curves correspond to the cases where the relation ( 1.4 ) is saturated by @xmath202 and @xmath203 , respectively .",
    "the thick and the thin solid curves represent the sum of the color - singlet and the color - octet contributions , in case that the relation ( 1.4 ) is saturated by @xmath204 and @xmath205 , respectively . in either case ,",
    "we observe that the color - octet @xmath206 and @xmath207 contributions begin to dominate the color - singlet contributions for @xmath208 , and become too large for high @xmath33 region considering we have not added the enhancements at high @xmath33 due to the relativistic corrections .",
    "thus , this behavior of rapid growing at high @xmath33 does not agree with the data points at emc and hera , if we adopt the determination ( 1.4 ) by cho and leibovich @xcite .    in fig .  3",
    ", we show the inelastic @xmath0 photoproduction cross section as a function of @xmath209 with the cut , @xmath210 and @xmath119 .",
    "again , the color - octet @xmath201 contribution is too small , and thus not shown in the figure . here again , the color - octet @xmath206 and @xmath207 contributions via @xmath30 subprocesses dominate the color - singlet contribution , if the relation ( 1.4 ) is imposed .",
    "although the total seems to be in reasonable agreement with the preliminary h1 data , direct comparison may be meaningful only if the cascade @xmath0 s from @xmath45 decays have been subtracted out .",
    "there are also considerable amount of uncertainties coming from @xmath211 and @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to say that the color - octet @xmath206 and @xmath207 states dominate the singlet contribution to the @xmath0 photoproduction , if the relation ( 1.4 ) is imposed .",
    "in summary , we considered the color - octet contributions to ( a ) the inclusive @xmath0 productions in @xmath22 decays , and ( b ) the @xmath0 photoproductions ( @xmath212 ) through ( i ) @xmath213 and the subsequent evolution of @xmath214 into a physical @xmath0 with @xmath215 and @xmath216 , ( ii ) the subprocesses @xmath217 .",
    "these are compared with ( i ) the measured @xmath0 photoproduction cross section in the forward direction , and ( ii ) the @xmath33 distributions of @xmath0 at emc and hera , and the preliminary result on the inelastic @xmath0 photoproduction total cross section at hera .",
    "one finds that the relation ( 1.4 ) color - octet lead to too large contributions of the color - octet @xmath206 and @xmath207 states to the above observables .",
    "especially , the first two observables contradict the observation .",
    "this is also against the naive expectation that the color - octet contribution may not be prominent as in the case of the @xmath0 hadroproductions , since they are suppressed by @xmath148 ( although enhanced by one power of @xmath11 ) relative to the color - singlet contribution .",
    "it is also pointed out that the same is true of the process @xmath69 , in which the relation ( 1.4 ) predicts its branching ratio to be too large by an order of magnitude compared with the data .",
    "therefore , one may conclude that the color - octet matrix elements involving @xmath218 might be overestimated by an order of magnitude .",
    "since the relation ( 1.4 ) has been extracted by fitting the @xmath0 production at the tevatron to the lowest order color - singlet and the color - octet contributions , it may be changed when one considers the radiative corrections to the lowest order color - singlet contributions .",
