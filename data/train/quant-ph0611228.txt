    "light - matter quantum interface is a basic element of any quantum information network aiming at long distance quantum communication , cryptography protocols or quantum computing , see @xcite .",
    "light is a natural carrier of quantum information and a macroscopic atomic system can be efficiently used for its storage .",
    "critical ingredients of the quantum interface are the quantum memory and entanglement protocols , which allow high - fidelity interchange ( transfer , storage and readout ) of quantum states between the light and relatively long - lived atomic subsystems .",
    "a number of promising theoretical proposals for the high - fidelity memory and entanglement protocols has been put forward , which can be classified as based on off - resonant interaction , such as raman interaction @xcite , quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) interaction with quantum feedback - qndf @xcite , multiple qnd interactions ref.@xcite , and on resonant interaction using electromagnetically induced transparency - eit @xcite . in spite of a large number of proposals , experimental realization of the complete storage plus retrieval quantum memory with the fidelity higher than classical is yet to be achieved .",
    "high fidelity storage ( but not complete retrieval ) has been demonstrated via the qndf approach @xcite and as light - to - atoms teleportation @xcite .",
    "low fidelity storage and retrieval of the coherent and single photon pulses based on eit @xcite and raman @xcite processes have been recently demonstrated .",
    "all experiments on light - atoms quantum interface to date are conducted with alkali atoms .",
    "previously the off - resonant quantum interface protocols @xcite utilized light with the detuning higher than the hyperfine splitting of the excited state . under this condition",
    "magnetic sublevels of a hyperfine state of an alkali atom can be effectively reduced to a spin - half system . as shown in the present paper eliminating this restriction and thus using the complete magnetic multipole system of the alkali atom ground state opens up new possibilities for quantum memory and entanglement generation with ensembles of such atoms .",
    "the quantum description of correlations in coherent raman scattering in the heisenberg formalism has a long history @xcite .",
    "however in quantum information applications the raman process is often discussed in terms of formal @xmath3-scheme configuration .",
    "in contrast in our treatment we describe this process in terms of polarization multipoles for multilevel ground state alkali atoms : gyrotropy ( orientation ) , linear birefringence ( alignment ) and higher multipole components .",
    "the field subsystem is described by a set of polarization stokes components .",
    "this approach allows for complete description of the mean values and fluctuations of the light and optically thick atomic medium .",
    "although examples treated in this paper concern atoms initially pumped to one level corresponding to a single @xmath3-scheme ( as shown in figures [ fig.1]and [ fig.2 ] ) , our formalism also allows to treat more complex initial states consisting of several coupled @xmath3-schemes .",
    "the formalism is also applicable beyond the heisenberg equations in a linearized form .",
    "finally , the multipole expansion facilitates systematic and compact calculation of the coupling constants in the effective hamiltonian taking into account the full hyperfine structure of the relevant atomic levels @xcite .",
    "we shall discuss the raman quantum memory scheme first considered in @xcite .",
    "we shall add the retrieval step to the protocol and analyze the complete procedure for a realistic model , taking full account of the multilevel hyperfine and magnetic sublevel structure of an alkali atom .",
    "we derive the polarization - sensitive coupled wave - type dynamics of an optically thick atomic ensemble and optical field . using spectral mode decomposition for light and spatial mode picture for the atomic ensemble",
    "we show that the quantum states of light and the quasi - spin of atoms can be effectively swapped or entangled .",
    "the general mathematical formalism for such atomic system with angular momentum higher or equal than one , has been developed in refs.@xcite .",
    "an important advantage of the memory and entanglement schemes in such a scenario is in that they can be realized in a single pass of light through atoms and without any feedback channel , which makes experimental realizations more feasible .    as an elementary carrier of the quantum information we consider a squeezed state of light .",
    "the relevance of quantum memory for these states for quantum information processing has been illustrated in proposals @xcite .",
    "we introduce stokes operators for a light pulse consisting of a circularly polarized strong classical mode and the quantum squeezed light in the orthogonal circularly polarized mode .",
    "we show that for the quantum stokes variables there is a convenient symmetric interaction with the alignment tensor components of atoms , whose spin angular momenta are equal or greater than one . in the quantum memory scenario",
    "the quantum information of the light subsystem can be effectively mapped into the alignment subsystem of atoms . in the entanglement scenario",
    "the excitation of atomic spins with coherent pulse generates a parametric - type interaction process , which results in creation of the strong correlations between the quantum fluctuations of the stokes components of the transmitted light and the alignment components in the spin subsystem of atoms .",
    "we consider the interaction via the @xmath1 line of @xmath2rb , as an important example , where a convenient spin - one system exists in the lower hyperfine sublevel of its ground state . for verification of the memory protocol",
    "we discuss its figure of merit for the mapping of the input squeezed state and for its retrieval after reading the quantum copy out from the spin subsystem with a second coherent light pulse .",
    "we discuss how the fidelity for the proposed quantum memory channel could be defined and compared with the respective classical benchmark based on direct measurement of the squeezed state parameters .",
    "we show that in an optimal configuration the quantum fidelity is always higher than the limit for the optimal competing classical channel .    throughout our analysis we neglect coupling of the ground state atomic degrees of freedom to other variables than the forward propagating light field .",
    "this approximation is justified on time scales which ar short compared to dephasing time of the ground state coherence .",
    "neglecting coupling to light modes propagating in other than the forward direction can only be a good approximation in the limit of high optical depth as detailed in section [ iiia ] .",
    "finally , the influence of the atomic motion capable of washing out spatial spin patterns is not taken into account , which restricts our analysis to cold atomic samples .",
    "in this paper we will consider two alternative experimental situations respectively shown in figures [ fig.1 ] and [ fig.2 ] .",
    "for both schemes a 100% right - hand circular polarized classical light pulse interacts with an ensemble of ultracold spin - oriented atoms .",
    "the principal difference is in the direction of the collective spin of the atomic ensemble , which can be oriented either along ( fig.[fig.1 ] ) or opposite ( fig.[fig.2 ] ) to the propagation direction of light .",
    "consider first the process shown in figure [ fig.1 ] .",
    "for an off - resonant right - hand polarized pulse , such that incoherent scattering losses do not frustrate the spin polarization , there will be no interaction between the light and atoms .",
    "however if a small portion of a left - hand polarized quantum informative light prepared in an unknown squeezed vacuum state is admixed to the classical coherent pulse , the coherent scattering channel will be open",
    ". the portion of the weak quantum light will be coherently scattered into the strong classical mode . in this coherent raman process the polarization quantum subsystem of the probe light and the spin subsystem of atoms can effectively swap their quantum states .",
    "the quantum state can be mapped into the alignment - type fluctuations of the spin subsystem and further stored in the form of a certain standing spin wave for relatively long time .",
    "it can be readout on demand with a second probe light pulse .    in the experimental situation shown in figure [ fig.2 ] , for a transparent medium a small portion of",
    "the left - hand polarized photons will emerge as a result of the coherent elastic raman scattering of the strong light pulse .",
    "this process creates entanglement the left - hand polarized quantum modes of light and the alignment - type quantum fluctuations in the atomic spin subsystem .",
    "this kind of deterministic entanglement can be interesting for implementing a quantum repeater protocol between remote atomic systems .",
    "the processes shown in figures [ fig.1 ] and [ fig.2 ] have practically identical theoretical description .",
    "thus we will discuss them in parallel paying attention to the differences in their physical nature .",
    "we begin by introducing the relevant set of the field and atomic variables involved in these processes .",
    "the polarization states of the light subsystem can be specified in terms of the following flux - type variables for different stokes components .",
    "the heisenberg operators for the total photon flux considered at the spatial point @xmath4 and at the time moment @xmath5 are given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 are the positive / negative frequency components of the electric field heiseberg operators .",

    "the former manifests itself as an averaged interaction between atoms and light and the latter actually creates the quantum fluctuation interface between these subsystems . let us point out that in a formal description based on a @xmath3-type configuration the fluctuations of birefringence ( alignment ) components are usually treated as an atomic coherence created by raman process in a quasi - spin subsystem and the importance of the phase - matching gyrotropy can be underestimated .",
    "we show how this effect can be properly taken into consideration by direct solution of eqs.([2.11 ] ) .    equations ( [ 2.11 ] ) introduce the following important parameters : @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the first two describe the changes in the mean classical parameters of light and atoms .",

    "the third parameter @xmath59 is the most important and is responsible for the coupled dynamics of the fluctuations of the polarization components of light and of the atomic alignment components .",
    "the microscopic expressions for all these characteristics for the case of hyperfine transitions of alkali atoms are summarized in appendix [ a ]    before we discuss the solutions of these equations we turn again to the physics of the processes shown in figures [ fig.1 ] and [ fig.2 ] .",
    "the difference between these processes is only indicated by different signs of @xmath52 in the second pair of equations ( [ 2.11 ] ) .",
    "for positive @xmath64 ( fig.[fig.1 ] ) these equations yield the normal wave - type solution leading to the swapping of the quantum states between the light and spin subsystems .",
    "then the memory protocol can develop in the following way .",
    "if the quantum field is prepared in an unknown left - hand polarized squeezed - vacuum state its momentum / position quadrature components can be expressed as @xmath65 where the phase @xmath66 determining the orientation of the squeezed and anti - squeezed quadratures in the phase plane as well as their variances are the unknown parameters of the state .",
    "if such an unknown squeezed state is superimposed with a classical coherent mode one straightforwardly gets that @xmath67the crucial point for the atoms - field dynamics described by equations ( [ 2.11 ] ) and for the memory protocol is that the direction of the axes @xmath47 and @xmath48 remains _ _",
    "c__ompletely unknown in the experiment , see figure [ fig.1 ] .",
    "thus the unknown squeezed state transforms into the unknown polarization squeezing such that the @xmath15 component is squeezed and @xmath12 is anti - squeezed .",
    "the dynamics of these components is further developing in accordance with equations ( [ 2.11 ] ) and under certain conditions the squeezed state of light can be converted into the squeezed state of the alignment components of the atomic spin angular momenta .    for the negative sign of @xmath52 ( fig.[fig.2 ] ) there is no normal wave solution of the equations ( [ 2.11 ] ) .",
    "as we will show in this case there is an exponential enhancement of the quantum fluctuations of the stokes components and of the atomic alignment .",
    "such an anomalous spin polariton wave describes an entangled state of these subsystems . after interaction the low frequency modes of the polarization and intensity spectrum of the outgoing light",
    "will be entangled with the alignment - type standing wave modes of the atomic spins .",
    "such process can be for example utilized in the quantum repeater protocol with remote atomic systems .",
    "the heisenberg equations ( [ 2.11 ] ) can be solved via the method of laplace transform similar to how it was done in ref.@xcite .",
    "the solution and verification of the commutation relations are given in appendix [ b ] . in this section",
    "we discuss the physical consequences which are mainly important from the quantum information point of view . for the sake of simplicity and without loss of generality , see ref.@xcite , we will ignore the retardation effects and restrict our discussion to the low frequency fluctuations such that in equations ( [ 2.11 ] ) we neglect time derivatives of the field variables .",
    "we also restrict our consideration to the special case when the relevant pair of zeeman sublevels , which is either @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( fig.[fig.1 ] ) or @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( fig.[fig.2 ] ) , is always degenerate such that @xmath72 during the interaction and @xmath73 without the interaction .",
    "this non - critical but convenient simplification allows us to consider storage of quantum states of light in the time independent standing spin wave without any zeeman - type oscillations , see appendix [ b ] .",
    "the qualitative character of the cooperative dynamics of the atomic and field variables can be illustrated by the dispersion relation ( [ b.6 ] ) for the spin polariton modes and light modes defined in the semi - infinite medium and for infinite interaction time .",
    "then temporal and spatial dynamics of the process can be expressed by the respective laplace modes @xmath74 and @xmath75 introduced by expansion ( [ b.4 ] ) .",
    "the laplace variables for the inverse transform can be parameterized as @xmath76 .",
    "then the inverse transform reveals a spectral fourier expansion over the set of relevant temporal and spatial modes .",
