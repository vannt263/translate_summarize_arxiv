    "the cosmic x - ray background , hereafter called cxb , dominates the hard x - ray surface brightness ( @xcite ) , and was discovered with the aerobee sounding rocket carrying three geiger counters @xcite along with the first extra - solar x - ray source , sco x-1 .",
    "the effort of resolving the cxb into discrete sources has produced a @xmath14 @xmath15  relation , which gives the number density ( @xmath17 ) of discrete sources above a certain flux level ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "this study made a major advance recently with the advent of the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory .",
    "the detection limit of _ chandra _ is down to @xmath19 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4  in the 210 kev band , and some of the sources are too faint for optical identifications to be made . in this energy range , more than half ( 6090% ) of the cxb emission has been resolved into discrete sources ( e.g.  @xcite for the ssa13 field ; @xcite for the _ chandra _ deep field north ; @xcite for the _ chandra _ deep field south ) .",
    "moreover , recent _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ results indicate a turn - over of around @xmath20 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4  @xcite . above this flux level , the relation seems to be consistent with a uniform distribution of sources in euclidean space , namely , @xmath21 ( piccinotti et al .",
    "1982 ; hayashida et al .  1992",
    "; ueda et al .",
    "1999a , b ) . at the present time",
    ", the 210 kev cxb has been almost resolved into discrete sources , leaving at most 1020% at the faintest flux limit .",
    "the main uncertainty of the resolved fraction lies in the measurement of the total intensity of the cxb , which requires a well - calibrated detector with a low internal background , as well as large sky coverage .",
    "it also became clear that the emission consists of roughly two components .",
    "the hard - band emission in @xmath510 kev shows almost an isotropic distribution in the sky , and the spectrum is characterized by a power - law spectrum with a photon index of @xmath22 ( e.g.  @xcite : 315 kev ; @xcite : 110 kev ; @xcite : 110 kev ; @xcite : 18 kev ) .",
    "the survey observations by _ uhuru _ ( 27 kev ) and _ heao  1 _ a-2 ( @xmath510 kev ) showed that the dipole amplitude after removing the galactic contribution were @xmath23% ( @xcite ) and @xmath13% ( @xcite ) , respectively .",
    "below @xmath5 kev , the spectrum becomes steeper with @xmath24 ( e.g.  @xcite at @xmath25 kev ) .",
    "rosat _ all - sky survey observation showed significant structures in the soft x - ray background which are correlated mainly with the galactic distribution of the hot gas @xcite .",
    "as for the absolute intensity of the cxb , there is fairly large uncertainty among the measurements ; namely , the reported intensities at 1 kev are @xmath26 @xcite , @xmath27 @xcite and @xmath28 @xcite photon  kev@xmath4  @xmath3  s@xmath4  sr@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite compiled previous measurements of the cxb intensity with the _ asca _ , _ bepposax _ and _ rosat _ and pointed out that these differences are primarily caused by the cosmic variance , i.e.  spatial variation of source count due to the limited solid angle of sky coverage , and in some part resulted from instrumental cross - calibration errors and subtraction process of the galactic contribution .",
    "x - ray surveys with optical follow - up observations ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) have identified many active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and provided information about their spectral evolution .",
    "there is a significant discrepancy between the spectral indices of the cxb above @xmath5 kev ( @xmath22 ) and of type-1 seyfert galaxies ( @xmath29 ) , which led to a model that a significant fraction of agn is heavily absorbed ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , for the sources with @xmath30 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4 , the _ xmm - newton _ satellite revealed that around half of them are strongly absorbed in their spectra @xcite . in the flux range @xmath31@xmath32 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4 , a spectral survey from _ asca _ showed that the average spectral slope becomes progressively harder as the sources become fainter , and the observed photon index of 2.1 at around @xmath32 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4  turns to 1.6 at around @xmath33 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4  in the 0.710 kev band @xcite .",
    "a precise determination of the spectral shape of the cxb and an investigation of its field - to - field difference would provide rich information to understand the spectral evolution of agns taking place around the flux of @xmath33 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4 .",
    "the _ asca _ medium - sensitivity survey ( amss ) is a serendipitous survey , consisting of 368 fields which can be regarded as a random sampling of the cxb .",
    "@xcite produced a catalog of 1343 x - ray sources based on the amss , and gave a fairly tight @xmath14 @xmath15  relation in the flux range above @xmath34 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4  @xcite . also , combined with the _ asca _ large sky survey ( ueda et al .",
    "1998 , 1999a ) , the main aim of the present study is to determine the absolute intensity and the spectral shape of the cxb as precisely as possible .",
    "the data after the point - source elimination formed the basis for the present study .",
    "it would also enable us to constrain the @xmath14 @xmath15  relation or the intrinsic spectral distribution of the constituent sources through the fluctuation analysis , as well as to look into the large - scale distribution of the cxb .",
    "the gis system @xcite consists of two gas imaging spectrometers , which have well - studied and low internal background , simultaneously providing a large ( @xmath35 in diameter ) field of view ( f.o.v . ) , when compared with the _ xmm - newton _ pn and mos ccds and _ chandra _ acis ccds .",
    "these properties are powerful for studying the spectral features of the cxb .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : obs ] , we discuss the selection criteria of the fields employed in the present paper for the cxb analysis and explain how energy spectra are extracted . in section [ sec : res ] , we present the fitting results . in section [ sec : large ] , the large - scale distributions in the spectral parameters are investigated . in section",
    "[ sec : lognlogs ] , using simulations which take into account the complicated response of _ asca _ , we evaluate the cxb intensity and constrain the @xmath14 @xmath15  relation and the spectral distribution of sources from the observed fluctuation . in section [ sec : dis ] , we discuss implications of the results , and the summary will be given in section [ sec : con ] .",
    "the present study was carried out with a gis instrument consisting of gis  2 and gis  3 sensors ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the detectors had a wide ( @xmath36 in diameter ) f.o.v .  and a moderate spatial resolution of @xmath37 ( half power diameter ) combined with the x - ray telescope ( xrt ; @xcite ) .",
    "our primary goal of the analysis was to determine the parameters of the cxb for each direction which can not be resolved into discrete sources with the gis , namely , the _ unresolved _ cxb . due to the low surface brightness of the unresolved cxb , we had to take into account several issues that would not matter very much in point - source studies .",
    "first of all , the sample fields must be carefully selected in order to obtain reasonable constraints on the parameters .",
    "the second one is to minimize and precisely estimate the amount of fake signals caused mainly by charged particles , which we call the non x - ray background ( nxb ) .",
    "the third one is to eliminate _ resolved _ sources in the gis f.o.v .",
    "the last one is the instrumental response for the unresolved cxb .",
    "our sample fields were primarily selected from the first amss fields ( @xcite ) , which consisted of 368 combined fields observed between 1993 may and 1996 december with the galactic latitude @xmath38 .",
    "we also included the field of the _ asca _ large sky survey ( lss ; ueda et al .",
    "1998 , 1999a ) , dividing the lss field into four , labeling them a - lss , b - lss , c - lss , and d - lss , from south - west to north - east .    in our prompt sample ,",
    "several fields were composed of multiple pointing observations , covering a larger sky area than that of a single pointing .",
    "furthermore , most of the amss fields were pointed to certain targets and often contained rather bright x - ray sources to study the cxb . since the point spread function ( psf ) of the xrt",
    "has long outskirt , approximated by @xmath39 a bright target source would contaminate the whole detector area ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "we therefore selected fields based on the following criteria :    1 .",
    "total exposure time summed up over all pointings is longer than @xmath41 ks .",
    "no known extended x - ray sources is present in the field , e.g. , nearby galaxies , star - forming regions , or supernova remnants .",
    "3 .   the mean count rate including the nxb is lower than 0.3 count  s@xmath4 per one gis sensor in 0.710 kev , accumulated within a radius of 22 mm ( @xmath42 ) from the optical axis of each sensor . for multi - pointing observations ,",
    "we accept fields when at least one pointing fulfills this condition .",
    "4 .   the remained sky area after the source elimination ( `` area  2 '' column of table  [ tab : obs ] ) is more than two thirds of the original sky area ( `` area  1 '' ) .",
    "exactly 100 fields satisfied these conditions .    since the xrt allows some fraction of photons from outside of the f.o.v .  to pass through ( stray light ; @xcite ) , it is a significant problem in the cxb study with _ asca_. figure  [ fig : crab ] represents the 0.710 kev count rate of the crab nebula pointed at various offset angles from the optical axis of each gis sensor . when the crab nebula was placed at @xmath43 away from the optical axis , namely far outside of the gis f.o.v .",
    ", its count rate was still larger than 10 count  s@xmath4  sensor@xmath4 in 0.710 kev . since the cxb gave only @xmath44 count  s@xmath4  sensor@xmath4 in the same energy band , the stray flux needed to be carefully examined . in order to avoid any influence of the stray light in the present analysis , we further selected those fields which had no bright sources around the f.o.v .",
    "we mainly consulted with the _ rosat _ all - sky survey bright source catalog ( rass - bsc ; @xcite ) , which lists sources with a flux limit of @xmath45 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4 , assuming a power - law photon index of @xmath46 in the 0.12.4 kev energy band .",
    "however , the sensitive energy range of _ rosat _ is limited to below @xmath5 kev and sources with hard spectra or strong absorption would be missed .",
    "heao  1 _ a-1 x - ray source catalog ( @xcite ) was also used to follow up such cases .",
    "_ heao  1 _ a-1 is sensitive above @xmath5 kev , and the flux limit is @xmath47 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4  in 210 kev for a crab - like spectrum .",
    "based on these catalogs , the distance distribution of the cataloged sources from the centers of the selected 100 fields was determined as shown in figure  [ fig : rass+a1-cut ] . in this figure ,",
    "the source intensities are plotted as a function of the offset angle .",
    "the solid curve indicates a level where sources above it could contribute to the cxb intensity accumulated within the whole gis f.o.v .",
    "( @xmath48 mm @xmath49 ) by more than 2.5% .",
    "this estimation is based on a calibration observation of the crab nebula at various offset angles , which is indicated in figure  [ fig : crab ] by the solid line . using the _ rosat _ sources , we excluded 9 fields in which there were sources above the 2.5% line _ outside _ the gis f.o.v .",
    "( @xmath50 mm @xmath49 ) .",
    "we did not exclude fields if bright sources are _ inside _ the f.o.v .",
    ", i.e.  in the hatched region in figure  [ fig : rass+a1-cut ] , since they would be eliminated in the source - elimination process ( see subsection [ subsec : elimination ] ) . as for the _ heao  1 _ sources , any fields were excluded if sources brighter than @xmath51 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4  were present within @xmath52 .",
    "this is because the positional errors of the _ heao  1 _ sources are quite large ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "one field was picked up by the _ heao  1_-source selection ;",
    "however , it had already been marked by the _ rosat_-source selection .",
    "we therefore excluded 9 fields in total .",
    "one of the lss fields ( a - lss ) was rejected here .",
    "after these field selections , we ended up with 91 fields whose sky distribution is shown in figure  [ fig : fields ] together with the original amss and lss fields .",
    "the names and coordinates of the fields are listed in table  [ tab : obs ] . among them",
    ", 33 fields consist of multi - pointing observations .",
    "the exposure time of the 91 ( 88 ) fields amounts to 4240.54 ( 3844.27 ) ks and the covering sky area extends 49.53 ( 42.77 ) deg@xmath1 , where the numbers in parentheses denote those without the three lss fields . according to the amss and the lss catalogs , the brightest source in the 91 fields is 1axgj 085449 + 2006 with 0.77 kev flux of @xmath53 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4  in oj 287 field , or 1axg j004847 + 3157 with 210 kev flux of @xmath54 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4  in mrk 348 field , depending on the chosen energy band .",
    "both sources correspond to the target , itself , i.e.  oj 287 or mrk 348 . among the 88 amss fields ,",
    "there are 184 ( 141 ) sources with their 0.77 ( 210 ) kev flux brighter than @xmath55 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4  in each energy band in the amss catalog .",
    "we screened all of the gis events detected in each sample field , first employing the standard event selection criteria : ( 1 ) the gis should be in the nominal observation mode , i.e.  the ph normal mode with the nominal bit assignment , the spread discriminator turned on , and the satellite not in the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) where the high - voltage supply of the gis is switched off ; ( 2 ) the elevation of f.o.v .",
    "should be @xmath56 ( or @xmath57 ) above the night ( or sunlit ) earth rim ; ( 3 ) the geomagnetic cut - off rigidity ( cor ) should be @xmath58 gv .",
    "we performed further event screening utilizing the gis monitor counts ( h0 + h2 ; see @xcite ; @xcite ) , radiation belt monitor ( rbm ) count , and cor .",
    "this additional selection improved the reproducibility of the nxb estimation , mainly by rejecting data affected by sporadic increases in the nxb count , which were due probably to the concentration of charged particles on the satellite orbit .",
    "a stricter condition for the rbm count was applied around the saa and hawaii .",
    "details of the screening procedure are described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the obtained event list contains not only the cxb photons , but also the nxb events , which must be carefully subtracted .",
    "the corresponding spectra or images of the nxb were separately created , using observations when the xrt was pointed to the night earth .",
    "under the same condition as described in the previous paragraph , we processed seven years of night - earth data from 1993 june to 2000 may , with a net exposure time of 4880.43 ks .",
    "we further sorted both the observed data and the night - earth data into six intervals of the h0 + h2 monitor count in 5 count  s@xmath4 steps , and performed nxb subtraction for each interval .",
    "this is because the h0 + h2 monitor count , which is tightly correlated with the nxb count ( @xcite ) , can be used as a good nxb indicator during on - source observations .",
    "there is also a long - term change of the nxb count rate , which is shown in figure  [ fig : nxb ] .",
    "the count rate gradually increased for the first four years , and then turned to decreasing , peaking at around 19971998 .",
    "this long - term change was presumably caused by a gradual drop in the satellite altitude and the cycle of the solar activities with a period of @xmath59 yrs . during the quiescent state of the solar activities , which is at the minimum around 19961997 , the atmosphere shrunk so that the density of charged particles increased . since the observation date of our sample fields ranged from 1993 june to 1996 december",
    ", there could be about a @xmath60% error in the nxb estimation unless the long - term trend were corrected .",
    "we fitted the trend by a fourth - order polynomial , which was used for the correction .",
    "we estimated that the nxb had been reproduced by an accuracy of 3% using the h0 + h2 monitor count and corrected for the long - term trend .",
    "therefore , the systematic uncertainty in the nxb subtraction affects the cxb intensity by at most 10% , even at @xmath61 kev where the nxb dominates the cxb ( see figure  [ fig : uchiwake ] ) .",
    "the cxb intensity can be defined by equation ( [ eq : fs ] ) in subsection  [ subsec : sim ] , even including the contribution from very bright sources , namely , by setting @xmath62 in equation ( [ eq : fs ] ) in subsection [ subsec : sim ] . on the other hand , because actual observations are usually biased to the faint so - called blank sky , the observed intensity needs a certain correction .",
    "this correction depends on the observed flux range , @xmath63 , where it is assured that only the sources with their fluxes fainter than @xmath64 exist in a sample field .",
    "therefore , it is essentially required to eliminate _ resolved _",
    "sources on the source flux basis .",
    "we employed a certain fixed value of @xmath65 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4  ( 210 kev ) , and defined that sources brighter than @xmath64 were _ resolved _ and that the remained x - ray emission was the _",
    "unresolved _ cxb .",
    "this procedure is also important in order to overcome the selection bias of the amss fields , because they are originally intended to observe specific targets . since the amss and",
    "the lss catalogs are constructed on the source significance basis , some sources with low significances but possible high flux or extended emission could be missed .",
    "we therefore developed an original method for eliminating sources by slightly modifying the source detection procedure of the amss . throughout this paper , we call this method as `` source elimination '' , which is described in the following paragraphs .",
    "the resolved sources were eliminated using the observed data , itself , in each field .",
    "we first constructed a mosaic flat - field image @xmath66 in the sky coordinates .",
    "this is a probability map that is proportional to the intensity of resolved sources , after subtracting the nxb and the unresolved cxb , and correcting for the telescope vignetting and the exposure of each pointing .",
    "this image is useful to set a threshold in terms of the x - ray flux .",
    "the @xmath66 was created in the 0.77 kev band since the nxb is dominant in the higher energy band . in order to eliminate sources at the rim region effectively , events within a radius of 22 mm ( @xmath42 ) from the optical axis of each gis sensor",
    "were accumulated , which is by 10% larger than the radius of 20 mm ( @xmath49 ) when we created an energy spectrum .",
    "a single @xmath66 image was created for each sample field , by summing up all pointings for both gis  2 and gis  3 in the common sky coordinates .",
    "the nxb image to be subtracted was generated for each pointing and for each sensor , as described in subsection [ subsec : nxb ] . with regard to the unresolved cxb image",
    ", we created a template image for each gis sensor , which was commonly used for every field and every pointing .",
    "this template was made from a sunlit - earth image in 13 kev integrated over two years from 1993 june to 1995 june , because of its uniformness and extreme brightness . since its spectrum is much softer than the cxb , we corrected the radial brightness profile for the xrt vignetting utilizing a radial profile of the superposed lss image in 0.77 kev , in which irregularities due to the discrete sources are sufficiently smeared out . the normalization of the template was determined to give 88% intensity of the lss field .",
    "although this is an empirical factor , it is considered to be close to the unresolved fraction of the x - ray emission in the lss field .",
    "details are described by @xcite .    after subtracting these two images , the observed image was cross - correlated with the psf of the xrt+gis system . since the shape of the psf of the xrt strongly depends on the source position on the detector , we calculated it by interpolating the cyg x-1 images , which were observed with various offset angles and azimuth angles within a radius of @xmath67 from the optical axis ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the vignetting of the xrt was also corrected here .",
    "this series of processes was made for each sensor ( 2 sensors ) and each pointing ( @xmath68 pointings ) , and afterwards all @xmath69 images were summed up to build a single mosaic image .",
    "finally , corrected for the exposure time considering the overlap of multiple pointings , the @xmath66 image was complete .",
    "for the thus - obtained @xmath66 image , we settled on a certain threshold level which corresponded to @xmath2 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4  ( 0.77 kev ) , and searched for peaks above it .",
    "this flux level was chosen because the sources were detected at a 510  @xmath11 significance , depending on the distance from the optical axis , for a typical exposure of 3040 ks . if we assumed a power - law spectrum of @xmath29 , which is typical for the resolved sources , the threshold flux did not change very much ( less than 10% ) by altering the energy range from 0.77 kev into 210 kev .",
    "when a peak was detected , a circular region was masked out from the data .",
    "the radius of the mask was determined so that the remaining surface brightness due to the tail of the psf would become less than 10% of the unresolved cxb .",
    "this calculation was conducted using equation ( [ eq : psf ] ) , and the typical mask diameters were @xmath70 and @xmath71 for fluxes of @xmath55 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4  and @xmath72 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4 , respectively . by omitting the masked sky regions , we created an energy spectrum for the remained area by accumulating events in each field . since the outermost region of the gis f.o.v .",
    "is dominated by the nxb , we collected events within a radius of 20 mm ( @xmath49 ) from the optical axis of each sensor .",
    "there are 331 sources listed in the amss catalog in our 88 selected amss fields .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : dist - amss ] , 90% of those amss sources were eliminated in this process at a flux level of @xmath73 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4  in 0.77 kev .",
    "some fraction of sources fainter than the threshold of @xmath2 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4  ( 0.77 kev ) are also eliminated because they happen to exist neighboring other bright sources . for each field ,",
    "the resultant sky area after the source elimination is compared with the original value in figure  [ fig : menseki ] .",
    "the sky coverage was thus reduced by about 20% with this process .",
    "an accurate instrumental ( xrt+gis ) response is required to quantify the cxb spectrum .",
    "however the xrt response depends significantly on the off - axis angle , making the overall response to the cxb much different from that to a point source .",
    "the superposition of point - source responses within the integration region is still insufficient due to the stray light .",
    "moreover , the responses are slightly different among the 91 sample fields , since the masking patterns of the source elimination are different from field to field .    in order to include these conditions in the response",
    ", we performed ray - tracing simulations for all 91 fields using the simarf code ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , which calculates the photon detection efficiency of the xrt+gis system at each energy , and generates a so - called auxiliary response file ( arf ) . in those simulations",
    ", we assumed a flat surface brightness which extends far beyond the gis f.o.v .",
    ", to be concrete , up to @xmath745 from the optical axis of each sensor .",
    "this assumption is good enough as a first approximation , at least for the unresolved cxb after the source elimination .",
    "however , it leaves some room for considering that we can eliminate the resolved sources in the f.o.v . , while we can not do so for sources outside the f.o.v .",
    ", from which some fraction of photons appear the stray light .",
    "we deal with this effect in subsection [ subsec : cmpstray ] .",
    "though a nuisance , the stray light was reproduced sufficiently well by a ray - tracing code ( @xcite ) , which we calibrated against large offset observations of the crab nebula up to @xmath75 , as shown in figure  [ fig : crab ] .",
    "the major origin of the stray light was due to the x - rays to come through abnormal paths , e.g.  only one reflection by the primary mirror or via reflection off the mirror backside , which were fully taken into account in a ray - tracing simulation .",
    "the stray - light estimation is considered to be accurate to within @xmath60% of the cxb intensity , with only a mild energy dependence .",
    "we have confirmed that the simarf generates an identical arf for a point source in the f.o.v .  with that made by ascaarf v2.81 in combination with the standard calibration database files , namely , gis2/3_ano_on_flf_180295.fits ( telescope definition file ) , xrt_ea_v2_0.fits ( effective area file ) , and xrt_psf_v2_0.fits ( psf file ) .",
    "a so - called _ arf filter _ was also applied to our simarf arf , which normalized the observed flux of the crab nebula with xrt+gis to the previously reported level and suppressed small residual structures in the spectral fitting . with the arf filter",
    ", the crab spectrum can be expressed by an absorbed power - law model with galactic absorption of @xmath76 @xmath3 , a photon index of @xmath77 , and 210 kev flux of @xmath78 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4  ( absorption not corrected ) .",
    "the arf filter was applied by default for the ascaarf arf with the `` arffil '' parameter ; the details are described in @xcite . as for the energy redistribution matrices ,",
    "the released version of gis2/3v4_0.rmf were used .",
    "spectral fits were performed with xspec v10.00 @xcite .      in summary , the constituents of the observed gis events in each field can be classified into the following four components : ( 1 ) the unresolved cxb originating in the f.o.v . ,",
    "( 2 ) x - rays from outside of the f.o.v . ,",
    "( 3 ) the resolved sources to be eliminated , and ( 4 ) the nxb . as an example",
    ", we plotted each spectrum for the whole lss field ( including a - lss ) in figure  [ fig : uchiwake ] . in this figure ,",
    "the spectra of @xmath79 , ( e ) , ( f ) , and ( b ) correspond to those classifications , respectively .",
    "the lss field is suitable for this purpose because of its large sky coverage and the unbiased field selection .",
    "the brightest source in the lss is ax j131822 + 3347 with 210 kev flux of @xmath80 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4 .",
    "the count rate of each component in the 0.77 ( 210 ) kev band is 0.055 ( 0.033 ) , 0.052 ( 0.022 ) , 0.011 ( 0.005 ) , and 0.045 ( 0.047 ) count  s@xmath4  sensor@xmath4 , respectively . since there is a comparable fraction of the stray light or the nxb to the unresolved cxb , accuracy of their estimation , as well as the statistics , determines the errors of the resultant cxb parameters .",
    "as mentioned in subsection [ subsec : nxb ] , the reproducibility of the nxb is considered to be 3% , which must be carefully dealt with when comparing the cxb parameters from field to field . on the other hand",
    ", the estimation error of the stray light mainly acts as if the effective area of the xrt is over- or under - estimated in common among the sample fields ; hence it does not matter severely in a field - to - field comparison .",
    "as mentioned in subsection [ subsec : response ] , because the stray - light estimation is considered to be accurate to within @xmath60% of the cxb intensity , one should only pay attention to comparing our results on the absolute cxb intensity with those of other satellites .",
    "in the first place , all the 91 spectra were fitted with a single power - law model .",

    "an average power - law photon index of @xmath86 ( 1  @xmath11 error ) with a standard deviation of 0.054 was obtained for the 91 sample fields .",

    "such a wide - spread detection of spectral data and the intensity variation of the soft component , as shown in figure  [ fig : examples ] , is a newly found feature ; the results would supplement the soft x - ray information obtained with the _ rosat _ all - sky survey .",
    "the variation amplitude of the soft component is roughly @xmath88 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4  sr@xmath4 .",
    "this is a factor - of - three higher than the level which can be accounted for by the change of the galactic @xmath81 between the maximum and the minimum . to fit the 0.710 kev spectra in a consistent way , we need an additional spectral model for the soft component . for this , we have tried ( 1 ) power - law and ( 2 ) mekal models . in both cases , the soft and the hard components",
    "were absorbed by the same galactic @xmath81 .",
    "for the double power - law fit , the data were unable to simultaneously constrain the 2 spectral slopes in some fields .",
    "in fact , some of the fit showed a negative slope for the hard component , which seriously conflicts with the established value of @xmath89 .",
    "we , therefore , fixed the slope of the hard component at 1.4 .",
    "the fit for the 91 spectra then gave an average power - law photon index for the soft component , @xmath90 ( 1  @xmath11 error ) with a standard deviation of 0.33 .",
    "spectral examples are shown in the middle panels of figure  [ fig : examples ] , indicating a significant improvement in the fit for the iras 19245@xmath917245 field .",
    "the slope of @xmath92 , however , indicates a steep rise in the soft band , and would imply a very strong emission in the _ rosat _ band unless some low - energy cut off is present .",
    "this behavior may have resulted from the power - law modeling of the soft component , and it seems to complicate the analysis procedure .",
    "our analysis of the lockman hole field , which has been extensively studied from other satellites , also yielded a rather steep value of @xmath93 ( 90% confidence level ) compared to @xmath94 obtained from _",

    "one component is probably associated with the galactic halo , and the other with the local hot bubble ( lhb ) . in @xcite using both the _ rosat _ pspc and the _ asca _ gis+sis data , these components were fitted with two thermal models , and each plasma temperature was derived to be @xmath95 kev and @xmath96 kev , respectively .",
    "however , it is hard for _ asca _ gis to detect these components separately , due to its limited sensitivity at the low - energy band .",
    "we therefore applied one thermal mekal model ( @xcite ) for these soft thermal components . following the fit with the double power - law model",

    "some examples of the spectral fit are shown in the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : examples ] .",
    "we then fixed the plasma temperature , @xmath97 , at several values of between 0.14 and 0.7 kev .",

    "the fitting results for the integrated spectrum are listed in table  [ tab:2 - 10kev ] , as well as those for the whole lss field ( including a - lss ) , because the lss is a good example of the so - called blank sky .",

    "the edge - like feature around 4.7 kev corresponds to the l - edge energy of xenon , which is the detector gas of gis . in summary",
    ", we should say conservatively that the present gis data do not indicate any significant deviation of the cxb spectrum from the nominal power - law spectrum in the energy range above 2 kev .    in order to check the contribution of bright sources in the gis f.o.v .",

    "these results are also shown in table  [ tab:2 - 10kev ] .",
    "the photon index , @xmath87 , seems not to be changed by applying the source elimination , while @xmath104 is significantly affected by @xmath105  % for the sample fields .",
    "this fraction is @xmath106% for the lss , smaller than the former .",
    "this is because the amss fields contains brighter sources , which are often the target itself , than the lss .",

    "we first consider the spatial distribution of the soft and hard components in our galaxy .",

    "the @xmath81 values were averaged over the respective angular cells .",
    "the instrumental responses were also summed within each cell .",
    "the soft component shows a nearly symmetric distribution around a peak at the galactic center .",
    "this feature clearly indicates that the soft component is a galactic emission , and is likely to extend further into the low - energy range . to examine this , we compared the soft - component intensity with the rass intensity , as shown in figure  [ fig : rass - asca ] .",
    "the correlation with the _ rosat_- 3/4 kev + 1.5 kev map ( @xcite , 1997 ) is generally good , suggesting that these enhancements are associated with the galactic bulge and the north polar spur .",
    "we also looked into some specific fields characterized by strong soft components .",
    "for example , in the iras 19254@xmath917245 field , the rass data also indicate a relatively strong flux .",
    "this supports the above view that the soft component has its origin within our galaxy .    in order to compare our results with previous studies , we fitted the observed @xmath115 profiles of @xmath104 and @xmath107 with a finite radius disk model , which successfully modeled the 260 kev and 218 kev distributions observed with _ heao  1 _ a-2 ( @xcite ) or _",
    "ariel  v _ ssi ( @xcite ) , respectively . in this model",
    ", there is no galactic x - ray emission outside of a disk of radius @xmath116 , and the emission within @xmath116 has an exponential dependence on the vertical distance above the plane characterized by a scale height parameter , @xmath117 .",
    "the total x - ray intensity , @xmath118 , is given by @xmath119,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the average isotropic extragalactic emission assumed in this model , @xmath122 is the normalization constant for the galactic emission , and @xmath123 is the distance to the galactic center .",
    "when we fit the observed distribution with this model , additional errors of 5.5% and 4.0% times @xmath104 were added to @xmath104 and @xmath107 , respectively , in order to adjust the reduced @xmath85 unity .",
    "this procedure is justified because the observed extragalactic cxb intensity , itself , would scatter intrinsically by about this amount , as described in section [ sec : lognlogs ] .",
    "the @xmath107 distribution was fitted well by the finite radius disk model , although there is a strong correlation between the scale height @xmath117 and the disk radius @xmath116 , as shown in figure  [ fig : cont - gal]a .",

    "the absorption - corrected flux of the hard power - law component in the 0.52 kev energy band is @xmath130 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4  sr@xmath4  if we assume the average photon index of @xmath131 over the whole energy range .",
    "therefore , the contribution of the galactic component in the 0.52 kev band is calculated to be 49% at @xmath132 , and 18% at @xmath133 , respectively .    for the hard power - law component",
    ", we could hardly constrain the parameters for the @xmath104 distribution by fitting it with the finite radius disk model , as shown in figure  [ fig : cont - gal]b .",
    "we therefore fixed the parameters at @xmath134 and @xmath135 , which were the best - fit values for the _ heao  1 _ a-2 observation ( @xcite ) .",
    "these values are inside of the @xmath136 region in figure  [ fig : cont - gal]b .",
    "we then obtained @xmath137% of @xmath138 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4",
    "sr@xmath4  ( errors are 1  @xmath11 ) , which agrees well with the _ heao  1 _ a-2 value of @xmath139% .",
    "hence , the galactic component in the 210 kev band has a low significance . using our best - fit values ,",
    "the galactic contribution in the 210 kev band was calculated to be 7.1% at @xmath140 , and 2.7% at @xmath133 , although the errors are large .",
    "these estimations are again consistent with the very early results from _",
    "ariel  v _ ssi ( @xcite ) , 7.2% and 2.5% , respectively .",
    "we can also compute the galactic contribution to the cxb fluctuation to be @xmath141% , based on the best - fit model .",
    "this is much smaller than the observed fluctuation of @xmath142  % ( table  [ tab : result ] ) .      aiming at detecting another spatial structure than the galactic component , we next tried to fit the intensity distribution with a dipole model , as a first - order approximation of the spherical harmonics .",
    "the dipole intensity distribution is expressed by @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the angle between the center of each field and the assumed pole direction , @xmath145 is the amplitude of the dipole , and @xmath146 is the average of the observed flux . as for the pole direction , we searched for all directions over the sky with a step size of @xmath147 .",
    "the hard and soft components were examined separately , and the errors in the fits were calculated in the same way as in the previous subsection .",
    "figure  [ fig : dipole ] shows the distributions of the best - fit dipole amplitude in the galactic coordinate .",
    "as expected from the previous subsection , the soft component ( @xmath107 ) indicates a strong peak near the galactic center at @xmath148 with a relative amplitude of @xmath149 ( 1  @xmath11 error ) .",
    "the hard component ( @xmath104 ) also suggests some dipole emission with a maximum amplitude of @xmath150% ( 1  @xmath11 error ) at @xmath151 .",
    "there are slight shifts from the galactic center to the positions of the maximum dipole amplitude , towards the south direction for the @xmath107 and east for the @xmath104 .",
    "this is presumably due to the influences of the brightest fields , the iras 19254 field at @xmath152 for the @xmath107 , and the phl 5200 field at @xmath153 for the @xmath104 . when these fields are removed in the dipole fittings , the directions of the shift change .",
    "since the galactic contribution is too much dominant , we further tried a dipole fitting after subtracting the best - fit dipole model with its pole directed to the galactic center .",
    "then , the residuals were consistent with no dipole emission at the 90% confidence level in the whole sky , for both @xmath107 and @xmath104 . according to the cosmic microwave background",
    "( cmb ) dipole ( @xcite ) , a dipole amplitude of 0.42% towards @xmath154 is expected due to the so - called compton - getting ( cg ) effect .",
    "the cg dipole originates in our local motion with respect to the distant x - ray frame , which is expected to agree with the direction and velocity determined from the cmb dipole .",
    "there is some evidence that the dipolar emission also exists in the x - ray band , e.g.  @xcite with the 1.5 kev map of the _ rosat _ all - sky survey , @xcite with the _ heao  1 _",
    "a-2 all - sky survey in 210 kev .",
    "our dipole amplitudes in this direction after the subtraction is @xmath155% ( 1  @xmath11 error ) for the @xmath107 and @xmath156% ( 1  @xmath11 error ) for the @xmath104 .",
    "it is almost impossible to detect such a small level of the dipole ( @xmath157% ) with our data , because the standard deviations of the observed intensity are much higher ( 52% and 6.5% for the @xmath107 and @xmath104 , respectively ) and the number of sample fields are limited to 91 .",
    "the present survey consists of 91 fields distributing in the whole sky , and provides an excellent database .",

    "we conducted a number of simulations to effectively constrain the intensity distribution and spectral properties of the incident sources , including all of these systematic effects .",

    "indeed , these finite sizes of the masking around bright sources or overlapping multipointing implies non - independent data . these effects , however , reconcile with a non - uniform exposure , as long as the source distribution is random , e.g.  clustering of sources in a few arcmin scale can be neglected .",

    "we have also examined a contribution due to the large - scale anisotropy using the dipole analysis , and it is estimated @xmath212 at most . therefore , the observed distribution of @xmath87 is wider than that of the simulation , even though considering the systematic error and the large - scale anisotropy .",
    "this discrepancy is presumably due to the unrealistic assumption that all the sources have a common power - law index of @xmath183 in the simulation .",
    "we investigate this effect later .      in order to determine the _ correct _ cxb intensity in a well - defined flux range , some compensation for the stray light",
    "is required , because the _ asca _ data has a significant flux contribution from outside of the f.o.v .",
    ", where we can not eliminate bright point sources . in the previous subsection , we showed that the assumed @xmath14 @xmath15  relation is in good agreement with the observed intensity and fluctuation of @xmath104 .",
    "we therefore calculated the _",
    "cxb intensity using the assumed @xmath14 @xmath15  relation .",
    "spectral fits for the simulated data indicate that @xmath213 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4  sr@xmath4 .",

    "this is 3.2% less than the simulation value which includes the contribution of bright discrete sources residing outside of the f.o.v .  by chance .",

    "the total cxb flux integrated over @xmath62 was calculated to be @xmath224 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4  sr@xmath4 .",
    "note that this value does not include the soft component , and that the absolute flux determined with _",

    "for example , changing the power - law index , @xmath84 , by only 0.01 causes a shift of normalization at 1 kev by as much as 16% .",
    "we then tried to constrain the acceptable range of the @xmath14 @xmath15  relation based on the analytic dependence of the fluctuation width for a given set of @xmath227 .",
    "the @xmath175 value was determined for each @xmath227 pair , using equation ( [ eq : fs ] ) with @xmath228 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4  sr@xmath4  ( 210 kev ) . according to @xcite ,",
    "the fluctuation width @xmath229 is given analytically as @xmath230 where @xmath231 represents the effective beam size of the xrt+gis system .",
    "if we take the values derived from the simulation , i.e.  @xmath232% , etc . , @xmath231 is calculated to be 0.516  deg@xmath1 . using this @xmath231 value and",

    "since the @xmath85 value is determined by @xmath164 and @xmath163 , namely , the degree of freedom equals two , the 90% confidence range of @xmath229 can be evaluated as @xmath236 . in figure",
    "[ fig : k - npn0]a , we plot the region where the @xmath227 pair gives the 90% confidence range of @xmath229 , as well as that of 68.3% , 95% and 99% . in this plot , we converted @xmath163 into @xmath237 , which represents the @xmath166 value for given @xmath227 at @xmath238 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4 .",
    "the resultant 90% acceptable region of the @xmath14 @xmath15  relation is shown in figure  [ fig : k - npn0]b by the outer solid lines . roughly speaking , this region",
    "is constrained by two factors .",
    "one is a constraint by the fluctuation , which is expressed by the thin solid lines .",
    "the other is a constraint by the absolute cxb intensity shown by the thick solid lines , where the integrated source flux reach 100% of the absolute cxb intensity , when the power - law like @xmath14 @xmath15  relation is extrapolated towards the fainter flux range . in practice ,",
    "the constraint by the fluctuation is valid only in the brighter flux range where the poisson noise , @xmath239 , of the source count , @xmath17 , in the f.o.v .",
    "is comparable to the fluctuation width , i.e. , @xmath240 with our data . on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath14 @xmath15  relation must be within the range of the constraint by the absolute cxb intensity , as long as the @xmath14 @xmath15  curve has a form that is gradually flattening .",
    "although our obtained region is fairly wide , we can further constrain the region by rejecting an unrealistic set of @xmath241 which contradict with the previous results . when combined with the lss and the amss results ( @xcite and 1999b , respectively ) , @xmath166 value at @xmath242",
    "is determined in the range of 3.52  deg@xmath243 @xmath244 @xmath237 @xmath244 4.38  deg@xmath243 .",
    "recent deep observations with _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ show that the flattening of the @xmath14 @xmath15  curve comes out at a fainter flux around ( 12 )  @xmath245 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4   ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "hence , we made another condition of @xmath246 .",
    "if these two conditions are added , the acceptable region of the @xmath227 pair becomes the area surrounded by a rectangle , as shown in figure  [ fig : k - npn0]a , and the acceptable @xmath14 @xmath15  region becomes the area surrounded by the inner solid lines in figure  [ fig : k - npn0]b .",
    "therefore , the @xmath14 @xmath15  relation would reach 100% of the cxb at @xmath247 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4  if there were no flattening , and the source density at @xmath248 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4  is in the range of 190040000 deg@xmath243 .    as a confirmation , we tried a simulation while assuming a bending @xmath14 @xmath15  curve , as shown in figures  [ fig : lognlogssky ] and [ fig : k - npn0]b ( model 2 ) .",
    "the model was acceptable with a fluctuation width of @xmath249  % .",
    "we also confirmed the consistency between the analytic formula , equation ( [ eq : condon ] ) , by running simulations for the boundary values of @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "these results are summarized in table [ tab : lognlogs ] .",
    "as described in subsection [ subsec : cmpobssim ] , the simulation could not reproduce the observed deviation of the cxb spectral index , @xmath84 , whereas both the average value and the deviation of @xmath104 were explained by the simulation fairly well .",
    "this is partly due to the assumption that all of the sources had a common spectral index of @xmath183 in the simulation .",
    "we therefore investigated the dependence of the apparent cxb spectral index upon the intrinsic distribution of the source spectra .    in order to investigate this effect",
    ", we introduced a gaussian distribution of power - law index @xmath250 for those sources which constitute the cxb .",
    "we assumed that the distribution of the source spectra is independent of the source flux .",
    "we chose these assumptions for simplicity , although the actual universe is much more complex .",
    "for instance , hardening of source spectra towards fainter flux range has already been seen in the amss survey ( @xcite ) , and the hard sources are usually heavily absorbed sources ; hence , sources with intrinsically flat spectral indices are rare . however , modeling all of these characteristics is beyond our scope .",
    "the simulation results for several @xmath250 are summarized in table  [ tab : simgamma ] along with the observed ones .",
    "the simulation suggests that the intrinsic deviation of the power - law index , @xmath84 , is more than 1.0 , even when considering the deviation due to the systematic error of the nxb which is estimated to be @xmath251 and the deviation due to the large - scale anisotropy of @xmath252 .",
    "the intrinsic source spectra must peak at significantly harder index of @xmath253 than the observed cxb index of @xmath89 if we suppose that their spectral deviation is about 1.0 .",
    "this is because sources with soft spectra emit more photons than do hard sources when they have the same flux ; consequently , the averaged spectrum tends to be weighted towards the soft source . on the other hand",
    ", we also found that it was difficult to fit the simulated spectrum with a single power - law model for a larger deviation of @xmath250 , since the integrated spectrum became a concave shape .",
    "these funny effects are in part caused by the simplistic model , which is discussed in subsection [ subsec : specfluct ] .",
    "the present _ asca _ observations have shown interesting features in the large - scale distribution of the cxb .",
    "below , we will summarize the main results and address their implications for each subject .      as shown in section [ sec : res ] , the integrated energy spectrum of the 210 kev cxb after the source elimination for the total of 4.2  ms exposure is described by a power - law model with a photon index of @xmath254 ( errors at 90% statistical and systematic ) .",
    "the slope is consistent with many previous measurements . when the nominal nxb is subtracted , the residual from the power - law model suggests a systematic deviation above 8 kev as if the observed spectrum has the cut off as shown in figure  [ fig:2 - 10kev ] .",
    "however , this feature disappears when the nxb level is reduced by 3% within the systematic error .",
    "therefore , we regard that the cut - off feature above 8 kev is not significant . similarly , because the other residual features are all within the nxb uncertainty , we conclude that the energy spectrum of the cxb is consistent with the nominal power - law model in the energy range 210 kev .",
    "the intensity of the power - law component was calculated to be @xmath255 photon  kev@xmath4  @xmath3  s@xmath4  sr@xmath4  at 1 kev after eliminating sources with a flux greater than @xmath256 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4 .",
    "if all the sources brighter than @xmath55 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4  were included , the intensity would become @xmath257 photon  kev@xmath4  @xmath3  s@xmath4  sr@xmath4  at 1 kev , using the compensation factor calculated in subsection [ subsec : cmpstray ] . this value is consistent with the _ asca _ sis result based on a 250 ks exposure in 4 fields , i.e.  @xmath27 photon  kev@xmath4  @xmath3  s@xmath4  sr@xmath4  ( @xcite ) .",
    "note that these absolute fluxes with _",
    "asca _ have systematic errors of @xmath258% because of the calibration uncertainty .",
    "nevertheless , our result is considered to be the best estimate of the cxb intensity so far from two points of view : a well - calibrated and low - background instrument is used , and the source elimination ( @xmath259 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4 ) and large solid angle ( @xmath260 deg@xmath1 ) make the cosmic variance small enough , as expressed in equation ( [ eq : condon ] ) . compared with results from other missions , the present one is consistent with the _ bepposax _ lecs value based on a two thermal plus a power - law model fit ; @xmath28 photon  kev@xmath4  @xmath3  s@xmath4  sr@xmath4  at 1 kev ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , these values are much smaller than the _ rosat _ level of @xmath26 photon  kev@xmath4  @xmath3  s@xmath4  sr@xmath4  at 1 kev ( @xcite ) , even if we include the systematic error in the _ asca _ data .",
    "the relatively strong _ rosat _ flux is caused by the steeper spectrum with @xmath94 , which would be due to contamination of the soft component or the calibration differences ( @xcite ) .",
    "we found that the @xmath115 profiles of both @xmath107 and @xmath104 can be fitted with acceptable @xmath85 values by the finite radius disk model , which strongly suggests that a certain fraction of the x - ray emission has the galactic origin .",
    "as for the soft thermal component ( @xmath107 ) , all of the emission is consistent to be galactic , with a scale height of @xmath261 kpc and a disk radius of @xmath262 kpc ( errors are 1  @xmath11 ) , if we assume the distance to the galactic center to be @xmath263 kpc .",
    "the volume emissivity , @xmath264 , is expressed by @xmath265 where @xmath266 is the height above the plane .",
    "we can compute the total luminosity of the soft component by integrating @xmath264 as @xmath267 hence , @xmath268 erg  s@xmath4 ( 0.52 kev ) .",
    "@xcite derived the total luminosity to be @xmath269 erg  s@xmath4 from the _ rosat _ all - sky survey , which is consistent with our result .",
    "note that the absolute value of @xmath107 is very sensitive to the @xmath97 value , which does vary between 0.14 and 0.7 kev , bringing in a systematic error by about an order in @xmath270 . assuming the mekal model of the temperature @xmath271 kev and the metal abundance at one solar , the electron density in the galactic plane is calculated as @xmath272 @xmath273 .    in the same way , the galactic component in the hard band ( @xmath104 ) is calculated as @xmath274 erg  s@xmath4 ( 210 kev ) ,",
    "although its detection is marginal .",
    "the @xmath104 also showed a weak dipole feature with an amplitude of @xmath150% and the peak position near the galactic center , even though the pointed fields all lie above @xmath275 .",
    "this result remained essentially the same when we simply took the count - rate data above 3 kev instead of the @xmath104 obtained from the spectral fit .",
    "the soft component can be approximated by a thermal model with @xmath276 kev , and even if we take the highest value of @xmath107 detected in the iras  19254@xmath917245 field , the flux contribution above 3 kev is only @xmath277  % .",
    "this suggests that the distribution of the 210 kev x - rays in our galaxy really has a high scale - height component .",
    "essentially the same results were previously reported by @xcite and @xcite with the _ ariel  v _ and _ heao  1 _",
    "a-2 all - sky surveys , respectively .",
    "@xcite recently examined the spatial distribution of the so - called galactic bulge and the ridge x - ray emission , which has a broad enhancement around the galactic center and plane , and showed that the spectrum can be described by a mixture of two thermal components ( @xmath278 kev and @xmath203 kev , respectively ) and a non - thermal power - law component ( @xmath279 ) .",
    "based on an analysis of the _ asca _ and _ rxte _ data , he suggested the typical scale - height / length of the bulge emission to be @xmath280 and @xmath281 .",
    "a comparison with the present result implies that this emission is extending further away ( @xmath38 ) from the galactic center with low surface brightness .",
    "@xcite conducted a deep x - ray survey of a region in the galactic plane with _",
    "acis - i , and found that the hard x - ray emission from the galactic ridge is truly diffuse , not resolved into discrete sources . however , there are difficulties in confining plasmas with such a energy density and temperature in the galactic disk",
    ". the far extended hard x - ray emission in our data may indicate an escape of the high energy plasmas . the spatial distribution determined by the _",
    "rosat _ all - sky survey gives @xmath282 kpc and @xmath283 kpc , which is slightly smaller than our results for the @xmath107 .",
    "this is possibly because the _ rosat _ pspc is sensitive in a softer band than the _ asca _ gis .",
    "based on the observed fluctuation and the absolute intensity of the 210 kev cxb flux compared with the simulation results , the acceptable @xmath14 @xmath15  relation was constrained as shown in figure  [ fig : thelognlogs ] . in the flux range above @xmath284 erg  @xmath3",
    "s@xmath4 , the relation follows the uniform euclidean relation of @xmath285 , as already indicated from the previous observations , and lies on a fainter extension from the previous results from @xmath286 lac ( @xcite ) and _ heao  1 _ a-2 ( @xcite ) . as figure",
    "[ fig : thelognlogs ] clearly shows , the present 90% confidence range of the @xmath14 @xmath15  curve is also consistent with the fainter - part results obtained from the recent _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ deep - survey observations .",
    "we can not say where the turn over exactly occurs , but it is close to the @xmath287@xmath288 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4  level from the derived envelope of figure  [ fig : thelognlogs ] .",
    "@xcite recently analyzed _ chandra _ data for the hubble deep field north with an area of 35.7 arcmin@xmath1 by the fluctuation method .",
    "they derived a loose upper limit in the number density at the flux level of @xmath289 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4  in the 210 kev band to be less than 10000 per square degree .",
    "as figure  [ fig : thelognlogs ] shows , the present _ asca _ result in the same energy band gives a consistent upper limit of @xmath290 per square degree , in the sense that an extrapolation of the @xmath14 @xmath15  curve reaches 100% of the cxb intensity at this point .",
    "the recent _ chandra _ results also suggest an @xmath291 difference in the source contribution brighter than @xmath292 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4  between the cdf - n and the cdf - s fields ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the measured intensity , i.e.  @xmath293 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4  ( cdf - n ) and @xmath294 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4  ( cdf - s ) in 210 kev , have fairly large errors of @xmath258% , and both fields are restricted to relatively small areas ( @xmath295  deg@xmath180 ) . as pointed out by @xcite",
    ", the cosmic variance plays an important role in such small - area observations .",
    "we have shown in section [ sec : lognlogs ] that @xmath296% of the intensity deviation can be reproduced even by a single @xmath14 @xmath15  relation , and that the fluctuation width is inversely proportional to the square root of the observed area , i.e.  @xmath297 from equation ( [ eq : condon ] ) .",
    "considering that the gis+xrt effective beam - size , @xmath231 , is about 0.5 deg@xmath1 , it is not unusual that the intensities of the cdf - n and the cdf - s differ by @xmath291 .",
    "if we take our average value of the cxb intensity integrated up to @xmath62 , i.e.  @xmath224 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4  sr@xmath4 , the fraction of cxb resolved into discrete sources can be @xmath298 in cdf - s and @xmath299 in cdf - n , respectively , although these values do not take into account the uncertainty ( @xmath258% ) of the absolute flux with _",
    "as shown in subsection [ subsec : cmpobssim ] , the observed distribution of @xmath87 indicates @xmath300 .",
    "if we try to explain this in terms of the gaussian distribution of the spectral index of discrete sources , we need to set the intrinsic fluctuation width to be larger than 1.0 ( @xmath301 ) , and a significant fraction of the sources must have a harder spectrum than the cxb with an average of @xmath302 .",
    "this suggests a possibility that faint sources do not distribute along a simple @xmath14 @xmath15  relation , but may consist of two or more different populations .",
    "however , the present spectral fluctuation may be partly coupled with the galactic structure which affects the observed variation of @xmath87 by @xmath303 at the maximum . also , the systematic error on the index caused by the nxb subtraction is 0.025 .",
    "the simulated fluctuation of @xmath87 is @xmath304 for a single @xmath14 @xmath15  curve with an intrinsic @xmath305 ; therefore , the total fluctuation , including the nxb effect , amounts to 0.041 and approaches the observed level .",
    "we also note that the gaussian approximation for the distribution of the spectral index is not adequate .",
    "the actual situation may be that the distribution broadly consists of two components : one corresponds the population of unabsorbed agns with the peak of index distribution around @xmath306 , and the other contains heavily absorbed galaxies with their absorption ranging over a widely different levels .",
    "in fact , several models have been proposed along with this picture , e.g.  by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and they were successful in explaining the spectral shape of the cxb .",
    "however , the distributions of the intrinsic absorption of agn in these models are based on some assumptions and/or limited observations of nearby agns ( e.g.  45 seyferts of @xmath307 in @xcite ) .",
    "because of the observed spectral fluctuation in our result should include all of the contribution from faint distant agns , it remains to be studied whether these models can also reproduce the spectral fluctuation with @xmath308 when observed with a solid angle of @xmath309 deg@xmath1 .",
    "we measured the absolute cxb intensity and its spectrum from 50 square degrees based on the low background data with the _ asca _ gis instrument .",
    "a total of 91 selected fields were studied after eliminating discrete sources with a threshold of @xmath2 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4  ( 210 kev ) .",
    "the energy spectrum in the energy range of 0.710 kev is well described by a two component model comprizing a soft thermal emission with @xmath6 kev and a hard power - law model with photon index @xmath310 ( 1  @xmath11 statistical and systematic errors ) . as for the extragalactic power - law emission ,",
    "the intensity fluctuation is @xmath311 , while the deviation due to the reproducibility of the nxb is 3.2% .",
