    "let s take the common @xmath0 function , its @xmath1 degree taylor polynomial and plot them together , see figure [ fig:00 ] .",
    "we directly observe that the two graphs coincide only for the relatively small interval @xmath2 $ ] , if we compare it with the @xmath3 infinite radius of convergence .",
    "so , when we have a series approximation of a known function around @xmath4 , it is useful to be able to compute an interval with centre @xmath4 such that the function and its approximation practically coincide each other .",
    "many times we have only a truncated part of a general power series , either because the underlying function is unknown or because we simply do not want to take many terms of the known expansion .",
    "the question that arises naturally is ` how far away ' from the central point @xmath5 can we evaluate the truncated series with acceptable accuracy ? or in other words , given a level of accuracy , which is the radius with centre @xmath4 that will make the graphs of the real and the approximate function to ` coincide ' ? . in order to be more rigorous",
    "we have to define the graph coincidence by use of a distance based on a proper norm .",
    "[ def : ecoinc ] let two real functions @xmath6 defined in @xmath7 $ ] and let their graphs @xmath8 for the same interval by using a proper @xmath9-points partition of it .",
    "let @xmath10 be the vectors for the values of @xmath6 at the partition and let @xmath11 a vector norm .",
    "we say that the graphs @xmath12-coincide at @xmath7 $ ] if and only if next inequality holds @xmath13    since we know that a truncated series approximation has its biggest error at the highest distances from centre @xmath4 , i.e. at @xmath14 or @xmath15 it is reasonable to choose the infinity vector norm for computing the distance between the two graphs .",
    "now we can give a formal definition of the @xmath12-effective radius of convergence .",
    "let a truncated power series around @xmath5 be given as the sum @xmath16 which approximates a function @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "then the @xmath12-effective radius of convergence @xmath18 is such that @xmath19 the graphs @xmath20 , @xmath21 @xmath12-coincide .    for the maclaurin power series of sinus we have that @xmath22 if we take @xmath23 we have @xmath24    the graphs of @xmath25 , if we take @xmath26 points at @xmath27 $ ] they @xmath28-coincide , while at interval @xmath29 $ ] they @xmath30 - coincide .",
    "the two relevant plots are given at figure [ fig:01 ] .",
    "the practical question is how can we find a radius such that the two graphs satisfactory coincide , despite the measure of their distance , at least for the beginning . in other words , if we just have a truncated series that we know has come from a smooth function , what is a first estimation for its useful range ? we shall give a method based on the root test criterion for convergence .",
    "since we know that for a convergent power series @xmath32 the radius of convergence is given by @xmath33{\\left|a_n\\right|}}\\ ] ] it is reasonable to argue that , approximately , when @xmath34 is not too small , the [ eq : rdef ] has been reached if we take just the last term of the sequence @xmath35{\\left|a_n\\right|}},\\,\\,n=1,2,\\ldots , m\\right\\rbrace\\ ] ] but we can study further our series since for every function we can find an even and an odd function such that it can be written as the sum of those two parts .",
    "@xmath36 now we can create two series , one with the even powers and another with odd powers .",
    "the same can be done for the truncated series , so for [ eq : pn ] we have that @xmath37 by this procedure we compute the relevant sequences for approximating the radius of convergence of both truncated series as @xmath38{\\left|a_{2n}\\right| } } \\\\ & & \\\\ r_{2n+1}&=&\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[2n+1]{\\left|a_{2n+1}\\right| } } \\\\ \\end{bmatrix }    \\,\\,n=0,1,2,\\ldots\\ ] ] finally we have two sets of values and if our approximation comes from a convergent series then both of them have to convergence to the same and true radius @xmath39 .",
    "by the ` convergence ' here we actually mean the last term of every [ eq : reo ] sequence , so our estimators are @xmath40 where @xmath41 are defined from the last even and odd term respectively of the truncated series .",
    "if the underlying function is even , then the sequence for the even truncated series has to be taken , otherwise if it is odd we examine the odd sequence .",
    "another well known property of convergent power series is that their @xmath31 term has to vanish as @xmath42 , so we have a second check for the choice of the convergent sequence between the even and the odd one : we can disregard the series that comes from a divergent subset of coefficients .      if we observe that @xmath43{\\left|a_n\\right|}={\\left|a_n\\right|}^{\\frac{1}{n}}\\ ] ] or @xmath44 we can obtain the @xmath45 via ols estimation for the data @xmath46 , \\,\\,\\forall a_n\\neq{0}\\right\\}\\ ] ] and then find an estimation for the radius of convergence as @xmath47 in this method sometimes it is better to first plot all data [ eq : datrr ] in order to decide which subset of it has a better linear behaviour and then do ols only for that .",
    "let s illustrate our methods by studying a set of functions , even , odd or without parity .",
    "let s examine the normal distribution pdf at interval @xmath48 $ ] by both two methods .",
    "the function and its taylor polynomial of degree 10 are @xmath49    * the sequence of even estimations is @xmath50\\ ] ] so we find @xmath51 which is figure [ fig:02 ] . * the ols estimation is @xmath52 the linear data used are shown at figure [ fig:03a ] while the plots for @xmath53 $ ] is figure [ fig:03b ] .",
    "+ we can find that @xmath54 , which gives a very small error , but our useful range has decreased too much .",
    "let s examine the sinus function with both methods .",
    "* our odd sinus function [ eq : sin ] and its truncated series [ eq : sin11 ] gives as the sequence of odd estimations @xmath55\\ ] ] so we directly find @xmath56 which is just what we have already observed at figure [ fig:00 ] .",
    "* the ols estimation is @xmath57 which came from an almost perfect straight line shown at figure [ fig:04a ] while the plots for the interval @xmath58 $ ] is figure [ fig:04b ] . for this approximation",
    "we have that @xmath59 which again gives a very small error as compensating us for the smaller useful range .",
    "let s study now a more complicated function which is not even or odd , see @xcite for more details .",
    "we find that the effective radius of convergence is @xmath60 as clearly is shown at figure [ fig:05 ] .",
    "+ we can also compute the relevant ols estimation and find that is @xmath61 , which is less useful since it is only approximately the @xmath62 of the root test based one .",
    "an interesting note has to be done here about the relationship between the real radius of convergence and the effective radius that we compute via the sequences [ eq : rndef ] and [ eq : reo ] .    as an example we shall try to find the @xmath63 of a @xmath64-function according to @xcite notation : @xmath65 if we take its @xmath66 degree taylor polynomial and compute our sequence [ eq : rndef ] we see that it convergences to the true radius of convergence @xmath67 as is presented at figure [ fig:06a ] while @xmath68 is shown at figure [ fig:06b ] .",
    "the ols estimation is @xmath69 and for the interval @xmath70 $ ] the function and its taylor approximation are indistinguishable , see figure [ fig:06c ] .",
    "we saw that for every truncated taylor power series we can find two radius , one based directly on a root test sequence and another using a proper ols linear regression on those values .",
    "the first one always gives the greatest range @xmath71 $ ] where we can plot our function @xmath72 and its taylor polynomial @xmath73 with almost identical curves .",
    "the second gives a more restrictive range , but with very small error measured by @xmath74 norm .",
    "+ we have also found that our effective radius of convergence , if we take the degree of the taylor polynomial sufficiently large , is a rough estimation of the true non - infinite radius of convergence ."
