    "in newtonian theory , there are two basic methods of analysing the motion of a test mass under the attraction of a central , spherically symmetric gravitational field : either hamiltonian mechanics is applied to solve the problem in a spherical polar coordinate system or , for bound orbits , one may invoke a canonical transformation to action - angle variables . in the latter case , solving the _ hamilton - jacobi _ differential equation yields the integrals of motion and , in particular , _",
    "kepler s third law _ which for elliptical orbits , in geometric units , reads  @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the angular frequency of orbital revolution , @xmath7 is the eccentricity of the orbit , @xmath11 its semi - major axis and @xmath12 is the mass which acts as the source of the central field .",
    "a generalisation of the hamilton - jacobi method to the relativistic motion of a test mass in kerr spacetime , as proposed by carter  @xcite , shows that the motion is still separable and there is a complete set of constants of motion : the energy @xmath0 as measured by an observer at spatial infinity , the axial angular momentum component @xmath1 and the carter constant @xmath2 .",
    "whereas @xmath0 and @xmath1 reflect isometries of the spacetime geometry , @xmath2 arises from the separation of the radial and polar components of motion .",
    "the resulting first - order equations of motion can be used to compute the particle s worldline and , in limiting cases such as circular and equatorial orbits , to calculate periods of motion .",
    "however , no attempt has been made yet to formulate a relativistic generalisation of action - angle variables for geodesic motion in kerr spacetime and to calculate the dynamical frequencies of arbitrary bound non - plunging orbits .",
    "exactly these frequencies would be relevant to the computation of gravitational radiation emitted by stellar - mass compact objects in the vicinity of super - massive black holes if a perturbation theory based on the adiabatic approximation is employed . in this approximation one",
    "considers the motion as being nearly geodesic under the assumption that the time scale of radiation reaction , @xmath13 , is much larger than the dynamical time scales @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 of the three components of orbital motion .",
    "recently , hughes  @xcite has raised the question what time scales should , in general , be chosen for @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , as there is no obvious way of calculating orbital periods from the integrals of motion if the orbit is neither circular nor equatorial .    in the following",
    ", it is shown that suitable action - angle variables can be formulated within a fully relativistic framework for general orbits in kerr spacetime and formulas for dynamical frequencies in terms of numerically solvable integrals are derived .",
    "let us first review the procedure applied by carter  @xcite in order to determine the constants of motion .",
    "we define the relativistic hamiltonian for geodesic motion of a particle that possesses no spin in a spacetime with given metric in the absence of an electromagnetic field as  @xcite @xmath17 in this equation , the metric components @xmath18 are considered to be functions of the coordinates @xmath19 and the quantities @xmath20 are the conjugate momenta of the particle associated with these coordinates . substituting the contravariant components @xmath18 of the kerr metric in the boyer - lindquist coordinate representation  @xcite , the explicit form of the hamiltonian",
    "is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "a complete set of constants of motion can be determined if a canonical transformation @xmath24 is found such that the hamiltonian becomes cyclic in all of the new generalised coordinates @xmath25 , i.e. , @xmath26 , and the transformed momenta @xmath27 are thus conserved along the worldline of the particle .",
    "the generator of such a canonical transformation , @xmath28 , is called the _",
    "characteristic function _ and is determined by the _ hamilton - jacobi _ differential equation @xmath29 solving this equation , yields three constants of integration , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , apart from @xmath30 , the value of the hamiltonian evaluated along the worldline of the particle .",
    "the transformed conjugate momenta @xmath27 can be chosen as any functions of the these constants , i.e. , @xmath31 , assuming that @xmath32 is bijective and @xmath33 , and the generalised coordinates @xmath34 are obtained from hamilton s equations of motion , @xmath35 where each @xmath36 is a constant .",
    "the generalised coordinates are therefore given by @xmath37 if the hamiltonian is cyclic in all of these coordinates .",
    "for geodesic motion in kerr spacetime , the constants of motion @xmath38 and @xmath39 are related to the isometries of the metric in the coordinates @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 can be interpreted , respectively , as the particle s energy and axial angular momentum component as seen by an observer at spatial infinity .",
    "the third constant of motion , @xmath2 , is obtained by separating radial and polar motion and is called _",
    "carter s constant_. in terms of @xmath42 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the characteristic function @xmath43 is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 ^ 2               - \\delta[\\mu^2 r^2+(l_{z}-a e)^2+q ] , \\\\",
    "\\label{eq : capt_theta }    \\theta & = q - \\left[(\\mu^2-e^2)a^2               + \\frac{l_{z}^2}{\\sin^2\\theta}\\right]\\cos^2\\theta.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath46 , the following set of first - order equations of motion is obtained  @xcite : @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "if the conjugate momenta are chosen such that the hamiltonian becomes identically equal to @xmath49 , i.e. , @xmath50 , then we obtain @xmath51 and @xmath52 . substituting the characteristic function into the identities @xmath53 and @xmath54 and adjusting the constants @xmath55 in a suitable way , we find the following well - known integrals of motion  @xcite : @xmath56 and , finally , @xmath57 in general , there are distinct turning points of the radial and polar motions which are asynchronously passed by the particle because @xmath58 and @xmath59 are not periodic functions of time . in consequence ,",
    "equation  ( [ eq : intgr_coord_time ] ) evaluates to different intervals of coordinate time when integrating over various cycles of radial or polar motion and , for this reason , there is no obvious way of calculating the time scales @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 from the above integrals .",
    "even though it might seem that there is no useful notion of orbital frequencies if the coordinate functions representing the motion are not periodic , it is still possible to find a representation in which _ complete periodicity _ becomes manifest .",
    "however , such a representation is not found by means of a coordinate transformation in the usual sense , but by virtue of the more general concept of a _ canonical transformation _ of both spacetime coordinates and conjugate momenta . by its definition , a canonical transformation acts on the cotangential bundle @xmath60 of kerr spacetime , as opposed to a pure coordinate transformation between charts on the basis manifold @xmath61 . in analogy to phase space trajectories in non - relativistic hamiltonian mechanics , let us consider the locus of all points in @xmath60 which are passed by a particle in the course of its motion along a particular orbit .",
    "we shall denote the image of that set under the coordinate chart corresponding to boyer - lindquist coordinates @xmath19 and their conjugate momenta @xmath20 by @xmath62 for a given set of constants of motion .",
    "the basic topological properties of @xmath62 in the case of a bound orbit of the first kind can be readily inferred from the equations determining the conjugate momenta , @xmath63 firstly , since the orbital revolution progresses continuously in time , @xmath62 is not compact in timelike directions .",
    "secondly , the motion is bound both in the @xmath64- and in the @xmath65-domain . moreover , since @xmath66 is solely a function of @xmath64 and , likewise , @xmath67 is a function of @xmath65 only , both radial and polar motion are of compact support and of the libration type provided that the orbit is _ bound _ and _ stable_. otherwise , the orbit either plunges and , hence , the particle approaches the horizon towards future timelike infinity or , if the orbit is only marginally stable , it asymptotically approached the inner turning point .",
    "thirdly , the azimuthal motion is a rotation and , of course , it is of compact support as well because @xmath68 is to be identified with @xmath69 .",
    "according to a theorem by arnold  @xcite , that was formulated in the framework of non - relativistic mechanics , the phase space trajectory of a _ fully integrable _ system of @xmath70 degrees of freedom is diffeomorphic to the @xmath70-torus @xmath71 whenever the motion of the system is of _ compact support_. it seems plausible , that this theorem is applicable to relativistic problems as well if we account for the distinct role of the timelike coordinate which is related to the non - compactness of the worldline of a particle . accordingly , as a manifestation of the weak equivalence principle , geodesic motion in kerr spacetime has only three _",
    "physical _ degrees of freedom because orbits are the same regardless of the mass @xmath42 of the particle .",
    "since @xmath62 is defined with respect to a particular coordinate system , there is a well defined notion of projecting this set in the directions of the pair of conjugate variables @xmath72 .",
    "the resulting projected set , @xmath73 , resides in the six - dimensional space spanned by the spacelike conjugate pairs @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 and corresponds to a phase space . indeed , from the topological considerations in the previous paragraph , we see that @xmath73 is diffeomorphic to the three - torus @xmath77 .",
    "utilising this toroidal topology , let us now define for each spatial component a closed curve @xmath78 which circumscribes the @xmath79-th torus and can be contracted into a single point with respect to the other tori . if @xmath80 is the coordinate chart on the cotangential bundle producing the boyer - lindquist coordinates and its conjugate momenta , then @xmath81 is the pre - image of the @xmath79-th loop in @xmath60 . furthermore , if we note that the _",
    "canonical one - form _ of hamiltonian mechanics , @xmath82 , is the one - form corresponding to the relativistic four - momentum @xmath83 , i.e. , @xmath84 then we can define an _ action variable _",
    "@xmath85 for the @xmath79-th spatial component as @xmath86 it might appear that such an action variable ultimately depends on the choice of the closed curve @xmath87 which is defined with respect to a particular coordinate system and , thus , one would assume that it is not a geometric invariant . however , @xmath85 is independent of the shape of @xmath87 because @xmath88 is _ closed _ on @xmath89 , i.e. , @xmath90 .",
    "the closedness of the canonical one - form is shown by substituting the expressions  ( [ eq : conj_momenta ] ) for the conjugate momenta and applying the rules of exterior differentiation .",
    "the generalised stokes theorem then yields the desired property of @xmath85  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , since transformations between coordinate charts preserve topological features , we could have defined the curves @xmath87 with respect to any coordinate system and then found their pre - images in @xmath60 .",
    "it is only the topological features of @xmath87 with respect to the three - torus that matters !",
    "therefore we conclude that the action variables  ( [ eq : action_var ] ) are , indeed , geometric invariants . for convenience ,",
    "however , we shall denote these variables as @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 as if they were specific for the boyer - lindquist coordinate system .",
    "since motion in kerr spacetime is separable in the coordinates @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath41 , we may choose each @xmath87 such that it is located completely within the @xmath94-plane .",
    "then the action variables can be easily calculated from cyclic integrals over the spatial conjugate momenta in the boyer - lindquist coordinate representation : @xmath95 as can be seen from the above expressions , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 are functions of the mass @xmath42 and the three constants of motion @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the generator of the transformation to the action variables @xmath85 is given by @xmath96 .",
    "it is not globally defined , but changes by an amount of @xmath97 when integrating over the path @xmath87 . as a consequence ,",
    "if the spatial coordinate @xmath98 goes through @xmath70 complete cycles and the other coordinates are kept unchanged , then the generalised coordinate @xmath99 associated with @xmath85 changes by @xmath100 .",
    "this result implies that @xmath101 is a phase or _",
    "angle variable _ and , since @xmath102 , the constant @xmath103 can be interpreted as a frequency . moreover , as a consequence of the geometrically invariant definition of the action variables @xmath85 , the frequencies @xmath103 specify fundamental properties of the orbital motion independent of any particular coordinate representation .",
    "therefore , they are called the _ fundamental frequencies _ of the system .",
    "however , these frequencies are subject to a straightforward physical interpretation only with respect to the spatial coordinates @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath41 , when the paths @xmath87 are correspondingly chosen as cycles of , respectively , radial , polar and azimuthal motion . accordingly",
    ", we shall use the notation @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 for the fundamental frequencies of an orbit in kerr spacetime .",
    "the standard procedure of determining fundamental frequencies is to find the explicit form of the hamiltonian in the action - angle representation , @xmath104 , and to calculate the frequencies from the partial derivatives with respect to the action variables @xmath85  @xcite : @xmath105 unfortunately , the definition of the radial and polar action variables in terms of the non - trivial integrals  ( [ eq : action_var_r ] ) and  ( [ eq : action_var_theta ] ) does not admit an explicit inversion because none of these integrals can be solved analytically .",
    "however , as is shown in [ sct : determ_freq ] , the derivatives @xmath106 and , hence , the frequencies @xmath103 can be found even without knowing the functional form of the hamiltonian @xmath104 if the theorem on implicit functions is employed .",

    "for this reason , we will cast these equations into a dimensionless scale - invariant form , in which @xmath42 does not appear anymore .",
    "secondly , the radial functions @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 are not proper integrals because the integrated functions are divergent at the turning points @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "fortunately , they are transformed into well - behaved integrals by virtue of the substitution @xmath127 , where @xmath128 varies from @xmath129 to @xmath130 as @xmath64 goes through a complete cycle .",

    "although analytical expressions for these functions can be derived , it is hardly feasible to substitute these expressions for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . for given orbital parameters ,",
    "it is much easier to calculate the constants of motion numerically , as explained in [ sct : const_of_motion ] , and to substitute the resulting values into @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",

    "for this reason , one would expect that @xmath153 is in some sense an interval of coordinate time .",
    "however , it can not be equal to @xmath155 as equation  ( [ eq : intgr_coord_time ] ) tells us that the relation between the elapse of proper time @xmath156 and the corresponding interval of coordinate time , @xmath155 , is not linear .",
    "on the other hand , there are three particular scales of proper time , @xmath157 , @xmath158 and @xmath159 , associated with the three fundamental frequencies , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 . substituting each of these constants into the expression for @xmath153 , three scales of _",
    "coordinate time _",
    "are produced : @xmath160 this seems to be a natural definition of the coordinate - time scales associated with the fundamental frequencies .",
    "as we shall see in following section , the above definition , indeed , reproduces the known periods of coordinate time in the limits of , respectively , circular and equatorial motion .",
    "hence , we are led to the conjecture that @xmath148 can be interpreted as a _ gravitational lorentz factor _ which relates the three dynamical scales of proper time , @xmath157 , @xmath158 and @xmath159 , to the corresponding intervals of coordinate time , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .    in the general case , this conjecture has the following implication : the ratio of time scales associated with two particular components of motion , say , radial and polar motion , is the same regardless of the frame of reference in which these time scales are defined .",
    "for example , if an observer at infinity saw the intervals of time @xmath14 and @xmath15 , he would find that the ratio @xmath161 is equal to @xmath162 .",
    "of course , this is exactly what one would expect , provided that the fundamental frequencies truly arise from invariant properties of orbital motion . in conclusion",
    ", the ratio of time scales should be independent of the frame of reference in use .",
    "with respect to coordinate time @xmath40 , this is inherently ensured by the above definition of @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .    ultimately , the significance of the fundamental frequencies lies in the possibility of expanding a dynamical quantity @xmath163 in a fourier series with harmonics @xmath164 of these frequencies  @xcite : @xmath165 where @xmath166 and @xmath167 according to definition of the action variables @xmath168 , @xmath169 and @xmath170 . the fourier coefficients @xmath171 of the above expansion are given by @xmath172 therefore , dynamical properties of the particle are completely specified by discrete sets of numbers such as @xmath173 .",
    "this is the very essence of bound geodesic orbital motion in a kerr spacetime being _ quasi - periodic _ rather than quasi - chaotic , as was proposed due to the ergodic properties of these orbits .",
    "as an important test to support the validity of the fundamental frequencies derived in the previous section , we will consider two special cases of bound motion in kerr spacetime : firstly , the limit of vanishing eccentricity and , secondly , purely equatorial orbits .",
    "in particular , we will see that previously derived equations for the periods and the corresponding azimuthal angles of circular orbits  @xcite can be reproduced from the general formulas .",
    "briefly summarised , the features of orbits in the two limiting cases are as follows :    * circular orbits ( @xmath7 = 0 ) : in schwarzschild spacetime , kepler s third law  ( [ eq : kepler ] ) holds exactly for the period of azimuthal revolution with respect to coordinate time , i.e. , @xmath174 . for circular orbits in kerr spacetime , there are two distinct frequencies depending on whether the particle co - revolves or counter - revolves with the rotation of the black hole . if the motion is not confined to the equatorial plane , then the particle changes periodically its altitude such that @xmath175 is twice the elapse of proper time between two subsequent passages of the particle through the equatorial plane .",
    "the frequencies @xmath4 and @xmath5 are generally incommensurate . as a consequence ,",
    "the azimuthal angle @xmath176 that is accumulated as the particle completes a cycle of polar motion is different from @xmath130 . * equatorial orbits ( @xmath177 ) : as a consequence of the different shape of the potential of radial motion as compared to the newtonian potential , non - circular orbits do not close on themselves as the particle revolves around the gravitational centre . the total azimuthal angle",
    "@xmath178 swept out by the particle as it moves from , say , the apastron at radius @xmath179 to the periastron at radius @xmath180 and back to the apastron is given by @xmath181 .",
    "actually , there is another limit , called polar orbits , for which @xmath182 . in this case",
    ", the particle crosses the spin axis of the black hole and the inclination parameter is @xmath183 .",
    "however , it seems unlikely that polar orbits are astrophysically relevant and we only refer to @xcite for a general discussion .",
    "orbits of zero eccentricity , @xmath184 , are called circular . in this case , the particle moves on a spherical surface of constant radial coordinate , @xmath185 , within the bounds of the inclination @xmath65 given by @xmath186 .",

    "the integrals given by equations  ( [ eq : rad_integr_x])([eq : rad_integr_z ] ) and  ( [ eq : rad_integr_w ] ) are undefined in the limit of vanishing eccentricity .",
    "the corresponding quantities in the @xmath128-representation , however , have well - defined limits because the functions @xmath151 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 are constant if @xmath184 .",

    "substitution of the above asymptotic expressions into equations  ( [ eq : freq_r])([eq : freq_phi ] ) and  ( [ eq : gamma ] ) results in @xmath218 the three components of motion therefore become commensurate in the newtonian limit and the corresponding frequencies asymptotically degenerate . in the nearly newtonian regime , where the three frequencies are close to @xmath10 yet slightly different from each other , we expect that there will be a minute perihelion drift ( due to the small difference between @xmath5 and @xmath3 ) as well as a slow precession of the orbital plane ( due to the difference between @xmath5 and @xmath4 ) . in order to calculate this precession , an approximation of the fundamental frequencies including terms of next lower order in @xmath6 would be required .",
    "however , this is left for future work .",
    "let us now consider bound orbits around a nearly extreme kerr black hole of spin @xmath219 .",
    "such a black hole is particularly interesting because effects due to spacetime dragging caused by the high angular momentum of the black hole are strong and stable orbits exist even very close to the horizon ( which is located at @xmath220 ) .",
    "subsequently , we will explore the parameter space in all three dimensions and analyse the behaviour of the fundamental frequencies as each of the orbital parameters is varied .",
    "the numerical evaluation of equations  ( [ eq : freq_r])([eq : freq_phi ] ) and a general algorithm to calculate the constants of motion @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 for arbitrary orbital parameters @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 was implemented in mathematica .    to begin with , we choose @xmath221 ( in this case the aphelion radius is twice the perihelion radius ) and @xmath222 ( corresponding to @xmath223 of maximum altitude from the equatorial plane ) .",
    "the fundamental frequencies of the prograde and retrograde orbits as functions of @xmath6 are shown in figure  [ fg : freq_p ] . basically , one can see that the frequencies @xmath224 , @xmath225 and @xmath226 increasingly deviate from each other as the distance from the black hole becomes smaller . for increasing @xmath6 ,",
    "on the other hand , the fundamental frequencies tend to degenerate and , in fact , they converge towards the keplerian frequency @xmath227 for @xmath221 . thus",
    ", we call the keplerian power law for given eccentricity the _ asymptotic keplerian branch _ of the fundamental frequencies .",
    "the values of @xmath6 , for which the frequencies of , respectively , prograde and retrograde orbits diverge , are located exactly where the respective orbits become _ marginally stable_. in this case , stable prograde orbits only exist if @xmath228 and stable retrograde orbits only if @xmath229 .",
    "hence , the corresponding minimal perihelion radii of stable prograde and retrograde orbits with @xmath221 and @xmath222 are , respectively , @xmath230 and @xmath231 .",
    "note that @xmath232 and @xmath233 as @xmath234 .",
    "this is a consequence of the orbits becoming `` zoom whirls '' which means that the particle moves from the apastron inwards and then revolves many times along an almost circular spiral before it actually reaches the periastron . in the limit of a marginally stable orbit ,",
    "the periastron is approached asymptotically .",
    "the elapse of proper time as the particle moves from apastron to periastron , thus , ever increases as @xmath234 and the radial frequency approaches zero .",
    "if the particle represents an astrophysical object , however , radiation reaction will finally act on a time scale that is comparable to the dynamical time scale of radial motion ( @xmath235 ) and , as a consequence , it will drive the particle within finite time over the stability threshold so that it plunges into the black hole .",
    "in parameter space , the locus of all points corresponding to marginally stable orbits , @xmath236 , is called the _",
    "separatrix_. a plot of the separatrix for @xmath219 is shown in figure  [ fg : sptrx ] , where the perihelion radius @xmath180 is used as parameter in place of @xmath6 .",
    "there are two sheets , one corresponding to prograde marginally stable orbits and the other one corresponding to retrograde marginally stable orbits .",
    "the two sheets smoothly join at @xmath237 , i.e. , where the polar orbits with @xmath238 are located .",
    "as @xmath140 becomes smaller , however , there is an increasing space between the two sheets , in which only prograde but no retrograde orbits reside . as the eccentricity increases , both prograde and retrograde orbits exist closer to the horizon due to the higher momentum of the particle at the periastron as compared to circular orbits of the same radius . in particular , there are prograde orbits of eccentricity @xmath239 with @xmath240 for which the periastron is very close to the horizon ( within @xmath241 ) .",
    "figure  [ fg : freq_e ] shows the change of the fundamental frequencies with eccentricity for various choices of @xmath8 and @xmath6 .",
    "the main feature of these plots is the convergence of the frequencies to a single value as @xmath242 .",
    "this simply reflects the fact that orbits of eccentricity very close to unity are almost unbound and the apastron is located far away from the region of strong gravity . in consequence",
    ", the particle is mostly moving in the nearly newtonian regions of spacetime and the fundamental frequencies tend to degenerate . in the plot showing the frequencies of nearly polar orbits with @xmath243 and @xmath244 ,",
    "the frequencies terminate just below @xmath245 as prograde orbits of higher eccentricity do not exist if @xmath246 ( note that the value of the perihelion radius depends on @xmath7 according to @xmath247 when comparing to the plot of the separatrix in figure  [ fg : sptrx ] ) .",
    "the dependence of the fundamental frequencies on the inclination parameter @xmath8 ( which is the smallest angle of inclination to the spin axis of the black hole that can be reached by the particle ) is shown in figure  [ fg : freq_z ] for different values of @xmath7 and @xmath6 .",
    "apparently , both the radial and polar frequencies of prograde and retrograde orbits converge towards each other as @xmath248 , i.e. , in the polar limit . on the other hand",
    ", there is a crossing - over of the azimuthal frequencies at some finite value of @xmath8 . as a consequence ,",
    "the azimuthal motion of nearly polar retrograde orbits is _ faster _ than that of the corresponding prograde orbits and , thus , it seems that nearly polar orbits are markedly different from nearly equatorial orbits .",
    "we have to keep in mind , however , that the revolution of the particle around the black hole in the case @xmath249 is rather specified by the polar frequency @xmath4 , whereas @xmath5 determines an azimuthal precession around the spin axis of the black hole .",
    "finally , in figure  [ fg : time_p ] , the scales of coordinate time , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , defined by equation  [ eq : coord_time_scl ] are shown in physical units as functions of the semi - major axis @xmath250 for orbits of eccentricity @xmath221 and inclination parameter @xmath222 .",
    "the mass of the black hole is chosen to be @xmath251 which is about the mass determined for the black hole in the centre of our galaxy  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that for virtually all prograde orbits the time scale of polar motion @xmath16 is very close to the the keplerian orbital period @xmath252 .",
    "however , this is only accidentally the case for the chosen set of parameters , as for lower eccentricity @xmath16 is above @xmath253 , whereas it tends to become significantly smaller than @xmath253 at higher eccentricity .",
    "the investigation of bound geodesic orbits in kerr spacetime presented in this article clearly illustrates that the properties of these orbits in the regime of strong gravity are profoundly different from keplerian orbits in the newtonian regime .",
    "in particular , there are three different frequencies of orbital motion , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which increasingly deviate from the keplerian frequency as the size of the orbit decreases and finally approaches the limit of a marginally stable orbit .",
    "this is a consequence of the radial , polar and azimuthal components of motion being _ incommensurate _ in kerr spacetime . as a consequence ,",
    "the shapes of orbits in the vicinity of a kerr black hole are exceedingly complex .    the explicit formulas for the fundamental frequencies @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 presented in section  [ sct : fund_freq ] are exact in the test particle limit and useful approximations if radiation reaction is _ adiabatic _ ,",
    "i.e. , if the time scales associated with the frequencies are small compared to the time scale of radiation reaction . based on the constant of motion @xmath148 which is associated with a timelike generalised coordinate , we have proposed a conversion of the invariant fundamental frequencies into coordinate - time scales , @xmath14 , @xmath16 and @xmath15 , which should be relevant to an observer at spatial infinity and , thus , gravitational wave astronomy . once these time scales are established , one can compute _ instantaneous _ gravitational wave forms in the adiabatic approximation . in this context , the term `` instantaneous '' means an interval of time , over which no significant changes of the constants of motion are accumulated due to radiation reaction . from the resulting spectrum , an estimation of the power emitted in the frequency band of a detector could be made , without making use of an advanced theory of radiation reaction .",
