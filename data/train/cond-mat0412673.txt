    "the magnetotransport of the 2deg , subjected to periodic potential modulations , has attracted considerable experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite attention during the last two decades . for one - dimensional ( 1d ) modulations novel oscillations of the magnetoresistivity tensor @xmath3",
    "have been observed , at low magnetic fields @xmath0 , distinctly different in period and temperature dependence from the usual shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) ones observed at higher @xmath0 .",
    "these novel oscillations , referred to as the weiss oscillations , reflect the commensurability between two length scales : the cyclotron diameter at the fermi level @xmath4 , with @xmath5 the electron density and @xmath6 the magnetic length , and @xmath7 the period of the potential modulation .",
    "the emerging field of spintronics brought into the fore the importance of spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) in a variety of situations .",
    "it is important in the development of spin - based transistors @xcite , possibly in future quantum computations @xcite , in an unexpected metal - to - insulator transition in 2d @xcite hole gas , in spin - resolved ballistic transport @xcite , in aharonov - casher experiments @xcite , in spin - galvanic @xcite and spin valve @xcite effects , in the spin - hall effect @xcite , etc .",
    "the effect is important in inversely asymmetric bulk semiconductor crystals , due to the internal crystal field , as well in asymmetrically confined semiconductor heterostructures . in the former case the contributions to the spin splitting in the conduction band vary as a @xmath8 term and dominate in _ wide - gap _ structures @xcite whereas in the latter vary as a @xmath9 term , referred to as the rashba term , and dominate in _ narrow - gap _ structures @xcite .",
    "the latter was confirmed by experiments that showed a zero - magnetic - field spin splitting for carriers with finite momentum in a modulation - doped gaas / algaas heterojunction @xcite as well as by magnetotransport measurements in a 2d hole system @xcite .",
    "the explanation proposed by bychkov and rashba @xcite employed the rashba spin - orbit hamiltonian , in which the spin of finite - momentum electrons feels a magnetic field perpendicular to the electron momentum in the inversion plane . a detailed account of magnetotransport of the 2deg in the presence of soi but absence of modulations appeared recently @xcite .",
    "given the importance the soi has acquired , one question that arises concerns its influence on magnetotransport properties of a 2deg in the presence of periodic potential modulations .",
    "so far we are aware of only the brief , _ classical _ study of ref .",
    "since some effects of the modulations can be explained only quantum mechanically @xcite , it is of interest to reexamine the problem _",
    "quantum mechanically_. this is the subject of this paper .",
    "we will consider only weak 1d modulations and make use of our experience with them @xcite and with the unmodulated 2deg in the presence of soi @xcite .",
    "the main qualitative findings are as follows .",
    "the levels of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 , unequally spaced energy branches , due to the soi when the modulation is absent , broaden into bands when the modulation is present and their bandwidths oscillate with the field @xmath0 .",
    "evaluated at the fermi energy , these bandwidths vanish at different values of the field @xmath0 and modify considerably the flat - band condition and the transport coefficients as a function of the soi strength @xmath2 . as a result ,",
    "the phase and amplitude of the commensurability and sdh oscillations change when @xmath2 is varied . for small values of @xmath2",
    "the former show a beating pattern while for strong values of @xmath2 the latter are split in two .    in the next section we present the one - electron eigenfunctions and eigenvalues .",
