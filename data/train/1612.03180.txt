    "the intricate formation of the large scale structure of the present - day universe is formed by an interplay between random gaussian fluctuations and gravitational instability . when gravitational instabilities start dominating the dynamical evolution of the matter content of the universe , the structure formation evolves from a linear to a highly nonlinear regime . in this framework , voids are formed in minima and haloes are formed in maxima of the same primordial gaussian field , and later on these features present different type dynamical evolutions due to their initial conditions in the nonlinear regime .",
    "this fact has been known since early studies that showed voids are integral features of the universe @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that the distribution of voids can be affected by their environments . as a result",
    ", the void size distribution may play a crucial role to understand the dynamical processes affecting the structure formation of the universe @xcite .",
    "the early statistical models of void probability functions ( vpfs ) @xcite are based on the counts in randomly placed cells following the prescription of @xcite .",
    "apart from vpfs , the number density of voids is another key statistic to obtain the void distribution .",
    "recently @xcite show that void size distributions obtained from the cosmic void catalog ( cvc ) satisfy a @xmath0-parameter log - normal probability function .",
    "this is particularly interesting , because observations and theoretical models based on numerical simulations of galaxy distributions @xcite show that the galaxy mass distribution satisfies a log - normal function rather than a gaussian .",
    "taking into account that voids are integral features of the universe , it may be expected to obtain a similar distribution profile for voids . apart from this , @xcite discuss a possible quantitative relation between the shape parameters of the void size distribution and the environmental affects .    following up on the study of @xcite , we here extend their analysis of void size distributions to all simulated and mock samples of cvc of @xcite .",
    "the three main catalogs under study are dark matter , halo and galaxy catalogs .",
    "therefore , we confirm that the system of @xmath0-parameter log - normal distribution obtained by @xcite provides a fairly satisfactory model of the size distribution of voids .",
    "in addition to this , we obtain equations which satisfy linear relations between maximum tree depth and the shape parameters of the void size distribution as proposed by @xcite .",
    "extending the study by @xcite , we here fully investigate the void size distribution function statistically in simulations and mocks catalogs of the public cvc of @xcite .",
    "it is useful to note that all the data of cvc are used here generated from a @xmath2 cold dark matter ( @xmath2cdm ) n - body simulation by using an adaptive treecode 2hot @xcite .",
    "in addition , in all data sets voids are identified with the modified version of the parameter - free void finder zobov @xcite .",
    "the data sets of cvc , we used here , can be categorized into three main groups ;    * dark matter ( dm ) simulations are dm full , dm dense and dm sparse .",
    "although these dark matter simulations have the same cosmological parameters from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) seven year data release ( dr@xmath3 ) @xcite as well as the same snapshot at z=0 , they have different tracer densities of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 particles per @xmath7 which are respectively dm full , dm dense , and dm sparse .",
    "also the minimum effective void radii @xmath8 and @xmath9 mpc / h are obtained from the simulations for dm full , dm dense and dm sparse respectively .",
    "* halo catalog in which two halo populations are generated ; haloes dense and haloes sparse . in the halo catalog the halo positions are used as tracers to find voids .",
    "the minimum resolvable halo mass of haloes dense is @xmath10 @xmath11 while the minimum resolvable halo mass of haloes sparse data set is @xmath12 @xmath11 . in addition , the minimum effective void radii of haloes dense and sparse are @xmath13 mpc / h respectively . the main reason to construct these halo populations with different minimum resolvable halo masses is to compare the voids in halos to voids in relatively dense galaxy environments , see @xcite for more details . * galaxy catalogues",
    "; there are two galaxy mock catalogues which are produced from the above halo catalog by using the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) code of @xcite and the hod model by @xcite .",
    "these galaxy mock catalogs are called hod dense and hod sparse @xcite .",
    "the hod dense catalog has @xmath14 voids with effective minimum radii @xmath15 mpc / h and includes relatively high - resolution galaxy samples with density @xmath5 dark matter particles per cubic mpc / h matching the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) dr@xmath3 main sample @xcite using one set of parameters found by @xcite ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) .",
    "the hod sparse mock catalog consists of @xmath20 voids with @xmath9 @xmath21 effective minimum radii ( @xmath22 @xmath21 ) and this void catalog represents a relatively low resolution galaxy sample with density @xmath23 particles per cubic @xmath21 matching the number density and clustering of the sdss dr@xmath24 galaxy sample @xcite using the parameters found by @xcite ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 chosen to fit the mean number density ) .",
    "in addition to this another mock galaxy catalog is used here ; n - body mock catalog which is a single hod mock galaxy catalog in real space at @xmath31 , generated by a dark matter simulation of @xmath32 particles ( with a particle mass resolution @xmath33 @xmath34 in a @xmath35 gpc / h box and is tuned to sdss dr@xmath24 in full cubic volume by using the hod parameters found in @xcite and it consists of @xmath36 voids @xcite . although the n - body mock catalog is processed slightly differently than hod sparse and hod dense , it is a hod mock catalog and it uses planck first- year cosmological parameters @xcite .    in the following section , we examine the above data sets from a statistical perspective such as histograms , parameters of location ( range , mean , median ) , mode or dispersion ( standard deviation ) and shape ( skewness , kurtosis ) by following the previous study of @xcite . from a statistical perspective , we also investigate the connection between the distribution and the environment of void populations .",
    "as a first step , the raw data plots of void size distributions are obtained for dm full , dm dense , dm sparse , haloes dense and haloes sparse .",
    "note that the void size distributions for hod dense , hod sparse and n - body mock data sets are discussed in great detail in @xcite . in the raw void",
    "size distributions , an unexpected local peak is observed around the value @xmath37 mpc / h in the dm full sample and in the dm dense sample around @xmath38 mpc / h , see fig 1 upper left and lower left panels . a similar behavior is observed by @xcite in the n - body mock sample around the value @xmath39 mpc / h .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "here , extending our previous study of @xcite to attempt to find a universal void size distribution , we investigate the statistical properties of the void size distribution such as the shape parameters and their relations to the void environment of cvc by using the moment method by following @xcite . as aforementioned ,",
    "the moment method is easy to apply .",
    "therefore , we here confirm our previous result on the size distributions of voids which states that the @xmath0-parameter log - normal distribution gives a satisfactory model of the size distribution of voids , which is obtained from simulation and mock catalogs of cvc ; n - body mock , dm full , dm dense , dm sparse , haloes dense , haloes sparse , hod sparse and hod dense ( see fig 6 , also fig 3 in @xcite ) .    on the other hand , we should keep in mind that all the data sets of cvc are generated by a single n - body simulation that operates counting scales as nlogn .",
    "therefore the nature of these data sets may enforce us to obtain such a unique void size distribution . at this point being critical",
    "is essential before stating that there is a universal void size distribution satisfying the @xmath0-parameter log - normal . as a result , a thorough investigation of the void size distribution by using other voids catalogs to unveil the truth beyond the relation between the shape of the void size distribution and the void environment has a key importance .",
    "especially , taking into account that @xcite point out some problems and inconsistencies in cvc such as the identification of some overdense regions as voids in the galaxy data of the sdss dr@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "processing from the problems of the cvc , @xcite provide an alternative public catalogue of voids , obtained from using an improved version of the same watershed transform algorithm .",
    "therefore , it is essential to extend our analysis of void size distributions to the catalog given by @xcite .",
    "again , this is particularly important to confirm whether the @xmath0-parameter log - normal void size distribution is valid in a different void catalog .",
    "if the 3-parameter log - normal distribution fits another simulated / mock void catalogues , then this may indicate that voids have universal ( redshift independent ) size distributions given by the log - normal probability function .",
    "apart from this , @xcite show that void average density profile can be represented by an empirical function in @xmath2cdm n - body simulations by using zobov .",
    "this function is universal across void size and redshift . following this , @xcite investigate the density profiles of voids which are identified by again using the zobov in mock luminous red galaxy catalogues from the jubilee simulation , and in void catalogues constructed from the sdss lrg and main galaxy samples . as a result ,",
    "@xcite show that the scaled density profiles of real voids show a universal behavior over a wide range of galaxy luminosities , number densities and redshifts .",
    "processing from these results , there is a possibility that the @xmath0-parameter log - normal void size distribution may be a universal distribution for voids in simulated as well as real data samples .",
    "that is why , it is critical to extend our analysis to other simulated as well as real data sets",
    ".    we also observe that the number of nonzero and zero void central densities in the samples have important effects on the shape of the @xmath0-parameter log - normal void size distributions . as is seen in table 1 and fig 1 ,",
    "if the percentage of number of nonzero central densities reaches @xmath40 in a simulated or mock sample in cvc , then a second population emerges in the void size distribution .",
    "this second population presents itself as a second peak in the log - normal size distribution , at larger radius .    also , we here obtain a linear relation between the maximum tree depth and the skewness of the samples , and this relation is given by equation [ eqn : mtd - skew ] ( see fig 3 ) .",
    "this linear relation indicates that if there is a void in a simulated / mock sample with a high maximum tree depth , then we expect more skewed log - normal distribution .",
    "therefore , there is a direct correlation between the void substructure and the skewness of the void size distribution .",
    "the possibility of this relation is mentioned by @xcite .",
    "therefore , we here confirm that the skewness of a void size distribution is a good indicator of void substructures in a simulated / mock sample .",
    "aforementioned , the minimum radius cut of cvc samples defined by two density - based criterion as given by @xcite can affect the relation skewness - mtd .",
    "the minimum radius cut of cvc is particularly important because it may not only affect the resulting skewness of the data sets but also other shape parameters of the void size distributions , which can violate the confirmation of the log - normal distribution of the samples .",
    "that is why , it is important to study raw samples to understand the effect of the minimum radius - cut .",
    "in addition to skewness - mtd linear relation , another linear correlation is obtained between the maximum tree depth and the variance of the sparse samples of cvc ( see equation [ eqn : mtd - variance - sparse ] ) . as is seen from fig 4 ,",
    "sparse samples with high maximum tree depth tend to be more dispersed than a sparse sample with lower maximum tree depth . on the other hand , although we obtain a linear relation between the maximum tree depth and the variance of the dense samples ( see equation [ eqn : mtd - variance - dense ] ) , due to the lack of dense samples with merging tree depth , this relation does not provide enough information to define a relation between these parameters ( see fig 4 , red dotted line ) .",
    "but it is obvious that the relation between maximum tree depth and variance shows two different behaviors for the sparse and the dense samples .",
    "this is an expected result since variance is the indicator of dispersion by definition .",
    "while sparse samples are highly dispersed with high variance values , the dense samples are expected to show lower variance / dispersion than the sparse samples .",
    "these relations indicate that there is a direct correlation between the shape parameters of the void size distribution such as skewness , variance and the void substructures .",
    "our next goal is to address the following questions : is it possible to relate the shape parameters of the void size distribution to the environment in real data samples ? do the shape parameters change in time , indicating the dynamical evolution of the void size distribution ?",
    "is the @xmath0-parameter log - normal void size distribution universal ?",
    "the authors would like to thank paul sutter and his team for constructing and sharing the cosmic void catalog .",
