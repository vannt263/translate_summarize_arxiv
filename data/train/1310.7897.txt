    "all students of quantum field theory are taught that the propagator of a scalar field has a kllen - lehmann representation @xmath0 with a non - negative spectral function @xmath1 . above a certain threshhold , @xmath2 is positive , which seems to be required by the interpretation of @xmath2 as a sum of absolute squares .",
    "things may be different when spin enters , but for the important case of qed it appears that the photon propagator has a non - negative @xmath2 .",
    "this happens because the photon propagator is gauge - invariant and @xmath2 has contributions only from physical and positive cross - sections .",
    "yet this is a red herring , since positivity comes about only at the cost of a fatal flaw in qed : the ultraviolet landau pole , at which the running charge becomes infinite and its square becomes negative for higher momenta .",
    "turn now to asymptotically - free ( af ) non - abelian gauge theories ( nagts ) such as qcd , which are consistent theories of spin - one gluons because they have no uv landau pole .",
    "( in perturbation theory they have landau poles in the infrared that have to be cured by some form of mass generation ; we take this for granted . ) but the properties of the spectral function are not obvious . unlike the photon propagator , the usual gluon self - energy as defined by feynman diagrams depends on the gauge chosen , and can have negative contributions to the spectral function . and finally , to the extent that the gluon is not capable of existing as a free physical particle , one might question the very existence of a gluon propagator , let alone its meaning .",
    "extracting the spectral function from lattice data is much more than an academic exercise ; it is an important step toward constructing the minkowski - space propagator , with its information on the nature of the ( now well - established ) gluon mass and other physical features .",
    "but that extraction is by no means straightforward , as we will see , and its physical interpretation is obscure to the extent that the propagator is simulated in a non - physical gauge . ideally , one would simulate the gauge - invariant pinch technique@xcite ( pt ) propagator , which means to simulate it , either directly or indirectly , in the background field method ( bfm ) feynman gauge@xcite , convert@xcite it to the pt - rgi propagator that is both gauge invariant and renormalization - group invariant ( rgi ) by a simple multiplication by the coupling @xmath3 , and extract the resulting pt - rgi spectral function .",
    "this program is in its very earliest stages , and in this review we concentrate mostly on what needs to be done to extract important properties of the spectral function .",
    "as we review in sec .",
    "[ latt ] , there is no doubt that the spectral function of an af propagator in a covariant gauge such as landau gauge has a spectral function with non - positive contributions .    in one way",
    "it is not surprising that an af gluon propagator violates positivity in a covariant gauge , because as conventionally described ( by feynman diagrams in perturbation theory ) such a gauge for the propagator leads to states with negative norms .",
    "but perhaps one should be surprised , because the same is true for the photon propagator in qed , yet we have no reason to believe that the qed spectral function has any negative parts .",
    "this suggests that somehow af makes the difference .",
    "several authors made this point , beginning long ago@xcite and continuing to more recent times@xcite .",
    "some authors@xcite study the landau - gauge propagator ; another@xcite considers the gauge- and renormalization - group - invariant ( rgi ) propagator @xmath4 of the pinch technique@xcite ( pt ) .",
    "we call this the pt - rgi propagator@xcite , and discuss it briefly in sec .",
    "[ ptsec ] . from the pt - rgi point of view",
    "the lack of positivity has a natural and physical interpretation for an af theory@xcite , essentially coming from the logarithmic vanishing of the running charge .",
    "although the landau - gauge propagator is not in itself a physical object and has no such interpretation , oehme and zimmermann s results are important for comparison with the landau - gauge propagator that is measured on the lattice .",
    "on the other hand , any pt - rgi function should contain physical information , and the pt - rgi propagator certainly does .",
    "but it is not like qed , where the positive spectral function can be , in principle , reconstructed from physical cross - sections .    even though there are presently no techniques for directly simulating the pt - rgi gluon propagator on the lattice , it may be possible@xcite to retrieve this from landau - gauge simulations as discussed in sec .",
    "[ non - pos ] .",
    "we now switch to a euclidean representation , with metric @xmath5 .",
    "one can show@xcite from general principles such as the renormalization group and af that the landau - gauge gluon propagator has a non - positive spectral function .",
    "write this propagator as : @xmath6 with @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we do not explicitly call out the perturbative zero - mass pole , corresponding to a contribution @xmath9 .",

    "one sees already that trouble lies ahead for a physical interpretation , since @xmath15 depends on the gauge ( of course , @xmath16 does not ) . in the landau gauge , and with no matter fields , one finds a positive value : @xmath17 the landau - gauge propagator therefore vanishes faster than @xmath18 near infinity , which manifestly contradicts the representation ( [ spect ] ) if @xmath2 is positive .",
    "clearly , from ( [ spect ] ) if @xmath19 vanishes faster than @xmath18 at infinity , a superconvergence relation @xmath20 holds and there must be some region where @xmath2 changes sign .",
    "we take the usual convention that the tree - level propagator is @xmath21 meaning that @xmath2 must be negative for asymptotically - large @xmath22 .",
    "given the asymptotic behavior of the gluon propagator : @xmath23 the spectral function behaves like : @xmath24    this conclusion puzzles oehme and zimmermann , who expect a positive @xmath2 and therefor a _ negative _ value for @xmath25 .",
    "this is the situation of qed , but this negative value comes with a uv landau pole where the running charge blows up .",
    "these authors argue that for qcd perhaps the landau gauge is not representative of the true physics , since the other possibility for changing the sign while retaining af is that the number of quark flavors lies between 10 and 16 .",
    "another possibility might be that an integral representation such as ( [ spect ] ) does not hold , even with a non - positive spectral function , and that the propagator is an entire function .",
    "but the authors go on to show that the gluon propagator can not be an entire function , except at an infrared - stable fixed point ( which ordinary qcd does not have ) , and must have a cut extending to infinity .",

    "lattice simulations are always done for euclidean ( spacelike , in minkowski terms ) momenta , which means that some vital information about the gluon propagator is not available directly , but must be inferred from necessarily approximate considerations .",

    "<S> both lattice simulations and theoretical studies show that the spectral function of the gluon propagator of qcd ( in various gauges , as well as for the gauge - invariant pinch technique , or pt , propagator ) is not non - negative everywhere , although it should be if it has a physical interpretation as in qed . </S>",
    "<S> theory says moreover that the non - positive spectral function of the landau - gauge or of the pt gluon propagator is further constrained to obey a superconvergence relation ( the integral of the spectral function vanishes ) . </S>",
    "<S> we review the theoretical and lattice evidence for violation of positivity as well as various interpretations of this violation , and consider methods for checking superconvergence on the lattice ( so far undone ) . </S>",
    "<S> the most common interpretation is that positivity violation implies confinement of gluons , so the gluon propagator does not describe processes with physical gluons . </S>",
    "<S> another more direct and gauge - invariant interpretation arises from the pt : asymptotic freedom alone demands non - positivity and superconvergence . </S>"
