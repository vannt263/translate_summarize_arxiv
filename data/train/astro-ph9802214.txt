    "it has long been speculated on the fundamental role that the angular momentum could play in determining the fate of collapsing proto - structures and several models have been proposed to correlate the galaxy type with the angular momentum per unit mass of the structure itself ( faber 1982 ; kashlinsky 1982 ; fall 1983 ) .",
    "some authors ( see barrow & silk 1981 ; szalay & silk 1983 and peebles 1990 ) have proposed that non - radial motions would be expected within a developing proto - cluster due to the tidal interaction of the irregular mass distribution around them , typical of hierarchical clustering models , with the neighbouring proto - clusters .",
    "the kinetic energy of these non - radial motions prevents the collapse of the proto - cluster , enabling the same to reach statistical equilibrium before the final collapse ( the so - called previrialization conjecture by davis & peebles 1977 , peebles 1990 ) .",
    "this effect may prevent the increase in the slope of the mass autocorrelation function at separations given by @xmath2 , expected in the scaling solution for the rise in @xmath3 but not observed in the galaxy two - point correlation function .",
    "the role of non - radial motions has been pointed by several authors ( see davis & peebles 1983 : gorski 1988 ; groth et al .",
    "1989 ; mo et al . 1993 ; van de weygaert & babul 1994 ; marzke et al .",
    "1995 and antonuccio - delogu & colafrancesco 1995 ) .",
    "antonuccio - delogu & colafrancesco derived the conditional probability distribution @xmath4 of the peculiar velocity around a peak of a gaussian density field and used the moments of the velocity distribution to study the velocity dispersion around the peak .",
    "they showed that regions of the proto - clusters at radii , @xmath5 , greater than the filtering length , @xmath6 , contain predominantly non - radial motions .",
    "+ non - radial motions change the energetics of the collapse model by introducing another potential energy term .",
    "in other words one expects that non - radial motions change the characteristics of the collapse and in particular the _ turn around _ epoch , @xmath7 , and consequently the critical threshold , @xmath8 , for collapse . here , we want to remind that @xmath9 is the time at which the linear density fluctuations , that generate the cosmic structures , detach from the hubble flow .",
    "the turn - around epoch is given by : @xmath10^{1/2 } ( 1+z)^{3/2}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the mean background density , @xmath12 is the redshift and @xmath13 is the mean over - density within the non - linear region .",
    "after the _ turn around _ epoch , the fluctuations start to recollapse .",
    "as known for a spherical top hat model , the perturbation of the density field is completely collapsed when @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the time of collapse which is twice the turn around epoch .",
    "one expects that non - radial motions produce firstly a change in the turn around epoch , secondly a new functional form for @xmath8 , thirdly a change in the mass function calculable with the press - schechter ( 1974 ) formula and finally a modification of the two - point correlation function . as we shall show in a forthcoming paper ( del popolo & gambera 1997b ) non - radial motions",
    "can reduce several discrepancies between the scdm model and observations : the strong clustering of rich clusters of galaxies ( @xmath16 ) far in excess of cdm predictions ( bahcall & soneira 1983 ) , the x - ray temperature distribution function of clusters over - producing the observed cluster abundances ( bartlett & silk 1993 ) .",
    "+ for the sake of completeness , we remember that alternative models with more large - scale power than scdm have been introduced in order to solve the latter problem . several authors ( peebles 1984 ; efstathiou et al . 1990 ; turner 1991 ; white et al .",
    "1993 ) have lowered the matter density under the critical value ( @xmath17 ) and have added a cosmological constant in order to retain a flat universe ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the spectrum of the matter density is specified by the transfer function , but its shape is affected because of the fact that the epoch of matter - radiation equality is earlier , @xmath19 being increased by a factor @xmath20 . around the epoch",
    "@xmath21 the growth of the density contrast slows down and ceases after @xmath21 . as a consequence the normalisation of the transfer function begins to fall , even if its shape is retained .",
    "+ mixed dark matter models ( mdm ) ( bond et al .",
    "1980 ; shafi & stecker 1984 ; valdarnini & bonometto 1985 ; holtzman 1989 ; schaefer 1991 ; schaefer & shafi 1993 ; holtzman & primack 1993 ) increase the large - scale power because free - streaming neutrinos damp the power on small scales . alternatively changing the primeval spectrum several problems of scdm",
    "are solved ( cen et al . 1992 ) . finally , it is possible to assume that the threshold for galaxy formation is not spatially invariant but weakly modulated ( @xmath22 on scales @xmath23 ) by large scale density fluctuations , with the result that the clustering on large - scale is significantly increased ( bower et al .",
    "+ moreover , this study of the role of non - radial motions in the collapse of density perturbations can help us to give a deeper insight in to the so - called problem of biasing . as pointed out by davis et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , unbiased cdm presents several problems : pairwise velocity dispersion larger than the observed one , galaxy correlation function steeper than that observed ( see liddle & lyth 1993 and strauss & willick 1995 ) .",
    "the remedy to these problems is the concept of biasing ( kaiser 1984 ) , i.e. that galaxies are more strongly clustered than the mass distribution from which they originated .",
    "the physical origin of such biasing is not yet clear even if several mechanisms have been proposed ( rees 1985 ; dekel & silk 1986 ; dekel & rees 1987 ; carlberg 1991 ; cen & ostriker 1992 ; bower et al . 1993 ; silk & wyse 1993 ) .",
    "recently colafrancesco , antonuccio - delogu & del popolo ( 1995 , hereafter cad ) and del popolo & gambera ( 1997a ) have shown that dynamical friction delays the collapse of low-@xmath24 peaks inducing a bias of dynamical nature . because of the dynamical friction , under - dense regions in clusters ( the clusters outskirts ) accrete less mass than that accreted in absence of this dissipative effect and as a consequence over - dense regions are biased toward higher mass ( antonuccio - delogu & colafrancesco 1994 and del popolo & gambera , 1996 ) .",
    "non - radial motions acts in a similar way to dynamical friction : they delay the shell collapse consequently inducing a dynamical bias similar to that produced by dynamical friction",
    ". this dynamical bias can be evaluated defining a selection function similar to that given in cad and using bardeen , bond , szalay & kaiser ( 1986 , hereafter bbks ) prescriptions .",
    "+ the methods used in this paper are fundamentally some results of the statistics of gaussian random fields , the biased galaxy formation theory and the spherical model for the collapse of density perturbations . in particular , we calculate the specific angular momentum acquired by protoclusters and the time of collapse of protoclusters using the gaussian random fields theory and the spherical collapse model following ryden s ( 1988a , hereafter r88a ) approach .",
    "the selection function that we introduce is general and obtained by the only hypothesis of gaussian density field .",
    "the approach and the final result is totally different from bbks selection function and similar to that of colafrancesco , antonuccio & del popolo ( 1995 ) .",
    "only the biasing parameter is obtained from a bbks approximated formula .",
    "this choice will be clarified in the following sections of the paper .",
    "+ the plan of the paper is the following : in sect .",
    "2 we obtain the total specific angular momentum acquired during expansion by a proto - cluster . in sect .",
    "3 we use the calculated specific angular momentum to obtain the time of collapse of shells of matter around peaks of density having @xmath25 and we compare the results with gunn & gott s ( 1972 , hereafter gg ) spherical collapse model . in sect .",
    "4 we derive a selection function for the peaks giving rise to proto - structures while in sect .",
    "5 we calculate some values for the bias parameter , using the selection function derived , on three relevant filtering scales . finally in sect .",
    "6 we discuss the results obtained .",
    "the explanation of galaxies spins gain through tidal torques was pioneered by hoyle ( 1949 ) in the context of a collapsing protogalaxy .",
    "peebles ( 1969 ) considered the process in the context of an expanding world model showing that the angular momentum gained by the matter in a random comoving _ eulerian _",
    "sphere grows at the second order in proportion to @xmath26 ( in a einstein - de sitter universe ) , since the proto - galaxy was still a small perturbation , while in the non - linear stage the growth rate of an oblate homogeneous spheroid decreases with time as @xmath27 .",
    "+ more recent analytic computations ( white 1984 ; hoffman 1986 and r88a ) and numerical simulations ( barnes & efstathiou 1987 ) have re - investigated the role of tidal torques in originating galaxies angular momentum .",
    "in particular white ( 1984 ) considered an analysis by doroshkevich ( 1970 ) that showing as the angular momentum of galaxies grows to first order in proportion to @xmath28 and that peebles s result is a consequence of the spherical symmetry imposed to the model .",
    "white showed that the angular momentum of a lagrangian sphere does not grow either in the first or in the second order while the angular momentum of a non - spherical volume grows to the first order in agreement with doroshkevich s result .",
    "+ hoffman ( 1986 ) has been much more involved in the analysis of the correlation of the growth of angular momentum with the density perturbation @xmath29 .",
    "he found an angular momentum - density anticorrelation : high density peaks acquire less angular momentum than low density peaks .",
    "one way to study the variation of angular momentum with radius in a galaxy is that followed by r88a . in this approach",
    "the protogalaxy is divided into a series of mass shells and the torque on each mass shell is computed separately .",

    "this is the angular momentum - density anticorrelation showed by hoffman ( 1986 ) .",
    "this effect arises because the angular momentum is proportional to the gain at turn around time , @xmath7 , which in turn is proportional to @xmath65 .",
    "one of the consequences of the angular momentum acquisition by a mass shell of a proto - cluster is the delay of the collapse of the proto - structure . as shown by barrow & silk ( 1981 ) and szalay & silk ( 1983 ) the gravitational interaction of the irregular mass distribution of proto - cluster with the neighbouring proto - structures gives rise to non - radial motions , within the protocluster , which are expected to slow the rate of growth of the density contrast and to delay or suppress the collapse . according to davis & peebles ( 1977 ) the kinetic energy of the resulting non - radial motions at the epoch of maximum expansion increases so much to oppose the recollapse of the proto - structure .",
    "numerical n - body simulations by villumsen & davis ( 1986 ) showed a tendency to reproduce this so - called previrialization effect . in a more recent paper by peebles ( 1990 ) the slowdown in the growth of density fluctuations and the collapse suppression after the epoch of the maximum expansion were re - obtained using a numerical action method .",
    "+ in the central regions of a density peak ( @xmath66 ) the velocity dispersion attains nearly the same value ( antonuccio - delogu & colafrancesco 1995 ) while at larger radii ( @xmath67 ) the radial component is lower than the tangential component .",
    "this means that motions in the outer regions are predominantly non - radial and in these regions the fate of the infalling material could be influenced by the amount of tangential velocity relative to the radial one .",
    "this can be shown writing the equation of motion of a spherically symmetric mass distribution with density @xmath68 ( peebles 1993 ) : @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are , respectively , the mean radial and tangential streaming velocity .",

    "one way of defining the bias coefficient of a class of objects is that given by ( bbks ) : @xmath168 where @xmath169 is : @xmath170   t\\left(\\frac{\\nu}{\\nu_{t}}\\right ) n_{pk}(\\nu ) d\\nu   \\label{eq : nu}\\ ] ] we want to remember that , as shown by coles ( 1993 ) , the biasing parameter can be also estimated by means of the ratio of the amplitudes of the correlation function , @xmath171 , and the matter auto - covariance function , @xmath172 : @xmath173 or by means of the ratio of the cumulative integral of the two - points correlation function ( @xmath174 ) and that of the auto - covariance function ( @xmath175 ) : @xmath176 or finally the ratio of galaxy , @xmath177 , to mass , @xmath178 , power spectra : @xmath179 as stressed by coles ( 1993 ) a local bias generally produces a different response in each of these descriptors .",
    "even the qualitative behaviour of the limit of large scales can be different , i.e. @xmath180 can increase or decrease .",
    "so one should decide very carefully which one of these definitions must be used , when discussing the behaviour of the biasing parameter . being conscious of these difficulties we have chosen one of the most popular descriptor of the biasing parameter ( see also lilje 1990 , liddle & lith 1993 , croft & efstathiou 1994 , cad ) in order to make comparisons with other models . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : nu ] ) it is clear that the bias parameter can be calculated once a spectrum , @xmath181 , is fixed .",
    "the bias parameter depends on the shape and normalization of the power spectrum .",
    "a larger value is obtained for spectra with more power on large scale ( kauffmann et al .",
    "1996 ) . in this calculation",
    "we continue to use the standard cdm spectrum ( @xmath182 , @xmath183 ) normalized imposing that the rms density fluctuations in a sphere of radius @xmath184 is the same as that observed in galaxy counts , i.e. @xmath185 . the calculations have been performed for three different values of the filtering radius ( @xmath186 @xmath187 , @xmath188 @xmath151 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath189 , that we have obtained , are respectively , in increasing order @xmath190 , 1.6 , 1.93 and 2.25 . +",
    "as shown , the value of the bias parameter tends to increase with @xmath111 due the filter effect of @xmath153 . as shown @xmath155 acts as a filter , increasing the filtering radius , @xmath152 , the value of @xmath24 at which @xmath154 increases . in other words when @xmath6 increases",
    ", @xmath155 selects density peaks of a larger height .",
    "the reason for this behavior must be searched in the smoothing effect that the increasing of the filtering radius produces on density peaks .",
    "when @xmath6 increases the density field smooths and @xmath153 has to shift towards a higher value of @xmath191 in order to select a class of object of fixed mass @xmath192 .",
    "in this paper we have studied the role of non - radial motions on the collapse of density peaks solving numerically the equations of motion of a shell of barionic matter falling into the central regions of a cluster of galaxies . we have shown that non - radial motions produce a delay in the collapse of density peaks having a low value of @xmath191 while the collapse of density peaks having @xmath148 is not influenced .",
    "a first consequence of this effect is a reduction of the mass bound to collapsed perturbations and an increase in the critical threshold , @xmath8 , which now is larger than that of the top - hat spherical model and depends on @xmath191 .",
    "this means that shells of matter of low density have to be subject to a larger gravitational potential , with respect to the homogeneous gg s model , in order to collapse .",
    "+ the delay in the proto - structures collapse gives rise to a dynamical bias similar to that described in cad whose bias parameter may be obtained once a proper selection function is defined .",
    "the selection function found is not a pure heaviside function and is different from that used by bbks to study the statistical properties of clusters of galaxies .",
    "its shape depends on the effect of non - radial motions through its dependence on @xmath139 .",
    "the function @xmath155 selects higher and higher density peaks with increasing value of @xmath6 due to the smoothing effect of the density field produced by the filtering procedure . using this selection function and bbks prescriptions",
    "we have calculated the coefficient of bias @xmath193 .",
    "+ on clusters scales for @xmath194 we found a value of @xmath195 comparable with that obtained from the mean mass - to - light ratio of clusters , apm survey , or from n - body simulations combined with hydrodynamical models ( frenk et al .",
    "morever , the value of the coefficient of biasing @xmath189 that we have calculated is comparable with the values of @xmath189 given by kauffmann et al .",
    "this means that non - radial motions play a significant role in determining the bias level . in our next paper (",
    "del popolo & gambera , in preparation ) we make a more detailed analysis on the problem of the bias .",
