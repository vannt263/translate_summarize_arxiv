    "[ sec : intro ] galactic circumnuclear environments , in which stars and the ism are present in a dense state , are of vast astrophysical interest .",
    "the circumnuclear ism , generally thought to be composed of externally acquired material and local stellar ejecta , is the neccesary fuel for the smbh to become an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) . theoretically , how the fuel is transported to the smbh is not fully understood ( see a recent review by wada 2004 ) .",
    "observationally , direct links between nuclear activities and the properties of the ism remain to be uncovered .",
    "timescales of both dynamical and thermal processes are relatively short in circumnuclear regions .",
    "thus a passive accumulation of the multi - phase ( e.g. , neutral and ionized ) ism there would inevitably lead to an interaction among its various components , and possibly to an enhanced nuclear and/or star - forming activity ( e.g. , ho , filippenko & sargent 1997 ; sarzi et al .",
    "2007 ) . that different phases of the ism often co - exist in galactic circumnuclear regions , some showing organized morphologies ( e.g. , van dokkum & franx 1995 ; macchetto et al .  1996 ; knapen et al .  2005 ) , suggests that there are certain mechanisms regulating the dynamics and energetics of the ism , which remain to be understood .",
    "furthermore , the global evolution of the ism , one of the fundamental issues on galaxy evolution , can not be fully assessed without understanding its role in circumnuclear regions .",
    "owing to its proximity ( @xmath7780 kpc ; 1@xmath8 = 0.23 kpc ) , the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) provides an ideal testbed for studing a galactic circumnuclear environment .",
    "indeed , the inner few hundred parsecs of m31 have received vast observational attention , from radio to x - ray , tracing all phases of the ism and various types of stars in the region . as we will further discuss in later sections ,",
    "it is clear that the smbh of m31 ( i.e. , m31@xmath0 ) is currently inactive and thus brings minimal disturbance to its environment , in which there is also little indication for recent star formation . without the confusion from such activities , this environment offers a unique `` quiescent '' close - up of possible relationships among the various interstellar and stellar components as well as the nucleus . in this work we aim to probe and to understand such relationships .    studying the ism against a high stellar radiation background is by no means straightforward at any wavelength .",
    "in particular , it is practically difficult to isolate the x - ray emission of truly diffuse hot gas from the collective emission of individually unresolved stars . in a recent study of the m31 bulge with _",
    "chandra _ observations ( li & wang 2007 ; hereafter lw07 ) , we have managed to account for the collective x - ray emissivity of faint , unresovled stars ( see also revnivtsev et al .  2007 ;",
    "bogdn & gilfanov 2008 ) according to the near - infrared ( nir ) k - band light distribution , and thus revealed the presence of diffuse hot gas on kpc - scales ( lw07 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : dif]a ) .",
    "this procedure in turn allows us to advance the high - resolution study of hot gas in the circumnuclear regions .",
    "the rich observational knowledge in the literature on m31@xmath0 and its surrounding matter ( except for the hot gas yet to be studied ) deserves a selected summary in   [ sec : obs ] , which in turn serves as a necessary guide for subsequent analyses and discussions .",
    "the preparation of multiwavelength data used in this work is brifely described in   [ sec : data ] .",

    "we assume that the x - ray source n1 is indeed embedded in p1 . by fixing the angular displacement between n1 and the yet unresolved m31@xmath0 as that between the two optical nuclei , i.e. , 05 ( lauer et al .",
    "1998 , fig .  8 therein ) , we perform a 2-d fit to the acis image by adopting a model consisting of three delta functions convolved with the local psf , respectively respresenting sss , n1 and m31@xmath0 , and a constant representing the background `` diffuse '' emission .",
    "the local psf is mimicked by stacking seven bright sources detected within the central 30@xmath40 .",

    "we find no statistically significant variation over a factor of 2 from observation to observation as well as from within the 38 ks acis - s observation .",
    "our constraint for the x - ray emission of m31@xmath0 relies on the assumption that the bright x - ray source n1 is embedded in p1 instead of being an interloper . in galactic bulges the most likely interlopers are low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) .",

    "accordingly , the expected number of lmxbs along this line is @xmath370.05 . hence the probability that we have detected n1 as an interloper is small .",
    "moreover , stellar mass bhs and neutron stars ( ns ) formed in the central cusp of the bulge are predicted to sink into the close vicinity ( few parsecs ) of the smbh , due to dynamical friction on less massive background stars ( morris 1993 ) .",
    "such migrators thus have a chance to compete with the smbh on the consumption of surrounding gas to become bright x - ray sources .",
    "nayakshin & sunyaev ( 2007 ) modeled such a process and found that the collective x - ray luminosity of the migrated compact objects can be higher than that of the smbh by up to two orders of magnitude , dependent on the mass of the common accretion disk .",
    "this scenario lends further support to the above procedure of pinning n1 on the position of p1 , in a sense that n1 is the appearance of one or a few accreting stellar mass bhs , being about ten times brighter than m31@xmath0 . in regard of the common origin of p1 and p2 ( i.e. , an eccentric stellar disk ) , it is possible that the x - ray signals detected from the position of p2 , which we have considered as originated from m31@xmath0 , also arise from stellar mass bhs .",
    "the marginal flux variation detected does not offer much help in distinguishing between a stellar mass bh origin and a smbh origin .",
    "it is worth to note that , at the position of p1 , which is the apocenter of the eccentric orbits , bhs ( and stars ) have small velocities and hence a greater chance to capture the surrounding gas at large accretion rates .",
    "the situation is likely opposite at the position of p2 . in conclusion ,",

    "assuming an sn heating efficiency @xmath1921 and that the stellar mass loss is wholly involved , an average energy input of @xmath33.6 kev per gas particle is inferred .",
    "the gravitational potential of a normal galaxy is unlikely to confine the gas with such a high temperature .",
    "therefore the gas is expected to escape , at least from inner regions of the host galaxy .",
    "indeed , for many early - type galaxies the observed x - ray luminosity of hot gas , @xmath185 , is typically no more than a few percent of the expected energy input rate from sne ia ( e.g. , david et al .",
    "2006 ; li , wang & hameed 2007 ; lw07 ) ; the inferred gas mass is also much less than expected if the stellar ejecta has been accumulating for a substantial fraction of the host galaxy s lifetime .",
    "such discrepancies can be explained naturally with the presence of an outflow of hot gas , in which the `` missing '' energy and mass are transported outside the regions covered by the observations .",
    "it can be shown that the stellar feedback is also largely missing in the core of m31 .",
    "for the central arcmin we have @xmath193 and @xmath194 , whereas the sn heating rate is @xmath3@xmath195 and the mass input rate is @xmath3@xmath196 ( taking only @xmath3@xmath197 to accumulate the observed amount of hot gas ) . clearly , these suggest an outflow launched in the circumnuclear regions , as already hinted at by the x - ray morphology (   [ subsec : hotgas ] ) . on the other hand , the fitted gas temperature in the m31 core ,",
    "@xmath30.3 kev (   [ subsec : hotgas ] ) , is much lower than the maximum allowed temperature of @xmath33.6 kev ( @xmath198 ) , that @xmath199@xmath31 is often implicitly assumed in the context of early - type galaxies , in which individual sne occur in volume - filling hot gas .",
    "the sn blast wave does not dissipate easily and can effectively convert mechanical energy into thermal energy ( i.e. , @xmath199@xmath31 ; tang & wang 2005 ) . in the case of m31 ,",
    "dissipation of the blast wave could become important when it encounters the cold , dense gas of the nuclear spiral .",
    "the amount of energy loss in such a process , via mechanical and radiational dissipations , depends on the geometry of the encounter and the local gas density ( e.g. , mckee & cowie 1975 ) , but is unlikely large enough to result in @xmath200 , as the solid angle covered by the nuclear spiral with respect to the wave front must be less than 2@xmath108 .",
    "alternatively , a reduced gas temperature is expected given a mass input in addition to the stellar deposition .",
    "in particular , this is conceivable via thermal evaporation of the nuclear spiral .",
    "such evaporation at an appropriate rate would result in a `` mass - loading '' of the hot gas , a process we shall now consider .",
    "we assume that the nuclear spiral is composed of discrete cloudlets .",
    "the geometry of these cloudlets , which determines the evaporation rate , is rather uncertain . as a first order approximation we consider spherical cloudlets having a characteristic radius @xmath201 .",
    "only those cloudlets that are smaller than a critical radius , @xmath202 25 pc , would be evaporating ; condensation would be more likely to take place for larger ones upon radiative cooling ( mckee & cowie 1977 ) .",
    "while the large co clump may be an example of this latter case , most cloudlets in the region , essentially unresolved under the few - arcsec resolution , appear to be small enough to undergo evaporation . in regions",
    "where the h@xmath30 and mir emission are associated , the cold neutral gas most likely resides in the cores of the cloudlets with evaporating , ionized outer layers ; in regions where only the h@xmath30 emission is prominent , the cloudlets are likely in the late stages of evaporation and nearly fully ionized .",
    "the number of cold cloudlets , @xmath203 , satisfies @xmath204 , or @xmath205 .",
    "similarly , for the warm cloudlets we have @xmath206 , or @xmath207 . if @xmath208 , the size of the warm cloudlets is about half that of the cold cloudlets , consistent with a reduced size due to early evaporation .",
    "the classical thermal conductivity ( spitzer 1962 ) holds when the mean free path of conducting electrons , @xmath209 , is shorter than the scale - length of temperature variation , roughly being the cloudlet radius . adopting @xmath210 and assuming that classical evaporation applies , the total evaporation rate of the cold cloudlets is @xmath211 ( cowie & mckee 1977 ) , implying a corresponding mass input rate about five times that of the stellar ejecta to the @xmath212 230 pc region .",
    "an additional evaporation of @xmath30.01@xmath213 may arise from the fully ionized cloudlets . for cloudlets of smaller initial sizes ,",
    "the conduction becomes saturated and the evaporation rate from individual cloudlets drops significantly ( cowie & mckee 1977 ) , but the correspondingly number of cloudlets must increase to conserve the total gas mass and hence could result in a comparable @xmath214 .",
    "several self - consistency checks are needed before concluding the likelihood of the above scenario .",
    "first , the evaporation timescale is @xmath215 , not much longer than the time needed for the cold gas to spiral an angle of 2@xmath108 , @xmath216 .",
    "thus the gas is likely to have evaporated before spiraling into the very central regions .",
    "this naturally explains the observed x - ray enhancement coincident with the inner arm as well as the lack of cold gas observed in the @xmath212 50 pc regions (   [ subsec : multi ] ; fig .",
    "[ fig : multi ] ) .",
    "second , although difficult to measure , a gas inflow rate of @xmath3@xmath217 from the outer disk regions of m31 is entirely possible",
    ". typical gas inflow rates of @xmath218-@xmath219 are suggested for barred spirals ( e.g. , quillen et al .",
    "1995 ; sakamoto et al .",
    "1999 ) , which often lead to an observed concentration of @xmath220-@xmath221 neutral gas in the central kpc .",
    "in contrast , the gas mass in the central kpc of m31 is merely @xmath3@xmath222 . without consumption of gas by star formation",
    ", this lack of gas concentration is most likely due to the evaporation process discussed above . in this regard ,",
    "the maximum evaporation rate afforded by a hot corona in barred spirals is likely @xmath3@xmath223 .",
    "third , the implied mass - loading rate to the corona results in a reduced heating per gas particle that is about right for the measured temperature of the hot gas .",
    "the mass - loading also predicts a dilution of metallicity for the hot gas .",
    "in particular , the iron abundance is expected to be @xmath224 due to sn ia enrichment ( nomoto , thielemann & yokoi 1984 ) of the collective stellar ejecta alone .",
    "the measured @xmath225 solar ( table [ tab : spec ] ) , is consistent with the predicted dilution .",
    "it is not immediately clear , however , how a supersolar abundance of mg and a subsolar abundance of o are simultaneously derived from the mass - loading .",
    "one possibility is that the mg abundance reflects the primary type ii sne enrichment at the outer disk regions before gas inflowing to the nuclear spiral .",
    "the o abundance , on the other hand , might have been underestimated , in a sense that the resonance scattering of the o vii and o viii k@xmath30 line emission is not properly accounted for in the spectral fit , since these lines are optically thick if the velocity dispersion of the hot gas is not far from its thermal broadening .",
    "[ subsec : uv ]    the detection of the  absorption lines (   [ subsec : ovi ] ) provides direct evidence for the presence of interstellar gas with temperatures of a few @xmath39 k associated with m31 .",
    "the next question to address is the origin of this gas . in view of the discussed scenario above , gas with intermediate temperatures ( between @xmath226 k )",
    "is naturally expected to exist in the evaporating layers of the nuclear spiral , which may be enhanced by turbulent mixing ( slavin , shull , & begelman 1993 ) induced by the sne ia shock waves . for individual classically evaporating cloudlet ,",
    "the absorption column is ( mckee & cowie 1977 ) , @xmath227r_s d(t / t_h ) \\approx 5.2\\times10^{18 } n_h x_{\\rm o^{5+}}[n_{\\rm o}/n_{\\rm h}]r_{\\rm pc } { \\rm~cm^{-2}},\\ ] ] where @xmath228 is the ionization fraction of @xmath229 ions . in collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) ,",
    "@xmath228 peaks at @xmath30.24 at a temperature of @xmath3@xmath230 k ( mazzotta et al .",
    "1998 ) , whereas in the evaporating layers where the ionization structures are determined by the gas dynamics and typically of non - equilibrium ( nie ) , @xmath228 can be as high as @xmath30.6 ( b@xmath231hringer & hartquist 1987 ) .",
    "taking the nie value of @xmath228 , a solar oxygen abundance @xmath232 \\approx 6.8\\times10^{-4}$ ] ( grevesse & sauval 1998 ) , and our fiducial values of @xmath150 and @xmath233 (   [ subsec : role ] ) , we have @xmath234 .",
    "therefore , a circumnuclear origin for the observed column of @xmath235 requires on average multiple conductive interfaces along the sight - line , which does not seem warranted given the small volume filling factor ( @xmath236@xmath3@xmath237 ) of the cloudlets .",
    "moreover , while the conductive interfaces are likely to absorb the bulge starlight from the far - side ( i.e. , behind the nuclear spiral ) to some extent , the starlight from the near - side bulge likely compensates the absorption to the extent that no prominent  absorption lines would be detected , if -absorbing gas only exists in the circumnuclear regions .",
    "the fact that a column density as high as @xmath235 is observed thus implies a subtantial fraction of the -absorbing gas distributed in and around the near - side bulge .    in a two - dimensional spectroscopic study covering approximately the same field of view as the _ fuse _ observations , del burgo et al .",
    "( 2000 ) identified several features of ionized gas , which they desigated as clouds a - f , via h@xmath238 , [ o iii ] , h@xmath30 and [ n ii ] emission lines . at resolutions of 05 - 27 ( @xmath32 - 10 pc )",
    ", these clouds are found to have typical diameters of @xmath32 pc and @xmath17510 pc .",
    "the small ones exhibit a narrow velocity range and are likely truly isolated with a size consistent with that of our fiducial cloudlets , whereas the larger ones tend to have an elongated shape and exhibit velocity gradients and thus are likely composed of multiple cloudlets .",
    "the cloud velocities ( corrected for the systemic velocity of @xmath100310 @xmath239 ) range from @xmath240 to 234 @xmath239 , with a mean value of @xmath241 and a typical velocity dispersion of 60 @xmath239 .",
    "thus the -absorbing gas responsible for the observed lines with a centroid velocity of @xmath340 @xmath239 , blueshifted with respect to the systemic velocity of m31 (   [ subsec : ovi ] ) , appears to be dynamically distinct from the circumnuclear ionzied gas .",
    "this supports the above argument that a subtantial fraction of the observed  column density arises from the near - side bulge .",
    "moreover , the blueshifted velocity of the -absorbing gas implies that it is also not dynamically coupled with the global outflow of hot gas .",
    "a probable origin of the -absorbing gas is the ejecta of bulge stars ( e.g. , red giant winds , planetary nebulae ) being heated by the ambient hot gas ( parriott & bregman 2008 ) .",
    "a quantitative accounting of the observed quantities demands a proper modelling of the stellar sed , the distribution and evolution of the stellar ejecta and radiation transfer along the sightline , and is beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "alternatively , the observed  column density may mostly arise from in front of the bulge , i.e. , the highly inclined thick disk of m31 . if the amount of -absorbing gas in the m31 disk is similar to that of our galaxy , we would then expect an amount of @xmath242 , where 12.5 deg accounts for the inclination of the disk and @xmath243 is the average vertical column density observed in the galaxy ( savage et al .",
    "of course , the  column varies by a factor of 2 between the two sides of the galactic disk , and the amount of -absorbing gas is probably less in m31 than in the galaxy , as the latter is substantially more active in star formation . nevertheless , within the uncertainties , the bulk of the observed  column density can be attributed to the highly inclined thick disk of m31 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : multi]d we have noted the fuv enhancement apparently associated with the nuclear spiral .",
    "it is possible that this enhancement arises from the evaporating gas with a temperature of few @xmath39 k. this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : uv ] , in which cie volume emissivities of the _ galex _ fuv and nuv bands are shown as a function of gas temperature .",

    "k , gas exhibits its peak fuv emissivity and an fuv / nuv ratio of @xmath35 .",
    "ideally , one wants to isolate and quantify the fuv emission intrinsic to the evaporating gas , but this is hampered by the large uncertainties in the stellar sed and dust extinction .",
    "we derive a not quite tight constraint for the  absorption column density , @xmath244@xmath245 , associated with the evaporating gas , from the total fuv flux of @xmath3@xmath246 observed within the central 15@xmath34 .",
    "[ subsec : ionize ] with the above findings and scenarios in mind , we now revisit the ionizing source of the nuclear spiral in m31 , a long - standing puzzle ( devereux et al .",
    "1994 ) . assuming a [ n ii]/h@xmath30 intensity ratio of 2 and that every recombination produces 0.45 h@xmath30 photons , the observed h@xmath30+[n ii ] flux of @xmath247 within the central arcmin implies a recombination rate @xmath248 . in the absence of massive young stars , possible sources for the ionizing photons include : i ) uv radiation of old stars ; ii ) x - ray photons from the hot gas as well as stellar objects ; iii ) uv photons induced by thermal conduction ; iv ) uv photons induced by shocks ; and v ) cosmic - rays produced by the nucleus or sn events .",
    "below we assess the relative importance of these sources .",
    "extended recombination line emission , particularly h@xmath30 emission , is often observed in elliptical galaxies .",
    "binette et al .",
    "( 1994 ) demonstrated that the ionizing photons from post - agb stars with effective temperatures of @xmath310@xmath249 k are typically sufficient to account for the observed h@xmath30 emission .",
    "the h@xmath30 intensity is found to be correlated with the optical luminosity within regions of the line emission ( macchetto et al .",
    "1996 ) , further suggesting a stellar origin of the ionizing photons in elliptical galaxies .",
    "according to binette et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , post - agb stars provide ionizing photons ( i.e. , shortward of 912@xmath250 ) at a rate of @xmath251 . in the central arcmin of m31 , this gives a recombination rate of @xmath252 , where @xmath253 is a geometric factor that determines the fraction of ionizing photons received by the nuclear spiral .",
    "it is also possible that the ionizing photons are related to the so - called _ uv - upturn _ , a rise in the sed shortward of @xmath32500@xmath250 observed in elliptical galaxies as well as the m31 core ( burstein et al .  1988 ) . in view of the lack of young stars ,",
    "the uv - upturn is generally attributed to the emission of hot horizontal branch ( hb ) stars ( e.g. , brown et al .  1998 ) , with an effective temperature of a few @xmath254 k. such stars could also be partially responsible for the recombination line emission observed in m31 . according to the latest model for the uv - upturn ( han et al .  2007 ; han 2008 , private communication ) ,",
    "hb stars produce ionizing photons at a rate of @xmath255 , corresponding to a recombination rate of @xmath256 in the central arcmin of m31 .",
    "ionization could also be induced by x - rays via secondary ionization by photoelectrons . assuming that on average each incident x - ray photon from the hot gas produces a 0.3 kev primary photoelectron , the number of secondary ionizations is @xmath310 ( shull 1979 ) .",
    "the recombination rate induced by x - ray photons is then @xmath257 , according to the photon luminosity of @xmath3@xmath258 within the central arcmin .",
    "while stellar objects dominate the overall x - ray luminosity of m31 , there are only 33 sources detected within the central arcmin ( voss & gilfanov 2007 ) , the corresponding covering factor @xmath259 of which must be small compared to that of the volume - filling hot gas .",
    "hence the x - ray ionization by stellar objects is negligible .",
    "the thermal conduction proposed above is accompanied by ionizations .",
    "ionizing photons are generated at a rate of @xmath260 ( mckee & cowie 1977 ) , where @xmath261 is the effective area of the conduction front and other symbols are defined above . with @xmath262 , @xmath263 .",
    "shocks are likely present in the nuclear spiral either due to orbital dissipation ( e.g. , englmaier & shlosman 2000 ) or the propagation of sn blast wave into the cold gas .",
    "such shocks produce ionizing photons at a rate of @xmath264 ( shull & mckee 1979 ) , where @xmath265 is the shock velocity , @xmath266 a tabulated numerical factor and @xmath267 the rather uncentain effective area of the shock front . adopting @xmath268 and @xmath269 , we have @xmath270 .    finally , ionizations can be induced by cosmic - rays .",
    "we adopt an ionization rate per hydrogen atom of @xmath271 for 2 mev protons ( goldsmith , habing & field 1969 ) , with an energy density of @xmath272 inferred from the central regions of m31 (   [ sec : obs ] ) . with a hydrogen mass of @xmath273 , the recombination rate",
    "is inferred to be @xmath274 , given a filling factor @xmath275 .    from the above estimates ,",
    "it is evident that the only likely ionizing source for the nuclear spiral is the stellar uv radiation predominantly contributed by the post - agb stars , with an additional contribution from hb stars .",
    "the other sources all fall short of accounting for the required ionizing photons .",
    "the stellar radiation being the ionizing source is consistent with the observed limb - brightened h@xmath30 emission of the filaments on the sides facing the m31 center (   [ subsec : multi ] ) , where the radiation intensity presumably peaks .",
    "however , it has been a concern that models for the photoionization due to post - agb stars predict an [ n ii]@xmath56584/h@xmath30 intensity ratio of @xmath31.2 for gas with an abundance up to 3 solar ( binette et al .",
    "1994 ) , which is inconsistent with the high ratios ( generally @xmath1751.3 , as large as @xmath32.7 ) observed in m31 ( ciardullo et al .",
    "the relatively high [ n ii]/h@xmath30 ratio implies that heating in addition to photoionization contributes substantially to the production of the nitrogen ions .",
    "for instance , a temperature of @xmath3@xmath276 k is needed for gas in cie to produce a [ n ii]/h@xmath30 ratio of 2 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : uv ] ) , while at temperatures below @xmath277 k the ratio is essentially below 1 .",
    "if a substantial fraction of the observed [ n ii ] line emission indeed arises from gas heated to @xmath3@xmath278 k , the total [ n ii ] luminosity of @xmath3@xmath279 then implies a heating rate on the order of @xmath280 , as the [ n ii ] lines typically account for only few percent of the total radiative cooling ( fig .",
    "[ fig : uv ] ) . the energy input from sne ia , while responsible for the heating of the hot gas , alone may not be sufficient to account for this radiative loss . in this",

    "<S> chandra_/acis data , we tightly constrain the x - ray luminosity of m31@xmath0 , the central supermassive black hole ( smbh ) of the galaxy , to be @xmath1 , approximately one part per 10@xmath2 of the eddington luminosity . from the diffuse x - ray emission , we characterize the circumnuclear hot gas with a temperature of @xmath30.3 kev and a density of @xmath3@xmath4 . in the absence of an active smbh and recent star formation , </S>",
    "<S> the most likely heating source for the hot gas is type ia supernovae ( sne ) . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of cooler , dusty gas residing in a nuclear spiral has long been known in terms of optical line emission and extinction . </S>",
    "<S> we further reveal the infrared emission of the nuclear spiral and evaluate the relative importance of various possible ionizing sources . </S>",
    "<S> we show evidence for interaction between the nuclear spiral and the hot gas , probably via thermal evaporation . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism lends natural understandings to 1 ) the inactivity of m31@xmath0 , in spite of a probably continuous supply of gas from outer disk regions and 2 ) the launch of a bulge outflow of hot gas , primarily mass - loaded from the circumnuclear regions . </S>",
    "<S> one particular prediction of such a scenario is the presence of gas with intermediate temperatures arising from the conductive interfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the _ fuse _ observations do show strong @xmath51032 and @xmath51038 absorption lines against the bulge starlight , but the effective column density , @xmath6 , may be attributed to foreground gas located in the bulge and/or the highly inclined disk of m31 , leaving the amount of circumnuclear gas with intermediate temperatures largely uncertain . </S>",
    "<S> our study strongly argues that stellar feedback , particularly in the form of energy release from sne ia , may play an important role in regulating the evolution of smbhs and the interstellar medium ( ism ) in galactic bulges . </S>"
