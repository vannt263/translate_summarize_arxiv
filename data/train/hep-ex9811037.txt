    "the mean lifetime of the @xmath0 lepton is deduced from geometrical reconstruction of @xmath0 daughter tracks in @xmath3 events .",
    "we need to know the @xmath0 lifetime in order to make certain tests of lepton universality .",
    "such tests are sensitive to the @xmath4 coupling and also to possible new physics  @xcite ; at present the precision is limited by the experimental uncertainties on the @xmath0 lifetime and branching fractions .",
    "the @xmath0 lifetime is also useful for evaluating the strong coupling constant @xmath5  @xcite .    in this talk",
    "i use the conventional coordinate system for @xmath1 experiments , i.e. , with the @xmath6 ( polar ) axis along the direction of the incident beams .",
    "the impact parameter @xmath7 of a reconstructed charged track is measured in the @xmath8 projection with respect to the nominal interaction point ; @xmath7 is signed according to the @xmath6 component of the track s angular momentum about this point .",
    "the azimuthal decay angle @xmath9 of a @xmath0 daughter track is defined as the signed quantity @xmath10 in the laboratory frame , where @xmath9 lies between @xmath11 and @xmath12 .    at present , useful measurements of the @xmath0 lifetime",
    "can be obtained by sld , the four lep experiments , and cleo , and the experimental conditions are quite different in these places .",
    "as far as the lifetime measurement is concerned , the relevant differences include the @xmath0 flight distance in the laboratory ( which varies as @xmath13 of the @xmath0 boost ) , the opening angles of the @xmath0 decay products ( which vary roughly as @xmath14 ) , the dimensions of the luminous region , and the number of collected @xmath0 pairs .",
    "on the other hand , the impact parameters of the @xmath0 daughters are on the order of @xmath15 in all experiments , as long as the @xmath0 has @xmath16 .",
    "comparisons of the experimental conditions are given in table  [ t : cond ] and fig .",

    "in this section i give a brief description of the @xmath0 lifetime measurement methods that are currently in use .      the decay length ( dl ) method ( or vertex method )",
    "is applied to three - prong @xmath0 decays  @xcite .",
    "the procedure consists of reconstructing the @xmath0 decay vertex in two or three dimensions . in order to evaluate the @xmath0 decay length ,",
    "an estimate of the @xmath0 production point is also needed . in an @xmath3 event ,",
    "the only available estimate is the centroid of the luminous region .",
    "because the luminous region is huge along the direction of the beam axis ( considerably larger than the typical @xmath0 flight distance ) , we can effectively estimate only two of the three coordinates of the @xmath0 production point , and we end up with a measurement of the @xmath0 displacement @xmath17 in the @xmath8 projection .",
    "an estimate of the polar angle @xmath18 of the @xmath0 direction , taken for example from the event thrust axis , is therefore needed in order to calculate the @xmath0 flight distance @xmath19 in three dimensions .",
    "the mean lifetime is deduced from the mean of the @xmath19 distribution and the mean value of @xmath13 ; the latter is calculated from simulated @xmath20 events , including initial and final state radiation , after the event selection criteria are applied .",

    ", the possibility of measuring the @xmath6 coordinate of the @xmath0 decay vertex is not particularly useful for the classical dl method .",
    "however , it is important to realize that the tracking information from the @xmath28 view can also significantly improve the measurement of the @xmath29 coordinates of the decay vertex , from which the lifetime is extracted .",
    "this point is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f : rzview ] .    at lep and sld ,",
    "the size of the luminous region and the tracking resolution are such that the statistical uncertainty on the mean decay length is dominated by the natural width of the exponential @xmath30 distribution ; the relative uncertainty on the mean lifetime is not far from its optimum value , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the number of selected @xmath0 decays .",
    "the systematic errors in dl analyses at high energies also tend to be fairly small . in short , our detectors and our technique for measuring",
    "the @xmath0 lifetime from three - prong decays at lep and sld are very effective .    at lower center - of - mass energies",
    "the @xmath0 decay length is shorter and the size of the luminous region can significantly dilute the precision of the measurement . in such cases",
    "the decay length resolution can be improved by considering the separation of the two decay vertices in  topology events .",
    "this procedure eliminates the smearing due to the size of the luminous region , but it does not dramatically improve the final results because the statistics are low and the @xmath33 background is larger in the  channel .",
    "while the dl method is entirely satisfactory for analyzing three - prong @xmath0 decays , we can not apply such a straightforward technique to the one - prong decays . due to the unobserved neutrinos",
    ", the @xmath0 direction is unknown . we can not reconstruct the decay length of an individual @xmath0 decaying into one prong .",
    "we can nevertheless measure the mean decay length from a collection of one - prong decays .",
    "the relative statistical uncertainty will be considerably larger than @xmath34 .",
    "we will do best if we analyze both @xmath0 decays in an event together .",
    "it is difficult to incorporate all of the event information into a simple method .",
    "we now use several methods to analyze one - prong decays .",
    "each method uses a different subset of the available information , and none of the methods is vastly superior to the others .",
    "we combine the results from the various methods , taking into account the statistical and systematic correlations , to utilize as much of the available information as possible .",
    "i now proceed to describe these methods in more detail .",
    "the impact parameter ( ip ) method is applied to one - prong @xmath0 decays  @xcite . in this method ,",
    "an estimate of the @xmath0 direction is taken , for example , from the event thrust axis .",
    "the lifetime - signed impact parameter of the daughter track is then defined : @xmath35 the mean of the @xmath36 distribution is then roughly proportional to @xmath37 .",
    "the dependence of the @xmath36 distribution on @xmath37 is determined from monte carlo simulation",
    ".    decays with @xmath38 result from the impact parameter resolution , the size of the luminous region , and errors on the @xmath0 direction .",
    "the last of these effects is probably the most dangerous because it brings about a substantial change in the mean of @xmath36 , and we rely on the monte carlo to correctly describe the @xmath0 direction errors .",
    "although we tend to think of the ip method as a one-@xmath0-at - a - time method , the @xmath0 in the opposite hemisphere contributes to the thrust axis determination and hence affects the @xmath36 distribution .",
    "the impact parameter difference ( ipd ) method is applied to  topology events  @xcite . in this method",
    "the mean @xmath0 decay length is extracted by considering the correlation between the difference on the daughter track impact parameters @xmath7 and the difference of their azimuthal angles @xmath39 .",
    "specifically , we define @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the acoplanarity of the two daughter tracks .",
    "if the @xmath43 and @xmath44 are back to back in the @xmath8 projection and the decay angles @xmath9 are small , such that @xmath45 , we find , at a particular value of @xmath46 , that @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the mean @xmath0 decay length in the lab .",
    "a fit to the @xmath49  vs @xmath46 distribution is performed to extract the slope @xmath48 .",
    "the polar angle @xmath18 is taken from the event thrust axis ; the resulting error on the @xmath0 direction has a negligible effect on the fitted @xmath48 .",
    "the main disadvantage of the ipd method is that the uncertainty on the @xmath20 production point due to the size of the luminous region enters twice in the smearing on @xmath49 .",
    "the miss distance ( md )  @xcite and momentum - dependent impact parameter sum ( mips )  @xcite methods are designed to give improved statistical precision by virtually eliminating the smearing effects related to the size of the luminous region . in a  topology event we define the `` miss distance '' @xmath50 .",
    "this sum of impact parameters is , roughly speaking , the distance in the @xmath8 projection between the two daughter tracks at their closest approach to the beam axis .",
    "this quantity is almost independent of the @xmath20 production point .",
    "the @xmath51 distribution depends on @xmath37 ; a monte carlo simulation is used to parametrize the true distribution , in order to extract the lifetime from the data .",
    "the main disadvantage of these methods is that the results of the fit to the data are sensitive to the assumed impact parameter resolution .",
    "i refer to the simplest form of this analysis as the md method .",
    "the mips method is a refinement of md in which the @xmath51 distribution is parametrized in terms of the momenta in the lab of the two @xmath0 daughter tracks .",
    "delphi s new results announced at this workshop feature the mips refinement and one other : the @xmath51 distribution is parametrized separately for lepton and hadron daughters ; i refer to this method as md++ .",
    "the three - dimensional impact parameter ( 3dip ) method makes use of more of the kinematic information in the events to yield a higher sensitivity per event than the other one - prong methods  @xcite .",
    "the main disadvantage is that the method can only be applied to _",
    "hadron _ vs _ hadron _",
    "events ( 42% of all @xmath20 events ) . because a @xmath52 decay yields only one unobserved neutrino , it is possible to reconstruct the @xmath0 direction in _ hadron _ vs _ hadron _ events up to a twofold ambiguity .",
    "let @xmath53 and @xmath54 denote the two possible @xmath44 directions reconstructed for a particular event ( fig .",
    "[ f : threedip ] ) .",
    "if we then project the event along a direction chosen such that @xmath53 and @xmath54 coincide , we end up with no uncertainty on the @xmath0 direction in that projection .",
    "we then define a generalized impact parameter sum in that projection , so that there is almost no smearing due to the size of the luminous region .",
    "a fitting procedure operates on this impact parameter sum and on the two projected @xmath0 decays angles in order to extract the mean lifetime .",
    "the 3dip method is the first to use impact parameter information from the @xmath28 view in the analysis of one - prong decays .",
    "the method has the extremely important advantage that the tracking resolution and the @xmath0 lifetime can be extracted simultaneously from the @xmath20 events .",
    "there are four new developments to report :    * at tau98 , l3 is reporting preliminary results from their 199495 data , analyzed with the dl and ip methods  @xcite .",

    "the thesis of patrick saull ( argus )  @xcite describes the vertex impact parameter ( vip ) method , which provides improved lifetime sensitivity for  topology events in cases where the size of the luminous region limits the precision of the dl method .",
    "the vip method uses the impact parameter of the one - prong track with respect to the three - prong vertex , and the acoplanarity of the one- and three - prong jets .",
    "( a similar approach is described in  @xcite . ) * in 1997 , aleph published results from the 3dip method ( 199294 data )  @xcite and from the mips , ipd , and dl methods ( 1994 data )  @xcite , preliminary versions of which had been shown at tau96 .",
    "in calculating the world average @xmath0 lifetime , i follow the particle data group  @xcite and ignore early measurements with large uncertainties .",

    "most recent measurements of the @xmath0 lifetime are statistics limited . nevertheless , it is useful to examine the systematic effects that we will need to deal with in the coming years in order to further improve the precision of the measurements",
    ". some of the important sources of systematic errors are tracking errors ( simulation and/or parametrization ) ; vertex fit and lifetime extraction procedures ; and detector alignment .",
    "i will now discuss each of these topics in turn .",
    "i would like to mention two delicate issues related to tracking errors .",
    "the first issue concerns the dependence , in some methods , of the measured lifetime on the assumed impact parameter resolution .",
    "in such cases , it is mandatory to measure the resolution from reconstructed tracks in the real data .",
    "bhabha and dimuon events are readily available for this job , but the high momentum electrons and muons in those samples are not representative of the @xmath0 daughter tracks and the contribution to the impact parameter resolution from multiple scattering can not be studied .",
    "some experiments employ @xmath60 , @xmath61 events to parametrize the resolution at the low end of the momentum range . while these test samples can give a fairly precise description of the impact parameter resolution for electrons and muons , it is not easy to use the real data to parametrize the effects of nuclear interactions on pion and kaon tracks .",
    "the second issue concerns the correlation between the errors on the reconstructed impact parameter and direction of a track , e.g. , between @xmath7 and @xmath39 .",
    "this correlation is positive and results from the extrapolation of the reconstructed tracks from the measured points in the tracking detectors to the interaction region . in some methods",
    "the correlation can simulate a longer @xmath0 lifetime  @xcite .",
    "the effect is especially bad for the @xmath0 ( compared to other particles ) because ( 1 ) the short @xmath0 lifetime leads to small impact parameters , ( 2 ) the small @xmath0 mass leads to small decay opening angles ( which get smaller at higher @xmath62 ) , and ( 3 ) we fit to the entire proper time spectrum ( as opposed to the situation in charm lifetime measurements in fixed target experiments , where a cut @xmath63 is imposed and the mean lifetime is determined from the _ slope _ of the proper time distribution ) .",
    "the effects of the tracking errors on the measured @xmath37 must be carefully taken into account .",
    "although the direct reconstruction of @xmath0 decay lengths in the dl method appears to be quite straightforward , several subtle effects are present , yielding biases on the measured lifetime .",
    "these effects are related to the tracking resolution , and they can be substantial in experiments where the vertex resolution along the @xmath0 direction is larger than the mean decay length ( not the case at sld and lep ) .    *",
    "due to the correlation between the track impact parameter and direction errors , fluctuations to larger opening angles in a three - prong decay tend to be associated with upward fluctuations in the reconstructed decay length .",
    "the larger opening angles also lead to a smaller calculated uncertainty on @xmath19 .",
    "thus the upward fluctuations in @xmath19 are associated with larger weights in the calculation of the mean decay length .",
    "* radiative events have lower @xmath0 momenta , which tend to result in smaller decay lengths .",
    "but the lower momenta also tend to yield larger opening angles of the daughter tracks and therefore smaller uncertainties on @xmath19 .",
    "thus smaller decay lengths are associated with larger weights . * in some vertex fitting programs , the covariance matrices describing the errors on the reconstructed track parameters are `` swum '' to the location of the fitted vertex and a second fitting iteration is performed .",
    "this appears to be a reasonable thing to do , but such a fitting program assigns larger weights , on average , to the @xmath0 s with larger decay lengths , leading to a bias on the average decay length .",
    "tracking systems are calibrated and surveyed based on tracks reconstructed in the data .",
    "this procedure is not perfect ; after alignment , the average impact parameter @xmath64 ( which would ideally be zero ) can vary with @xmath65 and @xmath39 by @xmath66 or more .",
    "the @xmath0 lifetime measurement is , however , based on impact parameters on the order of @xmath15",
    ". how can the experiments claim systematic uncertainties related to detector alignment as small as @xmath67 ?",
    "a conjecture , put forth by aleph  @xcite , provides some insight .",
    "they theorize that the effects of @xmath7 offsets cancel , to first order , if there are no azimuthal holes in the acceptance of the tracking system .",
    "to illustrate this point , i present the preliminary results of a simple monte carlo study .",
    "simulated @xmath3 events at @xmath68 were generated , and a sample of @xmath69 three - prong decays was selected with reasonable cuts on the momentum and polar angle of the daughter tracks .",
    "rather sterile conditions were maintained for the experiment : gaussian tracking errors were generated , with @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .",
    "a two - dimensional vertex fit was performed for each decay , and no errors on the @xmath0 production point or the @xmath0 direction were introduced in the calculation of the decay length .",
    "impact parameter offsets were then applied as a function of @xmath39 , and the fits were repeated , to study the effect on the decay length bias @xmath73 .",
    "i tried four different @xmath7 offset configurations , as described below .",
    "* no @xmath7 offsets . when no systematic offsets are applied to the impact parameters , the average bias is @xmath74 , reflecting the small positive bias due to the correlation of the @xmath7 and @xmath39 errors .",
    "the rule of thumb is that the relative decay length bias is roughly equal to the ratio of the detector - induced correlation of @xmath7 and @xmath9 to the lifetime - induced correlation . in this case",
    "the detector - induced correlation is @xmath75 , while the lifetime - induced correlation is roughly @xmath76 , so the ratio is @xmath77 , which is comparable ( ! ) to the observed offset . *",
    "uniform offset plus one excursion .",
    "the `` input '' plot in fig .",
    "[ f : offsetb ] shows the applied @xmath7 offset of @xmath78 everywhere , plus a triangular excursion of amplitude @xmath79 in one region .",
    "the `` output '' plot shows that the local bias @xmath80 is essentially the derivative of the input function with respect to @xmath39 , with the sharp edges smoothed out over an angular scale corresponding to the typical opening angle of the @xmath0 decays . in particular , the slope of the offset function in the region of the excursion is @xmath81 ( converting the degrees to radians ) .",
    "this quantity is equal to @xmath82 of the mean decay length in the @xmath8 projection , whereas the maximum observed bias in the output plot is about @xmath83 . in spite of the large local biases , the global average bias is @xmath84 , i.e.",
    ", unchanged from experiment  a. if the acceptance is unbroken in @xmath39 , and the bias is the derivative of the input function , then the average bias is proportional to the integral of the derivative , which is zero for _ any _ input offset function . *",
    "radial shift of silicon vertex detector faces . here",
    "i consider a one - layer vertex detector with nine flat faces at a radius of @xmath85 .",
    "i suppose that the silicon wafers are shifted away from the origin by @xmath86 with respect to their assumed locations .",
    "i then make the crude approximation that this shift has no effect on the reconstructed track directions and simply introduces an offset on @xmath7 given by @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the azimuthal angle of incidence of the track on the wafer .",
    "this scenario corresponds to the input function shown in fig .",
    "[ f : offsetc ] .",
    "again the output plot looks like the derivative of the input : the local bias has positive @xmath89 functions ( again smeared due to the opening angles of the @xmath0 decays ) in the regions where the daughter tracks do not all pass through the same vertex detector face and a uniform negative value elsewhere .",
    "the bias is locally as large as @xmath90 .",
    "nevertheless , the global average bias is unchanged : @xmath91 .",
    "* broken azimuthal acceptance .",
    "this experiment is the same as experiment  c , except that @xmath92 azimuthal gaps are introduced between adjacent faces of the vertex detector .",
    "i reject @xmath0 decays in which one or more of the daughter tracks passes through a gap .",
    "naturally , this has no effect on the output plot ( fig .",
    "[ f : offsetd ] ) except near the positive spikes ; some of the events that had a large positive bias in experiment  c are now removed from the sample . the resulting negative bias on the global mean decay length is huge : @xmath93 .",
    "if the gaps had been wider , such that the three daughter tracks in selected events always pass through the same face of the vertex detector , the bias on the mean @xmath8 decay length would have been simply @xmath94 ( the radial shift of the faces ) or @xmath95 .",
    "these experiments show that @xmath7 offsets due to alignment and calibration errors in tracking systems have little effect on the measured lifetime in the dl method , as long as the azimuthal acceptance is unbroken .",
    "in fact it is straightforward to prove that the same result holds for the ipd method .",
    "but these conclusions rely on the assumption that the weighting of the events in the lifetime averaging procedure is independent of @xmath39 . in a realistic situation where the smearing related to the luminous region is significant ( not at sld ! ) and",
    "depends on @xmath39 , the ( reweighted ) integral of the derivative of the offset function is , in general , not equal to zero .",
    "it should be mentioned that correlated offsets in @xmath7 and @xmath39 can yield a bias even when the azimuthal acceptance is unbroken .",
    "it is straightforward to measure the @xmath7 offsets versus @xmath65 and @xmath39 from bhabha , dimuon , or @xmath33 events .",
    "corrections may then be applied to the @xmath0 data . on the other hand ,",
    "offsets in @xmath39 are difficult to measure ; the systematic uncertainty on the lifetime should allow for a range of possibilities .",
    "systematic offsets in impact parameter and direction may also be present in the @xmath28 view .",
    "these offsets , affecting methods such as dl and 3dip , which do not operate solely in the @xmath8 projection , are difficult to measure .",
    "moreover , there is no bias cancellation rule for such offsets because the unbroken acceptance and periodic boundary conditions do not apply in @xmath65 as they do in @xmath39 .    finally , it is interesting to note that the absolute scale of the lifetime measurements is set by the impact parameter scale , which depends on the detector dimensions . in experiments with microstrip or pixel vertex detectors ,",
    "it is the pitch of those detector elements that counts , not the radii of the vertex detector layers .",
    "with some methods , the @xmath0 lifetime measurement must be `` calibrated '' by means of monte carlo events .",
    "for example , the interpretation of the impact parameter sum distributions studied in the md / mips methods is based on simulated events . in other methods ( e.g. , dl and ipd ) there is a simple geometric relation between the observables and the mean lifetime , so , to first order , no calibration is needed . in such cases",
    "the monte carlo is normally used to check for `` possible '' biases in a measurement ; a sample of events with known generated lifetime is passed through the analysis , and the reconstructed mean lifetime is compared to the input value . the experimenters may then choose one of two valid approaches :    1 .",
    "if @xmath96 is significantly different from @xmath97 , apply the difference as a correction to the lifetime measured in the data .",
    "2 .   always apply the difference as a correction to the lifetime measured in the data .",
    "approach  1 is used by most experiments .",
    "it turns out that between 1985 and 1993 the difference @xmath98 was not subtracted in eight published measurements of @xmath37 with the dl method . in all eight cases , @xmath96 was greater than @xmath97  @xcite .",
    "this observation is experimental evidence that common biases are present in all dl measurements .",
    "corrections must be applied for all biases before a valid world average can be calculated .",
    "i would encourage experimenters to apply those corrections themselves , but to go far beyond approach  2 .",
    "we can and should identify and measure each _ individual _ source of bias in our analyses by means of monte carlo events . here is an example from the ipd method . the bias that results from radiative events in which the @xmath43 and @xmath44 are _ not _ back to back in the @xmath8 projection can be evaluated by calculating @xmath99 ( see section  [ ss : ipd ] ) from monte carlo truth information , with and without a correction for the acoplanarity of the @xmath0 s , and comparing the fitted lifetimes in the two cases .",
    "such a technique yields a measurement of this one bias with very good statistical precision , and the reliability of the simulation can be checked by searching for @xmath100 events in data and monte carlo .",
    "a series of measurements of this type can be devised , using various pieces of information from the monte carlo truth , in order to evaluate each contribution to @xmath98 .",
    "we can rigorously evaluate the systematic uncertainty on the lifetime measurement only by understanding the magnitude of each bias contribution .",
    "the world average @xmath0 lifetime values evaluated by the particle data group since 1986 are plotted in fig .  [",
    "f : history ] . a fairly steady decline",
    "is observed in these averages . in my opinion ,",
    "three factors contribute to this decline : statistics , unsubtracted biases , and `` other effects . '' as evidence for the presence of `` other effects , '' the @xmath0 lifetime average in the 1992 review of particle properties  @xcite had @xmath101 for 10 degrees of freedom , corresponding to a confidence level of @xmath102 .",
    "here are a few ideas about a possible ultimate method for analyzing  topology events",
    ". we may be able to squeeze a little more out of the   ( and perhaps ) topology events if we created a method that takes into account all of the available information : energies and directions of charged and neutral particles , charged particle identification , impact parameters in @xmath27 and @xmath28 views , and the position and size of the luminous region .",
    "the method should transform this information into two or three variables from which the lifetime is extracted .",
    "it should take into account the known @xmath0 decay dynamics and allow for initial and final state radiation .",
    "furthermore , i believe we will not be able to make substantial advances in precision unless the new method allows the impact parameter resolution to be fitted from the @xmath0 data itself , as in the 3dip method .",
    "in conclusion , the world average @xmath0 lepton lifetime is @xmath103 and the @xmath59 of the average looks healthier .",
    "the lep experiments dominate the world average",
    ".    it will be a challenge to achieve the next factor of 8 improvement in precision on @xmath37 .",
    "we will need to rely on the large statistics of cleo and the b factories , with considerable care to understand and reduce systematic errors related to the fitting procedures , tracking resolution , and backgrounds .",
