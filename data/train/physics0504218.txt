    "earthquake is a stick - slip frictional instability of a fault driven by steady motions of tectonic plates [ _ scholz _ , 1990;_scholz _ , 1998 ] . while earthquakes are obviously complex phenomena , certain empirical laws have been known concerning their statistical properties , _",
    "e.g. _ , the gutenberg - richter ( gr ) law for the magnitude distribution of earthquakes , or the omori law for the time evolution of the frequency of aftershocks [ _ scholz _ , 1990 ] .",
    "these laws are basically of statistical nature , becoming eminent only after analyzing large number of events .",
    "since earthquakes could be regarded as a stick - slip frictional instability of a pre - existing fault , the statistical properties of earthquakes should be governed by the physical law of rock friction [ _ scholz _ , 1990;_scholz _ , 1998 ] .",
    "one might naturally ask : how the statistical properties of earthquakes depend on the material properties characterizing earthquake faults , _ e.g. _ , the elastic properties of the crust or the frictional properties of the fault , _ etc_. answering such questions undoubtedly would give us valuable information in understanding the true nature of earthquakes . furthermore , the full knowledge of spatio - temporal correlations of earthquakes , particularly those associated with the precursory phenomena of large events , might ultimately open up a door to the statistical prediction of large events",
    ".    meanwhile , a systematic field study of the material - parameter dependence of the statistical properties of earthquakes meets serious difficulties , partly because one has to average over large number of events in obtaining the statistically reliable properties of earthquakes , but also because it is difficult to get precise knowledge of , or even to control , various material parameters characterizing real earthquake faults .    in numerical simulation study of earthquakes ,",
    "on the other hand , these difficulties often become minor ones . in the past",
    ", earthquake models of various levels of simplifications have been proposed in geophysics and statistical physics , and their statical properties have been extensively studied mainly by means of numerical computer simulations .",
    "one of the most standard one is the so - called spring - block model originally proposed by burridge and knopoff ( burridge - knopoff model ) [ _ burridge and knopoff _ , 1967 ] . in this model ,",
    "an earthquake fault is simulated by an assembly of blocks , each of which is connected via the elastic springs to the neighboring blocks and to the moving plate .",
    "all blocks are subject to the friction force , the source of the nonlinearity in the model , which eventually realizes an earthquake - like frictional instability .",
    "the model contains several parameters representing , _",
    "e.g. _ , the elastic properties of the crust and the frictional properties of faults .",
    "of course , the space discretization in the form of blocks is an approximation to the continuum crust .",
    "although the true meaning and the possible effect of the block discretization needs fuller examination , its effect is expected to be less for a long - scale behavior associated with large events . in spite of this limitation ,",
    "the spring - block model has served as a very useful reference model of earthquakes for years .",
    "carlson , langer and collaborators performed a pioneering study of the statistical properties of earthquakes [ _ carlson and langer _ , 1989a;_carlson and langer _ , 1989b;_carlson et al .",
    "_ , 1991;_carlson _ , 1991a;_carlson _ , 1991b;_carlson et al .",
    "_ , 1994 ] , based on the spring - block model .",
    "these authors paid particular attention to the magnitude distribution of earthquake events , and examined its dependence on the friction parameter characterizing the nonlinear stick - slip dynamics of the model .",
    "it was observed that , while smaller events persistently obeyed the gr law , _",
    "i.e. _ , staying critical or near - critical , larger events exhibited a significant deviation from the gr law , being off - critical or `` characteristic''[_carlson and langer _ , 1989a;_carlson and langer _ , 1989b;_carlson et al .",
    "_ , 1991;_carlson _ , 1991a;_carlson _ ,",
    "1991b;_schmittbuhl et al .",
    "_ , 1996 ] .",
    "shaw , carlson and langer studied the same model by examining the spatio - temporal patterns of seismic events preceding large events , observing that the seismic activity accelerates as the large event approaches [ _ shaw et al . _ , 1992 ] .",
    "since then , the spring - block model has been extended in several ways , _",
    "e.g. _ , taking account of the effect of the viscosity [ _ myers and langer _",
    ", 1993;_shaw _ , 1994;_de and ananthakrisna _ ,",
    "2004 ] , or modifying the form of the friction force [ _ myers and langer _",
    ", 1993;_de and ananthakrisna _ , 2004 ] .",
    "the study of statistical properties of earthquakes was promoted in early nineties , inspired by the work by p. bak and collaborators who proposed the concept of `` self - organized criticality ( soc ) '' [ _ bak et al .",
    "_ , 1987;_bak and tang _ , 1989 ] .",
    "according to this view , the earth s crust is always in the critical state which is self - generated dynamically .",
    "the soc idea gives a natural explanation of the scale - invariant power - law behaviors frequently observed in earthquakes , including the gr law and the omori law .",
    "the soc idea was developed mainly on the basis of the cellular - automaton versions of the earthquake model [ _ bak et al .",
    "_ , 1987;_bak and tang _ , 1989;_nakanishi _ , 1990;_ito and matsuzaki",
    ", 1990;_brown et al .",

    "_ , 1999;_hainzl et al .",
    "_ , 2000;_helmstetter et al . _ , 2002;_helmstetter et al . _ ,",
    "the statistical properties of these cellular - automaton models were also studied quite extensively , often interpreted within the soc framework .",
    "these models apparently reproduce several fundamental features of earthquakes such as the gr law , the omori law of aftershocks , the existence of foreshocks , _",
    "etc_. although many of these cellular - automaton models were originally introduced to mimic the spring - block model , their statistical properties are not always identical with the original spring - block model .",
    "furthermore , as compared with the spring - block model , the cellular - automaton models are much more simplified so that the model does not have enough room to represent various material properties of the earthquake fault in a physically appealing way .",
    "thus , in the cellular - automaton models , the connection to the material parameters of real earthquake faults is rather obscure .    in the present paper ,",
    "we perform further extensive investigation of spatio - temporal correlations of earthquakes based on the burridge - knopoff ( bk ) model .",
    "our main goal is to clarify how the statistical properties of earthquakes depend on the frictional and elastic properties of earthquake faults .",
    "as compared with the cellular - automaton models , the spring - block model has an advantage that the dependence on the material parameters , including the frictional and elastic properties , are more explicit .",
    "we simulate the one - dimensional ( 1d ) version of the bk model .",
    "the statistical properties of the model , particularly its spatio - temporal correlations , are studied here by extensive numerical simulations .",
    "a preliminary report of the simulation was given in [ _ mori and kawamura _",
    ", 2005 ] .",
    "as already mentioned , numerical model simulation is a quite useful tool for our purposes : first , generating huge number of events required to attain the high precision for discussing the statistical properties of earthquakes is easy to achieve in numerical simulations whereas it is often difficult to achieve in real earthquakes , especially for larger ones .",
    "second , various material parameters characterizing earthquake faults is extremely difficult to control in real faults , whereas it is easy to control in model simulations .",
    "real faults are of course not 1d .",
    "although it is desirable to study the 2d and even the 3d models , we concentrate ourselves on the 1d model here .",
    "this is because the 1d model is much easier to simulate than the higher - dimensional counterparts , which enables us to obtain better statistics necessary to get reliable information about spatiotemporal correlations of the model .",
    "most importantly , it enables us to study large enough systems and systematically examine the finite - size effect . the extension to 2d",
    "might be done in two ways : in one , the 2d model is regarded to represent the fault plane itself [ _ carlson _ , 1991b ] , while in the other the second direction of the model is taken to be orthogonal to the fault plane [ _ myers et al .",
    "_ , 1996 ] .",
    "these numerical studies so far made on such 2d bk models , mainly concerning their magnitude distribution , suggested that the basic features of the 2d bk model might not drastically be different from those of the 1d model .",
    "indeed , our preliminary study on the 2d model , of the first type mentioned above , also supports this observation .",
    "although the model studied here , _",
    "i.e. _ , the 1d bk model is not new and has been studied by previous authors , we simulate the model by more extensive simulations than the previous ones , and investigate the statistical properties of the model through various spatio - temporal correlation functions . as a result",
    ", our present simulations have revealed several new interesting features of the model which have hitherto uncovered : these include , i ) the doughnut - like quiescence occurring just before the mainshock , ii ) a significant change of the @xmath0-value observed prior to the mainshock , and iii ) complex behaviors of the recurrence time of large events including the possible twin and unilateral character of large events , _",
    "etc_.    generally , we have found that as the velocity - weakening tendency of the friction force gets weaker , the system tends to be more critical , while as the velocity - weakening tendency gets stronger , the system tends to be more off - critical with enhanced features of a characteristic earthquake .",
    "periodic feature of large events is eminent when the friction force exhibits a strong frictional instability , whereas , when the friction force exhibits a weak frictional instability , large events often occur as twin and/or unilateral events .",
    "the model turns out to exhibit several eminent precursory phenomena prior to the large event in its spatio - temporal correlations . preceding the mainshock , the frequency of smaller events",
    "is gradually enhanced , whereas , just before the mainshock , it is suppressed in a close vicinity of the epicenter of the upcoming mainshock ( the mogi doughnut ) [ _ mogi _ , 1969;_mogi _ , 1979 ] .",
    "the time scale of the onset of the doughnut - like quiescence depends on the extent of the frictional instability . under certain conditions , preceding the mainshock , the apparent @xmath0-value of the magnitude distribution increases significantly .",
    "this increase of the @xmath0-value is more eminent when the friction force exhibits a strong frictional instability .",
    "the existence of such distinct precursory phenomena may open a way to the prediction of the time and the position of the upcoming large event .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in  2",
    ", we introduce the model and explain some of the details of our numerical simulation .",
    "the results of our simulations are presented in  3 .",
    "magnitude distribution function , earthquake recurrence - time distribution and various types of spatio - temporal correlation functions of earthquake events are calculated and analyzed . in search of the possible precursory phenomena ,",
    "particular attention is paid to the time development of the spatial correlation function of earthquake events and of the magnitude distribution function prior to large events .",
    "finally , section 4 is devoted to summary and discussion of our results .",
    "the model we deal with is the one - dimensional burridge - knopoff ( bk ) model .",
    "it consists of a 1d array of @xmath1 identical blocks , which are mutually connected with the two neighboring blocks via the elastic springs of the elastic constant @xmath2 , and are also connected to the moving plate via the springs of the elastic constant @xmath3 .",
    "all blocks are subject to the friction force @xmath4 , which is the only source of nonlinearity in the model .",
    "the equation of motion for the @xmath5-th block can be written as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the time , @xmath8 is the displacement of the @xmath5-th block and @xmath9 is the loading rate representing the speed of the plate .    in order to make the equation dimensionless , we measure the time @xmath7 in units of the characteristic frequency @xmath10 and the displacement @xmath8 in units of the length @xmath11 , @xmath12 being the static friction .",
    "then , the equation of motion can be written in the dimensionless form as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the dimensionless time , @xmath15 is the dimensionless displacement of the @xmath5-th block , @xmath16 is the dimensionless stiffness parameter , @xmath17 is the dimensionless loading rate , and @xmath18 is the dimensionless friction force .    in order for the model to exhibit a dynamical instability corresponding to an earthquake , it is essential that the friction force @xmath19 possesses a frictional _ weakening _ property , _",

    "[ 1991 ] as a technical device , represents an instantaneous drop of the friction force at the onset of the slip , while the latter , @xmath26 , represents the rate of the friction force getting weaker on increasing the sliding velocity . in the present simulation , we regard @xmath25 to be small , and fix @xmath27 .",
    "we note that there have been several other proposals for the law of rock friction , _",
    "e.g. _ , the slip - weakening friction force [ _ scholz _ , 1990;_shaw _",
    ", 1995;_myers et al .",
    "_ , 1996;_scholz _ , 1998 ] or the rate- and state - dependent friction force [ _ dietrich _ , 1979;_ruina _ , 1983;_scholz _ , 1990;_scholz _ , 1998 ]",
    "we assume here the simplest version of the velocity - weakening friction force given above .",
    "we also assume the loading rate @xmath28 to be infinitesimally small , and put @xmath29 during an earthquake event , a very good approximation for real faults[_carlson et al . _ ,",
    "1991 ] . taking",
    "this limit ensures that the interval time during successive earthquake events can be measured in units of @xmath30 irrespective of particular values of @xmath28 .",
    "taking the @xmath31 limit also ensures that , during an ongoing event , no other event takes place at a distant place , independently of this ongoing event .",
    "then , the model possesses one more parameter , a dimensionless stiffness parameter @xmath32 , which describes the elastic property of the crust .",
    "we solve the equation of motion ( 2 ) by using the runge - kutta method of the fourth order .",

    "by contrast , in the case of larger @xmath32 , the finite - size effect becomes more significant .",
    "in such cases , we simulate the system as large as @xmath40 so that the results are free from finite - size effects .",

    "these features of the magnitude distribution are consistent with the earlier observation of carlson and langer [ _ carlson and langer_,1989a;_carlson and langer _ 1989b;_carlson et al . _ , 1991 ] .",
    "it means that , while smaller events exhibit self - similar critical properties , larger events tend to exhibit off - critical or characteristic properties , much more so as the velocity - weakening tendency of the friction is increased .",

    "in particular , vasconcelos showed that a single block system exhibited a `` first - order transition '' at @xmath61 from a stick - slip to a creep [ _ vasconcelos _ , 1996 ] , whereas this discontinuous transition becomes apparently continuous in many - block system [ _ vieira et al .",

    "such an enhancement of smaller events preceding the large event was observed by _",
    "shaw et al . _ , [ 1992 ] .",
    "interestingly , however , as the mainshock becomes imminent , the frequency of smaller events is _ suppressed in a close vicinity of the epicenter of the upcoming mainshock , though it continues to be enhanced in the surroundings_. for real earthquake faults , such a quiescence phenomenon has been discussed as the `` mogi doughnut '' [ _ mogi _ , 1969;_mogi _ , 1979;_scholz _ , 1990 ] .",
    "the present observation contrasts with the earlier work of carlson , who claimed that the 1d bk model did not exhibit such a doughnut - like quiescence [ _ carlson _ , 1991a ] .",
    "we note that the quiescence observed here occurs only in a close vicinity of the epicenter of the mainshock , within one or two blocks from the epicenter , and only at a time close to the mainshock .",
    "the time scale for the appearance of the doughnuts - like quiescence depends on the @xmath26 and @xmath32 values .",
    "namely , the time scale of the onset of the doughnut - like quiescence tends to be shorter for smaller @xmath26 and larger @xmath32 , as can be seen from figs.12(a)-(d ) .",
    "the doughnut - like quiescence observed here is closely related to the characteristic interval time scales associated with the single - block event , @xmath127 and @xmath128 , discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "namely , the time scale of the onset of the doughnut - like quiescence is basically determined by @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "indeed , the time scale of the onset of the doughnut - like quiescence turns out to be well described by the interval times calculated in fig.11 including its dependence on the parameters @xmath26 and @xmath32 .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath67 and @xmath38 corresponding to fig.12(a ) , the interval time @xmath127 is estimated to be @xmath146 , which gives a reasonable measure of the onset time scale of the doughnut - like quiescence observed in fig.12(a ) .    in the present model ,",
    "the size of the `` hole '' of the doughnut - like quiescence as well as its onset time scale have no correlation with the magnitude of the upcoming event , as has been expected from its interpretation in terms of @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "in other words , the doughnut - like quiescence is not peculiar to large events in the present model .",
    "this means that , by monitoring the onset of the `` hole '' in the seismic pattern , one can certainly deduce the time and the position of the upcoming event , but unfortunately , can not tell about its magnitude .",
    "yet , one might get some information about the magnitude of the upcoming event , not from the size and the onset time of the `` hole '' , but from the size of the `` ring '' surrounding the `` hole '' .",
    "thus , we show in figs.13 the spatial correlation functions before the mainshock in the time range @xmath147 for the case of @xmath68 and @xmath38 , with varying the magnitude range of the upcoming event . in the figure , the direction in which the rupture propagates farther in the upcoming event is always taken to be the positive direction @xmath77 , whereas the direction in which the rupture propagates less is taken to be the negative direction @xmath78 . as can be seen from the figure , although the size of the `` hole '' around the origin @xmath79 has no correlation with the magnitude of the upcoming event as mentioned above , the size of the region of the active seismicity surrounding this `` hole '' is well correlated with the size and the direction of the rupture of the upcoming event .",
    "this coincidence might enable one to deduce the position and the size of the upcoming event by monitoring the pattern of foreshocks , although it is still difficult to give a pinpoint prediction of the time of the upcoming mainshock .",
    "we note that such a correlation between the size of the seismically active region and the magnitude of the upcoming event was observed in the bk model by _ pepke et al _ [ 1994 ] , and was examined in earthquake data as well [ _ kossobokov and carlson _ , 1995 ] .    , the distance from the epicenter of the upcoming mainshock .",

    ", small events remain active in a vicinity of the epicenter of the mainshock which may be regarded as aftershocks .",
    "events are suppressed in the surrounding region where the displacement of the block was largest in the mainshock : see fig.4 .",
    "hence , it appears that the seismicity after the large event in the present model occurs so as to compensate the rupture in the mainshock .",
    "however , the seismicity near the epicenter is kept almost constant in time for some period after the mainshock , which is in apparent contrast to the power - law decay as expected from the omori law : see the insets of figs.14 . at longer time scales , the seismicity near the epicenter exhibits the non - trivial time dependence as shown in the main panel of figs.14 . in the case of @xmath67 , while the seismic activity near the epicenter seems to decay monotonically in this time range , the decay observed here is not a power - law decay as expected from the omori - law .",

    "one can predict within this scheme the time of the next event , though the size of the event is unpredictable .         in this subsection",

    "in summary , we studied the spatio - temporal correlations of the 1d bk model of earthquakes with main focus on how the statistical properties of earthquakes depend on the frictional and elastic properties of earthquake faults .",
    "we have found that when the extent of the velocity - weakening property gets smaller , the system tends to be more critical , while , as the velocity - weakening property is enhanced , the system tends to be more off - critical with enhanced features of characteristic earthquakes .",
    "periodic feature of large events is eminent when the friction force exhibits a strong frictional instability , whereas when the friction force exhibits a weak frictional instability large events often occur as twin and/or unilateral events .",
    "the model with weaker frictional instability , _ i.e. _ , the @xmath67 model , is well describable by the size - predictable model , while the model with stronger frictional instability , _ i.e. _ , the @xmath54 models , are describable neither by the size - predictable model nor the time - predictable model .",
    "we also observed several intriguing precursory phenomena associated with large events .",
    "preceding the mainshock , the frequency of smaller events is gradually enhanced , whereas just before the mainshock it is suppressed only in a close vicinity of the epicenter of the upcoming mainshock ( the mogi doughnut ) . on the other hand , the omori law of aftershocks is not observed in the present model . when the friction force exhibits a weak frictional instability , the apparent @xmath0-value of the magnitude distribution increases significantly preceding the mainshock .",
    "we note that the statistical properties analyzed here often depend sensitively on the parameter @xmath26 , but not depend much on the parameter @xmath32 , at least at qualitative level , so long as one deals with sufficiently large systems . some of the statistical properties , _",
    "e.g. _ , the global recurrence - time distribution , are subject to significant finite - size effects particularly when the parameter @xmath32 is large . in such cases , care has to be taken in separating the intrinsic bulk property of the model from the finite - size property .",
    "of course , earthquake is a complex phenomenon , and it is not a trivial matter at all how faithfully the statistical properties as observed here for the 1d bk model represent those of real earthquakes .",
    "after all , the bk model is a highly simplified statistical model where many features of real fault system have been neglected or simplified .",
    "still , the model is expected to serve as a useful reference in identifying and elucidating the nature of real earthquakes . in particular ,",
    "some of the precursory phenomena as observed here may have relevance to real earthquakes .",
