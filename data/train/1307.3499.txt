    "<S> this effect is also evident in @xmath39 for @xmath87  0.1 and 0.2  k. the slope of @xmath39 , i.e. , @xmath48 , is enhanced as @xmath11 approaches @xmath5 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) , although the behavior is hidden at 60  mk by the anomalous @xmath14 upturn in the high - field state . </S>",
    "<S> the maki parameter @xmath75 shows a large decrease on cooling near @xmath2 [ inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4(b ) ] , in good agreement with theory for strongly pauli - limited superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> it is concluded that the unusual high - field behavior can be ascribed to a strong paramagnetic depairing effect .    for a clean superconductor with a strong paramagnetic effect </S>",
    "<S> , the superconducting - to - normal phase transition is expected to change from second to first order at low temperatures  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the transition at @xmath5 oddly remains second order in cecu@xmath0si@xmath0 , indicated by a continuous change of @xmath85 across @xmath5 without hysteresis and a leveling off of @xmath75 at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> these features can not be explained simply by the paramagnetic effect for single - band superconductivity .    </S>",
    "<S> returning to the @xmath4 variation of @xmath14 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) , it can be shown that its unusual high - field behavior is related to the energy dependence of the total dos . </S>",
    "<S> in general , @xmath88{\\rm d}x,\\ ] ] where @xmath89 is the energy dependence of the total dos and the energy @xmath90 is replaced with @xmath91 . by approximating @xmath92 , which is valid near @xmath93 , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) can be rewritten as @xmath94 , where @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 are constants . </S>",
    "<S> this relationship demonstrates that the @xmath4 dependence of @xmath14 at low temperatures mimics @xmath89 at low energies .    in this context , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath4 variation in @xmath14 at each field can be understood by taking into account the presence of two gaps as well as the strong paramagnetic effect . </S>",
    "<S> theory predicts that @xmath89 has a v - shaped structure in the vortex state  @xcite , i.e. , @xmath98 near @xmath93 with an edge - singularity peak at @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> the observed kink in @xmath14 at low @xmath11 , such as at 0.6  t , is ascribed to the edge singularity of the small v - shaped dos of a minor gap superposed on the large v - shaped dos of a major gap . at higher fields , assuming the strong paramagnetic effect holds for the minor gap , </S>",
    "<S> the edge singularity is shifted toward lower energy  @xcite and an upturn in @xmath14 corresponding to the tail of the singularity in the high - energy side is observed . </S>",
    "<S> because the v - shaped dos of the major gap gradually approaches the normal - state dos with increasing field , @xmath14 can exceed the normal - state value near @xmath5 if the dos enhancement due to the edge singularity of the minor gap remains prominent . </S>",
    "<S> the upward curvature in @xmath39 near 0.5  t is a sign of the paramagnetic effect for the minor gap . while these analyses suggest that the two - band full - gap model , in the presence of a strong paramagnetic effect , can explain the anomalous @xmath68 behavior satisfactorily , there remain other possible origins , such as the occurrence of an afm ordering in the high - field superconducting state . to further confirm the pauli - limited two - gap scenario , detailed calculations of @xmath100 based on the microscopic theory are in progress @xcite .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have investigated the low - temperature specific heat and magnetization of a high - quality _ s_-type single crystal of cecu@xmath0si@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> our study has provided thermodynamic evidence for multiband superconductivity , an unexpected deficiency of nodal qp excitations , and a strong pauli paramagnetic effect in cecu@xmath0si@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the discovery of unexpectedly small qp dos at low energies challenges the long - held view of this heavy - fermion superconductor whose pairing symmetry is believed to be of the nodal @xmath1-wave type . </S>",
