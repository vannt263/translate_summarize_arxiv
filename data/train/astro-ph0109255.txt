    "in the standard big bang model of nucleosynthesis ( sbbn ) , the light isotopes d , @xmath7he , @xmath3he and @xmath8li were produced by nuclear reactions a few minutes after the birth of the universe .",
    "given the number of light neutrino species @xmath9 = 3 and the neutron lifetime , the abundances of these light elements depend on one cosmological parameter only , the baryon - to - photon ratio @xmath10 , which in turn is directly related to the density of ordinary baryonic matter @xmath11 .",
    "the ideal objects for determination of the primordial helium abundance are blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxies .",
    "these dwarf systems are the least chemically evolved galaxies known , so they contain very little helium manufactured by stars after the big bang .",
    "because the big bang production of @xmath3he is relatively insensitive to the density of matter , the primordial abundance of @xmath3he must be determined to very high precision ( better than a few percent relative accuracy ) in order to put useful constraints on @xmath12 .",
    "this precision can be achieved with very high signal - to - noise ratio optical spectra of bcds .",
    "these bcds are undergoing intense bursts of star formation , giving birth to high excitation supergiant h ii regions , which allow an accurate determination of the helium abundance in the ionized gas through the bcd s emission - line spectrum .",
    "the primordial helium mass fraction @xmath13 of @xmath3he is usually derived by extrapolating the @xmath4  o / h and @xmath4  n / h correlations to o / h = n / h = 0 , as proposed originally by peimbert & torres - peimbert ( 1974 , 1976 ) and pagel , terlevich & melnick ( 1986 )",

    "a self - consistent method was applied to correct he i emission line intensities for the collisional and fluorescent enhancement mechanisms which lead to deviations from the values predicted by recombination theory .",
    "the use of several he i lines allows one to discriminate between collisional and fluorescent enhancements which change the line intensities in different ways .",

    "the seeing was 09 .",

    "therefore some second - order contamination is present in the red parts of spectra at wavelengths @xmath18 7000 .",
    "the spectrophotometric standard stars feige 34 and hz 44 were observed for flux calibration .",
    "spectra of a hg - ne - ar comparison lamp were obtained before and after each observation to provide the wavelength calibration .",
    "data reduction of the observations was carried out at the main astronomical observatory of ukraine using the iraf software package .",
    "this reduction included bias subtraction , cosmic - ray removal and flat - field correction using exposures of a quartz incandescent lamp .",
    "after wavelength calibration , night - sky background subtraction , and correction for atmospheric extinction , each frame was calibrated to absolute fluxes . because both bcds were observed at large airmasses , the atmospheric differential refraction can be important ( filippenko 1982 ) .",
    "this effect is smaller for tol 1214277 because of its higher declination and slit position angle close to the parallactic one . to minimize the effect of the atmospheric differential refraction we extracted one - dimensional spectra from large apertures 1  @xmath16 68 for tol 1214277 and 1  @xmath16 84 for tol 65 .",

    "we point out that the flux of the [ s ii ] @xmath26717 emission line in tol 1214277 spectrum is significantly reduced due to coincidence with a night sky absorption line .",
    "this artificially low intensity results in a significant overestimate of @xmath27(s ii ) . however , the heavy element abundances in low - density h ii regions do not depend on @xmath27 .",

    "we have adopted the following procedure , discussed in more detail in itl94 and itl97 .",
    "we evaluate the electron number density @xmath27(he ii ) and the optical depth @xmath39(@xmath23889 ) in the he i @xmath23889 line in a self - consistent way , so that the he i @xmath2@xmath23889/5876 , 4471/5876 , 6678/5876 and 7065/5876 line ratios have their recombination values , after correction for collisional and fluorescent enhancement .",

    "the he i @xmath23889 and 7065 lines play an important role because they are particularly sensitive to both optical depth and electron number density .",
    "since the he i @xmath23889 line is blended with the h8 @xmath23889 line , we have subtracted the latter , assuming its intensity to be equal to 0.106 @xmath34(h@xmath20 ) ( aller 1984 ) , after correction for interstellar extinction and underlying stellar absorption in hydrogen lines .",
    "the singly ionized helium abundance @xmath38 and @xmath3he mass fraction @xmath4 is obtained for each of the three he i lines @xmath2@xmath2 4471 , 5876 and 6678 .",

    "the similarity of @xmath4 in the lowest - metallicity bcds suggests that statistical errors in the helium abundance determination are small .",
    "however , some systematic effects may change the value of @xmath4 .",
    "we already pointed out one such effect , the underlying stellar absorption , which if not accounted for , results in the underestimation of @xmath4 .",
    "this effect is more pronounced for the he i @xmath24471 emission line .",
    "recently , gonzlez delgado , leitherer & heckman ( 1999 ) have produced synthetic spectra of h balmer and he i absorption lines in starburst and poststarburst galaxies .",
    "they predict that the equivalent width of the he i @xmath24471 absorption line for young starbursts with an age @xmath43 @xmath44 5 myr , which is the case for tol 1214277 and tol 65 , can be in the range 0.4  0.6  . comparing with equivalent widths of the he i @xmath24471 emission line 7.6  and 4.8  in tol 1214277 and tol 65 ,",
    "we conclude that the underestimate of the he abundance can be as high as @xmath5 10% in the case of the he i @xmath24471 emission line . for the other two he i lines @xmath25876 and @xmath26678 lines",
    "the underestimate seems to be significantly smaller because of larger emission line equivalent widths .",
    "unfortunately , gonzlez delgado et al .",
    "( 1999 ) did not calculate equivalent widths for the he i @xmath25876 and @xmath26678 absorption lines .",
    "the weighted mean helium mass fraction in our calculations is mainly defined by the strongest he i @xmath25876 emission line with the highest weight .",
    "the upward correction of @xmath4 for this line due to the underlying stellar absorption is not larger than @xmath5 1% for tol 1214277 and @xmath5 1% ",

    "another source of systematic uncertainties comes from the assumption that the h@xmath26 and he@xmath26 zones in the h ii region are coincident .",
    "however , depending on the hardness of the ionizing radiation , the radius of the he@xmath26 zone can be smaller than the radius of the h@xmath26 zone in the case of soft ionizing radiation and larger in the case of hard radiation . in the former case ,",
    "a correction for unseen neutral helium should be made , resulting in an ionization correction factor @xmath45(he ) @xmath18 1 and hence a higher helium abundance . in the latter case ,",
    "the situation is opposite and @xmath45(he ) @xmath36 1 .",
    "furthermore , the electron temperature @xmath23 in the o@xmath24 zone derived from the collisionally excited [ o iii ] lines was assumed in our calculations to be constant and is the same as that in the h@xmath46 and he@xmath46 zones .",
    "however , @xmath23(o iii ) tends to be larger than the temperature for the recombination lines of h i and he ii and , if applied , results in an overestimate of the helium abundance .",

    "alpha - product element - to - oxygen abundance ratios are in the same range as those found for bcds .",
    "the exception is the apparently higher fe / o abundance ratio in tol 1214277 which we argue is due to the contamination of [ fe iii ] @xmath24658 emission line by c iv @xmath24658 emission .",
    "the @xmath3he mass fractions in tol 1214277 and tol 65 are respectively @xmath4 = 0.2466@xmath00.0043 and 0.2463@xmath00.0057 .",
