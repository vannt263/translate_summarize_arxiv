    "the solution of the absolute value equation ( ave ) of the following form is considered : @xmath0 here , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 denotes the component - wise absolute value of vector @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath5 .",
    "the ave ( [ eq:1 ] ) is a special case of the generalized absolute value equation ( gave ) of the type @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the gave ( [ eq:1a ] ) was introduced in @xcite and investigated in a more general context in @xcite .",
    "recently , these problems have been investigated in the literature @xcite .",
    "the ave ( [ eq:1 ] ) arises in linear programs , quadratic programs , bimatrix games and other problems , which can all be reduced to a linear complementarity problem ( lcp ) @xcite , and the lcp is equivalent to the ave ( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "this implies that ave is np - hard in its general form @xcite . beside",
    ", if @xmath9 , then the generalized ave ( [ eq:1a ] ) reduces to a system of linear equations @xmath10 , which have many applications in scientific computation @xcite .",
    "the main research of ave includes two aspects : one is the theoretical analysis , which focuses on the theorem of alternatives , various equivalent reformulations , and the existence and nonexistence of solutions ; see @xcite . and the other is how to solve the ave .",
    "we mainly pay attention to the letter .    in the last decade ,",
    "based on the fact that the lcp is equivalent to the ave and the special structure of ave , a large variety of methods for solving ave ( [ eq:1 ] ) can be found in the literature ; see @xcite .",
    "these also include the following : a finite succession of linear programs ( slp ) is established in @xcite , which arise from a reformulation of the ave as the minimization of a piecewise - linear concave function on a polyhedral set and solving the latter by successive linearization ; a semi - smooth newton method is proposed , which largely shortens the computation time than the slp method in @xcite ; furthermore , a smoothing newton algorithm is presented in @xcite , which is proved to be globally convergent and the convergence rate is quadratic under the condition that the singular values of @xmath11 exceed 1 .",
    "this condition is weaker than the one used in @xcite .",
    "recently , the picard - hss iteration method is proposed to solve ave by salkuyeh in @xcite , which is originally designed to solve weakly nonlinear systems @xcite and its generalizations are also paid attention @xcite . the sufficient conditions to guarantee the convergence of this method and some numerical experiments",
    "are given to show the effectiveness of the method .",
    "however , the numbers of the inner hss iteration steps are often problem - dependent and difficult to be determined in actual computations .",
    "moreover , the iteration vector can not be updated timely . in this paper , we present the nonlinear hss - like iteration method to overcome the defect mentioned above , which is designed originally for solving weakly nonlinear systems in @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    "the hss and picard - hss iteration methods are reviewed . in section [ sec:3 ] the nonlinear hss - like iteration method for solving ave ( [ eq:1 ] )",
    "is described .",
    "numerical experiments are presented in section [ sec:4 ] , to shown the feasibility and effectiveness of the nonlinear hss - like method .",
    "finally , some conclusions and an open problem are drew in section [ sec:5 ] .",
    "in this section , the hss iteration method for solving the non - hermitian linear systems and the picard - hss iteration method for solving the ave ( [ eq:1 ] ) are reviewed .",
    "let @xmath12 be a non - hermitian positive definite matrix , @xmath13 be a zero matrix , the gave ( [ eq:1a ] ) reduced to the non - hermitian system of linear equations @xmath14    because any square matrix @xmath11 possesses a hermitian and skew - hermitian splitting ( hss ) @xmath15 the following hss iteration method is first introduced by bai , golub and ng in @xcite for the solution of the non - hermitian positive definite system of linear equations ( [ eq:5 ] ) .     * the hss iteration method . * + given an initial guess @xmath16 , compute @xmath17 for @xmath18 using the following iteration scheme until @xmath19 converges , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a positive constant and @xmath22 is the identity matrix .",
    "when the matrix @xmath23 is positive definite , i.e. its hermitian part @xmath24 is positive definite , bai et al .",
    "proved that the spectral radius of the hss iteration matrix is less than 1 for any positive parameters @xmath25 ,",
    "i.e. , the hss iteration method is unconditionally convergent ; see @xcite . for the convenience of the subsequent discussion",
    ", the ave ( [ eq:1 ] ) can be rewritten as its equivalent form : @xmath26    recalling that the linear term @xmath27 and the nonlinear term @xmath28 are well separated and the picard iteration method is a fixed - point iteration , the picard iteration @xmath29 can be used to solve the ave ( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "when the matrix @xmath23 is large sparse and positive definite , the next iteration @xmath30 may be inexactly computed by hss iteration .",
    "this naturally lead to the following iteration method proposed in @xcite for solving the ave ( [ eq:1 ] ) .    * the picard - hss iteration method . *",
    "+ let @xmath12 be a sparse and positive definite matrix , @xmath24 and @xmath31 be its hermitian and skew - hermitian parts respectively .",
    "given an initial guess @xmath32 and a sequence @xmath33 of positive integers , compute @xmath30 for @xmath34 using the following iteration scheme until @xmath35 satisfies the stopping criterion :    \\(a ) set @xmath36    \\(b ) for @xmath37 , solve the following linear systems to obtain @xmath38 :    @xmath39    where @xmath21 is a given positive constant and @xmath22 is the identity matrix ;    \\(c ) set @xmath40 .",
    "the advantage of the picard - hss iteration method is obvious .",
    "first , the two linear sub - systems in all inner hss iterations have the same shifted hermitian coefficient matrix @xmath41 and shifted skew - hermitian coefficient matrix @xmath42 , which are constant with respect to the iteration index @xmath43 .",
    "second , as the coefficient matrix @xmath41 and @xmath42 are hermitian and skew - hermitian respectively , the first sub - system can be solved exactly by making use of the cholesky factorization and the second one by the lu factorization .",
    "the last , these two sub - systems can be solve approximately by the conjugate gradient method and a krylov subspace method like gmres , respectively ; see @xcite .",
    "in the picard - hss iteration , the numbers @xmath44 of the inner hss iteration steps are often problem - dependent and difficult to be determined in actual computations @xcite .",
    "moreover , the iteration vector can not be updated timely .",
    "thus , to avoid these defect and still preserve the advantages of the picard - hss iteration method , based on the hss ( [ eq:6 ] ) and the nonlinear fixed - point equations @xmath45 the following nonlinear hss - like iteration method is proposed to solve the ave ( [ eq:1 ] ) .",

    "it is obvious that both @xmath4 and @xmath3 in the second step are updated in the nonlinear hss - like iteration , but only @xmath4 is updated in the picard - hss iteration .",
    "furthermore , the nonlinear hss - like iteration is a monolayer iteration scheme , but the picard - hss is an inner - outer double - layer iteration scheme .    to obtain a one - step form of the nonlinear hss - like iteration",
    ", we define @xmath47 and @xmath48 then the nonlinear hss - like iteration scheme can be equivalently expressed as @xmath49    the ostrowski theorem , i.e. , theorem 10.1.3 in @xcite , gives a local convergence theory about a one - step stationary nonlinear iteration . based on this , bai et al . established the local convergence theory for the nonlinear hss - like iteration method in @xcite .",
    "however , these convergence theory has a strict requirement that @xmath28 must be @xmath50-differentiable at a point @xmath51 such that @xmath52 . obviously , the absolute value function @xmath3 is non - differentiable .",
    "thus , the convergence analysis of the nonlinear hss - like iteration method for solving weakly nonlinear linear systems is unsuitable for solving ave , and need further discuss . at the end of this section",

    "in addition , the stopping criterion for the inner iterations of the picard - hss method is set to be @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 is the number of the inner iteration steps and @xmath66 is the prescribed tolerance for controlling the accuracy of the inner iterations at the @xmath43-th outer iteration .",
