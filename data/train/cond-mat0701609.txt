    "pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 is the first pr - based heavy - fermion superconductor and attracts considerable interest because of unusual superconducting properties.@xcite one of the most interesting topics is what is the role of the multipole moments of pr @xmath7 electrons for the heavy - fermion nature and unconventional superconductivity in pros@xmath0sb@xmath1.@xcite long range magnetic dipole order does not coexist with superconductivity at zero field.@xcite instead , the existence of a magnetic field - induced ordered phase has been reported above the upper critical field @xmath8 for the superconductivity.@xcite in our previous study antiferromagnetic reflections with _ * q*_=(100 ) were observed in the field - induced ordered phase for _ * h*_@xmath2[001].@xcite the antiferromagnetic moment of 0.02@xmath3/pr at 8 t along the [ 010 ] direction perpendicular to the applied field was significantly smaller than the field - induced ferromagnetic moment parallel to _ * h*_. this small dipole moment and the @xmath9-@xmath10 phase diagram can be well explained by the mean - field calculation based on the crystal field level scheme of the @xmath5 singlet ground state with @xmath11 triplet excited state and assuming an antiferroquadrupolar ( afq ) interaction.@xcite the field - induced ordered phase appears as a result of the level crossing of the zero field ground and excited state which comes from the field split triplet state .",
    "the level scheme and its field response have been experimentally clarified by means of neutron inelastic scattering under magnetic fields.@xcite the overall aspect of the field - induced ordered phase indicates that the antiferromagnetic dipole is not a primary order parameter",
    ".    generally speaking , there are many possibilities for the primary multipole order parameters .",
    "the ordered phase is stable only under applied magnetic field , where the time reversal symmetry has been broken , thus , the antiferromagnetic dipole order appears simultaneously with the coupled order parameters such as quadrupole , octupole , and hexadecapole in the order parameter space with given @xmath12 symmetry.@xcite since neutrons exhibit no cross section for an electric quadrupole moment , the observation of the field - induced antiferromagnetic peak by neutron is not a direct proof for the primary afq order parameter . in this sense ,",
    "our previous study did not rule out possibilities of other high - rank multipoles.@xcite actually , it is shown that the qualitative features for _ * h*_@xmath2[001 ] , the induced antiferromagnetic moment perpendicular to the applied field and the phase diagram can be reproduced in terms of octupole as well as quadrupole@xcite .",
    "recent intensive studies on skutterudites report an important role of higher rank multipole , octupole@xcite and hexadecapole@xcite , in some compounds .",
    "therefore , it is indispensable to clarify strictly the dominant interaction in pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 . for this purpose ,",
    "further information is required : field direction and pressure dependencies and inelastic neutron scattering .",
    "careful magnetization measurements on pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 clarified that the field - induced ordered phase also exists for [ 110 ] and [ 111 ] with remarkable anisotropy in the @xmath9-@xmath10 phase diagram.@xcite the existence of the field - induced ordered phase for these different field directions also supports the singlet - triplet crystal field level scheme .",
    "it has been pointed out that the anisotropy in the phase diagram is intrinsic to @xmath12 symmetry and the predominance of quadrupolar interaction.@xcite the field - induced ordered states for both _ * h*_@xmath2[110 ] and [ 111 ] are also considered to be the afq ordered phase and not to be the dipolar one .",
    "the order parameter for _ * h*_@xmath2[110 ] was theoretically predicted to be @xmath4@xcite , but has not been confirmed so far .",
    "if this is the case , one could discriminate the primary order parameter of non - magnetic quadrupole from coupled magnetic octupole since the induced antiferromagnetic moment direction is expected to be different between them .",

    "it should be stressed that the total hamiltonian in the limit , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , reduces to the conventional dimer - spin model@xcite , in which a similar field - induced order takes place by the magnetic interaction .",
    "thus , it is quite instructive to see the difference between quadrupolar and magnetic interactions by interpolating the two limits .    in the framework of the mean - field theory ,",

    "the observed antiferromagnetic moment parallel to the field is regarded as strong evidence of the predominant afq interaction .",

    "this characteristic moment direction reflecting the lack of four - fold symmetry gives the important information on the possible order parameter .",
    "variation in the orientation of the field - induced antiferromagnetic moment according to the applied field direction is characteristic to the quadrupolar ordered phase .",
    "both results indicate the predominance of the @xmath4-type afq interaction in pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 .",
    "a recent inelastic neutron scattering study clarified that the crystal field excitations from the @xmath5 ground state to the @xmath11 triplet first excited state have a dispersion ; the observed excitation softens at _ * q * _ = ( 100 ) which is the same as the ordering vector of the field - induced afq ordered state.@xcite in addition , the intensity at _ * q*_=(100 ) is weaker than that at zone center .",
    "though the magnetic and non - magnetic interaction gives the same energy dispersion , the _ * q * _ dependences of the intensity are opposite;@xcite namely , magnetic interaction should lead to the stronger intensity at the zone boundary .",
    "thus , the observed excitation spectra indicate the dominance of antiferroquadrupolar interaction which is quite consistent with the present result for _ * h*_@xmath2[110 ] . together with the anisotropy in the @xmath9-@xmath10 phase diagram , the predominance of afq interaction is clarified in pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , the excitation observed in the inelastic scattering study gives an interaction strength .",
    "note that the quadrupolar coupling constant obtained from the inelastic scattering is almost consistent with that used in the present study .",
    "there is a slight difference in the definition ; @xmath93 in the present paper can be connected with @xmath94 in ref . with @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the off - diagonal matrix elements of quadrupolar moments between singlet and triplet .",
    "taking this difference into account , the coupling constant @xmath97 - 2.7k derived from inelastic spectra is consistent with @xmath982.4k used in the present study .",
    "in addition , the quadrupolar coupling constant @xmath99 obtained from the ultrasound measurements of @xmath100 is also consistent with the present value.@xcite in other words , the coupling constant used in the present study corresponds with those obtained in the other measurements .",
    "the maximum in the induced antiferromagnetic moment , @xmath27 , corresponds well to the @xmath101 anomaly in the magnetization@xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "however , no change in the antiferromagnetic structure was found on passing through @xmath27 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] , the induced @xmath52 appears to vanish slightly above 10 t .",
