    "systems of ultracold bosonic gases in optical lattices represent nowadays a popular research topic @xcite , as they establish a versatile bridge between the field of ultracold quantum matter and solid - state systems @xcite .",
    "in particular , they can be experimentally controlled with a yet unprecedented level of precision @xcite . with this",
    "it is now possible to achieve strong correlations and , due to the absence of impurities , they are viewed as idealized condensed matter systems , which allow for a clear theoretical analysis @xcite and which are even predestined as universal quantum simulators @xcite .",
    "recently a new degree of freedom to tune the properties of quantum matter has emerged which is based on a real - time modulation of some lattice parameter .",
    "for instance , it was predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite and later on confirmed experimentally in refs .",
    "@xcite that the bose - hubbard model for a periodically shaken optical lattice can be approximately reduced for a sufficiently large frequency to an effective time - independent bose - hubbard model with a renormalized hopping parameter .",
    "this technique was recently applied to induce dynamically the mott - insulator ( mi ) to superfluid ( sf ) transition @xcite .",
    "other proposed applications concern the quantum simulation of frustrated classical magnetism as well as the generation of abelian and non - abelian gauge fields @xcite . recently , this line of research culminated in the experimental realization of the hofstadter or harper hamiltonian with ultracold atoms in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "another method to periodically drive an ultracold quantum gas system relies on a periodic modulation of the s - wave scattering length @xcite , which can be experimentally achieved , for instance , in the vicinity of a broad feshbach resonance @xcite . for a harmonically trapped bose - einstein condensate",
    "this induces various phenomena of nonlinear dynamics as , for instance , mode coupling , higher harmonics generation , and significant shifts in the frequencies of collective modes ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "therefore , a periodic modulation of the interaction represents an important new tool for building more versatile quantum simulators .    in this work",
    "we investigate the effect of a periodic modulation of the s - wave scattering length for bosons in an optical lattice . using the floquet formalism",
    "we show that the underlying driven bose - hubbard model can be understood for large enough driving frequencies in terms of an effective conditional hopping in the sense that its value depends on the respective particle numbers of the involved neighboring sites @xcite .",
    "such conditional hopping amplitudes represent an interesting class of models , which have an intricate history in condensed matter physics . correlated or conditional hopping already appeared , for instance , in the very first paper , where the hubbard model was proposed , due to matrix elements of the coulomb interaction between nearest neighbor wannier wave functions @xcite",
    ". however , such occupation - dependent hopping terms are usually smaller than the typical hopping and on - site interaction , so they can be neglected .",
    "later on , such terms were reconsidered as an alternative scheme for high-@xmath0 superconductivity @xcite . for particular parameter values",
    "the hamiltonian for a hubbard chain turns out to be integrable @xcite and displays fractional statistics @xcite .",
    "the occupation - number sensitivity of tunnelling was even implemented experimentally by employing the high - resolution quantum gas microscope technique @xcite .",
    "whereas all these works deal with real - valued conditional hopping terms , a density - dependent peirls phase was recently proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of realizing anyons in one - dimensional lattices .",
    "one goal of this work is to develop analytical tools in order to study the the quantum phase diagram of conditional hopping models in quantitative detail .    in the following we focus on the case of a 2d square and a 3d cubic lattice , where the conditional hopping allows to tune the superfluid - mott insulator quantum phase transition .",
    "consequences for the one - dimensional lattice problem have already been discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a large enough driving induces pair superfluidity . in section [ section2 ]",
    "we review in detail how the periodically driven bose - hubbard model reduces approximately to an effective time - independent model with conditional hopping . afterwards , we combine in section [ section3 ] different analytical approaches with quantum monte - carlo ( qmc ) simulations in order to determine how the mi - sf quantum phase boundary depends on the driving amplitude .",
    "a more quantitative analysis in section [ section4 ] shows that the effect of driving can even be described within the usual bose - hubbard model provided that the hopping is rescaled appropriately with the driving amplitude .",
    "this finding indicates that the bose - hubbard model with a periodically driven s - wave scattering length and the usual bose - hubbard model belong to the same universality class from the point of view of critical phenomena .",
    "we start with the derivation that a bose - hubbard hamiltonian with a periodic modulation of the s - wave scattering length can approximately be mapped for large driving frequencies with the help of floquet theory to an effective time - independent hamiltonian with a conditional hopping .      in the following",
    "we study a system of spinless bosons in a homogeneous lattice of arbitrary dimension @xmath1 with a periodically modulated s - wave scattering length @xcite , which can be experimentally achieved , for instance , in the vicinity of a broad feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "this periodically driven quantum many - body system is described by the time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath2   \\left(\\hat{n}_{i}^{2}-\\hat{n}_{i}\\right ) -\\mu \\hat{n}_{i } \\right\\ } \\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\sum_{ij}t_{ij}\\hat{a}^{\\dag}_{i}\\hat{a}_{j }   \\ , .",

    "furthermore , @xmath6 stand for the respective hopping matrix elements between the sites @xmath7 and @xmath8 , which are usually non - zero only for nearest neighboring sites @xmath7 and @xmath8 with @xmath9 .",
    "the local time - independent part depends on the repulsive on - site energy @xmath10 as well as on the chemical potential @xmath11 due to the grand - canonical description .",
    "furthermore , the periodic modulation of the s - wave scattering length is described by the amplitude @xmath12 and the frequency @xmath13 .",
    "thus , the external driving leads to a quadratic dependence on the particle number operator , whereas a shaken optical lattice only involves a corresponding linear dependence @xcite .      for the sake of generality",
    "we observe that the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) is of the form @xmath14 -\\sum_{ij}t_{ij}\\hat{a}^{\\dag}_{i}\\hat{a}_{j }   \\ , , \\label{hh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the local time - independent part reads @xmath15 and the local time - dependent part is described by the operator @xmath16 in the following we perform a detailed analysis of the general hamiltonian ( [ hh ] ) with arbitrary operators @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in view of choosing a suitable basis , we start with collecting all local terms in the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath19 \\,,\\hspace*{1 mm } \\label{h0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which fulfills the periodicity condition @xmath20 with period @xmath21 .",

    "this yields the floquet functions @xmath37 represents the occupation number basis at site @xmath7 , and the floquet eigenvalues read @xmath38 furthermore , demanding the periodicity condition ( [ p ] ) for the floquet functions ( [ sol ] ) requires that the quantum number @xmath39 must be an integer .",
    "thus , the quasienergy spectrum ( [ fe ] ) repeats itself periodically on the energy axis .",
    "now we further investigate the full floquet hamiltonian @xmath40 within the extended hilbert space by determining its corresponding matrix elements with respect to the floquet functions : @xmath41 using ( [ hh ] ) and ( [ sc])([fe ] ) these matrix elements turn out to be @xmath42 \\delta_{\\ { n'_{i}\\},\\ { n_{i}\\ } } \\nonumber \\\\   & & -\\sum_{ij } t_{ij } \\langle \\{n'_{i}\\}|\\hat{a}^{\\dag}_{i } j_{m - m^{'}}\\left ( g(\\hat{n}_{i},\\hat{n}_{j } ) \\right)\\hat{a}_{j }    represents a bessel function of first kind with the argument @xmath43 now it is in order to take into account the physical constraints upon the driving frequency @xmath13 .",
    "on the one hand the excitation energy @xmath44 must be much smaller than the gap between the lowest and the first excited energy band , otherwise a single - band bose - hubbard model would no longer be a valid description . on the other hand the excitation energy @xmath44 must also be much larger than the system parameters @xmath6 and @xmath10 , so that transitions between states with @xmath45 are highly suppressed @xcite .",
    "thus , in the latter case only terms with @xmath46 have to be taken into account , so the original time - dependent hamiltonian ( [ hh ] ) is mapped approximately to the effective time - independent hamiltonian @xmath47 specializing ( [ g ] ) and ( [ heff0 ] ) for the case of a periodic modulation of the s - wave scattering length ( [ f ] ) and ( [ g ] ) then finally yields @xcite : @xmath48\\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\sum_{ij}t_{ij}\\hat{a}_{i}^{\\dag}j_{0}\\left(\\frac{a}{\\hbar \\omega}(\\hat{n}_{j}-\\hat{n}_{i})\\right)\\hat{a}_{j } \\ , .",

    "according to ( [ heff ] ) we can then conclude that the effect of the time - periodic modulation of the s - wave scattering length essentially leads to a renormalization of the hopping matrix elements .",
    "but in contrast to the shaken optical lattice treated in ref .",
    "@xcite , this renormalization yields an effective conditional hopping in the sense that it depends via the bessel function @xmath49 on the respective particle numbers @xmath50 and @xmath51 at the involved sites @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
