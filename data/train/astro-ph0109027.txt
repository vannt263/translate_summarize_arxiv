    "the heating of the solar corona has been a riddle since the discovery of the high coronal temperature by edln and grotrian in the late 1930 s .",
    "does the heating process leave any other signature ?",
    "there are many proposals on possible sources of energy ( e.g. reviews in ulmschneider , rosner & priest 1991 ) , but proof can only come from observations of the corona . of particular interest",
    "are temporal variations in coronal temperature , density and energy content , as they may reveal clues on the nature of any non - stationary heating process .    in the quiet corona on which we concentrate here",
    ", small brightenings above the network of the magnetic field were first discovered in deep soft x - ray exposures by yohkoh / sxt ( krucker et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the events were reported to have a typical thermal energy of @xmath0erg , and to occur at a rate of 1200 per hour extrapolated over the whole sun .",
    "these micro - events seem to be present at all times ( pre et al .",
    "2001 ) and also in coronal holes ( koutchmy et al . 1997 ) .",
    "thus they represent a population of continuous dynamic coronal phenomena , quite different from the more sporadic regular flares occurring in active regions that are strongly related to solar activity and its cycle .",
    "micro - events also appear different from x - ray bright points discovered by skylab that emerge at a rate of 62 per hour averaged over the whole sun and persist on average for 8 hours ( golub et al .",
    "the radiative energy loss during the bright point s lifetime is of the order of @xmath1 erg .",
    "they seem to be the place of frequent micro - events ( pre & phillips 1999 ) .",
    "more sensitive measurements of micro - events became possible with eit and trace .",
    "benz & krucker ( 1998 ) and berghmans , clette & moses ( 1998 ) found independently that the coronal emission measure in quiet regions observed in euv iron lines fluctuates locally at time scales of a few minutes in a majority of pixels including even the intracell regions . at the level of 3 standard deviations ,",
    "krucker & benz ( 1998 , thereafter kb ) reported the equivalent of 1.1@xmath2 coronal micro - events per hour over the whole sun for soho / eit observations .",
    "benz & krucker ( 1998 ) noted a nearly linear relation between inferred averaged input power and radiative loss per pixel .    in the transition region of the quiet sun ,",
    "line emissions have been observed to have localized brightenings and explosive events ( brueckner & bartoe 1983 , dere 1994 ) at a rate increasing with instrumental sensitivity ( porter et al.1987 ; harrison 1997 ) .",
    "winebarger et al .",
    "( 2001 ) estimate that explosive events observed in soho / sumer line broadenings contain an upward energy flux corresponding to about 10% of the required energy to heat the corona .",
    "habbal ( 1992 ) and brkovi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have pointed out that some of them are associated with a coronal brightening , others are not .",
    "here we concentrate on events that have an impact on the corona .",
    "thus we search for an observable change of the energy density in localized regions in the corona .",
    "the energy of coronal micro - events can be estimated from their peak temperature and emission measure or from enhanced line intensities integrated over events .",
    "the two methods are orthogonally different , the first measuring the input , the second the output .",
    "the two methods split again by the choice of the spatial association : _ ( i ) _ the enhancements in individual pixels , thus in a given area , has been previously analyzed .",
    "the density and thermal energy of the new material are difficult to estimate , as the depth of the event can not be observed . _",
    "( ii ) _ the energy inputs into adjacent brightening pixels can be added to events .",
    "the combination of active pixels to events requires some non - trivial assumptions .",
    "the advantage of integrating over events lies in the possibility to estimate the depth from shape and size of the projected area .",
    "these choices constitute 4 completely different ways to derive the energy input by micro - events .",
    "the resulting distributions are critically reviewed and compared below .",
    "the terms `` microflare '' and `` nanoflare '' have been introduced as theoretical concepts referring to subresolution reconnection events ( parker 1983 ) . soon after , observers used them for small flare - like brightenings below previous thresholds in active regions ( e.g. lin et al .",
    "1984 ; gary et al . 1997 ) . here",
    "we use the term `` micro - event '' to denote short enhancements of coronal emissions in the energy range of about @xmath3erg in quiet regions .",
    "the lower limit is given by current instrumental thresholds , and the upper limit refers to the largest events occurring typically in a quiet region of a few arcminutes size within one hour .    in section 2",
    "we discuss the variability of the quiet corona and present examples of individual pixels for illustration ; the various energies involved are discussed and compared . event selection and energy distributions are assessed in section 3 .",
    "we use the data originally presented by kb and benz & krucker ( 1998 ) as the base to critically review the published event definitions and to investigate their effects .",
    "the results are discussed in section 4 .",
    "section 5 gives conclusions and suggestions for future work .",
    "temporal changes of coronal emissions are ideal for testing heating models . in this section ,",
    "observations of such changes are presented . the energy associated with events",
    "is often inferred from the emission measure , @xmath4 , of soft x - rays or coronal euv lines .",
    "we define @xmath5 , where the integration in @xmath6 is along the line of sight , @xmath7 is the area or pixel size , and the density @xmath8 refers to the plasma in the temperature range given by the observed emission process .",
    "the emission measure is proportional to the emission in a line for a given temperature .    in the following ,",
    "the emphasis is on emission lines observed in the two wavelength bands , 171   and 195  , including lines of fe ix / x and fe xii , respectively , with diagnostic capabilities in the range of plasma temperatures of about 1.1 - 1.9@xmath2k .",
    "these coronal lines dominate the observed parts of the euv spectrum , and their large photon fluxes provide higher sensitivity than previous observations in soft x - rays . using lines of different ionization states , the emission measure in a range of temperatures",
    "can be derived .",
    "the ratio of the emission in two lines also defines an isothermal temperature .",
    "the derived parameters are to be taken as formal values , representing weighted means over the sensitive temperature range .",
    "the line - ratio temperature and emission measure have been determined for each pixel at each time step from observations by the extreme ultraviolet imaging telescope ( eit ) on soho ( delaboudinire et al .",
    "1995 ) and trace ( handy et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the variability of the quiet corona near the center of the disk is illustrated in fig .",
    "the presented observing run lasted from 14:30 to 15:15 ut on july 12 , 1996 , when solar activity was almost at the lowest level during the most recent solar minimum .",
    "the time resolution is 127.8 s and the pixel size 2.62 \" ( 1900 km on the sun ) .",
    "the error bars of the emission measure have been estimated from the low @xmath9 values of distribution of the largest enhancements in the time series ( fig.2 ) . as there are non - gaussian variations clearly visible in fig.2 , these error bars are upper limits .",
    "they are also the basis to estimate the accuracy of the temperature ( fig.1 , right ) .",
    "the pixel shown in fig . 1 is typical for a location above the magnetic network .",
    "the emission measure increases significantly twice within 42 minutes with peaks at 15:00 and @xmath10 15:14 ut . a third event at 14:45 ut is marginal . in the event at 15:00 ut the temperature peaks shortly before the emission measure in agreement with previous reports ( e.g. cross - correlation by benz & krucker 1999 ) .",
    "statistics on the variability of all pixels are presented in fig .",
    "the values are normalized to the standard deviation of each pixel .",
    "it was derived in the following way ( benz & krucker 1998 ) : first , the average photon noise @xmath11 in each pixel was evaluated and the distribution was plotted in these units . then a distribution calculated from gaussian noise was fitted to the 0 - 3 @xmath11 part .",
    "the noise it represents is the maximum limited by the condition that it can not be larger than the observed distribution plus 3 times the standard error .",
    "the fitted curve represents an effective @xmath9 , 20% larger than @xmath11 .",
    "finally fig .",
    "2 was plotted in units of @xmath9 .",
    "there is a non - gaussian , enhanced tail in the distribution of the difference between maximum and minimum during the time series ( fig.2 ) .",
    "as the fit may include small noise - like , but real fluctuations , the fitting curve is an upper limit of the noise contribution .",
    "the fraction of the pixels with non - gaussian deviations is 72% ( ratio of integrals under dashed curve to full curve in fig.2 ) .",
    "this percentage is a lower limit on the pixels with significant changes of the emission measure .",
    "the surface of the network covers about 10% of the quiet sun ( rutten & hogenaar 2001 ) . since more than 72% of the pixels in a quiet region",
    "brighten within 42 minutes , the statistics in fig.2 indicates that many intracell regions vary significantly over one hour , confirming previous results ( cf .",
    "the temperature of the material causing the emission measure increase is best derived from the largest events .",
    "figure 3 shows the temperature in the 29 largest events that occurred in a 7x7 field within 42 minutes ( data from krucker & benz 2000 ) .",
    "the observed temperature range is from 0.9 to 1.6@xmath2k .",
    "the lower limit may originate from the temperature sensitivity of the lines used .",
    "the upper limit of the observed range is not limited by the observing method .",
    "it is consistent with the temperatures derived from yohkoh / sxt using different filtergrams of the soft x - ray continuum ( krucker et al .",
    "the average temperature of the events plotted in fig.3 is 1.34@xmath12k at an average emission measure of 2.3@xmath13@xmath14 .",
    "a slight and apparently significant correlation between temperature and emission measure is discernible in the micro - events of fig.3 ( cross - correlation coefficient @xmath15 = 0.34 , @xmath8 = 29 , significance @xmath16% ) .",
    "however , the slope of the regression line is relatively flat : @xmath17}\\ \\ .\\ ] ] the determination of the above correlation significance does not include the errors of individual measurements .",
    "they are of the order of 5% for the emission measure and 10% for the temperature . if they are included , the data displayed in fig .",
    "3 are compatible with no relation between emission measure and temperature .",
    "_ radiation energy _    the energy of micro - events has been estimated from the radiation output in euv lines .",
    "the emission in one line has to be integrated over the event and the total radiation of the plasma ( say 1 - 300 ) to be inferred from some temperature estimate and an emissivity code ( such as spex or chianti ) .",
    "note that the radiation is considered only during the time the plasma is within the range of sensitive temperatures .",
    "other losses , in particular conduction , may also have to be taken into account to estimate the total energy output .",
    "thus the radiative output underestimates the energy loss .",
    "measuring the radiation output has the advantage that the line of sight thickness of the micro - event does not have to be modeled .",
    "the disadvantage is the assumption of the temperature .    _",
    "thermal energy _    a completely different way to estimate the energy measures the thermal energy content at a given time .",
    "one observes two lines and determines the temperature from the line ratio .",
    "using the same element at two ionization states , the line ratio defines an average temperature @xmath18 .",
    "this allows the determination of an emission measure relevant for the plasma within the range of temperatures appropriate for the two lines .",
    "as the measurements are made at peak flux , more events in a larger energy range can be studied .",
    "the results are more propitious because the information from two lines is used .",
    "the thermal energy of the material exceeding a given threshold @xmath19 is @xmath20 eq .",
    "( 2 ) includes the contributions of both electrons and ions , assumed to have the same temperature .",
    "the electron density in the source region , @xmath21 , is determined from the observable increase in emission measure @xmath22 , @xmath23 dv}\\ \\ \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the background density before the event and @xmath25 is the density of the newly added material . for simplicity",
    "let us consider here constant densities in the volume @xmath26 before the event and in @xmath27 , the volume into which the new material is injected .",
    "the emission measure can easily be evaluated for two extreme cases yielding the same observed enhancement : _ ( i ) : _ @xmath28 in the same volume , @xmath29 , i.e. low density material is newly injected into the old volume , and _ ( ii ) : _",
    "@xmath30 , i.e. high density material is injected into a small part of the old volume , @xmath31 . in the first case",
    "the density of the newly added material can be estimated from    @xmath32    in the second case the density of the newly added material is    @xmath33    brown et al.(2000 ) have evaluated some realistic models in detail and have found differences in the derived densities by a factor of two .",
    "we will assume the second case in the following and write @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the filling factor of the newly added material and @xmath7 is the observed area .",
    "the parameter @xmath36 represents an effective line - of - sight thickness of the new material .",
    "it includes the filling factor for multi - pixel events and corrects also for cases with smaller event area than the pixel size .",
    "it is a model parameter and has been assumed to be 5000 km in kb , which is probably an overestimate for small events",
    ". a lower limit may be estimated from the assumption that the smallest observable events extend about the length of a pixel ( 2000 km ) with half its diameter ( 1000 km ) , thus @xmath37 500 km .",
    "combining eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 5 ) , the change in thermal energy amounts to @xmath38 enhancements both in emission measure and temperature occur in fig.1 .",
    "the thermal energy of the corona can increase either by adding material previously `` invisible '' ( e.g. heated chromospheric material ) or by increasing the temperature of coronal material . for illustration we evaluate the event peaking at 15:00 ut .",
    "the increase @xmath39@xmath40 indicates heating of chromospheric material , thus @xmath41 .",
    "even for an @xmath36 of only 500 km and without subtracting a background , the required energy is @xmath42erg .",
    "thus the example suggests that heating new material to coronal temperatures in micro - events is a major energy input .",
    "other temperature variations in fig.1 are of the order of @xmath43k .",
    "the average emission measure of the pixel in fig.1 is @xmath44 @xmath14 where @xmath45 is the pixel area . at a constant emission measure",
    "the temperature variations would amount to less than 10% of the above energy .",
    "temperature variations at constant emission measure thus constitute negligible heating . surprisingly , the dominant variability of the coronal energy content is not in temperature but in emission measure .",
    "the reported emission measure increases have been measured at peak value , but conduction and radiation losses occur also during the rise phase of an event . as the rise time in micro - events",
    "is comparable to the decay time , about half of the radiative loss occurs before the peak .",
    "thus the thermal energy at peak underestimates the total energy input by at least a factor of two .",
    "more detailed calculations on this problem have been presented by brown et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .    _ gravitational energy",
    "_    the gravitational energy of relatively large heating events has been estimated by several authors ( e.g. brown et al .",
    "it amounts to a few percent of the thermal energy estimated above and will be neglected in the following .",
    "_ isothermal expansion _    for an expansion along a flux tube of constant diameter @xmath46 , the electron density decreases inversely proportional to the enlargement .",
    "we assume a homogeneous volume with the initial density @xmath24 in the chromosphere expanding homogeneously to the coronal value of @xmath25 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the temperature is not seen to decrease from a very high value , thus the expansion may be modeled as being isothermal .",
    "the expansion energy can then be approximated to    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the total particle pressure , and @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the initial and final extensions , respectively , of the newly heated material along the loop .",
    "the expansion energy exceeds the thermal energy by the factor @xmath53 . for realistic values of chromospheric and coronal densities",
    ", this factor is about 3 .",
    "the energy is liberated when the injected material cools and concentrates again in a smaller volume .",
    "as most of the micro - events in the quiet corona seem to take place in closed loops , this is the case for most of the expansion energy .",
    "the combined input power including heating and expansion may be written in terms of @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the observed input of thermal energy in the observing time @xmath56 @xmath57 the factor @xmath58 covers the losses before the emission measure is determined at its peak .",
    "it may be noted here that the sum @xmath59 is reduced in case of a small filling factor of the injected material .",
    "the factor @xmath60 takes into account that the observations are based on the secondary effect of heating and evaporation . as primary plasma motions and waves may result from the energy release , @xmath61 . for reconnection",
    ", @xmath62 has been estimated in the mhd limit ( e.g. priest & forbes 2000 ) .",
    "eq.(9 ) equates finally the input to the output . in the previous literature , the radiative output",
    "@xmath63 has been estimated from the observed coronal emission measure ( @xmath64k ) and the line - ratio temperature .",

    "this second look at the eit data has shown general agreement with trace , if the same methods are used ( tab.2 ) . as a best approach",
    ", we suggest a small tolerance ( @xmath68 min ) in the timing of adjacent pixels to be summed up to events . a height model that assumes a smaller effective line - of - sight thickness for smaller events",
    "is probably more appropriate ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "then a power - law index of @xmath67 = 2.3@xmath70 results from eit data ( third column in tab.2 ) .",
    "the above height model reduces the observed thermal input energy by micro - flares from 16% ( kb ) to about 5% of the radiated output ( @xmath64k ) . to account for the nanoflare heating scenario , the observed micro - events have to either continue to much lower energies or to provide more energy per event than the measured thermal part , or both .",
    "the simple considerations on energy inputs and outputs in sect . 2 suggest that this percentage may have to be multiplied by a factor of @xmath71 to include the other forms of energy involved in micro - events .",
    "we note that this factor has an upper limit given by the observed energy output .",
    "the more energy the observed micro - events contain , the less micro - events below the current energy threshold may contribute .",
    "the latter constitute a part of the unresolved background in the `` nanoflare heating '' scenario .",
    "thus the background between observable micro - events may eventually fall below the observed minimum value if the energy input were mostly by the larger events",
    ". the observed emission measure time profile of single pixels does not show such gaps . on the contrary , as illustrated in fig.1 the discernible events reside on top of a background . in numerical simulations assuming @xmath72=1 , mitra kraev & benz ( 2001 ) find a best fit of the observed fourier power spectrum in time with @xmath73 ( adapted to the average temperature found here ) .",
    "the factor @xmath74 is different from the others as it constitutes a non - impulsive , possibly non - local heating enhancing the background level .",
    "a scenario is conceivable where waves travel from the energy release site across magnetic field lines for tens of pixels ( @xmath75 km ) .",
    "the superposition of waves from many events could form a quasi - steady turbulent background .",
    "such an energy input amounts to `` dark power '' as it does not manifest itself in variability .",
    "its dissipation would heat the coronal background emission measure without changing the power spectrum .",
    "the low - energy cutoff of the energy distribution would then have to be accordingly higher to fit the observed level .    in view of the simulations and",
    "the estimate of @xmath62 , the micro - events observed in the thermal energy range @xmath76erg ( fig.7 ) suggest a total power input of about 12% relative to the inferred output of the same quiet - sun field of view .",
    "nanoflares have originally been introduced as simple energy inputs retaining the high temperature of the corona .",
    "recent observations indicate persistently that micro - events behave much more like real flares , heating initially cold material and increasing the material content of the low corona . as shown by brown et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , the transition layer reacts very sensitively to coronal heating and particle impact .",
    "most easily observable in coronal heating is not the primary energy discharge that may well occur in the corona , but the reaction of the chromosphere and the evaporation of hot material .",
    "the latter has apparently been observed in micro - events of the quiet sun .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that they are secondary phenomena must not be forgotten when the energy of the whole event is estimated .",
    "in particular the expansion energy , losses during the rise time and the release of other forms of energy have to be added .",
    "micro - events are not wave - like , but waves may be excited by the events that travel across field lines and into the upper corona . although the thermal energy of observed micro - events is not sufficient for the coronal heating , micro - events are now the best source of information and evidence on the heating process of the quiet corona .",
    "individual micro - events have many physical properties in common with regular flares .",
    "however , their location and statistical behavior are different .",
    "the observed variability of the quiet corona takes place at low altitudes , mostly below 10@xmath77 km .",
    "this is different from active regions , where extremely bright , quasi - stationary loops extend to more than an order of magnitude larger altitude .",
    "the quiet corona at low height appears simpler and more uniform from the point of view of loop length and temperature range . in any case , the micro - events are a less sporadic phenomenon than regular flares and are not known to correlate with solar activity .",
    "therefore , contrary to the suggestions by aschwanden et al .",
    "( 2000b , fig.10 ) , the energy distribution of micro - events can not be directly compared with regular flares .",
    "micro - events in quiet regions and flares in active regions form statistically different populations .",
    "it may be noted here that the variability even increases at lower temperatures ( berghmans et al .",
    "1998 ) and has a maximum in the transition region , where the time scales are shorter and the temporal power spectrum is flattest ( benz & krucker 1999 ) .",
    "this suggests that a more complete modeling of flare - like events at the interface of corona and chromosphere is highly desirable . as the observed variability is not wave - like , it is the best indicator for the relevance of the `` nanoflare scenario '' .",
    "mitra kraev & benz ( 2001 ) have proven by simulations the existence of a nanoflare model that can explain all observed facts relevant to the heating of the quiet corona .",
    "nanoflare heating thus can not be excluded as some previous authors have claimed .",
    "the time of quick progress in micro - events is clearly over .",
    "low - corona variability has opened a new , vast and largely still unexplored field . only studies that investigate carefully the persisting problems can bring progress .",
    "one of them will be the detailed investigation of even smaller single events at high spatial and temporal resolution .",

    "<S> recent imaging observations of euv line emissions have shown evidence for frequent flare - like events in a majority of the pixels in quiet regions of the solar corona . </S>",
    "<S> the changes in coronal emission measure indicate impulsive heating of new material to coronal temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> these heating or evaporation events are candidate signatures of `` nanoflares '' or `` microflares '' proposed to interpret the high temperature and the very existence of the corona . </S>",
    "<S> the energy distribution of these micro - events reported in the literature differ widely , and so do the estimates of their total energy input into the corona . here </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the assumptions of the different methods , compare them by using the same data set and discuss their results .    </S>",
    "<S> we also estimate the different forms of energy input and output , keeping in mind that the observed brightenings are most likely secondary phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> a rough estimate of the energy input observed by eit on the soho satellite is of the order of 10% of the total radiative output in the same region . </S>",
    "<S> it is considerably smaller for the two reported trace observations . </S>",
    "<S> the discrepancy can be explained partially by different thresholds for flare detection . </S>",
    "<S> there is agreement on the slope and the absolute value of the distribution if the same method were used and a numerical error corrected . </S>",
    "<S> the extrapolation of the power law to unobserved energies that are many orders of magnitude smaller remains questionable . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , these micro - events and unresolved smaller events are currently the best source of information on the heating process of the corona . </S>"
