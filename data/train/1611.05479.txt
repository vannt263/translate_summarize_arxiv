    "brain function results from communication between neurons connected by complex synaptic networks .",
    "synapses are themselves highly complex and diverse signaling machines , containing protein products of hundreds of different genes , some in hundreds of copies , arranged in precise lattice at each individual synapse .",
    "synapses are fundamental not only to synaptic network function but also to network development , adaptation , and memory . in addition , abnormalities of synapse numbers or molecular components are implicated in most mental and neurological disorders . despite their obvious importance",
    ", mammalian synapse populations have so far resisted detailed quantitative study . in human brains and most animal nervous systems ,",
    "synapses are very small and very densely packed : there are approximately 1 billion synapses per cubic millimeter of human cortex .",
    "this volumetric density poses very substantial challenges to proteometric analysis at the critical level of the individual synapse .",
    "the present work describes new probabilistic image analysis methods for single - synapse analysis of synapse populations in both animal and human brains , in health and disorder .",
    "deeper understanding of the basic mechanisms and pathologies of the brain s synaptic networks will require a much clearer and more quantitative understanding of the vast populations of highly diverse individual synapses that compose those networks . as a step toward such understanding , we here introduce and characterize novel image analysis methods for the high - throughput single - synapse molecular profiling of synapse populations from multiplex fluorescence microscopy ( muxfm ) ; in the present report we focus on immunofluorescence array tomography ( if - at ) image data . coupled with high - throughput and high - resolution muxfm image acquisition methods",
    ", these image analysis approaches will permit single - synapse analysis at scale of billions of synapses , as required to fully characterize normal and pathological specimens of mammalian neocortex , e.g. , @xcite @xcite .",
    "single - synapse profiling of large and diverse synapse populations poses formidable challenges .",
    "electron microscopy ( em ) of appropriately labeled specimens defines the current ` gold standard ' for synapse detection : the nanometer resolution of em is necessary for the unambiguous identification of defining synaptic features such as presynaptic vesicles , synaptic clefts , and postsynaptic densities .",
    "unfortunately em data acquisition is technically difficult , slow , burdened by large data processing and storage requirements , and offers only limited capacities to discriminate amongst the hundreds of different synaptic proteins that constitute the synaptic proteome .",
    "in contrast , fluorescence microscopy ( fm ) of tagged specimens is much faster and less expensive , easier to segment for analysis , and offers much greater molecular discrimination power .",
    "unfortunately , the ability of fm to detect and discriminate individual synapses is compromised by resolution limits and the close crowding of synapses in most neural tissue specimens of interest .",
    "robust fm detection of synapses is nonetheless potentially possible by combining measures that extend resolution limits and multiplexing for localization and co - localization of synaptic markers . in designing the algorithm and software reported here , we first relied on images acquired with conjugate array tomography ( cat ) , which combines the strengths of fm - at with those of electron microscopic array tomography ( em - at ) , allowing both em and muxfm imaging of individual cortical specimens .",
    "array tomography s ultrathin physical sectioning provides z - axis resolution far beyond the light microscopic diffraction limit , as well as high sensitivity and high lateral resolution , while greatly simplifying voxel - conjugate registration of fm - at and em - at images .",
    "fm - at can moreover multiplex large numbers of synaptic markers by its combination of sequential and spectral label multiplexing .",
    "thus , cat provides an ideal platform for the development and rigorous design and testing of algorithms aimed at single - synapse molecular analysis and population molecular profiling .",
    "the remarkable structural and molecular diversity within mammalian synapse populations challenges our present biological understanding of how to define a synapse .",
    "difficulties also arise from a very broad distribution of synapse size , with the smallest synapses occurring at the highest frequencies .",
    "thus , detection of a synapse inevitably involves setting some minimum - size criterion for any candidate cell - cell contact specialization to qualify as a synapse . for fm , the ` size ' metric is typically the intensity of one or more fluorescent synaptic protein tags .",
    "the fact that there are clearly non - synaptic ` backgrounds , ' and that the observed size distributions are log - normal , enforces high sensitivity of synapse detection on some rather arbitrary threshold minimum size value .",
    "this sensitivity in turn makes key results of widespread interest , such as the synaptic density in a region or the presence / absence of a synapse at a given microscopic site , uncomfortably dependent on that same size threshold value .",
    "the probabilistic synapse detector proposed here may lead both to relief from such arbitrary - threshold ( parameters ) and to improvements in our biological understanding of what defines a synapse .",
    "the unsupervised probabilistic synapse detector reported here accepts molecular - morphological synapse models in the form of user queries , and delivers a volumetric map of the probability that each voxel represents part of a synapse .",
    "these maps can then be used directly to detect , classify , and map putative synapses , with confidence statistics for each .",
    "taking human annotation of cat em data as ground truth , we show that our algorithm detects synapses from muxfm data alone as effectively as human annotators ( while seeing only the muxfm data ) , and can reproduce known architectural features of cortical synapse distributions .",
    "the algorithm is actually validated with the most comprehensive at datasets currently available .",
    "though we here address only array tomography image data , our probabilistic synapse detector may also be useful for analysis of widely available confocal and super - resolution fm images .",
    "the proposed algorithm is inspired from biological knowledge of synapse characteristics .",
    "notwithstanding immense complexity and limited understanding , strong evidence suggests two major synaptic classes : excitatory and inhibitory .",
    "synapses include two major structural components : a presynaptic terminal and a postsynaptic dendrite .",
    "detecting synapses using data from immunofluorescence imaging involves identifying such adjacent presynaptic and postsynaptic antibody markers , as shown in fig [ fig : chemical_synapse ] , which diagrams the locations of four major excitatory synaptic proteins .",
    "fig [ fig : synapseoverview ] is an example of an excitatory synapse with images of presynaptic and postsynaptic antibody markers overlaid upon an em image .",
    "@xmath0 m @xmath1 @xmath0 m images showing conjugate em and if data .",
    "the left panel has synapsin ( green ) and psd-95 ( red ) data overlaid , marked by the colored boundary lines .",
    "the presence of both presynaptic and postsynaptic channels indicates the presence of a synapse with high probability .",
    "the center panel shows the psd-95 if image and the right panel shows the synapsin if image . on both images ,",
    "the em - identified synaptic cleft is marked by a blue box .",
    ", scaledwidth=100.0% ]    manual synapse identification involves determining the punctum size and brightness in one channel , and then considering adjacency to similarly - defined puncta in other channels .",
    "however , without corresponding em data , detections using only if data have an associated degree of uncertainty .",
    "thus , we propose a query - based probabilistic synapse detection method that reflects the thought process underlying expert manual synapse detection .",
    "the first step is to distinguish signal from background noise .",
    "this calculation encodes the probability that the pixel value represents authentic antigen detection .",
    "this indicates the probability that the antibody is detecting its corresponding protein antigen . the second step is to determine whether the foreground pixels correspond to a 2d punctum , since photons emanating only from a single pixel usually reflect noise .",
    "therefore , adjacent ` positive ' pixels , more likely to reflect a synaptic punctum , are augmented .",
    "third , puncta that span multiple slices have a higher probability of belonging to a synapse than those that do not . to visualize this effect ,",
    "the probability of a punctum belonging to a synapse is attenuated based on whether the prospective punctum spans multiple slices .",
    "the last step in computing the synapse probability map is to evaluate the presence of adjacent presynaptic and postsynaptic puncta by correlating the corresponding if volumes .",
    "this produces a probability map , where the value at each voxel is the probability it belongs to a synapse .",
    "this algorithm provides a general framework for the evaluation of a wide variety of synapse subtypes , user - defined by setting the presynaptic and postsynaptic antibodies and puncta size .",
    "the following sections describe in detail each step in the process , as diagrammed in fig [ fig : pipeline ] .",
    "raw immunofluorescence image data is noisy ; for example , speckles of the antibody markers often bind with cellular structures not associated with synapses , such as mitochondria . in addition , fluorescence imagery contains signal from sources other than fluorescently - labelled antibodies , e.g. from background autofluorescence .",
    "finally , all digital imagery contains inherent noise from sources such as camera read noise and photon shot noise .",
    "the noise produced by these sources is usually smaller in magnitude than that originating from authentic synaptic labeling , but it can not simply be filtered out and dismissed from consideration , since the signal may originate from a true synaptic site , and we want to allow for the possibility that a concordance of weak evidence will lead to the detection of a synapse .",
    "thus , the first step of the algorithm consists of differentiating the bright voxels , the foreground ( potential objects of interest ) , from a noisy background in a probabilistic fashion .",
    "if data volumes , when stained for synaptic markers , are also extremely sparse - approximately 2% of the voxels in the dataset belong to the foreground , as indicated in fig [ fig : thresholdhistograms ] .",
    "therefore , the if image volume can be used to approximate the distribution of the background noise .",
    "let @xmath2 be the intensity value of a voxel at position @xmath3 in slice @xmath4 , for a given channel of the if data .",
    "a probabilistic model , @xmath5 , is computed which characterizes all the pixels that belong to the background , which includes approximately 98% of the voxels .",
    "the background noise model is computed independently for each slice to account for variations in tissue and imaging properties .",
    "the background model @xmath6 is assumed to be a gaussian distribution , whose mean and variance @xmath7 are empirically computed from each slice @xmath4 ( the @xmath4 index is omitted in eq 1 for simplicity of notation ) . then , the probability of a voxel belonging to the background , i.e. not being ` bright , ' is given by @xmath8 therefore , the probability of a voxel associated with the foreground , @xmath9 , is computed as @xmath10 fig [ fig : raw_prob ] shows an example of the transformation from the raw data to the foreground probability map .",
    "% of voxels in the dataset lie below the threshold line indicated in red .",
    "the threshold lines are estimates based on visual inspection of the data.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]     pixels or @xmath11 m of the logarithm ( for visualization purposes ) of the if raw data ( left ) and the corresponding image of the foreground probability map ( right ) of one slice of the psd-95 antibody .",
    "the proposed approach clearly differentiates the high probability bright pixels from the background low probability pixels .",
    "the ` dark ' rings around the puncta are an artifact of the deconvolution performed prior to image alignment , and its spatial extend has been taken into account in the spatially - oriented next steps of the algorithm .",
    "the at data appears ` quantized ' because it has been upsampled from its native 100 nm per pixel resolution to 2.33 nm per pixel to align the at data with the em data .",
    ", scaledwidth=100.0% ]      once foreground pixels have been identified in a probabilistic fashion , the next step is to determine if they form a 2d punctum .",
    "since synapses appear as bright puncta in the if image data , voxels which form puncta should have a higher probability of being associated with a synapse than those which do not .",
    "the probability of a voxel belonging to a 2d punctum , @xmath12 , is computed by multiplying the voxel s foreground probability by that of its neighbors in a predefined neighborhood region , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the neighborhood size , defined by the smallest expected punctum size .",
    "these operations are analogous to applying a box filter on the logarithm of the probability map , for computational efficiency . in our experiments , @xmath14 was set to be slightly larger than the size of the point spread function ( psf ) of the microscopes used .",
    "fig  [ fig : prob_conv ] shows an example of the foreground probability map and the corresponding 2d puncta probability map .",
    "this step transforms each pixel s value from representing the probability it belongs to the foreground to the probability it belongs to both the foreground _ and _ to a punctum .",
    "pixels or @xmath11 m. , scaledwidth=100.0% ]      potential synaptic puncta can span multiple slices of a given channel ; puncta that span multiple slices have a higher probability of being associated with a synapse than those that do not .",
    "therefore , we propose a factor @xmath15 which diminishes the probability values associated with voxels which do not maintain a similar probability value in adjacent slices ,    @xmath16 ^ 2 \\right \\}.",

    "the number of slices compared is dependent on the input size parameter for each antibody .",
    "the factor attenuates values for 2d puncta that do not span the required number of slices , as shown in figure  [ fig : factor_result ] .",
    "the 3d puncta probability map is then computed by multiplying the 2d puncta probability map by this factor ,    @xmath19    which further improves the probability of a detection by considering the slice - to - slice spatial distribution , going from 2d to 3d .",

    "synapses are identified in if data by the close spatial arrangement of pre- and postsynaptic antibody markers , which correspond to proteins associated with synapses .",
    "therefore , the next step in our approach is to look for the presence of presynaptic puncta in the neighborhood of postsynaptic puncta .",
    "more precisely , for each postsynaptic antibody voxel ( i.e. , psd-95 ) , we search in the adjacent 3d neighborhood of the corresponding presynaptic ( i.e. , synapsin ) volume for a high intensity probability signal . to accomplish this ,",
    "a rectangular grid is defined in the presynaptic channels around each postsynaptic voxel , as shown in fig [ fig : search_grid ] .",
    "the size of the grid is defined by the initial query parameters , which depend on both the inherent biology and microscope resolution .",
    "the logarithm of the 3d puncta probability map ( eq . [ eq : p3dp ] ) is integrated in each grid location and the maximum is taken as presynaptic signal level around the given postsynaptic location , @xmath20 where the grid @xmath21 is centered at the current voxel @xmath22 and divided into @xmath23 subregions @xmath24 . to search in a grid around a defined voxel location for the presynaptic signal ,",
    "@xmath25 is set to 3 .",
    "when searching for the postsynaptic signal , @xmath25 is set to 1 since postsynaptic signals are expected to loosely co - localize .",
    "these values can be adopted to the data resolution .",
    "the postsynaptic antibody pixel probability @xmath26 is multiplied by the presynaptic probability to obtain the desired probability map :    @xmath27    again , the probability information is here maintained ( fig [ fig : silane_result ] ) , now including the morphological relationship between the channels .",
    "this ` grid ' like approach allows the method to be robust to slight image alignment and registration issues , as well as to deconvolution artifacts .",

    "the threshold can actually add flexibility , since different thresholds might lead to selective detection of different types of synapses .",
    "this possibility will be studied when new data becomes available , now that the unsupervised algorithm here introduced can be applied to such data ( previous algorithms were basically limited to making binary decisions for detecting synapses they have been trained to detect ) .",
    "this means that the only non - straightforwardly physical parameter of the proposed algorithm ( virtually all image processing algorithms have critical parameters ) can add flexibility to the technique .",
    "finally , the threshold can be ignored if we work directly with the probability map ( eq . [ eq : finaleq ] ) , e.g. , to compute ` fuzzy volumes . '",
    "this unique aspect of the proposed algorithm output will also be the subject of study when running the algorithm on new at data in the future .",
    "this work introduced a model - based unsupervised synapse detection algorithm that incorporates both fundamental biological knowledge of synapses and how they are identified by experts in the immunofluorescence data .",
    "for this purpose , we created a series of probabilistic excitatory detectors for various subtypes of synapses , and included the 3d spatial relationships typical of synaptic structures .",
    "this novel approach provides a probabilistic - based detection algorithm yielding not only detection but detection with confidence values .",
    "the implementation of synapse detection as a probability map ( i.e. , probability of each pixel belonging to a synapse ) , as opposed to a binary detection / no - detection result may provide a powerful tool to assist experts throughout the exploratory process to gain new insights from the immunofluorescence data , including potentially discovering new subtypes of synapses .",
    "the influence of different biological and at components on the actual probability values , from the noise of the system to the expression level of the proteins and the subclass of the synapses , an important new topic of investigation , will become possible when the proposed algorithm is applied to large new datasets , currently being generated .",
    "the algorithm is computationally very simple and the only parameters are the user s definition of a synapse subtype , rendering it ready for massive datasets .",
    "the results were validated with the best available cat and at data , producing state - of - the - art results without the need for supervised training .",
    "as demonstrated here , the proposed framework can be exploited for the explicit detection of synapses or their properties , the latter being critical for the discovery of new subtypes as well as the patterns of distributions of known subtypes .",
