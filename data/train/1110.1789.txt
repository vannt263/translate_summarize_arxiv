    "this metallicity range includes stars from the halo , the thick disk , the thin disk , and probably the bulge . due to their nearly constant absolute magnitude",
    ", this type of stars constitutes an ideal sample to trace various galactic populations in the galaxy .",
    "generally , the identification of rhb stars in the field is rather difficult just by their colors but some attempts to identify this type of star had been made ( rose 1985 ; tautvaisiene 1996 ; preston 2006 ) .",
    "however , these works did not produce a large sample of rhb stars ( for example , a sample with star number larger than 100 ) for statistic work . with the aid of hipparcos parallaxes , kaempf et al .",
    "( 2005 ) selected a large sample of rhb stars in the field and calculated their kinematical parameters based on available radial velocities and proper motions .",
    "they found two populations : a disk one having @xmath10 kpc and a halo one showing @xmath11 kpc .",
    "this is the only work to trace the structure of the galaxy via a large sample of rhb stars .",
    "due to the distance limitation of the hipparcos survey , these results were based on stars in the solar neighborhood , where the majority of the disk stars are from the thin disk with a minority from the thick disk and only a sprinkling of halo stars .",
    "it is of high interest to trace the disk and halo populations via rhb stars locating far away from the solar neighborhood and well above the galactic plane . for this purpose ,",
    "planned or ongoing kinematically unbiased surveys , such as the global astrometric interferometer for astrophysics ( gaia ; turon et al .",
    "2005 ) , the sdss / segue ( york et al .",
    "2000 ; yanny et al .  2009 ) , and the lamost ( zhao et al .  2006 ) projects , will provide a chance to obtain and to study a large sample of rhb stars to the distant halo .",
    "in this work , we attempt to investigate the properties of rhb stars and to carry out kinematic traces of various galactic populations using rhb stars selected from the sdss spectroscopic survey . as compared with the previous study by kaempf et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , the present work has several advantages .",
    "first of all , the sdss survey covers quite distant regions of the galaxy , and our study can be extended far away from the solar neighborhood .",
    "second , spectroscopic data of the sdss survey provide stellar parameters , radial velocities , and metallicities .",
    "this data set not only makes it possible to identify rhb candidates more easily , but also provides the most powerful tool to investigate the galactic populations by a combination of chemical and kinematical ingredients , in view of the fact that our galaxy evolves both chemically and dynamically .",
    "finally , it is expected that rhb stars selected from the sdss survey could extend to a much lower metallicity range than that of kaempf et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , which mainly concentrated on solar metallicity , and thus they will contribute much to the understanding of the thick - disk and the halo populations .",
    "rhb stars are easily seen based on the color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of gcs , and statistically it is possible to pick out this type of star in the field of the solar neighborhood with the aid of hipparcos parallaxes . without previously - known distance information for stars",
    "far from the solar neighborhood , the selection of rhb stars in the field is rather difficult .",
    "but the problem of identification is much easier if the metallicity of the star is known , as shown in straizys et al .",
    ". based on high resolution and high signal - to - noise ratio spectra , around 30 rhb stars have been identified in the literature ( e.g. , behr et al .  2003 ; carney et al .  2003 , 2008 ) .",
    "in order to enlarge this sample , rhb stars have been identified from the sdss low resolution ( r @xmath12 1800 ) spectroscopic survey . the sdss data release 7 ( dr7 ; abazajian et al .",
    "2009 ) provides photometry and spectroscopic metallicities for a large sample of high - latitude stars , allowing the identification of a large sample of rhb stars in the field .      as noticed in chen et al .",

    "finally , an upper cutoff at @xmath19 is necessary because the proper motions from the usno survey become seriously contaminated by misidentifications toward faint magnitudes according to fuchs et al .",
    "but the effective cutoff in magnitude of our final sample is around @xmath20 and the saturation flag in the sdss - dr7 catalog is used to avoid stars whose magnitudes suffer from saturation effects . with these criteria , we obtain our preliminary sample of @xmath21 stars .      using the above @xmath13@xmath0}}$ ] relation , blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) and",
    "rr lyrae stars are excluded at the bluer colors , and red giant branch stars at the red limit , for a given metallicity .",

    "in the cmd of the clusters in chen et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , at a given metallicity , rhb stars have brighter absolute magnitudes than those of ms / to / sgb stars despite their similar colors , and the separation between rhb and ms / to / sgb stars in absolute magnitude at a given color becomes larger as the metallicity decreases . in view of this ,",
    "stellar parameters , i.e. , temperature , gravity and metallicity , taken from the sdss - dr7 catalog , can be used to identify rhb stars .",

    "the errors in spatial velocity come from the uncertainties of radial velocity , proper motion and distance .",

    "although the total error in spatial velocity is quite large , the data still represent usable measurements for a large sample because the systematic errors are much smaller ( @xmath1210 @xmath33 at a distance of 7 kpc ) according to ivezic et al .",
