    "the new double - image quasar presented in this paper is the first to result from a program that three of us ( j.n.w .",
    ", j.n.h . , and p.l.s . ) began to find new radio - loud gravitational lenses in the southern sky .",
    "our main goal is to find suitable lenses for time - delay measurements .",
    "the time delays between the flux variations of the multiple images of a gravitationally lensed quasar can be used as a `` one - step '' measurement of the hubble constant @xmath6 @xcite or , more precisely , a combination of angular - diameter distances between the earth , lens galaxy , and quasar ( for recent reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the measured lensing rate in a well - defined sample of extragalactic sources places interesting limits on the cosmological constant ( @xcite ) .    our search methodology will be described in a future paper ; we confine ourselves here to a summary .",
    "we selected southern sources because the southern hemisphere is relatively unexplored for lenses and therefore more likely to contain bright and useful specimens .",
    "the southern limit is @xmath7 to permit the use of the nrao very large array ( vla ) and very long baseline array ( vlba ) , instruments that facilitate the search .",
    "we selected only sources with flat spectral indices ( @xmath8 , where @xmath9 ) as measured between the 4.85  ghz parkes - mit - nrao catalog @xcite and the 1.4  ghz nrao vla sky survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "flat - spectrum sources tend to be core - dominated , and therefore variable ( a prerequisite for measuring time delays ) , easily recognized when lensed , and easily mapped by an automatic procedure . in this respect",
    "our program is similar to the cosmic lens all - sky survey ( class ; @xcite ) , a program that ( after including the sample of the jodrell - vla astrometric survey , jvas ) has identified at least 15 new lenses among 15000 northern - hemisphere radio sources .",
    "we observed each object for 30 seconds at 8.46  ghz with the vla in its a configuration .",
    "objects exhibiting multiple compact components ( about 5% of the sample ) were selected as lens candidates and scheduled for appropriate follow - up observations , including multifrequency vla imaging , vlba imaging , and optical imaging .",
    "the goal of the follow - up observations is to determine whether the components have similar spectral properties and surface brightnesses ( as lensed images should ) and to search for a lens galaxy .    for the particular case of pmn  j18383427 ,",
    "the chronology of observations was as follows .",
    "the initial vla image from 1998 may 19 contained two compact components separated by @xmath0 . the most likely explanation for this morphology was a core - jet or core - hotspot structure",
    "however , in ground - based images obtained during 1999 april 10 - 15 , the optical counterpart was revealed to be a double with the same separation and position angle as the radio double , thereby suggesting pmn  j18383427  was either a binary quasar or a gravitational lens .    on 1999 july 19 , multifrequency observations with the vla revealed that the spectral indices of the components were the same .",
    "this evidence favored the gravitational lens hypothesis , since lensing is achromatic .",
    "we used the vlba on 1999 october 11 to search for matching milliarcsecond substructure within the radio components , which is characteristic ( although not required ) of lensed images .",
    "both components were detected , but no matching substructure was seen .",
    "on the strength of the evidence thus far , pmn  j18383427  was included in the cfa - arizona space telescope lens survey ( castles ) , an effort by seven of us ( e.e.f .",
    ", c.s.k . , j.l .",
    ", b.a.m . , and h .- w.r . ) to use the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) to observe all the known galaxy - scale gravitational lenses .",
    "the hst / wfpc2 image , obtained on 2000 march 1 , revealed a diffuse light source between the quasar components which is naturally interpreted as a lens galaxy .",
    "this left no doubt that pmn  j18383427  is a gravitationally lensed quasar .",
    "we obtained optical spectra of the quasar and lens galaxy with the eso 3.6 m telescope at la silla on 2000 march 4 .",
    "this allowed us to measure the source redshift @xmath3 but our lens galaxy spectrum was inconclusive .",
    "finally , in order to assess the radio variability of pmn  j18383427  we measured its total flux at two frequencies with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) on 2000 april 5 .",
    "subsequent sections of this paper present these observations in logical rather than chronological order",
    ". sections  [ sec : vla ] through  [ sec : atca ] present the radio properties of the system , as revealed by measurements with the vla , vlba , and atca .",
    "sections  [ sec : hst ] and  [ sec : lco ] present space-  and ground - based optical images , and   [ sec : spectra ] presents optical spectra of the quasar and lens galaxy .",
    "we consider simple models of the lens potential in ",
    "[ sec : model ] .",
    "finally , in the last section we review the evidence that pmn  j18383427  is a gravitationally lensed quasar and discuss the prospects for measuring and interpreting the time delay between its lensed images .",
    "the date , frequency , resolution , and sensitivity of the vla observations are listed in the first four rows of table  [ tbl : vla ] . in all cases",
    "the vla was in its a configuration and the total observing bandwidth was 100 mhz .",
    "radio source 3c286 was used to set the absolute flux scale , following the procedures suggested in the vla calibrator manual and adopting flux densities 7.49 , 5.52 , and 3.42 jy at 4.86 , 8.46 , and 14.94  ghz respectively .",
    "calibration was performed with standard procedures in aips .",
    "deconvolution and imaging were performed with difmap @xcite .",
    "this included phase - only self - calibration with a 30-second solution interval .",
    "the final images , created with uniform weighting and an elliptical gaussian restoring beam , are shown in figure  [ fig : vla ] .    in each image",
    "there are two components . throughout this paper",
    "we refer to the northern component of pmn  j18383427  as a , and the southern component as b. to measure the separation and flux density ratio of a and b , we fit a two - component model to the self - calibrated visibilities using the `` modelfit '' utility of difmap . after subtracting the best - fit model from the data ,",
    "the residual images were all consistent with thermal noise .",
    "the best - fit parameters are listed in table  [ tbl : vla ] .",
    "the flux density ratios are in rough agreement but are not equal within the quoted uncertainties . for a gravitational lens",
    "the ratios are expected to be approximately equal , but one reason to expect small discrepancies is variability of the background object ( see   [ sec : summary ] for further discussion ) .",
    "two - point spectral indices were computed for each component based on the 1999 july 19 observations .",
    "the results are listed in table  [ tbl : indices ] .",
    "both components are verified to have flat radio spectra .",
    "the coordinates of component a , based on the 1999  july  19 images , are r.a .",

    "( j2000 )  @xmath11 , within @xmath12 .",
    "we observed pmn  j18383427  for 4 hours with the vlba on 1999 october 11 .",
    "croix and brewster antennas were unavailable .",
    "the observing bandwidth was 48 mhz , divided into 8  ifs , with an average frequency of 4.975  ghz .",
    "the visibility averaging time was 1 second .",
    "this level of spectral and time sampling was sufficient to prevent significant bandwidth- and time - average smearing over the required field of view .",
    "calibration was performed with standard procedures in aips .",
    "fringe fitting for sources with widely spaced components is problematic without a prior model of the source , because the source structure causes rapid time variation of the solutions .",
    "for this reason we used a two - step procedure .",
    "first , the data were fringe - fitted using a point source model and a 30-second solution interval .",
    "this allowed a preliminary image to be made , in which components a and b were both detected .",
    "then , the calibration was redone by fringe - fitting with reference to a two - component model based on the preliminary image and a 3-minute solution interval .",
    "the final images were created with difmap , after repeated iterations of model fitting and phase - only self - calibration .",
    "the final uniformly - weighted images are shown in figure  [ fig : vlba ] .",
    "both a wide - field map and close - ups of each component are displayed .",
    "component b is unresolved .",
    "component a is partially resolved ; in addition to an unresolved component there is extended emission to the west , comprising about 10% of the total flux density .    a model for the surface brightness distribution",
    "was constructed with difmap , by fitting a circular gaussian to each compact component ( which we continue to identify as a and b ) , and then using the clean algorithm to account for the diffuse emission west of a with a large number of point sources . during the subsequent iterations of model - fitting and self - calibration , the clean components were kept fixed and the circular gaussian parameters were varied .",
    "the best - fit positions and flux densities of a and b are reported in the last entry of table  [ tbl : vla ] .",
    "the separation between the gaussian components is 996.1 mas and the position angle is @xmath13 east of north .",
    "the total flux density of the diffuse emission is 16.7 mjy .",
    "the flux density of b is the same in the vlba and vla images , but the flux density of a is 27% smaller in the vlba image . as a result",
    "the vlba flux density ratio ( 10.6 ) is smaller than the vla ratios ( which average 14.6 ) .",
    "even when the total flux density of the diffuse emission west of a is added to that of a , the vlba ratio is only 11.8 .",
    "one possible explanation is that the vla image of a includes relatively diffuse flux that is missing from the vlba image .",
    "the shortest vlba baseline ( 236 km , or 4 m@xmath14 ) is longer than the longest vla baseline ( 35 km , or 0.6  m@xmath14 ) , so there is a range of spatial frequencies that are unresolved by the vla and invisible to the vlba .",
    "another possibility to explain part or all of the discrepancy is that the source varied between observing epochs . due to the time delay between components ,",
    "source variability would cause fluctuations in the instantaneous flux density ratio .",
    "since pmn  j18383427  is a gravitational lens , there should be radio emission east of b corresponding to the emission west of a. however , given the peak brightness of the emission west of a ( 2.5 mjy / beam ) and the magnification ratio described above , one would expect the brightness of such emission to be at most 0.24 mjy / beam , which is not much higher than the rms level of 0.18 mjy / beam .",
    "confirmation of matching milliarcsecond substructure will require deeper imaging .",
    "to test for variability we examined pmn  j18383427  with the australia compact telescope array ( atca ) on 2000 april 5 , observing simultaneously at 4.80 and 8.64  ghz while the array was in the 6d configuration .",
    "the observation was divided into three scans of one minute each , with 2 hours between scans to improve the @xmath15-coverage .",
    "calibration was performed with the software package miriad , and imaging with difmap .",
    "the absolute flux density scale was set by observations of pks  b1934638 , which is believed to match the 3c286-based flux scale within  3% .",
    "the antenna spacings were not large enough to resolve the components , so we used the vla models to fix the separation of the two components and varied their flux densities to achieve the best fit to the atca data .",
    "since the individual flux densities are covariant we report only their sum in table  [ tbl : fluxes ] .",
    "the uncertainty was estimated as the quadrature sum of the range in total flux obtained by analyzing each one - minute scan separately , and a 3% uncertainty due to absolute flux calibration .",
    "table  [ tbl : fluxes ] also lists other flux density measurements reported in this paper and in various published radio catalogs .",
    "the total atca flux density at 4.80  ghz was the same as the most recent 4.86  ghz vla measurement .",
    "however , the total flux density at 8.64  ghz was 44% higher than the most recent 8.46  ghz vla measurement , indicating strong variability .",
    "( the expected difference due to spectral index alone is 0.6% , and the combined measurement uncertainty is 5% . ) variability at 8.46  ghz is corroborated by the 12% variation in total flux density observed between the two vla measurements .",
    "on 2000 march 1 , three dithered exposures ( 700 sec , 700 sec , 600 sec ) of pmn  j18383427  were acquired during one hst orbit , using the wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) and the f814w filter .",
    "the data were reduced with the standard castles pipeline : the exposures were registered , weighted by exposure time , and combined using a 3-sigma `` ccdclip '' rejection algorithm .",
    "( see @xcite for other examples of two - image lenses observed in the castles program . )",
    "the upper left panel of figure  [ fig : hst ] is a 3@xmath16 3  subraster of the final image .",
    "components a and b are present with the same separation and position angle as the corresponding radio components .",
    "crucially , the southern component is not compact .",
    "there is diffuse emission extending northward from b towards a , which is labeled g. the natural interpretation is that g is a lens galaxy : it lies along the line joining a and b , and its position near b is consistent with the large flux density ratio between a and b ( see   [ sec : model ] for simple models ) .",
    "in addition , there is a third compact object @xmath17 southeast of a , labeled s. object s is almost certainly not a third image of the background quasar , because it is silent in all our radio images . in particular , the 4.86  ghz image of 1999",
    "july 19 requires s to be at least 200 times dimmer than a , whereas in the optical image it is about 8 times dimmer .",
    "missing optical images can be plausibly explained by dust extinction ( e.g.  b1152 + 199 ; @xcite ) but missing radio images defy simple explanation .",
    "the low galactic latitude ( @xmath18 ) of the field suggests that s is a foreground star . to estimate the _ a posteriori _ probability of a star intruding on the lens",
    ", we estimated the local mean density of stars by counting all the stars in the pc field ( 32@xmath16 32 ) that are at least as bright as s. based on this mean density , the probability that at least one star would appear within @xmath19 of component a , component b , or the line joining them , is 5% .",
    "this is somewhat low but within reason .    to measure the relative positions and magnitudes of a , b , g , and s , we created parameterized models of the image using a twice - oversampled psf created by tinytim v4.4 @xcite .",
    "the models were fit to the data using the procedures of @xcite .",
    "the first model contained three point sources ( representing a , b , and s ) and a circular de vaucouleurs profile ( g ) .",
    "the residual image contained a diffuse pattern of residuals centered on component a with an integrated flux equal to 12% of the combined flux of a and s , suggesting that a is not adequately modeled by a point source .",
    "possibly , the host galaxy of the background quasar and/or additional foreground objects are contributing light .",
    "we tried accounting for this extra light with additional model components , such as a circular de vaucouleurs profile , an elliptical de vaucouleurs profile , and extra point sources .",
    "there is no compelling reason to recommend one of these models over the others , but we judged that the residuals appeared most random for a model with two extra point sources .",
    "we refer to these two extra point sources as p and q. the best - fit parameters of the model are listed in table  [ tbl : hst ] .",
    "parameter uncertainties were estimated in the same manner as @xcite : three terms were added in quadrature , representing the statistical error in the fit , the range in parameters obtained with different choices of the model psf , and the range obtained with two different modeling programs .",
    "the upper right panel of figure  [ fig : hst ] shows the image after components a , b and s of the best - fit model have been subtracted .",
    "this allows the lens galaxy g and the excess residuals near a to be seen clearly . in the lower left panel ,",
    "only g has been subtracted , highlighting component b. it is worth noting that the a / b flux ratio in this image ( 27:1 ) is much higher than any of the radio flux density ratios .",
    "this is probably due to the proximity of b and g. optical extinction due to the lens galaxy should be greater for component b than for a.    in the lower right panel the entire model ( including p and q ) has been subtracted .",
    "there are still residuals near a , extending in both directions nearly perpendicular to the a / b separation .",
    "the elongation of the residuals is suggestive of tangentially - stretched emission from a host galaxy .",
    "deeper hst or adaptive - optics imaging in the infrared will be useful to clarify the nature of the putative host galaxy .    to connect the wfpc2 photometry to the johnson - kron - cousins system we approximated f814w @xmath20 and adopted a zero - point magnitude of 21.69 , as did @xcite .",
    "this zero - point is based on the calibration of @xcite , but with a gain of 7 and a correction of 0.1 mag for finite aperture .",
    "the resulting magnitude of component a is @xmath21 , and the total magnitude of all components is @xmath22 , with a scatter of 0.05 between different models and an additional uncertainty of at least 0.05 due to the choice of zero - point magnitude .",
    "during 1999 april 10 - 14 we obtained @xmath1 images of pmn  j18383427  with the du  pont  2.5 m telescope at las campanas observatory ( lco ) .",
    "we used the site#3 @xmath23 ccd camera , with gain 2.5 e@xmath24/d.n .  and read noise 6.6 e@xmath24 .",
    "table  [ tbl : lco ] is a journal of these observations .",
    "the images were bias - subtracted and flat - fielded with standard iraf procedures .",
    "the rotation and pixel scale ( @xmath25 ) of each image were derived using at least 30 stars from the usno - a2.0 catalog @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : field ] shows the @xmath26 @xmath27-band field .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : lco ] is an @xmath28 subraster centered on pmn  j18383427 .",
    "photometry was performed with the daophot package in iraf .",
    "first , we constructed an empirical psf using the signal - weighted average of the images of 12 well - exposed , widely - spaced stars in the field .",
    "these reference stars are circled and labeled in figure  [ fig : field ] . due to the crowded condition of the field ,",
    "the psf diameter was limited to @xmath29 .",
    "next , we used this psf template to fit simultaneously for the positions and magnitudes of all 12 reference stars , all the components representing pmn  j18383427 , and all the neighbors of the reference stars and pmn  j18383427  within @xmath29 .    for the @xmath27 and @xmath30 images the model of pmn  j18383427  consisted of four point sources representing a , b , g , and s.",
    "their relative positions were fixed at the values measured in the hst image . for the @xmath31 images , which had poorer seeing and a smaller signal , the covariance between a and s and between b and g prevented convergence .",
    "for these we used a model consisting of two components with the same relative separation as a and b in the hst image .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : lco ] shows the @xmath27-band image at high contrast after subtraction of the best - fit model .",
    "the neighboring stars to the southeast and east were also subtracted .",
    "a pattern of positive residuals between a and b at the @xmath32 level may be unmodeled light from g. in all other images the residuals were consistent with noise .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes of the reference stars and components of pmn  j18383427 , relative to reference star # 8 , are listed in table  [ tbl : photometry ] .",
    "the quoted uncertainty in each magnitude difference is the statistical error in the fit .",
    "for a few stars in the @xmath30 and @xmath31 images the uncertainty was increased to encompass the difference between fits to the two different exposures .",
    "we emphasize that the magnitudes of a and s are covariant , as are those of b and g. components a and s were typically separated by just one - third of the seeing disc and b and g by only one - tenth .",
    "for this reason , the combined magnitudes of a+s and of b+g are also listed in table  [ tbl : photometry ] .",
    "we connected the instrumental magnitudes to the johnson - kron - cousins photometric system by observing at least one of the standard fields described by @xcite each night .",
    "six stars in the field sa110 - 499 were used to calibrate the @xmath31 and @xmath30 magnitude scales , using the @xmath33 index to compute color terms .",
    "four stars in pg0918 + 029 and three stars in pg1323086 were used to calibrate the @xmath27 magnitude scale , using the @xmath34 index to compute color terms . in all cases",
    "the aperture diameter was @xmath35 .",
    "we adopted `` typical '' las campanas extinction coefficients of @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "the calibrated magnitudes of reference star # 8 are printed beneath table  [ tbl : photometry ] .",
    "the quoted uncertainty is the quadrature sum of the uncertainty in the instrumental magnitude and the rms scatter in the calibration solution . with this calibration , the total apparent magnitudes of all model components ( a , b , s , and g ) during 1999 april 10 - 14 were @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , within 0.04  mag .",
    "the total @xmath27 magnitude disagrees with the value derived from the hst / wfpc2 image ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "more significantly , the lco image exhibits a much larger contrast between northern ( a+s ) and southern ( b+g ) components . in the lco image",
    "the flux ratio ( a+s)/(b+g ) is @xmath43 , whereas the wfpc2 value is @xmath44 .",
    "these discrepancies are possibly the result of variability of the source quasar . however , the significance of these discrepancies is unclear , since the results were derived from different instruments and photometric models .",
    "repeated ground - based measurements will be important in assessing variability , using table  [ tbl : photometry ] as a baseline .",
    "optical spectra of the quasar and lens galaxy were obtained with the 3.6 m telescope of the european southern observatory ( eso ) at la silla , chile .",
    "we used the eso faint object spectrograph and camera ( efosc ) with ccd # 40 ( @xmath45 , gain 1.3 e@xmath24/d.n . , readout noise 7.5 e@xmath24 ) and grism # 6 ( 3860 - 8070 , 30  gr / mm ) giving a plate scale of 2  per pixel .",
    "we obtained two separate spectra , one in which the slit was centered on quasar component a and one centered on the lens galaxy g. in both cases the slit was @xmath46 wide and oriented east - west in order to isolate the components as much as possible .",
    "the quasar spectrum is shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "it was obtained on 2000 march 4 in a 30-minute exposure in @xmath47 seeing , through an airmass of 1.5 and has a resolution of 10 .",
    "no attempt was made to correct for differential atmospheric refraction .",
    "three broad emission lines are obvious , corresponding to ly@xmath4 ( 1216 ) , + ( 1400 ) , and ( 1549 ) at a redshift of @xmath48 .",
    "this redshift was determined with reference to the + and lines only , since the broad absorption trough blueward of ly-@xmath4 makes centroid estimation difficult .",
    "once this redshift was established , a probable emission line of ] ( 1909 ) was identified .",
    "at least two significant non - terrestrial absorption lines are also present in the spectrum ( 4890  and 5000 ) , but we are unable to assign them confidently to systems at particular redshifts .",
    "we did not identify any @xmath49 stellar absorption lines in this spectrum , which would have confirmed the hypothesis of   [ sec : hst ] that component s is a foreground galactic star .",
    "this is not surprising , because the a / s flux ratio is 8.1 in the hst image while the signal - to - noise ratio of each resolution element is only 7.5 .",
    "the lens galaxy spectrum , shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : spectra ] , was obtained on 2000 march 6 with a 60-minute exposure through an average airmass of 1.5 in 13 seeing .",
    "the resolution has been degraded to 30  by combining wavelength bins , in order to boost the signal - to - noise .",
    "the slit also admitted the southern quasar component b , but based on the hst photometric model ( table  [ tbl : hst ] ) the light from g was expected to dominate b.    there is only one definite feature , an emission line at 6560  with a s /",
    "n of about 3 .",
    "this feature does not appear in the quasar spectrum , which has been scaled to the level expected from the b component and plotted as a dotted line in figure  [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "although the wavelength of this feature is suspiciously close to @xmath49 h@xmath4 , suggesting it might result from imperfect background subtraction , there were several brighter sky lines that were subtracted successfully .",
    "it is therefore tempting to identify this feature with emission from the lens galaxy .    with one line of unknown origin ,",
    "redshift determination is impossible .",
    "however , it is possible to estimate the lens galaxy redshift from photometry alone , by requiring the photometric properties to be consistent with the passively - evolving fundamental plane ( fp ) of early - type galaxies .",
    "@xcite described the fp method and applied it to 17 lenses with known spectroscopic redshifts , finding a scatter of 0.11 between the fp and spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "applied to pmn  j18383427 , the lens galaxy redshift estimate is @xmath50 . given this redshift estimate ,",
    "one plausible identification for the emission at 6560  is [ ] ( 5007 ) at @xmath51 .",
    "the emission line appears to be resolved , which could be a result of blending with [ ] ( 4959 ) and/or h@xmath52 ( 4861 ) . in this case",
    "one would expect to see these lines in a deeper spectrum , along with [ ] ( 3727 ) at 4882 .",
    "a redder spectrum would reveal h@xmath4 ( 6563 ) at 8598 .",
    "obviously there are many other possibilities , if the lens redshift is not correctly predicted by the fp method . nevertheless , for the purpose of lens modeling (   [ sec : model ] )",
    "we adopt @xmath53 as a working hypothesis .",
    "the present observations of pmn  j18383427  provide only five useful constraints on the lens potential : the positions of b and g relative to a in the hst / wfpc2 image ( table  [ tbl : hst ] ) and the a / b radio flux density ratios ( table  [ tbl : vla ] ) .",
    "the optical magnitude differences are not useful because they are affected by dust extinction , reddening and possibly microlensing in the lens galaxy .",
    "any additional lensed images must be dimmer than a by a factor of at least 200 , based on the radio images .",
    "we therefore confine ourselves to simple two - image models .",
    "our first purpose is to confirm that lensing is a natural explanation for the observed image configuration . for this purpose",
    "we consider the simplest plausible model for the dark - matter halo of a galaxy , an isothermal sphere .",
    "this model produces two images with a magnification ratio equal to the ratio of their distances from the lens center . the lens galaxy center in the hst / wfpc2 image",
    "is displaced 8 mas east of the line joining a and b ( see table  [ tbl : hst ] ) ; this is within the positional uncertainty , so an isothermal sphere is a viable model .    the image separations in table  [ tbl : hst ] imply a magnification ratio of @xmath54 .",
    "this compares well with the radio flux density ratios in table  [ tbl : vla ] , although it is only in actual agreement with the vlba ratio .",
    "there is a good reason why one might expect the vlba flux density ratio to correspond more closely to the magnification ratio : it may exclude relatively diffuse flux that is lumped into component a in the vla images ( see   [ sec : vlba ] ) .",
    "another possible explanation for the small but significant discrepancies is source variability .",
    "the proper comparison to the magnification ratio is not the instantaneous flux density ratio , but rather the ratio of light curves that have been shifted by the appropriate time delay .",
    "our second purpose is to model the system in the same manner as other two - image lenses observed in the castles program @xcite , for the sake of uniformity and to provide the starting point for more detailed models .",
    "although the rough agreement with the isothermal sphere model is encouraging , it would be naive to conclude that it is an adequate model for the lens potential .",
    "numerous studies have shown that , while an isothermal sphere provides a good first approximation , extra terms representing internal or external shear must be added at the 10 - 20% level to match all the observational constraints @xcite .",
    "we therefore consider a singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) , in which the surface mass density is ( in units of the critical surface density for lensing ) , @xmath55^{-1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the axis ratio and @xmath57 sets the mass scale .",
    "there are five parameters ( @xmath57 and @xmath56 as above , and three implied parameters for the position angle of the axes and the source coordinates ) .",
    "since there are also five constraints , the parameters are determined uniquely .",
    "we chose the mean of the radio flux density ratios listed in table  [ tbl : vla ] as the constraint on the magnification ratio , with the caveats discussed above .",
    "we determined parameter uncertainties by surveying the range of parameters for which @xmath58 .",
    "the results are listed in table  [ tbl : lensmodel ] .",
    "we used this model to predict the quantity @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the time delay and @xmath61  km / s / mpc .",
    "the prediction depends on the lens galaxy redshift , the cosmological parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 , and the clumpiness of matter on cosmological scales . for the lens galaxy redshift",
    "we adopt the fp estimate @xmath53 ( see   [ sec : spectra ] ) . under the further assumptions @xmath64 and @xmath65 , and using the filled - beam approximation , @xmath66 days . if instead @xmath67 and @xmath68 then @xmath69 days .",
    "the quoted uncertainties are based on the sie model only , and are therefore underestimates ; many authors have shown that a wider class of lens models needs to be explored to obtain realistic error estimates ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "we now summarize the argument that pmn  j18383427  is a gravitational lens .",
    "it consists of two flat - spectrum radio components , each of which is compact on milliarcsecond scales and has a stellar optical counterpart .",
    "this implies both components are quasars , and indeed the bright component is a spectroscopically verified @xmath3 quasar .",
    "radio - loud quasars are scarce enough that when two of them are observed within @xmath70 , they are probably either a physical binary or a pair of lensed images . that the spectral indices of each component are the same suggests lensing is the explanation . a high - resolution optical image shows diffuse emission ( the lens galaxy ) along the line between the components",
    "the image configuration is consistent with the simplest plausible mass distribution for the lens galaxy .",
    "will this new lens be useful in the enterprise of using time delays to constrain cosmological parameters and/or aspects of galaxy structure ?",
    "the answer depends on whether the time delay of pmn  j18383427  can be measured and whether more constraints on the potential of the lens galaxy are likely to be discovered .    as for the first issue , measuring the time delay , prospects are good .",
    "there are several indications that pmn  j18383427  is variable at radio wavelengths .",
    "its spectral index is flat and the components are compact on milliarcsecond scales , both of which are indicators of variability . in addition , the three measurements of total flux density at 8.5  ghz listed in table  [ tbl : fluxes ] ( two from the vla and one from atca ) are all significantly different . at optical wavelengths",
    "we do not have as much information to judge variability .",
    "the discrepancy between the ground - based ( lco ) @xmath27-band photometry and the wfpc2 photometry ( see   [ sec : lco ] ) is one suggestion of variability , but further monitoring is required . the local reference system established in   [ sec : lco ] and table  [ tbl : photometry ] will be of use in future measurements .    the second issue , constraining the lens potential , is the greater challenge .",
    "at least the lens appears to be a single galaxy , and the lens position and magnification ratio are consistent with the simplest plausible models , giving pmn  j18383427  an advantage over more obviously complicated lenses with measured time delays , such as q0957 + 561 and class  b1608 + 656 .",
    "the challenge will be to obtain enough constraints to explore a wider class of models .",
    "deeper or higher - resolution vlbi observations may reveal corresponding substructure in the lensed images .",
    "infrared images from space or with adaptive optics will improve estimates for the lens galaxy s position and shape .",
    "they would also clarify the nature of the host galaxy that was tentatively identified in ",
    "[ sec : hst ] , which could provide very important model constraints @xcite .",
    "obtaining the lens galaxy redshift is also a priority .",
    "if these observational challenges can be met , pmn  j18383427  will contribute to the growing field of using lensing phenomena to study galaxy structure and cosmology .",
    "we are grateful to alok patnaik and andr fletcher for their help with the lens search .",
