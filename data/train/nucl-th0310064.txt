    "zero - range two - body interaction provides an important limiting case which qualitatively reflects the characteristic properties of nuclear and atomic few - body systems . in the nonrelativistic three - body system it results in the thomas collapse @xcite .",
    "the latter means that the three - body binding energy tends to @xmath9 , when the interaction radius tends to zero .",
    "when the binding energy or the exchanged particle mass is not negligible in comparison to the constituent masses , the nonrelativistic treatment becomes invalid and must be replaced by a relativistic one .",
    "two - body calculations show that in the scalar case , relativistic effects are repulsive ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "relativistic three - body calculations with zero - range interaction have been performed in a minimal relativistic model @xcite and in the framework of the light - front dynamics @xcite .",
    "it was concluded that , due to relativistic repulsion , the three - body binding energy remains finite and the thomas collapse is consequently avoided .",
    "however , in these works a cutoff was implicitly introduced . because of that , it was not clear , to what degree the finite binding energy results from the relativistic repulsion , and to what degree  from the cutoff .",
    "the latter can be imposed by many ways and it is evident in advance that one can always find an enough strong cutoff making the binding energy finite .",
    "therefore we are interested in a net effect of relativistic zero range interaction , without any cutoff .",
    "we present here our solution @xcite of the problem of three equal mass ( @xmath6 ) bosons interacting via zero - range forces .",
    "in addition , we consider also the three - fermion system .",
    "we show that the existence of the three - body system depends on the strength two - body interaction . for strong enough interaction , instead of the thomas collapse its relativistic counterpart takes place .",
    "namely , when the two - body bound state mass @xmath2 decreases , the mass @xmath1 of the three - body system decreases as well and vanishes at some critical value of @xmath10 ( @xmath4 for three bosons and @xmath5 for three fermions ) . for @xmath11 there are no solutions with real value of @xmath1 , what means  from physical point of view  that the three - body system no longer exists .",
    "we use the explicitly covariant formulation of the light - front dynamics ( see for a review @xcite ) . the wave function is defined on the light - front plane given by the equation @xmath12{$\\cdot$}}x=0 $ ] , where @xmath13 is a four - vector with @xmath14 , determining the light - front orientation . in the particular case",
    "@xmath15 we recover the standard approach .",
    "the three - body equation we consider is written for the vertex function @xmath16 , related to the wave function @xmath17 : @xmath18 where @xmath1 is the three - body bound state mass .",
    "the faddeev amplitudes @xmath19 are introduced in the standard way : @xmath20 and one obtains a system of three coupled equations for them . with",
    "the symmetry relations @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the system is reduced to a single equation for one of the amplitudes , say @xmath23 .    for zero - range forces , the interaction kernel in momentum space",
    "is replaced by a constant @xmath24 .",
    "this is precise meaning of the relativistic zero - range interaction . for a given two - body bound state mass @xmath2",
    "the constant @xmath24 is expressed through @xmath2 and disappears from the problem .",
    "equation for @xmath23 can be rewritten in variables @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) , where @xmath27 is the spatial component of the four - vector @xmath28 orthogonal to @xmath29 and @xmath30{$\\cdot$}}k_i\\over\\omega{\\makebox[0.08cm]{$\\cdot$}}p}$ ] @xcite . in general , @xmath23 depends on all variables ( @xmath31 ) , constrained by the relations @xmath32 , @xmath33 , but for contact kernel it depends only on @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the equation for the faddeev amplitude reads : @xmath35    the factor @xmath36 is the two - body off - shell scattering amplitude .",
    "it corresponds to the fixed two - body bound state mass @xmath2 and depends on the off - shell two - body effective mass @xmath37 . for @xmath38",
    "the calculation gives : @xmath39 where @xmath40 and similarly for @xmath41 . if @xmath42 , the amplitude obtains the form : @xmath43 where @xmath44 it has the pole at @xmath45 .",
    "the two - body mass squared @xmath46 is expressed through the three - body variables as : @xmath47 the three - body mass @xmath1 enters the equation ( [ eq1 ] ) through @xmath46 .",
    "the arguments of @xmath23 run the values @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "the variable @xmath46 becomes negative at @xmath50 ( the square is understood in the sense of minkowsky metric ) . by a replacement of variables the equation ( [ eq1 ] ) can be transformed to the form of equation ( 11 ) from @xcite except for the integration limits . in the papers @xcite the variable @xmath46",
    "was constrained by positive values , that strongly restricts the domain of variables @xmath51 and , in this way , introduces a cutoff .",
    "being interested in studying the zero - range interaction , we do not cut the variation domain of variables @xmath51 .",
    "as we will see , this point turns out to be crucial for the appearance of the relativistic collapse .",
    "the zero - range two - fermion kernel can be constructed using many different spin couplings .",
    "our main interest is the influence of the antisymmetrization of the wave function which should be taken into account for any kernel .",
    "therefore we solve the problem for a simplified kernel : @xmath52 where we denote : @xmath53{$\\cdot$}}(k_1+k_2 ) } \\left[\\bar{u}_{\\sigma_1}(k_1)i\\hat{\\omega } \\gamma_5u_c \\bar{u}_{\\sigma_2}(k_2 ) \\right]\\ ] ] and @xmath54 the matrix @xmath55 appears in the contact interaction of fermions @xcite .",
    "this kernel is factorized relative to initial and final states .",
    "the divergence of two - body scattering amplitude ( at fixed @xmath24 ) is logarithmic . at fixed value of the two - body mass @xmath2",
    "the amplitude becomes finite , like in the boson case .",
    "in nonrelativistic limit , kernel ( [ eq4d ] ) corresponds to interaction in the @xmath56 state only .",
    "the equation for the faddeev component is generalized for the three - fermion case by adding the spin indices .",
    "its solution has the form : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is defined in ( [ eq4b1 ] ) .",
    "it is antisymmetric relative to permutation @xmath59 , whereas the sum of three faddeev components is antisymmetric relative to permutation of any pair .",
    "the @xmath60-matrix @xmath61 can be decomposed as : @xmath62 with the basis matrices @xmath63{$\\cdot$}}p}\\right ] , \\quad s_2=m\\frac{\\hat{\\omega}}{\\omega{\\makebox[0.08cm]{$\\cdot$}}p}.\\ ] ] we get system of two equations for the scalar functions @xmath64 .",
    "one of the equations contains only @xmath65 and namely it determines the three - fermion bound state mass @xmath1 .",
    "the results of solving equation ( [ eq1 ] ) for three bosons and corresponding equation for three fermions are presented in what follows .",
    "calculations were carried out with constituent mass @xmath66 and correspond to the ground state .",
    "we represent in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the three - body bound state mass @xmath1 as a function of the two - body one @xmath2 ( solid line ) together with the dissociation limit @xmath67 .     versus the two - body one @xmath0 ( solid line ) .",

    "dots values are taken from @xcite.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    our results corresponding to integration limits @xcite are included in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( dash line ) for comparison .",
    "values from @xcite ( corrected relative to @xcite ) are indicated by dots . in both cases the three - body binding energy is finite and the thomas collaps is absent , like it was already found in @xcite . however , except for the zero binding limit , solid and dash curves strongly differ from each other . in the two - body zero",
    "binding limit , the three - boson binding energy ( solid line ) is @xmath68 .     versus @xmath0.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    when @xmath2 decreases , the three - body mass @xmath1 decreases very quickly and vanishes at the two - body mass value @xmath69 .",
    "this result was reproduced in ref .",
    "whereas the meaning of collapse as used in the thomas paper implies unbounded nonrelativistic binding energies and can not be used here , the zero bound state mass @xmath70 constitutes its relativistic counterpart . indeed , for two - body masses below the critical value @xmath71 , the three - body system no longer exists .",
    "we would like to remark that for @xmath72 , equation ( [ eq1 ] ) posses square integrable solutions with negative values of @xmath73 .",
    "they have no physical meaning but @xmath73 remains finite in all the two - body mass range @xmath74 $ ] .",
    "the results of @xmath73 are given in fig .",
    "when @xmath75 , @xmath73 tends to @xmath76 .     versus @xmath0 ( solid line ) in comparison to the three - boson bound state mass ( dash line).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the results for three - fermion system",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "qualitatively they are similar to the three - boson case with the curve shifted to smaller @xmath2 values . as a consequence",
    ", the critical value is @xmath77 instead of @xmath78 for bosons .",
    "this value may however depend on the particular type of spin coupling used in the two - body kernel .",
    "contrary to the boson case , the three - fermion system is unbound in the two - body zero binding limit .",
    "the binding appears when the two - fermion system is already bound by @xmath79 , that is , for an interaction strong enough to compensate the pauli repulsion .",
    "in summary , we have considered the relativistic problem of three equal - mass bosons and fermions , interacting via zero - range forces constrained to provide finite two - body mass @xmath0 .",
    "the light - front dynamics equations have been derived and solved numerically .",
    "we have found that the three - body bound state exists for two - body mass values in the range @xmath80 for bosons and @xmath81 for fermions . the thomas collapse is avoided in the sense that three - body mass @xmath1 is finite , in agreement with @xcite",
    ". however , another kind of catastrophe happens .",
    "removing infinite binding energies , the relativistic dynamics generates zero three - body mass @xmath1 at a critical value @xmath82 . for stronger interaction , i.e. when @xmath83 , there are no physical solutions with real value of @xmath1 . in this domain ,",
    "@xmath73 becomes negative and the three - body system can not be described by zero range forces , as it happens in nonrelativistic dynamics .",
    "this fact can be interpreted as a relativistic collapse .",
