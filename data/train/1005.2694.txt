    "-reinforcing brakes are a subject of intensive investigation during last years .",
    "working principle of such brakes is to use the wheelset s inertia momentum of a vehicle as the source of power for braking .",
    "one major advantage of self - reinforcing brakes is the energy consumption decrease which makes this research direction perspective .    at present",
    "the development of a new brake concept of a self - energizing electro - hydraulic brake for a railway application is being carried out at the institute for fluid power drives and control ( ifas , rwth aachen university ) .",
    "working principle of the braking system can be found in [ 69 ] .",
    "the control task of the self - energizing electro - hydraulic brake is to track the reference signal of the pressure @xmath0 ( the output variable ) in the supply line of the brake system .",
    "the control system with a pure proportional controller allows reaching the goal , as shown in fig .",
    "1 , where the reference signal represents a step function , whose values are the sequence \\{27 , 59 , 91 , 59 , 27 bar } , which corresponds to brake forces of \\{5 , 10 , 15 , 10 , 5 kn}. however , as seen from the figure , the oscillations of the supply line pressure appear in the system , which cause the oscillations of the brake force .        such a behavior of braking , of course , is inadmissible for passenger trains .",
    "therefore , the main requirement for the closed - loop system behavior is to get an aperiodic process of supply line pressure changes independent of the desired brake force level and friction coefficient variations of brake pads .",
    "to reach the required behavior of the controlled variable a controller of nonlinear structure is proposed to synthesize on basis of the exact feedback linearization method [ 3 ] , [ 5 ] .",
    "mathematical description of the electro - hydraulic system can be represented by a nonlinear model of 10^th^ order [ 6 ] .",
    "high order of the model result in the analytically complicated controller structure , which is a problem for simulation and experiments . due to simplifications based on the results of the brake system analysis [ 6 ] as well as the approach used in [ 1 ]",
    ", the basic model can be reduced to a 4^th^ order nonlinear model . for positive ( * case a * ) and negative ( * case b * ) valve opening this model has the form    * case",
    "a : * @xmath1    * case b : * @xmath2    where @xmath3  the load pressure of the brake actuator , the pressure in the supply line , the velocity and the control valve spool movement , respectively ; @xmath4  the ratio between piston areas of the brake actuator ; @xmath5  the pressure in the low pressure line ; @xmath6  the control valve parameters ; @xmath7  the known constant parameters ; @xmath8  the parameters dependent of the brake pads friction coefficient ; @xmath9  the control valve input signal .",
    "the output of the brake system is @xmath10 this model will be used for the controller synthesis in the following .",
    "the nonlinear model ( 1 )  ( 3 ) can be represented as    & = f(x)+g(x)u + y & = h(x )    the idea of the exact feedback linearization method is to find a nonlinear transformation ( linearization algorithm ) of a control signal , for which the model ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) is linear or equivalent to a linear model in new coordinates @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the coordinates transformation .    an important notion of an input - output model is its relative degree . for linear systems ,",
    "as known , the relative degree is the difference between the number of poles and zeros of the transfer function of a system .",
    "this is also the number of times an output needs to be differentiated in order that an input appears in the equation .",
    "for nonlinear systems it is defined in the similar manner . by differentiating the output @xmath13 and substituting ( 4 )",
    "we get ( see [ 2 ] ) @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are lie derivatives of the function @xmath17 along the vector field @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .    for the electro - hydraulic brake , for positive and negative valve opening , @xmath20 for all @xmath21 in the range of operating points .",
    "therefore @xmath22    continuing in this way , we get @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "consequently , @xmath25    the time derivative @xmath26 yields : @xmath27 where the lie derivative @xmath28 for all @xmath21 in the range of operating points and for positive and negative valve opening has the form    * case a : * @xmath29    * case b : * @xmath30    thus , the equation ( 8) with the nonzero factor for @xmath9 describes the relation between the input @xmath9 and the output @xmath13 . here , according to the definition in [ 3 ] , the relative degree of the 4th order nonlinear model of the electro - hydraulic brake  is  3 .    for linear state - space systems , derivatives of an output are chosen as state variables of a plant . using the similar approach",
    ", we determine new coordinates as @xmath31    for positive and negative valve spool movement , the new coordinates @xmath32 can be expressed by the coordinates @xmath21 of the simplified brake model ( 1 )  ( 3 ) , i.e.    * case a : *    z_1 & = p_sup + z_2 & = t^a_sup x _",
    "+ z_3 & = t^a_sup ( t^a_sup - t^a_l ) x^2 _ + t^a_sup v _    * case b : *    z_1 & = p_sup + z_2 & = t^b_sup x _",
    "+ z_3 & = t^b_sup ( t^b_sup - t^b_l ) x^2 _ + t^a_sup v _    in accordance with ( 11 ) , equations ( 5 )  ( 7 ) can be rewritten in the form @xmath33 where @xmath34 the function @xmath35 , for positive and negative valve spool movement , is determined by equations ( 9 ) , ( 10 ) , the function @xmath36 is expressed as    * case a : * @xmath37    * case b : * @xmath38    if models ( 1 )  ( 3 ) , and ( 12 ) where equivalent , than the exact feedback linearization problem would be solvable .",
    "this , in its turn , would mean that a control signal of the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a new control signal , due to overall compensation of the nonlinear functions @xmath36 and @xmath35 , would lead the plant model ( 1 )  ( 3 ) , on the assumption of parametric certainty of the model and measurability of the state variables @xmath21 , to a system , whose behaviour is exactly identical with the behaviour of the linear model    =    0 & 1 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 1 + 0 & 0 & 0 +    z_1 + z_2 + z_3 +    & +    0 + 0 + 1 +    , + y=    1 & 0 & 0 +    &    z_1 + z_2 + z_3 +    ,    whose output @xmath41 would coincide with the output @xmath42 of the simplified nonlinear model .",
    "however , since rank  @xmath43 for all @xmath21 in the range of operating points , which is less then the dimension @xmath44 of the model ( 1 )  ( 3 ) , the mapping @xmath12 is not a diffeomorphism .",
    "let us note that a mapping @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are smooth manifolds of dimension @xmath48 , is a diffeomorphism if @xmath49 is bijective and both @xmath49 and @xmath50 are smooth mapping ( see appendix a in [ 3 ] ) .",
    "considering aforesaid , the model ( 12 ) is not equivalent to the simplified nonlinear model ( 1 )  ( 3 ) .",
    "this is caused by the internal dynamics , i.e. behaviour of @xmath51-dimensional part of the nonlinear model , which , however , has no influence on the output ( 15 ) of the linear model ( 14 ) .    in that case",
    "the problem of input - output linearization can be solved [ 4 ] .",
    "this means that the control ( 13 ) transforms the nonlinear model ( 1 )  ( 3 ) of the electro - hydraulic brake into a model whose input - output behaviour can be represented in the form ( 14 ) , ( 15 ) .",
    "additionally , one more variable @xmath52 has to be supplemented with the new coordinates @xmath32 . according to proposition 4.1.3 in [ 3 ]",
    "it is always possible to find such a function that the jacobian matrix of the mapping @xmath53 is nonsingular at some point @xmath54 .    for the plant in question the load pressure of the brake actuator @xmath55",
    "was chosen as the additional variable , i.e. @xmath56 . the jacobian matrix of the mapping @xmath57 is nonsingular at each operating point of the brake .",
    "the time derivative of @xmath58 for positive and negative valve opening has the form    * case a : * @xmath59    * case b : * @xmath60 thus , the equivalent model in the new coordinates can be written as    & = q(z ) , + =    0 & 1 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 1 + 0 & 0 & 0 +    z_1 + z_2 + z_3 +    & +    0 + 0 + 1 +    ( ( , z)+(,z)u ) , + y&=z_1 ,    where the equation ( 18 ) for describes the zero - dynamics of the model ( 1 )  ( 3 ) . taking into consideration that @xmath61 , the functions @xmath62 and @xmath63 are expressed as @xmath64 the block diagram of the equivalent model is depicted in fig .  2 .",
    "thus we can conclude that for the self - energizing electro - hydraulic brake the controller synthesis based on the exact feedback linearization method is conventionally divided into the following steps .",
    "firstly , the control signal @xmath40 is determined for the linear model ( 14 ) , ( 15 ) , which describes the relationship between input and output variables of the nonlinear model ( 1 )  ( 3 ) .",
    "secondly , we take into consideration the internal dynamics of the plant , described by the equation ( 18 ) , which has no influence on the output of the linear model , see fig .  3 .",
    "finally , we generate the control signal @xmath9 of the 4^th^ order nonlinear model using the nonlinear transformation for the signal @xmath40 .",
    "the control @xmath9 is expressed as @xmath65    the obtained signal @xmath9 is the input signal for the real brake system , described by the nonlinear model of 10^th^ order .",
    "the linear model ( 14 ) gives the opportunity to use classical methods of linear systems theory to achieve the required control performance , i.e. to get an aperiodic behaviour of the output variable ( 15 ) of the model ( 14 ) .",
    "one such approach is the pole placement method which allows reaching any prescribed placement of closed loop system poles [ 10 ] .    according to the method the control input signal @xmath40 for the linear model ( 14 ) is chosen in the form @xmath66 where is the error , i.e. the difference between the reference state vector and the real state vector .",
    "since the reference signal @xmath67 is assumed to be a piecewise constant function , the reference signal @xmath68 of the model ( 14 ) during each time period , where @xmath67 is constant , can be represented as @xmath69 the row - vector @xmath70 provides prescribed poles placement of the following closed loop system @xmath71 where @xmath72    since the electro - hydraulic brake system in question is a siso system , i.e. a single - input single - output system , only the output @xmath0 is measured .",
    "consequently , not all state vector @xmath21 is known .",
    "it means that both the state vector @xmath32 of the model ( 14 ) , ( 15 ) and the variable @xmath58 of the model ( 18 ) are unmeasured .",
    "instead of these variables their estimates have to be used .",
    "therefore , the control system is supplemented with a full - order state observer for ( 14 ) , ( 15 ) . by means of the estimate @xmath73 of the vector",
    "@xmath32 the estimate @xmath74 of the variable @xmath58 can be calculated ( see ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) ) .",
    "the full - order state observer model is determined on the basis of the model ( 14 ) , ( 15 ) and has the form :    & = a + b+ k_obs(y- ) , + & = c^t ,    where @xmath75 is a column - vector of preset coefficients and .",
    "the vector @xmath75 is chosen such that the matrix of closed loop estimation system @xmath76 be hurwitz stable [ 10 ] .",
    "simulation results of the electro - hydraulic brake system of 10^th^ order with the controller of described nonlinear structure are shown in fig .",
    "one can see from the figure , that the nonlinear control algorithm synthesized on the basis of the exact feedback linearization method allows to get the desired closed - loop system behavior .",
    "the results of accomplished simulation demonstrated as well , that the control system is robust with respect to small variations of the friction coefficient .",
    "expansion of the robust stability ranges stimulates further development of the controller for the self - energizing electro - hydraulic brake .",
    "nonlinear control algorithm synthesis of the self - energizing electro - hydraulic brake on the basis of the exact feedback linearization method has been fulfilled . with the help of the obtained algorithm",
    "the problem of the desired closed - loop system behavior has been solved .",
