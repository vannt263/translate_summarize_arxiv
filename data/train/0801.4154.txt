    "probably the most promising corner of string theory to construct models with realistic particle spectra is heterotic m - theory , also known as the horava witten setup  @xcite . in it , the spacetime is taken to be minkowski space @xmath3 times a calabi - yau threefold @xmath4 times an interval @xmath5 in the eleventh direction .",
    "the two 10-dimensional boundaries each support a @xmath6 gauge theory , one of which should be broken by instantons and/or wilson lines to the standard model gauge group .",
    "the other @xmath7 is then hidden and only couples gravitationally to the visible sector .",
    "in addition , there can be a number of @xmath8-branes wrapping a curve of the calabi - yau threefold in the interior of the interval . in order to realize weak - scale supersymmetry breaking either the @xmath8-brane or the hidden @xmath7 gauge sector should break supersymmetry and gravitationally mediate the effect to the ( @xmath9 supersymmetric ) visible @xmath10 sector .      in order to find a compactification of heterotic m - theory one thus has to specify a calabi - yau threefold @xmath4 and two @xmath6 gauge bundles on it .",
    "for our purposes it will be convenient to pick an @xmath11 subgroup in @xmath6 , and use this group embedding to promote @xmath11 bundles ( that is , vector bundles @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) to @xmath6 bundles .",
    "the commutant of its holonomy @xmath14 inside the visible @xmath10 is then the unbroken low - energy gauge group in @xmath15 dimensions .    here",
    ", we are going to be interested in the case where @xmath12 is a rank @xmath15 holomorphic , slope stable ( hence preserving @xmath9 by itself ) vector bundle together with a @xmath16 wilson line .",
    "in other words , @xmath17 the unbroken gauge group is then @xmath18 the standard model gauge group times a @xmath19 which constrains proton decay .",
    "the ( visible ) matter fields of the effective @xmath15-dimensional theory correspond to the zero modes of the dirac operator @xmath20 on the calabi - yau threefold @xmath4 .",
    "they can be computed as the @xmath21 cohomology groups of the vector bundle @xmath12 and associated bundles @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 . in  @xcite",
    ", we constructed a suitable vector bundle yielding precisely the mssm matter spectrum of    * three families of quarks and leptons , * one ( up , down ) pair of higgs , and * no other charged fields .    one interesting possibility for the hidden sector ( cancelling the heterotic anomaly ) consists of an unbroken @xmath7 plus anti - five branes wrapping a rigid curve in the bulk  @xcite .",
    "see also  @xcite for other heterotic constructions .",
    "mathematically , deformations of holomorphic vector bundles are unobstructed ( at a smooth point in the bundle moduli space )",
    ". therefore , there can not be any perturbative superpotential for the bundle moduli fields .",
    "however , world - sheet instantons can , in principle , generate a superpotential .",
    "the action for a worldsheet instanton wrapped on a holomorphic curve @xmath25 is @xmath26    =    \\int_c \\omega    , \\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the complexified khler class @xmath28 the instanton - generated superpotential @xmath29 is then the sum over all holomorphic curves and weighted with the pfaffian ( a function of those moduli which determine the bundle restricted to @xmath25 ) : @xmath30 where    * @xmath31 are the @xmath32 vector bundle moduli , * @xmath33 are the @xmath34 complex structure moduli , and * @xmath35 are the @xmath36 khler moduli .    ignoring any torsion parts in homology and cohomology for the moment , we can generate @xmath37 by the basis two - forms @xmath38 of eq .   and",
    ", therefore , write the homology class of the curve @xmath25 as @xmath39 =     ( n_1,\\dots , n_{h^{11 } } ) = \\big ( \\int_c j_1 , \\dots , \\int_c j_{h^{11 } }    \\big )    \\in { \\ensuremath{{\\mathbb{z}}}}^{h^{11}}\\simeq h_2(x)\\ ] ] usually , we use the fourier - transformed khler moduli @xmath40 and write the instanton action part as @xmath41    unlikely as this may seem , in common constructions , like gauged linear sigma models and monad constructions , the bundle moduli superpotential eq .   vanishes .",
    "one possible explanation was offered by beasley and witten , who have argued  @xcite that the sum over all instantons within a given homology class vanishes under certain circumstances .",
    "that is , rewrite eq .",
    "as @xmath42 = \\vec{n } }        \\mathop{\\text{pf } } (        \\phi , c        )      \\right)}_{=0\\text { ? } }    \\prod q_a^{n_a}\\ ] ] then , for bundles coming from the toric ambient space , the inner sum actually does vanish .",
    "as we will see later in subsection  [ sec : numbers ] , this argument does not apply to our vector bundle .",
    "since our underlying calabi - yau threefold @xmath4 is not a toric complete intersection , this should not be too surprising .",
    "we now construct the calabi - yau threefold @xmath4 as a free @xmath16-quotient of a simply connected calabi - yau threefold @xmath43 .",
    "clearly , then , the fundamental group @xmath44 allows for suitable wilson lines , see subsection  [ sec : hsm ] .",
    "the covering space @xmath43 is the complete intersection calabi - yau threefold defined by a degree-@xmath45 and  @xmath46 polynomial in @xmath47 .",
    "discrete symmetries appear for special values of the complex structure moduli .",
    "in fact , there are _ two different _ loci in the complex structure moduli space with free @xmath48 group actions , leading to two different @xmath48 quotients .",
    "the two quotients have different complex structures , but can not be distinguished at the level of cohomology groups .",
    "one of the quotients was used in  @xcite to construct a heterotic mssm , and the explicit group action and polynomial equations can be found in  @xcite .",
    "however , we are now going to consider the other quotient , where one can use toric mirror symmetry .",
    "the covering space of the second quotient @xmath49 } \\times     { \\ensuremath{\\mathop{\\null { \\mathbb{p}}}}\\nolimits}^1_{[t_0:t_1 ] } \\times     { \\ensuremath{\\mathop{\\null { \\mathbb{p}}}}\\nolimits}^2_{[y_0:y_1:y_2]}\\ ] ] is the complete intersection ( see also  @xcite ) @xmath50 where we labelled three particular complex structure moduli @xmath51 .",
    "the significance of these three moduli is that they parametrize @xmath16 symmetric complete intersections .",
    "explicitly , the group action is ( @xmath52 ) @xmath53 \\mapsto        [ x_0:\\zeta x_1:\\zeta^2 x_2 ]        \\\\        [ t_0:t_1 ] \\mapsto        [ t_0:t_1 ]         ~\\text{(no action ) }        \\\\        [ y_0:y_1:y_2 ] \\mapsto        [ y_0:\\zeta y_1:\\zeta^2 y_2 ]      \\end{cases }      \\\\      g_2:&\\ ;      \\begin{cases }        [ x_0:x_1:x_2 ]",

    "\\end{cases }    \\end{split}\\ ] ] since the two equations are each cubic in one @xmath54 , one can easily see that @xmath43 is a double elliptic fibration .",
    "hence its euler number must be @xmath55 .",
    "a straightforward geometric calculation yields the hodge diamond , which turns out to be @xmath56 note that , as mentioned above , @xmath4 has @xmath57 complex structure parameters .",
    "the hurewicz isomorphism tells us that @xmath58 together with the hodge diamond eq .",
    ", the universal coefficient theorem and poincar duality , this determines the integral homology up to a finite , abelian group @xmath59 ( `` torsion '' ) .",
    "the resulting integral homology groups are given in table  [ tab : hxz ] .",
    "[ tab : hxz ]    @xmath60    the hard part is to compute the torsion part @xmath61 , that is , the torsion homology classes of curves in @xmath4 .",
    "clearly , such a torsion homology class can not be represented by a holomorphic curve .",
    "however , as we will see , torsion homology classes can be represented by formal differences of holomorphic curves .",
    "it turns out that @xmath62 how did we obtain this ?",
    "first , note that by definition we have a quotient map @xmath63 which induces the push - forward in homology , @xmath64_{q }        &         h_2({{\\ensuremath{\\widetilde{x}}}},{\\ensuremath{{\\mathbb{z}}}})={\\ensuremath{{\\mathbb{z}}}}^{19 }        \\ar[d]_{q_\\ast }        \\\\        x        &         h_2(x,{\\ensuremath{{\\mathbb{z}}}})={\\ensuremath{{\\mathbb{z}}}}^3\\oplus { \\ensuremath{{\\mathbb{z}}}}_3 \\oplus { \\ensuremath{{\\mathbb{z}}}}_3       } } \\ ] ] the @xmath16 group action on @xmath43 identifies curves @xmath65 the quotient under this equivalence relation is called `` coinvariant homology '' , and denoted as @xmath66 . by explicitly constructing a basis of curves on @xmath4 and identifying the group action on them , one can explicitly determine the @xmath16-group action on @xmath67 in terms of two commuting @xmath68 matrices .",
    "we found that  @xcite @xmath69 in general , the relationship between coinvariant homology and the homology of the quotient @xmath70 is determined by the cartan - leray spectral sequence @xmath71 without going into details , we point out that the @xmath72 column of the @xmath73 tableau is the coinvariant homology , @xmath74 but , as usual , there are more entries in the spectral sequence , as well as higher differentials and extension ambiguities .",
    "however , one can show  @xcite that these ultimately do not contribute to @xmath75 .    to summarize , the homology classes of curves are given in eq .",
    "the torsion curve classes can be understood as coinvariant curve classes on the covering space @xmath43 .",
    "having constructed the calabi - yau threefold @xmath4 , we would like to identify the holomorphic curves on it .",
    "the well - known trick to count the curves is via the instanton corrections to the yukawa couplings in the standard embedding , @xmath76 the instanton numbers are encoded in the power series @xmath77 , multi - indexed by @xmath78 .",
    "fortunately , the @xmath79 power series come from a single prepotential @xmath80 the trilogarithm in the prepotential takes care of multi - covers of a single instanton . written as in eq .  , the expansion coefficients @xmath81 are the instanton numbers , and they count are still integers , but may be negative . ]",
    "the holomorphic curves in the homology class @xmath82 .",
    "after properly distinguishing the torsion curves , the prepotential must be of the form @xmath88 knowing the general form of the series expansion , how do we go about and compute it ?",
    "we compared three different approaches  @xcite    * start on @xmath43 and mod out @xmath16 . + the prepotential on @xmath43",
    "is partially known  @xcite .",
