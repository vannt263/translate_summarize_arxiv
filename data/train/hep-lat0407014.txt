    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the su(3 ) gauge theory , was first proposed by yoichiro nambu @xcite in 1966 as a candidate for the fundamental theory of the strong interaction , just after the introduction of the  new \" quantum number ,  color \" @xcite . in spite of its simple form",
    ", qcd creates thousands of hadrons and leads to various interesting nonperturbative phenomena such as color confinement @xcite and dynamical chiral - symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "even now , it is very difficult to deal with qcd due to its strong - coupling nature in the infrared region .    in recent years",
    ", the lattice qcd monte carlo calculation becomes a reliable and useful method for the analysis of nonperturbative qcd @xcite , which indicates an important direction in the hadron physics . in this paper , using lattice qcd , we study the inter - quark potential in detail @xcite .",
    "in general , the three - body force is regarded as a residual interaction in most fields in physics . in qcd , however , the three - body force among three quarks is a  primary \" force reflecting the su(3 ) gauge symmetry .",
    "in fact , the three - quark ( 3q ) potential is directly responsible for the structure and properties of baryons , similar to the relevant role of the q-@xmath4 potential for meson properties , and both the q-@xmath4 potential and the 3q potential are equally important fundamental quantities in qcd .",
    "furthermore , the 3q potential is the key quantity to clarify the quark confinement in baryons .",
    "however , in contrast to the q-@xmath4 potential @xcite , there was almost no lattice qcd study for the 3q potential before our study in 1999 @xcite , in spite of its importance in the hadron physics .",
    "the q-@xmath5 potential is known to be well described with the inter - quark distance @xmath6 as @xcite @xmath7 as for the 3q potential form , we note two theoretical arguments at short and long distance limits .",
    "\\1 . at the short distance , perturbative qcd is applicable , and therefore 3q potential is expressed as the sum of the two - body coulomb potential originating from the one - gluon - exchange process .    \\2 . at the long distance ,",
    "the strong - coupling expansion of qcd is plausible , and it leads to the flux - tube picture @xcite . for the 3q system",
    ", there appears a junction which connects the three flux - tubes from the three quarks , and y - type flux - tube formation is expected @xcite .",
    "then , we theoretically conjecture the functional form of the 3q potential as the coulomb plus y - type linear potential , i.e. , y - ansatz , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the minimal value of the total flux - tube length . of course , it is nontrivial that these simple arguments on uv and ir limits of qcd hold for the intermediate region .",
    "then , we study the 3q potential in lattice qcd .",
    "note that the lattice qcd calculation is completely independent of any ansatz for the potential form .",
    "similar to the q-@xmath5 potential calculated with the wilson loop , the 3q potential can be calculated with the 3q wilson loop @xcite defined as @xmath10 with @xmath11 in fig.1 .",
    "the 3q wilson loop physically means that a color - singlet gauge - invariant 3q state is created at @xmath12 and is annihilated at @xmath13 with the three quarks spatially fixed for @xmath14 .    .",
    ", height=128 ]    the vacuum expectation value of the 3q wilson loop is expressed as @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the @xmath17th energy of the gauge - field configuration in the presence of the spatially - fixed three quarks @xcite .    while @xmath16 depends only on the 3q location",
    ", @xmath18 depends on the operator choice for the 3q state . for the accurate calculation",
    ", we need to reduce the excited - state component , i.e. , @xmath19 , in the 3q state prepared at @xmath12 and @xmath20 .",
    "the smearing is a useful method to construct the quasi - ground - state operator in lattice qcd in a gauge - invariant manner , and is actually successful for the ground - state q-@xmath5 potential @xcite .",
    "( note that the smearing is just a method to construct the operator , and hence it never changes the gauge configuration unlike the cooling . )",
    "the smeared link - variable @xmath21 includes a spatial extension , and the smeared `` line '' expressed with @xmath21 corresponds to a gaussian - distributed `` flux - tube '' in terms of the original link - variable @xcite .",
    "therefore , the properly smeared line is expected to resemble the ground - state flux - tube .",
    "then , through the selection of the properly smeared 3q wilson loop @xmath22\\rangle$ ] , we can construct the ground - state - dominant 3q operator for the accurate measurement of the ground - state 3q potential @xcite .      for more than 300 different patterns of spatially - fixed 3q systems ,",
    "we perform the thorough calculation of the ground - state potential @xmath0 in su(3 ) lattice qcd with the standard plaquette action with @xmath23 at @xmath24 and with @xmath25 at @xmath26=5.8 and 6.0 at the quenched level . for the accurate measurement",
    ", we use the smearing method and construct the ground - state - dominant 3q operator @xcite .    to conclude , we find that the static ground - state 3q potential @xmath0 is well described by the coulomb plus y - type linear potential ( y - ansatz ) within 1%-level deviation @xcite .      to clarify the current status of the 3q potential",
    ", we introduce recent works of other groups .",
    "de forcrand s group , who once supported @xmath27-ansatz in lattice qcd @xcite , seems to change their opinion from @xmath27-ansatz to y - ansatz @xcite .",
    "kuzmenko and simonov also showed that the delta - shape is impossible from gauge - invariance point of view , and the y - shaped configuration is the only possible for the three - quark system @xcite .",
    "one of the theoretical basis of @xmath27-ansatz was cornwall s conjecture based on the vortex vacuum model @xcite .",
    "recently , cornwall re - examined his previous work and found that the correct answer is y - ansatz instead of @xmath27-ansatz @xcite .    in this way , y - ansatz for the static 3q potential seems almost settled both in lattice qcd and in analytic framework .",
    "recently , as a clear evidence for y - ansatz , y - type flux - tube formation is actually observed in maximally - abelian ( ma ) projected lattice qcd from the measurement of the action density in the spatially - fixed 3q system @xcite .",
    "( see fig.2 . )",
    "motivated by the recent discovery of the penta - quark baryon @xmath28 , we perform the first study of the static penta - quark ( 5q ) potential @xmath3 in su(3 ) lattice qcd with @xmath26=6.0 and @xmath29 32 at the quenched level .",
    "we investigate the qq-@xmath5-qq configuration as shown in fig.3 . with the smearing method @xcite to enhance the ground - state component , we accurately calculate the 5q potential @xmath3 from the 5q wilson loop @xmath30 as shown in fig.4 in a gauge - invariant manner .    -qq type configuration for the penta - quark system .",

    "note that there appear three kinds of coulomb coefficients ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) in the penta - quark system , while only one coulomb coefficient , @xmath39 or @xmath40 , appears in the q@xmath4 or the 3q system .",
    "( in eq.([pentaform ] ) , @xmath36 corresponds to @xmath40 or @xmath41 in terms of the oge result . )",
    "figure 5 shows the lattice qcd results for the 5q potential @xmath3 .",
    "the symbols denote the lattice data , and the curves denote the theoretical form of the oge plus multi - y ansatz with ( @xmath36,@xmath42 ) fixed to be ( @xmath40,@xmath43 ) in the 3q potential @xmath44 in ref.@xcite .",
    "( note that there is no adjustable parameter for the theoretical curves besides an irrelevant constant @xmath45 , since @xmath36 and @xmath42 are fixed . )",
    "one finds a good agreement between the lattice data and the oge plus multi - y ansatz .",
    "we note that the multi - quark system including four or more quarks can take a three - dimensional shape , while the q@xmath5 and the 3q systems can take only planar configuration .",
    "then , we investigate also the twisted 5q configuration , and find that the planar and the twisted 5q configurations are almost degenerate .",
    "then , no special configuration is favored in the 5q system in terms of the energy , and general 5q systems tend to take a three - dimensional configuration .    from the comparison with the q@xmath5 and the 3q potentials @xcite",
    ", the universality of the string tension and the oge result are found among q@xmath5 , 3q and 5q systems as @xmath46 this result supports the flux - tube picture on the confinement mechanism even for the multi - quark system .",
    "in 1969 , y.  nambu first pointed out the string picture for hadrons @xcite .",
    "since then , the string picture has been one of the most important pictures for hadrons and has provided many interesting ideas in the wide region of the particle physics .",
    "for instance , the hadronic string creates infinite number of hadron resonances as the vibrational modes , and these excitations lead to the hagedorn  ultimate \" temperature @xcite , which gives an interesting theoretical picture for the qcd phase transition .    for the real hadrons , of course",
    ", the hadronic string is to have a spatial extension like the flux - tube , as the result of one - dimensional squeezing of the color - electric flux in accordance with color confinement @xcite .",
    "therefore , the vibrational modes of the hadronic flux - tube should be much more complicated , and the analysis of the excitation modes is important to clarify the underlying picture for real hadrons .    in the language of qcd",
    ", such non - quark - origin excitation is called as the  gluonic excitation \" , and is physically interpreted as the excitation of the gluon - field configuration in the presence of the quark - antiquark pair or the three quarks .    in the hadron physics ,",
    "the gluonic excitation is one of the interesting phenomena beyond the quark model , and relates to the hybrid hadrons such as @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "in particular , the hybrid meson includes the exotic hadrons with @xmath49 , which can not be constructed within the simple quark model .    in this section , we study the excited - state 3q potential and the gluonic excitation using lattice qcd @xcite , to get deeper insight on these excitations beyond the hypothetical models such as the string and the flux - tube models . here",
    ", the excited - state 3q potential is the energy of the excited state of the gluon - field configuration in the presence of the static three quarks , and the gluonic - excitation energy is expressed as the energy difference between the ground - state 3q potential and the excited - state 3q potential .",
    "we present the formalism to extract the excited - state potential @xcite . for the simple notation",
    ", the ground state is regarded as the `` 0th excited state '' . for the physical eigenstates of the qcd hamiltonian @xmath50 for the spatially - fixed 3q system",
    ", we denote the @xmath17th excited state by @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "since the three quarks are spatially fixed in this case , the eigenvalue of @xmath50 is expressed by a static potential as @xmath53 , where @xmath16 denotes the @xmath17th excited - state 3q potential .",
    "note that both @xmath16 and @xmath54 are universal physical quantities relating to the qcd hamiltonian @xmath50 .",
    "in fact , @xmath16 depends only on the 3q location , and @xmath54 satisfies the orthogonal condition as @xmath55 .",
    "suppose that @xmath56 are arbitrary given independent spatially - fixed 3q states .",
    "in general , each 3q state @xmath57 can be expressed by a linear combination of 3q physical eigenstates @xmath58 , @xmath59 depend on the selection of @xmath57 , and hence they are not universal quantities .",
    "the euclidean - time evolution of the 3q state @xmath60 is expressed with the operator @xmath61 , which corresponds to the transfer matrix in lattice qcd .",
    "the overlap @xmath62 is given by the 3q wilson loop with the initial state @xmath63 at @xmath12 and the final state @xmath64 at @xmath13 , and is expressed in the euclidean heisenberg picture as @xmath65 using the matrix @xmath66 satisfying @xmath67 and the diagonal matrix @xmath68 as @xmath69 , we rewrite the above relation as @xmath70 note here that @xmath66 is not a unitary matrix , and hence this relation does not mean the simple diagonalization by the unitary transformation .",
    "since we are interested in the 3q potential @xmath71 in @xmath68 rather than the non - universal matrix @xmath66 , we single out @xmath71 from the 3q wilson loop @xmath72 as @xmath73 which is a similarity transformation .",
    "then , @xmath74 can be obtained as the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath75 , i.e. , solutions of the secular equation , @xmath76 thus , the 3q potential @xmath16 can be obtained from the matrix @xmath75 .    in the practical calculation ,",
    "we prepare @xmath77 independent sample states @xmath78 . by choosing appropriate states",
    "@xmath57 so as not to include highly excited - state components , the physical states @xmath51 can be truncated as @xmath79 . then , @xmath72 , @xmath66 and @xmath68 are reduced into @xmath80 matrices , and the secular equation ( [ secular ] ) becomes the @xmath77th order equation .",
    "for about 100 different patterns of spatially - fixed 3q systems , we calculate the excited - state potential using su(3 ) lattice qcd with @xmath25 at @xmath26=5.8 and 6.0 at the quenched level @xcite . in fig.6 , we show the 1st excited - state 3q potential @xmath1 and the ground - state potential @xmath0 .     and the ground - state 3q potential @xmath0 .",
    "the lattice results at @xmath81 and @xmath82 well coincide besides an irrelevant overall constant .",
    "the gluonic excitation energy @xmath2 is found to be about 1gev in the hadronic scale .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",height=124 ]   and the ground - state 3q potential @xmath0 .",
    "the lattice results at @xmath81 and @xmath82 well coincide besides an irrelevant overall constant .",
    "the gluonic excitation energy @xmath2 is found to be about 1gev in the hadronic scale .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",height=124 ]    the energy gap between @xmath0 and @xmath1 physically means the excitation energy of the gluon - field configuration in the presence of the spatially - fixed three quarks , and the gluonic excitation energy @xmath2 is found to be about 1gev @xcite in the hadronic scale as @xmath83 .",
    "note that the gluonic excitation energy of about 1gev is rather large in comparison with the excitation energies of the quark origin .",
    "the present result predicts that the lowest hybrid baryon , which is described as @xmath48 in the valence picture , has a large mass of about 2 gev @xcite .",
    "( the present result seems to suggest the constituent gluon mass of about 1gev . )",
    "finally , we consider the connection between qcd and the quark model in terms of the gluonic excitation @xcite . while qcd is described with quarks and gluons , the simple quark model successfully describes low - lying hadrons even without explicit gluonic modes .",
    "in fact , the gluonic excitation seems invisible in the low - lying hadron spectra , which is rather mysterious .    on this point",
    ", we find the gluonic - excitation energy to be about 1gev or more , which is rather large compared with the excitation energies of the quark origin , and therefore the effect of gluonic excitations is negligible and quark degrees of freedom plays the dominant role in low - lying hadrons with the excitation energy below 1gev .",
    "thus , the large gluonic - excitation energy of about 1gev gives the physical reason for the invisible gluonic excitation in low - lying hadrons , which would play the key role for the success of the quark model without gluonic modes @xcite .",
