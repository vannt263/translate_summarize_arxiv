    "the field of open quantum systems is of paramount importance in quantum theory @xcite .",
    "it helps to understand fundamental problems as decoherence , the quantum to classical transition , or the measurement problem @xcite . besides",
    ", it has been essential to reach an impressive level of control in experiments of different quantum systems , which are the cornerstone in recent development of quantum technologies @xcite .",
    "the usual approach to quantum open systems relies on the assumption that the evolution has negligible memory effects .",
    "this supposition is part of the so - called born - markov approximation , which also assumes weak system - environment coupling and a large environment .",
    "the keystone of markovian quantum dynamics is the lindblad master equation @xcite which describes the generator of quantum dynamical semigroups .",
    "the behavior of several interesting and realistic quantum systems has been studied using the born - markov approximation .",
    "however , these assumptions ( weak coupling or large size of the environment ) can not be applied in many situations , including recent experiments of quantum control .",
    "this shows the importance of understanding quantum open systems beyond the born - markov approximation .",
    "a great amount of work ( see @xcite and references therein ) has been done to understand and characterize non - markovian quantum evolutions or non - markovianity ( nm )  as it is generically called .",
    "this not only gives us a better understanding of open quantum systems but also provides more efficient ways to control quantum systems .",
    "for example , it was recently shown that non - markovianity is an essential resource in some instances of steady state entanglement preparation  @xcite or can be exploited to carry out quantum control tasks that could not be realized in closed systems @xcite .",
    "besides , non - markovian environments can speed up quantum evolutions reducing the quantum speed limit @xcite .",
    "unlike other properties , like entanglement , there is not a unique definition of non - markovianity .",
    "there exist different criteria , more or less physically motivated , which in turn can be associated to a measure  @xcite .",
    "the two most popular criteria are based on distinguishability  @xcite and divisibility  @xcite , from which two corresponding measures can be derived .",
    "there exist other measures  @xcite which are basically variations of these two or are very similar .",
    "all of these measures present some of the following problems : lack of a clear and intuitive physical interpretation , they can diverge in very generic cases  @xcite , and they are not directly comparable between them .",
    "another problem is that , even if at least one of them has an intuitive physical interpretation , in terms of information flow  @xcite , neither , to our knowledge , has a direct relation to a resource associated to a task  like entanglement of formation has .    in this work ,",
    "we pursue two goals .",
    "first , we want to construct nm measures without the mentioned drawbacks .",
    "we undertake this task within the framework of channel capacities .",
    "the proposed measures are based on the maximum revival of the capacities , a characteristic that has a very simple physical interpretation and has a natural time - independent bound . of course there",
    "might  and most likely will ",
    "exist many possible measures of quantum non- markovianity .",
    "thus , we first provide a general setting and then put forward two plausible , meaningful quantitative measures . our second goal is to outline the theoretical bases for considering nm as a resource .",
    "consider what we call a quantum vault ( qv ) .",
    "alice shall deposit information , classical or quantum , in a quantum physical system ( say in a physical realization of a qubit ) ; during some time , through which the system evolves , the physical system can be subject to an attack by an eavesdropper , eve ; finally , after that time interval , the information is to be retrieved by alice from the same physical system .",
    "of course , the system interacts with an environment , to which neither alice nor eve can access .",
    "notice that this task can be related with quantum data hiding  @xcite .",
    "we show that one of the nm measures proposed is closely related to the efficiency of the quantum vault .",
    "therefore the value of the measure can be considered a resource associated to a specific task .    to illustrate our ideas we analyze two examples of physical systems coupled to non - markovian environments , and analyze the newly defined measures as well as their quantum vault capabilities .",
    "we also explain possible advantages with respect to other nm measures .",
    "first we study a qubit , coupled via pure dephasing to an environment whose dynamics are given by a mixed quantum map .",
    "different kinds of dynamics can be explored , changing the initial state of the environment . for the measures proposed in previous works",
    ", this sometimes leads to an unexpected behavior .",
    "the other example we consider is the well known jaynes - cummings model ( jcm ) @xcite , a two level atom coupled to a bosonic bath , where we contrast our proposals , with some of the most used nm measures .",
    "the work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ measures ] we describe the general framework that relates nm with capacities of a quantum channel .",
    "then , we define two nm measures based on the largest revival of the capacities . in sec . [ sec : quantum_vault ] we introduce the concept of quantum vault and show its relation to the new nm measures .",
    "[ sec : examples ] is devoted to analyzing two examples using the ideas presented in the previous sections .",
    "we end the paper with some final remarks in sec . v.",
    "the two most widely spread nm measures are , one due to breuer et al .  @xcite based on distinguishability ( in the following abbreviated by `` blp '' ) , and the other due to rivas et al .",
    "@xcite based on divisibility ( `` rhp '' ) . at the heart of both measures , there is a well defined concept which has been borrowed from classical stochastic systems . in the case of blp , it is the contraction of probability space under markovian stochastic processes , while in the case of rhp , it is the divisibility of the process itself .",
    "both concepts can be used as criteria for quantum markovianity by _ defining _ that a quantum process is markovian if the distinguishability between all pairs of evolving states is non - increasing ( blp - property ) , or if the process is divisible ( rhp - property ) ; otherwise the process is called non - markovian .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , that the semigroup property of a quantum process implies the rhp - property and that the rhp - property implies the blp - property .",
    "in order to obtain a non - markovianity ( nm ) measure , both groups of authors apply essentially the same procedure : integrate a differential measure for the violation of the corresponding criterion .",
    "the same construction principle has been used in ref .",
    "@xcite , to quantify nm based on channel capacities .",
    "consider the convex space of all quantum channels , and in this space a continuous curve @xmath0 with @xmath1 starting at the identity @xmath2 .",
    "we will call such a curve a _ quantum process_. any resource @xmath3 of interest will be a function on the space of quantum channels . thus any quantum process comes along with the function @xmath4 quantifying the resource the quantum channel provides at time @xmath5 . postulating that @xmath6 can not increase during markovian dynamics",
    ", one defines the function @xmath7= \\int_{\\dot k > 0 } \\dot k(\\tau)\\ , { \\mathrm{d}}\\tau \\ ; , \\label{}\\ ] ] as a measure for non - markovianity .",
    "we use the subscript @xmath8 for this class of measures , as it is possible that one has to add an infinite number of contributions ( all intervals where @xmath9 > 0 ) .",
    "we use brackets to indicate a functional on the space of quantum processes , and parenthesis when we refer to a functional on the space of quantum channels .",
    "one can immediately derive a criterion for non - markovianity , namely @xmath10 > 0 $ ] . in the case of rhp ,",
    "@xmath11 where @xmath12 is the trace - norm and @xmath13 is the choi representation  @xcite of the map @xmath14 , which evolves states from time @xmath15 to time @xmath16 . in the case of blp",
    "@xmath17 \\ ; , \\label{def : blpmeasure}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the trace distance between the two states @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the initial states @xmath21 are chosen to maximize the respective nm measure .",
    "the measures defined in ref .",
    "@xcite , can also be cast in this form . in that case , @xmath6 is directly defined as the corresponding channel capacity of @xmath0 .    for definitiveness ,",
    "two different channel capacities are considered in this work , that for entanglement assisted communication , and that for quantum communication  @xcite .",
    "note that also much simpler measures such as average fidelity , purity , or some measure of entanglement , may be cast into that form .",
    "this construction , which includes contributions from a possibly infinite number of intervals where @xmath22 , may result in rather inconvenient properties .",
    "for instance , @xmath23 $ ] tends to overvalue small fluctuations , which typically occur in the case of a finite environment , finite statistics or experimental fluctuations .",
    "this might even lead to the divergence of the measure .",
    "this can be remedied by normalizing such as in  @xcite , where the authors consider @xmath23\\ , ( a + { \\mathcal{m}}^{\\infty}_{\\mathcal{k}}[\\lambda_t])^{-1}$ ] with @xmath24 .",
    "however , this normalization is completely arbitrary , as any other scale for @xmath25 would be equally well acceptable . even if the measures yield finite values , it is not clear how one should interpret a statement that one process has a larger value for blp - nm ( rhp - nm ) than another .",
    "it is even less possible to compare values obtained for different measures .",
    "therefore , these measures should be considered as non - markovianity criterion .    here",
    ", we will show that a rather simple modification of the construction can avoid these issues , and lead to a clear physical interpretation of the resulting nm measures .",
    "the modification consists in considering only the largest revival with respect to either ( i ) the minimum value of @xmath26 prior to the revival or ( ii ) to the average value prior to the revival .",
    "thus , we take @xmath27 = \\max_{t_f,\\tau \\le t_f } \\left [ k(t_{f } ) - k(\\tau ) \\right ] \\label{eq : gorinnm}\\ ] ] in the first case and @xmath28 = \\max \\left\\ { 0 , \\max_{t_f } \\left [ k(t_f ) - { \\langle}k(\\tau ) { \\rangle}_{\\tau < t_f } \\right ] \\right\\ } \\label{eq : carlosnm}\\ ] ] in the second . here",
    ", @xmath29 denotes time average until @xmath30 . in the first case",
    ", we are measuring the biggest revival during the time interval whereas in the second , we are measuring a revival , but with respect to the average behavior prior to this time .",
    "notice that @xmath28 \\le { \\mathcal{m}}^{\\max}_{\\mathcal{k}}[\\lambda_t ] \\label { } \\label{eq : ineq}\\ ] ] as @xmath31 .",
    "moreover , also notice that @xmath32>0 \\iff { \\mathcal{m}}^{\\max}_{\\mathcal{k}}[\\lambda_t ] > 0 , \\label{eq : iff}\\ ] ] though no such relation is found for @xmath33 .",
    "in fact , we shall see later that non - monotonic behavior _ does not _ guarantee a positive value for @xmath33 .",
    "we consider a quantum system , which is used to store and retrieve information by state preparation and measurement . the quantum system is coupled to an inaccessible environment and we describe its dynamics by a quantum process . in order to use the system ,",
    "alice encodes her information ( which may be quantum or classical ) in a quantum state .",
    "then , at some later time alice attempts to retrieves the information from the evolved quantum state .",
    "note that this state need not be equal to the initial state , it is sufficient that alice is able to recover her information from it .",
    "the capacity of the device depends on the amount of information which can be stored and faithfully retrieved . during the time in which the information is stored , it might be subject to an attack by an eavesdropper eve . some important remarks should be mentioned .",
    "eve has a finite probability of attacking , and her attack destroys the quantum state .",
    "we assume that alice becomes aware if there is an attack and discards the state .",
    "a good quantum vault is such that alice can obtain her information with high reliability and between state preparation and read - out , the information is difficult to retrieve .    the process , until the measurement by alice or eve , shall be described by the quantum process @xmath34 , while the information shall be quantified by a capacity @xmath35 .",
    "we shall thus have a time dependent value of the capacity , analogous to eq .",
    "( [ eq : k : of : t ] ) .",
    "the times considered range from @xmath36 , with @xmath37 being the time at which alice attempts to retrieve the information . the average information that can be obtained by eve per attack is then @xmath38 , where the average is taken during the vault operation , namely from @xmath39 until @xmath37 .",
    "here we assume that when eve attacks , she does only once , as an attack destroys the state anyway .",
    "if eve attacks with a probability @xmath40 , on average she will obtain the information @xmath41 . thus , the average information successfully retrieved by alice will be only @xmath42 .",
    "we shall consider as a figure of merit the difference between the average information obtained by alice , and the one obtained by eve : @xmath43 note that this quantity can be negative , when eve obtains on average more information than alice can retrieve .",
    "finally , we may define the quantum vault efficiency as @xmath44 , with @xmath45 .",
    "a good quantum vault should have an efficiency close to one .",
    "assume that @xmath35 is normalized in such way that @xmath46 is the probability that the message encoded in the state will be retrieved .",
    "a successful run can be defined as a run in which , if eve attacks , she gains no information , whereas if eve does not attack , alice retrieves successfully the information . from the considerations above , one can see that the probability of having a successful run is given by @xmath47 associated with this probability , we shall associate a quality factor for the channel , as a quantum vault , that is simply the above probability , weighted by the capacity of the channel , that is @xmath48 .    now we shall discuss @xmath49 and @xmath50 for some particular examples and establish its relation to @xmath51 .",
    "we first examine the worst case scenario : @xmath52 . by definition , if eve attacks she destroys the state . this fact is reflected in @xmath49 which can go from minimal value @xmath53 ( worst efficiency @xmath54 ) to @xmath55 ( poor qv ) , when @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath50 on the other hand ranges from @xmath57 ( i.e. bad qv ) to @xmath58 . in the last case large @xmath50 value due to small @xmath59",
    "evidences the fact that eve is unable to obtain anything . in the best case scenario of @xmath60 ,",
    "evidently , the efficiency of the vault is only tied to @xmath61 , the larger the better .",
    "now let us assess the general case .",
    "we will only take into account the case where @xmath62 , i.e. from eq .",
    "( [ eq : carlosnm ] ) there is at least one @xmath30 for which @xmath63 . the first relation between the qv and @xmath51 that we find is @xmath64 which is easy to derive from the definition , provided @xmath30 is the same for both .",
    "this relation sets lower and upper bounds for the qv , depending on @xmath40 and @xmath65 [ a corresponding relation with @xmath50 follows directly from eq .",
    "( [ eq : pq ] ) ] .",
    "a reasonable assumption is that information about the probability of attack by eve , @xmath40 is not known .",
    "one can invoke a maximum entropy principle to use the average value of @xmath40 , namely @xmath66 .",
    "for this unbiased case , ( and @xmath62 ) we have @xmath67 these equations relate the nm measure proposed , with the possibility to perform the task at hand .",
    "in particular , it gives an operational meaning to the measures proposed here , and show that , for the task proposed here , the figure of merit is @xmath51 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ejemplos ] we show some examples one could encounter for @xmath68 . in the first one ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ejemplos ] , top - left ) we have @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 so for a fixed @xmath40 , a large @xmath65 implies high efficiency .",
    "this is in fact the ideal scenario for a qv , because most of the time the information is hidden and inaccessible to eve and at time @xmath30 the information can be retrieved with high accuracy .     to be considered as qv .",
    "( top - left ) example with large @xmath72 and @xmath65 , good qv candidate .",
    "( top - right ) worst case scenario .",
    "small @xmath72 , small ( or null ) @xmath65 and infromation always available for eve to grab .",
    "( bottom - left ) small @xmath65 an @xmath49 ( poor in for information retrieval ) but decent @xmath50 ( good for information protection ) .",
    "( bottom - left ) more general case , strongly depending on @xmath65 and the height of the peak at @xmath30 .",
    "[ fig : ejemplos ] ]    if @xmath59 is very large , close to @xmath73 ( e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : ejemplos ] top - right ) , then , by definition , the channel is not a good qv : a large proportion of the information is readily available at all times before @xmath30 . here",
    "@xmath74 ( so eq .  ( [ eq : deltakineq ] )",
    "does not hold ) , but the only possibility to have good efficiency is the trivial @xmath75 case . if , on the other hand , @xmath59 and @xmath61 are both very small ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ejemplos ] bottom - left ) ",
    "again @xmath76 there is little chance to retrieve the information , even for small @xmath40 , yielding poor efficiency and @xmath50 . for large @xmath40",

    "the interpretation of this large value of @xmath50 is that eve will likely attack , but unsucceesfully .",
    "finally , we consider the case where @xmath6 decays monotonously except for one bump ( e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : ejemplos ] bottom - right ) .",
    "the analysis now requires a little more care . if @xmath78 , which happens for a small enough bump , then @xmath79 , and there is no connection between @xmath49 ( or @xmath50 ) and @xmath80 .",
    "the analysis is similar to that of fig .",
    "[ fig : ejemplos ] ( top - right ) . on the other hand if @xmath62 the efficiency is bounded by eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltakineq ] ) and for maximum @xmath65 , the case is equivalent to the first one ( top - left ) .",

    "we consider that the environment evolves according to a dynamics that in the semiclassical limit is mixed , i.e. has integrable and chaotic regions in phase space .    a simple way to realize such environment is using a controlled kicked quantum map  @xcite . in this case ,",
    "the environment evolution is slightly modified depending on the state of the qubit .",
    "this is equivalent to having a coupling with the environment that commutes with the hamiltonians corresponding to the free evolution of each part , qubit and environment .     as a function of time for two different initial states of an environment modeled by the quantum harper map .",
    "( right ) the classical phase space of the environment for the parameters studied ( see main text ) .",
