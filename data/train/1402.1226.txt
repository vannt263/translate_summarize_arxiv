    "point defects and impurities are ubiquitous in semiconductors or insulators and strongly dominate a wide variety of materials properties such as optical , mechanical , electrical , and transport properties , having a decisive impact on their performance in applications , e.g. photovoltaics , photocatalysts , ionic conductors , transistors , and light emitting diodes .",
    "therefore , knowledge and precise control of defects are inherently keys to the smart design of materials with superior performance . despite the importance , it is difficult to directly and fully study point defects by experiments , and first - principles calculations have emerged as an invaluable tool for modeling and understanding the point defects .",
    "@xcite in particular , a rapid progress on the computational speed and electronic structure calculation methods as represented by hybrid functionals , quantum monte carlo , and the gw approximation allows us to predict the defect properties semi - quantitatively or even quantitatively in recent years .",
    "@xcite these calculations support and complement experimental findings .",
    "the first - principles point defect calculations commonly rely on the supercell approach under periodic boundary conditions",
    ". however , the cell sizes are not usually sufficiently large for describing the low concentration of defects in realistic materials such as 10@xmath3  10@xmath4 @xmath5 . calculations using common approximations to density functional theory ( dft ) , viz . local density approximation",
    "( lda ) or generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) , can treat a few thousand atoms at most , and hybrid functionals such as the heyd - scuseria - ernzerhof functional ( hse06 )  @xcite up to a few hundred atoms , which corresponds to 10@xmath6 ",
    "10@xmath7 @xmath5 .",
    "it is notorious that the formation energy of the charged defect calculated with such smaller supercells could include huge convergence errors up to several ev . in case that the defect charge is encased in the supercell ,",
    "the main source of the error comes from the spurious long - range coulomb interactions between the defect charge , its periodic images and background charge ,  @xcite which is requisite for avoiding the divergence of the electrostatic energy .",
    "consequently , the formation energy slowly converges with the supercell size .",
    "a correction for image - charge interactions is therefore inevitable for evaluating the defect formation energy in the isolated limit unless the dielectric constant is large enough to screen the spurious interactions .",
    "in addition , since the average electrostatic potential in the entire supercell is conventionally set to zero within the momentum - space formalism , the eigenvalues are defined only up to an undetermined constant .",
    "@xcite whereas the total energy of a charge - neutral system is well defined , the charged system depends on the undetermined shift of the valence band maximum ( vbm ) .",
    "therefore , it has been believed that one needs to align the vbm in the calculations of charged defects to that of the pristine host for restoring physically meaningful formation energies .",
    "@xcite this is a so - called potential alignment correction .",
    "the formation energy of defect @xmath8 in charge state @xmath9 is estimated as  @xcite @xmath10 & = & \\bigl\\{e[d^q ] + e_{\\rm corr}[d^q]\\bigr\\ } - e_p -   \\sum n_i\\mu_i \\nonumber \\\\   & + & q \\bigl\\ { ( \\epsilon_{\\rm vbm}+\\delta v ) + \\delta\\epsilon_f \\bigr\\}. \\label{defect_formation_energy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath11 $ ] and @xmath12 are the total energies of the supercell with the defect @xmath8 in charge state @xmath9 and the perfect supercell without defect , respectively .",
    "@xmath13 is the number of removed ( @xmath13 @xmath14 0 ) or added ( @xmath13 @xmath15 0 ) @xmath16-type atom and @xmath17 refers to the chemical potential .",
    "@xmath18 is the energy level of the vbm , and @xmath19 is the fermi level referenced to @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath20 $ ] and @xmath21 , corresponding to the image - charge correction and potential alignment correction , respectively , are for charged defects .",
    "then @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) represents the fermi level .",
    "a number of image - charge correction schemes have been proposed since a few decades ago .",
    "@xcite the simplest correction is the point charge ( pc ) correction , which is a leading term for correcting spurious electrostatic interactions .",
    "unfortunately , in some cases the higher - order terms are not negligible , and then the defect formation energy has to be extrapolated to the infinite interdefect distance limit with a set of supercell calculations .",
    "this is , however , prohibited when computational costs severely limit the size of supercells as seen in hybrid functional calculations .",
    "recently , freysoldt , neugebauer , and van de walle ( fnv ) proposed a remarkable scheme , which allows us to correct the defect formation energies _ a posteriori_.  @xcite a great advantage of this scheme is to estimate a correction energy from two supercell calculations with and without a defect and require no additional first - principles calculations .",
    "therefore it is useful especially when computationally expensive methods are employed .",
    "this correction scheme , however , still has two practical issues .",
    "firstly , it uses planar - averaged electrostatic potential for aligning the defect - induced potential , which is obtained by subtracting bulk supercell potential from defective supercell potential , to the model charge potential .",
    "this works well when the atomic positions are fixed .",
    "however , realistic defect calculations require relaxing the atomic positions , and the defect - induced potential becomes scraggly because of the atomic displacements .",
    "consequently , the potential offset between defect - induced potential and model charge potential has to be determined , e.g. by convoluting the defect - induced potential with a suitable gaussian function .",
    "@xcite secondly , in the original paper , the long - range coulomb interaction is assumed to be screened by a macroscopic dielectric constant .",
    "this is valid only for cubic systems , and the dielectric constant should be replaced by a dielectric tensor for other systems . in order to resolve these two practical issues and make fnv scheme applicable to broad classes of materials , we use atomic site electrostatic potential for evaluating the defect - induced potential and an anisotropic pc model for long - range coulomb interactions .",
    "the extended fnv scheme is applied to the layered compounds , hexagonal bn ( h - bn ) and @xmath0-li@xmath1tio@xmath2 , as well as three - dimensional systems .",
    "details are discussed in sec .",
    "[ image ] .",
    "there also exist a wide variety of fashions for the potential alignment . in the most - used way",
    ", the potential is aligned so that the electrostatic potential at the outermost atomic sites in the supercell with a charged defect becomes the same as that of the bulk .",
    "@xcite instead , lany and zunger adopted the reference by averaging potential differences from the perfect cell at all atomic sites except the immediate neighbors of defects .",
    "@xcite taylor and bruneval , however , demonstrated that the madelung potential , which is taken into account by the first - order image - charge correction , brings a potential shift and one can not perform the image - charge correction and potential alignment independently .",
    "@xcite in order to remove the long - range coulomb interactions , komsa _",
    "et al_. proposed a way to align the potential at the outermost area of the _ neutral _ defect to that of the pristine bulk .",
    "@xcite taylor and bruneval also proposed to align the potential averaged over the entire supercell including exchange - correlation ( xc ) potential to the bulk potential .",
    "@xcite in sec .",
    "[ alignment_revisited ] , we revisit the controversial potential alignment , and conclude that the potential alignment is unnecessary ( @xmath24 ) as long as the image - charge correction is properly adopted .    to our best knowledge , the cell size dependence of the fnv correction for relaxed defects has been reported only by komsa _",
