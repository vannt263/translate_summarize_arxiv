    "black holes which are formed in the early universe are known as primordial black holes ( pbhs ) .",
    "these black holes are formed as a result of initial inhomogeneities [ 1,2 ] , inflation [ 3,4 ] , phase transitions [ 5 ] , bubble collisions [ 6,7 ] or the decay of cosmic loops [ 8 ] . in 1974 hawking discovered that the black holes emit thermal radiation due to quantum effects [ 9 ] . so the black holes get evaporated depending upon their masses .",
    "smaller the masses of the pbhs , quicker they evaporate .",
    "but the density of a black hole varies as inversely with it s mass .",
    "so high density is needed for forming lighter black holes . and such high densities is available only in the early universe .",
    "thus primordial black holes are the only black holes whose masses could be small enough to have evaporated by present time .",
    "further , pbhs could act as seeds for structure formation[10 ] and could also form a significant component of dark matter[11,12,13 ] .    using standard cosmology barrow and carr",
    "[ 14 ] have studied the evaporation of pbhs .",
    "they have , however , not included the effect of accretion of radiation which seems to play an important role .",
    "majumdar , das gupta and saxena [ 15 ] have solved the baryon asymmetry problem including accretion . in the present work ,",
    "we include accretion of radiation while studying the evaporation of pbhs and have shown that how evaporation times of pbhs change wih accretion efficiency .",
    "for a spatially flat(k=0 ) frw universe with scale factor @xmath0 , the einstein equation is [ 16 ] @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the density of the universe .",
    "+ the energy conservation equation is @xmath3 on assuming that the universe is filled with perfect fluid describrd by equation of state @xmath4 .the parameter @xmath5 is @xmath6 for radiation dominated era@xmath7 and is @xmath8 for matter dominated era@xmath9 , where time @xmath10 marks the end of the radiation dominated era @xmath11 sec .",
    "+ now equation(2 ) gives @xmath12 using this solution in equation(1 ) , one gets the wellknown temporal behaviour of the scale factor @xmath13 as @xmath14    due to hawking evaporation , the rate at which the pbh mass ( m ) decreases is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 black hole radius=@xmath17 with g as newton s gravitational constant . + @xmath18 black body constant + @xmath19 and@xmath20 hawking temperature=@xmath21 .",
    "+ now equation ( 4 ) becomes @xmath22 integrating the above equation , we get @xmath23^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 .",
    "when a pbh passes through radiation dominated era , the accretion of radiation leads to increase of its mass with the rate given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the radiation energy density of the sorrounding of the black hole=@xmath27 and @xmath28 is the accretion efficiency .",
    "the value of the accretion efficiency @xmath28 depends upon complex physical processes such as the mean free paths of the particles comprising the radiation sorrounding the pbhs .",
    "any peculiar velocity of the pbh with respect to the cosmic frame could increase the value of @xmath28 [ 15,17 ] .",
    "since the precise value of @xmath28 is unknown , it is customary [ 18 ] to take the accretion rate to be proportional to the product of the surface area of the pbh and the energy density of radiation with @xmath29 . + after substituting the expressions for @xmath30 and",
    "@xmath31 equation(7 ) becomes @xmath32 using equation(3 ) , we get @xmath33 on integration , the above eqution gives @xmath34^{-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the variation of accreting mass with time for different @xmath28 is shown in figure-1 .",
    "+        from figure-1 , it is cleared that the mass of the pbh increases with accretion efficiency .",
    "+ now equation(10 ) gives @xmath35 but horizon mass varies with @xmath36 as @xmath37 .",
    "+ so @xmath38 but for accretion to become effective , horizon mass @xmath39 must grow faster than black hole mass @xmath40 which implies ( @xmath41 ) is a positive quantity .",
    "+ hence equation(12 ) demands ( @xmath42 ) is a positive quantity which gives @xmath43 the behaviour of horizon mass @xmath44 and primordial black hole mass is shown in figure-2 .",
    "having @xmath45 and @xmath44 with @xmath36 ]",
    "primordial black holes , as discussed before , are only formed in radiation dominated era .",
    "so depending on their evaporation , we can divide pbhs into 2 categories .",
    "+ ( i ) pbhs evaporated in radiation dominated era @xmath7 + ( ii ) pbhs evaporated in matter dominated era @xmath9 . +",
    "* case - i * @xmath7 + black hole evaporation equation ( 6 ) implies @xmath47^\\frac{1}{3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we consider both evaporation and accretion simultaneously , then the rate at which primordial black hole mass changes is given by @xmath48 this equation can nt be solved analytically .",
    "so we have solved it by using numerical methods .",
    "+ ( for our calculation purpose , we have used @xmath49 and @xmath50 . )",
    "+ for a given @xmath51 the equation(14 ) and the solution of the equation(15 ) are shown in figure-3 .",
    "+    ]    figure-3 clearly shows that the evaporation time of pbh increases with accretion efficiency . + * case - ii * @xmath9 + since there is no accretion in matter dominated era , so the first term in the combined equation ( 15 ) for variation of @xmath52 with time needs to be integrated only upto @xmath10 .",
    "+ based on numerical solution with above provision , we construct the following table-1 for the pbhs which are evaporated today i.e. @xmath53 . + @xmath54table-1 +     @xmath28 & @xmath55 & @xmath51 + @xmath8 & @xmath56s & @xmath57 g + @xmath58 & @xmath59s & @xmath60 g + @xmath61 & @xmath62s & @xmath63 g + @xmath64 & @xmath65s & @xmath66 g + @xmath67 & @xmath68s & @xmath69 g + @xmath70 & @xmath71s & @xmath72 g + @xmath73 & @xmath74s & @xmath75 g +",
    "the fraction of the universe s mass going into pbhs at time @xmath36 is [ 2 ] @xmath76(1+z)^{-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 is the density parameter associated with pbhs formed at time @xmath36 , @xmath78 is the redshift associated with time @xmath36 and @xmath79 is the microwave background density having value @xmath80 . + again for @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "+ so @xmath83 again using @xmath84 , we can write the fraction of the universe going into pbhs of mass m is @xmath85 observations of the cosmolgical deceleration parameter imply @xmath86 over all mass ranges for which pbhs have not evaporated .",
    "but presently evaporating pbhs(@xmath87 ) generate a @xmath5-ray background whose most of the energy is appearing at around 100 mev[19 ] .",
    "if the fraction of the emitted energy which goes into photons is @xmath88 , then the density of the radiation at this energy is expected to be @xmath89 . since @xmath90 and the observed @xmath5-ray background density around @xmath91 mev is @xmath92",
    ", we infer @xmath93 .",
    "+ now equation ( 18 ) becomes @xmath94 the variation of @xmath95 with @xmath28 drawn from variation of @xmath87 with @xmath28 is shown in the following table-2 .",
    "@xmath96table-2 +     @xmath28 & @xmath87 & @xmath97 + @xmath8 & @xmath98 g & @xmath99 + @xmath61 & @xmath100 g & @xmath101 + @xmath67 & @xmath102 g & @xmath103 + @xmath73 & @xmath104 g & @xmath105 + @xmath106 & @xmath107 g & @xmath108 + @xmath109 & @xmath110 g & @xmath111 +",
    "if we consider only evaporation then the primordial black holes which are created on or before @xmath112 sec are completely evaporated by present time .",
    "however , we found that if we include accretion , then the primotdial black holes which are created on @xmath56sec will live longer depending on accretion efficiency .",
    "we also concluded that accretion efficiency can not exceed @xmath113 .",
    "further , our analysis imposes constraint on the fraction of the universe s mass going into pbhs which is consistent with previous results [ 20,21,22 ] that @xmath114 .",
    "thus accretion increases the number of existing pbhs depending on accretion efficiency , which helps in considering pbh as the proper candidate for dark matter .",
    "we , thus , provide within standard cosmology a possible realisation of the speculation advanced earlier [ 11,12,13 ] .",
