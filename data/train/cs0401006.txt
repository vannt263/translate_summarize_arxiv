    "the processors virtualization technology permits to split a real physical processor into two virtual chips , so that the operating system , as ms windows or linux , of a computer can use the virtual processors as two real chips .",
    "example of such technology is intel s hyper threading [ 1 ] .",
    "the hardware can so be considered as a symmetric multi - processor machine and the software can use it as a true parallel environment .    in this work",
    "i show some results obtained with parallel computations using matlab [ 2 ] programs on intel technology .",
    "a previous paper [ 3 ] describes the same cases for an older matlab version and for a single dual processor machine .",

    "from the results of the previous section , i deduce the following observations : +    1 .   the case _ _",

    "nproc__=4 , the number of physical processors in the cluster , has a local peak of performances for all the values of the _ m _ parameter ; 3 .",
    "the speedup [ 6 ] seems to be better for increasing values of the parameter _ m _",
    ", hence for larger amount of data to be computed ; in the case _ _ m__=2 the speedup of 8 running processes over the case of 2 processes is about 2.14 , while in the case _ _ m__=6 the same speedup is about 3.35 ( quasi - linear speedup ) .",

    "the peaks of performances at _ _ nproc__=4 and _ _ nproc__=8 are well visible , specially in the case _ _ m__=6 .",
    "+          from the previous facts one can deduce that a virtual processors technology as hyper threading on a cluster environment can be a good choice for running spmd programs in the case that    * the number of parallel processes is equal to the number of virtual processors ; * the data to be computed have a large amount , particularly when their distribution among processes and the merging of final results are based on files stored on fast storage system .",
