    "we summarize and conclude in the last section .",
    "some calculational details are relegated to the appendix .",
    "as we are interested essentially in @xmath1-sector observables , we begin by introducing generic four - fermion operators involving the @xmath1 quark , given by , [ eq : o_fb_gen ] where @xmath43 is a dimensionless number which is _ a priori _ undetermined and can only be fixed with a knowledge of the full theory .",

    "it should be appreciated that , had we attempted instead to calculate the effective @xmath59 vertex , the very form of the corresponding @xmath60 would have ensured that the charge radius does not receive any correction .",

    "if the scale @xmath44 of new physics is to be substantially larger than the electroweak symmmetry breaking scale ( as the absence of any new resonances at the lhc seems to suggest ) , the four - fermion operators need to respect the full @xmath62 symmetry .",

    "this , though , would be tantamount to invoking two new operators to explain two discrepancies , and , hence , we desist from exploring this alternative any further .",
    "it is obvious that the operator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : o_tb_rr ] ) also modifies the @xmath86 coupling , with the @xmath1 now in the loop . however probing this effect presents a bigger challenge .",

    "[ sec : introduction ] , apart from the @xmath1-sector , some minor discrepancies also exist in the @xmath13-sector in the lep data .",

    "on the other hand , the disagreements between data and sm predictions are smaller in the case of the @xmath13 observables .",
    "hence , with @xmath90 alone , it is not possible to simultaeously generate the requisite corrections to all of @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "if one were to additionally consider @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 as well , it is indeed possible to arrange a conspiracy between the coefficients of the various operators such that the observed values of the all couplings are obtained simultaneously .",
    "an easier path to such an explanation is offered by invoking a ( set of ) @xmath104 operators alongwith @xmath105 .",
    "this has the advantage of not upsetting any other low - energy observable to a significant degree . on the other hand ,",
    "it is a construction that is barely testable in current experiments .",
    "a much more intriguing possibility is offered where @xmath45 ( in eq .",
    "( [ eq : o_fb_gen ] ) ) is an exotic fermion .",
    "clearly , few constraints apply to such operators , and it is much easier to arrange for the requisite shifts in @xmath106 as long as @xmath45 itself does couple to the @xmath3 .",
    "this is eminently possible , as for example in supersymmetric or extra - dimensional extensions of the sm . while many different choices for @xmath45 are possible ( as long as it is heavy enough not to have been found at the tevatron or the lhc )",

    "the tantalizing indications , over the years , for the existence of a dm particle ( whether it be from cosmological data fitting , indirect evidence from satellite - based observations or direct earth - bound experiments ) , in the absence of actual discovery , has led to much speculation about its nature .",
    "it has been realized of late that , quite apart from dedicated dm search experiments , collider experiments can provide substantial information about the dm sector .",
    "indeed , given the complete absence of any information , even dedicated dm searches only parametrize its interactions with matter through effective operators as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : o_fb_gen ] ) .",
    "the very same operators would also lead to dm pair production ( in association with visible objects ) at colliders .",
    "thus , an excess in such channels ( with the dm pair providing missing momentum ) over the sm expectations would constitute a signal while a lack thereof would constrain the said interactions  @xcite .",
    "the situation becomes particularly interesting if the dm particle couples to the sm sector preferentially through the third generation fermions  @xcite .",
    "direct detection experiments would be rendered rather ineffectual .",
    "even satellite - based indirect detection experiments would have reduced sensitivity .",

    "the last mentioned is of particular relevance here as the @xmath1-flux is relatively poorly known .",
    "one might attempt to exploit the fact that owing to the higher - dimensional nature of the interaction term , the corresponding amplitude grows with energy . while this is certainly true at the subprocess level , the growth of the anomalous cross - section is muted owing to the rapid fall of the @xmath1-flux with bjorken-@xmath113 .",

    "it turns out that there is a significant region in the parameter space that is consistent with the @xmath4 and @xmath2 data , without being in contradiction with other observables .",
    "finally , we look for the possible signals of this operator at the lhc .",
    "altough @xmath109 is the lowest order process that features the new coupling , given the experimental as well as theoretical uncertainities , the sensitivity is likely to be low . on the other hand , @xmath129 is far amenable to this task .",
    "we find that several observables would show a clear deviation from the sm , thus opening up clear channels to investigate such interactions .",
    "the results will be eagerly anticipated . _",
    "note added : _ recently freitas and huang @xcite have revised their two - loop calculation of @xmath4 and @xmath130 . as a result",
    "the discrepancy between the sm expectations and the experimental value has again come down to @xmath131 .",
    "if it stands , this result would serve to restrict the parameter space for the higher - dimensional effective operators .",
    "however , even the remaining part of the parameter space would still be of great interest in the context of the lhc as well as the paradigm of non - linear realization of the electroweak symmetry . moreover , if the anomaly in @xmath4 indeed disappears after the inclusion of two - loop effects , then it leaves the heavy quark sector in a rather intriguing position .",
    "it appears now that , for third - generation quarks , production cross - sections agree with sm predictions but @xmath38 measurements do not .",
    "this throws up interesting possibilities and is sure to spur futher activity in this area in the near future .",
    "we parametrize the @xmath54 vertex within the standard model by @xmath132 the one - loop correction to this vertex on account of the interaction of eqn.([eq : o_fb_gen ] ) is given by the diagram of fig.[fig : zbb_eff_labels ] .",
    "the expression for the corresponding correction is given by [ |b _ ( v_b+ a_b_5 ) b ] ^ where ^ = - .",
    "the evaluation of this integral is best done by ignoring the higher - dimensional nature of the coupling and the possible role of @xmath44 as a cutoff . treating ( @xmath112 ) just as a dimensionful parameter in the theory , we employ dimensional regularization and the finite part of the correction is given by ( note that @xmath133 denotes the presence of a threshold ) @xmath134 with @xmath135 \\nonumber \\\\ & & -    { m_f}^2 \\ ; ( { { \\cal a}_+}-{{\\cal a}_- } ) \\ ;   \\left [ \\ln\\left(\\frac{{m_f}^2}{\\lambda^2}\\right ) \\;-\\ 2 \\ ; + \\ ; 4\\sqrt{\\chi } \\ ;   \\tan^{-1}\\left ( \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{\\chi}}\\right ) \\right]\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath136 in other words , on the inclusion of np , @xmath137 or , in terms of @xmath37 and @xmath34 , @xmath138    a couple of points need to be noted here .",
    "had we employed a naive cut - off regularization instead , we would have encountered a quadratic divergence instead of the logarithmic one present in @xmath60 .",
    "this , however , would have been a spurious one occasioned by the facts that the loop integral is a tensorial one and that the naive cut - off regularization does not respect the symmetries of the theory  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the adoption of such a regularization would have induced anomalous corrections to the ( chromo-)electric charge radius of the @xmath1 and the @xmath139 , thereby violating gauge invariance . on the other hand , had we used a gauge and lorentz - invariant prescription such as the pauli - villars scheme , we would have obtained a term exactly analogous to that we already have , achieved though after a much more tedious calculation .",
    "a further issue relates to our implicit equalization of the renormalization scale @xmath140 with @xmath44 . while this choice is a natural one",
    ", it is by no means the only possible one .",
    "note , though , that the additional term introduced by using @xmath141 is a subdominant one and of little consequence here .",
