    "there has been a great deal of interest and activity in the last two years on the possibility that there may be one or more extra space dimensions in nature which have sizes of order of a millimeter@xcite .",
    "this has been driven by the realization that string theories provide a completely new way to view a multidimensional space time in terms of a brane - bulk picture , where a brane is lower dimensional space - time manifold that contains known matter and forces and the bulk consists of the brane plus the rest of space dimensions where only gravity is present .",
    "the resulting picture replaces planck scale by the string scale as the new fundamental scale beyond the standard model .",
    "the relation between the familiar planck scale and the string scale @xmath0 is given by the formula@xcite @xmath1 for @xmath2 and @xmath3 , this relation leads to @xmath4 millimeter for @xmath5tev .",
    "the fact that the familiar inverse square law of gravity allows for the existence of such sub - millimeter size extra dimensions made these models interesting for phenomenology@xcite .",
    "an added attraction was the fact that a whole new set of particles are present at the tev scale making such theories accessible to collider tests .",
    "furthermore since there are no high scales in the theory , there is no hierarchy problem between the weak and the planck scale ; this provided an alternative approach ( resolution ? ) to the familiar gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "obviously , the picture would become much more interesting if collider experiments such as those planned at lhc or tevatron fail to reveal any evidence for supersymmetry .    even though these models present an attractive alternative to the standard grand unification scenarios , there are two arenas where the simplest tev string scale , large extra dimension models lead to problems : ( i ) one has to do with understanding neutrino masses and ( ii ) second is in the domain of cosmology and astrophysics .",
    "the reason for the first is that the smallness of neutrino masses is generally thought to be understood via the seesaw mechanism@xcite , the fundamental requirement of which is the existence of a scale @xmath6 or @xmath7 gev , if the neutrino masses are in the sub ev range .",
    "clearly this is a much higher scale than @xmath0 of the tev scale models .",
    "a second problem is that if one considers only the standard model group on the brane , operators such as @xmath8 could be induced by string theory in the low energy effective lagrangian . for tev scale strings",
    "this would obviously lead to unacceptable neutrino masses .    in the domain of cosmology",
    ", the problems are related to the existence of the kaluza - klein ( kk ) tower of gravitons generally which lead to overclosure of the universe unless the highest temperature of the universe is about an mev@xcite .",
    "this can not only cause potential problems with big bang nucleosynthesis but also with understanding of the origin of matter , inflation etc .",
    "there are also arguments based on sn1987a observations that require that @xmath9 tev@xcite .",
    "the neutrino mass problem was realized early on and a simple solution was proposed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the suggestion was to postulate the existence of one or more gauge singlet neutrinos , @xmath10 , in the bulk which couple to the lepton doublets in the brane .",
    "we will call this the bulk neutrino .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking , this coupling can lead to neutrino dirac masses , which are of order @xmath11 .",
    "this leads to @xmath12 ev .",
    "the dominant nonrenormalizable terms have to be forbidden in this model . the simple way to accomplish",
    "this is to assume the existence of a global b - l symmetry in the theory .",
    "the only difficulty with this assumption is that string theories are not supposed to have any global symmetries and one has to find a way to generate an effective b - l symmetry at low energies without putting it in at the beginning .",
    "there is an alternative scenario for neutrino masses@xcite , where one abandons the tev string scale but maintains one large extra dimension and avoids the problem associated with nonrenormalizable operators .",
    "the relation in eq .",
    "( 1 ) then gets modified to the form @xmath13 since the string scale in these models is in the intermediate range i.e. @xmath14 gev or so , the cosmological overclosure problem is avoided .",
    "the active neutrino masses in such models could arise from seesaw mechanism or from the presence of bulk neutrinos .",
    "the inclusion of the bulk neutrino however brings in new neutrinos into the theory which can be ultralight ( i.e. @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the size of the large extra dimension ) and can play the role of the sterile neutrino , which may be required e.g. if the lsnd results are confirmed .",
    "both the above approaches have the common feature that they introduce a bulk neutrino into the theory , which is equivalent in the brane to an infinite tower of sterile neutrinos .",
    "all of these neutrino modes mix with the active neutrinos in the process of mass generation@xcite . for extra dimension size of order @xmath17 mm ,",
    "the kk modes have masses typically of order @xmath18 ev or so , where @xmath19 .",
    "the presence of this dense tower of extra sterile states coupled to the known neutrinos leads to a variety of new effects in the domain of particle physics@xcite and cosmology@xcite , which in turn impose constraints on the allowed size of the extra dimensions . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the cosmological constraints that may arise from the contribution of the neutrino states to big bang nucleosynthesis .    the constraints from big bang nucleosynthesis on bulk neutrinos were considered in ref.@xcite , where the cases of @xmath20 2 extra dimensions were discussed . as it was noted there , light kk modes of the bulk neutrinos",
    "could easily be produced in the early universe , when temperature is of order an mev or more .",
    "thus , there is the danger that they could make large contribution to the energy density of the universe at the epoch of big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) and completely destroy our current , successful understanding of the primordial abundance of @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23@xcite . in particular , present abundance data from metal poor stars",
    "is well understood provided we do not have more than one extra active neutrino in the theory in addition to the three known ones i.e. @xmath24 . by the same token , if there are extra species of neutrinos that do not have conventional weak interactions , their masses and mixings to known neutrinos must obey severe constraints@xcite .    our goal in this paper is to revisit this issue in the context of models with only one large extra dimension .",
    "the first reason for undertaking this analysis is that the class of models with intermediate string scale @xmath25 gev and one large extra dimension@xcite have certain theoretical advantages and they are also free of the cosmological and astrophysical problems that seem to plague the tev scale models . secondly , the number of kk modes in this case are much fewer than models with larger number of large extra dimensions and therefore , one would expect the constraints to be somewhat less restrictive .",
    "we also wish to emphasize that one large extra dimension could also occur in models with string scale in the 100 tev range , where one can satisfy the planck - scale - string - scale relation in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , if the compactification is not isotropic , e.g. for a string scale of 100 tev , if two extra dimensions have sizes @xmath26 gev@xmath27 and one has @xmath28 millimeter , i.e. @xmath29 .",
    "we organize this paper as follows : in sec ii , we discuss the constraints of big bang nucleosynthesis on the size of the extra dimension in the presence of the bulk neutrino and the mixing of the bulk neutrino to the active one using simple out of equilibrium condition .",
    "in section iii , we use boltzman equation to study the generation of the bulk neutrinos from active neutrino interactions in the early universe and find the constraint of bbn on the same parameters as in sec .",
    "the numerical calculations leading to our final results are given in sec.iv . in appendix",
    "a , we explain the details of the out of equilibrium condition for the kk modes of the neutrino .",
    "the class of models , we will be interested in , are assumed to have one large extra dimension with a single bulk neutrino @xmath10 , which means that masses of the kk modes of @xmath10 are integer multiples of the basic scale @xmath30 ev .",
    "this is one of the parameters that we expect the bbn discussion to constrain .",
    "the second parameter is the mixing of the kk modes with the active brane neutrinos , e.g. @xmath31 .",
    "it is true in both classes of models i.e. both tev and intermediate scale type,@xcite that the typical mixing parameter of the active neutrino to the nth kk mode scales like @xmath32 , in the range of interest for phenomenology .",
    "the parameter @xmath33 depends on the size of the extra dimension and other parameters of the theory such as the weak scale etc .",
    "for instance , in tev scale models@xcite , one has @xmath34 , whereas in the local b - l models , the relation is @xmath35 , where we have chosen @xmath36 . in general , therefore , bbn discussion will give a correlated constraint between @xmath37 and @xmath33 .",
    "obviously , for @xmath38 , there is no bbn constraint on @xmath37 or the size of the extra dimension .",
    "we will also assume that the universe starts its `` big bang journey '' somewhere around a gev or so and when it starts , the universe is essentially swept clean of the sterile neutrino modes .",
    "this can happen in inflation models with a low reheat temperature .",
    "we choose such a low reheat temperature essentially for reasons that in models with large extra dimensions higher temperatures would lead to closure due to production of graviton kk modes .    to see the origin of constraints , let us note that at high temperatures ( i.e. @xmath39 mev s ) , there are two ways the kk modes of the sterile bulk neutrino can be created : ( i ) first , neutrino scattering and annihilations and ( ii ) the oscillation of the active neutrinos into the sterile kk modes .",
    "it is important to stress that in building up the oscillation , the scattering process is important , since otherwise there will be back - and - forth oscillation and no build - up of the sterile modes .    since there is an infinite kk tower of these neutrino modes , the higher the temperature the larger the number of modes that can get created .",
    "once these modes are created , they may decay or annihilate to produce the lighter particles ( lighter neutrino modes or kk modes of the graviton etc ) .",
    "in general , it is reasonable to expect that this process of decay or annihilation will not be efficient enough@xcite to eliminate all the kk modes . as a result ,",
    "many of them will stay around at the bbn temperature and contribute to the energy density .",
    "the present understanding of the big bang nucleosynthesis@xcite relies on the assumption that the total energy density at the bbn era is @xmath40 with @xmath41 coming from the contribution of photon , @xmath42 , and the three species of neutrinos .",
    "the uncertainties in our knowledge of the @xmath21 , @xmath43 and @xmath23 content of the universe allow that one could have @xmath44 ( or one extra species of neutrino ) .",
    "we will require that any additional contribution to @xmath45 coming from the bulk neutrinos generated at higher temperature be less than the contribution to @xmath45 equivalent to one extra species of neutrino .",
    "the first step to ensure this would be to enforce the condition that the production rate for any singer bulk neutrino mode is less than the hubble expansion rate of the universe between 1 gev to mev .",
    "this will prevent any bulk neutrino mode from equilibrium .",
    "the equilibration of any neutrino mode is unacceptable because it can contribute more than allowed energy density to the universe .",
    "clearly this condition can not be a completely reliable method of constraining the parameter space when there are such a large number of final states present since a small oscillation into each mode can ruin bbn results .",
    "however , we use this as a `` warm up '' to our final ( hopefully more refined treatment ) and as a basic guideline for more precise and stronger condition .",
    "we present the details of this discussion and its results in this section fully realizing that this is not going to be the `` final story '' .",
    "our next step to obtain constraints is to use the boltzman equations for the time evolution of the density of the kk modes and obtain their contributions to the energy density at the bbn era and demand that this energy density is less than that of one extra species of neutrino .",
    "we will discuss this in the next section .",
    "we find it intriguing that both these methods lead to bounds which are very close to each other .",
    "we begin with some pedagogical comments by considering one sterile mode which mixes with one of the active neutrinos and by ignoring the matter effects .",
    "we present this discussion as a way to appreciate the importance of the matter effects . in this simple case ,",
    "it turns out that it is the oscillations rather than direct production in scattering that give the strongest bound@xcite .    to see that direct production is not so important , note that the the production rate for the nth kk mode is roughly given by @xmath46 .",
    "note that dependence on the mode number cancels out . setting this @xmath47 the hubble expansion rate",
    ", we get , for the decoupling temperature @xmath48 . thus below this temperature all production processes for arbitrary modes",
    "are far out of equilibrium .",
    "thus we only have to consider @xmath10 production through oscillations .",
    "the transition rate to one sterile ( or kk ) mode from oscillation in the absence of matter effect can be estimated as follows : the oscillation is a quantum mechanical phenomenon that gets interrupted as soon as a collision takes place .",
    "the amount of time which allows a build up of the oscillation to the sterile state is therefore given by the time between the collisions @xmath49 i.e. inverse of the collision rate , @xmath50 .",
    "the probability for transition to a sterile mode in time @xmath51 is given by @xmath52 where oscillation time @xmath53 .",
    "if time between collisions of the @xmath31 , denoted by @xmath54 , is much less than the oscillation time , this expression is simplified and we get the production rate for the sterile kk modes @xmath55 this condition i.e. @xmath56 is satisfied around 2 - 3 mev for @xmath57 ev .",
    "below this temperature we must approximate the oscillation factor by 1/2 .",
    "staying above 3 mev and ignoring the matter effects , we can implement the bbn constraint by requiring that the production rate for a kk mode be less than the hubble expansion rate at a given epoch : @xmath58 if a given kk mode is much lighter than an mev , we get the bound in literature@xcite that @xmath59    taking matter effects into account essentially amounts to replacing the vacuum mixing angle by the matter mixing angle @xmath60 given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 for the @xmath63-th kk mode@xcite .",
    "we have assumed that there is no lepton asymmetry .",
    "clearly @xmath64 is a function of temperature .",
    "note that @xmath65 is always negative .",
    "this means that there is no resonance type behavior for the mixing angle , which makes the calculation more reliable .",
    "the out of equilibrium condition in the presence of matter effect is given by : @xmath66 where all mass parameters are in units of gev ; @xmath67 is the kk scale , discussed before .",
    "this condition must be satisfied for all @xmath63 and within our temperature window of one mev to one gev .",
    "we include the detail analysis of this part in appendix a. for @xmath68 fixed , the equation has to be satisfied when the expression in the left hand side of the above expression is a maximum .",
    "this occurs when @xmath69 for @xmath70 . for @xmath71 ,",
    "the maximum occurs when @xmath72 . in the first case",
    ", we get the limit , @xmath73 the best bound arises when @xmath74 is minimum consistent with the condition @xmath75 or equivalently @xmath76 in the second case , we get the limit , @xmath77 the best bound arises when @xmath74 is maximum consistent with the condition @xmath71 or equivalently @xmath78 the temperature should also be within our chosen window of one mev to gev .",
    "this gives rise to three cases . to see the various cases , let us define the temperature @xmath79 .",
    "the various cases then correspond to ( i ) @xmath80 mev ; ( ii ) gev @xmath81 ; ( iii ) mev @xmath82 gev .",
    "the limits for various cases are found to be as follows : +   + ( i ) in this case @xmath83 lies in the range @xmath84 + and the constraint on @xmath85 is given by @xmath86 as @xmath85 is less than 1 , this imposes no further constraint on our parameter space .",

    ", @xmath219 oscillates so fast that in calculating the maximum , we can set @xmath220 and finding the maximum of @xmath221 .",
    "the maximum is found at @xmath222 .",
    "@xmath222 implies @xmath223 . because @xmath63 must be positive integer",
    ", we should choose @xmath63 equal to the closest integer of @xmath224 if @xmath225 . for @xmath226",
    ", since @xmath227c and it is easy to see that the maximum occurs at the minimum of y , @xmath72 is the maximum point .",
    "it is worth noting that , the condition have to be satisfied within a range of temperature ( and so a continuous range of @xmath155).although at some temperature with a well chosen @xmath37 , the constraint can be weaker than those we use , small range of temperature of mev will cover the period of @xmath219 .",
    "so the constraint will be that obtained just by setting @xmath228 .",
    "now we discuss the two different cases separately .",
    "+ ( i ) for @xmath229.we have constraint @xmath230 ( ii ) for @xmath231 .",
    "we have constraint @xmath232 in case 2 , we have approximate @xmath233 . without making this approximation , the result will give approximately a factor of 2 to @xmath85 .",
    "under this approximation , three different situation appear .",
    "they are ( i ) @xmath234 , ( ii ) @xmath235 ev@xmath88,(iii ) @xmath236 ev@xmath88 .",
    "+ ( i ) @xmath237    we have to use eq.([alpha1 ] ) with @xmath238 and @xmath239 . this will give @xmath240 ( ii)@xmath241    we have to use eq.([alpha1 ] ) for t @xmath242 and use eq.([alpha2 ] ) for t @xmath243 with @xmath244 for both cases .",
    "this gives respectively @xmath245 and @xmath246 it is easy to see that even without the approximation that @xmath247 , the second equation can go up as high as @xmath248 when @xmath249 .",
    "it is still more stringent than the first.we use the second equation with @xmath250 .",
    "this will at most give another factor @xmath251 which depend on @xmath37 .",
    "+ ( iii)@xmath252    use eq.([alpha2 ] ) with @xmath253 and gives @xmath254 note that we have omitted the change of the @xmath148 due to the matter effect which will only increase the @xmath148 as our z is always negative .",
    "increasing @xmath148 will increase the frequency the the oscillation term @xmath219 and make it easier to be set to 1 .",
