    "during the last decade , the problem of the description of hadrons in dense and hot nuclear matter received great attention .",
    "it is well known that particles change their properties when they are placed into a medium . already in the seventies",
    "the reduction of the nucleon masses in nuclei was implemented into the walecka model in the framework of effective hadron field theory @xcite . later on this effect",
    "was put on firmer grounds on the basis of a partial restoration of chiral symmetry and finite - density qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "the change of the meson properties is also discussed in the quantum hadrodynamics @xcite and finite - density qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "the investigations in the nambu - jona - lasinio model provide an evidence for reduction of nucleon and meson masses at finite density and temperature as well @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , many - body correlations lead to a dressing of the particles inside the medium and strongly modify spectral properties of the mesons @xcite .",
    "thus one expects a significant reduction of the corresponding life times which , loosely speaking , result in melting the mesons in the nuclear environment .",
    "the melting of the higher nucleon resonances is established experimentally from the measurement of the total photoabsorption cross section on heavy nuclei @xcite .",
    "there is a clear signal for a change of the shape of the @xmath3-resonance in nuclei , related to the fermi motion and , as noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite , to the collision broadening effect discussed first by weisskopf @xcite in connection with a broadening of the atomic spectral lines in gases .",
    "the higher nucleon resonances are not seen in the cross section due to a strong collision broadening effect .",
    "the purpose of the current investigations is to determine mass shifts and the broadening of hadronic resonances in nuclear matter .",
    "the formulation of this problem can be traced back to the atomic spectroscopy where the shifts of atomic energy levels and the broadening of atomic spectral lines in dense and hot gases is a relatively well studied subject ( see _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the search for signatures of modified hadron properties such as reduction masses according to the brown - rho scaling @xcite are presently pursued with high experimental efforts",
    ". however , most hadronic probes loose important information on the early and violent phase of the reaction by strong final state interactions . one of the most promising probes to study in - medium properties of vector mesons are dilepton pairs @xmath4 ( @xmath5 @xmath6 ) which are produced from decays of @xmath7- , @xmath8- , and @xmath9-mesons in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the leptonic probes have the advantage that they are the nearly undistorted messengers from the conditions at their creation , unlike _",
    "e.g. _ pions .",
    "the dilepton spectra measured by the ceres and helios-3 collaborations at cern sps have attracted special interest @xcite .",
    "compared to theoretical predictions , both experiments found a significant enhancement of the low - energy dilepton yield below the @xmath10 and @xmath8 peaks .",
    "one way to explain this low - energy dilepton excess is to assume the scenario of a significant reduction of the @xmath10-meson mass in a dense medium @xcite . on the other hand , a more sophisticated treatment of the @xmath10-meson spectral function which includes",
    "the broadening in dense matter @xcite seems also to be sufficient to account for these data @xcite .",
    "an excess of low - energy dileptons occurs already at moderate bombarding energies .",
    "however , the spectra obtained by the dls collaboration at the bevalac @xcite for the incident energies around @xmath11 @xmath12gev can not be reproduced by present transport calculations @xcite . even using the reduction of the @xmath10-meson mass",
    ", there remains a discrepancy for the dilepton yield by a factor of @xmath13 to @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "also the medium dependence of the spectral function , even in combination with a dropping @xmath10 mass , does not provide an explanation for this so called dls puzzle @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that this fact is independent on the system size and occurs in light ( @xmath15 ) as well as in heavier systems ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the dilepton yield in elementary @xmath17 collisions measured by the dls collaboration @xcite is also underestimated by standard theoretical descriptions @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was claimed that the discrepancy between the dls data and theoretical simulations disappears if additional background contributions from dilepton decays of higher nucleon resonances ( mainly @xmath18 ) are taken into account .",
    "this demonstrates that a most precise knowledge of the background is indispensable for the interpretation of the present and future dilepton data .",
    "the hades experiment at gsi , germany , will focus on these topics to a large extent @xcite .",
    "while the dilepton spectra stemming from the mesonic decays are not distorted by final state interactions , the problem of extracting information on the in - medium properties of the vector mesons is a specific theoretical task , due to a large amount of decays contributing to the background .",
    "a precise and rather complete knowledge of the relative weights for existing decay channels is therefore indispensable in order to draw reliable conclusions from dilepton spectra .",
    "the study of the dilepton decays is useful also for the search on the dilepton decay modes of the light unflavored mesons .",
    "these decays give a deeper insight into meson structure , allowing to measure transition form factors at the time - like ( resonance ) region . in four - body",
    "decays the decay probabilities are determined by the half - off - shell meson transition form factors which can not be measured in other reactions .",
    "there are plans to study the @xmath19 transition form factors in the space - like region in reactions of the photo- and electroproduction at cebaf energies @xcite .",
    "recently , the dls collaboration published data on the dilepton production in the elementary @xmath20 and @xmath21 collisions @xcite .",
    "these data are analyzed in refs . @xcite .",
    "the plans from the hades collaboration include measurements of the dilepton spectra from proton - proton and pion - proton collisions @xcite .",
    "these experiments are stimulated by the already mentioned discrepancy between the number of the observed dilepton events and results of the transport simulations , that indicate a limited understanding of the mechanism for the dilepton emission in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "in such experiments , there is a possibility for exclusive measurements of the different mesonic channels .    in the present work ,",
    "we perform a detailed study of possible mesonic @xmath22 decays which appear in the sis energy range , _",
    "i.e. _ at lab",
    ". energies below @xmath13 gev / nucleon . at @xmath13",
    "gev / nucleon , the @xmath10-meson is produced slightly above the threshold . due to statistical fluctuations , the production of heavier mesons is , however , also possible .",
    "we consider decays of unflavored light mesons with masses below the @xmath23-meson mass within the framework of the effective meson theory .",
    "the vertex couplings are determined from the measured strong and radiative decay widths and , when the experimental data are not available , from @xmath24 symmetry . the transition form factors entering the decay rates are calculated using the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) model . in this way , we achieve generally good agreement with the experimental branching ratios for radiative meson decays . for the dilepton decay",
    "modes the branching ratios are , however , only known in a few cases .",
    "we consider the vector mesons @xmath10 , @xmath8 , and @xmath23 ( @xmath25 ) , the pseudo - scalar mesons @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath19 ( @xmath28 ) , and the scalar mesons @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the various decay modes can systematically be classified as follows : ( i ) there are , first of all , the direct decays modes @xmath32 , which contain the information on the in - medium vector meson masses . in the next sect . , some useful relations which simplify calculations of the decay rates to final states with a dilepton pair are derived . in sect.3",
    "we make a few remarks on the direct decay modes .",
    "there exits then a large number of processes which mask the vector meson peaks and which should be treated as a background .",
    "( ii )  these are dalitz decays of pseudoscalar mesons @xmath33 and scalar mesons @xmath34 .",
    "these decays are discussed in sect.4 .",
    "( iii ) one has also dalitz decays with one meson in the final states @xmath35 and @xmath36 , which we discuss in sect .",
    "the radiative decays of these mesons are well studied both from the theoretical and experimental points of view .",
    "the uncertainties in the estimates for the dilepton decays are connected with the lack of experimental information on the transition form factors .",
    "constructing the vmd model transition form factors , we take special care of the quark counting rules .",
