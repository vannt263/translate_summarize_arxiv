    "a net exposure of 0.61 ms was obtained on the source .",
    "the highest accessible psd frequency of the source intensity variation ( i.e. , the nyquist frequency ) was determined from the time resolution of the lightcurve .",
    "we first binned the _ maxi _  lightcurve of mrk 421   into @xmath17 , @xmath1 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath13 days .",
    "the fitting procedure for measuring the source flux ( described below ) failed for a significant fraction of the 1-day time bins , especially in fainter phases of the source .",

    "days of short exposure , for which photon statistics were too poor to place meaningful constraint on the source flux , were investigated as follows .",

    "the fit was performed on the central @xmath47 square to avoid confusion from sources outside the region .    from these 768 squares",
    ", we selected the area of which the center is closest to mrk 421 .",
    "for each @xmath1-day time bin , the gsc image of this region was accumulated with a spatial resolution of @xmath48 .",

    "the poisson level corresponding to the power due to the statistical fluctuation is calculated as @xmath70 where @xmath71 denotes the error of the source count rate at @xmath63 .    from the _ maxi _  lightcurve of mrk 421  in figure [ fig : lightcurve ]",

    "we next evaluated the psd shape from the 6 data points with @xmath156 ",
    "@xmath1 , @xmath58 and @xmath44 , where the periodogram appears to be less affected by the gaps ( i.e. , where @xmath157 for @xmath158 ; left panel of figure [ fig : psd_ratio ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : prob_reject ] displays the confidence contours on the @xmath141@xmath98 plane . the best - fit to the _ maxi _  data was achieved at a psd index and normalization @xmath159 and @xmath160 hz@xmath31 , respectively , ( @xmath161 ) , where the errors were evaluated at the 90% confidence level .",
    "the binned logarithmic periodogram simulated for the best - fit psd model are overlaid on the right panel of figure [ fig : psd ] with the open triangles .",
    "it is also plotted in figure [ fig : comp_maxi - asca ] , after the poisson level was subtracted in the similar manner to the observed data .",
    "the variability power at the possible break determined from _ asca _ , @xmath162 hz@xmath31 @xcite , is within the acceptable region of the _ maxi _  data .",
    "fixing the normalization at the _ asca _  value , the psd index in the _ maxi _  range is estimated as @xmath163 .",
    "accounting for the possible uncertainty in @xmath164 discussed in ",
    "[ sec : comp_maxi_asca ] ( a factor of 4 caused by psd fluctuations in the _ asca _  observations and a factor of at most 2 introduced by the different energy coverage ) , the maximum systematic error in @xmath98 is @xmath165 .",
    "therefore , we infer that the psd slope in the _ maxi _  frequency range is flatter than that above the break measured from the _ asca _  data ( @xmath166 ) , but is consistent with the _ asca _  psd slope below the break ( @xmath167 ) , albeit with rather large errors . in the following discussion , we adopt the _ maxi _  result for the low frequency psd index of mrk 421 , since the _ maxi _",
    "data cover a wider frequency range below the break .",
    "these results provide a quantitative support for the psd break between the _ maxi _  and _ asca _  frequency range . surveying the @xmath141@xmath98 plane",
    ", we found that the pl model acceptable to the _ maxi _",
    "data intersects the extrapolation of the _ asca _  result above @xmath168 hz in the @xmath169 hz range .",
    "this implies that the break suggested from the _ maxi _",
    "data is absolutely consistent with the asca result @xcite .",
    "therefore , we concluded that the psd of the x - ray variability of mrk 421   breaks at @xmath170 ",
    "@xmath171 hz . these results clearly demonstrate the utility of _ maxi _",
    "data for evaluating the longterm variability of blazars and , presumably , that of other classes of active galactic nuclei .    investigating the x - ray lightcurves of the three archetypical vhe blazars ( including mrk 421 ) , derived from _ asca _",
    "long - look observations ( exceeding @xmath27 week ) , @xcite identified a break in the sf at timescales of @xmath22 day in all three blazars . in this case , the sf break at @xmath22 day corresponds to a psd break of @xmath172 hz , almost consistent with our result .",
    "however , @xcite , who conducted detailed lightcurve simulations , proposed that the sf break reported in @xcite was artificially induced by the",
    "observation period ( i.e. , @xmath173 week ) .",
    "in contrast to the sf , the periodogram is reported to be relatively robust to artificial breaks introduced by truncated data lengths @xcite . in  [ sec : sim_data_gap ] , we also carefully simulated the artifacts from the data sampling window introduced to the _ maxi _  periodogram .",
    "these analyses confirmed that the psd of mrk 421  breaks at @xmath170  @xmath171 hz ( corresponding to the sf break at @xmath174 a few days ) , where the results were derived by combining the _ maxi _  and _ asca _  data sets .",
    "recently , @xcite investigated the hard x - ray lightcurve of mrk 421  in the @xmath175  @xmath176 kev energy range , extracted from 58-month observations by the _ swift",
    "_ burst alert telescope ( bat ) .",
    "they derived a hard x - ray psd index of @xmath177 in the frequency range @xmath32  @xmath178 hz , significantly smaller than the _ maxi _",
    "result of @xmath179 in @xmath1 ",
    "@xmath2 kev .",
    "this result indicates that the x - ray variability pattern of mrk 421  is energy - dependent especially toward the harder x - ray band , although no energy dependence was suggested in the psd shape below @xmath180 kev @xcite .",
    "otherwise , the psd shape of mrk 421  is possible to be variable in time , because the _ maxi _  observation does not overlap with the 58-month bat one .      by making most of _ maxi _  and _ asca _",
    ", we confirmed that the psd of the x - ray variability pattern from the vhe blazar mrk 421  is significantly flatter in the lower frequencies ( @xmath136 hz ) than in the higher frequencies ( @xmath181 ) .",
    "a steep psd with an index of @xmath182  @xmath1 in the @xmath183 hz range was commonly observed from the vhe blazars @xcite .",
    "this index is significantly higher than those of the the typical seyfert galaxies , @xmath10 ",
    "@xmath11 , when their psds at @xmath32  @xmath184 hz were modeled by a single pl function ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the steep psd of the vhe blazars has been widely ascribed to the physics operated in their jets , such as timescales related to the internal shocks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "interestingly , the _ maxi",
    "_  result on the psd slope of mrk 421   below the break frequency ( @xmath185 ) agrees well with those of the typical seyferts ( @xmath10  @xmath11 ) .",
    "seyfert x - ray emission is believed to originate in the innermost region around the supermassive black hole and its accretion disk .",
    "the jet blobs observed in blazars may ultimately be ejected from the innermost disk , triggered by some disk instabilities .",
    "we thus speculate that the similarity of the psd index over timescales longer than a few days ( corresponding to @xmath186 ) between blazars and seyferts implies a physical connection between the activities in the jet and the innermost accretion disk ( i.e. , the activity of the accretion disk is possible to be propagated to the jets ) .",
    "however , psd indices of @xmath10  @xmath11 are frequently observed in various classes of astrophysical objects , such as neutron star binaries @xcite , magnetars @xcite , and so forth .",
    "obviously , we can not prove the disk - jet connection from the psd shape alone . to confirm this scenario ,",
    "we must construct a realistic model that simultaneously reproduce the psds of both blazars and seyferts over a wide frequency range .",
    "such an undertaking is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "the constructive comments from the anonymous referee have significantly improved the quality of the present paper .",
