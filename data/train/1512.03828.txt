    "two types of convergence structures on the set of upper semi - continuous fuzzy sets attract more and more attention .",
    "one is the convergence induced by endograph metric @xcite which is the hausdorff metric between endographs of fuzzy sets , another is the @xmath0-convergence @xcite derived from the hit - or - miss topology @xcite which is in fact the kuratowski - convergence on endographs of fuzzy sets .",
    "compactness is one of the central concepts in topology and analysis ( see @xcite ) .",
    "many researches are devoted to characterizations of compactness in a variety of fuzzy sets spaces @xcite .",
    "these characterizations are useful in applications @xcite .",
    "kloeden @xcite firstly introduced the endograph metric on upper semi - continuous fuzzy sets .",
    "fan @xcite discussed properties of endograph metric on one - dimensional fuzzy numbers .",
    "yang and zhang @xcite studied topological structure of compact fuzzy numbers on @xmath3 endowed with endograph metric . recently , kloeden and lorenz @xcite have established a peano theorem for fuzzy differential equations based on the use of endograph metric .",
    "so it is needed in both theory and applications to present characterizations of compactness for various kinds of fuzzy sets endowed with endograph metric .",
    "yang and zhou @xcite studied properties of all upper semi - continuous fuzzy sets on compact metric space @xmath9 endowed with the hit - or - miss topology .",
    "nguyen , wang and wei @xcite considered properties of upper semi - continuous fuzzy sets .",
    "the results therein indicate that @xmath0-convergence on @xmath10 is metrizable .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath0-convergence is weaker than the convergence derived from endograph metric on the set of all upper semi - continuous fuzzy sets .",
    "however , we @xcite found an interesting fact that @xmath0-convergence is equivalent to the convergence derived from endograph metric on one - dimensional fuzzy numbers space . since endograph metric is intuitive and",
    "is often used in applications @xcite , it is worthwhile to consider the question on what kinds of subsets of upper semi - continuous fuzzy sets these two types of convergence are equivalence ?    level characterizations of convergence structures on fuzzy sets are interesting and important , the study of which can help us to see the original convergence structures more deeply and clearly .",
    "rojas - medar and romn - flores have pointed out a level characterization of @xmath0-convergence on fuzzy numbers ( proposition 3.5 in @xcite ) . based on this ,",
    "we @xcite have proven that @xmath0-convergence is equivalent to kuratowski - convergence of corresponding @xmath6-cuts a.e . on [ 0,1 ] , and is also equivalent to kuratowski - convergence of all except at most countable of the corresponding @xmath4-cuts . by applying these level characterizations , we discussed relations among level convergence , @xmath11 convergence and @xmath0-convergence . at the same time , fan @xcite also independently obtained above mentioned results .",
    "the discussions in @xcite are carried out in the framework of one - dimensional noncompact fuzzy numbers .",
    "trutschnig @xcite improved these conclusions by extending the conclusions to the cases of @xmath12-dimensional noncompact fuzzy numbers . in applications",
    "@xcite , general fuzzy sets are often used which have no assumptions of convexity , normality , etc .",
    "hence it is natural and important to consider whether these conclusions still hold on general fuzzy sets whose positive @xmath4-cuts have no assumptions of boundedness , and no assumptions of convexity , and even no assumptions of connectedness ?    this is the third theme of this paper .",
    "so it is important to consider the properties of endograph metric and @xmath0-convergence on general fuzzy sets .",
    "in fact , above three questions are closely related . after giving level structural characteristics of fuzzy set itself , we address these three questions in this paper .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sections 2 and 3 ,",
    "we introduce and discuss hausdorff metric and fuzzy sets . in section 4 ,",
    "we investigate level structural characteristics of fuzzy sets .",
    "it shows that @xmath13_{\\alpha}\\nsubseteq   \\overline { \\{u > { \\alpha}\\ } }   \\;\\}$ ] is at most countable when @xmath14 is a fuzzy set on @xmath3 .",
    "based on this conclusion , we investigate hit - or - miss topology continuity and endograph metric continuity of the cut - set functions of fuzzy sets in @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively . in section 5 ,",
    "we consider relationships of endograph metric convergence and @xmath0-convergence on @xmath1 .",
    "it gives a condition under which these two convergence structures are equivalent on @xmath2 .",
    "then we investigate level characterizations of endograph metric convergence and @xmath0-convergence in section 6 .",
    "based on above results , in section 7 , we give characterizations of relatively compact sets , totally bounded sets and compact sets in @xmath7 .",
    "as a consequence , it shows that @xmath7 is a complete space . in section 8 , we give characterizations of relatively compact sets , totally bounded sets and compact sets in @xmath15 , which is a dense subspace of @xmath7 . at",
    "last , in section 9 , we consider properties of various subspaces of @xmath7 .",
    "it points out that endograph metric convergence and @xmath0-convergence are equivalent on @xmath16 , which contains common fuzzy sets such as ( noncompact ) fuzzy numbers , ( noncompact ) fuzzy star - shaped numbers , and ( noncompact ) general fuzzy star - shaped numbers .",
    "then , by using previous results , we present relationships among common subspaces of @xmath7 , and give characterizations of relatively compact sets , totally bounded sets and compact sets in those subspaces .",
