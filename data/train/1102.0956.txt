    "circumstellar disks , formed as a consequence of the star formation process , evolve from an initially gas rich phase to a system composed of small , planetary sized bodies , with little remaining gas .",
    "the physical processes responsible for depleting circumstellar gas from the initial minimum mass solar nebula ( mmsn ) to the low quantities remaining in debris disks , those with significant dust evolution and gas depletion , have been the focus of gas dispersal models @xcite .",
    "models for the evolution of the dust @xcite have been successfully utilized in the interpretation of a variety of infrared ( ir ) spectral shapes @xcite .",
    "these models indicate that while some of the material is locked into planets and still more is accreted onto the star through viscous evolution , it is likely that photoevaporation is the most significant process playing a role in the dispersal of the gas disk .",
    "there are several contributors to photoevaporation , including x - rays or extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) photons from the central star and far ultraviolet ( fuv ) emission produced in an accretion shock at the stellar surface of classical t tauri stars , or ctts @xcite . at",
    "any given time , contributions from several different photoevaporation mechanisms will occur , but the overall timescales when each contribution is greatest may vary .",
    "for example , accretion related radiation fields will decay as the mass accretion rate ( @xmath0 ) decreases .",
    "alternatively , x - ray emission may increase as the accretion related radiation fields drop due to increased magnetic activity in non - accreting t tauri stars ( wtts ) , observed as a possible increase in x - ray luminosity from 1 - 100 myr in the _ chandra _ orion ultradeep project ( coup ) survey of young stars @xcite .",
    "the changing environment may play a role , as fuv and x - rays dominate photoevaporation early at @xmath1 , while euv photons are absorbed in the accretion streams and do not become a significant contributor until @xmath0 drops to @xmath2 @xcite .    with the large number of factors to consider in gas disk evolution ,",
    "the intensity of uv and x - ray radiation fields and the timescales relevant to their evolution are essential parameters in the theory of photoevaporation .",
    "not only observations of the radiation fields , but observations of the frequency of circumstellar disks place constraints on disk evolution theory , with only 10% of sources retaining disks at 10 myr @xcite .",
    "full ( or primordial ) disks and debris disks are observed at both 5 and 10 myr @xcite , indicating that disk dispersal mechanisms must occur on a number of timescales in a single star forming region .",
    "transitional and pre - transitional disks , which due to the presence of a gap are interpreted as an intermediary stage between full and debris disks @xcite , are observed to have a low frequency indicating that when disk dissipation begins it occurs quickly , taking as little as 0.5 myr @xcite .",
    "alternatively , disk evolution may proceed along another path in which a similar decline in ir fluxes from all disk radii indicates that no gap or hole is formed @xcite . with",
    "the diversity observed in disk evolution , different dispersal mechanisms may be necessary . in this paper",
    "we investigate the relevant timescales for the evolution of disk dispersing emission from t tauri stars with new x - ray and fuv observations spanning 1 - 10 myr , and include previous observations of a larger sample of observations extending to young stars at 1 gyr .",
    "while euv emission is almost impossible to observe due to interstellar hydrogen absorption , x - ray observations are numerous .",
    "x - ray emission in t tauri stars is significantly stronger , up to 1000 times , than the x - ray emission from main sequence stars , and comes from hot plasma with temperatures up to 60 mk or energies up to 5 kev @xcite .",
    "the current paradigm is that this hot plasma is produced through enhanced magnetic activity , with stronger magnetic reconnection events the likely cause of observed short period flaring activity @xcite .",
    "there is some evidence that strong soft x - ray emission is produced in an accretion shock on the stellar surface @xcite .",
    "currently observations of a soft x - ray component which dominates over the coronal emission are unique to the star tw hya , although other sources have exhibited accretion produced x - ray emission , though at a significantly lower level @xcite .",
    "surveys of young , @xmath310 myr star forming regions have shown no evidence of a decline in the x - ray emission as @xmath0 decreases , indicating that accretion related x - ray emission is not a significant contributor to the total x - ray flux in most circumstances @xcite . while roughly constant between 1 and 10 myr , eventually the x - ray emission does decrease . when this decline begins has not been well characterized so far because the only 10 myr old x - ray sources studied were the eleven sources in the tw hydra association ( * ? ? ?",

    "ori still has 4 - 5 remaining ctts and a large number of wtts , making it the most populous @xmath510 myr old star forming region known .",
    "extinction in this off - cloud area is low , making it an ideal region for studying x - rays from t tauri stars in older , evolved populations .",
    "less is known about fuv emission from t tauri stars than x - ray emission because , until recent instruments like the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , most fuv detectors lacked the sensitivity to observe dim sources .",
    "large fuv samples have been obtained with the international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) through which fuv line emission has been well characterized @xcite , but little to no signal was achieved in the continuum at @xmath6  for the wtts .",
    "space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) observations of t tauri stars have also been analyzed ; however , long exposure times were required for all but the brightest sources , limiting the ability of stis to observe a large population @xcite . even though iue and stis observations are limited ,",
    "the t tauri properties observed in these high resolution spectra were used to interpret low resolution spectra obtained in a large sample of ctts , wtts , and debris disks using the advanced camera for surveys solar blind channel ( acs / sbc ) prism on hst . while low in resolution , with its excellent sensitivity acs / sbc obtained some of the first observations of wtts in the fuv with the continuum detected from 1230  1800  @xcite .",
    "the origin of fuv emission in t tauri stars has contributions from several sources . in ingleby",
    "et al . ( 2011 ) , we show that in addition to an accretion shock component @xcite , 2 in the inner region of ctts disks contributes to the fuv line and continuum emission @xcite .",

    ", gas is channeled along the magnetic fields lines from the disk to the star , impacting the stellar surface at approximately the free fall velocity .",
    "such fast moving material produces an accretion shock on the surface of the star which heats the gas to @xmath51 mk .",
    "emission from this hot gas heats both the photosphere below the shock and the pre - shock material , producing an accretion column spectrum with a significant excess over the photospheric emission in the uv @xcite .    as inputs to the accretion column model ,",
    "we assume a 0.8@xmath9 source evolving along the @xcite evolutionary tracks , from which we obtain the radius , effective temperature , and luminosity of the source from 110 myr .",
    "we assume the percentage of the stellar surface covered by accretion columns , the filling factor , remains constant at 1% and vary the energy flux in the accretion column for a given @xmath0 @xcite . using these quantities",
    "we calculate the column emission and integrate the flux from 12301800  for the highest and lowest @xmath0 s observed at each age @xcite .",
    "we also calculated the fuv accretion emission for the @xmath0 s predicted from a viscously evolving disk with an initial mass of 0.1@xmath9 @xcite . using this technique , we find we can approximate the range of observed fuv luminosities well ( left panel of figure [ fuvvslaccage ] ) , but for typical ctts masses , the predicted fuv fluxes from the viscously evolving disk are too low ( right panel of figure [ fuvvslaccage ] ) .",
    "the missing fuv emission is probably due to several sources which are not included in our accretion column models .",
    "first , emission from 2 gas was observed in the fuv spectra of ctts and was necessary to explain the fuv continuum between 1500 and 1700  . the contribution of gas emission can be a significant portion ( @xmath5 30% ) of the total fuv emission , although it does not contribute to the disk heating , since it likely originates in the upper layers of the disk @xcite .",
    "in addition , we measure the flux in the strong fuv atomic lines of existing spectra , which our accretion column models do not attempt to reproduce and find that @xmath5 35% of the total fuv flux comes from hot lines .",
    "another contribution necessary for re - producing the short wavelength fuv continuum ( @xmath30  ) could originate in post - shock emission escaping absorption by the pre - shock material .",
    "the post shock spectrum peaks in the soft x - rays but extends into the fuv around 1300  @xcite .",
    "this emission would be important for disk photoevaporation models as soft x - rays can efficiently heat disk gas @xcite , but may only play a role when the @xmath0 drops and the accretion columns become less dense @xcite .",
    "additional observations are required to determine if this is a viable contribution to the fuv spectrum .",
    "after accretion has ended and the gas has been dissipated at @xmath3110 myr , fuv luminosities continue to decline .",
    "this is also observed in magnetically active young stars ; all high energy radiation fields decrease as the sources evolve towards and even along the main sequence @xcite .",
    "given this fact , we looked for any relation between the fuv and x - ray emission in the ctts and non - accretors . in figure [ fuvvsxray ]",
    "we distinguish non - accretors ( diamonds ) from ctts ( squares ) and indicate hotter stars by larger symbols .",
    "we see no correlation between fuv and x - ray emission in the ctts ( with pearson correlation coefficients of 0.3 and -0.2 for total and normalized luminosities , respectively ) but we note that the sources with earlier spectral types tend to have the strongest total fuv and x - ray emission , as they are observed to occupy the upper right hand corner in the left panel of figure [ fuvvsxray ] .",
    "fuv and x - ray luminosities normalized by the stellar luminosity are indistinguishable by spectral type ( right panel of figure [ fuvvsxray ] ) .",
    "we do observe a weak correlation between both total and normalized x - ray and fuv luminosities when considering only the non - accreting sample , with pearson correlation coefficients of 0.74 and 0.80 , respectively .",
    "we compare results from our sample of non - accreting young stars ( excluding the low mass twa sources ) to an analysis of solar analogs between 0.1 and 10 gyr @xcite , which showed that high energy fields between 1 and 1200  decreased with age , with emission from hotter plasmas diminishing more quickly . for our sample of non - accreting solar type sources between 15 myr and 1 gyr , classified as young suns in the formation and evolution of planetary systems survey ( feps ; meyer et al .",
    "2006 ) , we compare the observed luminosities to those predicted assuming the power law relations between flux in a given energy range and age from @xcite . the predicted decay of x - ray luminosities is similar to that which we observe for the youngest of the solar type non - accretors in our sample but fail to re - produce the 1 gyr source , hd 53143 ( see figure [ ribas ] ) .",
    "we also compare the slope of the predicted fuv fluxes between 9201180  to the slope of our observations which cover 12301800  .",
    "the total predicted luminosities were scaled , due to the use of different wavelength bins , but the slope was held constant .",
    "again , the younger sources follow the predicted slope but the 1 gyr source has an unexpectedly high fuv luminosity .",
    "it is unclear why hd 53143 is discrepant in both x - rays and fuv fluxes for its age , with several different age indicators providing consistent values @xcite .",
    "our young solar analogs extend the radiation evolution observed in @xcite to younger ages , and agree with their result that the higher energy radiation fields decline more quickly than the cooler fields . combining our results with those of @xcite , we see evidence that even past the 10 myr time period for disk dispersal and planet formation , high energy fields strongly in excess of the solar values persist and may have an effect on evolving disks and planets .      using observations for a limited number of t tauri stars , @xcite have investigated the origin of the he ii @xmath321640 and c iv @xmath321549 lines and their relationship to the continuum flux , responsible for photoevaporation of the gas disk . in particular , @xcite propose that the ratio of the he ii to c iv is a probe of the euv radiation field .",
    "they base their conclusion on the fact that single temperature and density models of collisionally ionized plasmas can not reproduce the observed strengths of the he ii line , from which they infer that the line must be produced by radiative recombination .",
    "since the ionization threshold for he i is 228  , they conclude that the line is a probe of the strength of the radiation field around this wavelength , namely , the euv .    here ,",
    "we revisit these lines using our larger sample of fuv spectra of t tauri stars .",
    "we measure the he ii and c iv fluxes in our acs / sbc and stis samples of sources with the stis observations degraded to the low resolution of acs / sbc . as a result of the resolution",
    ", we are measuring a blend of emission lines in each line feature , including both components of the c iv doublet and numerous 2 lines present in the vicinity of c iv and he ii . while adding to the scatter in our measurements , the dominant line in each region is the he ii or the c iv line , with 2 line contributions @xmath33 . as discussed in @xmath7[fuvlum ] , the largest source of uncertainty comes from the reddening correction of the fuv spectra , so to estimate errors on the he ii and c iv line luminosities we assume a range of @xmath280.2 magnitudes in @xmath11 .",
    "figure [ linevsage ] shows he ii and c iv line luminosities and their dependence on age and @xmath29 .",
    "both he ii and c iv line luminosities are observed to decrease with age with the lowest values obtained for non - accretors .",
    "we find strong correlations between line luminosities and @xmath29 , with pearson coefficients @xmath5 0.84 and 0.88 for he ii and c iv , respectively .",
    "the strength of both lines is clearly related to accretion , as was previously found by @xcite and @xcite .    in the left panel of figure [ ratiovsagelacc ]",
    "we show the he ii to c iv ratio for the ctts and non - accretors of our sample as a function of age . the value of the ratio is higher in non - accretors than in the ctts , confirming the trend found by @xcite .",
    "these authors suggest that this trend indicates that the ionizing flux is not powered by accretion , since the ratio would be expected to decrease if that were the case .",
    "we suggest , instead , that the difference between the he ii to c iv ratio between the ctts and the non - accretors arises from the different formation mechanisms of the lines in each type of star .",
    "the he ii @xmath321640 and c iv @xmath321549 lines in non - accretors must form in the transition region , as they do in the sun and in magnetically active stars , indicated by the similarity of the ratio in the two classes of stars @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the correlations between line luminosity and @xmath29 found in ctts indicate that these lines must form in the accretion flows or at least in regions powered by accretion energy .",
    "however , despite the line luminosity dependence on @xmath29 , we find no correlation between the he ii to c iv ratio and @xmath29 , as shown in the right panel of figure [ ratiovsagelacc ] .",
    "studies of the optical and infrared lines of he i and he ii in ctts indicate that the lines have multiple components arising in the accretion shocks , the magnetospheric infall regions , and the winds @xcite .",
    "no comparable analysis of the c iv line has been done , but it is also likely that this line has contributions from the accretion shock and from the infall region , given its large velocity width @xcite .",
    "this diversity may be responsible for the large dispersion of the he ii to c iv ratios in ctts .",
    "we therefore caution against using the he ii to c iv ratio as an indicator of euv emission without a careful treatment of accretion related emission in these lines .",
    "regardless of the effectiveness of the he ii to c iv line ratio in tracing the euv emission , strong euv emission is likely present in the high energy spectrum of t tauri stars .",
    "@xcite showed that euv emission decreases with age , or increases with the spin of the source .",
    "they also showed that younger sources have enhanced euv line emission , in particular strong he ii and fe lines around 300 - 350  .",
    "whether the euv emission continues to increase at @xmath310 myr like the fuv emission or flattens and remains constant like the x - ray emission is not clear , but in either case the euv emission is expected to be strong . in our model of the accretion column which contributes emission to the fuv spectrum (  [ xray_uv ] ) , we find that the euv luminosity produced in the shock is @xmath34 . in the current model ,",
    "only @xmath52% of this emission escapes the high density material which is still accreting ; however , recent work has shown that varying accretion properties , like the accretion rate or infall velocity , affects the amount of shock emission which can be observed @xcite .",
    "future models of the emission from the accretion column which take this into account will provide better estimates of the euv emission which is available for photoevaporation .",
    "in contrast to early photoevaporation models in which the primary mechanism for dispersing the disk utilized euv radiation from the star producing winds with mass loss rates of @xmath35 @xcite , recent models stress that either fuv or x - ray radiation fields are significantly more important in dispersing the disk with mass loss rates 100 times higher than in the pure euv case . while in agreement on the values of the mass loss rate , @xcite achieve these high rates with x - ray radiation while @xcite find the fuv radiation drives the photoevaporation . with the large range of ages in our x - ray and fuv samples , we explore the photoevaporation theories in the context of our observations .",
    "our results agree with previous findings by @xcite and @xcite showing that the x - ray luminosity remains roughly constant during the first 10 myr .",
    "regarding models of x - ray photoevaporation , @xcite use @xmath36 for @xmath37 kev as their x - ray luminosity .",
    "we find similar , though consistently lower , x - ray luminosities for the typical ctts mass sources in our sample .",
    "@xcite note that their input x - ray luminosity is large and that further analyses will include lower x - ray luminosities .",
    "an important new result in this work is the evolution of the fuv radiation , where we see that the luminosity between 1230 and 1800  clearly drops between 1 and 10 myr .",
    "@xcite incorporate the evolution of fuv luminosity in their models for disk dispersal , assuming that @xmath0 evolves viscously and the fuv luminosity is 0.4 @xmath29 . in figure [ fuvvslaccage ]",
    "we showed the evolution of the fuv luminosity along with the predicted fuv emission produced in an accretion column from a viscously evolving disk onto a 0.8@xmath9 star .",
    "we found that the predicted fuv accretion emission is lower than the observed fuv fluxes , although , within an order of magnitude ( assuming typical mass ctts have @xmath38 ) and we discussed origins for the remaining fuv emission in @xmath7[xray_uv ] .",
    "the fuv fluxes used by @xcite are similar to those we observe , but we found that @xmath51/3 of this emission may be produced by 2 in the circumstellar disk ( ingleby et al .",
    "2011 ) and therefore not directly irradiating the gas in the disk .",
    "our observations support the requirements of both the x - ray and the fuv dominated photoevaporation models of @xcite and @xcite ; however , several issues remain unresolved .",
    "for example , circumstellar disks of gas and dust have been observed around much older sources , including the 10 myr ctts tw hya which maintains a 0.06 @xmath9 disk , albeit a transitional disk @xcite .",
    "full disks of gas and dust are also observed around the 710 myr ctts in 25 ori @xcite . according to @xcite , the continued existence of full disks at late stages",
    "could be explained by the range of x - ray luminosities observed , with lower x - ray luminosities increasing the disk lifetime and , alternatively , the presence of young wtts may be due to high x - ray luminosities in those sources . in our 25 ori observations",
    "in which @xmath590% are wtts , we find that the median x - ray luminosity ( log @xmath39 ) is 29.7 erg @xmath40 and the four accreting sources have only marginally lower or , in one case , even higher x - ray luminosities . with similar x - ray luminosities to the wtts , these accreting sources should have cleared their inner gas disks in similar timescales .",
    "if we look at the x - ray luminosities of the wtts in the 2.5 myr chamaeleon region , we find a median log @xmath41 @xmath40 , lower than all of the 25 ori accretors , indicating that if these x - ray luminosities may disperse an inner gas disk in @xmath52.5 myr , they would clearly be gone by 10 myr .",
    "an additional parameter , besides a range of x - ray luminosities , is necessary to explain the diversity of disks observed at a given age .",
    "when including the time evolution of the fuv radiation fields and their dependence on disk properties , like @xmath0 , @xcite find fuv fields evolving on a range of timescales related to differences in the accretion properties .",
    "therefore , photoevaporation dominated by evolving fuv fields may disperse disks in a range of timescales .",
    "with fuv driven photoevaporation and evolving fuv fields , the diversity of disks observed at any age may be expected .",
    "this appears to be a plausible scenario given the large range of observed fuv luminosities and inferred @xmath0 s .",
    "again , the full disks in the 25 ori association present an obstacle to the theory .",
    "the observed fuv luminosities of the 25 ori accretors are @xmath5 2 orders of magnitude higher than the wtts in the 10 myr twa association , and given our results and those of @xcite , were likely stronger at 1 myr .",
    "these fuv luminosities should be high enough to photoevaporate the gas disk , if fuv emission was responsible for the gas depletion in the twa wtts .",
    "possible explanations for the remaining full disks in 25 ori , in the context of both x - ray and fuv photoevaporation theories , include low disk viscosities or high initial disk masses which increase the time for disk dispersal @xcite .",
    "so far , we have focused on the gas in circumstellar disks ; however , it is unclear if gas and dust evolution proceed concurrently or independently @xcite .",
    "@xcite modeled the affect of photoevaporation on the gas and dust in the circumstellar disk and found that the removal of gas from the disk has significant effects on the dust .",
    "when photoevaporation creates a gap in the gas disk , the inner disk dust is also removed . also , pressure gradients formed when gas is removed cause the dust to migrate and may enhance grain growth .",
    "for these reasons , we may expect to see dust evolution dependent on the strength of the photoevaporative fields . with constant x - ray fields throughout disk evolution , we focus on the accretion related fuv radiation fields",
    ".    @xcite find that dust dissipation and accretion are characterized by different timescales and to test this further , we compare fuv luminosities to 2mass @xmath42 @xcite , irac ( _ spitzer _ infrared array camera ) , and mips ( _ spitzer _ multiband imaging photometer ) colors .",
    "irac and mips photometry , along with disk classifications for our source sample , were taken from the literature : taurus @xcite , chamaeleon i @xcite , chamaeleon ii @xcite , 25 ori @xcite , twa @xcite , and debris disks @xcite .",
    "figure [ disk ] shows the relations between fuv luminosity and inner disk dust tracers . at @xmath43 m",
    "we are tracing the dust in the inner regions of the disk ; as shown in @xcite , 60% of the 24 @xmath44 m emission is coming from inside 10 au when the dust has not settled towards the midplane .",
    "the percentage of emission coming from within 10 au increases when observing at the shorter irac wavelengths , or when observing a disk in which some degree of dust settling has occurred .    among the ctts ( circles ) in figure",
    "[ disk ] , we find tentative correlations between fuv luminosity and each of the disk evolution tracers , with the most convincing correlation in @xmath45 .",
    "however , we are likely observing two quantities which correlate with @xmath29 .",
    "we showed in figure [ fuvvslaccage ] that the sources with highest fuv luminosities are also the strongest accretors .",
    "disk properties also depend on the accretion rate through the disk and the ir spectral energy distributions reflect this ; models predict that lower @xmath0 s will produce bluer ir colors and that the ir spectrum becomes increasingly flatter as @xmath0 increases @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is likely that these apparent trends are a result of accretion affecting both the fuv luminosities and the tracers of dust in the disk instead of a consequence of direct processing of the dust by fuv radiation .",
    "this seems to indicate that if it is the fuv that is responsible for gas dispersal , the gas and dust are evolving independently . supporting this conclusion , the transitional @xcite and pre - transitional @xcite disks , the sources likely to have undergone dust processing and evolution , have the same fuv luminosities as the full disks , indicating that the fuv is not likely having a strong effect on the dust .",
    "we present new observations of t tauri stars in the chamaeleon i and ii and the 25 ori star forming regions .",
    "included are _ chandra _ x - ray and acs / sbc fuv observations which provide constraints on the photoevaporative fluxes present in young stars .",
    "combined with previously published x - ray and fuv observations , we explored the evolution of high energy radiation fields with the following results :    * with the addition of @xmath540 sources with x - ray observations in the 710 myr 25 ori star forming association , a significant addition to the @xmath525 previously observed 610 myr t tauri stars ( above the substellar limit ) , we confirm results that there is no decay in the x - ray luminosity between 1 and 10 myr . with consistently strong x - ray radiation fields , disk photoevaporation ,",
    "if driven by x - rays , should proceed on short timescales .",
    "however , observations of sources with remaining disk gas emission and strong x - ray luminosities at 710 myr and previous observations of tw hya ( a source with a transitional disk and strong x - ray luminosity ) still can not be explained by x - ray photoevaporation .",
    "* we show , for the first time , the observed evolution of the fuv radiation fields in pre - main sequence stars from 1 myr to 1 gyr .",
    "we find that the fuv luminosity decline can be explained , in part , by the decline of the accretion rate onto the star but note that some fuv emission must come from an additional source which is likely gas in the inner disk regions .",
    "if fuv drives photoevaporation of the gas disk , the diversity of disks observed at 1 myr can be understood by the large range of @xmath0 s observed at 1 myr .",
    "however , gas disks at 710 myr require additional explanation , as viscous @xmath0 evolution predicts that these sources should have had strong fuv radiation in the past , so disk dispersal by fuv radiation should have proceeded quickly . *",
    "we show that the power law relations for the decay of high energy radiation fields in solar type active stars described by @xcite extend to the significantly younger sample discussed here . with both the x - ray luminosities and the slope of the fuv relation accurately predicted",
    ", we expect that the difficult to observe euv radiation fields will similarly obey the power law trends .",
    "this result tells us that strong radiation fields , necessary to remove the gas , are present throughout the disk dispersal phase .",
    "* we find no correlation between fuv luminosities and tracers of dust evolution in the disk and furthermore , we find that sources with significant dust processing , the transitional disks , have similar fuv luminosities to full disk sources . therefore ,",
    "if fuv radiation is the key emission field in gas evolution , it is not driving the dust depletion .",
    "this would indicate that gas and dust evolution occur independently , though interestingly on similar timescales .",
