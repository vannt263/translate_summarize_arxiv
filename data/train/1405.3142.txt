    "the associate production of hadrons by photons has been extensively studied since it provides an excellent tool to learn details of the hadron spectrum . in particular , the @xmath0 reaction is an efficient isospin @xmath9 filter for studying nucleon resonances decaying to @xmath10 . as a consequence ,",
    "the experimental database on this reaction has expanded significantly in recent years .",
    "in addition to the pioneering measurements at cornell  @xcite , cea  @xcite , slac  @xcite and daresbury  @xcite laboratories , in 2001 the clas collaboration investigated this process in electroproduction  @xcite and later in 2010 , this reaction has been examined at photon energies below 2.4 gev in the spring-8 leps experiment using a forward - angle spectrometer and polarized photons  @xcite , and from threshold to 2.65 gev with the saphir detector at the electron stretcher facility elsa in bonn  @xcite .",
    "very recently , the exclusive @xmath8 photoproduction cross section has been measured by using the clas detector for energies from threshold up to an invariant @xmath11 mass @xmath12 gev  @xcite .    in parallel to this great experimental activity , there have also been a large number of theoretical investigations of the @xmath8 ( @xmath13 ) resonance production with the @xmath0 reaction . for invariant masses",
    "@xmath14 gev , most of these theoretical calculations  @xcite describe reasonably well the experimental data within the framework of effective lagrangian approach .",
    "one of the latest of these works correspond to that of ref .",
    "@xcite , where in addition to the contact , @xmath6-channel nucleon pole and @xmath2-channel @xmath3 exchange contributions , which were already considered in previous works , the @xmath6-channel @xmath7 [ previously called @xmath15 resonance and the @xmath4-channel @xmath5 hyperon pole terms were also included .",
    "the latter mechanism had been ignored in all previous calculations  @xcite that relied on the very forward @xmath1 angular leps data  @xcite , where its contribution was expected to be small .",
    "however , it produced an enhancement for large @xmath1 angles , and it become more and more relevant as the photon energy increases , being essential to describe the clas differential cross sections at backward angles . on the other hand , the combined analysis of the clas and leps data carried out in ref .",

    "however , for invariant masses @xmath17 2.35 gev and forward angles , some small discrepancies ( though systematic ) between the clas data and the theoretical predictions appear ( see lower panels of fig .  3 of ref .",
    "@xcite , collected here in the right panels of fig .",

    "this should not be entirely surprising , since the model of ref .",
    "@xcite is not suited at high energies and forward angles , where quark - gluon string mechanisms could become important  @xcite . actually , it is obvious from the analysis of the experimental hadron cross section data that the reggeon and the pomeron exchange mechanisms play a crucial role at high energies and small transferred momenta  @xcite .",
    "the underlying philosophy of the regge formalism is as follows . in modeling the reaction amplitude for the @xmath19 process at high energies and small @xmath20 or @xmath21 , instead of considering the exchange of a finite selection of individual particles ,",
    "the exchange of entire regge trajectories is taken into account .",
    "this exchange can take place in the @xmath2 channel ( kaonic trajectories ) or @xmath4 channel ( hyperonic trajectories ) .",
    "as such , regge theory offers an elegant way to circumvent the controversial issue of modeling high - spin , high - mass particle exchange .",
    "different dominant mechanisms have been proposed to describe the lamp2 ( daresbury laboratory  @xcite ) high energy differential cross sections .",
    "thus , in refs .  @xcite it was claimed a large contribution from a @xmath2-channel @xmath22 regge exchange . however , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was argued that the @xmath22 contribution should be quite small , almost negligible , since the @xmath23 coupling is expected to be much smaller than the value implicitly assumed in the previous works resonance is located very close to the threshold energy of the @xmath24 channel , which dominates the @xmath8 dynamics .",
    "indeed , it could be considered as bound state of these two hadrons , with some corrections from coupled channel dynamics .",
    "for very small binding energies , all the couplings of the resonance tend to zero as the mass of the bound state approaches the @xmath24 threshold  @xcite . ] .",
    "nevertheless , a reggeon exchange model , but with a @xmath3- ( instead of a @xmath22 ) trajectory was also used in ref .",
    "it was also discussed there that the @xmath3 reggeon mechanism is more favored by the lamp2 data than the @xmath22 reggeon one , and that it is able to reproduce the available experimental data in the region from @xmath25 gev up to 5 gev .",
    "reggeized propagators for the @xmath3 and @xmath22 exchanges in the @xmath2-channel implemented in a gauge - invariant manner were employed in ref .",

    ", we improve on the model of ref .",
    "@xcite by including the contribution of a @xmath26regge trajectory exchange at high energies and low momentum transfers .",

    "recently , it has appeared a work  @xcite with similar objectives and ideas .",
    "there , the crucial role played by the @xmath4-channel @xmath5 hyperon pole term at backward angles is confirmed , as well as the importance of the @xmath7 resonance to describe the leps data . moreover ,",
    "regge effects are also discussed and taken into account , within a hybrid model that has indeed many formal resemblances - channel regge effects would have also been considered for large scattering angles . ] with the one that will be presented in this work . however , in sharp contrast with the model derived here , @xmath22 regge trajectory effects are considered in ref .",
    "@xcite and claimed to provide a considerable contribution at high energies .",

    "a great opportunity to take advantage of the accurate leps and clas data , not only for claiming the existence of the two - star @xmath7 state , but also for constraining / determining some of its poorly known properties is somehow missed in the analysis carried out in ref .",

    "[ fig : tcs ] , where the lamp2 cross sections have been scaled down by a factor 0.6 .",
    "this agreement might give some support to the idea of finding regge signatures in the clas data .",
    "results from model b are also shown , which turn out to provide a good description of both sets of data . we should , however , prevent the reader about the _",
    "ad hoc _ modification of the normalization of the old lamp2 cross sections  .",

    "results from model b are also shown : the blue - dashed and black - dash - dotted curves stand for the contributions from the effective lagrangian approach background and reggeon exchange mechanism , respectively ( see text for details ) .",
    "the green - dotted lines show the contribution of the @xmath7 resonance term , while the red - solid lines display the results obtained from the full model .",
    "the shaded region accounts for the 68% cl band inherited from the gaussian correlated statistical errors of the parameters . ]",
    "we have presented some evidences of regge signatures in the clas data at forward angles , despite the energies involved in that experiment are only moderately high .",
    "this is not entirely surprising , because above @xmath139 gev , and up to an overall normalization , the clas @xmath8 total cross section dependence on the photon energy matches that inferred from the lamp2 data , which extends up to 5 gev , in a region where the regge behavior is expected to be visible ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : tcs ] ) .",
    "indeed , we find a significant improvement on the description of the clas high energy forward cross sections , when the effective lagrangian approach of ref .",
    "@xcite is supplemented with some string quark ",
    "gluon mechanism contributions determined by a kaon trajectory .",
    "now , there are no visible systematic discrepancies between the hybrid approach predictions and the data .",
    "thus , we confirm the findings of the recent work of ref .",
    "@xcite on the importance of the regge effects in achieving an accurate description of the clas forward angular distributions .",
    "we do not need to include any contribution from a @xmath22 trajectory , in accordance to the analysis of the lamp2 data carried out in refs .",
    "this is re - assuring since the @xmath117channel @xmath22 contribution should be quite small , almost negligible , in sharp contrast with previous works  @xcite , where a large @xmath140 coupling was assumed .",
    "such big values for this coupling are ruled out by unitarized chiral models  @xcite , that predict values for @xmath140 around a factor 10 ( 20 ) smaller than for instance those used in refs .",
    "@xcite , and by measurements of the photon - beam asymmetry , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we have designed a gauge invariant hybrid model which smoothly interpolates from the hadron effective lagrangian approach  @xcite , at energies close to threshold , to a model that incorporates quark - gluon string reaction mechanism contributions at high energies and forward @xmath1 scattering angles .",
    "we find an accurate description of both clas and leps data .",
    "the latter set of low energy cross sections is not affected by the inclusion of regge effects .",
    "the bump structure observed at forward @xmath1 angles in these data is well described thanks to the significant contribution from the two - star @xmath16 @xmath7 resonance in the @xmath6-channel , which existence gets a strong support from this improved analysis that is now fully consistent with the accurate clas data .",
    "thus , this associated strangeness production reaction becomes an excellent tool to determine the properties of this resonance ( helicity amplitudes determined by the couplings @xmath100 and @xmath101 or the strength of the @xmath141 vertex ) . in what respects to the clas data , regge effects play a crucial role at forward angles for energies above 2.35 gev , as commented before , while the backward angle data highlight the importance of the @xmath4-channel @xmath5 hyperon pole term .",
    "this latter fact can be used to constrain the radiative @xmath142 decay , as it was firstly emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the @xmath2-range explored by the clas data is not large enough to fully restrict the regge form - factor , which is the major difference among the two models ( a and b ) introduced in this work .",
    "though , in the region of negative @xmath2 , the reggeized propagator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nam ] ) exhibits a factorial growth , which is in principle not acceptable , the limited range of momentum transfers accessible in the data does not see this unwanted behaviour .",
    "this is the same reason why the gaussian cutoff parameter @xmath143 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : agauss ] ) is not further constrained .",
    "unfortunately , the existing large discrepancies among clas and lamp2 data sets prevents the inclusion of this latter experiment in the analysis carried out in this work .",
