    "hadronic distribution amplitudes(das ) are important ingredients in applying qcd to hard exclusive processes via the factorization theorem  @xcite .",
    "they provide essential information on the nonperturbative structure of hadron describing the distribution of partons in terms of the longitudinal momentum fractions inside the hadron .",
    "both the electromagnetic form factors at high @xmath13 and the @xmath14-physics phenomenology are highly relevant to the detailed computation of hadronic das .    during the past few decades",
    ", there have been many theoretical efforts to calculate the pion da using nonperturbative methods such as the qcd sum rule  @xcite , lattice calculation  @xcite , chiral quark model from the instanton vacuum  @xcite , nambu - jona - lasinio(njl ) model  @xcite , and light - front quark model(lfqm )  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the shape of the pion quark da is very important in the predictions of pion electromagnetic form factor in both nonperturbative and perturbative momentum transfer regimes .",
    "the qcd sum - rule based analysis  @xcite of the @xmath15 transition form factor @xmath16 measured by the cleo experiment  @xcite has shown that neither double - humped da for the pion predicted by chernyak and zhitnitsky  @xcite nor the asymptotic one are favored at the 2@xmath17 level of accuracy .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the recent anti - de sitter space geometry / conformal field theory(ads / cft ) prediction  @xcite for the meson da is @xmath18 , which would approach to the asymptotic form @xmath19 only in the limit of @xmath20 .",
    "the shape of @xmath21 increases the usual perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) predictions for the pion form factor and @xmath15 transition form factor by 16/9 and 4/3 , respectively . in our recent lfqm application to the pqcd analysis of the pion form factor  @xcite",
    ", we further found a correlation between the shape of quark da and the amount of soft and hard contributions to the pion form factor .",
    "similar to the previous findings from the sudakov suppression of the soft contribution ( or enhancement of the hard contribution )  @xcite , our results indicated that the suppression of the endpoint region for the quark da corresponds to the suppression(enhancement ) of the soft(hard ) contribution .",
    "another important area that requires detailed study of meson das is the b - physics phenomenology under intense experimental investigation at babar and belle experiments .",
    "the @xmath22 and @xmath1 das have attracted attention rather recently  @xcite due to the deep relevance to the exclusive @xmath14-meson decays to @xmath23 mesons . in particular , the @xmath24 flavor symmetry breaking effect in the meson quark da including strange quark is important for the predictions of exclusive @xmath25-decays to light pseudoscalar and vector mesons in the context of cp - violation and cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa quark mixing matrix studies .",
    "the @xmath24 breaking effect is realized in the difference between the longitunal momenta of the strange and nonstrange quark , @xmath26 , in the two particle fock components of the meson .",
    "the similar effect was also found in our pqcd analysis  @xcite for the exclusive heavy meson pair production in @xmath27 annihilations at @xmath28 gev .",
    "not only the shape of the heavy meson quark das matters in the prediction of the cross section for the heavy meson pair productions , but also the cross section ratios for @xmath29 and @xmath30 deviate from 1 appreciably due to the @xmath24 symmetry breaking .",
    "a particularly convenient and intuitive framework in applying pqcd to exclusive processes is based upon the light - front(lf ) fock - state decomposition of hadronic state . in the lf framework ,",
    "the valence quark da is computed from the valence lf wave function @xmath31 of the hadron at equal lf time @xmath32 which is the probability amplitude to find @xmath33 constituents(quarks , antiquarks , and gluons ) with lf momenta @xmath34 in a hadron . here ,",
    "@xmath35 and @xmath36 are the lf momentum fraction and the transverse momenta of the @xmath37th constituent in the @xmath33-particle fock - state , respectively .",
    "if the factorization theorem in pqcd is applicable to exclusive processes , then the invariant amplitude @xmath38 for exclusive process factorizes into the convolution of the process - independent valence quark da @xmath39 with the process - dependent hard scattering amplitude @xmath40  @xcite , i.e. [ fac ] m=(x_i,)t_h(x_i , y_i,)(y_i , ) , where @xmath41=\\delta(1-\\sigma^n_{k=1}x_k)\\pi^n_{k=1}dx_k$ ] and @xmath33 is the number of quarks in the valence fock state . here",
    ", @xmath42 denotes the separation scale between perturbative and nonperturbative regime .",
    "since the collinear divergences are summed in @xmath43 , the hard scattering amplitude @xmath40 can be systematically computed as a perturbative expansion in @xmath44 . to implement the factorization theorem given by eq .",
    "( [ fac ] ) at high momentum transfer , the hadronic wave function plays an important role linking between long distance nonperturbative qcd encoded in da and short distance pqcd encoded in @xmath40 .",
    "the quark da of a meson , @xmath39 , is the probability of finding collinear quarks up to the scale @xmath42 in the @xmath45(@xmath46-wave ) projection of the meson wave function defined by [ da1 ] ( x_i,)=^|*k*_|<[d^2*k*_i ] ( x_i,*k*_i ) , where [ kp ] [ d^2*k*_i]= 2(2)^3^n_i=1 .",
    "simple relativistic quark - model based on the lf framework has been studied for various mesons@xcite .",
    "although the proof of duality between the lfqm and the first principle qcd is not yet available , we have attempted to fill the gap between the model wave function and the qcd - motivated effective hamiltonian@xcite .",
    "the essential feature of our lfqm  @xcite is to treat the gaussian radial wave function as a trial function for the variational principle to the qcd - motivated hamiltonian .",
    "we saturate the fock state expansion by the constituent quark and antiquark , i.e. @xmath47 , where the interaction potential @xmath48 consists of confining and hyperfine interaction terms . from the variational principle minimizing the central hamiltonian with respect to the gaussian parameter",
    ", we can find the optimum values of our model parameters and predict the mass spectra for the low - lying ground state pseudoscalar and vector mesons  @xcite .",
    "we applied our lfqm for various exclusive processes such as the electromagnetic form factors of @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath3  @xcite mesons and semileptonic and rare @xmath14 decays to @xmath2 and @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "our results for the above exclusive processes were in a good agreement with the available data as well as other theoretical model predictions .",
    "the purpose of this work is to calculate the quark das , the gegenbauer moments , and decay constants for @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons using our lfqm and compare with other theoretical model predictions . as expected , while the odd gegenbauer moments for @xmath2 and @xmath3 meson das are found to be zero due to isospin symmetry , the odd moments for @xmath4 and @xmath1 meson das are nonzero due to the flavor su(3)-symmetry breaking effect .",
    "we compute the decay constants for the transversely polarized @xmath3 and @xmath1 mesons(@xmath5 and @xmath6 ) as well as the longitudinally polarized ones(@xmath7 and @xmath8 ) and compare with the light - cone sum rule(lcsr ) calculations , in which the ratio of @xmath49 and @xmath50 is an important ingredient for the lcsr predictions of the @xmath51 and @xmath52 transition form factors .",
    "we also confirm that our results for the decay constants follow an old su(6 ) symmetry relation  @xcite , @xmath12 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec.ii , we briefly describe the formulation of our lfqm  @xcite and the procedure of fixing the model parameters using the variational principle for the qcd - motivated effective hamiltonian .",
    "the shape of the quark da is then uniquely determined in our model calculation . in sec.iii , the formulae for the quark das and decay constants of pseudoscalar and vector mesons",
    "are given in our lfqm .",
