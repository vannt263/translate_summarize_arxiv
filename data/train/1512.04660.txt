    "although the studied tls should be far detuned in the relevant power range , there may be other weakly coupled tls which do not stark tune as easily , but still absorb and scatter photons at a high rate . at high drive powers on the other hand , all tls are either saturated due to the high intra - cavity photon numbers , or far detuned from the drive and resonator frequencies .    on resonance , the vacuum rabi split linewidths",
    "are approximately given by an equal mixture of resonator and tls linewidth , which we use to estimate @xmath324  mhz .",
    "we extract a tls coupling of @xmath325  mhz from the minimum separation of the measured spectroscopic lines ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tls ]  c ) .",
    "this puts our system very close to the strong coupling limit @xmath326 .",
    "we can also put a lower bound on the electric dipole moment of this tls @xmath327  debye depending on the tls orientation and the exact position on the capacitor .",
    "this value is comparable to many atomic , nano- and microscopic systems , where strong coupling is not readily observed .",
    "the presented techniques therefore open up new possibilities to realize hybrid systems and can help study the loss mechanism that plague superconducting quantum processors more directly , selectively and with higher sensitivity ."
