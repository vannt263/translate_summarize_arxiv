    "we believe that the present proposal and that for the implementation of two - qubit polariton - induced operations@xcite suggest that a complete quantum - computing scalable architecture based on a solid - state system is possible using polaritons in 2d - microcavities .    .",
    "real systems can not be entirely isolated from their environment .",
    "this is specially true for solid - state systems where several particles co - exist .",
    "when control is in mind , undesired interactions make the evolution unpredictable with the possibility of partial or total failure of the control operation . in our case ,",
    "excitons , photons , and spins suffer from the coupling with the environment . for highly pure samples , low temperatures and low exciton density ,",
    "the relevant decoherence processes for excitons are those causing spin flip of electrons and holes , with conversion between bright and dark excitons @xcite . in general",
    "hole spins loss coherence faster than electron spins ; for instance , in cdte the spin relaxation of electrons is 29ps@xcite , while that for holes is @xmath2ps@xcite .",
    "in addition , the annihilation of excitons must be also considered , with associated lifetime of hundred ps in gainnas / gaas @xcite .",
    "while different processes , such as structural disorder@xcite are responsible for the loss of photon population and coherence , the main process is photon leakage off the cavity due to its finite q - factor , which leads to a lifetime of the order of @xmath3ps @xcite . at extremely low concentration of impurities with densities @xmath4 @xmath5 ,",
    "electrons bound to different donors are well localized and do not interact among them @xcite .",
    "the interaction with the nuclei is dominant ( due to the strong confinement of the localized state ) . at temperatures @xmath6",
    "the transverse relaxation time t2@xmath7 is a few ns for the electron bound to a donor , and the spin relaxation time is of the order of @xmath1s for donors in gaas  @xcite .",
    "in what follows , we work in the heisenberg picture ; thus , time - dependent operators shall be everywhere understood .",
    "the free hamiltonian reads @xmath8 where the first and second terms correspond to excitons ( @xmath9 ) and cavity photons ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the qw quantum confinement splits the heavy- and light - hole electronic bands , forming excitons out of conduction - band electrons with total angular momentum @xmath11 and valence - band heavy holes with @xmath12 .",
    "bright ( @xmath13 ) and dark ( @xmath14 ) excitons are included : @xmath15 , where the single ( double ) arrow identifies an electron ( hole ) angular momentum .",
    "the respective dispersion relations for excitons and photons are @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the in - plane momentum ; the momentum @xmath19 in the growth direction is determined by parameters of the cavity , @xmath20 is the index of refraction , and @xmath21 the speed of light .",

    "here we adopted a more detailed notation for the spin @xmath37 of the exciton : the electron ( hole ) spin has index @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) , and @xmath40 is the vector of pauli matrices.@xcite x - x interaction is disregarded , because we will study the case of low exciton concentration , where @xmath41 , with @xmath42 the exciton bohr radius .",
    "different theoretical tools are employed to solve problems in exciton - polariton research .",
    "heisenberg equations of motion describe the dynamics of mean values of either exciton / photon operators or polariton operators @xcite .",
    "it is also common the use of the gross - pitaevskii equation@xcite .",
    "other methods have also been used , such as the hartree - fock - popov@xcite .",
    "we make use of the heisenberg equations of motion ( hem ) @xmath43\\rangle $ ] for mean values ( @xmath44 ) of operators describing separately excitons , photons , and the impurity spin .",
    "this allows us to treat the cases of weak where no polaritons exist and strong coupling , as well as to include easily spin - flip processes that cause a polariton to dissociate into a dark exciton and a photon .",
    "in general , the hem comprise a set of infinitely coupled equations , that can be ordered in a heirarchy , much as the bogoliubov - born - green - kirkwood - yvon ( bbgky ) hierarchy of classical statistical mechanics .",
    "one must then set equations for products or correlation of increasing number of operators . in order to close the system of equations ,",
    "a truncation of the hierarchy is necessary .",
    "we use the truncation scheme @xmath45 .",
    "it is important to note that the photon - exciton coupling is not affected by the truncation scheme ; therefore , the formation of polaritons ( strong - coupling regime ) is accurately described .",
    "the system - bath coupling is properly introduced in the hem by the formalism of quantum heisenberg - langevin equations , which leads to additional terms in the equations : damping , lamb shift , and stochastic force @xmath46 .",
    "a simpler way to deal with the environment is by introducing constants , taken from experiments or other theoretical works , directly in the hem , taking into account the results of the detailed microscopic derivation .",
    "here we follow the phenomenological procedure , by adding constants directly in the hem @xcite .",
    "photons are coupled to the radiation field at zero temperature outside of the cavity , resulting in the addition of a term @xmath47 ; the damping @xmath48 becomes very large when @xmath49 is such that the normal component of the field exceeds the critical angle separating low and high dbr reflectivity .",
    "for excitons we introduced a term @xmath50 , with a spin - dependent constant @xmath51 , accounting for radiative recombination and spin flip ( no scattering is considered ) .",
    "for the impurity spin , a general constant @xmath52 is used in all component , since no extenal magnetic field exists to distinguish among them . for long times ,",

    "there is a remaining oscillating population of excitons and photons . for certain values of the pulse parameters , these populations are so small ( @xmath98 ) that can not produce important changes in the spin .",
    "when decoherence is included , there is conversion to dark states @xmath99 , due to hole spin - flip , and to a lesser extent due to electron spin - flip . because of the long life - time of these dark states , the fraction @xmath100 remains finite ( though very small compared to its peak value ) .",

    "the addition of decoherence allows us to address the regimes of strong and weak coupling , and in particular to study the effect that cavity losses have in the spin control .",
    "weak coupling is characterized by @xmath122 ( in our case @xmath123 ps@xmath96 ) , and this regime can be simulated by increasing the photon losses of all modes ( increasing @xmath124 ) , which amounts to considering different cavities with varying quality factor q. two notes of caution : first , we have treated the laser - photon coupling in the quasimode approximation , valid for high - quality - factor cavities .",
    "therefore , we will refrain from studying cases with large values of @xmath124 .",
    "second , the laser - photon coupling @xmath125 is , in general , affected by changes in the photon losses @xmath124 ; however , we can envisage situations where one can increase @xmath124 without affecting @xmath125 , for example but not exclusively by reducing only the reflectivity of the left dbr in fig .",

    "we observe that for @xmath133 ps@xmath96 ( @xmath134 ) there is almost full rotation of @xmath119 , and that for lower quality - factor cavities ( high @xmath124 ) the spin changes little .",
    "the population of cavity photons and excitons follow this tendency .",

    "@xmath140ps@xmath96 and @xmath141ps@xmath96 the resulting fidelity is @xmath142 and @xmath143 , respectively .",
    "we interpret the enhanced rotation in high - q cavities in the following way . for high q , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : s_phescape ] , the photon density is larger , and a repetitive and longer interaction with excitons is possible .",
    "this leads concomitantly to the formation of polaritons , with the excitonic component causing impurity spin rotations .",
    "in contrast , for lower values of q , photons tend to leave the cavity faster , and there is small conversion to excitons . as was mentioned before , it is perhaps easier to envisage a cavity , whose q factor is lowered by degrading the left dbr in fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] .",
    "then , a naive picture tells us that the laser field produces photons inside the cavity at the same rate in the high and moderate q cases . in the latter ,",
    "photons are more prompt to leak out and produce less excitons .",
    "in addition , we can ask what the pulse width @xmath144 should be to ensure a full rotation of @xmath119 , for different values of cavity loss ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : s_width ] ) .",
    "as expected from the previous analysis , we see that one requires longer pulses to produce the rotation , but in contrast to what happened before , the fidelity is almost unchanged .",
    "we attribute the behavior of @xmath136 to the fact that the only source of decoherence is photon loss in these simulations and that the final state is forced ( by changing @xmath144 ) to be the closest possible to the ideal state .",
    "( solid blue ) required to produce full rotation of the @xmath119 spin component , and corresponding fidelity @xmath136 ( dashed red ) as a function of cavity loss @xmath124 . ]",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning that we have used a conservative value for @xmath79 .",
    "for example , puri _",
    "et al_@xcite reports a much higher value of @xmath79 for qds replacing impurities .",
    "this would lead to even faster spin control , together with more efficient control on @xmath89 .",
    "however , fs laser pulses have a broad frequency spectrum , and may excite several polariton modes .",
    "this may lead to destructive interference effects , which may reduce the effectiveness of a large @xmath79 .",
    "we studied the optical control of single spins in micro - cavities accounting for all sources of decoherence .",
    "when the system is in the strong - coupling regime , the spin manipulation is most efficient and can be done by a few - picoseconds laser pulse .",
    "this suggests that single spins embedded in high q - factor planar cavities can act as quantum memories and as qubits , with the optical excitation being the mechanism to control the state of the memory or to perform one - qubit operations for quantum computing .",
    "this optical control produces high - fidelity final states in very short time : a single operation can be performed @xmath145 faster than the typical decoherence time of the impurity spin qubit ( compared to other proposals using for example ion traps@xcite ) with a fidelity of @xmath146 .",
    "we believe that the present proposal for one - qubit operations , together with a previous one for implementing two - qubit operations in the same system@xcite show that polaritons in 2d - microcavities is a promising system for the implementation of solid - state quantum - computing scalable architectures .",
