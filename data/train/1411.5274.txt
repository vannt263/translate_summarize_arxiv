    "anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) , along with soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) are extremely magnetized neutron stars ( magnetars ) powered by the decay of their strong magnetic fields .",
    "these sources exhibit numerous unusual characteristics , such as , relatively slow rotation speeds , high spin - down rates , bright persistent x - ray emission and , for most of them , episodic bursts seen in x - rays .",
    "the dipole magnetic field strengths , inferred from their spin periods and spin down rates are indeed extremely high , which are sufficient to account for their observed unique properties @xcite .",
    "long term spin behaviour of magnetars usually do not follow a secular trend , likely due to large magnetic torques along with episodic wind outflow that could take place in strongly magnetized environments @xcite . additionally , sudden increase in the angular velocity ( i.e. , glitches ) has been observed from several axps .",
    "however , glitch events in axps have peculiar differences compared to the properties of glitches from rotation powered pulsars : e1048 is one of the most variable axp both in timing and radiative behaviour as several short energetic burst and flare events were observed @xcite .",
    "its 2007 flare event was coincident with a large glitch @xcite .",
    "similarly , went into an active period , exhibiting six bursts and a glitch event which was over - recovered , causing the neutron star to rotate slower than the pre - glitch level @xcite .",
    "another axp showing coincident burst and glitch event is @xcite . on the other hand , and have experienced glitches , but there has been no evidence of accompanying radiative enhancements in these sources @xcite .    in , an outburst has been associated with a glitch @xcite .",
    "more interestingly , this source exhibited a sudden decrease in its angular velocity , namely an anti - glitch @xcite , within two weeks of a hard x - ray burst @xcite .",
    "the sudden spin - down trend in this axp occurred in conjunction with a doubled persistent source flux , as reported by @xcite .",
    "these authors also report that the observed anti - glitch was followed by either a glitch event @xmath090 d later or by a second anti - glitch @xmath050 d apart which was suggested as a more plausible explanation based on a bayesian approach @xcite .",
    "unlike glitches observed from isolated neutron stars , which are generally attributed to an internal mechanism ( e.g , * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the anti - glitch event was explained in terms of external effects , including magnetospheric processes @xcite or the accretion of orbiting objects @xcite .",
    "has a pulse period of @xmath011.8 s. it is a bright persistent x - ray source with an emission spectrum extending into hard x - rays , up to about 150 kev @xcite .",
    "it is also a source of several short energetic magnetar bursts @xcite .",
    "three glitches have been observed from with amplitudes ranging from @xmath010@xmath6 hz to 1.2@xmath310@xmath4 hz @xcite .",
    "note that these events were radiatively silent , i.e , there was no significant variations of the radiative behaviour of the source associated with these timing anomalies @xcite .",
    "the persistent x - ray emission of has remained constant during the duration of energetic bursts @xcite .    here , we present the results of long - term timing analysis of using rossi x - ray timing explorer ( _ rxte _ ) observations spanning @xmath05.5 years . in the following section , we introduce these _ rxte _ observations and our data analysis scheme .",
    "in  [ sect : results ] , we present the results of our detailed temporal investigations , and report on the discovery of an anti - glitch and additional glitch from this source .",

    "tab : antiglitch ]    as we noted earlier , pulse phase modeling of the segment 2 with a fourth order polynomial yields an unacceptable fit statistics ( see panel c of figure  [ fig : antiglitch ] ) , while increasing the order of polynomial results in unconstrained spin parameters . for this reason",
    ", we also modeled the phases of this segment with a glitch model .",
    "we find that an ordinary glitch model fit does not improve the fit statistics .",
    "however , a glitch with a negative amplitude ( i.e. , an anti - glitch ) of @xmath8 @xmath0@xmath55@xmath310@xmath9 hz provides a significant improvement in fit statistics ( @xmath10/dof = 16.3/19 ) ; a @xmath11 of 21.5 for the same number of dof as the polynomial model fit . based on this , we conclude that exhibited an anti - glitch near mjd 54656 , that is @xmath01 yr after glitch 4 .",
    "we list the parameters of the anti - glitch model fit in table  [ tab : antiglitch ] .",
    "note that fit results suggesting the anti - glitch epoch between mjd 54645 and 54662 yield similar fit statistics , indicating that the anti - glitch occurred in this time interval . in the top panel of figure  [ fig : antiglitch ]",
    "we present the frequency evolution of the source in this segment . to show the sudden deviation of the spin frequency , we fit a linear trend to the frequencies prior to mjd @xmath054650 and extrapolated this fit to the rest of this segment ( see panel b in figure  [ fig : antiglitch ] ) .",
    "we found that the spin - down rate before mjd 54630 and after mjd 54670 are consistent with one another ( @xmath52.84(1)@xmath310@xmath12 and @xmath52.86(1)@xmath310@xmath12 hz  s@xmath13 , respectively ) .",
    "the average spin - down rate during the @xmath040 d in between is about @xmath53@xmath310@xmath12 hz  s@xmath13 .",
    "we also present the phase residuals of the anti - glitch involving model in the panel d of figure   [ fig : antiglitch ] .    54630 , and extrapolated onwards .",

    "we therefore conclude that the system exhibits higher level of timing noise , likely related to the emission of numerous energetic bursts during these episodes ( see figure [ fig : resfreqpcount ] ) .    finally , in order to search for radiative variabilities we performed pulsed count rate analysis as explained in @xcite .",
    "we found that pulsed count rate of the source is constant over @xmath05.5 yr of _ rxte _ observations ( see , third panel of figure   [ fig : resfreqpcount ] ) .",
    "was observed @xmath013 yr by _",
    "rxte_. here we performed timing analysis of using @xmath05 yr of _ rxte _ observations .",
    "previous @xmath07.6 yr has been analysed by @xcite and 3 glitches have been reported .",
    "the largest glitch observed from this source has an amplitude of @xmath01.2@xmath310@xmath4 hz with a recovery timescale of 43 days and fractional increase of 0.1 in its spin - down rate .",
    "consequent two glitches have amplitudes on the order of @xmath010@xmath6 hz without any observable exponential recovery .",
    "there is no evidence of accompanying radiative enhancements during all three glitch epochs .    through our detailed investigations of _ rxte _ monitoring of spanning over five years , we have identified two timing events separated by @xmath01 yr : a glitch and an anti - glitch. the glitch event has occurred at mjd @xmath054303 with an amplitude of @xmath8@xmath04@xmath310@xmath6 hz without any observable exponential recovery . note that this is the fourth glitch identified from this source : one of the earlier three has an amplitude of @xmath010@xmath4 hz with a recovery timescale of 43 days @xcite , while the other two were at similar amplitudes and showed no exponential recovery .",
    "similar to the three earlier glitch episodes in , we found no associated radiative enhancement deduced from the pulsed x - ray flux measurement ( bottom panels of figure   [ fig : resfreqpcount ] and 2 ) .",
    "the second event , an anti - glitch seen from for the first time , has occurred at mjd @xmath054656 with an amplitude of @xmath8@xmath0@xmath55@xmath310@xmath9 hz .",
    "the amplitude of the only other anti - glitch event observed from @xcite is strikingly similar .",
    "we found that the source experienced an elevated spin - down rate over about 40 days , and @xmath14 returned back to the pre - anti - glitch level after mjd 54670 .",
    "note that the average spin - down rate in the elevated regime is about @xmath53@xmath3@xmath15 hz  s@xmath13 , which is similar to the @xmath14 values exhibited by the source over @xmath0150 d following an energetic burst on mjd 55322.6 ( see the middle panel of figure  [ fig : resfreqpcount ] ) .",
    "both pulsed x - ray emission ( see the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : antiglitch ] ) and the 0.5 - 10 kev flux ( see figure 3 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of the source remain constant during the anti - glitch episode , similar to the case for the fourth glitch .    according to the standard pulsar glitch models",

    "* ) , a faster rotating superfluid transfers angular momentum to the crust which results in positive increment in the observed spin frequency of the neutron star .",
    "@xcite statistically determined that superfluid vortex unpinning model with a constant fractional vortex density , which is the fraction of vortex density involved in the glitch event , provides the most plausible explanation for glitches observed from rotation powered pulsars . in this model ,",
    "the number of glitches in a given time span that a pulsar would experience is related to the constant fractional vortex density , the ratio of the spin - down rate and frequency of the pulsar . from previous observations and glitches observed from we determined the fractional vortex density as 2.90@xmath310@xmath16 .",
    "note that this is consistent with fractional vortex density for @xcite . using this parameter for and an average value of the ratio of the spin - down rate to the frequency yield the expected number of glitches from this magnetar during the entire 13 yr of _ rxte _ observation span as 4.5 . with the fourth glitch we uncovered in this study ,",
    "our results are in agreement with the expectations of the vortex unpinning model .",
    "recent observation of the anti - glitch from implies a neutron star superfluid interior rotating slower than the crust within the context of standard pulsar glitch models @xcite .",
    "it was suggested that the rotation of the superfluid can be slowed down by crustal deformations due to magnetic stresses in highly magnetized sources @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that and might have had episodes of accelerated spin - down due to the fact that they are older than their associated supernovae remnants as inferred by their characteristic ages . in @xcite",
    "they also propose a particle outflow scheme to account for the sudden spin - down behaviour of sgr 1900 + 14 @xcite , in conjunction with its august 27 giant flare .",
    "however , there was no indication of particle outflow from around the time of the anti - glitch @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the particle outflow scenario was discarded .",
    "alternatively , there are already a couple of magnetospheric models suggested to understand the origin of the anti - glitch : @xcite proposed that the sudden spin - down and in general variable spin - down trends are caused by the changes in torque due to transient opening of a small region of the twisted magnetosphere during the x - ray burst . @xcite",
    "have applied the wind braking scenario @xcite to magnetars in the case that the rotational energy of the star is mainly extracted via a constant particle wind from the star . in this model",
    "an anti - glitch corresponds to an enhanced state of the particle wind @xcite .",
    "both partial magnetospheric opening and wind breaking models require radiative enhancements accompanying the anti - glitch , which was the case for as its x - ray flux increased by at least a factor of two in association with the anti - glitch @xcite .",
    "our results , however , place an indirect constraint on both models since we found no observable variations in the pulsed x - ray emission from at the time of its anti - glitch .",
    "nevertheless , occasional detection of energetic bursts from indicate that its magnetosphere is active and not all but some x - ray bursts may lead to a magnetospheric rearrangement that could lead to the episodic rapid spin - down as prescribed by @xcite .",
    "note the fact that we became aware of the paper by @xcite during the review stage of our paper .",
    "they fit a very wide data segment ( spanning more than 1200 d and including our suggested anti - glitch ) with a fifth - order polynomial , and find an rms of 0.041 , which is much larger than that for any other segment .",
    "even with the fifth - order polynomial fit , large fluctuations in the phase residuals are clearly visible ( see panel ( c ) around mjd 54600 of figure 1c in @xcite ) .",
    "they make no emphasis on this significant timing anomaly , which we interpret as an anti - glitch .",
