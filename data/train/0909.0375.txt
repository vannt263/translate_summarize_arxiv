    "quantum entanglement plays an essential role in quantum information science @xcite . however , entanglement is very fragile due to the influence of the environment , which is recognized as the major obstacle for the final application of quantum information processing .",
    "for example , a phenomenon called `` entanglement sudden death '' @xcite shows that two initially entangled qubits may disentangle completely in a finite time due to spontaneous emission .",
    "so in order to keep the atomic entanglement for a long time , spontaneous emission should be suppressed .",
    "several ways were proposed for this purpose .",
    "one way widely applied is to place the qubits in a structured environment , say , microcavity @xcite or in the photonic band gap of photonic crystals @xcite , such that the qubits are separated from the environment .",
    "another way is to dynamically control the coupling between the system and the environment , by , e.g. , quantum zeno effect @xcite . in practice",
    ", people may combine the two ways @xcite .",
    "in fact , the two methods have something in common .    in this paper , we investigate the entanglement dynamics of two two - level atoms in a common cavity , a non - markovian environment .",
    "we find that when the atoms are on or near resonant with the cavity , the speed of the disentanglement decreases as the quality factor of the cavity decreases , and when the atoms are far - off - resonant with the cavity , the speed of the disentanglement increases as the quality factor of the cavity decreases .",
    "these phenomena can be related to quantum zeno @xcite and anti - zeno effect @xcite .",
    "consider two spontaneously emitting two - level atoms with a common zero - temperature bosonic reservoir , and in the lamb - dicke limit @xcite , the dipole - dipole interaction is negligible . under the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) , the hamiltonian of this composite system plus the reservoir is given by ( @xmath0 ) @xcite : @xmath1 with @xmath2 @xmath3 here , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the inversion operators and transition frequency of the @xmath6th qubit ( @xmath7 ) , and @xmath8 , @xmath9 are the annihilation and creation operators of the field mode of the reservoir .",
    "the mode index @xmath10 contains several variables which are two orthogonal polarization indices and the propagation vector @xmath11 . to measure the coupling strength of the atoms to the cavity mode determined by the atom s relative position in the cavity ,",
    "we introduce the dimensionless constant @xmath12 @xcite . in the following discussion , we introduce vacuum rabi frequency @xmath13 and relative coupling strengthes @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) .    for an initial state of the form",
    "@xmath16 since @xmath17 = 0 $ ] , where @xmath18 , the time evolution of the total system is confined to the subspace spanned by the bases @xmath19 : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the state of the reservoir with only one exciton in the @xmath10th mode . here",
    ", we consider the case in which the two atoms have the same bohr frequency , i.e. , @xmath22 .",

    "the spectral density function takes the form @xmath29,\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the transition strength , @xmath31 is the center of the spectrum , and @xmath32 is the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the spectral function . by employing fourier",
    "transform and residue theorem , we get the explicit form @xmath33 , where the quantity @xmath34 is the reservoir correlation time .    using laplace transform",
    ", we get the solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ eq3a ] ) and ( [ eq3b ] ) :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 are the roots of the equation for @xmath39 : @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the detuning . in the @xmath42 basis ,",
    "the reduced density matrix of the two atoms is given by : @xmath43    the entanglement of the two atoms can be evaluated by concurrence @xmath44 @xcite . for @xmath45 [ eq .",
    "( [ rhoa ] ) ] , its concurrence can be derived from @xcite , as @xmath46",
    "we focus on the concurrence as a function of time @xmath47 in weak - coupling regime , @xmath48 . in this regime ,",
    "the concurrence of the two atoms undergoes nearly irreversible exponential decay .",
    "similar behaviors mentioned below take place for strong - coupling regime in the time scale of rabi oscillation .",
    "we compare the entanglement dynamics of the two atoms initially in the maximal entanglement states @xmath49 for three different values of full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the spectral function , namely , @xmath50 .    as mentioned in @xcite , it is hard to exactly control the position of the atom in the optical cavity .",
    "but through numerical stimulation , we find that different values of @xmath51 show qualitatively similar behaviors .",
    "so , for simplicity , we focus on the case of equal coupling parameters , i.e. , @xmath52 .     and ( b ) @xmath53 , both with the initial state being the maximal entanglement state @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , for the cases of ( i ) @xmath57 ( solid blue curve ) , ( ii ) @xmath58 ( dotted green curve ) , ( iii ) @xmath59 ( dashed red curve ) .,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    as in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , the atoms are on resonance with the center of the spectrum , @xmath60 .",
    "the concurrence decreases monotonically down to zero at the beginning .",
    "an interesting phenomenon is that the speed of disentanglement decreases as @xmath61 increases .",
    "similar behavior happens when the atoms are near resonance with the center of the spectrum , @xmath62 .",
    "in fact , this phenomenon is related to the environment induced quantum zeno effect @xcite . however , when the atoms are far off - resonant with the center of the spectrum , @xmath63 , for example , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , where we choose @xmath64 , the speed of disentanglement increases as @xmath61 increases .",
    "this latter phenomenon is related to the anti - zeno effect @xcite .",
    "in fact , as mentioned in @xcite , if the coupling strengths of the two atoms to the field are different and the dipole - dipole interaction is not negligible , there are no asymptotic entanglement , which means that even @xmath65 will disentangle completely . in these cases , our numerical stimulation shows that similar phenomena mentioned above happen .",
    "we can give an intuitive explanation for these phenomena . as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the center part of the spectrum decreases monotonically as @xmath61 increases , while the parts which are far from the center increases as @xmath61 increases .",
    "we can prove that the short - time behavior of the disentanglement is determined by the modes of the spectrum which are on resonance with the atoms : the speed of the disentanglement decreases ( increases ) as the density of these modes decreases ( increases ) .",
    "similar to @xcite , we define @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the effective decay rate . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq5a ] ) , ( [ eq5b ] ) and ( [ concurrence ] ) , we can see that @xmath68 and @xmath67 can describe the concurrence to some extent . for short - time behavior , in the first - order approximation , one yields @xcite :    @xmath69    since @xmath70 is a sharply steep function of @xmath71 around @xmath72 , if the width of @xmath70 is much smaller than that of @xmath73 , @xmath67 is mainly determined by @xmath74 . in this paper ,",
    "the form of @xmath73 is given by eq .",
    "( [ spectrum ] ) .",
    "then a detailed analysis shows that if @xmath61 is larger than @xmath75 , @xmath74 is a monotonic decreasing function with respect to @xmath61 , otherwise , it is a monotonic increasing function with respect to @xmath61 . since @xmath76 , these results also go to @xmath67 .    , @xmath55 , for the cases of ( i ) @xmath57 ( solid blue curve ) , ( ii ) @xmath58 ( dotted green curve ) , ( iii ) @xmath59 ( dashed red curve ) .,scaledwidth=40.0%",
    "in order to relate these phenomena to environment induced quantum zeno and anti - zeno effect , we make a transform on the original hamiltonian [ eq . ( [ hamiltonian ] ) ] as in @xcite : @xmath77 @xmath78 we get @xmath79 @xmath80 @xmath81,\\ ] ] @xmath82},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the creation and annihilation operators for the discrete quasimode , with the frequency @xmath31 , and @xmath85 , @xmath86 are those for the continuum quasimodes with the frequency @xmath87 .",
    "it can be seen , from the above hamiltonian , that the composite two - atom system only interacts with one discrete mode and their coupling coefficient is just the transition strength @xmath30 .",
    "the discrete mode interacts with the continuum modes and their coupling strength only contains the width ( @xmath61 ) of the lorentzian spectral density which is a constant .",
    "this means that if we let the two atoms and the discrete mode be a new system and the continuum modes be the reservoir , the behavior of the new system is exactly markovian . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "the discrete mode is appropriate for describing the electromagnetic field inside the cavity , and the continuum modes are appropriate for describing the field outside the cavity .    in terms of quantum measurement theory",
    "@xcite , the continuum quasimodes @xmath88 represent the environment , the discrete quasimode @xmath84 represent the meter , and the two atoms are the system . by interpreting the environment as a photoelectron counter",
    ", the coupling strength of interaction between the discrete quasimode and the continuum quasimodes relates to the rate of photon counting @xmath61 .",
    "that means the environment acts as an observer of the pointer states of discrete quasimode .",
    "although , in our model , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are not perfect pointer states for discrete quasimode , the observation by the environment destroys the coherence between them .",
    "we can interpret @xmath91 as the effective measurement interval by the environment .",
    "assume that the two atoms and the discrete quasimode are in the state @xmath92 in the beginning .",
    "for simplicity , we choose @xmath93 , then because of the interaction between the atoms and the quasimode , at a subsequent time @xmath94 , they evolve to the state @xmath95 , and the probability of the transition @xmath96 is @xmath97 . in the meantime ,",
    "the coherence of this superposition is destroyed by the environment .",
    "then the probability of the transition after a time @xmath98 is @xmath99 .",
    "so , we can see that this probability is proportion to @xmath100 .",
    "it explains the phenomenon that the speed of disentanglement decreases as the strength of damping increases . in terms of quantum measurement theory , this means that the observation made by the environment suppress the disentanglement , which is just quantum zeno effect .",
    "when @xmath75 is much larger than @xmath61 , that means the frequency of the observation is very small , and in the language in @xcite , we can say that the observations are made in the anti - zeno regime , so the observations accelerate the disentanglement . a similar discussion about the zeno and anti - zeno effect for nonresonant systems is given in @xcite , where the observations are not made by the environment .    in conclusion",
    ", we extend the study of the entanglement dynamics of two atoms in a common cavity .",
    "we find that the speed of the disentanglement of the two atoms is a decreasing ( increasing ) function of the damping rate of the cavity when the atoms are on / near resonance ( far off resonance ) with the center of the cavity modes .",
    "we give a quantitative explanation for these phenomena , and relate them to quantum zeno and anti - zeno effect induced by the environment .",
    "these results are helpful for understanding the related experimental phenomena and for the practical engineering of entanglement in the future .",
