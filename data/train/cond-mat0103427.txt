    "according to finite size scaling theory , the conducance of a finite random resistor network is expected to vary with the system size : = l^-t[a + b f(l ) ] [ eq : eq1 ] here @xmath2 @xcite is the conductivity exponent and @xmath3 is the correction to scaling term which vanishes as the size of the system becomes infinite @xcite.in this work we study the behavior of the correction - to - scaling for finite systems that can be simulated on a computer .",
    "recently grassberger @xcite numerically studied the conductance of random resistor networks on the square lattice by numerical simulations for @xmath4 .",
    "he found that for bond percolation networks the corrections - to - scaling are nonmonotonic : there is a dip in the corrections - to - scaling present at small lattice sizes .",
    "even though this effect is rather weak , it can be clearly distinguished by high precision numerical simulations . in the site",
    "percolation networks this behavior is absent .",
    "grassberger showed that the bond percolation data could be fitted to the log - periodic form @xmath5 and pointed out that only the comparison with site percolation resistor networks enables us to reject this . because this behavior is not understood we wanted to investigate it further by studying systems defined on different lattices .",
    "one question we ask is whether this behavior is the result of the strong shape dependence of the probability distribution of conductances for small system sizes . to answer this we simulated square lattice percolating networks and calculated the arithmetic , geometric and harmonic means ( grassberger @xcite used the arithmetic",
    "mean to obtain the conductance ) .",
    "another question is whether the oscillations are universal or particular to the square lattice used in @xcite . to test the universality we also simulated bond percolation resistor networks on triangular and honeycomb lattices .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we give the details of our numerical work and present our results , section 3 contains the discussion and conclusions .",
    "the systems we study are random resistor networks that are connected to perfectly conducting busbars at the two opposite edges of the array , while the transverse boundaries are free . to simulate a random resistor network we start with a bond percolation network and assign unit conductance to the bonds that are present while a missing bond gives zero conductance .",
    "the calculation of the network conductance for a given configuration of conductances is done by the lobb - frank algorithm @xcite , which uses a succession of star - triangle ( st ) and triangle - star ( ts ) transformations to reduce the network to an equivalent chain of resistors .",
    "our square lattice simulations were performed on rectangles @xmath6 , with the perfectly conducting busbars placed at @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "this means that the lattice ( busbars excluded ) has dimensions @xmath9 .",
    "the reason for this choice is to ensure that the bond system is self - dual ( see ref . 3 and references therein ) .",
    "to simulate systems on a triangular lattice we add a diagonal resistor to each unit cell of the square lattice without changing the position of the busbars .",
    "this way of representing the triangular network changes the geometry of the system - effectively the shape of the boundary becomes a rhombus @xcite .",
    "simulations on the honeycomb lattice are done by starting with a honeycomb resistor network and replacing the leftmost column of resistors with perfect conductors and attaching the rightmost column of nodes to a perfectly conducting busbar .",
    "the pictures of these networks can be found in ref .",
    "the systems were taken to be at the percolation threshold , where @xmath10 for square lattice , @xmath11 for the triangular lattice and @xmath12 for the honeycomb lattice @xcite .",
    "for the square lattice the conductance was obtained by exact enumeration for @xmath13 , while for the triangular lattice exact enumeration was used to obtain the result for @xmath14 . for other system sizes",
    "the number of random configurations generated was at least @xmath15 .",
    "our results for the square lattice are shown in fig .",
    "1 , for the triangular lattice in fig . 2 and for the honeycomb lattice in fig .",
    "we plot the conductance multiplied by @xmath1 raised to the conductivity exponent @xmath16 as a function of @xmath1 on a semilogarithmic scale .",
    "= 3.in    in these figures full points ( circles )",
    "are obtained by using the arithmetic mean , stars are obtained from the geometric mean and crosses correspond to the harmonic mean ( where the averages are computed using only the samples with nonzero conductance ) .",
    "the errors are smaller than the size of the points on the graphs .",
    "the points in fig . 1 obtained by the arithmetic mean match the data obtained by grassberger in @xcite .",
    "let us first consider our results for the networks defined on a square lattice .    the data obtained by using the arithmetic mean start at a low value for the lowest lattice size @xmath17 and then there is a jump to a high value at lattice size @xmath18 followed by the monotonic decrease up to @xmath19 .",
    "if we use the harmonic or geometric mean the jump is not present - @xmath20 is a monotonically decreasing function until it reaches a minimum .",
    "thus the behavior at @xmath21 is affected by the peculiar ( and very discrete ) distribution of conductances .    in all three cases",
    "a minimum is present at low @xmath1 .",
    "our numerical investigation of conduction on a square lattice shows that the dip in the correction - to - scaling term for small systems does not get averaged out by using different means to obtain the conductance .",
    "we did not find the anomalous behavior for the systems defined on triangular and honeycomb lattices .",
    "the dip at small @xmath1 is not present and the behavior is quite similar to those obtained in ref . 1 for the case of site percolation on a square lattice .",
    "the anomaly present in the case of square lattice is rather weak - only high precision simulations are able to reveal it .",
    "we notice that changing @xmath1 by a fraction of the lattice spacing will strongly affect the behavior of @xmath20 for small @xmath1 while the large @xmath1 results will be practically unaffected . replacing @xmath1 by @xmath22 as the independent variable gives a monotonic function for @xmath23 ; for @xmath24 the corrections - to - scaling behave qualitatively in the same way as the results obtained for the other systems mentioned above ( ziff @xcite used a similar constant in connection with crossing probability problems ) . this is illustrated in fig .",
    "4 .      in the case of triangular and honeycomb systems the rescaling of @xmath1 does not qualitatively change the behavior of @xmath20 - in particular , the oscillation at small @xmath1 does not occur .",
    "this is shown in fig . 5 and fig . 6 for triangular and honeycomb lattices , respectively .",
    "the justification for this adjustment of @xmath1 is that the theory is formulated in the continuum limit while the discrete systems we simulated have the smallest scale equal to the lattice spacing . while for the large systems this should not matter",
    ", the small system results might be affected by this if we are doing very precise simulations ."
