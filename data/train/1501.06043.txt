    "the closure of a set @xmath4 is denoted @xmath5 , and the boundary is denoted @xmath6 .",
    "all our graphs are finite and may ( and frequently do ) have multiple edges or loops .",
    "an _ embedding _ of a graph in a surface maps each vertex to a point and each edge to a simple arc or simple closed curve , so that the only pairwise intersections of those points and arcs correspond to the incidences between an edge and its endvertices . for convenience",
    ", we usually do not distinguish between a vertex or edge of a graph and its image in a graph embedding .",
    "a _ face _ of a graph embedding is a connected component of the topological subspace of the surface obtained by deleting the images of all vertices and edges . if two embeddings of a graph are related by a homeomorphism of the surface we consider them to be equivalent .",
    "we typically use @xmath7 to denote not just a graph , but a graph embedding , with vertex set @xmath8 , edge set @xmath9 and face set @xmath10 ; @xmath11 denotes the underlying graph .",
    "a graph embedding in a surface is _ @xmath0-cell _ , _ open @xmath0-cell _ or _ cellular _ if every face is an open disk .",
    "a @xmath0-cell embedding is a _",
    "closed @xmath0-cell _ embedding if every face is bounded by a simple closed curve ; equivalently , the boundary walk of each face is a cycle in the graph .",
    "the graph is necessarily nonseparable , so if it has at least two edges it has no loops and no cutvertices .",
    "( there is some ambiguity in the definition of ` closed @xmath0-cell ' in the literature .",
    "the definition we use is the one given by barnette @xcite in what seems to be the first mention of the concept .",
    "another common definition is that the closure of every face is a closed disk ; this is not quite the same , because it allows the boundary of a face , considered as a subgraph , to be a cycle with attached trees . for @xmath0-connected graphs the two definitions are equivalent .",
    "our graphs , however , are not necessarily @xmath0-connected so it is important to be clear about which definition we are using . )    because all faces in a @xmath0-cell embedding are homeomorphic to an open disk , we can describe such an embedding without giving topological information for each face .",
    "in fact , it is well known that @xmath0-cell embeddings can be described in a completely combinatorial way , using a _ rotation system _ with _ edge types _ or _",
    "edge signatures_. see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3.2 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sections 3.2 , 3.3 ) .",
    "a @xmath0-cell embedding can also be described in a number of other ways , including as a _ band decomposition _ or as a _ reduced band decomposition _ , also called a _ ribbon graph_. we assume the reader is familiar with these different representations of graph embeddings .    for the remainder of this paper all embeddings will be @xmath0-cell embeddings of graphs in surfaces",
    ". we will sometimes mention this explicitly , but often just assume it implicitly . since our surfaces are connected , these are necessarily embeddings of connected graphs .",
    "it is well known that for every @xmath0-cell graph embedding @xmath7 there is a unique _ dual _ graph embedding @xmath12 ( sometimes called the _ geometric dual _ ) in the same surface , obtained as follows .",
    "insert one vertex of @xmath12 in each face of @xmath7 , and for each edge @xmath13 of @xmath7 add an edge @xmath14 in @xmath12 , crossing @xmath13 , which joins the vertices of @xmath12 corresponding to the faces on either side of @xmath13 . then @xmath12 is also @xmath0-cell , the faces of @xmath12 correspond to the vertices of @xmath7 and vice versa , and @xmath15 . since there is a bijection @xmath16 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are often thought of as the same object .",
    "we will distinguish between them only when necessary ( usually when considering them as actual curves in a surface ) .",
    "there are other duals for graph embeddings .",
    "for example , the _ petrie dual _ is formed by toggling the signature of every edge ( from @xmath17 to @xmath18 , or vice versa ) in a representation of the embedding in terms of rotation systems and edge signatures .",
    "it is clear that it is possible to do this in a partial fashion , by toggling the signatures for some subset of edges , instead of for all edges .",
    "taking the partial petrie dual is a useful operation .",
    "for example , the process used by the authors in @xcite to convert projective - planar embeddings into orientable closed @xmath0-cell embeddings , although described in that paper as a multistep process of inserting crosscaps , then cutting through them and capping off , is really just taking partial petrie duals .",
    "no one , however , seems to have considered a partial version of geometric duality for graph embeddings , until chmutov @xcite in 2009 .",
    "he was motivated the desire to unify several thistlethwaite - type theorems ; results of this type relate polynomials for knots or links to graph polynomials .",
    "he defines the partial dual , with respect to a subset of edges , for a signed graph , where each edge is assigned either @xmath19 or @xmath20 .",
    "his main result is an invariance formula for a certain specialization of the bollobs - riordan polynomial of signed graphs under partial duality .",
    "the bollobs - riordan polynomial is formulated in terms of ribbon graphs @xcite .",
    "chmutov s original definition of partial duality therefore used ribbon graphs , and another related representation for @xmath0-cell embeddings , which he calls an _",
    "arrow presentation_.    our interest is purely in the topological structure of a graph embedding under the partial duality operation , and we therefore ignore the part of chmutov s operation that involves changing the signs of edges , and just deal with unsigned graphs .",
    "several alternative constructions for chmutov s partial duality operation have appeared in the literature , and are summarized in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2.2 ) .",
    "all of these are based on ribbon graphs and arrow presentations .",
    "we will provide details of one of these constructions in section [ pd - gem - surf ] .",
    "section [ pd - gem - surf ] discusses two alternative representations of partial duality that do not use ribbon graphs or arrow presentations .",
    "the first uses the band decomposition representation of an embedding .",
    "the second uses a completely combinatorial representation of a graph embedding as a _ graph - encoded map _ , or _",
    "gem_. both of these definitions give explicit descriptions of the faces as well as the vertices of the partial dual , and demonstrate symmetry with respect to vertices and faces .    in section [ c2c ]",
    "we consider the question of whether a partial dual is closed @xmath0-cell .",
    "we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for a partial dual of a general graph embedding to be closed @xmath0-cell .",
    "this has a particularly simple form for initial embeddings that are closed @xmath0-cell and satisfy certain additional properties .",
    "we also obtain a sufficient condition for no partial dual to be closed @xmath0-cell .",
    "before we begin we offer an apology of sorts to the reader .",
    "much of our work is just manipulating definitions , and converting ideas from one representation of an embedding into another .",
    "we work with many different ways of looking at an embedding , and many related but not identical concepts , and the reader may find this confusing . unfortunately , this seems to be necessary to get anywhere in this area : different representations are useful for different purposes . we have tried to keep the notation as consistent as possible , to help the reader follow what is going on .",
    "in this section we discuss two representations of partial duality .",
    "graph embeddings can be described in many ways , and so there are also many ways to describe partial duality .",
    "the motivation of the two descriptions we give here is that they enable our work in section [ c2c ] , characterizing closed @xmath0-cell partial duals .",
    "the description in terms of band decompositions ( proposition [ bd - pd ] ) is convenient in situations where we deal with an actual embedding , rather than a model such as a ribbon graph .",
    "we specialize this to a particular type of band decomposition which we call a _ corner graph_. the description in terms of gems ( proposition [ gem - pd ] ) is very simple .",
    "we provide examples which we hope will be helpful for understanding .",
    "we briefly remind the reader how band decompositions and ribbon graphs of a graph embedding @xmath7 are found ; for a complete description see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* subsection 3.2.1 ) . for the _ band decomposition",
    "_ we ` fatten ' both vertices and edges into closed disks , known as _",
    "@xmath21-bands _ for the vertices , and _ @xmath22-bands _ for the edges ; each face then also corresponds to a closed disk , called a _",
    "@xmath0-band_. a _ reduced band decomposition _ or _",
    "ribbon graph _",
    "representation may then be obtained by discarding the @xmath0-bands .    for adjacent edges of @xmath7 , their @xmath22-bands may or may not intersect , at a point .",
    "we can modify a band decomposition so that they always intersect , or always do not intersect . to allow adjacent @xmath22-bands to intersect when they are the same band , we loosen the definition of a @xmath22-band a little by allowing it to be a closed disk with two points on its boundary identified , or a closed disk with two pairs of points @xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 identified , where @xmath27 appear in that order around the boundary .",
    "we will describe a band decomposition or ribbon graph of a graph embedding @xmath7 in the following standard way .",
    "the @xmath21-bands will be denoted @xmath28 for @xmath29 ; @xmath30 is the interior of the band .",
    "similarly the @xmath22-bands will be denoted @xmath31 for @xmath32 , and the @xmath0-bands ( if we have them ) will be denoted @xmath33 for @xmath34 .",
    "the boundaries of the bands in a band decomposition @xmath35 of a connected graph embedding with at least one edge may be regarded as an embedded graph @xmath36 : the vertices are points where three or four bands ( one @xmath21-band , one @xmath0-band , and one or two @xmath22-bands ) meet , the boundary segments between these points define the edges , and the interiors of the bands are the faces . in @xmath36 ,",
    "every face @xmath30 is bounded by a cycle @xmath37 , every face @xmath38 is bounded by a cycle @xmath39 , and every face @xmath40 is bounded by a closed trail ( no repeated edges ) @xmath41 of length four , which is a cycle except possibly when @xmath13 is incident in @xmath7 with a vertex or face of degree one . if @xmath42 is a ribbon graph we form a band decomposition @xmath35 by gluing a @xmath0-band along every boundary component , and then define @xmath43 .",
    "we let @xmath44 and @xmath45 . for any @xmath46 we let @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the edges of each @xmath41 alternate between edges of @xmath50 and of @xmath51 .    the following may help the reader remember the notation above .",
    "we can think of colouring the edges of @xmath36 , generalizing the standard colouring of edges in a graph - encoded map , which we discuss later in this section .",
    "an edge between @xmath21- and @xmath22-bands is red , an edge between @xmath21- and @xmath0-bands is yellow , and an edge between @xmath22- and @xmath0-bands is blue .",
    "we use this colour coding consistently in our figures .",
    "the boundary of a @xmath21-band contains red edges and possibly some yellow edges , so we use the letter @xmath52 for _ crimson _ , a type of red .",
    "the boundary of a @xmath0-band contains blue edges and possibly some yellow edges , so we use the letter @xmath53 for _ azure _ , a type of blue .",

    "we use it as the basis for our example to illustrate proposition [ bd - pd ] .",

    "every corner @xmath117 is associated with a vertex @xmath118 of @xmath7 , a face @xmath119 of @xmath7 , and with an unordered pair @xmath120 of ( possibly equal ) edges of @xmath7 .",
    "it is also associated with an edge @xmath121 of @xmath100 .",
    "a corner can be thought of as marking the place where a vertex , a face and two edges of @xmath7 come together .",
    "the _ corner graph _ @xmath122 is a graph embedding with the corners of @xmath7 as its vertices . for edges we add a cycle @xmath37 of length @xmath123 around each vertex @xmath124 of @xmath7 , through the corners of @xmath124 in their order around @xmath124 , and a cycle @xmath39 of length @xmath125 inside each face @xmath103 of @xmath7 , through the corners of @xmath103 in their order around @xmath103 .",
    "then @xmath122 has three types of face : each @xmath29 is in a face @xmath30 with @xmath126 , each @xmath77 contains a face @xmath38 with @xmath127 , and each @xmath32 with endvertices @xmath128 and @xmath124 intersects a unique face @xmath40 of degree @xmath129 in addition to @xmath130 .",

    "the edges incident with a new vertex or face , and their order , are determined by applying @xmath157 to the edges of the appropriate cycle @xmath63 or @xmath76 .",

    "chmutov @xcite showed that a partial dual of an orientable embedding is always orientable .",
    "so knowing the rotation around each vertex , we can construct the partial dual embedding . in the nonorientable case , we must be more careful ; we need to know how the edges of a cycle @xmath41 , corresponding to edges , are traversed by the corresponding new vertices , so we can decide whether the corresponding edge in the dual is twisted ( signature @xmath18 ) or not . that is the information carried by the arrow presentation in chmutov s original formulation of partial duality ; in propositions [ rg - pd ] and [ bd - pd ] it is carried by the faces @xmath31 , which we never delete .",
    "we also consider a band decomposition where all @xmath22-bands are pairwise disjoint .",

    "we can clearly recover the graph embedding @xmath169 , and hence @xmath7 , by gluing a disk onto each bigon of @xmath184 .",

    "they have a generalization of proposition [ gem - pd ] in that context ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.11 ) .",
    "[ gem - pd ] suppose @xmath7 is a @xmath0-cell embedding of a connected graph @xmath7 , with gem @xmath184 .",
    "let @xmath46 .",
    "then the partial dual @xmath58 corresponds to a gem @xmath185 obtained by swapping the colours red and blue on each bigon of @xmath184 corresponding to an edge in @xmath59 .",
    "everything we write here involves sets of edges , but for brevity we just write @xmath186 instead of @xmath187 , for any subgraph @xmath186 of @xmath184 .",
    "let @xmath188 , @xmath189 and @xmath190 be the sets of red , yellow and blue edges in @xmath184 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath191 , @xmath192 , @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "then @xmath195 , @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath198 and @xmath199 are disjoint and their union is @xmath200 .",
    "we have @xmath201 , @xmath202 , and @xmath203 .",
    "suppose we take the partial dual ; we use results and notation from proposition [ bd - pd ] and its proof .",
    "we have @xmath204 .",
    "similarly , @xmath205 . and @xmath206 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath185 , @xmath207 , @xmath208 , and @xmath209 . in other words , we exchange red and blue on edges in @xmath210 , and leave other colours alone , as required .",
    "the description of partial duality in proposition [ gem - pd ] treats red and blue edges , and hence red - yellow and blue - yellow bigons , symmetrically , again illustrating that partial duality treats vertices and faces symmetrically .",
    "we provide an example in figures [ gem - pic ] and [ gem - vf ] . at left in figure [ gem - pic ]",
    "we see a small planar graph and its gem ( with colours indicated as red = solid , blue = dashed , and yellow = hollow ) .",
    "suppose we dualize @xmath211 .",
    "at right in figure [ gem - pic ] we see the original graph , with the dual edges shown as wavy edges , and the new gem . in figure [ gem - vf ]",
    "we have separated out the red - yellow and blue - yellow bigons in the partial dual , and we see that there are now three vertices and only one face .    in the figures ,",
    "the partial duality operations for gems and for the corner graph seem to be very similar , which is to be expected .",
    "the corner graph @xmath122 can be obtained from the coloured dual of the barycentric subdivision , which is also the embedded gem , by contracting yellow edges , which become the vertices of @xmath122 .",
    "then the red edges of @xmath184 become @xmath50 in @xmath122 , and the blue edges of @xmath184 become @xmath51 in @xmath122 .",
    "a number of properties of partial duals are very easy to handle using gems .",
    "for example , as mentioned earlier , chmutov showed that the orientability of an embedding is unaltered by taking a partial dual .",
    "this follows from the fact that an embedding is orientable if and only if its gem is bipartite @xcite : this is a fixed property of the underlying graph of the gem , and is not altered by swapping colours on red - blue bigons . also , ellis - monaghan and moffatt @xcite have extensively investigated the interaction between partial duality and partial petrie duality ; they call the combined effect _ twisted duality_. this can be handled using an extension to gems suggested by lins @xcite .",
    "he added a fourth set of edges to a gem , which we call green edges , adding two diagonals to each red - blue bigon so it becomes a red - blue - green _ trigon _ , isomorphic to @xmath212 .",
    "bonnington and little @xcite call the result a _ jewel _ ; we show a jewel in figure [ jewel ] ( with green indicated by heavy hollow edges ) .",
    "petrie duality is formulated very naturally in the jewel , as swapping blue and green in red - blue - green trigons : this can obviously be done for a subset of the edges as well as for the whole edge set .",
    "therefore , some aspects of twisted duality are easy to interpret using jewels : for example , twisted duality provides an action of the _ ribbon group _",
    "@xmath213 on embeddings with a fixed edge set @xmath214 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition 3.4 ) because we can permute the colours red , blue and green for each @xmath215 .",
    "closed @xmath0-cell embeddings are particularly nice because each face and vertex are incident at most once .",
    "they can be regarded as embeddings of nonseparable graphs with facewidth at least @xmath0 .",
    "the _ strong embedding conjecture _ @xcite says that every @xmath0-connected graph has a closed @xmath0-cell embedding in some surface .",
    "this implies the well - known _ cycle double cover conjecture _ @xcite , which says that every @xmath0-edge - connected graph has a _ cycle double cover _ ,",
    "i.e. , a set of cycles in the graph such that each edge is contained in exactly two of these cycles .",
    "being closed @xmath0-cell seems to be a property that is quite fragile under taking partial duals .",
    "if we start with a closed @xmath0-cell graph embedding , taking the partial dual of any single edge ( necessarily a _ link _ , or non - loop ) creates a loop , and a graph embedding with a loop and at least one other edge is not closed @xmath0-cell .",
    "( see ( * ? ? ? * subsection 1.7 ) or @xcite .",
    "a more general version of this situation is discussed following lemma [ global ] . )",
    "however , it is known that the ( full geometric ) dual of a closed @xmath0-cell embedding is always closed @xmath0-cell .",
    "therefore , we may wonder whether a closed @xmath0-cell embedding has any other closed @xmath0-cell partial duals besides its full dual .",
    "in this section we develop some theory that will allow us to provide examples of closed @xmath0-cell embeddings that have nontrivial partial duals that are closed @xmath0-cell , and to identify certain situations where the partial dual will not be closed @xmath0-cell . to do this we provide a necessary and sufficient condition based on the corner graph for an embedding to be closed @xmath0-cell .",
    "some parts of our condition are unfortunately not easy to check exactly , but stronger versions of these parts are easy to check , so we can obtain useful results .",
    "we also use an argument based on gems to say that some graph embeddings have no partial duals that are closed @xmath0-cell .",
    "what prevents an embedding from being closed @xmath0-cell is a _ bad vertex / face pair _",
    "@xmath216 : a vertex @xmath124 and face @xmath103 so that @xmath124 and @xmath103 are incident more than once .",
    "a _ good vertex / face pair _",
    "@xmath216 is one where @xmath124 and @xmath103 are incident at most once .",
    "the definition of a bad vertex / face pair is symmetric in faces and vertices , which is why the full dual of a closed @xmath0-cell embedding is closed @xmath0-cell .",
    "vertex / face incidences occur precisely at the corners of @xmath7 , so these conditions are easy to express using the corner graph @xmath122 : a bad vertex / face pair occurs if there are some @xmath37 and @xmath39 that intersect in two or more vertices of @xmath122 .",
    "it is also easy to express in terms of the gem : a bad vertex / face pair occurs if there are a red - yellow bigon and a blue - yellow bigon that share two or more yellow edges .",
    "therefore , for any particular @xmath7 and @xmath59 , we can use this corner graph condition or gem condition , along with proposition [ bd - pd ] or [ gem - pd ] , to easily determine whether @xmath58 is closed @xmath0-cell .",
    "however , we would like to provide some general conclusions .",
    "we do this by analyzing proposition [ bd - pd ] in more detail for corner graphs .",
    "suppose we have a graph embedding @xmath7 and its corner graph @xmath122 together in the same surface @xmath1 .",
    "we use the notation of the previous section for band decompositions , including our standard description .",
    "these now always refer to the corner graph @xmath122 .",
    "let @xmath46 and @xmath72 be our set of dual and primal edges , respectively .",
    "we now classify elements of @xmath7 and of @xmath122 based on the division between primal and dual edges .",
    "a vertex or face of @xmath7 is said to be _ primal - pure _ if all of its incident edges belong to @xmath217 , and _ dual - pure _ if all of its incident edges belong to @xmath59 . in either case",
    "we say it is _",
    "pure_. if at least one incident edge belongs to @xmath217 and at least one to @xmath59 , then we say a vertex or face of @xmath7 is _",
    "mixed_. recall that vertices of @xmath122 are corners of @xmath7 , and each @xmath218 has an associated @xmath219 , @xmath220 , and @xmath221 which is an unordered pair of ( possibly equal ) edges of @xmath7 .",
    "we say @xmath117 is _ @xmath222-primal - pure _ ( _ @xmath222-dual - pure _ ) if @xmath223 ( @xmath224 ) and exactly @xmath222 of @xmath124 or @xmath103 are pure ( so @xmath225 , @xmath22 or @xmath0 ) .",
    "we can drop either the @xmath222 or the primal / dual distinction , and talk about _ @xmath222-pure _ corners , _ primal - pure _ or _ dual - pure _ corners , or just _ pure _ corners .",
    "a corner that is not pure is _ mixed _ , which necessarily means that @xmath226 and @xmath227 , or vice versa , and that both @xmath124 and @xmath103 are mixed .",
    "we can map every walk @xmath228 in @xmath122 to a walk @xmath229 in @xmath7 .",
    "loosely , we project each edge of @xmath228 that parallels an edge of @xmath7 to that edge . we ignore edges of @xmath228 that cross edges of @xmath7 ; such edges stay at the same vertex of @xmath7 . more formally , suppose @xmath228 is represented as an alternating sequence of vertices and edges , @xmath230 in @xmath122 .",

    ". we can apply @xmath238 to the cycles @xmath63 .",
    "the @xmath239 are exactly the components of boundary walks of faces of the ( possibly non-@xmath0-cell , possibly disconnected ) graph embedding obtained from @xmath7 by deleting edges not in @xmath59 .",
    "we keep all vertices of @xmath7 even if they have no incident edges from @xmath59 ; some of the @xmath239 may be trivial walks consisting of a single vertex .    in @xmath7 ,",

    ", we now provide an example where corollary [ simplemain ] can be used to demonstrate that a nontrivial partial dual is closed @xmath0-cell . in figure",
    "[ torusgood ] we see an example of a closed @xmath0-cell embedding on the torus ( represented in the standard way as a rectangle , where we consider the top and bottom sides to be identified and the left and right sides to be identified ) .",
    "it is made up of eight diamonds ( copies of @xmath387 ) .",
    "we dualize the four diamonds oriented vertically ( dual edges are denoted by wavy curves , as usual )",
    ". then the pure vertices , pure faces , and totally primal or dual boundary walks are all similar to those shown in the figure .",
    "every pure vertex touches exactly one mixed face , and every pure face touches exactly one mixed vertex , so there are no exposed pure vertices or faces",
    ". every corner is mixed ( between two diamonds ) , @xmath0-pure ( four central corners inside each diamond ) , or @xmath22-pure ( remaining corners ) ; there are no @xmath21-pure corners .",
    "therefore , the only thing we need to check is that the petrie dual of the primal / dual separation graph does not have two faces sharing two edges .",
    "equivalently , we just need to show that boundary walks of a totally primal region and of a totally dual region never intersect more than once .",
    "but the boundary walks of totally primal regions run horizontally across our figure , and those of totally dual regions run vertically , and so they always meet exactly once .",
    "so we know that the partial dual @xmath58 constructed in this situation is closed @xmath0-cell .",
    "we can also provide the reader with another example , also for an embedding on the torus , where a partial dual is guaranteed _ not _ to be closed @xmath0-cell .",
    "it is not difficult to construct a toroidal graph embedding with primal and dual edges so that the primal / dual separation graph @xmath293 forms a @xmath0-face - colourable grid , i.e. , a standard toroidal embedding of the cartesian product @xmath388 for some @xmath389 , represented in the usual rectangular model of the torus by horizontal and vertical lines .",
    "the petrie walks in the primal / dual separation graph are then stair - stepping walks that go up and right , or down and right .",
    "the two petrie walks sharing an edge go in different directions . in the usual representation of the homotopy group of the torus as @xmath390",
    ", the up - and - right walks will have type @xmath391 , while the down - and - right walks will have type @xmath392 , for some @xmath393 .",
    "it is well known that two closed curves of homotopy types @xmath394 and @xmath395 in the torus must intersect at least @xmath396 times , so our walks must intersect at least @xmath397 times . if stair - stepping walks going in opposite directions intersect , they must do so along an edge .",
    "therefore , any two petrie walks going in different directions share at least two edges , and so the partial dual can not be closed @xmath0-cell .",
    "we conclude this section by discussing some graph embeddings that have no partial dual that is closed @xmath0-cell .",
    "our condition involves separability .",
    "we have mentioned that a graph with a closed @xmath0-cell embedding must be nonseparable . in other words",
    ", a separable graph does not have a closed @xmath0-cell embedding .",
    "however , a separable graph may have a partial dual that is closed @xmath0-cell .",
    "we can see this by working backwards .",
    "suppose we take a closed @xmath0-cell embedding @xmath7 , and let @xmath59 be the edges of a spanning tree in @xmath7 .",
    "then the region @xmath60 is just a fattened version of the tree formed by @xmath59 , and so has a single boundary component .",
    "therefore , by proposition [ bd - pd ] , @xmath398 has a single vertex , and every edge is a loop , so @xmath186 is separable ( in fact , every edge can be separated from all the other edges ) . but",
    "@xmath399 , which is closed @xmath0-cell .",
    "so we need a stronger condition than just separability to guarantee that a graph embedding @xmath7 has no partial dual that is closed @xmath0-cell .",
    "our reasoning uses gems , and we need the following standard result about proper @xmath179-edge - colourings of cubic graphs .",
    "suppose @xmath4 is an edge cut in a properly @xmath179-edge - coloured cubic graph .",

    "an edge cut of a single edge can not satisfy the parity lemma for all colours , so any edge cut must have at least two edges .",
    "moreover , if there is a @xmath0-edge cut , then the parity lemma implies that both edges are the same colour .",

    "the two yellow edges incident with @xmath407 and @xmath411 form a @xmath0-edge cut unless they are the same edge .",
    "but then @xmath412 , a contradiction . a similar argument applies to a blue @xmath0-edge cut .",

    "then @xmath414 are different colours by the parity lemma .",
    "suppose @xmath405 is red and @xmath408 is blue .",
    "the red - blue bigon containing @xmath405 must use @xmath408 , which means that @xmath405 and @xmath408 share a vertex @xmath415 .",
    "let @xmath416 be the yellow edge incident with @xmath415 .",
    "if @xmath417 , then @xmath418 is a @xmath0-edge cut , which is impossible , so @xmath419 and all edges of @xmath4 are incident with the same vertex .",
