    "electron - phonon coupling ( epc ) occupies a prominent role in various fields of condensed matter physics , including phonon - mediated superconductivity , photoemission band gap renormalization , current carriers inelastic scattering or the lifetime of hot electrons . concerning the calculation of epc matrix elements on the _ ab initio _ level ,",
    "up to now , mainly density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite and its perturbative linear response extensions ( dfpt ) @xcite have been applied , providing important information at the microscopic level .",
    "recently , several studies questioned the accuracy of the dft - based epc matrix elements when obtained with ( semi)local functionals such as lda or pbe . @xcite by way of example , the electron - phonon coupling involving specific electronic and phonon modes in graphene@xcite and graphite , @xcite the value of the electron - phonon coupling potential to states at the femi level in the electron - doped fullerene , @xcite superconducting bismuthates and transition - metal chloronitrides , @xcite or the renormalization of the photoemission band structure of pentacene @xcite and diamond crystals , @xcite were shown to be affected by a significant underestimation of the epc matrix elements when calculated within dft and ( semi)local functionals .",
    "as a cure to such problems , many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) techniques within the so - called @xmath0 approximation @xcite showed a clear improvement when compared to available experimental data .",
    "@xcite unfortunately , the kind of theories that are available within dft , and in particular the powerful dfpt formalism , @xcite are not yet available within the framework of mbpt .",
    "existing @xmath0 calculations of epc matrix elements have been therefore based on the frozen - phonon approach , necessitating a stepwise displacement of the atoms along the phonon modes with an explicit evaluation of the electronic structure on the @xmath0 level for each step .",
    "this demanding approach can not be reconciled with very large unit cells and is thus only feasible for zone - center or zone - boundary phonon modes .",
    "going beyond the frozen - phonon approach , in order to access epc matrix elements on the @xmath0 level for a large number of electron and phonon wave vectors , remains a considerable challenge to the _ ab initio _ community .",
    "significant work is still needed to come up with a scheme that may allow to generalize the pioneering above - mentioned studies to a much larger set of systems .    in the present study",
    ", we explore the merits of the static coulomb - hole plus screened exchange ( cohsex ) @xcite approximation to the @xmath0 self - energy for the calculation of the electron - phonon coupling matrix elements in the isolated fullerene molecule , in diamond and in graphene .",
    "our definitions of the relevant epc matrix elements follow previous studies related to the superconducting transition in the fullerides , @xcite the zero - point motion renormalization of the gap in diamond @xcite and the gap opening through electron - phonon coupling in graphene , @xcite respectively .",
    "for the same set of systems , we also explore the accuracy of the constant - screening approximation , namely the assumption that the screened coulomb potential can be considered , to linear order , as a constant upon small changes of the atomic positions .",
    "whereas cohsex leads to non - negligible discrepancies , this latter approximation will be shown to be robust and accurate .",
    "the present results offer important perspectives in making the @xmath0 formalism amenable to the study of condensed matter phenomena involving electron - phonon coupling .",
    "we briefly introduce the many - body perturbation theory green s function formalism , providing a solid framework for the calculation of quasiparticle energies @xmath3 . in such an approach ,",
    "the one - body quasiparticle eigenvalue equation reads :    @xmath4    where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the ionic and hartree potential , respectively .",
    "the self - energy @xmath7 replaces the well - known exchange - correlation potential of density functional theory or the exchange operator in the hartree - fock formalism . in general , it is non - local , energy - dependent and non - hermitian .",
    "derived within schwinger s functional derivative approach to perturbation theory , @xcite the @xmath0 approximation to the self - energy leads to :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 and @xmath1 are the time - ordered one - particle green s function and the dynamically screened coulomb potential , respectively , and @xmath10 a small positive infinitesimal .    the coulomb - hole plus screened - exchange ( cohsex ) representation of the @xmath0 self - energy was originally introduced using a time representation of @xmath9 , @xmath1 and @xmath11 .",
    "@xcite we follow hybertsen and louie @xcite by using the following spectral representations of @xmath9 and @xmath1 :    @xmath12    where @xmath9 has been written in terms of one - body eigenstates @xmath13 and eigenenergies @xmath14 , typically starting dft kohn - sham or hartree - fock solutions , and @xmath1 in terms of its spectral function @xmath15 .",
    "these expressions allow to obtain the pole structure of both @xmath9 and @xmath1 . from the residue theorem ,",
    "one then rapidly obtains an _ exact _ decomposition of @xmath11 :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 indicates the principal value .",
    "@xmath18 , which involves a summation over the occupied states only , originates from the poles of @xmath9 .",
    "it is called the screened exchange interaction in analogy to the bare exchange term that can be obtained by replacing @xmath1 with the energy - independent bare coulomb potential @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 originates from the poles of @xmath1 and represents the coulomb - hole contribution , since it can be shown to be related to the interaction of an electron with its related adiabatically built correlation hole .",
    "the static approximation to the exact cohsex decomposition assumes that @xmath21 for all ( n ) , leading to simplified static screened exchange and coulomb - hole expressions , namely :    @xmath22    here , @xmath23 is the difference between the screened and bare coulomb potential . as a result , besides being a static approximation , this coulomb - hole term is also local in space . such a static cohsex approximation ( labeled cohsex here below )",
    "was shown to yield too large gaps in the case of semiconductors .",
    "@xcite by way of example , in the present case of the c@xmath24 molecule , the cohsex gap is found to be 5.3 ev , i.e. 0.4 ev larger than the @xmath254.9 ev experimental gap.@xcite nevertheless , this has to be compared to the starting 1.6 ev dft - lda kohn - sham gap which is dramatically too small .    while it can not be claimed that the static cohsex approach is a good approximation to absolute quasiparticle energies , we emphasize that we are interested in quasiparticle energy differences upon small ( infinitesimal ) atomic lattice motions .",
    "the main assumption on which we rely to calculate the electron - phonon coupling within the cohsex approximation is that the _ variations _ of the dynamical contribution to the self - energy can be neglected .",
    "this can be _ a priori _ rationalized by emphasizing that dynamical interactions are driven by the plasmons dynamics , collective excitations less sensitive to small atomic displacements than single - particle excitation energies and wave functions .",
    "it remains , however , that besides the static approximation , the spatially local character of the static coh term is at odds with the nonlocality of the full @xmath0 self - energy .    in order to further justify the following results concerning the constant screening approach",
    ", namely the second approximation we explore in this study , it is instructive to consider the @xmath0 plus bethe - salpeter formalism . @xcite the latter is a many - body perturbation theory approach concerned with describing the linear response of a system with respect to a time - dependent external perturbation and thus the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) is the mbpt analogue to time - dependent dft . at the heart of the @xmath0/bse approach",
    "lies the variation @xmath26 , where the  perturbation \" @xmath27 is the one - body green s function @xmath9 .",
    "the most common approximation that has been shown to be remarkably accurate @xcite is to replace the @xmath0 self - energy by its static cohsex approximation , and to consider further that @xmath28 .",
    "it is such a simplified scheme we aim to explore in the present study , differing in the fact that the perturbation @xmath27 is now induced by a vibrational distortion of the system .",
    "the many - body @xmath0 and cohsex calculations for the isolated @xmath2 fullerene are performed using the code , an implementation of the @xmath0 formalism within a gaussian basis .",
    "@xcite we start from dft - lda eigenstates calculated with the package @xcite and a triple - zeta plus polarization ( tzp ) basis @xcite for the description of the valence orbitals combined with standard norm - conserving pseudopotentials .",
    "@xcite we use the resolution of the identity technique ( ri - svs ) with an even - tempered auxiliary basis set formed of four gaussians per angular channel ( up to _ d _ character ) with exponents between 0.2 and 3.2 bohr@xmath29 .",
    "with such a basis , our @xmath30@lda ionization potential and homo - lumo gap are found to be 7.33 ev and 4.39 ev ( b3lyp geometry ) , respectively , starting from a 1.66 ev dft - lda gap .",
    "this is in close agreement with the 7.45 ev and 4.40 ev plane wave @xmath30@lda values of ref .",
    "( lda geometry ) . the @xmath30@lda gap remains smaller than the @xmath254.9 ev experimental value , an issue that will be addressed by the partially self - consistent scheme used in the present study , as discussed below .",
    "following ref .  , we use the relaxed structure and phonon eigenmodes generated within a dft - b3lyp approach using a 6 - 311g(d ) basis .",
    "this was shown to provide vibrational frequencies in excellent agreement with raman measurements .",
    "@xcite concerning the calculation of the epc matrix elements , our present study follows the approach described in refs .  , where the electron - phonon coupling strength associated with the ( electron - doped ) lowest unoccupied 3-fold degenerate @xmath31 molecular orbital ( lumo ) has been explored within dft and @xmath0 .",
    "the specific choice of the lumo level is dictated by the physics of the phonon - mediated superconducting transition in the fullerides .",
    "@xcite we adopt the standard definition of the effective electron - phonon coupling potential @xmath32 that enters e.g. the mcmillan formula for the superconducting transition temperature through the dimensionless parameter @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the density of states at the fermi level .",
    "namely , @xmath32 reads in the so - called molecular limit : @xcite    @xmath35    here , @xmath36 is the mass of the carbon ions , @xmath37 is the frequency of the vibrational mode with index @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the vibrational polarization vector .",
    "as already discussed before , the electronic states with energy @xmath40 are limited to the 3-fold degenerate lumo level . from group theory analysis",
    "it follows that only the @xmath41 and @xmath42 vibrational modes can couple to these states . a schematic representation of the @xmath31 level splitting as a function of the deformation amplitude along a @xmath41 mode is provided in fig .",
    "[ fig : methods](a ) .",
    "the epc matrix elements are consequently related to the slopes ( @xmath43 ) , showing a strong dependence on the formalism adopted to calculate the energies @xmath44 .",
    "these energy derivatives are calculated within the frozen phonon approach , using a symmetric five points finite - difference formula .",
    "such an effective electron - phonon potential was calculated for @xmath2 in refs .",
    ", both within dft using diverse ( semi)local and hybrid exchange - correlation functionals and @xmath0 . while dft - lda values were shown to significantly underestimate the coupling energy , dft calculations performed with global hybrids containing 20@xmath45 - 30@xmath45 of exact exchange and the @xmath0 approach were found @xcite to compare favorably to gas phase experimental data .",
    "@xcite as a drawback of dft calculations with hybrids , it was evidenced that the resulting @xmath32 potential would quickly increase with the amount of exact exchange , yielding the usual question of the proper choice of the functional parameters for a given system .    in the present study , we are concerned with exploring simplified @xmath0 schemes , i.e approximations reducing the needed computational effort . as such , quasiparticle energies are evaluated at a single - shot cohsex and a partially self - consistent evcohsex level , where the quasiparticle energies are reinjected self - consistently in the construction of @xmath9 and @xmath1 , while keeping the starting kohn - sham lda wave functions unchanged .",
    "our reference point are partially self - consistent ev@xmath0 calculations with self - consistency on the eigenvalues as presented in ref .   for the calculation of the epc matrix elements in @xmath2 .",
    "such a simplified approach to full self - consistency , justified by the dramatically too small starting point dft - lda gap for small isolated molecules , has been shown in the case of gas phase organic systems to produce more accurate ionization potentials and electronic affinities , @xcite together with improved optical excitation energies at the @xmath0/bse level , @xcite when lda or pbe kohn - sham eigenstates are chosen as starting points .",

    "the discrepancy is of 3@xmath45 and 1.5@xmath45 applying the constant - screening approximation to @xmath0 and cohsex approaches , respectively .",
    "notice that the results for the constant - screening of the @xmath48-a@xmath49 phonon are affected by a numerical error of about 4@xmath45 , therefore the discrepancy could be slightly larger .",
    "anyway this difference is much smaller than the error induced by the standard dft - lda calculations , but also much smaller than the error induced by the static cohsex formalism as compared to the reference @xmath0 calculation .",
    "clearly , among the two approximations explored here above , the constant - screening stands as a much better approach than the static cohsex for the calculation of electron - phonon coupling matrix elements within the @xmath0 formalism .",
    "overall , the largest error induced by the static cohsex approximation is larger than 100@xmath45 in the diamond case , while it is reduced to 7@xmath45 in the case of the constant - screening approximation to full @xmath0 calculations .",
    "the static cohsex approximation is known to always overestimate band gaps . as proposed in ref .",
    ", a too large band gap should lead to an underscreening of the electron - phonon interaction and consequently to enhanced epc matrix elements .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that , within hartree - fock or with increasing exact exchange in hybrid functionals , the epc matrix elements are found to steeply increase .",
    "the hartree - fock @xmath104 and @xmath105 coupling constants in graphene were found to be about 5 and 30 times larger , respectively , as compared to their @xmath0 analog , @xcite while in @xmath2 increasing the percentage of exact exchange from 20@xmath45 to 30@xmath45 in hybrid functionals was found to enhance the @xmath32 energy by about 15@xmath45 .",
    "@xcite such an interpretation matches the observation that in graphene and @xmath2 , the cohsex epc coupling constants are larger than their corresponding @xmath0 reference . in the case of diamond , where we are concerned with the second - order derivatives , the effect of assuming",
    "a static approximation may be more difficult to interpret .",
    "an important observation further is that the coulomb - hole term is a local potential in the static cohsex approximation , washing out spatial local - field effects , a observation that may potentially allow to understand the failure of the cohsex approximation to reproduce accurately the evolution of the band structure with phonon deformation . in any case , the large variations of the induced errors from diamond to graphene and @xmath2 is still to be understood , and we will just stand here on the observation that the static cohsex approximation can not be trusted to improve on dft - lda calculations .    concerning the neglect of the gradient of @xmath1 with respect to the ionic positions , such an approximation was already tested by ismail - beigi and louie in the context of excited state ionic forces within the bethe - salpeter formalism , @xcite showing good agreement with explicit finite - difference `` exact '' bse calculations for small co and nh@xmath106 molecules .",
    "it is commonly assumed that the @xmath0/bse approach is much more resistant to approximations on @xmath1 as compared to the @xmath0 approach for ( charged ) excitations .",
    "this is due to cancellations of errors between the electron - electron and electron - hole interactions .",
    "namely , any error introduced in @xmath1 is expected to affect excitonic interactions and quasiparticle gaps in opposite ways .",
    "clearly , the present @xmath0 study of the variations of a given quasiparticle energy with respect to ionic positions can not benefit from such cancellation of errors .",
    "still , the constant - screening approximation turns to be a reliable approach to save on computational cost .",
    "an important consequence of the present findings is that once the screened coulomb potential @xmath107 is built for the equilibrium geometry , the calculation of the variations of the quasiparticle energies with respect to the perturbation ( @xmath27 ) only requires the evaluation of the variations of the green s function @xmath9 with respect to the perturbation .",
    "this can be performed within standard dfpt techniques , at least in the case of non - self - consistent @xmath30 calculations where the green s function assumes an explicit form in function of the input dft eigenstates .",
    "this may invite , for systems such as @xmath2 , to use @xmath30 calculations starting from dft eigenstates obtained with hybrid functionals , which have been shown to be a better starting point for finite - size systems .",
    "we have explored two approximations for calculating self - energy gradients of interest for electron - phonon coupling , namely the two simplifications commonly used in the @xmath0/bethe - salpeter calculations , that is the static cohsex and the constant screening approximations .",
    "we explored these approaches in the case of diamond , graphene and @xmath2 .",
    "our findings suggest that the cohsex approximation can not be trusted to improve on the dft - lda values as clearly illustrated in particular in the case of diamond . on the contrary ,",
    "the constant screening hypothesis , namely assuming that @xmath1 remains to first order constant with respect to small ionic displacements , seems to be reliable , with a discrepancy no larger than 10@xmath45 , even in the difficult case of graphene where the phonon perturbation dramatically affects the dirac cone and the ( semi)metallic nature of the graphene sheet . even though a deeper understanding of the origin of the specific difficulties uncountered by the static cohsex approximation would allow to better rationalize the validity and limits of the tested approximations , the present results offer promising perspectives to carry on such many - body evaluations of the electron - phonon coupling gradients with much reduced computer cost on realistic systems , including the study of periodic systems with arbitrary wave vector perturbation .",
    "further studies are however required on a larger set of systems and physical observables in order to better assess the interest , with respect to common dft calculations , of using the @xmath0 approach , and its various approximations , for calculating self - energy gradients with respect to ionic positions .",
