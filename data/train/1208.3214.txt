    "in his work about helium nuclei scattered by a heavy nucleus , rutherford had to consider how much close this beam of nuclei approach to the heavy target .",
    "obviously he was not able to see what happens at microscopic scales when the scattering of one single helium atom by the effect of a nucleus of the target occurs , so he got interested into macroscopic measurable quantities .",
    "one of this quantities is the differential cross section @xmath1 defined as the number of scattered particles per unit of time in a solid angle and divided by the incident intensity of the alpha particles beam @xcite @xcite .    in order to be able to compute @xmath1",
    ", he needed to find a relation between the impact parameter @xmath2 of a single alpha particle and the scattering angle @xmath3 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "@xmath1 depends on the impact parameter and the scattering angle as follows :    @xmath4    using the orbit equation of a particle under the effect of a central force , like the coulomb interaction , is possible to obtain @xmath5 . following this procedure the desired relation , after some algebra , turns out to be @xcite :    @xmath6    here @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the atomic numbers of the heavy nucleus and the incident alpha particle respectively , @xmath9 is the force constant of electrostatic coulomb interaction , @xmath10 is the energy of the alpha particle and @xmath11 is the electron charge .    .",
    "in 1968 the scientific comunity established the international system of units ( is ) . constituted by the so called base units , such that any other posible unit that might describe any physical process could be derived from these base units . in physics",
    "an unit system like the is is required for the dimensional analysis , which plays a fundamental role in many branches of physics .",
    "dimensional analysis is the one in charge to verify that the equations describing physical phenomena must be dimensionally homogeneous .",
    "as a simple example consider the bernoulli equation , which describes the energy conservation law for a inviscid fluid :    @xmath12    the subindex @xmath13 o @xmath14 indicates that the quantity is taken in two diferent points inside the fluid .",
    "@xmath15 is the local pressure , @xmath16 the velocity , @xmath17 is the fluid density and @xmath18 is the local height of the fluid .",
    "is easy to see using dimensional analysis that the dimensions of the above equation are given by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a dimension of mass , @xmath21 the dimension of length and @xmath22 the dimension of time .",
    "this holds for both sides of ( 3 ) satisfying the requirement of dimensional homogeneity ; the interesting feature of this kind of mathematical expressions is that they can be rewrittren in a dimensionless form by multiplying by a proper factor that cancel out any posible dimension in the equation .    through this process",
    ", some characteristic dimensionless numbers may appear , and they usually acquire some relevance depending on their physical significance .",
    "let us consider the navier stokes equations for an incompressible fluid affected by a gravitational field @xmath23 :    @xmath24    the characteristic dimensionless numbers of this general problem can be obtained easily by transforming ( 4 ) into its dimensionless form by considering the dimensionless variables @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , so that we get :    @xmath29    where the desired non - dimensional parameters are the reynolds and the froude numbers , @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively . but an alternative procedure to obtain dimensionless parameters without handling the equations of motion , which is more in the spirit of the buckingham @xmath0 theorem , is as follows .",
    "the general framework states that for a given physical problem with @xmath32 fundamental variables involved such that there exist a functional relationship of the form @xmath33 , there must exist @xmath34 dimensionless parameters called the @xmath0 numbers , which can be constructed from combinations of the @xmath35 characteristic variables of the problem @xcite , where @xmath36 is the rank of the corresponding dimensional matrix .",
    "tipically the number of fundamental dimensions or base units required to write the @xmath35 variables of the problem is the same as @xmath36 . from the set of",
    "the @xmath35 variables one must choose @xmath36 variables as the `` repeating variables '' which must appear in all the nondimensional @xmath0 numbers .",
    "it is important to remark that these repeating variables must have different dimensions between each other .",
    "now each @xmath37 dimensionless number @xmath38 is formed from the product of the @xmath36 repeating variables and one of the @xmath34 remaining fundamental variables , where each one of the repeating variables must have an unknown exponent :    @xmath39    here @xmath40 is the fundamental variable asociated to @xmath37 and it belongs to the set of the @xmath34 remaining variables .",
    "@xmath41 is the index over all the repeating variables .",
    "finally @xmath42 represents the corresponding exponent to be determined in such a way that all the parameters @xmath37 should be non dimensional . in this way is possible to rewrite @xmath33 as :    @xmath43",
    "the best way to illustrate the power of the buckingham @xmath0 theorem is by an example . in this paper",
    "we choose a particular situation where dimensional analysis have not been used before , that is the deduction of the functional relation @xmath5 for rutherford scattering .",
    "so we first choose the set of fundamental variables of the problem as @xmath44 . where @xmath45 the force between the heavy nucleus and the incident alpha particle for a typical distance . in this case",
    "@xmath46 and from the above set we choose @xmath47 to be the repeating variables .",
    "the theorem states that there are only two dimensionless parameters , the first is the scattering angle itself since this is already a non - dimensional quantity @xmath48 , and the second one can be founded from ( 6 ) using the three repeating variables choosen previously and @xmath49 :    @xmath50    which in terms of the three fundamental dimensions required in the problem turns out to be :    @xmath51    the requirement of @xmath52 to be dimensionless gives a simple linear system of equations for the unknown exponents @xmath53 .",
    "the solution is quite straightforward and gives @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 . now replacing these values of the exponents into ( 8) we get :    @xmath57    now notice that a tipical value for the electric force is given by :    @xmath58    and replacing this into the expression for @xmath52 gives :    @xmath59    finally using ( 7 ) is easy to see that :    @xmath60    then this can be used to obtain an expression for @xmath2 , as follows :    @xmath61    which is in perfect accordance with ( 2 ) .",
    "dimensional analysis and particulary the buckingham @xmath0 theorem is mainly used in fluid dynamics . however , in spite of this , in this paper we show a very simple and yet , powerfull use in a classical scattering problem , where it was shown that is posible to obtain a correct functional form of the impact parameter without using newton laws or any other conservation principle .",
