    "we developed aerogel production technique for the belle aerogel cherenkov counter in 1990s , and have studied for its upgrade program since 2002 @xcite . in our conventional production method @xcite , we are able to produce hydrophobic aerogels for a refractive index range of 1.005 - 1.07 by using alcohol solvent for the alcogel ( wet gel ) synthesis .",
    "introduction of new solvent , n , n - dimethylformamide ( dmf ) , extended the upper limit of refractive index up to 1.11 .",
    "furthermore , the range of refractive index was extended again by a new production method in a recent study @xcite .",
    "the production method also generates more transparent aerogels than conventional ones for a refractive index range of 1.06 - 1.26 .",
    "the aerogels with high refractive index and high transparency will expand future possibilities of particle identification .",
    "in addition , aerogel with a refractive index under 1.005 was also developed in recent years .",
    "it is a material with an extremely low density under 0.02 g/@xmath0 because refractive index ( @xmath1 ) of aerogel is expressed as a function of its density ( @xmath2 ) : @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a constant .",
    "it is expected that the low density aerogels will be utilized in cosmic dust sample return experiments , for example , the tanpopo @xcite , which is an astrobiology mission planned on the japanese experiment module ( jem ) in the international space station ( iss ) .    in this article , the development of extremely low density aerogels",
    "is described in the next section .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the introduction of the new production method for high refractive index aerogels . in section 4 , the transparency of new aerogels is explained .",
    "then , conclusion is given after a description of a result of a beam test in section 5 .",
    "the lower limit of refractive index was 1.005 in our conventional production method so far . in a recent study for the development of a cosmic dust capture medium , we have succeeded in developing aerogel with a refractive index of 1.0026 ( 0.01 g/@xmath0 in density ) . that was achieved by optimizing the mixing ratio of raw chemical solutions .",

    "aerogels enable intact capture of cosmic dust particles even at hypervelocity impact of a few kilometers per second .",
    "we think that lower density aerogels cause less thermal damage to incident particles .",
    "it is very important in order to carry out mineralogical and biochemical analyses after returning to the ground .",
    "the aerogels with a density of 0.01 g/@xmath0 is transparent enough to find captured micron - size particles .",
    "a hypervelocity impact experiment was performed by using a two - stage light - gas gun at the institute of space and astronautical science , japan aerospace exploration agency ( isas / jaxa ) in 2007 .",
    "simulated cosmic dust particles with a diameter of 50 @xmath6 m were successfully captured by our new 0.01 g/@xmath0 aerogel blocks at a velocity of 4 km / s .",
    "on the other hand , this low refractive index aerogels were tested as a cherenkov radiator by using positron beams at the laboratory of nuclear science ( lns ) of tohoku university in 2008 @xcite .",
    "although the number of detected photons ( @xmath7 ) was low , it was confirmed that cherenkov light was emitted from the aerogels with @xmath1 = 1.0026 .",

    "to evaluate pinhole - dried aerogels as a cherenkov radiator , newly produced aerogels were irradiated with 2 gev / c electron beams at the kek fuji test beam line in 2008 . a prototype aerogel rich counter with a @xmath11 array of 144 channel multi - anode hybrid avalanche photon detectors ( hapd ) was built and electron beams were tracked by two mwpcs arranged up and down stream of the rich counter",

    "that the thickness of aerogel radiators is 1 cm , the @xmath7 of the aerogel with @xmath1 = 1.198 was 9.8 while that of an reference aerogel with @xmath1 = 1.066 was 3.9 .     accumulated hit distribution of cherenkov photons at the photon - detection plane .",
