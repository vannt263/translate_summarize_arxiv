    "liquid silica is the archetypal `` strong liquid , '' that is , a liquid whose viscosity @xmath2 and other measures of relaxation follow closely an arrhenius behavior , @xmath3  @xcite , where @xmath0 is the temperature . for most liquids ,",
    "@xmath2 increases significantly faster than an arrhenius law as @xmath0 approaches the glass transition temperature @xmath4 ; these liquids are referred to as `` fragile . ''",
    "strong liquids such as silica are important as glass - forming systems . in a strong liquid , @xmath2 varies less rapidly with @xmath0 near @xmath4 , compared to a fragile liquid . as a consequence , a strong liquid",
    "can be held in a desired range of @xmath2 over a wider range of @xmath0 than a fragile liquid .",
    "as every glassblower knows , this makes silica - based systems easier to manipulate just above @xmath4 than any other commonly available liquid .",
    "the fundamental origins of strong behavior in glass - forming liquids is also a subject of continuing interest .",
    "we note in particular two recent developments .",
    "first , computer simulation work of horbach and kob  @xcite using the `` bks '' model of silica  @xcite has demonstrated that at high @xmath0 , the model liquid exhibits fragile behavior , and then crosses over to a regime of strong behavior upon cooling .",
    "the work of la nave and coworkers , based on instantaneous normal mode analysis , has shown that such a crossover is connected to a progressive reduction in the number of diffusive directions in phase space accessed by the system  @xcite .",
    "such a `` fragile - to - strong crossover '' ( fsc ) may be a general mechanism underlying the emergence of strong behavior , and has since been studied for a number of systems  @xcite .",
    "we note that a crossover from a super - arrhenius to arrhenius dynamics may be a general feature of liquids around the so - called mode - coupling temperature  @xcite , as is appearing to emerge in recent numerical studies , thanks to the the larger dynamical window made available by current computational power  @xcite . however , the @xmath0 region where equilibrium simulations can be performed is still limited , and does not allow for a precise statement of the @xmath0-dependence below the crossover temperature , as required to make final contact with models for the glass transition  @xcite .",
    "second , a growing body of computer simulation research has established the importance of the potential energy landscape or surface ( pes ) for understanding the dynamics of liquids near @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the pes refers specifically to @xmath5 , the instantaneous potential energy hypersurface of the system , expressed as a function of the @xmath6 coordinates @xmath7 that specify the positions of the @xmath8 atoms of the system ; i.e. @xmath9 .",
    "the properties and topology of the pes have been carefully studied in the above cited works , predominantly in the case of fragile liquids , resulting in important insights into the equilibrium  @xcite and out - of - equilibrium  @xcite thermodynamics of supercooled states , and the connection between thermodynamics and transport propertie  @xcite .",
    "however , the relationship of the pes to the dynamic properties of strong liquids is less well understood . in this paper , our focus is to clarify this relationship , and in particular , to determine if the fsc proposed for liquid silica can be connected to properties of the pes .",
    "following previous studies of fragile liquids , our approach is to apply the `` inherent structure '' formalism of stillinger and weber  @xcite to molecular dynamics ( md ) computer simulation data obtained for the bks model of liquid silica . in this approach",
    ", the pes is partitioned into basins associated with the local minima of @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "each minimum corresponds to a particular configuration of atoms and is called an inherent structure ( is ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath11 the average potential energy of the is s associated with the basins sampled by the equilibrium liquid at a given @xmath0 and volume @xmath12 .",
    "an is and its energy can be obtained in computer simulation by carrying out a local minimization of @xmath5 starting from an equilibrium liquid configuration .",
    "as we will describe in detail below , the evaluation of @xmath11 , combined with free energy calculations , allows us to calculate the configurational entropy , @xmath1 , of the system  @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 determines the number of distinct configurations explored by the system , in this case the basins of the pes . in a liquid",
    ", diffusion is associated with the exploration by the system of different basins of the pes .",
    "the work of adam and gibbs ( ag ) predicts a relationship ( in the low @xmath0 limit ) between the characteristic relaxation time of the system and @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the ag relation has been recently derived in a novel way  @xcite . generalizing the ag relation to the diffusion coefficient @xmath13",
    ", the ag relation can be written as , @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are presumed to be constant with respect to @xmath0 . in the context of liquid silica ,",
    "an interesting test of the robustness of the ag relation is possible by checking if eq .",
    "[ eag ] is obeyed throughout the region in which the fsc occurs .",
    "if so , the ag relation then provides a basis for connecting transport behavior ( quantified by @xmath13 ) to the properties of the pes ( quantified by @xmath1 and @xmath11 ) .    in a recent letter  @xcite",
    ", we showed that liquid bks silica behaves in a manner that allows @xmath1 to be calculated from @xmath11 , and that @xmath13 and @xmath1 are related as predicted by the ag relation .",
    "we were thereby able to show that the fsc in liquid silica is associated with a change in the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath11 , i.e. a change in the nature of the pes explored by the system as @xmath0 decreases .",
    "we also found that this observation in turn has implications for other behavior observed in bks silica , in particular , the possible occurrence of a liquid - liquid transition , and the behavior of the liquid as related to the so - called kauzmann paradox .",
    "to reach such conclusions , extensive md simulations are required over a wide range of @xmath12 and @xmath0 , to calculate thermodynamic and transport properties , as well as careful examination of the is properties .",
    "in addition , the absolute free energy of the liquid must be evaluated . in the present work ,",
    "we provide a detailed description of the methods used to obtain the results summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite , and also provide an expanded analysis and discussion of the results .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe our md simulations , including the interaction potential used .",
    "section  iii provides a detailed description of the techniques we use to evaluate @xmath11 , @xmath1 , and the total free energy of the liquid .",
    "section  iv presents the results of these calculations and provides a discussion of their implications .",
    "we carry out md simulations at constant @xmath12 .",
    "most of our results are for a system of 444 si atoms and 888 o atoms .",
    "a few simulations are carried out with a reduced number of particles ( 333 si and 666 o atoms ) in order to access longer physical times scales .",
    "our md simulation program is based on the `` mdcspc2 '' source code  @xcite .",
    "we also reproduce a subset of our results using a code we have written independently of mdcspc2 .",
    "note that all molar quantities are reported here in moles of atoms .",
    "our model of atomic interactions in silica , denoted here as @xmath17 , is based on the bks potential , modified in two ways .",
    "first , the bks potential energy for both the si - o and o - o interactions diverges unphysically to negative infinity at sufficiently small distances , allowing `` fusion '' events to occur during simulation of high @xmath0 systems . to prevent this",
    ", @xmath17 consists of the standard bks potential plus a short range term given by @xmath18\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the interatomic separation between an atom @xmath20 of species @xmath21 , and an atom @xmath22 of species @xmath23 .",
    "to choose the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( see table  [ tpar ] ) we first identify the value @xmath26 at which the inflection of the standard bks potential occurs , below which the divergence to negative infinity develops .",
    "the parameters are chosen so that the new potential increases monotonically , and without inflections , as @xmath19 decreases for @xmath27 ; and so that the difference between the new and the old potentials is small for @xmath28 .",
    "similar approaches have been used in other works  @xcite .",
    "the second modification to the standard bks potential included in @xmath17 relates to the treatment of longer range interactions . as is common in implementations of the bks potential ,",
    "we calculate the long range contributions to the coulombic potential energy using the ewald summation technique , with the dipole surface term set to zero  @xcite .",
    "the reciprocal space summation is carried out to a radius of six reciprocal lattice cell widths . in this approach , the real space contributions to the bks potential are usually cut off discontinuously at a specified distance , often chosen as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the length of an edge of the simulation cell .",
    "however , we study systems over a wide range of density @xmath31 , and we desire a potential for which the cut - off is independent of @xmath30 .",
    "also , for accurate determination of inherent structures , we wish to remove discontinuities in the potential energy arising from cut - offs , and to remove any @xmath30 dependence from long range corrections associated with the cut - off .    to achieve these goals , instead of discontinuously cutting off the real space potential contributions",
    ", we introduce a switching function . at a fixed distance @xmath32  nm the real space terms of the standard bks potential are replaced by a 5th degree polynomial that tapers smoothly to zero over the range @xmath33 , where @xmath34  nm . the polynomial coefficients and the value of @xmath35 are chosen so that the potential is continuous up to and including second derivatives at both @xmath36 and @xmath37 ; and so that the potential and its first two derivatives are monotonic for @xmath33 , and go to zero as @xmath38 .",
    "these choices depend on the ewald parameter @xmath39 that occurs in both the real and reciprocal space contributions to the potential energy . for all @xmath30 ,",
    "we choose @xmath40 to ensure sufficient convergence of the potential energy in the reciprocal space summation for the densities studied .",
    "the value @xmath34  nm where the switching function reaches zero is chosen to include third si - si neighbor interactions at most densities studied .    the real space contribution to @xmath17 , denoted here as @xmath41 , is therefore a piece - wise defined function of the form , @xmath42\\\\                   \\phi ( r_s < r_{ij}<r_c ) & = & d_{\\mu\\nu}(r_{ij } - r_s)^5                   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & e_{\\mu\\nu}(r_{ij } -r_s)^4 \\nonumber \\\\                   & + & f_{\\mu\\nu}(r_{ij } -r_s)^3 \\\\ \\phi ( r_{ij}\\ge r_c )                   & = & 0 \\label{switch}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the complementary error function and @xmath44 is the permittivity constant .",
    "the parameters are given in table  [ tpar ] .",
    "note that the above modifications have the consequence that the average potential energy @xmath45 and pressure @xmath46 obtained using @xmath17 differ from those obtained using the standard bks potential .",
    "we find that the differences are approximately independent of @xmath0 along isochores . at @xmath47",
    "k and @xmath48  g/@xmath49 , we find that @xmath17 gives a @xmath46 value @xmath50  gpa greater than the standard bks potential , and @xmath45 is @xmath51  kj / mol higher . at the same @xmath0 and @xmath52  g/@xmath49 ,",
    "the respective differences are @xmath53  gpa and @xmath54  kj / mol higher .",
    "these are not large differences on the scale of our measurements , and the qualitative behavior of the system is , as shown below , consistent with that found in other studies based on the bks model . for the free energy calculation to be described below ,",
    "we also perform md simulations using a binary lennard - jones ( lj ) potential , in which two atomic species ( also labeled `` si '' and `` o '' ) occur in the same @xmath55 proportion as in sio@xmath56 .",
    "the lj pair potential is of the form @xmath57 -             \\phi^{\\rm shift}_{\\mu\\nu } \\label{lj}\\ ] ] the pair potential is cut off at @xmath58 and @xmath59 is determined so that @xmath60 .",
    "these potential parameters are given in table  [ tpar ] .    in order to obtain equilibrium properties we use the following procedure .",
    "we equilibrate the liquid using velocity rescaling for a time @xmath61 long enough to allow si atoms to diffuse an average of @xmath62  nm , after significant relaxation of @xmath46 and @xmath45 have disappeared from the system history .",
    "the interval of velocity rescaling varies from @xmath63 to @xmath64 time steps depending on @xmath0 .",
    "the time step for all runs is @xmath65  fs , except for @xmath66  k , where the time step is @xmath67  fs . velocity scaling is then turned off and the system is evolved in a constant @xmath68 ensemble for at least @xmath69 .",
    "( @xmath70 is the total energy . ) using this approach , there is no appreciable drift in @xmath70 during the constant @xmath68 phase , over which we calculate equilibrium quantities .    for the lowest @xmath0 where relaxation is slowest we modify this procedure to improve our sampling of phase space",
    ": we conduct up to five independent runs , with the constant @xmath68 phase of each run lasting at least @xmath71 .",
    "the reported properties ( including @xmath0 ) are averages over both time and over the independent runs .",

    "an extrapolation of the observed high @xmath0 behavior raises the possibility that @xmath1 might reach zero at finite @xmath0 .",

    "it is therefore tempting to speculate that our observations may be transferable to other systems to which the kauzmann paradox seems to apply .",
    "how @xmath209 is maintained in deeply supercooled liquids can perhaps be understood in terms of the pes changes observed here .",
    "moreover , the pes change we find in bks silica is correlated to the fragile - to - strong dynamical crossover .",
    "hence it is possible that the fsc and ( the avoidance of ) the kauzmann paradox are fundamentally interrelated phenomena .",
    "however , if the above speculations are confirmed , it is important to note the differences between silica and other supercooled liquids .",
    "the picture developed above implies that the @xmath0 range of the phenomenon by which silica avoids the kauzmann paradox is above , and widely separated from , @xmath4 in silica . in other supercooled liquids ,",
    "the glass transition may occur at @xmath0 above , and thus obscure , the pes changes found here .",
    "more work on these possibilities is clearly required .    to      in order to draw the conclusions given above , we must also test that the liquid satisfies the ag relation .",
    "if @xmath1 does not control the behavior of @xmath13 , then we will lack the basis required for making a connection between the behavior of the pes and the liquid dynamics .",

    "the ag relation is obeyed by data that follows a straight line on such a plot .",
    "we find that the isochores of @xmath204 provide the best agreement with the ag relation .",
    "note also that both high and low @xmath31 isochores , regardless of whether @xmath1 exhibits an inflection , obey the ag relation .",
    "thus we see that regardless of dynamical regime ( fragile or strong ) , and regardless of inflections in the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath1 or @xmath11 , the liquid behaves so as to satisfy the ag relation .",
    "this observation reinforces the positive tests of the ag prediction that have been documented in other work ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in fig .",
    "[ params - ag ] we present estimates of the constants @xmath16 and @xmath15 that appear in eq .",

    "[ scdcomp ] . at lower @xmath0 ,",
    "isotherms of @xmath1 and @xmath13 pass through a maximum at approximately the same @xmath12 .",

    "the trend is for isochores of @xmath13 , @xmath1 and @xmath198 to become monotonic functions of @xmath12 .",
    "an observation that the @xmath12 dependence of entropy follows that of @xmath13 would be consistent with recent work examining the relationship between structural disorder and diffusivity in bks silica  @xcite .    to      in terms of the various contributions to @xmath213 ,",

    "at all @xmath31 , @xmath217 exhibits a maximum ; at the lowest @xmath31 the inflection in the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath11 means that @xmath218 also passes through a maximum .",
    "together , at low @xmath31 , the strength of these two contributions becomes large enough to give a peak in the total value of @xmath214 .",
    "this peak is therefore a thermal signature approximately demarcating the crossover from fragile to strong dynamical behavior .",
    "it would be interesting to explore if such signatures could be observed in high @xmath0 experiments on silica , or related systems  @xcite .    to      real amorphous solid silica displays `` polyamorphism , '' the conversion under pressure of a low density form to a high density form , that occurs in some ways as though it were a first - order phase transition .",
    "computer simulations of bks silica have provided evidence that this polyamorphic transition may correspond to a sub-@xmath4 remnant of a liquid - liquid phase transition occurring in the equilibrium liquid  @xcite .",
    "having found that the same model , bks silica , exhibits a thermodynamic anomaly , in the form of a @xmath214 peak associated with a fsc , it is natural to ask if this phenomenon is related in some way to polyamorphism .",
    "it is difficult at present to answer this question decisively , since the region of the proposed liquid - liquid instability in bks silica has only been approximately located , and seems to lie in a @xmath0 range below that at which we can evaluate equilibrium liquid properties with current computational resources .",
    "however , several trends suggest a connection .",
    "first , we find that the @xmath0 at which the peak of @xmath214 occurs decreases with increasing @xmath31 , and passes outside of our range of observation at the approximate @xmath31 where liquid - liquid phase separation is proposed ( fig .  [ cv_peaks ] ) . this behavior is consistent with the observed @xmath214 peaks being a line ( in the @xmath12-@xmath0 plane ) of high-@xmath0",
    ", non - singular thermodynamic anomalies that becomes singular as the critical region of the liquid - liquid transition is approached .",
    "second , the observed line of @xmath214 peaks naturally defines a `` crossover zone '' in the behavior of the liquid between a high-@xmath0 , high-@xmath31 region ( region i in fig .",
    "[ cv_peaks ] ) , within which the liquid is more fragile , the is energies are relatively high , the tetrahedral network is disrupted , and the properties are in general more similar to simpler liquids ; and a low-@xmath0 , low-@xmath31 region ( region ii in fig .",
    "[ cv_peaks ] ) within which the liquid is becoming strong , the is energies are dropping ( perhaps toward a lower limit ) , the tetrahedral network is becoming prominent , and complex thermodynamic behavior ( e.g. negative expansivity ) emerges .",
    "it is possible that these two regions of behavior , as @xmath0 decreases , become progressively more sharply separated , perhaps ultimately by a first - order phase transition .    to    more research , both through experiments and simulations ,",
    "is required to confirm or refute such a picture .",
    "however , our current understanding of the bks system suggests that three distinct phenomena may in fact be interrelated : ( i ) the fsc , ( ii ) polyamorphism , and ( iii ) the landscape behavior that allows the kauzmann paradox to be avoided . in this",
    "regard , sasai has recently studied the interrelationship of the fsc and a liquid - liquid phase transition in a random energy model  @xcite .",
    "also , it is worth considering the behavior of other systems ( e.g. bef@xmath56  @xcite ) that display one or more of the above three phenomena , to test if the others also appear . in particular , for any system that becomes strong at low @xmath0 via a fsc , it may be that polyamorphism can be observed under nearby thermodynamic conditions .",
