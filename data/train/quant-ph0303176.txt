    "the magnitude of the splitting is proportional to cube of electron wave number @xmath116 . in mosfet s and hetero - structures ,",
    "the host crystals are not treated as 3d systems , because crystal symmetry is broken at the interface where the 2deg is dynamically confined in a quantum well .",
    "the reduction of effective dimensionality lowers symmetry of underlying crystals and results in an additional ( linear in @xmath116 ) term in the dresselhaus splitting .",
    "it is seen that the linear in @xmath116 term is dominant in gaas quantum wells . _",
    "( ii ) macroscopic forces ( rashba effect)- _ in addition to the above microscopic forces there is another source of splitting , an interface electric field@xcite .",
    "it is manifest in a linear in @xmath116 splitting of 2d band structure . in most 2deg systems ,",

    "6(a ) for the special case of very weak pumping ( from eq .  9 ) and in fig .",
    "6(b ) for the general case ( from eq .  4 ) .",

    "increasing @xmath119 leads to a small charge current , which for @xmath121 becomes significant , and of same order of magnitude as the spin current .",
    "interestingly the spin - current oscillates as a function of @xmath122 , indicating the importance of interference effects . in the inset of fig s .",

    "it would also be worthwhile to point out that in - spite of the fact that a small charge current contribution manifests itself in the strong pumping regime , the magnitude of the pumped spin currents increases manifold both in case of dresselhaus spin - orbit interaction and more so in case of rashba spin - orbit interaction .",

    "another method of experimentally realizing this proposal could be to put two such stripes side by side and applying different external magnetic fields to both , modulation of these external fields can effectively provide spin - polarized currents .",
    "to conclude , a spin polarized device acting on the principles of quantum adiabatic transport has been proposed . in the dc- transport case",
    "this device does not show any sign of spin - polarization as the system is time reversal invariant but in the adiabatic regime , when time reversal invariance is dynamically broken almost cent percent spin polarization is observed , incidentally in all the simulations , apart from the effects of inelastic scattering or to a lesser extent if significant spin - orbit scattering is present , we obtain zero charge current . as a welcome addition we see almost noiseless transport i.e. , realization of an optimal quantum spin pump .",
    "these features tell us that a adiabatically modulated magnetic barrier may be the best way to achieve not only quantum spin pumping but also optimal quantum spin pumping .",
