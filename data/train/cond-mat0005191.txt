    "for a long time , the prediction of the equation of state of polymers from first principles was such a difficult task that it could not be solved without the need of very idealized models with more or less meaningful empirical parameters .",
    "perhaps the most successful of the early attempts was that of prigogine _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite who considered a lattice and introduced an ad - hoc empirical parameter known as the `` number of degrees of freedom per monomer '' . later on , flory _",
    "_ @xcite extended this theory to the continuum at the cost of introducing some additional parameters , leading to what is now known as the fove theory .",
    "another approach to the problem is based on the polymer+solvent and polymer+vacuum analogy . in this way , the well known flory - huggins @xcite ( fh ) and",
    "sanchez - lacombe @xcite equations of state have also been employed to describe the behavior of pure fluids .    on the other hand ,",
    "the approach from liquid state theory has taken much longer to yield useful results but has now reached a point where a rather satisfactory description of the equation of state of idealized polymer models in the continuum is affordable without the need of any empirical parameters whatsoever .",
    "the most popular approaches are the polymer reference interaction site model ( prism ) of curro and schweizer , @xcite the generalized dimer flory theory ( gdf ) of honnell and hall @xcite and the thermodynamic perturbation theory of wertheim ( tpt1 ) .",
    "@xcite the latter has been widely used not only because it yields results that are of similar or superior quality than other alternatives , but because it is the simplest and more tractable of all them and demands a minimum of information .",
    "originally , this theory was developed to consider fluids of associating hard spheres .",
    "@xcite later on , it was realized that in the limit of infinite associating strength , a polydisperse mixture of polymers was recovered .",
    "@xcite chapman _",
    "_ extended the theory to monodisperse polymer fluids and rewrote the equations in a very convenient notation .",
    "@xcite later , by adding a mean field perturbative contribution , jackson _ et al .",
    "_ showed that the theory was able to describe the behavior of very different sorts of real fluids .",
    "@xcite meanwhile , it was realized that the theory could be used just as well to consider polymers made of attractive monomers.@xcite in this way , it is possible to describe real fluids with improved accuracy and no need for a mean field  like perturbation .",
    "since then , the theory has achieved enormous popularity and has been applied to describe polymers of tangent lennard - jones beads @xcite and square wells , @xcite as well as to describe real fluids in chemical engineering applications .",
    "@xcite furthermore , modifications of the original theory have been proposed that allow to describe realistic polymer models without the need of empirical parameters .",
    "@xcite    a very interesting issue both from the practical and theoretical point of view is the behavior of the critical point of polymer fluids as the number of monomers increases . by invoking the polymer+solvent and polymer+vacuum analogy",
    ", one would expect from the fh theory that the pure polymer fluid should reach an asymptotic critical temperature , whereas the critical mass density should become vanishingly small .",
    "however , in a recent paper , chatterjee and schweizer @xcite have pointed out that this analogy can not be taken for granted because the fh scaling predictions are determined by imposing equal chemical potentials , whereas the critical point of pure polymer fluids is related to a phase equilibria that results from the condition of equal pressure at a given temperature .",
    "@xcite    on the other hand , based on rather limited amount of data , several empirical correlations have been employed to predict the critical properties of substances such as polymethylene .",
    "@xcite these correlations have predicted widely different behavior , ranging from infinite critical temperature @xcite to finite asymptotic critical mass density .",
    "@xcite more soundly based equations such as the fove have been recently employed to support the idea that the critical mass density could reach an asymptotic constant value .",
    "@xcite however , such an approach relies on extending the applicability of the fove theory to densities below which it was not meant to be used .",
    "@xcite renormalization group calculations , however , show that the fh mean field theory yields the correct asymptotic dependence in the long chain length limit@xcite , albeit this asymptotic behavior is only reached for extremely long chains and the corrections to scaling are enormous even for typical chain length considered experimentally.@xcite    more recently , new experimental techniques have allowed to measure the critical points of longer n - alkanes whose critical temperature lays above the point where thermal decomposition starts .",
    "@xcite these experiments show that the critical mass density reaches a maximum and then starts to decrease .",
    "@xcite simulation results of both realistic alkanes @xcite and idealized polymer models @xcite give support to this finding .    surprisingly , very little attention has been devoted to the study of this problem from the point of view of the modern theories such as prism , gfd or tpt1 . in a recent paper ,",
    "the prism was employed in an attempt to solve the question in the framework of an analytical tractable theory , leading to different predictions depending on the closure employed to solve the prism equation .",
    "@xcite other previous studies using tpt1 plus a mean field attractive contribution suggested that the critical mass density should vanish in the infinite chain length limit .",
    "@xcite however , such a conclusion relied on the assumption that the mean field contribution increases linearly with the chain length , a point which at present can not be taken for granted .",
    "_ @xcite have recently presented a theory that may be considered as the simplest possible approximation to wertheim s theory and arrive to the same conclusion as reference @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will try to reach further understanding of this issue . in the next section",
    ", we will review the fundamentals of wertheim s theory by using somewhat different but more physically appealing arguments suggested by zhou and stell .",
    "@xcite we will then show by means of general arguments how the scaling laws for the critical properties are closely related to the virial coefficients ( section iii ) .",
    "we will then apply tpt1 to a polymer model and briefly describe how to implement the theory in section iv and in the appendixes .",
    "section v describes the details of the simulations performed to test the theory .",
    "we then devote section vi to present our results and close with a brief conclusion .",
    "we consider a monodisperse fluid of polymers made up of @xmath1 monomers each .",
    "non bonded monomers of the same polymer and monomers belonging to different molecules interact through some pair potential , @xmath3 , while adjacent monomers of the same molecule have an additional bonding potential , @xmath4 , responsible for the connectivity of the polymer .",
    "this potential is such that its action vanishes beyond some well defined inter - atomic distance .",
    "if eventually , two adjacent monomers were found outside this range , they would no longer be bonded and the n - mer would be considered to have broken . in practice , this can be avoided by making the well depth of the associating potential infinitely large .    alternatively , we may consider an associating multicomponent mixture of @xmath1 different monomeric species , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , etc .",
    "each of these species interacts with members of its own species and with members of the remaining species by means of @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , the bonding potential @xmath4 is responsible for associating reactions between monomers of type @xmath5 with monomers of type @xmath6 , monomers of type @xmath6 with monomers of type @xmath7 and so on .",
    "more concisely , the association reaction taking place is of the form : @xmath8 as the bonding potential is pairwise , the only requirement that is needed to define the @xmath9 complex as an n - mer is that each of the adjacent pairs be found within the range of the bonding potential . clearly , for an equimolar composition of such a mixture in the limit of complete association , we are lead to a system identical to that described in the preceding paragraph .",
    "from a physical point of view , this limit is reached for infinite well depths . however , in what follows it will prove useful to consider that the well depth has some arbitrary finite value .",
    "the system is then made of a mixture of free monomers and n - mers whose composition depends on the nature of the bonding potential .    considering the similarity between the two systems described",
    ", we may get an approximation for the equation of state for the chain molecule by studying the behavior of the associating system . in order to do so",
    ", we will obtain an expression for the free energy in terms of the degree of association of the mixture .",
    "we will then relate the degree of association to the structure of the system and introduce some simplifying assumptions for the n - body correlations .",
    "finally , we will take the limit of complete association and get an equation of state for the chain fluid .",
    "let us consider an associating system as that described before , which is initially prepared by mixing in equal proportions the pure monomers , so that there are @xmath10 monomers of each species inside a volume @xmath11 and the resulting number density of each of the species is @xmath12 .",
    "the system will eventually reach a state of equilibrium , whereby a fraction of the monomers of each species has associated to form n - mers .",
    "let this fraction be @xmath13 .",
    "then , the remaining concentration of non bonded monomers of each species is given by @xmath14 , while , according to the stoichiometry of the reaction , the concentration of n - mers will be @xmath15 ( note that in the limit of complete association @xmath12 will actually designate the polymer number density ) .",
    "schematically , the process can be described as follows : @xmath16    obviously , the number of n - mers formed is @xmath17 , while the number of remaining free monomers of each species is @xmath18 .",
    "the total helmholtz free energy of the system , @xmath19 is therefore given by : @xmath20    in what follows , we associate a number from @xmath21 to @xmath1 to each of the n species .",
    "therefore , @xmath22 stands for the chemical potential of species @xmath23 in the mixture of composition given by @xmath13 .",
    "it is important to realize that the composition of the mixture as given by the association degree is appropriate to a given model potential . in the above expression for the free energy ,",
    "we have considered a system of monomers that interact through some reference potential , @xmath3 , while a bonding potential is responsible for the connectivity of the n - mer .",
    "let us now consider a reference fluid made of monomers that interact through the reference potential but that have no association potential whatsoever . in this case , the free energy is best expressed in terms of the chemical potential of the monomers alone .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we will denote this free energy as @xmath24 , albeit from a strictly geometrical point of view , n - mers could form eventually even in the absence of a bonding potential : @xmath25    the free energy of the associating system measured relative to that of the reference fluid is then given by : @xmath26                     + \\alpha[\\mu_{\\rm n - mer}(\\alpha ) - \\sum_{i=1}^n                                       \\mu_i(\\alpha ) ]             - [ p(\\alpha ) - p(\\alpha=0)]\\frac{v}{n}\\ ] ] this equation can be further simplified by invoking the condition of chemical equilibrium of the associating mixture , which reads : @xmath27 substitution of the above equation into eq . [ eqdeltaa_1 ] yields : @xmath28                     - [ p(\\alpha ) - p(\\alpha=0)]\\frac{v}{n}\\ ] ]    let us now express the chemical potentials of each of the components in terms of an ideal and an excess contribution : @xmath29 introducing the above expression for the chemical potential into eq .",
    "[ eqdeltaa_2 ] , we get : @xmath30                     - [ p(\\alpha ) - p(\\alpha=0)]\\frac{v}{n}\\ ] ]    if we now recall that @xmath31 and @xmath32 , we finally obtain : @xmath33                     - [ p(\\alpha ) - p(\\alpha=0)]\\frac{v}{n}\\ ] ] this is an exact equation for the difference in free energy between the associating system ( with @xmath34 n - mers ) and the reference non - associating fluid of free monomers .",
    "as it stands , it may seem rather useless , because it is a function of the unknown quantities : @xmath13 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "however , we shall see that in the low density limit , the above equation becomes a function of the degree of association only and that this , in turn , may be obtained from knowledge of n - body correlations in the fluid . in a further approximation",
    ", the n - body correlations of the fluid will be expressed in terms of n - body correlations of a reference fluid of non  bonded monomers . finally , by invoking a superposition approximation",
    ", we will express the n - body correlations in terms of two body correlations and obtain an expression for the pressure that depends solely on known quantities of a reference fluid of spherical particles .      in the limit of low density",
    ", the equation of state of the associating system will depend only on the total number of particles in the fluid , @xmath37 : @xmath38 @xmath37 is simply obtained by summing the number of particles of each species : @xmath39    on the other hand , the number of particles of the completely un - associated system is simply @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , the difference in pressure between the non  bonded system and the system with degree of association @xmath13 is : @xmath41 by using this expression and considering that , by definition , the excess chemical potentials vanish in the limit of low density , eq .",
    "[ eqdeltaa_4 ] becomes : @xmath42 this is an exact equation for the difference in free energy in the limit of low density .",
    "applying the standard thermodynamic relationship connecting the pressure with the free energy yields the exact expression for the difference in pressure in the limit of low density : @xmath43    in what follows , we will consider this expression to be valid in all the density range .",
    "the search of an equation of state for the associating system will be thus accomplished if we find an expression for the association degree in terms of known properties .",
    "once this relation has been found , we will obtain an equation of state for the system of n - mers by taking the limit of complete association , i.e. , @xmath44 .",

    "the low density equilibrium constant , @xmath47 , is given as follows : @xmath48 substitution of this expression into eq .",
