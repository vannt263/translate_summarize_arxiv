    "ngc1275 ( perseus a , 3c 84 ) at the center of the perseus cluster has been variously classified as an active galaxy , a merger , a cooling flow galaxy , a bl lac object , and an fri radio jet source .",
    "however , many of its physical characteristics  from x - ray to radio  remain baffling .",
    "ngc1275 exhibits the characteristics of several source types : seyfert ( @xcite ) included it in his original list , minkowski ( @xcite ) called it a galaxy `` collision '' .",
    "the dominant low velocity ( lv ) component ( @xmath3 ) is the giant cd elliptical ngc1275 , the other component ( hv , @xmath4kms@xmath5 ) is probably a nearby spiral galaxy ( at least partially ) in front of the main galaxy ( haschick et al .",
    "@xcite ) . veron ( @xcite ) suggested that ngc1275 was a object , while other authors have suggested that it was more compatible with liners ( e.g. norgaard - nielsen et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "ngc1275 has a powerful , nearly point like x - ray emitting nucleus with a flux of @xmath610@xmath7 ( prieto @xcite ) , which is embedded in an extended halo of diffuse x - ray emitting intracluster gas .",
    "the nucleus of ngc1275 is displaced by about 25 from the center of symmetry of the large scale ( @xmath8 ) cluster gas halo , perhaps due to its peculiar motion through the gas ( bhringer et al .",
    "temperature profiles of the x - ray halo suggest that a `` cooling flow '' of @xmath9 is condensing out of the surrounding intracluster medium onto the galaxy ( fabian et al .",
    "@xcite , cardiel et al .",
    "@xcite ) . as in all cooling flow galaxies ,",
    "the ultimate fate of this purported inflowing material is unclear , but visible band colors and balmer absorption lines spectra characteristic of a0 stars show that at most 10% of the gas can form stars with a standard salpeter imf ( romanishin @xcite ) .",
    "ngc1275 is unique among cooling flow galaxies in that it in fact shows evidence of ongoing star formation .",
    "even by the standards of infrared luminous mergers , ngc1275 has very powerful , extended h@xmath0 emission ( fischer et al .",
    "@xcite ) matched only by ngc6240 ( van der werf et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in ngc1275",
    ", this emission has been speculated to have its origin in the cooling flow , although fast j - shocks , uv pumping , and x - ray heating via supernovae and/or agn also produce strong h@xmath0 emission .",
    "merging events are a likely mechanism for supplying ngc1275 with substantial ( m 3@xmath10m@xmath11 ) quantities of h@xmath0 in giant molecular clouds which are detected through mm wave co observations within the central regions ( inoue et al .",
    "co data also show two kinds of motion : a large ( 5 kpc ) scale rotation which has been attributed to merging / cannibalism , and smaller scale turbulence , attributed to the inflow of cooling flow gas ( reuter et al .",
    "recent 2.6 mm co interferometric observations reveal the majority of the gas to be in a ring structure of radius @xmath12 oriented in the east  west direction .",
    "the ring has a westerly extension up to 30 from the nucleus , and nearly @xmath13 of the total co is on the western side ( inoue et al .",
    "very deep interferometric observations of the nucleus itself show no co absorption from very cold gas , which puts very tight limits on any mass deposition from a cooling flow if the gas cools to nearly 3 ( braine et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    ".observations of ngc1275 with the mpe 3d imaging spectrograph .",

    "can thus be avoided ( mouri @xcite ) . locating these ratios in a ortho - para line ratio plane",
    "provides an independent guide for distinguishing between the relative contribution of x - ray heating , shocks , and uv pumping excitation of h@xmath0 gas in starburst and agn galaxies ( fig .",
    "[ fig - mouri-12 ] ) . as non thermal processes ( e.g. uv pumping in low density gas )",
    "excite high vibrational states more easily than the thermal process , the ratio of two ortho transitions such as r@xmath18 = h@xmath021s(1)/h@xmath010s(1 ) gives an ortho - para balance independent measure of the relative contribution of thermal and non - thermal processes .",
    "the same holds for r@xmath19 = h@xmath010s(2)/h@xmath010s(0 ) .",
    "the expected value of r@xmath18 in the case of pure non thermal excitation under nearly all realistic conditions is r@xmath20 ( black & van dishoeck @xcite ) , while thermal uv excitation gives a value of r@xmath18 near 0 ( sternberg et al .",
    "@xcite ) . from table  [ tab - line - strengths ] , we find r@xmath21 and r@xmath22 , which again , as we noted earlier , puts ngc1275 in the r@xmath18r@xmath19 plane close to the location of ngc6240 ( fig .",
    "[ fig - mouri-12 ] ) .",
    "starburst galaxies like ngc 253 and galactic photodissociation regions generally show r@xmath23 . following this method",
    "one can also define a ratio , r@xmath18 = h@xmath010s(3)/h@xmath010s(1 ) , of two ortho lines which is again independent of the initial ortho - para ratio in the molecular clouds . when placed in this diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig - mouri-12 ] ) , ngc1275 falls near other powerful agns like ngc1068 .",
    "the interpretation of these diagrams tells us that the excitation is mostly `` thermal '' , with a small component appearing as `` nonthermal emission '' .",
    "the gas must then be quite dense , with n@xmath24@xmath25 .",
    "the placement of ngc1275 near other powerful agn and merger galaxies suggests that both x - ray and shock mechanisms may be at work creating the powerful h@xmath0 emission .",
    "hence , based on the spatial extent of the h@xmath0 emission and its temperature , we propose that there are two distinct sources of h@xmath0 excitation : the agn nucleus , which excites the vast majority of the radiation , and which produces the compact emission core seen in our maps , and the extended region of moderate star formation which excites the highly extended , weak h@xmath0 envelope .",
    "the column density of the h@xmath021s(3 ) line is lower by a factor of 3 compared to what could be expected from weighted extrapolation of the 21s(1 ) and 21s(2 ) transitions .",
    "even if the ortho / para ratio within the 21 transitions is not close to 3 , which it was in the 10 transitions , n@xmath26(21s(3 ) ) is still a factor of @xmath27 lower compared to n@xmath26(21s(1 ) ) and using t@xmath28 k for the two ortho states . inspecting the original data and the spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig - k-3secap - spectrum ] did not show any abnormalities .",
    "since the chance for blending the line with a strong absorption can be excluded for this part of the spectrum and the atmosphere , we argue that this weakness of the h@xmath021s(3 ) line is real .",
    "inspecting fig .",
    "[ fig - specfit - k-3 ] reveals that the 21s(1 ) line is also weak outside the nucleus at a radius of @xmath29kpc",
    ". it would be visible if it was 2.5 time stronger or about half the strength of the 10s(2 ) line , which is clearly present .",
    "the only other galaxy , were a weak h@xmath021s(3 ) line has been reported so far , is ngc6240 ( lester et al .",
    "@xcite ) , although only as an upper limit . from their table 3",
    "one can estimate that the column density of 21s(3 ) line in ngc6240 is at least 3.5 times weaker than expected from extrapolating other data , which is in good agreement with our finding and suggest that there may be a common mechanism at work .",
    "the column densities in ngc6240 are only a factor of 2 higher compared with ngc1275 an their derived temperature range is almost identical with fig .",
    "[ fig - h2-exite - temp ] .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the excitation conditions in both galaxies are not identical .",
    "draine & woods ( @xcite ) have shown that in addition to x - ray heating , uv pumping plays a major role in ngc6240 .",
    "this is already indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig - mouri-12 ] as well as and in fig . 4 of lester et al .",
    "( @xcite ) : the large offset between the line through the 10 transitions and the 21 data is different from ngc1275 ( fig .",
    "[ fig - h2-exite - temp ] ) .",
    "recently , sugai et al . ( @xcite ) reported that they were unable to confirm the weakness of the h@xmath021s(3 ) line in ngc6240 with r = 580 grism spectroscopy .",
    "better quality data at higher spectral resolution is certainly required to clarify the situation .    the most likely mechanism for the weakness of the h@xmath021s(3 ) line is resonant fluorescent excitation of the upper level ( @xmath30 = 2 , j= 5 ) by ly@xmath31 photons ( black & van dishoeck @xcite ) .",
    "the ly@xmath31 photons needed for this pumping process can easily be provided in an environment where a notable fraction of the h@xmath0 is excited by x ",
    "ray heating ( black & van dishoeck @xcite ) .",
    "although detailed models of resonant fluorescent excitation of the @xmath32 level does not exist , the weakness of the h@xmath021 s(3 ) line by itself already demonstrates that at least in the nuclear region the excitation of the molecular hydrogen in ngc1275 is dominated by the central agn .",
    "this is in agreement with our previous finding that the excitation environment in the nuclear region of ngc1275 is much more dominated by x - ray heating than in ngc6240 ( draine & woods @xcite ) .",
    "ngc1275 may be the first galaxy for which a more complete model on resonant fluorescent excitation can be computed .",
    "finding other galaxies with such a weak h@xmath021 s(3 ) line ( e.g. in ngc1068 ) would be important for constraining the process , which may provide an additional tool for understanding the radiative interaction between agn and circumnuclear molecular material .",
    "the br@xmath2 emission from ngc1275 is unusual in that it is highly asymmetric both in its line profile ( fig .",
    "[ fig - k-3secap - spectrum ] ) , and in its spatial distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig - brg - line - map ] ) .",
    "the br@xmath2 emission is extended along roughly the same line ( pa = 160@xmath33 ) as the powerful radio jets ( pedlar et al .",
    "@xcite ) , which suggests that the mechanism of its ionization is more strongly influenced by the central engine than by the surrounding stellar population .",
    "this result correlates well with h@xmath31 and [ nii ] maps with visible band imaging spectroscopy ( ferruit & pecontal @xcite ) . in particular , the position of the extension in our maps correlates with an h@xmath31 and [ nii ] emission peak located @xmath34 n , 07 w of the nucleus . from the published h@xmath31 maps",
    ", we estimate the h@xmath31 flux in the hot spot to be @xmath35 w m@xmath36 arcsec@xmath36 . based on the observed [ sii ] line ratios and assuming a temperature of t@xmath37k , ( ferruit & pecontal @xcite ) derive a mean electron density of n@xmath38 for this region , and a typical linewidth of 340 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the intrinsic br@xmath2 linewidth at the nucleus of @xmath39 km s@xmath5 is unusually large for a pure star forming source .",
    "however , the width is not unexpected for emission from nlrs associated with agns and we therfore safely assume here that the nlr contributes a substatial fraction to the br@xmath2 emission .",
    "the larger linewidth of br@xmath2 compared to h@xmath31 is probably a differential extinction effect .",
    "the emission was too faint to derive accurate br@xmath2 line profiles in regions 1 to the nw and se of the nucleus in order to test whether the excess width and shape of the br@xmath2 line is due to expansion .",
    "the total br@xmath2 emission within the central 1kpc is @xmath40 ergs@xmath5 @xmath16 , which is a total luminosity of @xmath41 l@xmath11 .",
    "this corresponds to an ionization rate of @xmath42 s@xmath5 or @xmath43 l@xmath11 for t@xmath44k , and can be compared with the value of @xmath45 s@xmath5 inferred from m82 over a similar region from h53@xmath31 recombination lines ( puxley @xcite ) . from the ionization rate",
    "one can infer the total lyman continuum luminosity l@xmath46 if one assumes ob type stars as its source .",
    "l@xmath47l@xmath11 yields about 1.5% of the l@xmath48 of ngc1275 ( @xmath49l@xmath11 ) or l@xmath48/ l@xmath50 .",
    "l@xmath51l@xmath11 is a lower limit to the lyc - luminosity in the iras beam .",
    "the total bolometric luminosity of such an evolving stellar cluster is typically about 10 - 20 times higher than the lyman continuum luminosity for typical assumptions on the properties of such a region if it were an active star forming region powered by massive stars ( age @xmath52 a few 10@xmath53y , m@xmath54m@xmath11 , m@xmath55m@xmath11 , see fig . 10 in krabbe",
    "@xcite ) . with that ratio l@xmath56l@xmath11 , which is about 25% of l@xmath48 . taken as face values",
    "these numbers are not very consistent with star formation but much more with what one gets empirically , using above formulas for agns ( genzel et al .",
    "the 1.644 @xmath57 m emission from ngc1275 is very strong ( fig .",
    "[ fig - h-3secap - spectrum ] ) and centrally concentrated ( fig .",
    "[ fig - feii - line - map ] ) .",
    "other prominent h and k band iron lines include the 1.534 @xmath57 m , 2.2178 @xmath57 m , and 2.2420 @xmath57 m , in a near blend with h@xmath021s(1 ) .",
    "the flux of the 1.644 @xmath57 m ( table  [ tab - line - strengths ] ) is nearly as large as the 1.257 @xmath57 m in an 8 aperture by ( rudy et al .",
    "the emission is much stronger compared to other starburst / seyfert indicators than it is in most active galaxies .",
    "for example , in the central 1kpc of ngc1275 , we find ( @xmath581.644)/br@xmath2 = 6.3 , whereas in roughly similar sized regions in the merger driven starburst ngc3256 /br@xmath2 = 1.55 and in the starburst / seyfert systems ngc4945 /br@xmath2 = 1.4 ( moorwood & oliva @xcite ) and ngc1068 ( thatte et al . , in preparation ; blietz et al .",
    "@xcite ) . while br@xmath2 originates predominantly from photoionization of regions by ob stars , has an additional source .",
    "most of the gas phase fe in the local ism condenses onto grains , so that the free fe is often depleted by factors of 100  1000 . if we presume that the ionization characteristics of the central source in ngc1275 are similar to those of ngc3256 , ngc4945 , and ngc1068 , then the unusual /br@xmath2 and / ratios ( e.g. rudy et al .",
    "@xcite ) would suggest that the iron depletion is 10 in ngc1275 , less severe than in most starburst and active galaxies",
    ". this could be due to an ambient radiation field which heats the dust grains and tends to evaporate the fe off of them .",
    "such a scenario is supported by the relatively high derived dust temperature within the central 300pc ( e.g. , sect.[sec - decomposition ] ) .",
    "alternatively , the fact that the ionization state of the gas must allow for plentiful fe@xmath59 , which can then be further ionized by photons with @xmath60 ev , requires that the ionizing source of radiation must be relatively cool , in order to produce low ionization radiation which would produce the high /br@xmath2 line ratios",
    ". however , fast j - shocks and x - ray heating can also produce copious emission ( blietz et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in the latter case ,",
    "the x - rays penetrate deep into molecular clouds where they create large reservoirs of partially ionized gas .",
    "the profile of the 1.644 @xmath57 m line can not be well modeled as a single gaussian .",
    "this is typical of seyfert galaxies , which often show narrow and broad components of the same emission feature .",
    "we therefore fit the observed profile using two gaussians , a broad component of width @xmath61 km s@xmath5 and relative amplitude of @xmath62 , and a narrow component of of width @xmath63 km s@xmath5 .",
    "this two component fit ( fig .",
    "[ fig - feii - profile ] ) , is excellent , and suggests that @xmath64 of the emission arises in the same region as the br@xmath2 , showing a similar linewidth , while the other half of the arises in the same region as the h@xmath0 , where the linewidths are again similar .",
    "hence we propose  as in the case of the h@xmath0 lines ( sect.[sec - h2-excitation ] )  that the active nucleus of ngc1275 is responsible for much of the excitation leading to emission . comparing this result with blietz et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , who have found an excellent correlation between the emission and the nlr in ngc1068 suggests , that we might have a similar case here but unresolved and at much greater distance .",
    "the detailed line ratios expected from excitation via a central agn have been modeled by hollenbach & maloney ( @xcite ) . in their model , the x - ray energy absorbed per unit time per hydrogen nucleus in a cloud at distance 100r@xmath65",
    "pc is h@xmath66 l@xmath67r@xmath68n@xmath69 ergs@xmath5 , where @xmath70l@xmath67 erg s@xmath5 is the agn luminosity and @xmath71n@xmath72 @xmath16 is the total column density .",
    "the heating rate is @xmath730.4 h@xmath74 , and the cooling is due to line emission from many species , but of particular diagnostic interest are the h@xmath010s(1 ) and 1.64 @xmath57 m lines . using our value of n@xmath75 @xmath16 , a molecular abundance of h / h@xmath0 @xmath76 , and l@xmath77 erg s@xmath5 ( prieto @xcite ) , and integrating the hollenbach & maloney results over our resolution beam of 300pc",
    ", we can account for the observed to h@xmath010s(1 ) line ratio .",
    "for all radii larger than our beam , the predicted ratio is @xmath78 .",
    "this is close to our measured value of 1.5:1 in a 3aperture ( table  [ tab - line - strengths ] ) since the predicted ratio depends on the presumed depletion of fe , which we already know to be @xmath79 , and which the model presumes to be @xmath80 ( hollenbach , private communication ) .",
    "we thus conclude that the emission as well as /h@xmath010s(1 ) can be explained by an x  radiation field typically emitted by agn .",
    "the co@xmath81 index of the underlying stellar population can be diluted by continuum emission not originating in stars .",
    "if the non - stellar continuum is @xmath82 times stronger than the stellar continuum , the co@xmath81 index will be diminished according to @xmath83 where s@xmath84 is the average of the undiluted rectified spectrum between 2.31 and 2.40 @xmath57 m and co@xmath81 is the spectroscopic index .",
    "details are given in  doyon et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . according to our model fitting , the non - stellar continuum in",
    "the central 1 contributes @xmath85 of the emission , reducing the observed co@xmath81 from its intrinsic value of @xmath73 to @xmath86 , and and giving rise to the co@xmath81 hole at the nucleus of ngc1275 ( fig .",
    "[ fig - co - index ] ) .",
    "the range for the allowed values of the intrinsic co@xmath81 is indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig - co - dilution - check ] .",
    "the nuclear stellar cluster may have a higher co index than initially assumed , implying that the k supergiants with co@xmath87 instead of giants may be the dominating population ( doyon et al .",
    "@xcite ) . including this finding into a reiteration on the continuum decomposition will not have any effect on the results , since the temperature of these stellar types are not very different .    outside of the hole ,",
    "the co@xmath81 of 0.17 is typical of e / s0 galaxies ( frogel et al .",
    "@xcite ) , confirming that the stellar population of ngc1275 is quite normal .",
    "furthermore co@xmath88 corresponds to a star ( doyon et al.@xcite , appendix a ) , which corroborates our spectral synthesis results for regions at r 3 .",
    "given that the light is dominated by k giants or supergiants , we try to estimate the total nuclear stellar mass . using our result that the emission enclosed in the central 3 ( 1kpc ) of ngc1275 is @xmath89 due to non - stellar sources",
    ", we correct the observed k magnitude of the _ stellar component only _ of m@xmath90 [ in agreement with other recent values m@xmath91 ( forbes et al .",
    "@xcite ) ] to m@xmath92 . converting to absolute visual magnitudes yields m@xmath93 ( ngc1275)=(v - k ) + m@xmath94a@xmath95 log d@xmath96 using v - k= 3.24 , a@xmath97 , and d = 68.8mpc .",
    "the mass of a k giant is 1.2 m@xmath11 , and its m@xmath98 ( lang @xcite ) , which implies @xmath99 m@xmath11 of stars in the central 3 .    assuming a salpeter imf with p(m)@xmath100m@xmath101 dm , the mass fraction of the stars in the range 1.0 to 1.5 m@xmath11 ( roughly the range of stellar masses which will become stars ) , for a population bounded by 0.1 m@xmath11 and 100 m@xmath11 stars is @xmath102 , so that stars make up about 7% of the mass of a star cluster .",
    "hence the total mass of stars in the central kpc is thus @xmath103 m@xmath11 .",
    "if the population is dominated by k supergiants , the total stellar mass comes out to be the same value ( mass range = 12  14 m@xmath11 m@xmath104 ) .",
    "we estimate the core radius r@xmath105 of the nuclear stellar cluster to be smaller than 500 pc . using this value as an upper limit and knowing the stellar mass of the cluster",
    ", we can use @xmath106 ( eckart et al .",
    "@xcite ) to estimate the expected velocity dispersion : @xmath107 km / s .",
    "even if the co absorption had been detected on the nucleus , such a small dispersion had been beyond the capabilities of our instrument .",
    "we conclude that the absence of co bandheads in the nuclear emission indicates that those bandheads are heavily diluted by the emission of hot dust and power - law emission .",
    "our spectral synthesis ( sect.[sec - cont - emission ] ) shows that inside of the central @xmath108 , the nir continuum emission is dominated by the agn and hot dust components .",
    "together these are 10 times more powerful than the stellar emission from the same region .",
    "this result is confirmed by the observed factor of 10 continuum co@xmath81 dilution ( sect.[sec - co - index ] ) at the nucleus .",
    "the nature of the nuclear power source likely is a massive black hole ( mbh ) with a surrounding molecular gas cloud torus or disk .",
    "the lack of strong co absorption bands indicates that massive star formation probably does not play a very important role in the nucleus .",
    "the intensity and morphology of the line emission suggest that more than one mechanism is at work exciting the line emission .",
    "in addition to the agn , shocks are also likely to play a large role .",
    "since the j band lines are unusually strong , even for an agn , it requires a substantial boost of the h@xmath0 emission to keep the [ feii]/h@xmath010s(1 ) ratio near unity .",
    "this is indeed observed in ngc1275 , which has unusually strong h@xmath0 emission compared to other seyferts .",
    "furthermore , the spatial extension of the h@xmath0 emission ( sect.[sec - h2-distribution ] ) suggests that it may be driven by shocks from a recent or ongoing merger event .",
    "such a picture is supported by not only the observed isophotal shell structure ( hernquist & weil @xcite ) , but also by the extinction analysis of norgaard - nielsen et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , which shows that the hv system is at least partially _ moving through _ the main galaxy rather than completely in front of it .",
    "hence the interaction of the hv and lv systems could give rise to the required shocks which boost the h@xmath0 emission .",
    "this process is postulated to occur in the merging galaxy ngc6240 ( van der werf et al .",
    "@xcite ) . among agns ,",
    "strong emission is not unique to ngc1275 .",
    "in fact there are a large number of agns with elevated emission ( among them many iras luminous and starburst galaxies such as mrk231 , mrk507 , and phl1092 ) , which can be attributed to violent star formation in a metal rich environment ( fillipenko & terlevich @xcite , lipari et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in the merger induced",
    "h@xmath0 boosting scenario , the unusually high level of emission observed from ngc1275 would likely be due to a different effect , namely the dissociation of fe from interstellar grains via shock heating .",
    "this could produce an iron rich gas phase ( sect.[sec - fe - excitation ] ) , which would then give rise to the very strong observed emission .",
    "the fact that the br@xmath2 emission is generally extended suggests the presence of young stars and thus extended recent star formation .",
    "if the slight extension of the continuum is significant , it suggests increased star formation along the jets , perhaps due to shocks , caused by interactions with the surrounding medium .",
    "part of the br@xmath2 emission along the radio jet may be influenced by the radiation from the nucleus and thus not created by star formation .",
    "the extended component of hot molecular hydrogen is probably shock excited as a result of the star formation .",
    "the existence ( or non - existence ) of `` cooling flows ''  an inflow of cool gas into a galaxy from its halo of hot x - ray emitting gas  is currently a topic of intense debate .",
    "the evidence _ for _ them is that some galaxies which are surrounded by a halo of hot , x - ray emitting gas show a dramatic central drop in the gas temperature .",
    "as the primary cooling mechanism of this gas is bremsstrahlung ( emission @xmath109 n@xmath110 ) , and as the central temperature drop is accompanied by a brightness increase , the gas must be both cooler and denser ( see , e.g. sarazin et al .",
    "@xcite for a physical introduction and review ) .",
    "if the gas is cooler and denser , then it must fall toward the center of the galaxy . in the case of ngc1275 ,",
    "the predicted infall amounts to @xmath111 m@xmath11yr@xmath5 ( fabian et al .",
    "@xcite ) , or @xmath112 m@xmath11 in @xmath113 years .",
    "the evidence _ against _ cooling flows is that if such enormous quantities of gas really are falling in , they must be detectable in some way , yet careful searches have not revealed the gas in any of its expected states . we know that the gas can not form stars with a normal imf , because 200m@xmath11 of star formation would be 20 times more powerful than the prototypical starburst galaxy , m82 , and easily detected via color variations ( cardiel et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "our h@xmath0 data provide several evidences against the cooling flow hypothosis .",
    "_ i _ ) the spatial distribution of the hot molecular hydrogen strongly peaks at the nucleus of ngc1275 on a scale @xmath114300pc . if the h@xmath0 emission was due to the cooling flow , one would have expexted a much more extended distribution since the gas has to fall through all of the galaxy .",
    "the weakness of the h@xmath021s(3 ) line ( see sect.[sec-2 - 1s3-strength ] ) emphasises the close relation of the hot h@xmath0 with the nucleus .",
    "_ ii _ ) the temperature variation within the hot h@xmath0 is small . between 0k and about 20000k upper level energy",
    "the temperature only varies by about 1500k .",
    "a cooling hot gas cloud is likely to show a much larger span of temperature compared to what our data show .",
    "_ iii _ ) the temperature of the hot h@xmath0 is rather low : between 1500k and 3000 k. there is no evidence of a very hot ( 3000 k ) h@xmath0 component which can be expected for a cooling hot gas mass .    _",
    "iv _ the line emission of the hot h@xmath0 can be explained consistently with mostly thermal excitation ( e.g. in a postshock environment ) with a smaller component of x  ray heating .",
    "a `` cooling flow '' scenario does not need to be invoked to explain the line emission of molecular hydrogen in ngc1275 .",
    "several groups have argued that the gas can not have collected in the form of molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath0 ) , because searches for co emission associated with h@xmath0 have revealed only very limited quantities of h@xmath0 gas , although ngc1275 is unusual in that it shows more co than most cooling flow galaxies ( lazareff et al .",
    "@xcite , inoue et al @xcite , odea et al .",
    "however , since the temperature regime is very different from the cold molecular clouds , the co @xmath115 h@xmath0 conversion factor is certainly different and may even not be applicable in this context .",
    "the gas could have been collected as atomic hydrogen .",
    "however , only very limited quantities have been detected , certainly much less than would be expected from an infall of several hundred solar masses per year over cosmic timescales ( haschick et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "one of the last places in which the purported inflow could be hiding is in stars with a very unusual kind of imf , one that is biased toward producing low mass stars , so that the star formation rate as determined by the total number of ionizing photons ( these are produced only by massive stars ) does not reflect the total amount of mass involved in the star formation process .",
    "a population of such low mass stars should have a somewhat lower co@xmath81 index than a normal population , because it will have fewer luminous giants and supergiants which are the largest contributors to the co absorption lines .",
    "our nir spectroscopy allows us to analyze the stellar population of regions 1kpc from the nucleus via the co@xmath81 index , where we find a co@xmath88 .",
    "this can be compared with theoretical predictions for a population of very low mass stars ( see fig .",
    "20 in kroupa & gilmore @xcite ) , whose expected value of co@xmath81 is between 0.07 and 0.16 for cooling flow rates of 158 m@xmath11 yr@xmath5 . for higher mass deposition rates , the expected co@xmath81 decreases ,",
    "so that for a rate of 316m@xmath11 yr@xmath5 the expected co@xmath81 lies between 0.0 and 0.1 .",
    "hence we can not completely eliminate the existence of a low mass star population for a cooling flow of 200m@xmath11 yr@xmath5 as is postulated for ngc1275 , but the observed co@xmath81 index is at the extreme limit of theoretically acceptable values .",
    "we observed the central 1kpc of ngc1275 with the mpe 3d imaging spectrograph .",
    "we find that the central @xmath116pc are strongly dominated by emission from an agn and from hot dust : there is no evidence of a nuclear stellar continuum . in the regions at a distance of @xmath29kpc from the nucleus ,",
    "the situation is completely reversed , and the emission is totally dominated by a stellar population whose spectra is consistent with a normal , old ( @xmath117 y ) population . in this region",
    ", we find no evidence to support the thesis that substantial quantities of infalling `` cooling flow '' gas has been transformed into stars with an imf biased toward low masses , although we can not strictly rule out a low mass population because the purported flow may be disturbed in the central 10kpc of the galaxy . within the central @xmath118pc ,",
    "the emission line ratios of many important diagnostic lines from the nir regime are consistent with excitation from a combination of agn emission and shock excitation .",
    "the shocks may be due to previous mergers , or to the early phases of a merger between the hv and lv systems .",
    "we thank the 3d team for their enthusiastic support during the observations .",
    "the total intrinsic continuum emission at each wavelength @xmath58 is @xmath119 in active and starburst galaxies , we identify four sources of continuum emission : stellar ( @xmath120 ) , agn power - law(@xmath121 ) and hot dust ( @xmath122 ) , and free - free ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "the intrinsic emission of @xmath124 is then extincted according to @xmath125 to obtain the synthetic spectrum .",
    "the extinction has two parts , one due to dust within our galaxy ( @xmath126 ) , and one due to dust within the source galaxy ( @xmath127 ) . in our model ,",
    "the latter can have either a simple screen geometry or a mixed stars / gas geometry . in all cases ,",
    "the extinction is taken to vary as @xmath128 ( landini et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and is fixed to be a@xmath129 a@xmath130 at @xmath131 m ( rieke & lebofsky @xcite ) .    when comparing @xmath132 with the observed spectrum , @xmath133 , we avoid emission lines due to non - continuum sources ( e.g. shocked ism gas , photoionized gas clouds ) , and define our goodness of fit parameter , @xmath134 , such that @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the number of measured spectral points which contain no line emission or absorption from non - continuum sources and @xmath137 is the local noise .    to model the stellar component , we have resampled the r@xmath138 normalized k band spectra of kleinmann & hall ( @xcite ) at the 3d resolution of r = 670 onto our @xmath139 m pix@xmath5 data format ( frster et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and then multiplied them by a rayleigh - jeans power law of @xmath140 ( doyon et al .",
    "@xcite ) corresponding to an a0v star to reconstruct the true stellar spectrum .",
    "the intrinsic spectrum of the hot dust of temperature t@xmath141 , is taken to be a black body multiplied by a power - law emissivity of the form @xmath142 .",
    "hence , @xmath143 , where b@xmath144 is the black body function .",
    "the behavior of free - free emission is given by @xmath145 where t is the plasma temperature ( normally @xmath146k ) .",
    "we convert to wavelength units , and find @xmath147 which we adopt as our functional form for free - free emission ."
