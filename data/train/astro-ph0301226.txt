    "it is believed that with the new generation of observational projects not only a more accurate determination of the main cosmological parameters but also a discrimination between general quintessence models and @xmath7cdm scenarios ( @xmath13 ) will be possible .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the presence of a dark energy component is necessary in order to fit observational results with theoretical predictions , its nature still remains a completely open question giving rise to the so - called dark energy problem . in this way ,",
    "an important task nowadays in cosmology is to find new methods or to revive old ones in order to quantify the amount of dark energy present in the universe , as well as to determine its equation of state and/or its time dependence . in this concern ,",

    ", we analyze the constraints on the cosmological parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 from the age estimates of this object ( hasinger _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 ; see also komossa & hasinger 2002 ) .",
    "the main aim here is to convert the estimated lower bounds on the dimensionless age parameter for this object to lower ( upper ) limits on @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "some possible constraints on the first epoch of quasar formation are also discussed .",
    "our approach is based on alcaniz & lima ( 1999 ; 2001 ) .",
    "the age - redshift relation for a spatially flat , homogeneous , and isotropic cosmologies with an extra smooth component ( @xmath18 ) reads @xmath19 note that for @xmath13 the above expression reduces to the well known result for @xmath7cdm scenarios ( @xmath20 ) whereas for @xmath21 the standard relation , @xmath22 , is readily recovered .",
    "as can be easily seen from the above equation limits on the cosmological parameters @xmath23 and @xmath17 can be readily obtained by fixing the product @xmath24 from observations .",
    "note also that such an age parameter depends only on the product of the two quantities @xmath25 and @xmath26 , which are measured from completely independent methods . to clarify these points , in what follows we briefly outline our main assumptions for this analysis .",
    "following standard lines , we take for granted that the age of the universe at a given redshift is bigger than or at least equal to the age of its oldest objects . as one may conclude , for quintessence or @xmath7cdm scenarios , the comparison of these two quantities implies a lower ( upper ) bound for @xmath27 ( @xmath17 ) , since the age of the universe increases ( decreases ) for larger values of this quantity . in order to quantify these qualitative arguments , it is convenient to introduce the ratio ( alcaniz & lima 1999 ) @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the age of an arbitrary object , say , a quasar or a galaxy at a given redshift @xmath15 and @xmath30 is the dimensionless factor defined in eq .",

    ", the denominator of the above equation defines a dimensionless age parameter @xmath31 . in particular , for the 2.0-gyr - old quasar at @xmath14 yields",
    "@xmath32gyr which , for the most recent determinations of the hubble parameter , @xmath33 @xmath34 ( freedman _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) , takes values on the interval @xmath35 .",
    "it follows that @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , for a given value of @xmath25 , only models having an expanding age bigger than this value at @xmath37 will be compatible with the existence of this object . in particular , taking @xmath38 ( the standard flat case ) in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , one obtains @xmath39 , which means that the einstein - de sitter model is formally ruled out by this test with great confidence ( komossa & hasinger 2002 ) . in order to assure the robustness of our analysis",
    ", we will adopt in our computations the lower bound for the above mentioned value of the hubble parameter , i.e. , @xmath40 @xmath34 .",
    "0.1 in    to what extent does the hasinger _",
    "( 2002 ) result provide new constraints on the cosmological parameters @xmath41 and @xmath17 ? to answer this question in figs .",
    "1a and 1b we show the dimensionless age parameter @xmath42 as a function of the redshift for several values of @xmath16 .",
    "the shadowed regions in the graphs were determined from the minimal value of @xmath43 .",
    "it means that any curve crossing the rectangles yields an age parameter smaller than the minimal value required by the presence of of the quasar apm 08279 + 5255 .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "1a that by assuming an age estimate of 2 gyr the minimal value for the vacuum energy density is @xmath3 , which provides , for the above considered hubble parameter interval , a minimal total age of @xmath44 12 .",
    "8 - 16.0 gyr .",
    "this value of @xmath16 is only marginally in accordance with most of the recent observational data which seem to point out to a flat universe with @xmath45 ( see , for example , peebles & ratra ( 2002 ) for a recent review ) .",
    "we recall at this point , in line with the arguments presented by komossa & hasinger ( 2002 ) , that recent x - ray observations show an fe / o ratio for the quasar apm 08279 + 5255 that is compatible with an age of 3 gyr . in this case ,",
    "1b shows that the minimal value of @xmath16 required in order to make flat @xmath7cdm scenarios compatible with the existence of this object is @xmath46 .",
    "such a lower limit is much higher than the value that can be inferred from an elementary combination of cmb measurements pointing to @xmath47 ( de bernardis _ et al . _ 2000 ; jaffe _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) and clustering estimates giving @xmath6 ( calberg _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) or from a rigorous statistical analysis involving many astrophysical constraints ( harun - or - rashid & roos 2001 ) .",
    "naturally , we do not expect such results to be free of observational and/or theoretical uncertainties ( see , for example , hamann & ferland 1993 and chartas _ et al .",
    "however , if independent analyses confirm such estimates the existence of this quasar brings to light a new consistency problem between this particular result and several others discussed recently in the literature .",
    "0.1 in    figure 2 shows a similar analysis for quintessence scenarios .",
    "now , instead of plotting the age - redshift diagram for these models we show the parameter space in which contours represent the minimal value of the age parameter discussed above . as can be seen , although restrictive constraints can be placed on the matter density parameter ( in line with the above discussion ) ,",
    "the upper limits on the quintessence equation of state are not so tight .",
    "this happens basically because at this redshift the age parameter is not a very sensitive function to the equation of state parameter @xmath17 .",
    "in particular , we found @xmath48 and @xmath49 and @xmath50 and @xmath51 for an age estimate of 2 and 3 gyr , respectively .",
    "such bounds on @xmath17 are very similar to that ones obtained from the age estimates of the radio galaxies lbds 53w069 , lbds 53w091 and 3c 65 , although the limits on @xmath52 are now much more restrictive ( lima & alcaniz 2000 ) .",
    "the latter aspect is particularly noticeable to the case of a cosmological constant ( @xmath53 ) . from figure 2",
    "we see that for a @xmath7cdm universe , the density parameter is just the extreme value , @xmath54 , when the lower limit of 2 gyr is considered . however , by taking 3 gyr as the real age of the quasar one finds the second extreme value , namely , @xmath55 .",
    "both results disagree completely with the recent limits on @xmath52 obtained from x - ray measurements of galaxy clusters ( allen _ et al .",
    "the main results of this analysis are presented in table i.    0.1 in    .limits to @xmath41 and @xmath17 [ cols= \" > , < , < \" , ]",
    "at this point we change the focus of our discussion to investigate possible constraints on the epoch of quasar formation from the age estimate of the quasar apm 08279 + 5255 . in order to infer such limits",
    "we do not consider in our computations the time necessary for the quasar formation .",
    "in other words , the reasonable assumption of an incubation time will be totally neglected in our analysis .",
    "this means that any limit on the redshift formation @xmath56 will be a conservative lower bound . for look - back time calculations",
    ", such a hypothesis can be translated as ( alcaniz & lima 2001 ) @xmath57 where the inequality signal comes from the fact that the universe is older than or at least has the same age of any observed structure .",
    "since this natural argument also holds for any time interval , a finite value for the @xmath56 will contribute to make our lower limits on the epoch of quasar formation even more conservative .",
    "naturally , models for which @xmath58 are clearly incompatible with the existence of this particular object , thereby being ruled out in a natural way .    in fig .",
    "3a we show the @xmath59 plane allowed by the existence of the quasar apm 08279 + 5255 for @xmath7cdm models .",
    "as before , two age estimates were assumed : 2 gyr ( dashed curve ) and 3 gyr ( solid curve ) . as should be physically expected ,",
    "since the effect of dark matter is decelerate the cosmic expansion and @xmath56 is smaller for larger values of @xmath52 . ] , the larger the contribution of @xmath52 the larger the value of @xmath56 that is required in order to account for the existence of this quasar within these cosmological scenarios . in this way",
    ", the smallest value for the formation redshift occurs for a completely empty universe ( @xmath60 ) . from figure 3",
    "one may see that @xmath61 . for a low - density universe with @xmath62",
    "we obtain @xmath63 . as expected from the previous analysis , @xmath64 when the matter density parameter approaches to 0.22 .",
    "the problem related to the lower limits for the total age of the universe , as inferred from age estimates of globular clusters ( at @xmath65 ) , was a recurrent problem in the development of physical cosmology .",
    "in actual fact , it was a real source of progress for cosmology ever since the hubble discovery of the expanding universe .    in a similar vein , old high redshift objects may play an equivalent role to the question related to the ultimate fate of the universe .",
    "their age estimates provide a powerful technique for constraining the basic cosmological parameters .",
    "in particular , the so - called high redshift  age crisis \" is now becoming an important complement to other independent cosmological tests .",
    "as we have seen , the constraints on the @xmath52 - @xmath16 plane based solely on the recent age estimates of the apm 08279 + 5255 quasar are very restrictive .",
    "actually , the analysis presented here is more restrictive than the earlier results derived from age estimates of some old high redshift galaxies ( alcaniz & lima 1999 ) .",
    "it should be stressed that the present constraints on the formation redshift are indeed rather conservative since the lower limit on the age of the apm quasar has been considered in all the estimate and the possible incubation time has also been neglected in the original work .",
    "finally , these high limits on @xmath56 are also in line with the current idea that old objects are not uncommom at very large redshifts , say , at @xmath66 , and also reinforce the interest on the observational search for quasars , galaxies and other callapsed objects within the redshift interval @xmath67 , which nowadays delimits the so - called dark zone .",
