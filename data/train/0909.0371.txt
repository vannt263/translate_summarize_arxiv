    "a long standing problem in astrophysics concerns the mechanism of accretion that compact objects manifest in the presence of lower dense companions .",
    "it is well established by observations@xcite that such an accretion profile takes place often with the morphology of a thin disk configuration . since from the very beginning of these studies , increasing interest raised about the details of the angular momentum transport across the disk structure .",
    "the solution of this problem appears settled down in the case of a compact object , for which the intrinsic magnetic field does not exert a significant lorenz force on the elementary charged constituents of the in - falling plasma . in this limit , the fluid - dynamics description appears well - grounded and the resulting axisymmetric configurations well understood ( see among the first analyses of the problem@xcite ; for a relativistic analysis of plasma accreting into a black hole , see @xcite ) . in the fluid - dynamics paradigm ,",
    "the accretion mechanism relies on an angular momentum transfer which is allowed by the shear viscosity properties of the disk material .",
    "the differential angular rotation of different disk layers is associated with a non - zero viscosity coefficient , which accounts for the diffusion and turbulence phenomena emerging in the micro - scale structure of the fluid .",
    "however , when the magnetic field of the central object is sufficiently high , the electromagnetic back - reaction of the disk plasma becomes very important .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the lorenz force introduces a crucial coupling between the radial and the vertical equilibrium , which deeply alters the morphology of the system .",
    "in particular , the radial dependence of all the fundamental quantities acquires an oscillating character , modulating the background profile .",
    "furthermore , as outlined in @xcite , when the disk plasma is characterised by a @xmath0-parameter close to the unity , such an oscillating - like behaviour stands as the dominant effect and the disk is indeed decomposed in a ring profile .",
    "however , such a two - mhd approach is pursued neglecting the accretion rate of the disk in the leading order and thus avoiding the problem concerning the azimuthal balance of the force acting on the electrons .",
    "in fact , in these two works , toroidal currents and matter fluxes are addressed only .",
    "this question about a consistent electron force balance along the azimuthal direction ( the azimuthal electric field is request to vanish by the axial symmetry ) affects also those works where the @xmath1-dependence of the system is averaged out for a thin disk@xcite .",
    "thus , the possibility of presenting a self - consistent mhd description for an accreting disk configuration , calls significant attention , especially in view of the implication that the disk morphology can have on the formation of jets from compact astrophysical structures@xcite . for a discussion which properly traces the way to face this relevant configuration problem ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "this paper presents a solution to the two - dimensional mhd structure of a thin accretion disk , in the linear regime , when the role of a nernst coefficient ( the so - called plasma thermal power ) is taken into account .",
    "in particular , we are reconciling the oscillating behaviour outlined by b. coppi , with the accretion features of the disk .",
    "in fact , in our model , radial and vertical velocities are included in the problem , still retaining the poloidal character of the currents living in the plasma .",
    "the resulting equilibrium configuration is associated with a radial velocity which , following the poloidal currents , oscillates as a function of the radial coordinates and decays in the vertical direction . despite its oscillating - like character , this local radial velocity is responsible for a non - zero accretion rate and it describes a mechanism for the appearance of a steady matter flux , able to enforce the ring - profile associated with the crystalline structure .",
    "nonetheless , the oscillating character of this radial velocity prevents a real matter in - fall toward the centre of symmetry .",
    "thus , a real accretion of the central object seems to require , in this scheme , the presence of non - linear mhd features ; but the local character of the model does not allow to properly characterise the global accretion profile of the central object , that could imply a connection with the boundary layer physics@xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we present a description of the main features characterising an accretion disk model .",
    "the tools needed to construct the configuration scheme are provided .",
    "section [ sec3 ] is devoted to fix the local nature of the model , properly defining the addressed approximations .",
    "in section [ sec4 ] , we build up the system of partial differential equations which governs the two - dimensional mhd equilibrium , by assigning the radial , vertical and azimuthal force balance .",
    "section [ sec5 ] is concerned with the analysis of the linearised equations , based on the assumption that the magnetic field induced into the plasma , by the presence of the toroidal currents is much less in strength than the external field , given by the central object .",
    "section [ sec6 ] faces the discussion of the electron force balance equation , by introducing a non - zero and constant nernst coefficient to preserve the presence of radial and vertical non - vanishing components of the matter velocity .",
    "finally we develop some phenomenological consideration on the model , mainly aimed to estimate the strength of the radial velocity and the associated accretion rate .",
    "furthermore , we fix the condition to neglect the temperature gradients into the radial equilibrium .",
    "brief concluding remarks follow in section [ secconclusioni ] .",
    "let us fix here the basic statements concerning the steady mhd regime for the specific case of an accretion disk configuration around a compact astrophysical object ( a mass over the critical value to have a neutron star within a radius of few kilometres ) , which is also strongly magnetised ( a dipole - like field of about @xmath2 ) .",
    "thus , we deal with a typical pulsar , accreting material from a binary companion via a thin disk structure made up of rotating plasma in equilibrium .    to adapt the mhd equations to the disk symmetry , we introduce cylindrical coordinates @xmath3 .",
    "the gravitational potential of the pulsar takes , in this coordinates , the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the newton s constant and @xmath6 the mass of the spherical central object , while the self - gravitation of the disk is regarded as a negligible effect .    to describe the magnetic field ,",
    "we take the potential vector in the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are arbitrary functions , but only the last one is a physical degree of freedom , since the magnetic field reads - component of the magnetic field can also be included in the theory by a generic term @xmath10 , taken , for instance , as a function of @xmath11 ( i.e. @xmath12 ) . for the sake of simplicity and in agreement with coppi ( 2005)@xcite and coppi - rousseau ( 2006)@xcite , in our treatment we will fix this component equal to zero . ]",
    "@xmath13 the flux function has to be decomposed as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 accounts for the dipole - like magnetic field of the pulsar ( i.e. @xmath16 , with @xmath17 ) , while @xmath18 is a contribution due to the toroidal currents rising in the disk configuration . recalling that the axial symmetry prevents any dependence on the azimuthal angle @xmath19 of all the quantities involved in the problem , the continuity equation , associated to the mass density @xmath20 and to the velocity field @xmath21 , takes the explicit form @xmath22 which admits the solution @xmath23 @xmath24 being a generic function , but for its odd symmetry in the @xmath1-coordinate .",
    "this property has to be required in order to ensure that the accretion rate of the disk , as averaged over the vertical direction , be non - vanishing , i.e. @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the half depth of the disk and we recall that @xmath27 on the vertical average , to ensure a real accretion of the disk .    the different symmetry of the functions @xmath11 and @xmath28 with respect to the @xmath1-dependence , prevents to fix _ a priori _ a relation between them .",
    "the angular velocity @xmath29 , describing the differential rotation of the disk , is an even function of @xmath1 and , by virtue of the corotation theorem@xcite , can be taken as a function of the flux surfaces , i.e. @xmath30",
    ".    the momentum transfer through the disk structure is characterised by an azimuthal friction between the radial layers , properly described by a viscosity coefficient @xmath31 , responsible for the corresponding non - vanishing stress tensor components .",
    "the coefficient @xmath31 can be decomposed as @xmath32 , where the @xmath33 component is associated with the additional effects arising from the toroidal currents .",
    "the necessity to include the electromagnetic back - reaction terms in the viscosity coefficient , is a consequence of the specific coupling such back - reaction establishes .",
    "in fact , it was demonstrated@xcite that the currents induced in the plasma of the disk , provide an intrinsic local coupling between the radial and the vertical equilibrium , absent in the lowest - order approximation .",
    "let us now specialise our model to the case of a thin disk , i.e. @xmath34 over the whole configuration . on average ,",
    "the dominant contribution to the angular velocity of the plasma particles , is then the ( equatorial ) keplerian value @xmath35 .    for a thin disk ,",
    "the @xmath1-component of the velocity can be properly identified ( see shakura ( 1973 ) @xcite ) with the sound velocity @xmath36 ( @xmath37 denoting the boltzmann constant , @xmath38 the plasma temperature , and @xmath39 the ion mass ) , entering the fundamental inequality @xmath40 which ensures the possibility to neglect the vertical motion with respect to the azimuthal one .    to estimate on average the ratio between the radial velocity and the azimuthal one , we can follow the simple equilibrium condition to fix the asymptotic radial velocity of a plasma element falling into the disk @xmath41 @xmath42 being a characteristic frequency of particle collision .",
    "a rough estimation provides @xmath43 , where @xmath44 denotes the number density .",
    "taking @xmath45 and @xmath46 , we get @xmath47 , a value much greater than the typical keplerian frequency .",
    "thus , we conclude that @xmath48 is , in practice , responsible for the main matter flow within the disk , despite its stationary accretion takes place along the radial direction .    in this limit of approximation , the mhd condition on the balance of the lorenz force has dominant radial and vertical components , providing the electric field in the form expected by the corotation theorem , i.e. @xmath49 @xmath50 denoting the electrostatic potential . however , the axial symmetry prevents a dependence of @xmath50 on the azimuthal angle and hence , the corresponding @xmath19-component of the electric field vanishes identically .",
    "this fact requires an additional effect to be included into the problem , able to balance the non - vanishing lorenz force in the azimuthal direction , due to the velocity components @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "we will address this crucial question in section 6 , in the limit of a linear theory .    in the thin disk approximation",
    ", the strength of the gravitational field @xmath53 reads as @xmath54 we see that a thin disk configuration is justified only in the presence of a sufficiently high rotation to deal with a confining vertical gravitational force ( for the linear scheme , here addressed , the lorenz force can not affect this statement@xcite ) .    according to the analysis in @xcite",
    ", we now develop the disk configuration around a given value of the radial coordinate @xmath55 , limiting our attention to a narrow enough interval to express the local angular velocity field in the form @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",
    "we approximate the dipole surface function , at @xmath55 , as @xmath58 .",
    "we drop the relic @xmath1-dependence in view of the thin nature of the disk .    in",
    "what follows , the analysis is performed by addressing the drift ordering approximation that fixes the dominant character of the second spatial derivatives of @xmath59 . in particular , the profile of the disk , so outlined , will include viscous features , as in @xcite , but making account for the crystalline structure derived in @xcite . indeed , reconciling the accretion feature of the disk with the plasma effects , as described in a bidimensional mhd approach , we will need a significant deviation from the standard mechanism of angular momentum transfer , in the sense that the azimuthal equation holds at the level of electromagnetic back - reaction only .",
    "in order to fix the profile of the disk around the configuration at @xmath55 , we have to provide the equations governing the radial , the vertical and the tangential equilibrium in the presence of the toroidal currents .",
    "the radial and the vertical configurations are not significantly affected by the viscosity , since its presence mainly concerns the differential rotation of the disk@xcite .",
    "therefore , these systems stand in the same form as in @xcite , while the implications due to a non - zero viscous stress are summarised by the azimuthal equilibrium .",
    "in order to cast the whole system , we split the energy density and the pressure in the form @xmath60 where the barred quantities are the contributions existing in absence of the toroidal currents , while the terms denoted with a hat are induced by such an electromagnetic reaction . according to the framework we outlined",
    ", the vertical equilibrium is governed by the two relations @xmath61 the radial equation underlying the equilibrium of the rotating layers of the disk , takes the form @xmath62 + \\frac{1}{4\\pi r_0 ^ 2}\\partial_r\\psi _ 1 \\partial^2_z\\psi_1\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the azimuthal equation exactly reads @xmath63   \\ , .",

    "putting together all these statements , the tangential equation rewrites @xmath72 \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since we have @xmath73 , the first term on the right - hand - side is negligible in comparison to the term containing second derivatives .",
    "furthermore , the request @xmath74 implies that @xmath75 , ensuring that also the quadratic terms in the derivatives of @xmath18 are much smaller than the remaining ones .",
    "therefore the form taken by the azimuthal equation for the steady state of the disk reads as @xmath76 \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this equation provides a differential relation between the flux surface @xmath18 and the function @xmath77 characterising the radial and vertical matter fluxes .",
    "let us analyse the compatibility between the radial and the azimuthal equations , in the limit when the induced @xmath1-field @xmath78 is much smaller than the source one @xmath79 , i.e. @xmath80 where the magnetic surface @xmath18 admits the explicit dependence @xmath81 here , we set @xmath82 , with @xmath83 being the alfvn velocity in the plasma .",
    "furthermore , @xmath84 denotes a narrow interval for the localisation of the @xmath1-dependence . under these hypotheses ,",
    "the radial equation rewrites @xmath85 at lowest orders in @xmath1 , we take the following expansion @xmath86 , @xmath87 being of the same order of magnitude of @xmath88 . in this limit , the radial equation admits the solution discussed in @xcite which oscillates as a sin function along the radial direction , while it exponentially decays in @xmath89 along the vertical configuration , i. e. @xmath18 reads as @xmath90 \\exp \\ { -\\frac{k_0z^2}{h_n}\\ } \\ , , \\label{sollineq}\\ ] ] where we set @xmath91 and we obtained the identification @xmath92 .",
    "such a structure is the linear feature of the crystalline morphology induced in the disk by the toroidal currents .    in the approximation",
    "where @xmath93 , we can require that the contribution due to the currents on the viscosity coefficient be sufficiently small to neglect the term in @xmath94 of ( [ azeqfin ] ) , i. e. by virtue of the inequality @xmath95 thus , the final form we address for the azimuthal equation is as follows @xmath96 we use this equation to complete the configuration scheme of our thin disk equilibrium . under the same conditions , fixed above for the linear regime , the azimuthal equation ( [ azeqfin ] )",
    "is restated as follows @xmath97 let us now assume that the term containing the derivative @xmath98 be negligible ( this is natural because it is multiplied by the small @xmath99-component of the magnetic field ) and then divide the equation by @xmath100 . observing that @xmath101 ( where @xmath102 ) , we rewrite ( [ azeqfinlin ] ) as follows @xmath103 comparing the equation above with ( [ ffpsix ] ) , we arrive to the relation @xmath104 in which we made use of the definition of the dimensionless function @xmath105 . comparing the two equations",
    ", we neglected the factor @xmath106 with respect to the @xmath1-dependence of @xmath18 , because @xmath107 , i.e. @xmath108 .    such an accreting profile provides a net increasing of the disk mass , according to the relation @xmath109 where we made use of the dipole - like expression for @xmath15 and we extended the integration over the vertical coordinate up to infinity .",
    "it is worth noting that , despite the radial velocity oscillates , the radial matter flux is , on average , an in - falling one .",
    "in fact , averaging the expression above between two nodes around @xmath55 , we get @xmath110 equation ( [ v - r ] ) can be easily solved for @xmath28 in agreement with the adopted approximation of neglecting the term containing @xmath98 , as follows @xmath111 hence we get the vertical velocity in the form @xmath112 we see that , in the linear approximation , the azimuthal equation ensures the existence of a non - zero accretion rate , which is modulated by the oscillating profile of the disk configuration .",
    "despite we have properly argued that the radial and vertical components of the fluid velocity are significantly smaller than the @xmath19-component of the velocity , nevertheless , the mhd electron force balance , restated here @xmath113 requires @xmath114 , because of @xmath115 , by virtue of the axial symmetry .",
    "for instance , this feature arises naturally if the corotation theorem is addressed .",
    "more simply , this request comes out from the independence of @xmath19 characterising the electrostatic potential .",
    "thus , on the left - hand side of equation ( [ efb ] ) an additional term has to appear in order to save the model consistence . in the limit of the linear theory ,",
    "the most natural term to be included in the analysis , preserving the mhd scenario we addressed , is a weak collisional effect , as phenomenologically described by a non - zero constant nernst coefficient .",
    "to introduce this hypothesis we need to give up the idea , pursued above , that the plasma in the disk be perfectly isothermal .",
    "thus , we now introduce temperature gradients@xcite in the spirit that they do not affect significantly the three configuration equations developed in the previous sections .",
    "we discuss only the implications for the electron force balance when a nernst coefficient is present and then we fix the restriction on the model parameters to get full consistence .    according to this idea",
    ", we split the temperature as @xmath116 , with @xmath117 and @xmath118 . in the presence of a non - zero nernst coefficient @xmath119 , the equation ( [ efb ] )",
    "takes the form @xmath120 assuming that the gradients of the temperature are negligible in the radial and vertical component of this equation , its @xmath19-component provides @xmath121 we now have to observe that the temperature of the plasma in the static mhd framework , must obey the equation @xmath122 expressing the gradients of the temperature by the relation ( [ solefb ] ) , the equation above takes the form @xmath123 it is easy to see that this equation is automatically satisfied in the linear regime , by virtue of the expressions for the radial and vertical velocity ( [ v - r ] ) and ( [ v - z ] ) respectively .",
    "the complete consistence of our linear model is then guaranteed by requiring that the radial temperature gradient be negligible in the corresponding configuration equation .",
    "such gradients arise in the radial equation from the spatial variation of the pressure @xmath124 ( from which we get @xmath125",
    ". the condition for the negligibility of this term , can be stated , by virtue of equations ( [ v - r ] ) and ( [ solefb ] ) , in the form @xmath126 to get this result , we made account for the fact that obtaining equation ( [ ffpsix ] ) , we divided the original radial equation by the term @xmath127 . by making use of the expression ( [ formeta ] ) for @xmath128 , we can rewrite the condition above in terms of the alfvn and equatorial sound velocities as @xmath129 , with @xmath130 ( we approximated everywhere the sound velocity with its value on the equatorial plane and we have taken @xmath131 ) .",
    "furthermore we implicitly required that the radial variation of @xmath132 be smaller or , at most , equal to the term with the temperature gradient .",
    "finally , the vertical equation , in the linear approximation reads as @xmath133 which easily rewrites as an equation for @xmath132 , i. e. @xmath134 such an equation fixes the following form for the perturbed mass density @xmath135 , where the @xmath1-dependence comes from the ordinary differential equation @xmath136 having defined @xmath137 .",
    "the above equation , using the expression ( [ formeta ] ) for @xmath128 , can be rewritten in the dimensionless form @xmath138 @xmath139 where we defined @xmath140 , @xmath141 and erf is the error function : @xmath142erf@xmath143 .",
    "this equation admits the formal solution @xmath144 which is plotted in fig [ fig ] for several values of @xmath145 and @xmath146     for several values of @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "the figure outlines an increasing behaviour of the function @xmath147 , and a maximum sometimes arises in the range of validity for the linear approximation . ]",
    "we conclude this analysis , by stressing that , because of ( [ formeta ] ) , the expression ( [ v - r ] ) provides the following estimation for @xmath51 @xmath148 we see that the accretion velocity is few orders of magnitude less than the sound velocity on the equatorial plane . in this respect , we observe that the parameter @xmath71 can be taken in the range @xmath149 ,",
    "while the dimensionless term @xmath150 can be even much greater than unity and the linear approximation requires @xmath151 .    despite the picture we fixed above",
    "is well - grounded in the linear approximation , it is well - known that the nernst coefficient is obtained in a kinetic theory via an expansion in the inverse powers of the cyclotronic frequency and it corresponds to a first order approximation scheme .",
    "thus , this effect is , in principle , small and we can expect that it be the proper explanation to the accretion features of a crystalline disk , in the weak field limit only , i.e. we have to require @xmath152 , to ensure the model reliability .",
    "our analysis was devoted to a study reconciling the crystalline structure of the disk , as outlined in @xcite , with the existence of an azimuthal equilibrium configuration .",
    "in fact , the impossibility to neglect the radial component of matter velocity , requested by the notion of accretion , leads to include in the equilibrium problem the angular momentum transport across the disk and the unavoidable viscous features , associated to the differential rotation .",
    "the problem to get a self - consistent scheme , in which the electron force balance equation properly holds even along the azimuthal direction is then addressed .",
    "in fact , the appearance of the radial and vertical component of the matter velocity , together with the vanishing nature of the azimuthal electric field in an axisymmetric configuration , rise the question how to get a consistent equilibrium balancing the lorenz force along the toroidal symmetry .",
    "the proposal we investigate here concerns the role that the nernst coefficient can have in this perspective . in agreement with the idea that this is a low cyclotronic frequency effect , we treat only the linearised mhd configuration .",
    "the presence of such a collisional term allows to link the radial and vertical velocity components to the temperature gradients , as soon as the azimuthal electron force balance equation stands .",
    "the linear behaviour is completely self - consistent and the adiabatic equation for the plasma pressure is satisfied as a consequence of the incompressible nature of the linear mhd , out - coming in this axisymmetric scenario .",
    "finally we were able to establish the condition ensuring that the radial temperature gradient be negligible in the corresponding equilibrium , while the linear vertical equilibrium is solved exactly .",
    "the main issue of our analysis is that the radial velocity has an oscillating character , with an amplitude few orders of magnitude below the sound velocity .",
    "indeed , we deal with a non - zero accretion rate because the material outside @xmath55 is greater than the one inside ( we are estimating the matter density with its value at @xmath55 ) .",
    "such an oscillating profile is a direct consequence of the linear crystalline structure of the model .",
    "more than with a real matter in - fall , arising expectably in the non - linear regime , we get a matter flow which explains the formation of the ring configuration within the disk .",
    "however our goal opens interesting perspective on the understanding about the existence of a ring - like decomposition in presence of a mechanism of accretion , i.e. significantly non zero radial in - fall of the plasma .",
    "we would like to thank b. coppi for having attracted our attention on the relevance of the electron force balance in an accretion disk , f. zonca for the interesting discussion on plasma physics in axis - symmetric configuration , and a. corsi for her advices on the literature concerning accretion disk morphology ."
