    "in a superconductor , fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter above the transition temperature @xmath0 affect various properties such as the magnetic susceptibility and transport coefficients .",
    "the study of superconducting fluctuations has a long history ( for reviews , see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "more recently , interest in fluctuation phenomena was renewed with the discovery of high - temperature superconductors , where their short coherence lengths , high critical temperatures , and layered structures imply a large regime for the observation of fluctuations .",
    "@xcite    one experiment that has aroused particular interest recently is that of the nernst effect : a temperature gradient @xmath4 is applied in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath5 , and the electric field response ( in the absence of transport electric current ) is measured in the @xmath6 direction .",
    "below @xmath0 in the vortex state the nernst effect is large due to vortex motion , while in the normal state it is typically very small . in experiments in low temperature superconductors",
    "no sign of superconducting fluctuations was reported as the temperature was raised above @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite in contrast , several different experiments did observe the appearance of a fluctuation tail above the critical temperature in the nernst signal of the high - temperature superconductors  @xcite ( and also in the related ettinghausen effect  @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , the nernst effect above @xmath0 has attracted considerable attention with measurements showing a sizeable nernst signal well above @xmath0 , in particular in the underdoped regime .",
    "@xcite    while a nernst experiment is carried out under open circuit conditions , the transport coefficients which arise naturally in a theoretical description are those which relate the transport electric and heat currents to the electric field and temperature gradient , @xmath7 here , @xmath8 is the conductivity tensor , @xmath9 a tensor of thermal conductivity , and @xmath10 , @xmath11 the thermoelectric tensors ( which obey the onsager relations , @xmath12 ) . applying the open circuit condition to eq .",
    "( [ response - coefficients ] ) , the nernst coefficient is expressed in terms of the conductivity and thermoelectric tensors , @xmath13 the transverse thermoelectric response @xmath1 , the quantity on which this paper is focused , is of primary interest for understanding the effect of superconducting fluctuations on the nernst signal ( as discussed below ) .    in a recent paper , ussishkin , sondhi , and huse discussed the contribution of superconducting fluctuations to the thermoelectric and thermal conductivity tensors using a stochastic time - dependent ginzburg - landau equation ( tdgl ) in the limit of gaussian fluctuations .",
    "@xcite in this paper we revisit the calculation of the transverse thermoelectric response @xmath1 using a diagrammatic calculation within bcs theory .",
    "the details of this calculation are presented in subsequent sections . in the remainder of this section we present and discuss the results of this paper .",
    "we calculate @xmath1 above the critical temperature @xmath0 , to linear order in the magnetic field @xmath14 , and to leading order in @xmath15 .",
    "we find that , in two and three dimensions , the contribution of superconducting fluctuations to the transverse thermoelectric response is @xmath16 here , @xmath17 is the magnetic length , and @xmath18 is the coherence length of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "it is well known ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) that superconducting fluctuations enhance the conductivity above @xmath0 due to both the aslamazov - larkin  @xcite and the maki - thompson  @xcite contributions ( there are also density of states terms , which are less important for the conductivity ) .",
    "a similar identification of the microscopic contributions applies to other transport coefficients . in the case of the transverse thermoelectric response , as the superscript in eq .",
    "( [ alpha - xy - result ] ) suggests , we find that the leading order contribution to @xmath1 is due to the aslamazov - larkin diagrams alone .",
    "the contribution of the maki - thompson and density of states diagrams is less divergent as @xmath3 .    physically , the aslamazov - larkin diagrams correspond to the contribution of thermal fluctuations of the order parameter .",
    "their contribution to @xmath1 may be viewed either as the transport heat current carried by such fluctuations when they respond to an electric field , or as the transport electric current carried by the fluctuations as they respond to a temperature gradient ( all in the presence of the magnetic field ) .",
    "the same physics is identically described by the gaussian approximation to a stochastic tdgl .",
    "( we will have more to remark on the correspondence between the two approaches in subsequent sections . )",
    "indeed , the result obtained in this paper , eq .  ( [ alpha - xy - result ] ) ,",
    "is identical to the result obtained in the gaussian approximation to the stochastic tdgl in ref .  .",
    "before discussing the experimental situation , we comment on two assumptions made in this paper .",
    "first , we assume that the order parameter has @xmath19-wave symmetry . in the context of the high - temperature superconductors it is of interest to consider also the case of @xmath20-wave symmetry in this approach .",
    "we note here that this will not affect the conclusions of this paper : the results of the stochastic tdgl would still correspond to the aslamazov - larkin contribution ; and the arguments showing that maki - thompson and density of states terms are less divergent remain valid in this case as well .",
    "@xcite ( we do not consider here the related issue , of whether nodal quasiparticles , which appear when the temperature is lowered and the condensate is formed , contribute to @xmath1 . )",
    "second , we assume particle - hole symmetry ( i.e. , neglecting any contributions which arise due to asymmetry around the fermi surface in properties such as the density of states ) . for quantities that do not vanish in this limit this is a very good approximation for a bcs superconductor .",
    "( on the other hand , particle - hole symmetry implies that @xmath21 , and therefore in calculating these transport coefficients it is necessary to break this symmetry . )",
    "we note that the contribution of the normal metallic state to @xmath1 also vanishes in this limit .",
    "however , this is not required by symmetry , and indeed is no longer the case once superconductivity is taken into account .",
    "we now return to the discussion of the nernst coefficient @xmath22 . as noted in eq .",
    "( [ nernst ] ) , @xmath22 is related to both the conductivity and thermoelectric tensors .",
    "however , the main effect of superconducting fluctuations on the nernst signal above @xmath0 is due to @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , the contribution of fluctuations to the second term in the numerator of eq .",
    "( [ nernst ] ) is small due to considerations of particle - hole symmetry .",
    "moreover , not too close to @xmath0 the conductivity is dominated by the normal state contribution .",
    "it follows that the main contribution of superconducting fluctuations to the nernst signal ( to linear order in @xmath23 ) is @xmath24 , with @xmath25 being the normal state contribution .    since the result for @xmath26 , eq .",
    "( [ alpha - xy - result ] ) , depends only on the coherence length @xmath27 , and in a simple manner , comparison with experiment should apparently be straightforward . in ref .",
    ", such a comparison for a high - temperature superconductor was presented . on the other hand , in low - temperature superconductors ,",
    "for which bcs theory is certainly applicable , the appearance of the fluctuation tail in the nernst signal was not previously reported to the best of our knowledge .",
    "@xcite the reason for this is that low - temperature superconductors are typically also good conductors in the normal state .",
    "consequently @xmath28 , the contribution of superconducting fluctuations to the nernst signal , is strongly suppressed in bulk low - temperature superconductors .",
    "the situation can be improved considerably by looking at a thin film , which is effectively a two dimensional superconductor if the coherence length is larger than the film thickness .",
    "first , the fluctuation tail of @xmath1 is enhanced by going to lower dimensionality , as is evident in eq .",
    "( [ alpha - xy - result ] ) . [ the result for two dimensions in eq .",
    "( [ alpha - xy - result ] ) is to be divided by the film thickness to obtain the result for a thin film . ]",
    "second , such films may have a significantly lower normal state conductivity . taken together",
    ", these effects may considerably enhance the contribution of fluctuations to the nernst signal .",
    "a similar situation may occur in a layered structure with weak coupling between the layers and with a low normal - state conductivity , as is the case for the high - temperature superconductors .",

    "an important aspect of the calculation of the transverse thermoelectric response , discussed in detail by cooper , halperin , and ruzin ,  @xcite is the need to account for _ bulk magnetization currents_. this issue arises because the microscopic electric and heat currents , as calculated by the kubo formula , are composed of transport and magnetization currents , @xmath41 the magnetization currents are currents that circulate in the sample and do not contribute to the net currents which are measured in a transport experiment . on the other hand",
    ", they do contribute to the total microscopic currents , and it is thus necessary to subtract them from the total currents to obtain the transport current response . in the presence of an applied electric field , it was shown in ref .   that the magnetization current is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the equilibrium magnetization ( in the absence of the electric field ) .",

    "the latter is given in this case by  @xcite @xmath47 in ref .",
    "the total heat current response to an electric field and the total current response to a temperature gradient were calculated using the stochastic tdgl . the apparent discrepancy between the results for the total currents and the onsager relations",
    "was invoked to demonstrate the need of subtracting out the magnetization currents .",
    "in contrast , in the linear response formalism the calculation for the electric current yields its response to a `` gravitational field '' gradient , and this apparent discrepancy does not arise .",
    "the magnetization currents ( and the total currents ) trivially obey the same onsager relations obeyed by the transport currents .",

    "@xcite moreover , for these two diagrams to diverge as the aslamazov - larkin diagram , the expansion in external wavevector @xmath149 and external frequency @xmath150 should give powers of @xmath165 and @xmath162 respectively , as it does for the aslamazov - larkin diagram . the expansion in @xmath150",

    "however , the important point in this analysis is that in diagrams ( d ) and ( e ) the expansion in external momentum @xmath149 does not gain a power of @xmath165 , but instead accounts for @xmath163 in the power counting .",
    "the reason for this is that the external momentum , which flows from the @xmath169 vertex to the @xmath170 vertex , does not flow through the fluctuation propagators of the diagram .",

    "[ sec - j ] , we verify this correspondence also for thermal transport .",
    "there are two directions in which to extend the calculation beyond this approximation : by considering the additional microscopic contributions ( as we did in this paper ) , or by going beyond the gaussian approximation in the stochastic tdgl ( cf.ref .  ) .",
    "we would like to emphasize that these approaches are of a very different nature , and their regime of validity is also different .    the stochastic tdgl is traditionally understood as the model for the critical dynamics of a superconductor ( model a in the classification of hohenberg and halperin  @xcite ) .",
    "as such , the tdgl should give the relevant contribution as the temperature approaches @xmath0 in the critical regime ( which for low - temperature superconductors is very narrow , as expressed by the ginzburg criterion  @xcite ) .",
    "additional microscopic terms become irrelevant in this regime .    on the other hand , further away from @xmath0 in the region where the microscopic calculation is valid , additional microscopic contributions may arise ( as they do for the conductivity ) . to reiterate , for the transverse thermoelectric response",
    "we find that they are less divergent then the aslamazov - larkin contribution as @xmath3 .",
    "not investigated here is the possibility that these normal state corrections vanish in the case of particle - hole symmetry , as does the drude result for @xmath1 ( to emphasize , a result not required by symmetry ) .    to connect the microscopic approach with the critical dynamics",
    ", one may expect that in the microscopic approximation as the temperature is lowered , the maki - thompson and density of states terms would become less important as the behavior becomes governed by the stochastic tdgl . for @xmath1",
    "this clearly occurs in the microscopic calculation .",
    "@xcite in conclusion , this work provides further justification for using the tdgl also as the temperature increases away from @xmath0 into the gaussian regime ( which is the approach taken in ref .  ) .",
    "interest in the nernst signal has grown recently due to the measurements in high - temperature superconductors , where the fluctuations signal can be observed well above @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , the contribution of superconducting fluctuations to the nernst signal is yet to be observed in a low - temperature superconductor , for which the bcs microscopics considered in this paper are applicable . as discussed in the introduction , we expect the fluctuation tail to be observable in the nernst signal of a suitably chosen superconducting thin film .",
