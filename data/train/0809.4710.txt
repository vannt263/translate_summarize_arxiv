    "two - leg transformation was first introduced by fisher@xcite in the 1950 s decade , after which this transformation was used widely for one - dimensional decorated models , such as discussed recently for the tetramer ising - heisenberg bond - alternating chain as a model system for cu(3-chloropyridine)@xmath2(n@xmath3)@xmath2 in reference @xcite .",
    "another decorated model has also been considered recently@xcite , one that can be applied even for two - dimensional decorated ising models@xcite or higher dimensions .",
    "the ising models with multi - spin interactions have been extensively investigated both theoretically and experimentally . in this sense , we present a review of the start - triangle transformation@xcite .",
    "this kind of transformation also was discussed in detail by syozi@xcite .",
    "this transformation is widely used for two - dimensional models , the most well known of these being the ising kagom lattice@xcite , the honeycomb lattice@xcite , and other two - dimensional models like ising model on pentagonal lattice@xcite .",
    "another illustration of the application of this transformation was performed for the ising - heisenberg diamond chain@xcite .",
    "this transformation can also be applied to higher dimension decorated lattice such as , two - dimensional decorated ising - heisenberg models@xcite and two - dimensional doubly decorated ising - heisenberg models@xcite .",
    "recently several real systems motivate to investigate in this kinds of transformation , such as the discovered two - dimensional magnetic materials @xmath4 ( cpa=2-carboxypentonic acid ; x = f , cl , br ) where the @xmath5 spins stands on the triangular kagom lattice@xcite with heisenberg interaction type .",

    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we start with a review of star - triangle transformation@xcite where we comment their possible extension , afterwards we extend it formally to the general case of the @xmath6-leg spin-1/2 system . in section 3",
    "we present the transformation for the general case of the @xmath6-leg spin-@xmath1 , using matrix formulation . in section 4",
    "we discuss the correlation function for the general case of the @xmath6-leg spin-@xmath1 system also using the matrix formulation . in section 5 , this transformation is applied to the mixed spin-(1/2,@xmath1 ) of square ising lattice with only nearest interaction , spite this model can not be mapped into exactly solvable model , we even could discuss their critical point behavior . using a double transformation we study the spin-@xmath1 square lattice with nearest and next - nearest interaction , furthermore the effective hamiltonian also include combinations of three - body and four - body interactions .",
    "finally in section 6 we present our conclusion .",
    "the star - ising model with an _ arbitrary decorated spin _ @xmath7 , and the spin-1/2 of legs @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 is presented in the figure 1 . conveniently the hamiltonian will be defined from now in units of @xmath11 , being @xmath12 the boltzmann constant and @xmath13 the absolute temperature . therefore the hamiltonian is given by    @xmath14    here the parameter @xmath15 represents the magnetic field acting on spin @xmath7 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the exchange parameter between @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively .",
    "the parameters of the three - spin interaction are @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 which corresponds to the three spins products @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively .",
    "finally the interaction parameter",
    "@xmath25 corresponds to the four - body interaction @xmath26 .",
    "it is important to notice that the first fourth terms of the hamiltonian already was considered early by fisher@xcite .    now",
    "the hamiltonian of the triangle - ising model represented in fig.[fig_2 ] ( right ) can also be expressed , in a very general way , as follow @xmath27 where @xmath28 correspond to the effective parameter corresponding to a constant energy , the coefficients of @xmath29 ( with @xmath30 ) represents the effective parameter of a magnetic field , the coefficients of @xmath31 ( with @xmath32 ) are the standard bilinear coupling effective parameter , and the coefficient of @xmath33 represent the effective three - linear interaction .",
    "besides adding a magnetic field parameter to the standard star - triangle transformation proposed by fisher@xcite , we also included the three - linear parameter , in order to solve the algebraic system equation consistently .",
    "we can verify that there are eight equations and eight parameters to be obtained .",
    "carrying out a partial trace over the variable of the decorating system , it is reduced to an effective partition function with spin-1/2 ising model .",
    "therefore we write down the partition function for a given decorated system @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the number of decorations of the lattice . considering a partial summation on decorated particles ( @xmath7 ) ,",
    "we have the following amount , which we will call the associated boltzmann weight @xmath36    on the other hand the boltzmann factor @xmath37 in the transformed ( undecorated ) hamiltonian , becomes @xmath38 the transformation of the parameter of @xmath39 into a function of @xmath40 is obtained , relating the @xmath41 .",
    "therefore from eqs . and , we get the solution of the new parameters as a function of the decorated hamiltonian parameters , given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 with @xmath44 .    if we consider the _ arbitrary decorated spin _ @xmath7 as a simple spin-1/2 , this transformation is known as duality of the star - triangle relation@xcite and is useful to solve other spin models such as kagom like models .",
    "the solution showed in eq .",
    "corresponds to the eight solutions .",
    "a particular case of this solution becomes the solution obtained by fisher@xcite , when we consider @xmath45 and @xmath46 , leaving thus only four free parameters to be determined instead of eight .",
    "this particular solution is widely applied to a large variety of two dimensional lattice . in a recent paper , lackov _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite discussed an exact results of a mixed spin-1/2 and spin-1 transverse ising model with two- and four - spin interactions and crystal field on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the transformation of the decorated model presented by fisher@xcite could also be extended to the _ cross - square _ transformation as considered recently by savvidy@xcite , to study the systems with exponentially degenerated vacuum state .",
    "a particular case of this transformation was discussed in reference @xcite , with the bilinear and the four - linear terms as the non - null parameters , thus maintaining only three free parameters in the hamiltonian , which is necessary to study the gonihedric model@xcite .    motivated by the previous result",
    ", we can extended the formulation to a general case , where we consider @xmath6 particles interacting with a central _ spin _ @xmath7 . this kind of model can be used to study two or three dimensional lattices with high order coordination number .",
    "the hamiltonian of the decorated model with non - linear interaction and central spin @xmath7 can be expressed as        @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the parameter interaction of @xmath49 with sub - indexes @xmath50 .",
    "we denote the set @xmath51 , similarly by @xmath52 , whereas the super indexes are related to the number of legs or coordination number of decorated spin .",
    "on the other hand , the undecorated hamiltonian into which the decorated hamiltonian will be transformed , is given by @xmath53 the transformation of the parameters @xmath54 as a function of @xmath48 are obtained in a similar way as in the previous case .",
    "writing the associated boltzmann weight , as a trace over the spin-@xmath7 of the decorated system , @xmath55    on the other hand the boltzmann weight function @xmath56 , for the transformed hamiltonian can be expressed as @xmath57 assuming that @xmath58 and eq .",
    "are known , we substitute them in eq . , getting the solution of the unknown parameters which reads as @xmath59 rewritten the eq .",
    "a little different , we have @xmath60 where the function @xmath61 depends only of spins @xmath29 , @xmath62 with @xmath43 and @xmath63 . eq",
    ". corresponds to @xmath64 solutions of the unknown parameters @xmath54 .",
    "let us consider a special case as an example , without losing its general properties , suppose we consider the central spin @xmath65 , then the eq .",
    "is reduced to @xmath66",
    "one interesting extension considered here is the higher spins of decorated models , then for this purpose we first consider the two - leg spin-1 model , where we introduce a matrix formalism to simplify our notation .",
    "after that we will discuss the fully general spin-@xmath67 m - leg star - polygon transformation .      in this section",
    "we discuss the spin-1 case .",
    "recently similar situation was discussed by fireman _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite where they consider the ising model with bi - linear , bi - quadratic , single ion anisotropy and zeeman interaction , which was mapped into an effective blume emery griffiths ( beg ) model@xcite . extending to the spin-1 model ,",
    "it is possible to write the hamiltonian according to the definition in eq .",
    ", @xmath68 where @xmath69 corresponds to interaction parameter , here @xmath70 and @xmath71 represents the spin-1 , whereas @xmath7 could be any mechanical system .",

    ", which would give us , @xmath72 with @xmath73 being the interaction parameters of the transformed system . considering a partial summation of the partition function where involves the summation ( trace ) on spin @xmath7 , we obtain as before the so called associated boltzmann weight , given by , @xmath74 to solve the unknown parameter we introduce the matrix formalism which is an appropriate representation to express these equations in terms of the known parameters . using the matrix notation we write the eq .",

    "we find the parameters of effective hamiltonian as a function of the original decorated hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , we define the associated boltzmann weight function @xmath79 as @xmath80    to make a complete matrix representation , we define the following function @xmath81 .",
    "the function @xmath82 can be expressed as a vector @xmath83 . using the matrix notation and considering @xmath84",
    ", we have the following equation @xmath85 the solution of the equation above could be obtained by taking the inverse of the matrix @xmath86 , denoted from now on by @xmath87 , the solution is then expressed by @xmath88 but the @xmath89 can be written also as @xmath90 and its inverse becomes @xmath91 . in the present case the matrix @xmath92 and @xmath93 could be written explicitly as @xmath94 certainly it is simpler to evaluate the inverse of the reduced matrix @xmath92 instead of the large matrix @xmath89 .    as an example we can consider the non - uniform two - leg ising spin transformation with central spin @xmath95 , without losing any generality . for this particular case the eq",
    "will be expressed as @xmath96    we remark that this transformation is carried out for every unitary cell and can be applied to the one - dimensional @xcite , two - dimensional @xcite and other high dimensional spin lattices .      for a higher spin",
    "the hamiltonian can be written in a general way using the previous matrix notation @xmath97 where the dimension of the matrix @xmath98 is @xmath99 , meanwhile , the dimension of the matrix @xmath100 is @xmath101 .",
    "we can see that the matrix @xmath100 is a vandermonde matrix with _ equidistant nodes _ @xmath0 $ ] , and the elements of the nodes are @xmath102 which corresponds only to the magnetic moments of the spin-@xmath67 .",
    "the elements can be appropriately expressed as @xmath103 , with @xmath104 .",
    "the explicit representation of the vandermonde matrix is given by @xmath105    using he matrix notation , the function @xmath106 is defined in a similar way as was defined in eq .",
    ", therefore we have a vector function given by    @xmath107    the effective hamiltonian of the undecorated system also can be written in analogy to eq .. thus we have @xmath108    the hamiltonian considered in eq . , can contain at most @xmath109 parameters .",
    "this also means that the dimension of the vectors @xmath77 and @xmath83 is @xmath109 . taking the inverse of the matrix @xmath98 we are able to express the new parameters as a function of the known parameters defined by eq .",

    "this section presents the general extension for the @xmath6-leg star - polygon transformation of decorated ising spin model .",
    "based on the previous results , the considered hamiltonian will be written as follows @xmath118 where @xmath119 corresponds to an arbitrary spin for each leg . assuming that we have @xmath6 legs of the star or @xmath6 edge of the polygon with @xmath7 being the central spin , then the dimension of the matrix @xmath120 is @xmath121 .",

    "the corresponding boltzmann weigth could be written as follow    @xmath131    the explicit form of matrix @xmath132 and its respective inverse is presented in appendix a , up to spin-3 . for an arbitrary spin - s , the matrix @xmath132 is given by eq . and",
    "the elements of the matrix inverse are given by the eq ..",
    "the correlation function in the transformed hamiltonian involving the central spin @xmath7 can be obtained in a very similar way such as initially proposed by fisher@xcite . here",
    "we present a very general extension to obtain the correlation function , using the correlation function of effective systems ( undecorated systems ) .",
    "the correlation function involving spins such as @xmath133 , with @xmath134 any arbitrary spin of system , can be written as @xmath135 where the trace is performed over all @xmath7 and @xmath136 , whereas @xmath137 is the partition function for the m - leg ising model .",
    "for simplicity , we consider , as before the hamiltonian in units of @xmath138 .",
    "the partial summation over @xmath7 can be expressed as follows @xmath139    on the other hand we want to write the correlation function as a function of all spins of the @xmath6-leg lattice ; for that purpose , we can try to represent the @xmath140 as a linear combination of @xmath141 , which reads as @xmath142 where @xmath143 are coefficients to be determined .",
    "matrix notation is usually very convenient , as was shown in the previous section .",

    "several approximation methods , such as the mean - field - theory@xcite , the bethe approximation@xcite , the correlated effective field theory@xcite , the renormalization group@xcite , the series expansion methods@xcite , the monte carlo methods@xcite and the cluster variation methods are used to investigate this interesting lattice .",
    "however , an exact solution has been obtained only in a very limited cases , mainly in the honeycomb lattices@xcite . some exact results with restricted parameters has been investigated by mi and yang@xcite using a non - one - to - one transformation@xcite .    as an example we apply the transformation method presented in the previous section to a lattice with mixed spin-1/2 and spin-@xmath1 .",

    "we point out that the matrix method calculation of the parameters becomes relevant for higer spin values , the method used in this case simplify effectively very tedious calulations .",
    "for example , for spin-1 the calculation of the interaction parameters , without using the matrix method , even could be obtained using the transformation of reference @xcite .",
