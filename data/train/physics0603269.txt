    "the majority of experiments based on the use of x - rays are carried out at synchrotron radiation facilities , as very high brilliance is achievable by means of undulator devices installed in storage rings .",
    "guiding the photons from the exit of an undulator to the specimen position requires the development of optical beamlines whose main task is to re - image the undulator source to any plane of interest . to deal with the image formation problem",
    ", one should account for the fact that synchrotron radiation constitutes a random stochastic process .",
    "in fact , the shot noise in the electron beam causes fluctuations of the electron beam current density .",
    "these fluctuations are random both in space and time . as a result",
    ", the radiation field produced by the electron beam can be described in terms of a phasor with random amplitudes and phases and , in all generality , the laws of statistical optics must be applied to solve the image formation problem . in this paper",
    "we study the image formation problem with undulator radiation beams based on statistical optics . in this framework , the basic quantity characterizing synchrotron radiation sources is the second order correlation function of the fields at two observation points on a given transverse plane identified by the coordinate @xmath3 along the optical beamline .",
    "once such a plane is fixed , the two points , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , are fully characterized by their transverse coordinates @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively .",
    "our presentation will be given in the frequency domain .",
    "due to the limited temporal resolution of detectors in synchrotron radiation experiments , the analysis in frequency domain is much more natural than that in the time domain . as a consequence of this choice , and without restrictive assumptions on the system , we study the spatial correlation between fourier transforms of the electric fieldsince our analysis deals with the electric field in frequency domain , we will sometimes refer to the `` fourier transform of the electric field '' simply as `` the field '' , when this does not generate confusion .",
    "] at a fixed frequency @xmath8 , that is the cross - spectral density    @xmath9    in eq .",
    "( [ g12 ] ) @xmath10 is the complex amplitude of the fourier transform of a given cartesian component of the electric field at the space - frequency point @xmath11 , the asterisk denotes complex conjugation , and brackets @xmath12 indicate an ensemble average over electron bunches .",
    "since we study an ultra - relativistic system , the paraxial approximation can always be enforced so that , here , the electric field is understood to obey the paraxial wave equation @xcite .",
    "the cross - spectral density carries all information about the transverse characteristics of undulator radiation .",
    "a fully general study of the cross - spectral density is not a trivial one .",
    "difficulties arise when one tries to include simultaneously the effect of intrinsic divergence of the radiation , due to the presence of the undulator , of the electron beam size and of the electron beam divergence . in @xcite",
    "a technique was described , based on statistical optics , to calculate the cross - spectral density from undulator sources in the most general case , at any position after the undulator but still without optical elements ( i.e. in free space ) .",
    "although self - contained , the present study relies on that work .",
    "expressions from @xcite will be taken as a starting point to proceed along the optical beamline towards the specimen position .    in general ,",
    "as we will see , undulator radiation can be thought as originating from an equivalent source localized on a transverse plane at a given longitudinal position . by definition ,",
    "such source has the following property : it produces a field which coincides with that from the undulator at any distance from the exit of the undulator . in particular",
    ", we localize the equivalent source in the center of the undulator , that will be conventionally taken as the beamline origin @xmath13 .",
    "since in this case the equivalent source does not reproduce the real electromagnetic field distribution in the center of the undulator , we refer to it as _ virtual source_. further on , throughout this paper we assume that the beta functions of the electron beam have their minimal value in the center of the undulator . by this ,",
    "as we will see , the virtual source exhibits particular properties which simplify our treatment . once the concept of virtual source is introduced , the problem of describing radiation characteristics at a certain observation plane after a given optical element is twofold .",
    "first , one has to characterize the cross - spectral density at the virtual source and , second , one has to propagate the cross - spectral density along the optical beamline to the observation plane .",
    "let us first consider the problem of characterizing the source .",
    "an important simplified model which admits an analytical description without loss of essential information about the source features is obtained by letting both horizontal and vertical electron beam emittances be much larger than the radiation wavelength ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "this is a good assumption for second generation synchrotron radiation sources .",
    "the kind of virtual source obtained for @xmath14 belongs to the wider class of quasi - homogeneous ones .",
    "these are characterized by the fact that the cross - spectral density at the virtual source plane ( i.e. at @xmath13 ) can be written as :    @xmath15    where    @xmath16    is the field intensity distribution and @xmath17 is the spectral degree of coherence ( normalized , by definition , so that @xmath18 ) . the definition of quasi - homogeneity amounts to a factorization of the cross - spectral density as the product of the field intensity distribution and the spectral degree of coherence , which contains information about the spatial correlation .",
    "a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for such factorization to be possible follows : _ ( a ) _",
    "the radiation intensity at the virtual source varies very slowly with the position across the source on the scale of the field correlation length and _ ( b ) _ the spectral degree of coherence depends on the positions across the source only through the difference @xmath19 .",
    "there are situations when the statistical optics description is not the only one possible .",
    "the asymptotic limit for large electron beam emittances ( @xmath14 ) is one of these . in this limit ,",
    "the statistical optics description of the source coincides with the geometrical optics ( or hamiltonian ) description of the source , where a photon - beam phase space is defined and can be described in terms of rays specified by position - angle coordinates . in the geometrical optics approach , based on the uncertainty principle , only the radiation originating by a photon - beam phase space area of order @xmath20 ^ 2 $ ] is spatially coherent .",
    "when the emittance is much larger than the wavelength , @xmath21 , the divergence of the electron beam is much larger than the diffraction angle of undulator radiation , and the transverse size of the electron beam is much larger than the diffraction size of undulator radiation . as a result one",
    "can completely neglect diffraction effects , and the geometrical optics approach can always be applied .",
    "since geometrical optics describes a limiting situation of statistical optics there must be a relation between the fundamental geometrical optics quantity , the phase space distribution , and the fundamental statistical optics quantity , the cross - spectral density .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the radiant intensity of the field generated in free space by a quasi - homogeneous source in the direction of a unit vector @xmath22 can be expressed as    @xmath23    @xmath24 being the two - dimensional spatial fourier transform of the degree of transverse coherence @xmath17 :    @xmath25 d{\\vec{\\rho'}}~.\\label{ftran}\\ ] ]    the expression for the phase space distribution is given by the product of the intensity distribution of the source and the radiant intensity    @xmath26    where the variables @xmath27 characterize a ray in phase space . a comparison between eq .",
    "( [ phsp ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ introh ] ) shows that cross - spectral density and phase space distribution contain the same information in the limiting case @xmath14 .",
    "in other words , if a source has a large angular divergence ( compared with the diffraction angle ) and a large transverse size ( compared with the diffraction size ) , one can completely neglect diffraction effects and treat the problem of the characterization of the source by means of geometrical optics condition @xmath28 is sufficient , but not necessary . in general , we can not say that geometrical optics is never applicable for electron beam emittances smaller than the radiation wavelength @xmath29 .",
    "we will treat this subject in a more extensive fashion in section [ sub : imfoge ] .",
    "there we will see that there are situations when geometrical optics can be applied to describe the ( virtual ) source even when the electron beam emittance is smaller than @xmath29 .",
    "we will find that a sufficient ( less restrictive , but still not necessary ) condition for the applicability of geometrical optics to the description of a given undulator source is that such source can be characterized in terms of a quasi - homogeneous virtual source .",
    "moreover , as it will also be discussed in section [ sub : imfoge ] , our comparison of the emittance with the radiation wavelength is done under the assumption that the electron beam beta function is comparable with the radiation formation length at wavelength @xmath29 .",
    "this is often , but not always , the case for undulator sources , since the radiation formation length is the undulator length , which is at least a few meters .",
    "however , it is not the case for bending magnet radiation . ] .    despite the previous discussion , the possibilities of using geometrical optics to describe undulator sources are quite limited in many realistic situations .",
    "applications of synchrotron radiation make use of a very wide range of wavelengths which span over four order of magnitude , from @xmath30 to @xmath31 . for third generation light sources , either planned or in operation ,",
    "the horizontal electron beam emittance @xmath32 is of order of @xmath33 nm . the vertical emittance is given by @xmath34 , @xmath35 being the so called coupling factor .",
    "typical values of @xmath35 for third generation light sources are of order @xmath36 , corresponding to vertical emittances of order @xmath37 .",
    "these values are always near or within the diffraction limit for wavelength ranges up to the hard x - rays in the vertical direction , and geometrical optics descriptions fail . in particular , in the vuv wavelength range ,",
    "both vertical and horizontal emittances are much smaller than the radiation wavelength ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "one recovers , then , the perfectly coherent situation when the source is diffraction limited in both horizontal and vertical directions .",
    "this is another situation when the statistical optics description is not the only one possible . in this case",
    ", deterministic wave optics may be used as well . as the wavelength becomes shorter , in the soft x - ray range , one obtains @xmath39 , but @xmath40 . at wavelengths of about @xmath41",
    "the vertical emittance reaches the same order of magnitude of the wavelength @xmath42 , while @xmath43 .",
    "finally , in the hard x - ray region , at a wavelength of about @xmath30 , both emittances are much larger than the wavelength ( @xmath14 ) , and geometrical optics can be used alongside statistical optics .",
    "it follows that , for third generation light sources , only the limiting cases for wavelengths around @xmath44 nm and @xmath45 can be treated , respectively , my means of wave optics or geometrical optics .",
    "the intermediate situation can be treated in a rigorous way only with the help of statistical optics , which includes both wave optics and geometrical optics as asymptotic cases .",
    "strictly related to the problem of source characterization , but separate from it , is the issue of propagating the photon beam through the optical beamline to the observation plane . in the case of quasi - homogeneous virtual sources ,",
    "if diffraction effects from the optical elements can be neglected , geometrical optics can be taken advantage of .",
    "the virtual source can be described in terms of phase space distribution , and interactions with optical media can be conveniently modelled in terms of symplectic transformations , very much like electron beams in storage rings optics .",
    "several computer codes ( e.g. shadow @xcite ) , usually referred to as ray - tracing codes , have been developed and are standard tools used to carry out geometrical optics - based calculations .",
    "however , this approach is not always possible as the virtual source may not be quasi - homogeneous or diffraction effects may not be neglected in the optical beamline .",
    "a rigorous analysis of the object - image coherence relationship is of fundamental importance in the context of several coherence - based techniques like fluctuation correlation dynamics , phase imaging , coherent x - ray diffraction and x - ray holography , whose development has been fostered by the high flux of coherent x - rays provided by state - of - the - art third generation facilities . it should be noted that , in the case of partially coherent wavefronts , even the calculation of the intensity distribution at the specimen position should involve statistical optics techniques .",
    "in fact , to obtain the intensity at the specimen position as some optical element is present one first needs to track the cross - spectral density through the beamline i.e. one needs to study the evolution of the partially coherent wavefront .",
    "computer codes have been written @xcite in order to deal with beamline design in the case of partially coherent radiation .",
    "these are devoted to the solution of the image formation problem starting from first principles .",
    "results may in fact be obtained using numerical techniques alone , starting from the lienard - wiechert expressions for the electromagnetic field and applying the definition of the field correlation function without any analytical manipulation . yet , a first - principle calculation of the field correlation function between two generic points or , in particular , calculation of the intensity at a single point involves very complicated and time - expensive numerical evaluations . to be specific , one needs to perform two integrations along the undulator device and four integrations over the electron - beam phase space distribution to solve the problem in free space .",
    "then , modelling the optical beamline as a single convergent lens , other four integrations are needed to characterize coherence properties on the image plane , for a total of ten integrations .",
    "the development of a universal code for any experimental setup is then likely to be problematic .",
    "a more conservative approach may suggest the use of computer codes based on some analytical manipulation of first principle equations suited for specific experimental setups . from this viewpoint our most general expressions may be used as reliable basis for the development of numerical methods . yet",
    ", computer codes can calculate properties for a given set of parameters , but can hardly improve physical understanding , which is particularly important in the stage of planning experiments .",
    "our theory will allow treatment and physical understanding of many asymptotes of the parameter space and their applicability region with the help of a consistent use of dimensional analysis . in the most general asymptotic cases treated here , this will allow to reduce first principle calculations ( i.e. ten - dimensional integrals ) to one - dimensional convolutions of analytical functions with universal functions specific for the undulator source case , and still to retain a certain degree of generality .",
    "it is also worth to underline that our asymptotic results may also be used as a benchmark for numerical methods .",
    "one of the main difficulties in applying a statistical optics approach to synchrotron radiation sources stems from the fact that statistical optics has principally developed in connection with problems involving thermal light .",
    "solutions to all these problems share approximations that allow major simplifications , but are specific of thermal sources only . for instance , thermal sources can be modelled as perfectly incoherent , and the cross - spectral density assumes the form    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the source intensity distribution and @xmath48 is the two - dimensional dirac @xmath48-function .",
    "however , there is a close connection between the state of coherence of the source and the angular distribution of the radiant intensity ( see eq .",
    "( [ inte ] ) ) . the physical interpretation of eq . ( [ therm ] )",
    "is that the source is correlated over the minimal possible distance ( which is of order of the wavelength ) .",
    "this has the consequence that the radiant intensity is distributed over a solid angle of order @xmath49 .",
    "this is correct for thermal sources , but is in contradiction with the fact that any synchrotron radiation source is confined within a narrow cone in the forward direction .",
    "the high directionality of synchrotron radiation rules out the use of eq .",
    "( [ therm ] ) as a model for synchrotron radiation sources . however , such high directionality is not in contrast with the poor coherence which characterizes the quasi - homogeneous limit .",
    "quasi - homogeneous sources are only locally coherent over a distance of many wavelengths but , by definition of quasi - homogeneity , the linear dimension of the source is much larger than the correlation distance . even though a quasi - homogeneous source can be described with geometrical optics techniques , a coherence distance of many wavelengths rules out the use of eq .",
    "( [ therm ] ) as a model for synchrotron radiation sources",
    ". a more precise knowledge of the cross - spectral density ( that is equivalent to the knowledge of the correct phase space density ) is necessary to solve the image formation problem .",
    "for instance , suppose that a light source is placed at arbitrary distance in front of a lens .",
    "if the source is perfectly incoherent ( thermal light case ) the area of the light incident on the lens is always the area of the lens . in the case of synchrotron radiation source",
    "though , such area may be smaller than the lens . even in the limit for a large beam emittance ( compared with the radiation wavelength ) , information about the small angular distribution",
    "must be printed in the wavefront at the exit of the undulator leading once more to the same conclusion : eq .",
    "( [ therm ] ) can not be used in order to model synchrotron radiation sources . in @xcite",
    "we treated , among other cases , the asymptote for a large electron beam size and divergence .",
    "the expression for the cross - spectral density of the source in free space simplifies and a particular quasi - homogeneous model can be given .",
    "in the same work , we specified also the region of applicability of such model , and we showed that it can not be applied outside the limit for a large electron beam size and divergence .    in relation with these remarks",
    "it should be mentioned that an attempt to follow the path proposed in this paper is described in @xcite . to our knowledge",
    ", @xcite constitutes the first remarkable attempt to use statistical optics techniques in order to characterize the evolution of partially coherent x - ray beams through optical systems . in that work , as well as in @xcite",
    ", the beamline optics from the undulator to the specimen can be modelled as a critical illumination system @xcite , the beamline behaving as the condenser . after this",
    ", statistical optics techniques are consistently used to calculate coherent properties on the image plane .",
    "however , the authors of @xcite reduced the general ten - dimensional integrals to four - dimensional integrals by postulating that the cross - spectral density distribution at the exit of the undulator can be written as eq .",
    "( [ therm ] ) , i.e. a perfectly incoherent source is assumed at the exit of the undulator . as we have just seen though ,",
    "this assumption is always inconsistent in the case of synchrotron radiation , even in the geometrical optics limit and , _ a fortiori _ , in the case treated by the authors ( the undulator beamline 12 at als ) , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 , which is highly spatially coherent .",
    "we organize our work as follows . besides this introduction , in section",
    "[ sec : elem ] we describe the optical system under study and some concepts from statistical optics that will be widely used in the following sections . in section [ sec : fila ] we review some general expressions pertaining undulator radiation from a single particle . in particular , following @xcite we present an analytical expression for the fourier transform of the electric field generated by a single electron with offset and deflection which is valid at any distance from the exit of the undulator .",
    "we also present the analytical solution of the imaging problem for a deterministic model of undulator radiation ( absence of electron beam emittance ) . in section [ sec :",
    "emit ] we give a derivation of the cross - spectral density for undulator radiation based sources .",
    "subsequently we analyze the evolution of the cross - spectral density function through the optical system with particular attention to the focal and to the image plane .",
    "the following two sections [ sec : qhso ] and [ sec : nong ] describe quasi - homogeneous sources , respectively gaussian and non - gaussian , in the ideal case when the lens is aberration - free and the pupil aperture is non - limiting .",
    "a digression is then taken in section [ sub : imfoge ] , where we analyze in detail the relation between geometrical optics and quasi - homogeneous sources .",
    "such section may therefore be skipped in a first reading , without interrupting the main logical stream of our work .",
    "the next section [ par : ngdgb ] describes the effects of a finite aperture size on the radiation characteristics from quasi - homogeneous sources at the image plane , and is followed by section [ sec : abe ] that assumes a quasi - homogeneous source as well and deals with the consequences of lens aberration on the intensity at the image plane . in section [ sec : cam ] we introduce a particular setup , a pinhole camera , capable of producing images of the sources in the absence of lenses .",
    "the study of this particular setup is of particular interest because it allows the reader to recognize mathematical analogies between cases otherwise physically different and serves as a junction between the previous section [ sec : abe ] and section [ sec : focim ] treating physical cases when one obtains , surprisingly , the image of the source on the focal plane . in the following section [ sec : imany ]",
    "we extend the treatment for the focal plane to any plane of interest . in section [ sec : dof ] we discuss the depth of focus , including the case of a large non - limiting aperture and the effects of aperture size . in the next section [ sec : nonh ] solutions for the image formation problem in non - homogeneous cases relevant for third generation synchrotron radiation sources are given . before conclusions , in section [",

    "this program of development of synchrotron radiation theory was formulated more than ten years ago .",

    "this demonstrates that when third generation light sources were born , it was immediately recognized that the usual theory of synchrotron radiation was not adequate to describe them . yet , up to now , no theoretical progress has been made in that direction .",
    "the present paper , as well as our previous work @xcite are devoted to the realization of the before mentioned program of development of synchrotron radiation theory .",
    "in @xcite we described spatial coherence propertied of undulator radiation from third - generation light sources in free space . in this paper",
    "we aim at an extension of @xcite .",
    "previous scientific works and textbooks postulate that the cross - spectral density at the virtual undulator source can be described in terms of a gaussian - shell model or , even more restrictively , that undulator sources are perfectly incoherent .",
    "such assumption is not adequate when treating third generation light sources , because the vertical emittance is comparable or even much smaller than the radiation wavelength ( i.e. @xmath1354 ) in a wide spectral interval extending from the @xmath1355mstrong wavelength range up to the soft x - rays .    in this work we combined statistical optics methods with fourier optics techniques in order to describe in an analytical way the propagation of the cross - spectral density of synchrotron radiation through a lens . in particular , we focused our attention on the problem of finding both the intensity and the spectral degree of coherence of undulator radiation at the focal and at the image plane of the lens .",
    "although our paper is not limited to this situation alone , our main result deals with the quite generic case of a large normalized horizontal emittance @xmath1356 and an arbitrary vertical emittance @xmath1357 .",
    "our paper provides physical understanding of a setup of general interest and we expect it to be useful for practical estimations in almost all range of the parameter space for third generation light sources .",
    "we expect that , in the future , numerical codes fully capable of dealing with transverse coherence properties of synchrotron radiation will also be developed , and will be capable of providing detailed analysis of particular experimental setups .",
    "our theory will be of help to developers of these codes because it provides both benchmarks and partially manipulated equations for the field correlation , simpler to treat numerically than first principle calculations and still reasonably generic .",
    "two basic non - restrictive assumptions made in our theory are the paraxial approximation and the resonance approximation .",
    "the first is justified by the fact that we are treating an ultra - relativistic system .",
    "the second means that we are working with an undulator composed of a large number of period @xmath238 and that we are interested in frequencies near the fundamental .",
    "this allows to neglect the vertical polarization component of the field and to treat the field within a scalar theory .    analytical studies also required the introduction of some restrictive assumptions introduced in our theory , to be relaxed in the future .",
    "first , we assumed that the beta functions in both directions have their minima in the center of the undulator .",
    "however , beta functions are ( or may be ) often tuned around the center of the undulator in cases of practical interest .",
    "second , we assumed a single converging thin lens with none or very specific pupil functions .",
    "however , other shapes of the lens can be accounted for by means of numerical convolutions between a more complicated complex pupil function and our fundamental results referring to the case when influence of the pupil is negligible .",
    "note that the situation of a thin lens is often met in practice in the case of x - ray radiation , as grazing incidence reflective optics is quite frequently used for image formation in this spectral range .",
    "third , we assumed that monochromatization is good enough to neglect finite bandwidth of the radiation around the fundamental and also electron beam energy spread .",
    "both these effects may be taken into account by an extension of this theory . however , in practical cases of interest these restrictions are often met .",
    "for instance , a monochromator relative bandwidth of @xmath1358 is sufficient to guarantee a reasonably narrow bandwidth for undulators up to about @xmath1082 periods .",
    "also , with this number of undulator periods , such a monochromator guarantees small corrections to our results for electron beams with a relative energy spread of @xmath1358 or better .",
    "the three before mentioned assumptions are somewhat restrictive .",
    "however , they are often met in practice and our theory can be extended to the case when they are not met .",
    "a more restrictive assumption is that radiation frequency is tuned at perfect resonance with the fundamental frequency of the undulator .",
    "although this last assumption is also often met in practice , our theory can not be easily extended to account for the situation when it is not satisfied because the starting point for the calculation of the cross - spectral density is given by an expression for the electric field around the fundamental frequency .    as a final remark",
    ", it should be said that we chose not to deal with bending magnet sources in this paper .",
    "this is left for future investigations . however , some estimates based on dimensional analysis suggest that , as discussed in section [ sub : imfoge ] , geometrical optics treatments may be sufficient to describe in a satisfactory way bending magnet radiation from third generation light sources .    to conclude , our paper constitutes , to our knowledge , the first satisfactory theory describing imaging of undulator sources by a single non - ideal lens .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the analysis of a single lens for simplicity , the results for more complicated optical systems involving a larger quantity of optical elements being a straightforward extension of the present work .",
    "the authors wish to thank hermann franz and petr ilinski for many useful discussions , jochen schneider and edgar weckert for their interest in this work .",

    "<S> in this paper we analyze the image formation problem for undulator radiation through an optical system , accounting for the influence of the electron beam emittance . on the one hand , image formation with synchrotron radiation is governed by the laws of statistical optics . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the widely used gaussian - shell model can not be applied to describe the coherence properties of x - ray beams from third generation synchrotron radiation sources . as a result , a more rigorous analysis of coherence properties is required . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a technique to explicitly calculate the cross - spectral density of an undulator source , that we subsequently propagate through an optical imaging system . </S>",
    "<S> at first we focus on the case of an ideal lens with a non - limiting pupil aperture . our theory , which makes consistent use of dimensionless analysis , also allows treatment and physical understanding of many asymptotes of the parameter space , together with their applicability region . </S>",
    "<S> particular emphasis is given to the asymptotic situation when the horizontal emittance is much larger than the radiation wavelength , which is relevant for third generation synchrotron radiation sources . </S>",
    "<S> first principle calculations of undulator radiation characteristics ( i.e. ten - dimensional integrals ) are then reduced to one - dimensional convolutions of analytical functions with universal functions specific for undulator radiation sources . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider the imaging problem for a non - ideal lens in presence of aberrations and a limiting pupil aperture , which increases the dimension of the convolution from one to three . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we give emphasis to cases when the intensity at the observation plane can be presented as a convolution of an impulse response function and the intensity from an ideal lens . </S>",
    "<S> our results may be used in practical cases as well as in benchmarks for numerical methods .    </S>",
