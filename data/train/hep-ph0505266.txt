    "diffractive production of vector mesons ( vm ) in dis @xmath12 ( @xmath13 etc . ) is a very active field of research ( see recent review @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "so far , the main focus has been on the ground state mesons , while diffractive production of excited states has not enjoyed much attention . perhaps , the most studied case so far was the production of radially excited charmonium @xmath14 , where remarkable consequences of the presence of a node in the radial wave function @xcite were nicely confirmed by h1 measurements @xcite .",
    "experimental studies of excited @xmath15 production should be even more rewarding .",
    "first , production of excited mesons probes the dipole cross section at larger dipole sizes than the production of ground states , see e.g. analysis of @xmath15/@xmath16 in @xcite and the recent study of @xmath17 in @xcite .",
    "such sensitivity to soft diffraction can help understand the phenomenon of saturation , @xcite . besides",
    ", it is expected that diffractive production of @xmath15 can help resolve the long standing puzzle of the radial / orbital excitation assignment to the @xmath10 and @xmath11 mesons and @xmath11 mesons , the author of @xcite concludes that `` the way forward with @xmath18 @xmath19 states is to study diffractive dissociation of the photon '' .",
    "] , see @xcite .    diffractive production of excited @xmath15 mesons has been observed in a number of fixed target experiments with relatively high energies .",
    "diffractive production of @xmath20 was reported in @xmath21 @xcite and @xmath22 @xcite final states ( for reanalysis of these data in terms of @xmath10 and @xmath11 mesons see @xcite ) .",
    "these states were also studied in the fermilab experiment e687 @xcite both in @xmath23 and @xmath22 channels .",
    "in addition , there are indications that the @xmath11  which is believed to be predominantly the orbital excitation  can play essential role in an interesting narrow dip structure observed by e687 in the @xmath24 final state @xcite .",
    "however , all these experiments gave only the value of the photoproduction cross section , and neither energy or @xmath2 dependence , nor helicity structure of the reaction was studied .",
    "this gap was partially filled by the h1 measurement of @xmath15 electroproduction at @xmath25 gev@xmath26 @xcite , but due to low statistics the results presented had large errorbars .    in theory , production of orbitally excited vector mesons",
    "is expected to be suppressed by fermi motion , as its radial wave function vanishes at the origin .",
    "this suppression was believed to be sufficiently strong and even prompted the authors of @xcite to consider diffractive @xmath10 and @xmath11 production neglecting in both cases the @xmath9-wave contributions altogether . only in @xcite",
    "were the @xmath8-wave and @xmath9-wave vector meson production amplitudes calculated within the @xmath0-factorization approach , and the first estimates @xcite showed that at small - to - moderate @xmath2 the production rates of the @xmath9-wave and @xmath27 @xmath15 states were roughly of the same order .",
    "in this paper we extend this research and report more detailed numerical results on @xmath9-wave vector meson production .",
    "we use the usual notation for kinematical variables .",
    "@xmath2 is the photon s virtuality , @xmath28 is the total center - of - mass energy of the @xmath29 collision .",
    "the momentum transfer from proton to photon is denoted by @xmath30 and at high energies is almost purely transverse : @xmath31 .",
    "the transverse vectors ( orthogonal to the @xmath29 collision axis ) will be always labelled by an arrow .",
    "diffractive production of meson @xmath32 with mass @xmath33 can be treated in the lowest fock state approximation as production of the @xmath19 pair of invariant mass @xmath34 , which is then projected , at the amplitude level , onto the final state . within the leading log@xmath35 accuracy",
    "the higher fock states are reabsorbed into the evolution of the unintegrated gluon density ( or color dipole cross section ) .",
    "a typical amplitude contains the valence quark loop , with integration over the quark transverse momentum @xmath36 and its fraction of photon s lightcone momentum @xmath37 , and the uppermost gluon loop , with the integration over transverse momentum @xmath38 .    throughout the text ,",
    "the ground state vector mesons ( always understood as @xmath39 states ) will be generically labelled by @xmath32 or @xmath40 , their radial excitations will be labelled by @xmath41 , while the pure @xmath9-wave vector mesons will be labelled by @xmath42 .    a generic form of the helicity",

    "the radial wave function of the vector meson depends on the spherically symmetric quantity @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the relative @xmath19 momentum written in the @xmath19 rest frame .",
    "@xmath49 is the skewed unintegrated gluon distribution , with @xmath50 being the fractions of the proton s momentum carried by the uppermost gluons .",
    "the appearance of skewed ( or generalized ) parton distributions is characteristic for scattering processes that change the mass / virtuality of the projectile @xcite . in the @xmath0-factorization approach ,",
    "the skewness is transferred to the unintegrated distributions .",
    "the real part of the amplitude can be reconstructed from the imaginary part ( [ ampl ] ) using analyticity .",
    "the twist analysis of helicity amplitudes ( [ ampl ] ) was performed in @xcite .",
    "the principal findings were : ( 1 ) the longitudinal cross section was found to be particularly suppressed in comparison with @xmath8-wave meson production , which translated into abnormally small @xmath3 ratio , and ( 2 ) the @xmath4-channel helicity non - conserving ( schnc ) amplitudes played much more important role than in the case of @xmath51 .",
    "a comparison of @xmath42 and the spin-3 ground state of the same quarkonium @xmath52 performed in @xcite offered an insight into smallness of @xmath53 in terms of clebsch - gordan coefficients .",
    "here we present numerical results for the most interesting case of @xmath54 , which in this section we identify with the physical state @xmath11 .    in order to integrate ( [ ampl ] ) numerically , one needs to specify models for the off - forward unintegrated gluon density and for the vector meson wave function .",
    "the former was related to the forward unintegrated gluon density , see @xcite , whose parametrizations were borrowed from @xcite .",
    "the choice of a particular parametrization affects the numerical results only marginally . for the vector meson wave function we used the appropriately normalized gaussian ansatz .",
    "the particular choice of the radial wave function changes sizably only the overall normalization of the predicted cross sections , but not their shapes .",
    "the experimental value of the leptonic decay width @xmath55 , which was used to fix the size parameter of the wave function , is known very poorly , which significantly affects the accuracy of our predictions .",
    "below , we show numerical results using @xmath560.7 kev .",

    "[ fig - q2dep ] we show the longitudinal and transverse cross sections for @xmath54 as well as for @xmath51 and @xmath57 . at the photoproduction point , @xmath60 , and it increases slightly towards higher @xmath2 .",
    "the cross section of @xmath54 production by longitudinal photons is always small , @xmath610.03 , in agreement with qualitative studies @xcite .",
    "this translates into anomalously small longitudinal - to - transverse ratio @xmath62 , which is illustrated by fig .",

    "comparison of @xmath63 and @xmath64 shows that at small @xmath2 , and in particular , at the photoproduction point , @xmath54 should dominate over @xmath57 . at moderate @xmath65 gev@xmath26",
    "both mesons are expected to be produced at comparable rates , and at @xmath66 gev@xmath26 the @xmath57 production should take over .    fig .",
    "[ fig - schnc ] demonstrates the role of schnc transitions in @xmath54 production . in accordance with expectations , at small @xmath2 the @xmath4-channel helicity violating amplitudes generate a sizable portion of both longitudinal and transverse cross sections .",
    "as @xmath2 grows , the schnc effects gradually die out , however , their magnitude is still larger than schnc observed in production of ground state @xmath51 mesons @xcite . at small @xmath2 , the presence of strong helicity violating amplitudes noticeably modifies the @xmath67-dependence of the differential cross sections at @xmath68 gev@xmath26 .",
    "we also checked the energy dependence of the @xmath54 production cross section , which can be conveniently parametrized with simple power law , @xmath69 .",
    "we checked the @xmath2 behavior of the exponent @xmath70 and found it somewhat smaller than the corresponding exponent for @xmath51 production .",
    "this can be traced back to the larger color dipole sizes probed in @xmath54 production and to the enhanced contribution from larger @xmath71 region , although the effect is not as dramatic as in the case of spin-3 meson production , see @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath10 and @xmath11 were well separated eigenstates of the @xmath19 angular momentum , then using @xmath2 behavior of their diffractive production cross sections , fig .",
    "[ fig - q2dep ] , one could easily tell radial from orbital excitation . in reality one has to account for a possibly strong mixing between the radial and orbital excitations as well as for their significant overlapping .",
    "the legitimate question is whether diffractive production can be used under these circumstances to probe the structure of @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "analysis of this type was conducted in @xcite , where authors considered both @xmath10 and @xmath11 as states composed of a pure @xmath27 and of anything else ( orbital excitation , hybrid etc . ) .",
    "they determined the mixing angle to be @xmath72 , and were able to describe the scarce experimental data available . with too many assumptions ( @xmath73 , strict schc etc . ) and poorly known parameters , the precision of the results obtained in @xcite seems to us doubtful .",
    "we agree with @xcite that one should study not @xmath10 and @xmath11 separately but @xmath21 or @xmath22 final state in the entire region of multipion invariant mass @xmath74@xmath75 gev . in our opinion ,",
    "two quantities are particularly useful for determination of the internal structure of @xmath10 and @xmath11 : ( i ) the @xmath2 variations of the invariant mass shape , and ( ii ) the level of @xmath4-channel helicity violation .",
    "both quantities should be studied in the region of small - to - moderate @xmath2 , precisely where the @xmath76 cross section is expected to have strong variations due to the node effect .",

    "the @xmath90-shape at fixed @xmath2 and its variation with @xmath2 growth show interesting dependence on the mixing angle .",
    "another way to separate radial / orbital excitations is to study the magnitude of the @xmath4-channel helicity non - conservation @xmath91 as a function of the final state invariant mass @xmath83 .",
    "although at the photoproduction point both @xmath57 and @xmath54 have roughly @xmath5@xmath92 of their cross sections coming from schnc amplitudes , their interference pattern is sensitive to the mixing .",
    "[ fig - mix - schnc ] shows values of @xmath93 in the cases of @xmath21 ( left plot ) and @xmath22 ( right plot ) final states in the photoproduction limit .",
    "for these plots , we took @xmath94 . in the @xmath21 case ,",
    "the helicity violating amplitudes come from excited states , while the helicity conserving amplitudes have a non - trivial interference between @xmath51 and excited states .",
    "this produces a peak in @xmath95 plot , whose position is sensitive to the mixing angle . in the @xmath22 final state",
    ", there is no @xmath51 contribution , and the schnc is substantial throughout the whole @xmath90 region shown , its interference pattern again sensitive to the mixing .",
    "we underline that figs .",
    "[ fig - mix ] ,  [ fig - mix - schnc ] show only typical patterns to look for .",
    "exact predictions are difficult due to too many poorly known parameters in the game .",
    "in 1980 s the omega collaboration has studied diffractive photoproduction of @xmath20 meson in @xmath21 and @xmath22 channels . from the published results @xmath96 @xcite and @xmath97 @xmath98b @xcite one can estimate the @xmath20 photoproduction cross section as roughly 1 @xmath98b .",
    "although these results were reanalyzed in @xcite in terms of two excited states @xmath10 and @xmath11 , we find it more secure to compare our results with the original data .    as shown on fig .  [ fig - q2dep ] , our predictions for the photoproduction cross sections are @xmath99 @xmath98b , @xmath100 @xmath98b . however , since @xmath10 and @xmath11 are broad interfering peaks , the integration of @xmath101 within the region @xmath1021.8 gev yields @xmath1033 @xmath98b , depending on the @xmath79 mixing angle , which is not far from experiment .",
    "as discussed above , detailed studies of the @xmath23 or @xmath22 mass spectrum , in particular , the level of @xmath4-channel helicity violation , can help resolve the @xmath8/@xmath9-wave structure of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "extraction of schnc amplitudes relies on reconstruction of the angular distribution of the final multipion state . for the @xmath21 state",
    "this procedure was described in @xcite , while for the @xmath22 state more analysis in the spirit of @xcite should be done .",
    "note that the conclusion made in the latter paper that at least half of all @xmath22 events under the peak come from an schc mechanism does not contradict the results of our calculations .",
    "when extracting @xmath15 from the multipion final states , one must subtract from the data the @xmath104 contribution , which is not negligible and which is predicted to have extremely large schnc contibutions , see @xcite .",
    "such a separation would be possible if one either performs the full partial wave analysis , which is more suitable for the @xmath21 final state , or extracts a specific signal in the multipion final states , like @xmath105 .",
    "we also briefly comment on the recent observation by focus experiment @xcite of a very statistically significant enhancement in the diffractive photoproduction of @xmath106 pairs at @xmath107 mev .",
    "the experiment ruled out the possibility to explain this enhancement with @xmath108 meson , which is believed to be mainly @xmath27 excitation of @xmath109 .",
    "one could speculate if this new resonance could be the orbitally excitated @xmath109 meson .",
    "if so , our calculations predict the photoproduction cross section @xmath110300 nb , which is @xmath111 of the @xmath109 photoproduction cross section calculated in the same model .",
    "unfortunately , the experimental paper does not give the measurement results for the cross section .",
    "in this paper we considered diffractive production of orbitally excited vector mesons in dis , with a major focus on the @xmath9-wave @xmath15 state .",
    "the calculations were performed within the @xmath0-factorization framework .",
    "although the predictions for the absolute values of the cross sections are plagued by large uncertainties of the input parameters , we find that several qualitative conclusions are stable :    * the @xmath54 production cross section is roughly an order of magnitude smaller than the @xmath51 production cross section . at small @xmath2 , @xmath64 is larger than @xmath63 , casting doubt on the relevance of @xmath112 assumption used in @xcite .",
    "* studying @xmath113 and @xmath114 separately , we observe strong suppression of the longitudinal cross section , which translates into very small ratio of @xmath59 , as was anticipated in @xcite . *",
    "the role of the @xmath4-channel helicity violation is more important in @xmath9-wave state production than in the ground state production , especially at small @xmath2 .    besides",
    ", our results confirm general expectations that the experimental study of diffractive multipion production in the invariant mass region of @xmath1 interference can be a key to the @xmath27-wave/@xmath9-wave assignment to these two mesons .",
    "study of the @xmath2 variation of @xmath90 shapes of the cross section as well as checking the level of @xmath4-channel helicity violation should be of much help .",
