    "spectral properties of optical fiber waveguide gratings  @xcite have typically been addressed with coupled - mode theory ( cmt )  @xcite .",
    "the theory relies on entities with a clear physical interpretation and despite its approximations ( slowly varying amplitude , small index modulation , and synchronous approximations ) it has proved successful in accounting for the behavior of long - period gratings ( lpgs ) and bragg gratings ( bgs ) with uniform dielectric modulation , i.e. a dielectric modulation of the grating with constant period and peak value . over the years corrections to cmt for non - uniform gratings as well as more general solutions have been addressed in a number of papers including refs .  .",
    "others have addressed the problem of gratings with arbitrary dielectric modulations through iterative solution of integral equations in inverse scattering methods , such as the gelfand  levitan  marchenko coupled equations  @xcite . the iterative solution of the integral equations scales as @xmath2 , where @xmath1 is the number of points along the propagation axis , and does not always converge for strong bragg gratings . the convergence problem can be remedied by using the approximate layer - peeling algorithm  @xcite which is based on a combination of transfer matrices  @xcite and a differential scattering formulation  @xcite . originating in geophysics",
    "the layer - peeling algorithm divides a non uniform grating into a number of uniform segments .",
    "numerically the method scales as @xmath3 .    in this paper",
    "we offer a green s function method ( gfm ) based on the solution of the _ dyson _",
    "s integral equation that is exact for coupling of co - propagating transverse electric waves as well as counter - propagating transverse electric waves .",
    "the numerical implementation scales as @xmath0 .",
    "our calculation of the green s function formally relies on methods from quantum mechanics and the many - body theory of condensed matter systems , see e.g. refs .  .",
    "interpreting the green s function as a space(-time ) propagator immediately provides us a link to the transmission and reflection properties of finite - length gratings and thus forms a physical interpretation of the green s function .",
    "the gfm thus offer an exact integral method , which also may be formulated in terms of transfer matrices .",
    "furthermore , perturbative calculations may be readily be carried out with the dyson s equation . to demonstrate the method we calculate spectra , time delay , and dispersion characteristics for uniform , as well as apodised and chirped fiber gratings .",
    "the green s functions and the dyson s equation have previously been used in electromagnetical systems for a variety of problems ( see ref .   and references therein ) , among those finite size 2d photonic crystals  @xcite .",

    "such techniques have made gratings widely used as highly selective bandpass filters @xcite , dispersion compensators and pulse compressors  @xcite and optical sensors  @xcite .",
    "with apodisation the magnitude of the peak dielectric modulation varies across the length of the grating .    with chirp the period of the grating varies across the grating .",
    "apodisation and chirp , however , may also appear as an unwanted error in an intended uniform grating due to fabrication imperfections .",

    "however , we can at no cost incorporate it in the free forward and backward green s function propagators and we refer to these new propagators @xmath76 as the _ intermediate green s functions_. by this trick we eventually end up with a dyson s equation for the full green s function with a particular simple structure . to see this we split @xmath77 into two hermitian operators : a self - coupling operator ( s ) , which is diagonal in its indices , and a cross ( x ) coupling operator which is purely off - diagonal :    @xmath78    the diagonal , self - coupling component , @xmath79 ,",

    "the gfm could therefore be applied for better apodisation of lpgs .",
    "bgs have a large number of periods , and thus cmt and gfm agree well for the uniform and the weakly apodised and chirped bgs presented in this report .",
    "however , bgs are being designed with increasing complex dielectric modulations to obtain extraordinary spectral and dispersive characteristics .",
    "the gfm may here be useful in the respect , that it does not divide the dielectric modulation into uniform segments , and therefore offers more freedom when designing the apodised dielectric modulation .",
    "the gfm could also be used to study the mechanisms of apodisation , which are still not completely understood @xcite .",
    "the examples considered have all been fiber gratings .",
    "the gfm method is exact for transverse electric modes , but some optical fibers do not support these transverse modes .",
    "however the non - transverse part of a mode usually only holds a very small fraction of the total electrical field and contributes only negligible to the grating characteristics .",
    "although the presented theory is exact from the transverse electrical wave equation eq .",
    "( [ eq : eigenfreq_r ] ) the theory is in fact only exact within the basis set of the electric fields of the reference system ( in finite element methods this is known as galerkin error being zero ) .",
    "the electrical fields of the reference system may or may not describe the grating well .",
    "this is actually a feature in all grating theories and should not cause any worries , but some consideration should be taken when applying the gfm to high - index contrast systems .",
    "a discussion of the variational error of the basis set can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the green s functions and the dyson s equation have here been used to model linear dielectric modulations .",
    "the theory can be adapted to a non - linear dielectric modulations , both local and non - local , for simulating harmonic generation , soliton dynamics and other non - linear effects .",
    "if a non - local dielectric modulation is used then powerful perturbative methods can be employed such as the feynman diagrams used in many - body physics .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : disp_delay_kl=4 ] ,  [ fig : disp_delay_kappa_pi2 ] it is seen that the group delay for both bragg and long - period gratings is negative near resonance .",
    "this may seem conflicting with casuality , but physically it is perfectly possible that the group velocity ( pulse envelope velocity ) is greater than the speed of light or even zero  @xcite causing negative time delays .",
    "however , numerical simulations indicate that negative group velocities are impossible in passive one - dimensional periodic media  @xcite .",
    "a method for calculation of optical - waveguide gratings optical characteristics based on green s functions and the dyson s equation has been presented .",
    "we have presented accurate spectra for long - period and both uniform and apodised bgs as well as the group delay and dispersion characteristics .",
    "the gfm is exact for transverse electric modes for gratings with arbitrary dielectric modulations in both the long - period and the bg application .",
    "the method incorporates self - coupling in an exact analytic manner and also gives an exact resonance condition for gratings with arbitrary dielectric modulations .",
    "the gfm relies on iterative solution of integral equations which scales as @xmath0 which may be solved to within any given accuracy ."
