    "the prospect of separating the thermal and kinematic components of the s - z effect while minimizing astrophysical confusion makes observations at mm wavelengths attractive .",

    "because we have no information about the distribution of the ic gas along the line of sight , we are required to make some simplifying assumptions about the temperature and density form factors .",
