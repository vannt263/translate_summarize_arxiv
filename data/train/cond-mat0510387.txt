    "a superlattice ( sl ) is a set of regularly spaced quantum wells , coupled together via tunneling across the barriers separating them . in such a system , electrons move freely parallel to the plane of the wells , while their perpendicular motion ( i.e. that in the growth direction ) gives rise to the existence of energy minibands , whose widths are proportional to the strength of inter - well coupling . in a short - period sl , only the lowest miniband is usually occupied .",
    "the quasiclassical interpretation of magnetotransport experiments relies on the onsager - lifshitz quantization rule @xcite . for the longitudinal magnetoresistance",
    ", it leads to shubnikov - de haas oscillations , which are periodic in @xmath1 and the period is given by extremal cross - sections of the fermi surface perpendicular to the direction of the applied field @xmath2 .",
    "there is , however , experimental evidence , that the quasiclassical interpretation of the data may fail in semiconductor sls in tilted fields .",
    "the failure is attributed to the in - plane component of the field @xmath2 , that suppresses electronic tunneling between wells , when their separation becomes comparable with the in - plane magnetic length @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "we have recently studied the problem theoretically @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to compare the longitudinal magnetoresistance @xmath4 , measured on the gaas / algaas superlattice with rather strong inter - well coupling , with the predictions of the above mentioned model calculations .",
    "are displayed in the upper part of the figure . to emphasize the fine structure of the curves ,",
    "their second derivatives are shown in its lower part . ]",
    "the mbe - grown sl with 30 periods consists of 29 gaas quantum wells of nominal width 5.0 nm , separated by @xmath5 barriers of total nominal width 4.0 nm .",
    "each barrier is composed of the inner si - doped layer 2.7 nm thick , surrounded by undoped 0.65 nm thick spacers . the dopants provide electrons for 2d electron sheets in the wells , but simultaneously limit their mobility and influence the effective height of the barriers . taking these nominal values ,",
    "we get for the sl period in the growth direction @xmath6 = 9.0 nm .",
    "we have checked the periodicity of the structure using the x - ray diffraction .",
    "it confirmed its excellent crystallographic quality , but provided the slightly smaller period @xmath6 = 8.5 nm .",
    "we will use this experimental value of @xmath6 below .",
    "several samples in the hall bar geometry have been etched out of this wafer and equipped with evaporated augeni contacts .",
    "both the longitudinal and hall resistances were measured at @xmath7 = 0.4 k in magnetic fields up to 28 t. the sample could be rotated to any angle between the perpendicular ( @xmath8 ) and in - plane ( @xmath9 = 90@xmath10 ) orientations . the standard low - frequency ( @xmath11 = 13 hz ) lock - in technique has been used for the measurement .    due to quasi-3d nature of the sample , it was not possible to determine the effective electron concentration and mobility from the low - field data .",
    "in a weakly coupled system , deviating from the present one just by the width of quantum wells ( nominally about 19 nm instead of 5 nm ) we could observe well developed quantum hall plateaus indicating that 27 - 28 2d layers of 29 were occupied with about the same electronic concentration .",
    "we assume , that the same holds for the present sample as well .",
    "let us shortly remind the essence of the model calculations presented in ref.@xcite . in a tight - binding model of minibands in 3d superlattices , we get an energy spectrum in the form @xmath12 it consists of the energy of the free motion in the @xmath13 plane and the approximately cosine dispersion relation of the miniband in the growth direction @xmath14 .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 characterizes the effective height and width of the barriers separating individual quantum wells .",
    "the period @xmath6 of the sl determines the size of the brillouin zone : @xmath16 .",
    "the fermi surface of systems with the fermi energy @xmath17 within the miniband @xmath18 has a closed semielliptical shape . for @xmath19",
    ", it is an open corrugated cylinder .",
    "if we apply an external magnetic field @xmath2 , the energy spectrum converts to a set of landau subbands .",
    "let us suppose , that @xmath20 , and that it changes its orientation between perpendicular @xmath21 and in - plane @xmath22 configurations .",
    "magneto - oscillations are determined by extremal cross - sections of the fermi surface and a plane perpendicular to @xmath2 .",
    "these oscillations are periodic in @xmath1 with a period determined by the cross - section area @xmath23  : @xmath24 this quasiclassical approach works well at low magnetic fields .",
    "the above outlined description becomes completely inadequate for strong in - plane fields @xmath25 .",
    "matrix elements of the one - electron hamiltonian are then given in the tight - binding approximation by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the magnetic - field - dependent wave - vector with @xmath28 .",
    "the energy spectrum consists of landau subbands periodic in @xmath29 with the period @xmath30  : @xmath31 the subbands @xmath32 are flat and separated by wide gaps at low @xmath33 , at high fields the subbands become wide and the gaps narrow . therefore",
    ", the strong in - plane field @xmath33 changes the topology of the equienergetic lines @xmath34 . for large @xmath33 , @xmath30 becomes larger than the diameter of the free - electron fermi circles @xmath35 .",
    "fermi contours do not cross anymore and inter - well tunneling becomes impossible .",
    "this is the meaning of the statement , that strong in - plane fields suppress inter - layer coupling and facilitate the 3d@xmath02d transition in sls .    upon lowering @xmath33 , fermi contours first touch at the brillouin zone boundaries , when @xmath17 reaches the top of the lowest landau subband .",
    "then they merge into an open contour and new closed fermi ovals belonging to the next higher subband appear , when @xmath17 reaches its bottom .",
    "these events correspond to two types of critical fields @xmath36 and @xmath37 . at @xmath38 ,",
    "@xmath17 touches the bottom of a landau subband .",
    "@xmath39 has a minimum there and a step - like singularity appears in the dos . at @xmath40 , @xmath17 coincides with the top of the subband , which corresponds to a saddle point in @xmath39 and to a logarithmic singularity in the dos .",
    "= 4.7 mev and @xmath17 = 5.2 mev lead to good agreement between the experimental and theoretical curves .",
    "the inset shows two cross - sections of the fermi surface , the @xmath41 on the horizontal axis denotes either @xmath42 or @xmath43 . ]",
    "experimental curves of the longitudinal magnetoresistance @xmath4 for various tilt angles @xmath9 are displayed in the upper part of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . to emphasize the fine structure of the curves ,",
    "their second derivatives are shown in its lower part .",
    "the oscillations can be seen on all the curves , including that obtained in strictly in - plane fields .",
    "the oscillations of the magnetoresistance in lower fields are found to be periodic in @xmath1 and the periods have been employed to characterize the sample in terms of the model described above .    .",
    "]    fitting the parameters of equation  ( [ area ] ) to the experimental data , we were able to get the values of the coupling constant @xmath15 = 4.7 mev and of the fermi energy @xmath17 = 5.2 mev .",
    "the fit quality is illustrated by fig .",
    "experimental points stem from the periods of oscillations .",
    "the parameters @xmath15 and @xmath17 have been calculated from the data for two extreme tilt angles @xmath44 and @xmath45 and inserted to equation  ( [ area ] ) to get the theoretical interpolation curve drawn in fig .",
    "the fit is quite good , confirming that the model is adequate to describe the experimental data .",
    "the data also allow to reconstruct the fermi surface shape , as seen on the inset of fig .",
    "as expected from the values of the model parameters , it really has a form of a semielliptic closed body entirely contained within the first brillouin zone .",
    "experimentally determined parameters have been used to calculate the dos for four lowest landau subbands .",
    "they are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] together with the resulting total dos as functions of the in - plane field @xmath33 .",
    "the logarithmic and step - like singularities can be clearly distinguished in the @xmath46 and @xmath47 subbands only . in higher subbands",
    "they merge and partial doss acquire the same form as that for the strictly 3d systems . in the first subband only the logarithmic singularity can exist .",
    "the pictures in the upper part of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] illustrate changes of the fermi surface topology assigned to particular singularities in the dos .",
    "only the fermi lines of the lowest two landau subbands are displayed .",
    "the thick red curve in fig .  [ fig3 ] represents the second derivative of the experimental magnetoresistance curve , corresponding to the in - plane orientation of the applied magnetic field .",
    "there is excellent agreement of the magnetoresistance peaks positions with the maxima of the dos .",
    "slight asymmetry of the magnetoresistance peak corresponding to the passing of @xmath17 through the subband @xmath46 may be attributed to the separation of both dos singularities due to the finite width of the subband .",
    "the magnetoresistance maximum at the highest field apparently reflects the logarithmic singularity in the first landau subband .",
    "the periods of oscillations of low - field magnetoresistance were used to construct the fermi surface of the sl .",
    "the good fit of the theoretical curve confirms that the two - parameter cosine model of the miniband is appropriate to describe the experimental data .",
    "the strong in - plane magnetic field suppresses inter - well coupling and finally converts the 3d electronic system of the sl to an multiple 2d layer system .",
    "the description of this process requires a fully quantum - mechanical approach .",
    "the oscillations of the calculated dos are in excellent agreement with oscillations of experimental magnetoresistance curves .",
    "it proves , that the model is consistent and can be used to explain qualitatively the magnetoresistance data on strongly coupled semiconductor superlattices .",
