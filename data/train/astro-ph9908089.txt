    "mg2016 + 112 is one of the first discovered gravitational - lens system .",
    "lawrence et al .",
    "( 1984 ) observed three distinct radio sources , a , b , and c. further higher resolution radio map resolved c into multiple components ( garrett et al .",
    "1994 , 1996 ) . at optical wavelength ,",
    "the image a and b are point - source but the image c is a fainter resolved object ( lawrence et al .",
    "1984 ; schneider et al . 1985 , 1986 ) .",
    "spectroscopic observations revealed that a and b show very similar spectra dominated by strong ultra - violet ( uv ) emission - lines redshifted to z=3.27 ( lawrence et al .",
    "1984 ; schneider et al .",
    "although the optical spectrum of c has not been fully published so far , it has always been considered at the same redshift as a and b after its detection in the redshifted ly@xmath0 narrow - band data ( schneider et al .",
    "1986 ) .",
    "the mg2016 + 112 lens system is enigmatic for 3 reasons .",
    "first , the lensed object itself is very unique among known high - redshift galaxies ( lawrence et al .",
    "it has been conventionally called a ` quasar ' since it is a fairly luminous point - like object . however , a and b show only _ narrow _ emission lines and thus mg2016 + 112 is not an ordinary broad - line quasar .",
    "although strong narrow emission lines are typically seen for high - redshift powerful radio galaxies ( hzprgs ) , mg2016 + 112 appears somewhat different from the known hzprgs .",
    "indeed , hzprgs are typically extended in optical images and have lobe - dominated radio structures with a scale of a few tens of kpc while a and b show only point - like features even in high - resolution optical and radio images .",
    "it is important to investigate the true nature of the lensed object .",
    "second , image c is a very complex object : at optical and near - infrared ( nir ) wavelength , c is resolved and has an arc - like morphology .",
    "radio - to - optical flux ratio of c is several times larger than those of a and b and can not be explained by variability and time delay . at radio wavelength",
    ", c is resolved into two components , c@xmath1 and c@xmath2 .",
    "while a , b and c@xmath2 ( sometimes referred as c@xmath3 in literatures ) are point - like objects even at 15-mas resolution , c@xmath1 has been further resolved into three chain - like components ( garrett et al .",
    "radio spectral shape of c@xmath2 is similar to those of a and b ( @xmath4 ) but c@xmath1 has significantly flatter one ( @xmath5 ) . whether c@xmath1 is a radio galaxy at different redshift or a lensed image of the outer structure of the radio source at z=3.27 is still in question .",
    "finally the nature of the lens producing this multiple image system is still an enigma .",
    "deep optical and nir images have detected a red galaxy d amid images a , b and c. ( schneider et al .",
    "1986 ; langston , fisher , & aspin 1991 ; lawrence , neugebauer , & matthews 1993 ) .",
    "galaxy d seems to correspond to an evolved giant elliptical galaxy at z@xmath6 .",
    "however , the image separation requires a mass - to - light ratio for d much larger than typical one . while lens models have assumed the existence of a high - redshift massive cluster as an additional source of lensing mass ( narasimha et al .",
    "1984 , 1987 , 1989 ; nair & garrett 1997 ; langston et al .",
    "1991 ) , at first no signature of such a cluster has been seen in the optical and nir observations ( schneider et al .",
    "1987 ; langston et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "recently , hattori et al . (",
    "1997 ) detected an extended x - ray emission in the direction of mg2016 + 112 , possibly emitted by the hot gas in the lensing cluster of galaxy .",
    "a strong emission - line - like feature consistent with iron lines redshifted to z @xmath7 was detected .",
    "this discovery could in principle solve the ` dark - lens ' problem for mg2016 + 112 , but opened another question of a ` dark cluster ' , namely , the lack of optical counterpart of the x - ray hot gas . very recently , kneib et al .",
    "( 1997 ) spectroscopically detected several galaxies at z@xmath7 and bentez et al .",
    "( 1999 ) observed a possible color - magnitude sequence of faint red galaxies in this field arguing for the existence of a distant massive structure at z@xmath7 .",
    "we have obtained new spectra of components b , c , d of the mg2016 + 112 system . in this paper",
    ", we analyze the emission lines of image b and c in order not only to investigate the intrinsic nature of mg2016 + 112 but also to understand the component c in view of the lens - model prediction .",
    "observations and data reduction are described in sect .",
    "2 . in sect .",
    "3 , we examine the observed emission line properties . the line flux ratios are compared with the prediction of the photo - ionization models as well as those of other high - redshift objects in various categories . in sect .",
    "4 , the nature of image c is discussed in the context of lens models .",
    "we then argue that mg2016 + 112 may be a _ radio - quiet _",
    "type-2 quasar based on the results obtained in sect .",
    "3 as well as those discussed in literatures . throughout this paper",
    "we use @xmath8 km / s / mpc , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "spectroscopic observations were made with the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) using the subarcsecond imaging spectrograph ( sis ; le fvre et al . 1994 ) in august 1997 .",
    "the stis2 2048@xmath112048 ccd with 21 @xmath12 m pixel and the r150 grating were used and the resultant dispersion is 2.88   per pixel .",
    "the wavelength coverage extends from 4500 to 9000  .",
    "two multi - slit masks were used to obtain spectra of candidate cluster galaxies in the field .",
    "each slit has 7.8-arcsec - long and 0.78-arcsec - wide aperture , which gives @xmath13   instrumental resolution .",
    "mg2016 + 112 b , b@xmath1 , and d were observed within one slit of the first mask ( mask1 ) and c with a slit in the second one ( mask2 ) . in total , 6 and 5.8 hours exposures",
    "were obtained for mask1 and mask2 , respectively .",
    "the data was pre - reduced using standard iraf tasks .",

    "wavelength calibration was done with the arc - line spectra taken at the observation .",
    "typical internal error of wavelength determination is @xmath14  .",
    "the flux calibration was done using the spectroscopic standard star gd248 ( oke 1990 ) .",
    "note that the flux calibration becomes more uncertain above 7500 - 8000  because no order - separating filter was used and the flux is contaminated by the uv and blue contribution of the second order filter .",
    "we tried to carefully take into account this effect but flux calibration may remain uncertain above 8000  .",

    "figure 3 shows the results of two - component gaussian fitting of the  lines for b and c. they can not be perfectly fitted with a single component but can be better fitted with a narrow plus broad components .",
    "it seems strange that the  line has a broad component while the  line , which comes from the gas at higher ionization stage and may be closer to the central engine , shows only a narrow one .",
    "it may be due to the extinction of the broad component of the  line .",
    "another possibility is that the wings are the lines of other ions contaminating this spectral range .",
    "the broad  feature is not a unique characterestics of mg2016 + 112 lensed object .",
    "10214  ( searjeant et al .",
    "1997 ) and  ( ivison et al . 1998 ) also show similar property .",
    "searjeant et al . (",
    "1997 ) argue the possibility of contamination by siiii lines for the blue - wing feature of the  line in the spectrum of 10214  but the model can not fully explain the observed feature .",
    "it is interesting that those two gravitationally - lensed type-2 agn as well as mg2016 + 112 show evidence of a broad  line .",
    "next , we investigate the line flux ratios .",
    "there are significant differences between line ratios of component b and c. while the /  ratio of image b is 0.28 , the ratio of c is 0.51 . also , the /  ratio of b and c is 0.17 and 0.51 , respectively if we consider the narrow components .",
    "if we fit the lines with single gaussian component , then the ratio is 0.40 and 1.32 .",
    "the emission - line gas in image b seems to be at higher ionization stage than in c. in fig .",
    "4 , we compare these line ratios with those predicted by photoionization models ( cloudy90 , ferland 1988 ) .",
    "we examined the cases with hydrogen density n@xmath53=100 and 1000 @xmath54 , power - low ionization continuum with @xmath0=1 and 1.4 , and a range of ionization parameter , @xmath55=@xmath56-@xmath57 and solar - abundance .",
    "the obtained line ratios are fairly consistent with the typical photo - ionization models considered for narrow - line region of agn .",
    "the differences in line ratios between b and c may be interpreted as the difference in ionization parameters",
    ".    there may be an effect of the reddening by dust in the object on the observed line ratio . according to calzetti s reddening fomula for starburst galaxies ( sawicki & yee 1998 ) , the reddening of @xmath58 shifts the observed values with @xmath59log(/)=@xmath60 and @xmath59log(/ ) = @xmath61 , respectively , which is shown by the arrow in fig .",
    "even if there is a fairly large amount of reddening , @xmath62 , the discussion we give here is not so much affected .",
    "there are weak but fairly significant  lines in the spectra of b and c. in fig .",
    "5 we plotted the observed  line ratios as well as those predicted by photoionization models . clearly , photoionizatin models that can explain the line ratios at lower ionization state are not consistent with the observed  flux .",
    "the observed  lines are more than several times stronger than the predicted value .",
    "reddening correction moves the points further away from the models . the origin of  line may be different from those of other lines since the ionization potential of n@xmath63 is 77.5 ev which is significantly higher than those of  ( 47.9 ev ) ,  ( 24.4 ev ) , and  ( 24.6 ev ) .",
    "it may also be due to the nitrogen over abundance .",
    "in fact , the situation is not special for mg2016 + 112 b and hamman & ferland ( 1993 ) also compare their photoionization models with the observed lines of broad - line region ( blr ) of quasars and found a large nitrogen over abundance . there is also similar nitrogen problem for the optical  lines observed in the spectra of local agn ( e.g. , osterbrook 1986 ) .",

    "the line ratios of image b is very different from typical hzprgs",
    ". the line ratios of c and 10214   lies near the edge of the distribution of line ratios of hzprgs .",
    "we also plotted the line ratio of the _ broad lines _ observed in quasar spectra compiled by baldwin et al .",
    "they are very different from both hzprgs and image b and c. for a comparison , we show the predictions of photoionization models with very high - density gas with n@xmath53=@xmath66 @xmath54 in fig .",
    "4 considering that the density may be as high as 10@xmath67 @xmath54 in the quasar blr . the line ratios of _ broad lines _ quasars in fig .",

    "several lens models have been proposed for mg2016 + 112 ( narasimha et al . 1984 , 1987 , 1989 ; langston et al . 1991 ; nair & garrett 1997 ; bentez et al .",
    "these models are constructed to match the optical and/or radio data such as image positions and flux ratios of the various components .",

    "predict smaller ionization parameter for c , which is a natural consequence if the component c is dominated by the light of a region at @xmath681.5 - 2 times larger radius from the nucleus than the source region of the component b ( assuming similar density ) .",
    "it is unlikely that the differences in line ratios of b and c is due to the contamination by a possible radio galaxy at the similar redshift assumed as the counterpart of the bright flat - spectrum radio component c@xmath1 .",
    "if the high /  ratio observed in the spectrum of image c is due to such a contamination , for example , the assumed radio galaxy should have /  ratio larger than @xmath7 .",
    "radio galaxies rarely show such high /  ratio .",
    "our spectroscopic results thus support lens models like the ones proposed by langston et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and bentez et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . in these models ,",
    "the agn and the narrow - emission - line region is located somewhat outside the fold caustic in the source plane , which results in forming the images a and b. the outer regions of the source extends over the caustic and the region which is very close to the caustic is largely amplified and form an arc - like lensed images at the position of component c. radio sources at position c are interpreted as a lensed image of a jet which extends inside the caustic .",
    "the counter images of the component c will exist at position a and b but is mostly swamped by the agn light due to a smaller amplification factor ( compared to position c ) .      since only the narrow emission lines are observed , the object is likely to be an obscured agn .",
    "obscured agn may be classified to either of powerful radio galaxies or radio - quiet type-2 quasars if the intrinsic power of the agn is so powerful to be regarded as a quasar .",
    "the number of known radio - quiet type-2 quasars ( hereafter simply referred as type-2 quasars ) are still very small , which may be due to selection effects .",
    "previous quasar surveys with methods such as uv excess , objective prism , soft x - ray are not sensitive in searching for type-2 quasars .",
    "there are only several examples of type-2 quasars at high redshift which are serendipitously discovered in far - infrared , sub - mm , and x - ray source surveys .",
    "if mg2016 + 112 at z=3.27 is a type-2 quasar , it would be the highest - redshift type-2 quasar and thus provides a unique and important example for further studies of type-2 quasars .",
    "the observed radio flux density of image b at 1.47 ghz is 61.7 mjy ( lawrence et al .",

    "indeed , as mentioned in the previous subsection , the observed radio power of mg2016 + 112 after lensing amplification correction seems too faint to be classified as radio - loud , which suggests that this object is a _ radio - quiet _ agn .",

    ", some outer structures are also seen in the radio maps of the nearby radio - quiet quasars .",
    "the maximum extent of the radio emission of resolved sources is typically a few kpc .",
    "it is possible that such a structure associated with the lensed object extends over the diamond caustic of the source plane to form the strongly amplified radio image at the position of component c.      the central engine of mg2016 + 112 must be obscured since only the narrow emission lines are observed .",
    "the radio and optical morphologies are both compact , which is not compatible with typical properties of hzprgs but common for radio - quiet agns .",
    "the radio power is much smaller than typical radio - loud quasars at z@xmath96 but consistent with luminous radio - quiet quasar .",
    "finally , the emission line flux ratios of image b are not compatible with typical hzprgs .",

    "<S> we present new high signal - to - noise ratio spectra of the components b and c of the gravitational lensing system mg2016 + 112 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that image c displays strong emission lines of ly@xmath0 , , , , and  redshifted to z=3.27 , similar to images a and b. we examine the emission - line flux ratios in order to put constraints on the lens models as well as to investigate the intrinsic nature of mg2016 + 112 . the observed line ratios of b and c are consistent with those expected in the simple photo - ionization models for narrow - line region of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) except for the enhanced  lines . </S>",
    "<S> the line ratios difference of components b and c can be interpreted as a difference in ionization parameters . this result is consistent with lens model prediction that c is a fold image of a slightly outer part of the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> mg2016 + 112 is known to be very unique among the high - redshift agn ; it is neither an ordinary broad - line quasar nor a powerful radio galaxy as indicated by the width and flux ratio of the emission lines . </S>",
    "<S> together with other observed properties discussed in literature , we argue that mg2016 + 112 is the highest redshift luminous radio - quiet type-2 quasar . </S>"
