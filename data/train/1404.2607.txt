    "one of the most important results on observational cosmology is the discovery , using type ia supernovae ( sneia ) as standard candles , of the accelerating expansion of the universe @xcite .",
    "however , the use of sneia is difficult beyond @xmath3 and limited up to @xmath4 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is therefore of paramount importance to calibrate other independent distance indicators able to measure the universe expansion",
    ". it would be even better if such a method would be able to probe even beyond these redshifts , where the differences among various cosmological models are larger .",
    "given their high luminosities , since their discovery there have been several studies on the use of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) as standard candles or rulers @xcite .",
    "more recently , also thanks to a better understanding of the agn structure , more promising methods have been presented ( see @xcite and the review therein ) .",
    "for example , many authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) use the tight relationship between the luminosity of an agn and the radius of its broad line region ( blr ) established via reverberation mapping to determine the luminosity distances .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite suggest that super - eddington accreting massive bh may reach saturated luminosities , which then provide a new tool for estimating cosmological distances .",
    "besides agn , gamma ray bursts ( grb ) have been used as standard candles , however their low identification rate makes their use difficult ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .    here",
    "we propose a new method to predict the agn luminosity based on the combination of the virial relations , which allow to derive the bh mass ( m@xmath5 ) from the agn luminosity and the width of the lines emitted from the blr , and the well established anti - correlation between m@xmath5  and the x - ray variability amplitude .",

    "* ) is now well established . by combining the velocity , @xmath6 , of the blr clouds ( assuming keplerian orbits ) along with their distance r it is possible to determine the total mass contained within the blr ( which is dominated by the bh ) using @xmath7    where g is the gravitational constant , @xmath8 is the virial product and _ f _ is a factor which depends on the geometric and kinematic structure of the blr .",
    "these techniques derive m@xmath5  using se spectra to measure @xmath9v from the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of some of the blr lines ( typically : h@xmath10 or mgii2798  or civ1459 ) and r from either the continuum or the line luminosities , l , which have been proved to be proportional to r@xmath11 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , the se estimates are based on relations of the type    @xmath12    where the values of the parameters @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 depend on the emission line of the blr used .",

    "whose m@xmath5 has been measured with reverberation mapping techniques , these kinds of relationships could have spreads as narrow as 0.2 - 0.4 dex @xcite .",
    "the origin of m@xmath5  -@xmath24relation ( eq . [ eq : mvar ] ) is to be found in the dependence on m@xmath5  of the time - scales of what appears to be a universal shape of the agn variability power spectral density ( psd ) .",
    "indeed , the agn x - ray psds are generally well modelled by two power laws , @xmath25 , where the psd slope is @xmath26 down to a break frequency @xmath27 , that scales primarily with m@xmath5 , and then steepens to @xmath28 at larger frequencies .",
    "however , measuring the shape of the agn x - ray psd is very data demanding , requiring high quality data on many different time - scales .",
    "therefore these studies are confined to a relatively small number of sources .",
    "on the contrary , the excess variance @xmath24 is a robust estimator as it corresponds to the integral of the psd on the time scales probed by the data .",
    "the scaling of the characteristic frequencies of the psd with m@xmath5  ( and the roughly similar psd normalisation at @xmath27 ) induces a dependence of the excess variance with m@xmath5  ( if computed at frequencies above @xmath27 ) .",
    "the two equations ( [ eq : mrev ] and [ eq : mvar ] ) used to estimate m@xmath5  can be combined to derive the intrinsic agn luminosity as a function of its x - ray variability , @xmath29 , and line width , @xmath6 :    @xmath30    which , if we ( for the sake of simplicity ) assume @xmath31 and @xmath32 , becomes    @xmath33    in this work we aim to verify if the above proposed relationship does work and then calibrate it . it should be noted that , in many previous studies , a correlation between the agn luminosity and x - ray variability has been measured ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "according to the above discussion , we believe that such a correlation is the projection on the l-@xmath24 plane of our proposed 3d relationship among l , @xmath24 and @xmath6 ( eq . [ eq : relation ] ) . if this is the case , we should measure a more significant and less scattered relation than previously reported using only l and @xmath24 .",

    "@xmath24 , l@xmath41 and fwhm@xmath39 , we can ignore the uncertainties on l@xmath41 as they are experimentally less than 3% , while the uncertainties on @xmath24  are in the range 10 - 90% ( see table [ tab : sample ] and references therein ) . as far as the fwhm measures are concerned , and although in some cases the uncertainties are reported in the literature , we have preferred to assume a common uncertainty of 20% following the results of @xcite .",
    "the data and the results of the fit are shown in figure [ fig_1 ] and table [ tab : fit ] .",
    "the logarithm of the square of the virial product , computed using l@xmath41 and fwhm@xmath39 , is strongly correlated with the logarithm of @xmath24 : the correlation coefficient , r@xmath46 , has a probability as low as @xmath47 that the data are randomly extracted from an uncorrelated parent population .",
    "the observed and intrinsic ( subtracting in quadrature the data uncertainties ) spreads are : 1.12 dex and 1.00 dex , respectively .",
    "a correlation between the agn luminosity and the x - ray variability ( without using the line width of a blr line as a second parameter ) of the type    @xmath48    was already reported ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "if the same sample is used , the linear correlation between logl@xmath49 and log@xmath24has a spread of 1.78 dex ( instead of 1.12 dex ) while the correlation coefficient is -0.36 instead of -0.73 ( see figure [ fig_1 ] and table [ tab : fit ] ) .",
    "it is then evident that the virial product is significantly better correlated with the agn variability than the luminosity alone .",
    "slightly better results are obtained if the intrinsic 2 - 10 kev luminosity , l@xmath50 , instead of the optical luminosity , l@xmath41 , is used to compute the virial product . in this case",

    "a further step is necessary , such as a dedicated wide field x - ray telescope ( wfxt ) with an effective collecting area at least three times larger than _ athena _ and @xmath12 deg@xmath11 large field of view . in this case , as an example , with a 40 ms long program it would be possible to measure d@xmath69 with less than 0.003 dex ( 0.015 mag ) uncertainties at redshift below 1.2 and an uncertainty of less than 0.02 dex ( 0.1 mag ) in the redshift range @xmath86 .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ fig_4 ] illustrates more clearly the potential of our new estimator .",
    "the curves represent the per cent difference of the luminosity distance models shown in the upper panel with respect to its reference best fit scenario . from the comparison between the magenta error - bars with the model scatter",
    ", we conclude that our estimator has the prospect to become a cosmological probe even more sensitive than current sneia if applied to agn samples as large as that of an hypothetical future survey carried out with a dedicated wfxt as described above .",

    "<S> we also discuss how , using a new dedicated wide field x - ray telescope able to measure the variability of thousands of agns , our estimator has the prospect to become a cosmological probe even more sensitive than current supernovae ia samples . </S>"
