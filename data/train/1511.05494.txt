    "the recent discovery of sdss j010013.02 + 280225.8 ( henceforth j0100 + 2802 ) , an ultraluminous quasar at redshift @xmath12 , has accentuated the problem of supermassive black - hole growth and evolution in the    early universe @xcite .",
    "each of the @xmath13 previously discovered quasars at redshifts @xmath14 @xcite contains a black hole with mass @xmath15 , challenging the standard model s predicted timeline , which would have afforded them fewer than @xmath16 myr to grow after the big bang , but likely even fewer than @xmath17 myr since the onset of population ii star formation . with an estimated mass of @xmath18 , ten times greater than the others ,",
    "j0100 + 2802 significantly compounds this time - compression problem .",
    "the early appearance of supermassive black holes is an enduring mystery in astronomy .",
    "such large aggregates of mass could not have formed so quickly in @xmath4cdm without some anomalously high accretion rate @xcite and/or the creation of unusually massive seeds @xcite , neither of which has actually ever been observed . in the local universe",
    ", black - hole seeds are produced in supernova explosions , which sometimes leave behind @xmath19 remnant cores , far from the @xmath20 objects required to grow via eddington - limited accretion into the billion solar - mass quasars seen at redshifts @xmath21 .",
    "any attempt at circumventing this problem is severely challenged by the fact that no high-@xmath22 quasar has ever been observed to accrete at more than @xmath23 times the eddington rate ( see , e.g. , figure  5 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in this paper ,",
    "however , we demonstrate that such exotic processes are actually not necessary to address this apparent anomaly ; although the timeline implied for the early universe by the existence of j0100 + 2802 and its brethren may be problematic in @xmath4cdm , it is fully consistent with standard astrophysical processes in the @xmath6 universe @xcite , an frw cosmology with zero active mass @xcite .",
    "indeed , this tantalizing discovery comes on the heels of recent high - precision baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) measurements @xcite , that have apparently ruled out the concordance model in favor of @xmath6 at better than the 99.95% c.l .",
    "a resolution of the time - compression problem implied by j0100 + 2802 therefore provides important and timely observational confirmation of these critical bao results .",
    "in the standard picture , the universe became transparent about 0.4 myr after the big bang , descending into darkness as the thermal radiation field shifted towards longer wavelengths .",
    "the so - called dark ages ended several hundred myr later , when density perturbations condensed into stars and early galaxies , producing ionizing radiation .",
    "current constraints @xcite place the epoch of re - ionization ( eor ) at @xmath24 which , in the context of @xmath4cdm , corresponds to a cosmic time @xmath25 myr ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,^,>,>,^,^ , < \" , ]     the best probes of the re - ionization process are actually the high-@xmath22 quasars themselves .",
    "the absence of structure bluewards of their ly-@xmath26 restframe emission observed by sdss at @xmath27 suggests a decreasing ionizing fraction along the line - of - sight @xcite . that the neutral fraction approaches @xmath28 by @xmath29 is supported by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap @xcite ) mission , whose measurements show that the universe was @xmath30 neutral at @xmath31 , with re - ionization starting before @xmath32 @xcite .     in @xmath4cdm , with concordance",
    "parameter values : @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 km s@xmath37 mpc@xmath37 . the range in timelines corresponds to @xmath38 .",
    "the dark ages evolved into the eor at @xmath39 myr ( @xmath29 ) , which lasted until @xmath0 myr ( @xmath40 ) . for @xmath41 and eddington - limited accretion , these three black holes would have had masses @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , respectively , at the start of the eor . the seeds would have been created @xmath45 myr , @xmath46 myr , and @xmath47 myr _ prior _ to the big bang.,width=480 ]    standard astrophysical principles suggest that ionizing radiation was produced by pop ii and iii stars . more exotic physics , invoking the decay of dark - matter particles or cosmic strings , is poorly known and , anyway ,",
    "appears to be too tightly constrained to account for the eor on its own @xcite .",
    "almost certainly , high-@xmath22 quasars became more important towards the end of the eor , though they probably could not have been the dominant source of ionizing radiation for the whole eor @xcite .",
    "our view of how the universe evolved through the dark ages and into the eor is informed by many detailed simulations that have been carried out in recent years @xcite .",
    "( for recent reviews , see refs .",
    "@xcite . ) according to these calculations , the first ( pop iii ) stars formed by redshift @xmath48 at the core of mini halos with mass @xmath49 @xcite . in the concordance @xmath4cdm model with parameter values @xmath33 ,",
    "@xmath34 , @xmath35 and hubble constant @xmath36 km s@xmath37 mpc@xmath37 , this redshift corresponds to a cosmic time @xmath50 myr .",
    "based on the astrophysics we know today , specifically the rate of cooling in the primordial gas , it is difficult to see how pop iii stars could have formed earlier than this .",
    "the subsequent transition to pop ii star formation incurred additional delays because the gas expelled by the first generation of pop iii stars had to cool and re - collapse .",
    "detailed calculations of this process show that the gas re - incorporation time was at least @xmath51 myr @xcite .",
    "so the formation of structure could not have begun in earnest until at least @xmath52 myr after the big bang , and the start of the eor presumably overlapped with the ramp up in pop ii star formation and evolution .",
    "standard astrophysical principles would suggest that this was also the time when @xmath2 black - hole seeds were created , presumably following the supernova explosion of _ evolved _ pop ii ( and possibly pop iii ) stars .",
    "in other words , unless we introduce new , exotic physics for the formation of these seeds , it is difficult to see how they could have emerged any earlier than the start of the eor , and certainly no sooner than the transition from pop iii to pop ii star formation .    without invoking anomalously high accretion rates , these seeds would have grown at a rate set by the eddington limit , defined to be the maximum luminosity attainable from the outward radiation pressure on ionized material under the influence of gravity . for hydrogen plasma , this power is given as @xmath53 ergs s@xmath37 , in terms of the black - hole mass @xmath54 .",
    "the mass accretion rate @xmath55 is inferred from @xmath56 with the inclusion of an efficiency @xmath57 for converting rest - mass energy into radiation .",
    "a minimum of @xmath58 is expected for @xmath57 in a schwarzschild black hole , but other factors ( such as a black - hole spin ) may enhance @xmath57 above this value . to allow for such variations ,",
    "one typically adopts the fiducial value @xmath59 .",
    "conventional astrophysics would then suggest that early black - hole growth was driven by an accretion rate @xmath60 , and solving for the mass as a function of time one then arrives at the so - called salpeter relation , @xmath61 where @xmath62 ( @xmath2 ) is the seed mass produced at time @xmath63 .",
    "it is now straightforward to see why the discovery of j0100 + 2802 at redshift 6.3 presents such a big problem for the standard model . with an inferred mass of @xmath64 , the minimal growth time implied by",
    "the salpeter relation is @xmath65 myr ( assuming conservatively that @xmath66 ) . and since in the standard model @xmath67 myr , not only is this quasar inconsistent with what is known about the transition from the dark ages to the eor , but it would have had to start growing _ before _",
    "the big bang , an obviously non - sensical interpretation .",
    "of course , these are the reasons some workers have been driven to find non - standard physics to account for the discrepancy between this implied timeline and the predictions of the standard model . but given that no evidence has been seen for such proposals , the only viable explanation within the context of @xmath4cdm appears to be the possible role played by mergers in the early universe @xcite",
    ". however , even this mechanism could only work if the black - hole seeds formed well before the eor , and their creation would have had to end by @xmath68 to avoid over - producing the low - mass end of the distribution . in other words ,",
    "the black - hole seeds would have had to be produced by unknown , exotic processes unrelated to the pop ii and pop iii star formation rate .",
    "also , a more recent consideration of possible mergers @xcite suggests that such events could not have been common in the early universe .",
    "simulations now show that pop iii stars needed very large halos to form , which would have decreased the halo abundance by orders of magnitude .",
    "in addition , the associated build - up of lyman - werner background radiation would have accelerated the dissociation of h@xmath69 , which was necessary for the star - formation process . both of these trends point to a reduction in the pop iii star formation rate , and therefore a reduction in the possible number of seed black holes .",
    "all in all , the mysterious appearance of billion - solar mass quasars at @xmath11 therefore constitutes significant tension with the standard ( @xmath4cdm ) model .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that a resolution of the time - compression problem revealed by supermassive quasars at high redshifts may be found more reasonably in the cosmology itself , rather than the physics of black - hole birth and evolution .",
    "recent observations have pointed to a growing inconsistency with @xmath4cdm @xcite , so it would not be surprising to find that its predicted age - redshift relation is also at odds with the quasar measurements .",
    "table 1 lists the highest redshift quasars discovered to date , including the most massive ( j0100 ) among them .",
    "the growth histories of three representative members of this group calculated using the salpeter relation ( equation  1 ) are illustrated in figure  1 , which also shows the duration of the dark ages and eor .",
    "the inferred black - hole mass @xmath54 in this table is calculated from the simultaneous measurement of the quasar s luminosity and the velocity of its line - emitting gas via the observation of its doppler - broadened mg ii line @xcite .",
    "this is made possible by reverberation mapping , which produces a tight relationship between the distance of the line - emitting gas from the central ionizing source , and the optical / uv luminosity @xcite .",
    "when high - quality line and continuum measurements are available , one can infer the black - hole mass from the relation @xcite @xmath70 in which the luminosity @xmath71 at rest - frame wavelength @xmath72 is calculated from the measured flux density @xmath73 separately for each assumed cosmology , which determines the luminosity distance . when needed , the bolometric luminosity is determined from @xmath71 using a bolometric correction factor @xmath74 .",
    "the process of identifying @xmath74 for these sources is somewhat tricky , but reliable @xcite , yielding the now commonly used value @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "the flux density @xmath73 is measurable to an accuracy of about @xmath76 , while the fwhm is accurate to about @xmath77 .",
    "equation  ( 2 ) therefore yields mass estimates accurate to about a factor @xmath8 ( i.e. , @xmath78 dex ) in most cases .",
    "of course , the caveat with the use of equation  ( 3.1 ) for this purpose is that the numerical scale @xmath79 was obtained using several thousand high - quality spectra from the sdss dr3 quasar sample @xcite , with a calibration to the h@xmath80 and c iv relations using the luminosity distance in the concordance model .",
    "the fact that @xmath81 appears in this expression means that one ought to separately recalibrate these values for each different cosmology , because the luminosity distance @xmath82 in @xmath6 is not the same as that ( @xmath83 ) in @xmath4cdm .",
    "however , it is well known by now that the ratio of these distances is very close to unity all the way to @xmath84 ( see , e.g. , figure  3 in ref .",
    "for example , @xmath85 over the redshift range @xmath86 .",
    "thus , the error implied for @xmath54 in equation  ( 3.1 ) due to differences in calibration between the two models is @xmath87 , which is well within the overall expected error of a factor @xmath88 in this expression .",
    "for the purpose of this paper , it is therefore safe to ignore such differences in calibration between @xmath6 and @xmath4cdm .    in the @xmath89 universe ,",
    "the age - redshift relation is simply given by the expression @xmath90 where , for ease of comparison between the two models , we use the same value @xmath36 km s@xmath37 mpc@xmath37 in both cases .",
    "in this model , the dark ages therefore ended  and the eor began  at approximately @xmath91 myr ( i.e. , @xmath29 ) , and reionization was completed by about 2 gyr ( @xmath40 ) . by comparison ,",
    "the eor lasted from @xmath92 myr to @xmath0 myr in @xmath4cdm .",
    "insofar as the eor is concerned , what we do know fairly well from observations is its redshift range , but the corresponding ages are less reliably known .",
    "however , there are several indications that the time compression problem associated with supermassive black holes occurs more generally . for example",
    ", the early appearance of galaxies at @xmath93 may be an even bigger problem than that for quasars @xcite because , whereas a single event could have created a quasar , galaxies had to form gradually through the assembly of more than @xmath94 stars .",
    "this does not appear to be feasible in such a short time following the transition from pop iii to pop ii stars with the @xmath95 yr@xmath37 star - formation rate predicted in the standard model .",
    "cosmology , which has only one free parameter : @xmath96 , whose value is assumed to be the same as in @xmath4cdm for ease of comparison . here , the eor lasted from @xmath97 myr to @xmath98 gyr ( @xmath9 ) , and the @xmath99 seeds would have formed at @xmath100 gyr ( j0100 + 2802 ) , @xmath101 gyr ( p338 + 29 ) , and @xmath102 myr ( j1120 + 0641 ) , shortly after the start of the eor.,width=480 ]    this question of how early galaxies formed is probably also linked to the source of ionizing radiation in the intergalactic medium . with",
    "the timeline afforded them in @xmath4cdm , the known sources of uv ionizing radiation , principally galaxies at intermediate redshifts and dwarf galaxies at higher redshifts , may have produced most of the ionizing radiation leaking into the intergalactic medium , but only for an inferred escape fraction of about @xmath103 , which is not consistent with other measurements that suggest a value as small as @xmath104 . however , if the eor is viewed in the context of @xmath6 , the extended timeline reduces the required escape fration to a value much closer to @xmath104 @xcite .    a comparison between the quasar timelines in figures  1 and 2 highlights the significant differences between these two models when it comes to how and when these supermassive black holes were formed . in @xmath6 ,",
    "all of the quasars seen at @xmath11 could have easily grown to their measured size via eddington - limited accretion within the eor .",
    "crucially , all of the required @xmath2 seeds would have formed _",
    "after _ the end of the dark ages , presumably from the supernova explosion of evolved pop ii and/or iii stars .",
    "the birth and growth of these high-@xmath22 quasars is therefore entirely consistent with standard astrophysical processes and our current understanding (   ii ) of how the first stars formed and evolved into nascent structure in the early universe .",
    "irrespective of whether or not mergers played a role in building up the black - hole mass distribution , black - hole seeds in @xmath4cdm would have had to form very early in the universe s history , well before the onset of re - ionization at @xmath29 .",
    "unless some unknown exotic mechanism was responsible for their creation , they would almost certainly have been produced by pop iii stars shortly after the big bang .",
    "however , no evidence of re - ionization has yet been found prior to the redshift ( @xmath68 ) where seed creation must have stopped in order to avoid overproducing lower mass black holes . reconciling these opposing trends may not be feasible .    in this paper",
    "we have assumed that the high-@xmath22 quasars accreted steadily at the eddington rate .",
    "their duty cycle is unknown , however , so it s possible that , on average , their rate of growth was less than eddington .",
    "this would lengthen the salpeter time ( @xmath105 myr ) even further , thereby exacerbating the time compression problem for @xmath4cdm .",
    "on the other hand , circumstantial evidence does suggest that when they were turned on , high-@xmath22 quasars did accrete at close to eddington .",
    "this is based on the maximum black - hole mass observed in the local universe @xcite .",
    "no more than a couple of @xmath106 black hole masses have thus far been detected , even after the peak quasar activity at @xmath107 @xcite . yet high-@xmath22",
    "quasars would have had to be more massive than @xmath106 in order to produce their fluxes measured at earth if they were accreting below the eddington limit .",
    "perhaps the solution to the time - compression problem in @xmath4cdm is simply that the high-@xmath22 quasars accreted steadily at super - eddington rates from the time their seeds formed all the way to when we see them at @xmath0 myr .",
    "but one can see from equation  ( 2.1 ) that in order to grow to @xmath108 in @xmath109 myr , they would have had to accrete at @xmath110 times the eddington rate throughout that epoch .",
    "one can not yet completely discount such a possibility , but we should then be able to find at least some members of this super - eddington class at @xmath27 .",
    "however , all the current observations appear to have ruled out the existence of such sources . the latest measurements @xcite indicate that the most distant quasars are accreting at no more than the standard eddington value , and their accretion rate is decreasing at smaller redshifts .",
    "when all the facets of the time - compression problem are considered together , the simplest and most elegant solution to the early appearance of supermassive black holes appears to be a change in the cosmology itself . in the @xmath6 universe ,",
    "the birth , growth and evolution of high-@xmath22 quasars are fully consistent with the principal timescales associated with pop ii and iii star formation , and the ensuing epoch of reionization .",
    "this picture supports the view that supermassive black holes probably did not contribute significantly to the ionizing radiation early on , but may have become more prominent contributors towards the end of the eor .",
    "indeed , it may turn out that the rapid ramp up in black - hole mass towards @xmath40 ( see figure  2 ) may have been responsible for completely ionizing the intergalactic medium , thereby bringing an end to the eor around @xmath40 .",
    "our conclusion adds some support to the possibility , already suggested by other kinds of observation  such as the latest high - precision baryon acoustic oscillation data @xcite  that @xmath4cdm does not account for high - precision cosmological measurements as well as @xmath6 does . the latter is itself an frw cosmology , though restricted by the zero active mass condition ( i.e. , @xmath111 ) , which is lacking in @xmath4cdm @xcite . with this constraint ,",
    "however , dark energy can not be a cosmological constant .",
    "its density must evolve dynamically , suggesting an origin in particle physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the analysis we have reported in this paper therefore has significant implications because , unlike many other kinds of cosmological measurements , the early appearance of quasars hinges on the time - redshift relationship rather than on integrated distances .",
    "it has the potential of opening up a new perspective on the expansion histories in different models in that crucial early period ( @xmath112 gyr ) when the dynamics differed significantly from one cosmology to the next .",
