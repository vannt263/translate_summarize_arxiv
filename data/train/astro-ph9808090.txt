    "recent observations of luminous infrared galaxies ( ligs ) indicate that most occur in interacting systems .",
    "it is thought that galaxy interactions can fuel seyfert - type activity in galactic nuclei ( e.g. xia  1998 and references therein ) and also result in prodigious starburst activity , often observed close to the nucleus .",
    "observations in the infrared ( ir ) band show strong emission from galaxies dominated by starburst activity .",
    "it is often difficult to determine whether these galaxies also have active nuclei , based on the ir data alone .",
    "radio and x - ray observations help clarify the picture .",
    "the amount of radio and x - ray emission expected from the observed starburst regions can be predicted , from observation of the phenomenon in normal galaxies ( david  1992 ) .",
    "some authors suggest that ligs represent an early phase of evolution for active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ; lipari , terlevich and macchetto ( 1993 ) found that most agn which have strong feii emission are also ligs .",
    "mrk  231 ( z=0.042 ) is an ultraluminous infrared galaxy , and one of the strongest known feii emitters .",
    "furthermore , mrk  231 has one of the highest bolometric luminosities in the local ( z @xmath1 0.1 ) universe ( sanders  1988 ) with @xmath2 ( rieke & low 1972 ) , @xmath3 ( soifer  1986 ) , @xmath4 ( lipari , colina & macchetto 1994 ) and @xmath5 ( soifer  1987 ) .",
    "boksenberg  ( 1977 ) show that an active nucleus exists in mrk  231 ; broad emission lines are observed from permitted transitions , the species and line widths are similar to those defining the seyfert  1 class .",
    "however , no narrow emission lines are seen except for o`[`ii ` ] ` @xmath6 .",
    "this o`[`ii ` ] ` emission line is probably produced in gas which is ionized by hot young stars ( smith  1995 ) rather than by ultraviolet radiation from the nucleus , since the latter is unlikely to emerge through the dense circumnuclear absorber .",
    "the absence of narrow emission lines is sometimes observed in quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) but not in seyfert galaxies .",
    "another extraordinary property of mrk  231 is the high polarization , @xmath7 at 2800   ( e.g. smith  1995 , after accounting for dilution from hot stars ) . in this case",
    "the polarized flux is thought to be nuclear emission scattered from circumnuclear dust ( smith  1995 ) .",
    "mrk  231 is radio - quiet but smith , lonsdale & lonsdale ( 1998 ) find the strength and compactness of the vlbi ( milli - arcsecond ) radio emission to infer the presence of an active nucleus .",
    "bryant & scoville ( 1996 ) find that starburst activity can only account for 40% of the ir luminosity in mrk 231 , supporting the evidence for an active nucleus , which must power the remaining emission .",
    "_ hst _ data showed a compact nucleus enclosed on the south side by a dense arc of star - forming knots concentrated @xmath8 away ( surace  1998 ) .",
    "it has also been suggested that there is a connection between the presence of strong feii emission and blueshifted absorption systems ( hartig & baldwin 1986 ; weymann  1991 ; lawrence  1997 ) , although the physical origin of this connection is unclear .",
    "mrk  231 has several blueshifted broad absorption line ( bal ) systems evident in the ultraviolet data .",
    "adams ( 1972 ) , boksenberg  ( 1977 ) , arakelian  ( 1971 ) , boroson  ( 1991 ) , rudy  ( 1985 ) and others discuss three distinguishable absorption systems in mrk  231 .",
    "the most prominent is defined by nai , caii and hei lines originating in gas with an outflow velocity @xmath9 relative to the line emission seen in the source .",
    "a second system shows only the d lines of nai and an outflow velocity @xmath10 .",
    "a third system is observed in balmer and caii absorption lines and has a redshift implying inflow at a velocity @xmath11 .",
    "a fourth system appeared between 1984 december and 1988 may , with prominent nai d and hei absorption at an outflow velocity of @xmath12 ( boroson  1991 , kollatschney , dietrich & hagan 1992 ) .",
    "further absorption variability was observed when a nai d line disappeared between 1991 and 1994 and the profile of some lines varied ( forster  1995 ) .",
    "rudy  ( 1985 ) showed that the shapes of absorption features and velocities in the absorbing gas systems of mrk  231 are the same as those observed in bal qsos and the gas is probably accelerated by the same mechanism .",
    "thus mrk  231 offers an opportunity to study the bal phenomenon at low redshift , and with a component containing species of unusually low ionization - state .",
    "most bal systems are dominated by high - ionization species such as civ@xmath13,1551 ; siiv @xmath14,1403 and nv@xmath15 , 1243 and only a small percentage of sources ( @xmath16 ) show absorption by low - ionization species , such as mgii @xmath17 , 2803 ; alii@xmath18 ; aliii@xmath19 , 1863 and cii@xmath20 ( voit , weymann & korista 1993 ) . absorption by na i d , he i@xmath21 and mg i@xmath22 as observed in mrk  231 , is quite rare .",
    "the detection of a 10@xmath23 silicate absorption feature indicates that dust is an important constituent of at least one of the absorbing systems in mrk  231 ( roche , aitken & whitmore 1983 ) .",
    "forster  ( 1995 ) conclude the absorption systems are most likely associated with mrk  231 , rather than intervening galaxies , although they find no evidence these systems are linked to a starburst - superwind in this case .",
    "rudy  ( 1985 ) also point out that the axial ratio in this source is 0.48 ( minor / major ) , and so the source is observed too close to a face - on orientation for the bal gas to be consistent with interstellar clouds in the plane of the host galaxy .",
    "mrk  231 also contains an oh maser ( baan 1985 ) and a co emission region to the nucleus ( scoville  1989 ) .",
    "bryant & scoville ( 1996 ) estimate that @xmath24 of gas lies within a radius 420 pc of the nucleus and the material is most likely in the form of a disk .",
    "new x - ray observations of mrk  231 are presented in this paper . in ",
    "2 the _ rosat _ hri image of the source is shown , and the soft x - ray spectrum observed by the pspc is discussed . in  3 an _ asca _ observation of mrk  231 is presented , which provides the first hard x - ray observation of this source , and only the second hard x - ray spectrum of a bal agn in the literature .",
    "mrk  231 was observed by the _",
    "rosat _ high resolution instrument ( hri ) between 1996 may 12 and 1996 june 11 , with a total exposure time of 31 ks .",
    "fig  1 shows the hri image , in @xmath25 bins , smoothed with a gaussian of width @xmath26 .",
    "a white cross shows the position of the optical and radio nucleus ( surace  1998 ) and the white bar shows an extent of @xmath27 .",
    "two x - ray peaks are evident , spaced @xmath28 apart .",
    "there is also the suggestion of asymmetric extent , with an extended region of x - ray flux west of the peaks .",
    "there are several other bright point sources in the hri image , and two were identified as the agn ` f219_015 ` and ` f219_045 ` .",
    "the optical positions ( obtained from ned , which contains a p.comm . from keith mason ) and the hri positions for these agn agreed to within @xmath29 , indicating an accurate aspect - solution for this image .",
    "the optical position of the nucleus is coincident with the region of relatively low x - ray flux , rather than the x - ray peaks in fig .  1",
    ". there are several other serendipitous point sources in the hri image and none show the x - ray extent evident in mrk  231 demonstrating that the extended emission observed for mrk  231 is real and not an artifact of attitude reconstruction problems in the hri image .",
    "the _ hst _ image of mrk  231 shows a great deal of structure ( surace  1998 , c.f .",
    "their fig .",
    "7 ) , most notably a region of emission to the nw of the seyfert nucleus , composed of knots of emission from star formation .",
    "another distinct peak in the _ hst _ data lies @xmath30 south of the nucleus , again due to star formation .",
    "the extended emission in the x - ray image seems to be similar in shape , but on a size - scale a factor of @xmath31 larger than that of the bright star - forming knots evident in the _ hst _ image . at a redshift z=0.042",
    ", @xmath25 corresponds to @xmath32 1 kpc ( assuming h@xmath33 , q@xmath34 ) and so the hri image implies emission across a total diameter of @xmath35 kpc .",
    "comparison with the _ hst _ image of surace  ( 1998 ; their fig .",
    "1 ) shows the x - ray emission matches the optical extent of the host galaxy .",
    "the total flux was @xmath36 ( assuming the spectral model derived from the pspc fit , as noted below ) .",
    "the luminosity in the observed x - ray emission is @xmath37 and so is higher than expected from the summed emission of stars and hot gas in a normal galaxy , but may be related to the starburst activity .",
    "the nucleus appears relatively weak in the 0.1  2 kev band , perhaps because it is more heavily absorbed than emission from regions further out in the galaxy .",
    "light curves were extracted from circular regions of radius @xmath38 centered on each of the x - ray peaks .",
    "no significant variability was evident in the time series from either region .",
    "the flux of the two peaks is almost equal , in the soft x - ray band .",
    "the flux of the nw peak is @xmath39 % of the total flux in the pair .",
    "the _ rosat _ pspc observed mrk  231 1991 june 7  8 for a total of 24 ks .",
    "the two peaks evident in the hri image can not be resolved using the pspc data ( which has a point - spread - function of width @xmath40 ) .",
    "the data were corrected for time - dependent effects using the tool pcpicor v 2.2.0 .",
    "source data were extracted from a cell of radius @xmath41 and background data from an annular region centered on the source ( but excluding some parts of the image contaminated by serendipitous sources ) . the pspc spectrum has already been presented by rigopoulou , lawrence and rowan - robinson ( 1996 ) .",
    "those authors noted a poor fit to a power - law model , attenuated by a column of neutral material . that result is confirmed here , yielding @xmath42 for 18 degrees of freedom ( @xmath43 ) .    the fit is significantly improved ( at @xmath44 confidence ) by addition of a narrow gaussian line with rest - energy @xmath45 kev and equivalent width @xmath46 ev ( @xmath47 ) confirming the rigopoulou  ( 1996 ) result and yielding a flux @xmath48 .",
    "this flux is in excellent agreement with that from the same region in the hri observation , as expected given the extent of the emission .",
    "strong line emission would be expected if the soft x - rays are from a region of starburst emission , and , as the image indicates the soft band is dominated by the emission from an extended region , the data were fit with a raymond & smith model ( 1977 ) ; this model describes the spectrum of radiation emitted by a hot optically thin plasma with abundances and equilibrium ionization balance appropriate to interstellar conditions .",
    "a single - temperature plasma is , again , a poor fit to the data ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the possibility of some contribution from the nuclear component was considered . adding a power - law to the fit yielded a photon index @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the absorption to both spectral components was found to be consistent with the galactic line - of - sight value @xmath52 ( elvis , lockman & wilkes 1989 ) .",
    "such a low absorption is consistent with the origin of the soft x - ray emission from regions outside of the nucleus .",
    "the nuclear component could be observed as scattered nuclear light , or could represent an unattenuated fraction of the nuclear continuum viewed through holes in the absorber .",
    "the parameterization using a raymond - smith plasma plus power - law is denoted  case-1  .",
    "alternatively , the single - temperature plasma may be an inadequate model for the starburst region .",
    "a two - temperature solution yielded a significant improvement to the fit with @xmath53 , a low temperature component @xmath54kev , with normalization @xmath55 and hot component @xmath56kev , @xmath57 .",
    "the normalization is in units @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the luminosity distance to the source ( cm ) , @xmath60 is the electron density ( @xmath61 ) and @xmath62 is the hydrogen density ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "the parameterization using a two - temperature raymond - smith plasma is denoted  case-2  .",
    "the _ asca _ solid - state imaging spectrometers ( siss ) and gas imaging spectrometers ( giss ) cover the @xmath32 0.4  10 kev and @xmath320.8  10  kev bandpasses , respectively .",
    "mrk 231 was observed by _",
    "1994 dec 5 .",
    "the data were reduced in the same way as the seyfert galaxies presented in nandra  ( 1997 ) and turner  ( 1997 ) . for details of the data reduction method and instruments",
    "see nandra  ( 1997 ) .",

    "f219_015 ` and ` f219_045 ` are not close enough to be confused with mrk  231 , but there are other sources of contamination as discussed below .",
    "_ asca _ light curves from each instrument were examined over the 0.5 - 10 kev range , using time bins covering 128s to 5760 s. mrk  231 was weak and the background light curve showed some low - amplitude variations , however , no flux variations were evident within the _ asca _ observation , which could be attributed to the agn .",
    "the source flux was @xmath64 in the 2  10 kev band corresponding to an observed luminosity @xmath65 .",
    "the soft flux is @xmath66 in the 0.5  2 kev band .",
    "this soft flux appears higher than that observed by _",
    "rosat _ , but the @xmath67 of the _ asca _ instruments is significantly wider than that of the _ rosat _ instruments .",
    "this is results in some contamination of the soft part of the _ asca _ spectrum by unidentified sources close to mrk  231 , evident in the pspc and hri images , as discussed in the following section .",
    "_ asca _ sis data below an energy of 0.60 kev ( 0.66 kev rest - frame ) were excluded from the spectral analysis as it is commonly accepted that there are uncertainties associated with the calibration in that band .",
    "the _ asca _ spectra were extracted using circular regions of radii @xmath68 and @xmath69 for the sis and gis instruments , respectively .",
    "the pspc image was then used to examine the sources of contamination in each case .",
    "the sis extraction cell encompasses one source of contamination , and the gis cell encompasses three .",
    "these sources were faint and unidentified , so it is difficult to model the precise contamination from each .",
    "however , it was found the contaminating flux from these serendipitous sources could be _ parameterized _ as 45% ( sis ) and 112% ( gis ) increases in the normalization of the thermal component ( @xmath70 kev ) used to model the circumnuclear emission in mrk  231 .      in case-1",
    "the soft x - ray flux was assumed to originate in a single - temperature raymond - smith plasma with some contribution from the nuclear continuum , viewed through unattenuated lines - of - sight or via scattering .",
    "the temperature and normalization of the raymond - smith plasma were fixed at the values determined from fitting the pspc data , with an adjustment to account for the soft flux from contaminating sources , as noted above .",
    "the nuclear power - law was modeled assuming attenuation by a column of neutral material , @xmath71 , at the redshift of the source and with a fraction of the emission assumed to be observed without attenuation .",
    "again , an additional column was fixed at the galactic line - of - sight value @xmath52 ( at a redshift of zero ) .",
    "this fit yielded a photon index @xmath72 , with a column @xmath73 covering 79% of the source ( fit 1 , table  1 ) .    if the circumnuclear material is ionized , then the column could be higher than that indicated by fits which assume a neutral absorber .",
    "the data were fit using models based upon the photoionization code ion ( netzer 1996 ) , once again , an unabsorbed thermal component of fixed temperature and normalization was allowed , the results are shown in table  1 ( fit 2 ) .",
    "if the column is assumed to be fully - covering the source , but ionized , then the inferred index is @xmath74 . in its simplest interpretation",
    "this represents an unusually flat index for the primary continuum .",
    "this may indicate another component is present , such as that due to compton reflection , flattening the observed spectrum .",
    "it is not possible to obtain useful constraints on compton reflection in mrk  231 ( using these data ) .",
    "therefore the fits were repeated with the photon index fixed at two values often found for seyfert galaxies ( e.g. george  1998 and references therein ) .",
    "this allowed an investigation of the nuclear attenuation under two simple assumptions , @xmath75 and @xmath76 . in both these cases ,",
    "the nuclear absorption was found to be @xmath77 ( fits 3 - 4 , table  1 ) .",
    "a small contribution to iron k@xmath78 emission is expected from the thermal component , and is visible in the model plot ( fig  2 , top panel ) .",
    "however , no significant line emission was detected from the k - shell of iron , ( although a high point on the data / model ratio is duely noted , fig .  2 , bottom panel ) .",

    "was assumed to be parameterized as a two - temperature raymond - smith plasma with the temperatures fixed at @xmath70 and @xmath80 kev , as found in  2 . in this case",
    "a two - temperature component was allowed in the model , with normalizations fixed at the values derived from the pspc data ( again with an adjustment to the normalization of the cool component to account for flux from the contaminating sources ) .",

    "the pspc spectra did not allow green  ( 1995 ) to determine whether this x - ray weakness was due to absorption of the x - rays by a large column of material , or whether the sources were intrinsically weak .",
    "an _ asca _ observation of phl 5200 ( mathur , elvis and singh 1995 ) had low signal - to - noise but indicated the presence of an absorbing column @xmath130 attenuating the nuclear x - rays .",

    "mrk  231 was found to be a persistent outlier on their correlation plots , often due to the weakness in the x - ray band .",
    "furthermore , lawrence  ( 1997 ) found the _",

    "however , all estimates of @xmath150 are consistent with the range @xmath151 observed for the radio - quiet quasars , ie .",
    "the higher luminosity sources studied by kriss & canizares ( 1985 ) . as a seyfert galaxy it would be considered to be at the x - ray - weak end of the distribution of indices for that class , but amongst qsos it would not be considered x - ray - weak at all . the nominal ranges for @xmath150 combined with the absence of narrow emission lines in the optical bandpass , the presence of bal systems and the high bolometric luminosity of mrk  231 suggests the source is closer in nature to a qso than a seyfert galaxy .",
    "an hri image of mrk  231 shows extended emission in the 0.1  2 kev band , of size - scale @xmath35 kpc in diameter , cospatial with the host galaxy .",
    "the nucleus itself appears faint in the soft x - ray band , probably due to absorption .",
    "the extended emission has a luminosity @xmath37 and is probably associated with starburst activity in the galaxy .",
    "the relative levels of ir and x - ray emission suggest some of the ir emission has an origin other than starbursts , or that the starburst region has a higher dust content than observed in other starburst galaxies .",
    "an _ asca _ observation revealed a hard x - ray source in mrk  231 .",
    "the spectrum indicates the x - ray column density is @xmath152 , attenuating the nuclear x - rays .",
    "consideration of the appropriate absorption - corrections to the optical and x - ray data infer an underlying spectral - energy - distribution for mrk  231 which is more like that of a qso than a seyfert  1 galaxy .",
    "i am grateful to  team for their operation of the satellite and to ian george and richard mushotzky for useful comments .",
    "thanks to keith mason for confirmation of the optical positions of some agn in the _ rosat _ field - of - view , and to hagai netzer for use of tables based upon ion .",
