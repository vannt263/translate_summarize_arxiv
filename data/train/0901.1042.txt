    "a paradigm change in astroparticle physics is often not believed to be necessary or even possible by most colleagues discussing the progress in confirmation of the experimentally accessible part of the standard model of particle physics .",
    "moreover , two sociological problems bother the communities .",
    "the information between the old and a new paradigm breaks down ( kuhn ) , if the new one contains too many new conceptions and new links between them .",
    "the power of communities is increased with the number of active members and with their intention to solve the problems during their time .",
    "the second problem forms a sharper hierarchy occasionally supporting ignorance and even arrogance against the bare announcement of a new paradigm .    to avoid kuhn s breakdown of information",
    ", first paradigmatic attempts should start from one or only a few key concepts which can understandably be explained .",
    "suppose that a new paradigm with many new concepts and links truly exists which is consistent with the confirmed part of standard models .",
    "then , to neutralize the negative power of the communities , the key concepts could be followed by a plausible , intuitive way to the new paradigm as a whole .",
    "the physical key concept of the first attempt ( this paper , later referred to as @xcite ) is the difference between mass and energy behind the @xmath3 formula .",
    "the key concept of a second attempt ( referred to as ( second part ) ) is a thermodynamic analysis of an initial liquid hypothesis : two phenomena known from the dynamic heterogeneity in the dynamical glass transition are supposed to exist also in an initial liquid before the cosmological inflation : @xmath4 defects ( glarum levy defects ) as seeds for later galaxies , and @xmath5 speckles ( fischer speckles ) claiming the largest causal regions forming a finite universe .",
    "the mathematical tool of the first attempt is the filter @xcite ( section 2 ) .",
    "pedagogically , we may start in the introduction from an euclidean space @xmath6 and ask about the physical use of its points ( @xmath7 ) . in the frame of physical elementarity , these points @xmath7 are to locate ",
    "particles in @xmath6 , e.g. electrons . in quantum theory , the particles have signatures ( charge , spin , parity , ... ) that are taken from the wave function @xmath8 in the neighborhood .",
    "additionally , the particles at @xmath7 have numerical parameters ( mass , coupling constant , weinberg angle ... ) which are not taken from @xmath9 : they are , from the beginning , parameters in the wave equation determining @xmath9 as a function of @xmath7 . in such terms , the difference between mass and energy is physically noted as @xmath10 separation and geometrically as @xmath11 separation .",
    "compare the @xmath11 separation with a general mathematical topological space of a set @xmath6 .",
    "then each point @xmath7 of @xmath6 is connected with a filter @xmath12 ; all the elements of @xmath13 contain the point @xmath7 and are neighborhoods of @xmath14 . _",
    "our physical space is therefore not such a topological space with its identification of neighborhoods and filters _ , because these two get different functions : the wave function @xmath9 belongs to the neighborhood that can not give the parameters of the particle .",
    "these parameters , however , may belong to a filter @xmath15 , whose limit to some culminating point can be the basis for their calculation .",
    "we could e.g. use some kind of a cauchy filter : having elements that can be assigned to arbitrary small diameters needed for a culminating point construction of physical point particles .",
    "we need , therefore , a physical space construction , that distinguishes between the neighborhoods as @xmath9 carriers ( later called tangent objects ) , and the points as culminating points ( whose filters allow the calculation of parameters ) .",
    "this construction excludes the general use of a space manifold with its metric diffeomorphism as e.g. used for the gauge theory prior of the standard model .",
    "the preliminary stage of the above attempts @xcite , of course , does not allow an exact prediction of the parameters for particle astrophysics . in attempt @xcite , only a qualitative , plausible sketch of cosmological development before the primordial stage is tried .",
    "@xmath16 the suggested  hidden charge model  of @xcite ( shortly , the model ) indicates a new theoretical way to the parameters of the standard model for elementary particles , especially to the reason why the model is so as observed .",
    "moreover , the way leads to some consequences beyond the standard model physics .",
    "the stock of particles is strongly restricted , and new phenomena become plausible ( dark matter in @xcite , and primary flatness instead of dark energy , a hadronic inflation , a secondary role of gravitation , and a phenomenological , thermodynamic reason for the desired primordial fluctuations in @xcite ) .    the details and literature of the cosmological revolution can be learned from the reports of the particle data group hagiwara , eidelman , yao2006,particle 4a with their authentic , rational reviews , the methods for the establishment of cosmological parameters from spergel s et al reports @xcite , and the development of cosmology from @xcite .",
    "the main work on the hidden charge model is published before the cosmological revolution : a relevant analysis of the spin statistics theorem @xcite , the hidden charge model @xcite , the construction of tangent objects donth1988 , the analysis of the space problem @xcite , the estimation of some parameters @xcite , and the classification of eigensolutions of the hidden charge @xcite .",
    "a systematic , detailed discussion of the whole construction is in a report @xcite , to be published later .",
    "the mathematics of filters ( @xcite chapter 8 there ) starts from a _",
    "filter basis_. this is a non - empty family @xmath17 of subsets of a set e , if 1 ) the intersection of two subsets belonging to the family @xmath18 also belongs to the family @xmath17 , and 2 ) the empty set does not belong to the family @xmath17 .",
    "examples are a set of rectangles , all containing the point @xmath19 ( figure  1a ) ; or all sets containing twodimensional disks @xmath20 with the center @xmath19 ( figure  1b ) .",

    "]    three remarks should help to sort our physical model into such mathematics :    \\1 .",
    "topological space _ is a set @xmath6 each element @xmath7 ( point @xmath7 ) of which is connected with a filter @xmath13 ; all sets of these filters must contain the point @xmath7 , i.e. they are neighborhoods of the point @xmath7 .",
    "in addition , there is an analogeous condition for the neighborhoods faure1964 .",
    "this filter @xmath13 is called filter of neighborhoods of the point @xmath7 .    \\2 .",
    "be @xmath21 a map of a set @xmath6 into a topological space @xmath5 , and @xmath15 a filter on @xmath6 .",
    "a point @xmath22 is called _ limit of the map _ @xmath23_via the filter _",
    "@xmath13 ( @xmath24 ) if the image @xmath17 of the filter @xmath15 gets its culminating point @xmath25 by the map @xmath23 .",
    "a filter on a separable metric space is called _ cauchy filter _ , if it contains sets of arbitrary small diameters ; a cauchy filter is a converging filter .",
    "a cauchy filter has at most one culminating point .",
    "if it has one , so the filter converges to this point .",
    "filters that are related to the set of complements to natural numbers ( @xmath26 ) are called frchet filters .",
    "a sequence of points ( @xmath27 ) is a cauchy sequence , if for any @xmath28 exists such an integer @xmath29 , that the inequalities @xmath30 , @xmath31 imply the inequality for the distance @xmath32 .",
    "the frchet filter associated with @xmath27 is , therefore , a cauchy filter .",
    "what are the hidden things that connect , in the sense of elementarity , the culminating point @xmath7 with the wave function @xmath9 ? for this purpose , the existence of a hypothetical _ hidden charge _ is assumed ( figure 2 ) : ( 1 ) the hidden charge is an omnipresent compact  electrodynamic  @xmath0 manifold in four dimensions ( geometrically called @xmath33 space ; if completed by an @xmath19 potential : hidden charge ) .",
    "( 2 ) homogeneous wave fields for 1-form @xmath19 potentials on @xmath33 from maxwell s equations ( harmonic potentials ) are assumed . this construction is conformally invariant , i.e. the coordinates are angles and do not have the meaning of lengths and their  wave metric  has no constant @xmath34 in m / s .",

    "( 4 ) culminating points are generated by an existential instability .",
    "the many elements needed for the filters of culminating points come from the @xmath42 segment and are called vacuum elements : @xmath43 ( or @xmath44 ) .",
    "( 5 ) the @xmath19 potentials on the torus coordinates are mapped on the wave functions @xmath9 in the tangent objects , the parameters of the points @xmath7 come from the @xmath45 filter .",
    "( 6 ) the culminating points and their tangent objects form the physical or reality space @xmath46 , the filter belongs to the @xmath47 map .",

    "( a ) . culminating point and tangent object .",
    "feynman fabric of points and connections over tangent objects .",
    "the set of reality @xmath46 space elements \\{points , tangent objects , connections } forms a  crumbled space ",

    "this space is not so  tight  as a manifold .",
    "[ fig2 ] ]    the physical picture resulting from the model is not complicated .",
    "we can use prosy and heuristic _ physical _ arguments : it is not necessary first to be lost in the abyss of deep new mathematics .",
    "the culminating point / tangent object : the @xmath11 separation of the @xmath48 map is illustrated by two methodical steps .",
    "first , the filter of the @xmath45 segment vacuum elements is depicted by a segment cone of the @xmath47 map .",
    "this is e.g. for mass at @xmath7 ( figure 2a ) .",
    "second , motions in the reality space @xmath46 are generated by  rotations ",
    "( invariant vector fields ) of the hidden  @xmath33 space giving @xmath9 .",
    "this leads to dirac phase factors for feynman path integrals of the electroweak interaction .",
    "this is e.g. for energy ( figure 2b , cf . also section 4 ) .",
    "the key question for the @xmath11 separation is : what is the @xmath7 in the wave function @xmath8 , if there is no manifold for @xmath7 ?",
    "we need ( 1 ) some construction , where @xmath7 can get a firm geometric base that would be measurable by e.g. photons .",
    "this is the tangent object around any point @xmath7 .",
    "we need ( 2 ) some construction that defines @xmath9 .",
    "this is the ",
    "feynman fabric  of random points and dirac phases between ( figure 3 ) defining path integrals .",
    "random culminating points and @xmath49 dirac phase factors between .",
    "this fabric is over the tangent objects of the points .",
    "[ fig3 ] ]    remark to the tangent objects ( appendix c ) .",
    "an electrodynamic ( physical ) space structure is separately defined for each tangent object .",
    "the tangent object is an  electrodynamic neighborhood  of each culminating point . a common mathematical minkowski structure for  before  and  after  a particle collision",
    ", however , is not a prior of the hidden charge model .",
    "each physical tangent object can methodically be stratified into layers which contain different physical aspects of the potentials from the different eigensolutions on the @xmath33 space",
    ". examples .",
    "the first layer is an algebraic construction of a biquaternion space @xcite , and the second layer is specified by  physical coordinates  marked by the potential components of the eigenfunctions for different classes .",
    "this results in an electrodynamic minkowski structure @xmath50 for the tangent object for 1-class eigensolutions ( e.g. leptons ) and in a fourdimensional euclidean structure @xmath51 for 2-class eigensolutions ( e.g. dark matter particles or the prebaryon ) .",
    "the common space is a mix of tangent objects with different specification , e.g. a mix of @xmath50 and @xmath51 tangent objects ( crumbled space , section 4.1 ) .",
    "this is not a manifold .",
    "remark to the path integrals ( figure 3 ) : particle collisions result in feynman diagrams from the elements of the feynman fabric over the tangent objects of the particles .",
    "a prior of the conventional gauge - theory approach to the standard model ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 , ... , gut unification ) is based on absolutizing the space _ metric _ : the real space be a manifold with its diffeomorphism for the metric , also for physics without gravitation .",
    "this diffeomorphism would generate a topological space unifying points and filters as neighborhoods .",
    "this would destroy the @xmath11 separation of figure 2 .",
    "the @xmath11 separation maintains the chance of our model to be consistent with the confirmed part of the standard model : 1 ) .",
    "the feynman propagator ( figure 3@xcite ) can do without the diffeomorphism of a mathematical space manifold .",
    "2 ) . electrodynamics ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) and invariant vector fields of a group space need only external differentials @xmath56 for our physical applications .",
    "as mentioned above , the conformal electromagnetic wave metric on @xmath33 ( equation eq.7.1 , below ) has no intrinsic length , but only angles .",
    "the quantum mechanical relation ( from the feynman path integral ) between mass @xmath57 ( e.g. for an exchange boson ) and length @xmath58 , @xmath59 , can do with the mass definition from the culminating point and a length @xmath58 mediated by the tangent objects .",
    "this @xmath59 relation does not need the diffeomorphism .    once again in other words : the massless model photon alone can not define a metric tensor on the tangent object .",
    "nevertheless , electromagnetic properties are essentially used to construct the tangent object ( as discussed in appendix c ) .",
    "the mathematical diffeomorphism corresponds physically to the motion of the model graviton .",
    "this graviton is fundamentally connected to large space scales and is  very weak  ( a shadow with factor 10@xmath60 ) in comparison to the  stronger  electromagnetic properties of our flat @xmath50 tangent object in the empty space.what things",
    "( besides a strong charge symmetry ) can we obtain from the model ?",
    "_ section 3 _ : although there are no particles and no parameters in the hidden charge , we get a simple and clear system of particles in the reality space from the only three classes of eigensolutions .    _",
    "section 4 _ : the conventional electroweak lagrangian in @xmath46 is obtained from the @xmath61 map of the invariant vector fields of @xmath33 . instead of higgs ( no relevant eigensolutions for higgs particles and no energetic cause for mass ) , a mass operator with action on the @xmath45 segment for the filter is detected .",
    "quantum field theory is explicitely obtained via feynman path integrals ; quantum theory seems possible also for 2-class particles with @xmath51 tangent objects , if they are isolated and imbedded in only @xmath62 tangent objects of the crumbled space .    _ section 5 _ : from the filter construction we get numerical values for the weinberg angle @xmath63 , the current coupling constant @xmath64 , and the mass curve of charges leptons ( @xmath65 ) with an existential instability for higher families @xcite .",
    "the existential instability in the whole model comes from the maximum of the mass curve of charged leptons ( figure 6 , below , cf . also figure 2 in donth1988 ) .",
    "existential stability includes that the mass of a corresponding particle in the next family is larger",
    ". an instability would enter , if the mass in the next but one and the following families become smaller . then , a particle in the next family can not exist .",
    "the boundary defines the number of existing charged lepton families ; e.g. @xmath66 would be the last existing , if eka@xmath67 would have a larger mass , but eka@xmath68 successively smaller ones .",
    "existential instability is sharper than the  quantum mechanical one : such particles can not exist even as virtual particles in feynman diagrams .",
    "example : the tauon @xmath66 is quantum - mechanical instable but existentially stable .",
    "the mass operator contains only @xmath69 ( besides a hopf fiber for imbedding the particle point in its tangent object ) .",
    "the filter concerns , therefore , only the @xmath45 segment coordinate .",
    "this coordinate is contained in the harmonic potentials by the  harmonic polynomials ",
    "@xmath70 , @xmath71 , with @xmath72 for charge and @xmath73 the family number ( section 3.2 ) . for the vacuum ( @xmath74 , @xmath75 ) the number of zeros @xmath76 ,",
    "i.e. the size of the segment part is of order @xmath77 .",
    "it is suggested that the convergence of segment parts mediates some kind of a cauchy filter with numbers for @xmath78 vacuum elements . from the polynomials we get huge numbers ( section 3.2 ) that facilitate the handling of the filter convergence for coupling constant and masses .",
    "how get the other particles their masses ?",
    "if they ( as common particles from several eigensolutions , e.g. hadrons , or with @xmath51 tangent objects , e.g. dark matter ) are imbedded in @xmath50 tangent objects of the crumbled space , i expect , seen from outside , similar methods as for charged leptons and , therefore , similar limitations from existential stability .",
    "_ example _ : since the @xmath78 structure of the dark matter particle is similar to the @xmath78 structure for the model electroweak exchange bosons , a dark matter particle gets an estimated mass of order 100 gev .",
    "the @xmath78 structures are : for ( 1,1 ) dark matter @xmath79@xcite , for @xmath80 exchange bosons ( @xmath81 ) , and for the @xmath82 exchange boson @xmath83 .",
    "the two latter structures lead to @xmath84 as expected for the mass ratio of the exchange bosons .",
    "string particles do not have physical elementary as defined in section 1 .",
    "string particles are excitations of ( in the pristine form : onedimensional ) objects consisting of  many  points of a manifold ; the string particles are much larger than the points . in the hidden charge model , however , the particles are elementary points in the reality space , generated by the converging filters of culminating points .",
    "the space points have physical elementarity in the above sense by being possible locations of elementary particles .",
    "in addition , in the string theory , space - time and physics are separated in conventional manner .",
    "the prior of a higher - dimensional riemann - klein - kaluza space - time manifold consistent with physics carries a physical lagrangian and a physical higgs mechanism .",
    "complications by e.g. warping and sequesting the space are accepted in the string community . in the hidden charge model",
    ", the borderline between space - time and physics is complicated from the beginning .",
    "e.g. , the tangent object is not only a geometrical object but is physically motivated and stratified in different layers ( see table 2 in appendix c of section 7 , below ) .",
    "moreover , the number of dimensions for string theory is 10 or 11 , i.e. 6 or 7 of them are compactified , i.e. hidden at small lengths corresponding , in the pristine versions , to high ( planck ) energy : 10@xmath85 fermi and 10@xmath86 gev , respectively .",
    "the hidden charge model remains in four dimensions .",
    "the hidden @xmath33 space is a compact @xmath1 manifold with conformal invariance .",
    "this ensures omnipresence and application ( the map of figure 2 ) to e.g. the very large universe as well as to compton wave lengths of hadrons . the map between @xmath33 space and reality @xmath46 space",
    "is initiated by existential instability for higher particle families .    additionally , the number of eigensolutions in the string theory is usually very large , and the separation of an experimental range ( 1000 gev , say ) is a thankless task . in the hidden charge model ,",
    "the number of particles is restricted by only three classes of eigensolutions , and to low energies due to existential instability , so that a clear picture can be developed from the very beginning .",
    "string theory delegates crumbling of space to the small planck length scale .",
    "the hidden charge model sees a crumbled space from the @xmath11 separation as a general companion for quantum theory in all length scales .",
    "conventional quantum theory ( so far successful for electroweak interaction ) is , as seen from our model , a trial to define the circumstances on the basis of a manifold .",
    "string theory includes not only a unification of electroweak and strong theory at the gut scale ( @xmath87 gev ) , but also the gravitation can be included .",
    "this suggests a  hot  unification at the above planck scale ( 10@xmath88 gev ) and a hot start of the universe .",
    "the hidden charge model , however , allows a cold unification ( @xmath89 gev ) and a cold start , mainly because of the unusual properties of our dark matter particles second part and because a metric diffeomorphism @xmath90 is not assumed as a prior .",
    "the hidden @xmath33 space suits well to electrodynamics .",
    "it has four dimensions and allows a minkowski ( wave ) metric in angles ( though with no @xmath34 constant in meters / second for conformal invariance of wave fields ) .",
    "biharmonic coordinates ( appendix a in section 7 , below ) : @xmath91 with @xmath92 , @xmath93 with @xmath94 , @xmath95 , allow a simple definition of a @xmath96 charge symmetry @xmath97 on the basis of only wave fields ( div@xmath98 @xmath99 ) , reflecting the equivalence of the two heegaard tori in @xmath93 ( figure 7 in appendix b of section 7 , below ) :    @xmath100    the three onedimensional tori 0 ... 2@xmath101 come @xcite from the cartan subalgebra of @xmath102 .",
