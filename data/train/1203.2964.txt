    "since the suggestion of using charmonium suppression as a possible signature for the formation of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) in relativistic heavy - ion collisions  @xcite , there have been many theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite studies on charmonium production in heavy ion collisions at energies available from the super proton synchrotron ( sps ) , the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "although the collision energy spans two orders of magnitude from sps to lhc , the observed suppression of charmonium production in these collisions was found to be similar .",
    "a possible explanation for this surprising result is that the expected larger suppression of charmonium production with increasing collision energy is compensated by the increasing number of regenerated charmonia from initially produced charm and anticharm quarks in qgp .",
    "this is because the number of regenerated charmonia is quadratically proportional to @xcite while that of directly produced charmonia depends linearly on the number of charm quarks  @xcite .",
    "studies based on phenomenological models indeed show that although the fraction of regenerated charmonium is compatible to that of directly produced one in central au+au collisions at rhic , it becomes dominant in central pb+pb collisions at lhc  @xcite as more charm and anticharm quarks are produced .",
    "the charmonia production rate in qgp depends on the charm and anticharm quark distributions in both momentum and coordinate spaces  @xcite .",
    "presently it is not clear to what degree charm and anticharm quarks , which are produced from initial hard collisions with a power law distribution , are thermalized in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "it seems that charm and anticharm quarks of low transverse momentum are close to while those of intermediate and high transverse momenta are far from thermal equilibrium  @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the charm quark nonequilibrium effect on charmonia regeneration in qgp is included by multiplying the expected equilibrium charmonium number by a relaxation factor @xmath0 $ ] with @xmath1 being the relaxation time of charm quarks in qgp .",
    "since the latter has a value @xmath2 , the regeneration contribution to charmonium production is suppressed by a factor of 0.53 , 0.68 and 0.8 in heavy ion collisions at sps , rhic , and lhc , respectively , when the corresponding qgp lifetime is about 3.0 , 4.5 , and 6.5 @xmath3 . to check the accuracy of the estimate based on the relaxation factor",
    ", we calculate in the present study the charmonium production rate using the tsallis distribution for charm and anticharm quarks  @xcite .",
    "the tsallis distribution with a parameter @xmath4 is a generalized boltzmann distribution , which is the same as the normal boltzmann distribution when @xmath5 but becomes a harder power law distribution as the value of @xmath4 increases . in this study , we define @xmath6 and determine its values for the initially produced charm and anticharm quarks from hard collisions at rhic and lhc by fitting the charm quark spectra generated by the event generator phytia  @xcite . to study how the charm and anticharm quarks approach equilibrium in a qgp",
    ", we use the parton cascade model based on their elastic scattering with light quarks and gluons in the qgp . fitting these distributions by the tsallis distribution",
    ", we then calculate the charmonium production rate using the transition amplitude that is calculated up to the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in perturbative qcd ( pqcd )  @xcite .",
    "we find that nonequilibrium charm and anticharm quarks suppress the charmonium production rate compared to that from equilibrated ones and that the suppression factor estimated from the charm quark relaxation time , which has been frequently used in the literature , is close to our results .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",

    "finally , we give the conclusions in sec .  [ conclusions ] . for details on the evaluation of the phase space integral in the charmonium production rate ,",
    "they are given in appendix a.",
    "although the suggestion of @xmath7 suppression as a signature of qgp was based on the idea that the @xmath7 could not be formed in qgp  @xcite due to screening of the color charge , recent studies on the spectral functions of charmonia have suggested , on the other hand , that the dissociation temperature of @xmath7 is higher than the critical temperature for qgp phase transition  @xcite , indicating that the @xmath7 can survive and be regenerated in qgp .    in pqcd ,",
    "the leading - order process for @xmath7 production from charm and anticharm quarks is the reaction @xmath8 .",
    "the transition amplitude for this reaction is same as that for the @xmath7 dissociation reaction @xmath9 given in refs .",

    "the production rate of charmonium with momentum @xmath31 in a qgp from the lo and nlo charm and anticharm quark recombination processes described in the previous section can be written as  @xcite @xmath32 in the above , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are , respectively , the charm and anticharm quark distributions ; @xmath35 is the thermal parton distribution including the degeneracies of quarks due to their flavors and antiparticles ; @xmath36 is the outgoing gluon momentum in the lo @xmath37 reaction ; and @xmath38 is the outgoing parton momentum , while @xmath39 is the outgoing and incoming parton momentum in the nlo @xmath40 and @xmath20 reactions , respectively .     in the tsallis distribution.,width=9 ]    for the charm and anticharm quark distributions , we use the modified tsallis distribution function @xmath41 where @xmath6 with @xmath4 being a parameter in the original tsallis distribution function and @xmath42 , which depends on @xmath43 , is given by @xmath44 to ensure that the integration of @xmath45 over the charm quark momentum gives the charm quark density @xmath46 . in fig .",
    "[ tsallis ] , we show the charm quark distribution for different values of @xmath43 . it is seen that as @xmath43 approaches 0 , @xmath47 becomes the boltzmann distribution .",
    "details on the phase - space integrations in eqs.([beta1 ] ) , ( [ beta2 ] ) , and ( [ beta3 ] ) with the tsallis distribution are given in appendix a.     in qgp at temperatures @xmath48 ( left panel ) and @xmath49 ( right panel ) from charm and anticharm quarks that have a tsallis distribution with various values of @xmath43.,width=9 ]    in fig .",

    "these results are obtained with the density of charm quarks in the qgp taken to be 0.008/@xmath52 ( 1  @xmath53 ) .",
    "it is seen that the momentum dependence of the @xmath7 production rate becomes harder as @xmath43 increases .",
    "this is reasonable because a larger @xmath43 indicates a harder charm quark momentum spectrum .",
    "also , the @xmath7 production rate is larger at 1.5 @xmath50 than at 1.0 @xmath50 , consistent with the larger @xmath7 thermal decay width at higher temperature .     per unit rapidity as a function of @xmath43 at @xmath48 and 1.5 @xmath50 .",
    "dotted , dashed , and dot - dashed lines are from the reactions @xmath8 , @xmath54 , and @xmath40 , respectively , and solid lines are their sum.,width=9 ]    figure  [ yields ] shows the dependence of the momentum integrated @xmath7 production rate per unit rapidity on the parameter @xmath43 for the three reactions @xmath55 ( dotted line ) , @xmath54 ( dashed line ) , and @xmath56 ( dot - dashed line ) . the most dominant process is @xmath20 , especially at high temperature .",
    "the reason for this is that the common factor @xmath57 in the squared transition amplitudes in eq .",
    "( [ lo])@xmath58([gnlo2 ] ) peaks at small relative momentum @xmath59 between charm and anticharm quarks and the value of @xmath59 is smaller in the reaction @xmath20 than in other reactions .",
    "figure  [ yields ] also shows that the @xmath7 production rate from the three reactions behave differently as the value of @xmath43 increases .",
    "since harder charm and anticharm quark spectra are less favorable to @xmath7 production as a result of the large relative momentum between charm and anticharm quarks , the production rate of @xmath7 from the reaction @xmath20 decreases as @xmath43 increases , similar to that found in the coalescence model @xcite .",
    "although the transition amplitudes in all processes favor soft charm and anticharm quark spectra , to produce additional partons in the final state as in the reactions @xmath8 and @xmath40 requires that the initial charm and anticharm quarks to have high energy . as a result , the production rates of @xmath7 from the reactions @xmath8 and @xmath40 increase and then decrease with increasing @xmath43 , particularly from the latter reaction as it has two thermal partons in the final state . the total @xmath7 production rate given by the sum of the production rates from the three reactions decreases , however , with increasing @xmath43 since it is dominated by the reaction @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , nonequilibrium charm and anticharm quark distributions suppress the @xmath7 production rate in qgp compared to that from completely thermalized charm and anticharm quark distributions .",
    "at 0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 times the charm quark relaxation time @xmath60 .",

    "specifically , we take the initial charm and anticharm quark spectra at mid - rapidity ( @xmath62 ) from the phytia simulations  @xcite for p+p collisions at @xmath63 and @xmath64 , available at rhic and lhc , respectively , and they are shown by solid and open circles in panel ( a ) of fig .  [ spectra2 ] . assuming that the charm and anticharm quark spectra are isotropic in momentum space",
    ", we then find that they can be very well described by the tsallis distribution with @xmath65(650  mev ,  0.013 ) and ( 680  mev ,  0.033 ) as shown , respectively , by lines in panel ( a ) of fig .",

    ", we examine the change of their momentum distributions with time .",
    "the results for the two initial charm and anticharm quark spectra corresponding to @xmath63 and @xmath64 in a qgp of temperature @xmath66 are shown by solid and open circles in panels ( b)-(d ) of fig .",
    "[ spectra2 ] for different times of 1@xmath60 , 2@xmath60 , and 3@xmath60 . here",

    "the relaxation time is thus the inverse of drag coefficient of charm quarks  @xcite .",
    "we find from the parton cascade simulation that the relaxation time of charm quarks in a qgp of temperature @xmath49 depends only weakly on their momentum distribution and has an approximate value of about 3.2 fm/@xmath74 . in fig .",
    "[ spectra2 ] , we also show by lines the fitted charm ( anticharm ) quark momentum distributions using the tsallis distribution with the parameters @xmath75=(190  mev ,  0.078 ) , ( 140  mev ,  0.072 ) , and ( 150  mev ,  0.058 ) for the case of rhic and @xmath75=(140  mev ,  0.107 ) , ( 90  mev ,  0.097 ) , and ( 100  mev ,  0.081 ) for the case of lhc at different times of 1@xmath60 , 2@xmath60 , and 3@xmath60 . it is seen that the tsallis distribution again describes very well the charm ( anticharm ) quark distribution from the cascade simulation .",

    "these results show that the suppression of @xmath7 production due to the nonequilibrium charm and anticharm quark distributions is stronger at higher - energy collisions and at higher temperature .",
    "this is due to the fact that the more energetic charm and anticharm quarks produced in higher energy collisions make it harder to produce the charmonium , and that the smaller charmonium binding energy at higher temperature further suppresses its production .",
    "although the suppression starts at different values in different cases , their time dependences all seem to be similar .",
    "since the temperature of qgp formed in relativistic heavy ion collisions decreases with time , the suppression of @xmath7 production due to nonequilibrium charm anticharm quarks would decrease with time as well . for comparison",

    "<S> parameterizing the charm and anticharm quark momentum distributions by the tsallis distribution , we study the nonequilibrium effect on the charmonium production rate in a quark - gluon plasma up to the next - to - leading order in perturbative qcd . </S>",
    "<S> we find that nonequilibrium charm and anticharm quarks suppress the charmonium production rate compared to that from equilibrated ones . </S>",
    "<S> we further show that the suppression factor calculated with the charm quark relaxation time , which has been frequently used in the literature , is close to our results . </S>"
