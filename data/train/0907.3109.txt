    "experiments  @xcite have now confirmed that leptonic flavour is not conserved in nature : the historical observation of neutrino oscillations has changed our picture of fundamental physics . in contrast to the quark sector , neutrino oscillations are characterized by two large mixing angles  @xcite .",
    "it is natural to expect that lepton flavour violation ( lfv ) effects also take place among the electrically charged partners of neutrinos under the weak interaction @xmath3 .",
    "the simplest and well - motivated way to induce neutrino lfv effects is through the exchange of neutral leptons involved in generating neutrino masses via various variants  @xcite of the simplest type - i seesaw  @xcite .",
    "the basic feature of such seesaw picture is that neutrino masses arise only as a result of the exchange of heavy gauge singlet fermions through @xmath4 leading to an effective neutrino mass matrix @xmath5 in the @xmath6 basis , where @xmath7 denote the heavy 21 singlet right - handed neutrino states which are sequentially added to the standard model .",
    "the smallness of neutrino mass follows naturally from the heaviness of @xmath7 .    as an alternative to the simplest type - i seesaw , it has long been proposed that , thanks to the protecting @xmath8 global lepton number symmetry , the exchange of heavy neutral dirac fermions implied by the matrix @xmath9 ( in the basis @xmath10 ) will keep the neutrinos massless and yet allow for lfv effects .",
    "this is the idea behind the so  called inverse seesaw model  @xcite ( for other extended seesaw schemes see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "note that , to each of the isodoublet neutrinos @xmath11 two 21 isosinglets @xmath12 are added  .",
    "neutrinos get masses only when @xmath8 is broken , for example through a nonzero @xmath13 mass term .",
    "thanks to the lepton number symmetry which arises as @xmath14 the magnitude of @xmath15 can be chosen to be small in a natural way , in the sense of t hooft  @xcite . moreover , in specific models , the smallness of @xmath15 may be dynamically preferred  @xcite .",
    "after @xmath8 breaking the effective light neutrino mass matrix is given as @xmath16 so that , when @xmath15 is small , @xmath17 is also small , even when @xmath18 lies at the electroweak scale . in other words ,",
    "the smallness of neutrino masses does not require superheavy physics .",
    "we now turn to simple variants of the above schemes where the 21 singlet fermions @xmath7 are replaced by su(2 ) triplets @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "the minimal type iii seesaw model is described by the lagrangian @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the hyperchargeless isotriplet fermion , @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the standard model higgs scalar doublet .",
    "the effective neutrino mass matrix is fully analogous to eq .",
    "( [ normal ] ) and its smallness requires a very large isotriplet fermion mass .    the charged lepton mass matrix is a @xmath24 matrix , @xmath25 which is brought to diagonal form by a 6  @xmath26  6 unitary matrix @xmath27 of the same dimension , @xmath28 @xmath29 leading to three light fermions , namely @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and three heavy charged fermions @xmath32 with @xmath33 .    in analogy with the matrix describing neutrino",

    "in other words the mixing between different isospins implies the violation of the gim mechanism  @xcite with amplitude of order @xmath41 where @xmath42 .     and",

    "we have estimated the maximum attainable values for ( i ) the tree level lfv z vertex , which also induces the @xmath44 decays , and ( ii ) for the electromagnetic penguin vertices , which induce the radiative lfv decays and @xmath45 conversion . barring fine - tuning , one finds that they are far from the sensitivities expected in the upcoming lfv searches  @xcite . as an example fig .",
    "[ ref : fig1 ] illustrates the expected rates for lfv z - decay process .",
    "similarly lfv processes involving taus are too small .",
    "having discarded normal type - iii seesaw   as an interesting model for lepton flavor violation , we turn instead to an inverse type - iii seesaw variant , characterized generically by the lagrangian    @xmath46    where , as before , @xmath23 denotes the standard model higgs scalar doublet and now @xmath47 is a hyperchargeless scalar @xmath3-triplet , @xmath48 @xmath49 leading to @xmath50 this leads to six heavy states @xmath51 with @xmath52 and an effective three light majorana eigenstates @xmath53 with @xmath33 .",
    "the light effective neutrino mass matrix is similar to that of the inverse seesaw model with isosinglet instead of isotriplets  .",
    "for an alternative inverse seesaw model with two lepton triplets see ref .",
    "@xcite . ] .",
    "@xmath54 the smallness of the parameter @xmath15 may also arise dynamically  @xcite and/or spontaneously in a majoron - like scheme with @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a 21 singlet @xcite . in the latter case , for sufficiently low values of @xmath57 there may be majoron emission effects in neutrinoless double beta decay  @xcite .",
    "note that now the ratio @xmath58 need not be too small to reproduce acceptably small neutrino masses , since the latter vanish in the limit where the parameter @xmath15 goes to zero  @xcite .",
    "the smallness of @xmath15 is not only natural  @xcite but also dynamically preferred in some cases  @xcite .",
    "the smaller the @xmath15 values the larger can be the @xmath59 .",
    "this implies that when the mass of @xmath19 is accesible at lhc , say of the order of tev , one expects relatively large lfv decay rates .",
    "in fact the situation is completely novel with respect to what one is used to , in the sense that lfv as well as cp violation effects survive even in the limit when neutrinos become massless  @xcite @xcite .",
    "clearly now fcnc effects can be naturally enhanced without conflict with the smallness of neutrino masses .",
    "the neutrino mixing angles  @xcite indicated by neutrino oscillation experiments  @xcite should be explained from first principles . here",
    "we consider the possibility of doing so in the framework of the inverse 21 seesaw mechanism . to this end",
    "we adopt the attractive tribimaximal ( tbm ) ansatz for lepton mixing  @xcite @xmath60 which provides a good first approximation to the values indicated by current neutrino oscillation data .    here",
    "we propose a simple @xmath0 flavor symmetry realization of the tbm lepton mixing pattern within the inverse type - iii seesaw scheme .",
    "an @xmath0 realization of the tbm in inverse seesaw has already been studied in @xcite .",
    "recall that @xmath0 is the group of the even permutations of four objects .",
    "such a symmetry was introduced to yield @xmath61 and @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "most recently @xmath0 has also been used to derive @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "the group @xmath0 has 12 elements and is isomorphic to the group of the symmetries of the tetrahedron , with four irreducible representations , three distinct singlets @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 and one triplet @xmath67",

    "we have proposed a new inverted version of type - iii seesaw or equivalently , a new type - iii version of the inverse seesaw mechanism . this way the physics responsible for neutrino masses can lie at low - scale and can be accessible at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , due to : ( i ) the tev  scale neutral fermions having large cross sections at the lhc and ( ii ) the tev  scale neutral fermions inducing large lfv processes due to the low - scale violation of the glashow - iliopoulos - maiani mechanism , which implies potentially large tree - level fcnc involving charged leptons . by assuming an @xmath0-based underlying flavor symmetry we have implemented a tri - bimaximal lepton mixing pattern to account for the observed neutrino oscillation parameters .",
    "we have studied the phenomenology of the resulting lfv decays and given the typical expectations for their magnitude , in addition to discussing the predictions for their relative rates . in fig.[fig : e3vseg ] we give the correlation between the branching of @xmath72 vs the branching of @xmath73 fixing @xmath74 and for different values of @xmath75 .",
    "clearly neutral heavy fermion states can lie at the tev scale and their production cross section at the lhc is enhanced with respect to that expected in type - i inverse seesaw  @xcite",

    "last but not least , given the underlying flavor symmetry predictions these should also take into account the details of flavor physics which will determine the expected decay pattern of the heavy leptons .",
