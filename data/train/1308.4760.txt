    "the x - ray binary cygnus x-1 was discovered in the early days of x - ray astronomy  @xcite , and its compact primary was the first black hole candidate to be established via dynamical observations @xcite .",
    "recently , in three sequential papers on cygnus x-1 , we reported accurate values of the source distance @xmath7 @xcite , black hole mass @xmath8 and orbital inclination angle @xmath9 @xcite , and an extreme value for the black hole s spin parameter , @xmath0 ( @xmath10 ; * ? ? ? * ) with @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the angular momentum of the black hole . ] .",
    "we measured the spin of the black hole by fitting the thermal x - ray continuum spectrum of the accretion disk to the thin - disk model of @xcite .",
    "the key fit parameter is the radius of the inner edge of the accretion disk , which is equivalent to the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit @xmath13 @xcite . in turn",
    ", @xmath14 is directly related to the dimensionless spin parameter @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "the continuum - fitting method of measuring spin is simple : it is strictly analogous to measuring the radius of a star whose flux , temperature and distance are known . by this analogy ,",
    "it is clear that one must have accurate estimates of @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 in order to obtain an accurate estimate of @xmath15 by fitting the x - ray spectrum .",
    "the robustness of the continuum - fitting method is demonstrated by the dozens or hundreds of independent and consistent measurement of spin that have been obtained for several black holes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and through careful consideration of many sources of systematic errors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    herein , using the continuum - fitting method @xcite and precisely the same methodologies that are described in gou et al .",
    "( 2011 ; hereafter gou11 )  but using data of much higher quality  we confirm our conclusion that cygnus x-1 s black hole is a near - extreme kerr hole , a result that has received support via the independent fe - line method of measuring spin ( see section  7.1 ) .",
    "importantly , these new data allow us to obtain a more stringent limit on the spin parameter , namely @xmath2 ( @xmath10 ) .    for reliable application of the continuum - fitting method ,",
    "it is essential that the thermal disk component dominate over the compton power - law component @xcite , which is always present in the spectra of x - ray binaries .",
    "it is by this criterion that the present data are of much higher quality than those analyzed in gou11 , as we now explain .",
    "the strength of the complicating compton component is parameterized by the scattering fraction @xmath5 , which is the fraction of the thermal seed photons that are scattered into the power - law component  @xcite . ideally , @xmath5 is a few percent , while the limit for reliable application of the continuum - fitting method , based on a thorough investigation of two black hole binaries , has been shown to be @xmath16%  @xcite .",
    "the extreme spin reported in gou11 is based on an analysis of the only three spectra of cygnus x-1 that were then available and suitable for measurement of spin via the continuum - fitting method .",
    "one spectrum was marginally within the limit ( @xmath17% ) and the other two were above the limit ( both with @xmath18% ) .",
    "herein , we report on spin results for six new spectra , five of which have much more favorable scattering fractions in the range @xmath1910%-19% .",
    "each of the six spectra individually confirms the spin limit set by gou11 ( @xmath0 at @xmath1 ) .    it is challenging to measure the spin of cygnus x-1 not only because the compton component is always relatively strong for this source ( e.g. , see section 4.3 in * ?",
    "* ) , but also for two additional reasons : ( 1 ) it is essential to have spectral data that span a broad energy range , @xmath20  kev , in order to simultaneously constrain the unusually soft thermal component ( @xmath21  kev ) and the compton power - law and reflected components ( see section  2 and figure  [ fig : third ] in gou11 ) , and such broadband data are rare ; and ( 2 ) the source dwells in its soft state only a small fraction of the time . in mid-2010 , cygnus x-1 again entered the soft state . seizing this opportunity",
    ", we observed the source with _",
    "chandra _ , _ swift _ , _ suzaku _ , and _ rxte _ and obtained the spectra with moderate values of @xmath5 that are mentioned above .",
    "the times of these various observations are indicated by arrows in the x - ray light curve shown in figure  [ fig : first ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  2 we describe the observations and data reduction , and in section  3 the data analysis and our spectral model . presented in sections  4 , 5 and 6",
    "respectively are our results , a discussion of their robustness , and a comprehensive analysis of the errors . in section  7",
    "we first discuss spin results obtained using the fe - line method and then compare cygnus x-1 to two other well - studied persistent black hole systems .",
    "we offer our conclusions in the final section .",
    "in late 2010 and during 2011 , we made the five soft - state observations listed in table  1 using _",
    "chandra _ , _ swift _ , _ suzaku _ and _",
    "rxte_. for the four _ chandra _ and _ swift _ observations , the essential high - energy coverage was provided via simultaneous observations made using the proportional counter array ( pca ) aboard _",
    "rxte_. because _ rxte _ observations are segmented by earth occultations and because we require that the _ rxte _ observations be strictly simultaneous ( with those of _",
    "chandra _ or _ swift _ ) , we chopped the five observations into ten observation intervals , each providing one of the spectra s1s10 that are listed in table  1 . here and throughout , `` spectrum '' refers to a segment of an observation , as schematically defined in table 1 .",
    "while two spectra may be part of a single contiguous observation , any two observations were obtained at disjoint time intervals and correspond to distinct pointings .",
    "we adhere to this language throughout .",
    "observation no .",
    "1 , which corresponds to spectra s1s5 ( table  1 ) , is by far the most important observation because the compton component is relatively faint , much fainter than during observations  25 , and also much fainter than during the three observations reported on in gou11 . for this crucial observation ,",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : second ] the count rates measured by _",
    "rxte _ in 16  s bins and _ chandra _ in 100  s bins .",
    "we now discuss in turn the observations and data reduction procedures for _ chandra _ and _ swift _ , and then for _ rxte _ , which provides the complementary high - energy coverage . in the final subsection",
    ", we discuss observation no .  5 , which was performed solely by _",
    "suzaku _ , with the high - energy coverage provided by _ suzaku _",
    "s hard x - ray detector ( hxd ) .",
    "table  1 gives for each observation basic information including the energy range used in analyzing the data for a given detector , the gross observation times , the effective exposure times , the intensity of the source in crab units , the spectral hardness ( figure  [ fig : first ] ) and the orbital phase of the binary system .",
    "the orbital phase is useful for assessing the likelihood that an observation is affected by absorption dips , which are observed in both the hard and soft states of cygnus x-1 near phase zero ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this key observation ( obsid=12472 ) was obtained in the acis cc mode .",
    "as indicated in figure  [ fig : second ] and discussed above , the observation , which has a total duration of 24  ks , was parceled up into five data segments .",
    "the start and stop times for each data segment , which are given in table 1 , are the same as those for the corresponding _ rxte _ pca observation ( figure  [ fig : second ] ) .",
    "the individual pca observation times range from 1.5  ks to 3.4  ks , while the corresponding _",
    "net exposure times are @xmath22  times shorter ( table  1 ) due to the telemetry saturation .    for this",
    "_ chandra _ observation , as well as for observation no .  2 ( see section 2.2 )",
    ", we ( i ) used the high - energy transmission grating ( hetg ) and the advanced camera for imaging and spectroscopy  ( acis - s ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) ; ( ii ) binned the data to achieve a minimum number of counts per channel of 200 ; and ( iii ) made no allowance for systematic error because the statistical error is completely dominant for all our _ chandra _ data ; e.g. , adding in each channel a systematic error of 1% in quadrature with the statistical error leaves our fit results unchanged .    observing a bright source such as cygnus x-1 is challenging because of the effects of `` pileup , '' i.e. , the arrival of two or more photons in the same or adjacent pixel within a single frame time .",
    "the cc mode has the virtue of a short 2.85  ms frame time that is achieved by continuously transferring the data from the image array to the frame - store array .",
    "while this largely solves the problem of pileup ( see section 5.2.1 ) , it results in the collapse of the 2d image into a 1d image and a consequent loss of information on the spatial distribution of photons ( also see section  2 in gou11 ) .",
    "telemetry limitations are also a consideration in observing a bright source . accordingly",
    ", we only transmitted the data for the high energy grating ( heg ; -1 order ) and medium energy grating ( meg ; + 1 order ) components of the hetg .",
    "we used the standard procedures for extracting the data , which ( apart from the 1.32.0 kev chip gap in the meg spectrum ) were fitted over the energy range 0.88.0  kev .      in reducing these te - mode data ( obsid=13219 )",
    ", we followed the method described by  @xcite while again using the orders of the heg and meg spectra mentioned above .",
    "for the te - mode data we also used the readout `` streak '' spectra located alongside the heg and meg spectra .",
    "we followed the recommended procedures in extracting the streak and background spectra .",
    "although the net exposure times for the two te - mode spectra s6 and s7 are respectively 3.6  ks and 0.9  ks , the effective exposure times for the streak spectra are only about 19.2  s and 5.0  s , respectively . as in gou11",
    ", we used the full 0.510  kev bandwidth for the streak spectra , which has a pileup fraction that is less than 3% over the whole range .",
    "for the heg and meg spectra , we used the energy ranges 0.70.9  kev and 7.010.0  kev and confirmed that the pileup fraction in these energy intervals is less than 5% .",
    "( see section 5.2 for a discussion of pileup effects . )",
    "three _ swift / rxte _ observations were performed on ut october 8 , 24 and 26 .",
    "we disregard the observation of october 24 because the _ rxte _ data were not simultaneous and the source was highly variable during this period .",
    "the wt mode was used to minimize the effects of pileup .",
    "the data were extracted using the procedures outlined in @xcite .",
    "we used for the background region an extraction aperture of @xmath23 pixels and for the source region @xmath24 pixels ( i.e. , 40 pixels along the image strip and 20 pixels transverse to it ; 1 pixel  =  2.36 arcsec ) . despite our use of the wt mode ,",
    "the data are strongly affected by pileup .",
    "pileup is negligible below 100  counts  s@xmath25 and moderate below 300  counts  s@xmath25 @xcite .",
    "however , the count rate exceeded 800 counts  s@xmath25 for all of our observations .",
    "we therefore excluded a @xmath26 pixel region in the center of the source extraction region to ensure that pileup effects are small ( see section 5.2.3 for details ) .",
    "we netted three simultaneous _",
    "swift_+_rxte _ observations ,",
    "each @xmath27  ks in duration ( table  1 ) , that we used to measure spin .",
    "although the gap between the two observations is only @xmath28  min , we chose not to combine them because our model fits show strong source variability , with the source intensity increasing from 0.59 crab to 0.90 crab ( table  1 ) and the scattering fraction increasing from 31% to 50% ( section  3 ) .",
    "we binned all the _ swift _ data to achieve a minimum of 200 counts per channel , and we included a systematic error of 0.5% in the count rates in each pha channel .",
    "as in gou11 , for _ rxte _ we used only the data for pcu2 , which is widely regarded as the best - calibrated detector .",
    "meanwhile , it is unimportant whether one uses pcu2 alone or all the pcus ( gou11 ) .",
    "all the _ rxte _ spectra have been reprocessed using the latest pca calibrations available in nasa software release heasoft 6.13 . in particular , we generated new response files and used the latest assignments for converting pulse - height channel to energy .",
    "in addition , we used a revised pca background model , `` pca_bkgd_cmvle_emv20111129.mdl '' , which we obtained from the pca instrument team .",
    "furthermore , we corrected the effective area of the pca using the  @xcite spectrum of the crab nebula precisely as described in section  2 in gou11 , thereby obtaining for observation  nos .",
    "1/2/3/4 normalization correction factors @xmath29 of 1.128/1.133/1.123/1.123 and power - law slope correction factors @xmath30 0.022/0.024/0.023/0.023 ; the respective dead time correction factors are 1.029/1.039/1.048/1.048 .",
    "finally , as customary for pca observations of bright sources , we included an allowance of 0.5% for systematic error .",
    "we fitted the _",
    "spectra over the energy range 2.950  kev ( pulse - height channels 4 to 83 ) .",
    "both the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ) and the hard x - ray detector ( hxd ) were used for this observation with a gross observing time of @xmath31  ks ( table  1 ) .",
    "we reduced the data using the standard procedures described in @xcite .",
    "there is no fast readout mode for the xis detector , and the effects of pileup are large , even though we excluded the counts in the central source region within a radius of 60 pixels . to achieve an acceptable fit ( @xmath322.0 ) , for the xis we ignored",
    "the energy ranges : 1.71.9 kev and 2.12.3 kev , and for the hxd we ignored the energy range below 20 kev .",
    "we furthermore added the 2% customary systematic error for the xis .",
    "( no systematic error was included for the hxd . ) given ( 1 ) that the fit we were able to achieve is relatively poor with @xmath33 , ( 2 ) the lack of any constraint on the reflection component in the 1020  kev band , and ( 3 ) the significant effects of pileup we do not use the _ suzaku _ spectrum to estimate spin , although for completeness we list the observation in table  1 .",
    "a soft - state spectrum of cygnus x-1 consists of thermal , power - law and reflected components , which are illustrated in figure  [ fig : third ] .",
    "the latter component includes the fe  k@xmath34 emission line .",
    "a schematic sketch of the physical structures that generate the three spectral components , namely the accretion disk and the corona , are shown in figure  2 in gou11 .",
    "the spectral fitting package xspec ] version 12.6.0 @xcite was used for all data analysis and model fitting . unless otherwise indicated , the error on a single parameter is reported at the @xmath35 ( 68.3% ) level of confidence . in this section and the one that follows ,",
    "the input parameters @xmath7 , @xmath9 and @xmath8 are fixed at their fiducial values ( see section  4 ) .    in gou 11",
    ", we analyzed three spectra of cygnus x-1 using a progression of seven preliminary models .",
    "the first three models , nr1nr3 , were nonrelativistic , with the accretion disk component modeled using diskbb .",
    "the results for the physically most realistic of these models , nr3 , were adopted .",
    "we obtained consistent values of inner - disk temperature and radius for the three spectra , which are reported in table  7 in gou11 : @xmath36 , and @xmath37 ( std .",
    "dev . ; n=3 ) .",
    "next , we analyzed the spectra using four preliminary relativistic models , r1r4 .",
    "the principal component of these models is kerrbb2  @xcite , which is a fully relativistic model of a thin accretion disk . like diskbb , kerrbb2 returns two fit parameters , @xmath15 and the mass accretion rate @xmath38 ( instead of @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) .",
    "the models r1r4 progress toward our adopted model , where r1 is the most primitive model . the four models and our adopted model all gave very similar results for the key parameter @xmath15 . in gou11",
    ", we presented a full set of results for models r1r4 to show clearly that our results for the spin parameter are insensitive to the analysis details , as expected given the dominance of the thermal component .    in this paper",
    ", we employ a single model , namely the one adopted in gou11 , which is the most physically realistic of the eight models considered by gou11 .",

    "the fit returns a single value of @xmath15 , a key parameter that appears in kerrbb2 , kerrdisk and kerrconv .",
    "we now discuss the principal components of the model ( thermal , power - law and reflected ) and their relationships .",

    "the effects of spectral hardening are incorporated into the basic model kerrbb via a pair of look - up tables for the hardening factor @xmath42 corresponding to two representative values of the viscosity parameter : @xmath43 and 0.1 ( for details , see  @xcite ) . throughout this work we use @xmath44 unless stated otherwise  @xcite . as noted earlier ,",
    "the two fit parameters of kerrbb2 are @xmath15 and @xmath38 , which along with @xmath8 determine the eddington - scaled bolometric luminosity of the disk , @xmath45 . as in gou11",
    ", we turn on the effects of returning radiation and limb darkening , set the torque at the inner disk radius to zero , fix the normalization to unity , allow @xmath38 to vary freely , and fit directly for @xmath15 .",
    "_ power - law component : _ the term simplr@xmath46kerrbb2 models the power - law plus the observed thermal component .",
    "simplr  @xcite has the same two parameters as its parent model simpl  @xcite : the power - law photon index @xmath47 and the scattered fraction @xmath5 .",
    "however , simplr has one additional parameter , namely , the fraction of the power - law photons that strike the disk . in this application , simplr models a corona that scatters half the thermal seed photons outward and the remainder downward toward the disk , thereby generating the reflected component .    _",
    "reflected component _ : the remaining two additive terms inside the square brackets model the reflected component .",
    "simplc , which is the isolated compton component that illuminates the disk , is equivalent to simplr@xmath46kerrbb2 minus the unscattered portion of the thermal component  @xcite .",
    "the reflected spectrum generated by ireflect acting on simplc contains numerous sharp absorption features but no emission lines .",
    "we supplement this partial reflection model by employing the line model kerrdisk and the convolution smearing model kerrconv  @xcite .",
    "we model the emissivity profile as a single power law with index @xmath48 , and tie together all the common parameters of these two models , including the two principal parameters @xmath15 and @xmath48 .",
    "( for further details concerning assumed values of elemental abundances , disk temperature , etc . , see gou11 ) .",
    "the three multiplicative model components are ( 1 ) crabcor , which corrects for calibration deviations relative to toor & seward  ( see section  2 in gou11 and * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; ( 2 ) const , which allows for discrepancies in the calibrations of the various detectors ( the normalization of the _ rxte_/pcu2 detector is fixed to unity and the normalizations of the _ chandra _ and _ swift _ detectors are allowed to float ) ; and ( 3 ) tbabs a standard low - energy absorption model  @xcite .    comparing figure  [ fig : third ] with the corresponding figure  3 in gou11 , one sees at a glance that spectra s1s5 ( with @xmath49% ) are much more strongly disk - dominated than spectra sp1sp3 in gou11 ( with @xmath3% ) . for spectra s1s5 ,",
    "the peak flux in the thermal component is 510 times the peak flux in the power - law component , and it is @xmath50 times the peak flux in the reflected component .",
    "in this section , we present results with the key input parameters fixed at their fiducial values : @xmath51  kpc , @xmath52 , and @xmath53  deg  @xcite .",
    "the fit results for all ten spectra , s1s10 , are summarized in tables 2 and 3 .    before broadly discussing the results , we focus on the value of the scattering fraction , @xmath5 ( tables  2 and 3 ) , and we strictly follow the data selection criterion @xmath54%  @xcite . therefore",
    ", we henceforth consider only the six spectra s1s6 for which @xmath55% , and we disregard the remaining spectra ( s7s10 ) .    before focusing solely on spectra s1s6 , however , we note that the results for the rejected spectra are , in detail , consistent with those of the selected spectra .",
    "the most notable difference is the depressed value of @xmath15 for s7 ( 0.972 vs.  0.999 for the other nine spectra ) ; but note the poor fit achieved for s7 ( @xmath56/dof@xmath57 vs.  a mean value of 1.11 for s1s6 ) .",
    "meanwhile , a comparison of the mean values of the parameters for spectra s1s6 with their corresponding mean values for spectra s7s10 shows that in most cases the mean values differ by @xmath58% ( tables  2 and 3 ) .",
    "the two notable exceptions ( apart from of course the scattering fraction ) are the steeper power - law slope ( @xmath59 and significantly weaker fe line for the four rejected spectra .",
    "finally , we note that the values of @xmath5 for three of the rejected spectra ( s7 , s8 and s10 ) are very nearly the same as for the two inferior spectra used in gou11 ( sp2 and sp3 ) , namely @xmath60% .",
    "we now direct our attention hereafter solely to spectra s1s6 with values of @xmath61% .",
    "the fits are all good , with @xmath62/dof ranging for s1 from 0.95/628 to 1.40/491 for s6 .",
    "the spin parameter is very high and is pegged at the @xmath63 limit of the kerrbb2 model  @xcite , which is the principal result of this section .",
    "the luminosity of the disk component is low and uniform , @xmath64% , and it easily meets a key data selection criterion for successful application of the continuum - fitting method , namely @xmath65%  @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , the disk is expected to be geometrically thin at all radii  ( @xmath66 ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . meanwhile , the spectral hardening factor @xmath42 is well determined ( @xmath67 ) because the disk luminosity is sufficiently high .",
    "the column density is statistically well determined with uncertainties of only 12% , , @xmath68 , agrees very well with the values derived from the 21-cm line in the direction of cygnus x-1 , which is @xmath69 , a weighted average from both lab and dl maps  @xcite . ] while it varies by 3.3% ( std.deviation ; n=6 ) .",
    "the variability is unsurprising since @xmath70 varies by several percent for all three well - studied supergiant black - hole binaries : m33 x-7  @xcite , cygnus x-1  @xcite , and lmc x-1  @xcite .",

    "in gou11 , we discuss many factors that might affect our principal result , namely the extreme spin of cygnus x-1 ; we find that none of them are significant . here , we review these matters briefly . for further details , see sections 5 and 7 in gou11 , and also see section 5 in @xcite . sections 5.5 and 5.6 below are wholly new and discuss our adopted reflection model in relation to the recently - released reflection model xillver @xcite .",

    "the effects of this approximation on spin measurements have been quantitatively investigated via general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic ( grmhd ) simulations of thin disks by several authors  @xcite .",
    "the general consensus is that the zero - torque approximation introduces uncertainties in spin estimates of around @xmath74 for low spin values ( @xmath75 ) and much smaller errors as @xmath76 .",
    "these error estimates , which are for geometrically thin disks ( @xmath77 , or @xmath78 ) are in practice less than the observational errors in the parameters @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 . for more details concerning",
    "the novikov - thorne model and a discussion of other sources of model errors , see section 5 in @xcite .",
    "we estimated the pileup fraction for each spectrum from eqn . 2 in the _ chandra _ abc guide to pileup using the observed photon flux as the input .",
    "there can be no clear - cut prescription for what level of pileup is acceptable because its effects depend in complex ways on detector performance and science goals .",
    "the guideline on pileup for _ chandra _ data stated in the chandra proposer s observatory guide ( section 6.15.12 ) is : `` if one s scientific objective demands precise flux calibration , then the pileup fraction should probably be kept well below 10% . ''",
    "a specific concern for this paper is that pileup effects , which tend to harden a continuum spectrum , might significantly boost the value of the spin parameter .",
    "we find this not to be the case , as we now discuss .",
    "for the five cc - mode spectra ( s1s5 ) , the effects of pileup are small , @xmath79% over the full fitting range of 0.88.0 kev ( figure  [ fig : forth ] ) , because of the gratings and the nominal 2.85  ms frame time .",
    "we nevertheless made two tests to assess the effects of pileup , both of which show that they are negligible .",
    "first , we refitted the five spectra ignoring the _ chandra _ data above 2.0 kev ( i.e. , the data that determine @xmath47 ) , and we found that the values of the key parameter , @xmath15 , remained unchanged and pegged at the physical limit , while @xmath47 and the scattering fraction in all cases changed by less than 1.1% and 4.0% , respectively . the small change in @xmath47 is as expected , since the number of _",
    "chandra _ counts in the spectrum above 2  kev is only @xmath80% of the _ rxte _ counts .",
    "secondly , we performed a marx simulation to quantitatively estimate how the pileup fraction affects the power - law component for a single _ chandra _ spectrum ( i.e. , excluding its companion _ rxte _ spectrum ) . because marx does not support the cc mode we relied on simulations of te - mode data .",
    "we simulated a parent te - mode spectrum using parameters that describe a typical cygnus x-1 spectrum .",
    "we then used the simulated spectrum to generate four fake spectra with pileup fractions ( at peak flux ) of 1.5% , 3% , 5% and 10% .",
    "we fitted these spectra using our nonrelativistic model nr3 ( gou11 ; the power - law component is poorly constrained for the relativisitc model ) , excluding in this case the reflection component pexriv , and we compared the results to the results obtained by fitting the parent spectrum ( @xmath81 , @xmath5=0.187 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 ) . the photon index @xmath47 increased respectively by 0.8% , 2.2% , 2.1% and 6.4% , and the fractional change in the scattering fraction was 6.7% , 15% , 22% , 59% .",
    "meanwhile , concerning the thermal component , the disk temperature decreased respectively by 0.1% , 0.5% , 0.3% and 2.3% , while the corresponding normalization constant decreased by 2.2% , 3.6% , 8.1% and 9.9% . because @xmath40 is proportional to the square root of the disk normalization , the fractional change in @xmath40 is even smaller , decreasing respectively by 1.1% , 1.8% , 4% , and 5% .",
    "we conclude therefore that the spin is likely to be only very moderately overestimated .",
    "these results give reasonable assurance that our fit results ( tables 2 and 3 ) are negligibly affected by pileup , given that the peak pileup fraction for the five cc - mode spectra is @xmath79% and for the te - mode streak spectrum is @xmath84% ( see below ) .",
    "our two te - mode spectra ( s6 and s7 ) suffer more than the cc - mode spectra from the effects of pileup , especially the heg and meg components of the spectrum .",
    "we estimated the pileup fraction using the kernel pileup in isis , whose mathematical formulation is also eqn .  2 in the _ chandra _ abc guide to pielup .",
    "the pileup fraction for the streak spectrum is @xmath84% over our entire fitting range of 0.510  kev . in order to ensure a pileup fraction of @xmath85% for the meg and heg spectra , we only used data in two restricted energy ranges : 0.70.9  kev and 7.010.0  kev . as a test for the effects of pileup , we refitted spectrum s6 excluding the meg and heg data .",
    "the largest effect on the fit parameters was an @xmath86 change in the column density , which decreased from @xmath87 to @xmath88 .",
    "the changes in the best - fit values of the other parameters are much less than 1% .",
    "the three xrt wt - mode spectra ( s8s10 ) have the same format as the _ chandra _ cc - mode spectra ; i.e. , they are collapsed one - dimensional strips rather than images .",
    "we reduced the effects of pileup by excluding the central @xmath26-pixel region ( i.e. , a 20-pixel - wide swath extending 15 pixels along the image strip ) , a choice validated by @xcite .",
    "these authors performed pileup tests with the excluded region ranging from 0 pixels to 15 pixels ( i.e. , from 0@xmath8920  pixels to 15@xmath8920 pixels ) and for five levels of source intensity .",
    "they found no pileup effects ( i.e. , spectral distortion ) for count rates in the range 0100 counts  s@xmath25 , and only moderate effects in the range 100300 counts  s@xmath25 . in our case",
    ", we therefore expect minimal pileup effects because our count rate ( with the central region excluded ) is only @xmath90  counts  s@xmath25 after the exclusion .",
    "nevertheless , we performed one additional test : we refitted spectrum s8 ignoring the xrt data above 3 kev ( while fitting jointly with the _ rxte _ data , as before ) and found our fit results to be the same as those reported in table  3 .      in gou11 , we showed that the fe line and other reflection features in soft - state spectra of cygnus x-1 are cosmetic and have a negligible effect on the continuum - fitting measurement of spin .",
    "specifically , we refitted the three spectra considered in gou11 excluding the 5.0 - 10.0 kev band and the fe - line component kerrdisk .",
    "this removed the energy range covering the fe k@xmath34 line and edge as well as a feature in the residuals near 9  kev .. ] we found that our spin results were essentially unchanged , as expected given the modest equivalent widths of these features and the relative faintness of the reflected component ( see section  5.6 and figure  3 ) .      in section  5.2 of gou11",
    ", we showed that the energy coverage of the pca , which extends to 45  kev , is sufficient to adequately constrain both the power - law and reflection components .",
    "we did this by refitting one spectrum including _ rxte _ hexte data , which cover the range 20 kev to 150 kev .",
    "this result is not surprising since coverage to 45 kev is more than adequate to determine the power - law component and the reflection component is decreasing rapidly at 45  kev ( figure  3 ) .      as in section 5.3 in gou11",
    ", we replaced our reflection component kerrconv@xmath46ireflect@xmath46simplc+kerrdisk with kerrconv@xmath46reflionx  @xcite , which is widely used in measuring spin via the fe  k@xmath34 line .",
    "as in gou11 , we again find that the effects on the spin parameter are essentially nil .",
    "more recently , a new and improved reflection model xillver has become available @xcite .",
    "this version of xillver  ( like reflionx ) is intended for use when the thermal disk flux is faint compared to the incident power - law flux , and it is therefore not well - suited to our case .",
    "nevertheless , as with reflionx , we performed a test by replacing our reflection component with kerrconv@xmath46xillver .",
    "the fits are poorer with reduced chi - square ranging from 1.9 to 2.2 for s1-s5 , but the effects on the spin parameter were again found to be negligible ( less than 0.2% ) .      in computing the reflected component , we rely on ireflect , which generates a spectrum containing sharp absorption features and no emission lines .",
    "figure 20 in @xcite shows that ( ignoring line emission ) ireflect / pexriv is a good approximation to the sophisticated model xillver at low ionization , @xmath91 ( left panel ) , while it is a very poor approximation at high ionization , @xmath92 ( right panel ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : fifth ] , we show that for an intermediate case , @xmath93 , which corresponds to the moderately ionized disk of cygnus x-1 ( see tables 2 and 3 ) , ireflect / pexriv is in reasonable agreement with xillver . considering further that the peak reflected flux is @xmath50 times fainter than the peak thermal flux ( figure  [ fig : third ] ) , it is not surprising that our estimate of spin is insensitive to the choice of reflection model .",
    "in all the fits we have fixed the disk temperature in the reflection model at @xmath94 k , which corresponds to 0.52 kev .",
    "the disk temperature is quite constant at this value for spectra s1-s6 and the three spectra in gou11 ( see section 3 ) .",
    "meanwhile , increasing the disk temperature by 50% to @xmath95  k or halving it has a negligible effect on the spin and other key parameters ( apart from the ionization parameter ) .",
    "reanalyzing the data using @xmath43 instead of our adopted value of @xmath44 has a very slight effect on our results , and doing so only increases the already extreme value of spin .",
    "the effects of varying metallicity are likewise very small , whether one grossly decreases its value to a tenth solar or considers the suprasolar values implied by the ireflect fits ( tables  1 and 2 ) . in the former / latter case ,",
    "the spin is depressed / increased , but only very slightly ( see section 5.4 in gou11 ) .",
    "an analysis of high resolution optical spectra of the donor star indicates that fe is somewhat overabundant relative to solar @xcite .      in determining the spins of supermassive black holes via the fe  k@xmath34 method ,",
    "careful modeling of absorption by intervening warm gas is usually crucial ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , we have shown , via a continuum - fitting analysis of _ chandra _ hetg spectra , that the effect of warm absorbers is unimportant in estimating the spin of cygnus x-1 ( see section  7.6 in gou11 ) .",
    "the dust scattering halo of cygnus x-1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has an effect on the source spectrum that is equivalent to direct absorption . in order to assess the effects of dust scattering on our results",
    ", we used the only relevant model that is presently available in xspec , namely dust .",
    "the model assumes that the source flux is scattered into a uniform disk whose size and total flux vary respectively as @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the simple model dust is a good approximation to more accurate models ( e.g. , weingartner & draine 2001 ) at energies in the bandpass of interest , namely @xmath98  kev ( table  1 ) .",
    "we reanalyzed spectra s1s5 as before , but this time we included the multiplicative model component dust .",
    "the model has two parameters that specify at 1 kev ( 1 ) the fraction of photons scattered by dust grains , and ( 2 ) the size of the halo in units of the detector beam size .",
    "if both parameters are allowed to vary , neither can be constrained .",
    "we therefore initially fixed the scattering parameter to 0.17 , which was obtained by extrapolating the value 0.12 at 1.2 kev given by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their figure 10 ) .",
    "the results obtained for the key parameters @xmath15 and @xmath5 for each of the five spectra are essentially identical to those that appear in table 2 , although the column density @xmath70 is reduced by @xmath99% .",
    "even if one increases the dust scattering parameter from 0.17 to 0.3 , the values of @xmath15 and @xmath5 are essentially unchanged , while in this case @xmath70 is reduced by @xmath50% .",
    "we conclude that the effects of dust scattering are unimportant .      in section 7.4 in gou11",
    ", we considered a principal source of uncertainty in the continuum - fitting method , namely , whether the black hole s spin axis and the inner disk will align with the orbital plane . if , as some evidence suggests , the persistent supergiant systems are formed by direct , kickless collapse  @xcite , then spin - orbit alignment would be expected for these systems .",
    "( for full discussions on the topic of spin - orbit alignment , see section  1 in @xcite , and section  5.4 in  @xcite ) . in any case",
    ", as we demonstrate for cygnus x-1 in figure  5 in gou11 , even for a misalignment angle as large as , e.g. , 16  deg the spin parameter is still @xmath1000.95 ( ignoring the uncertainties in @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) .",
    "the dominant error in all continuum - fitting measurements of spin is attributable to the observational uncertainties in the source distance , black hole mass and disk inclination . for cygnus x-1 ,",
    "we have determined accurate values for these quantities : @xmath101  kpc @xcite , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 deg @xcite .",
    "quite generally , even the uncertainties in the analytic novikov - thorne model are significantly less important than the uncertainties in @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , as has been shown via grmhd simulations of thin accretion disks ( section  5.1 ) .",
    "the model errors in the case of cygnus x-1 are very small because the black hole s spin is extreme and the disk s luminosity is low , only @xmath104% of the eddington limit . @xcite",
    "have shown via a detailed analysis that for an inclination of 30 deg ( closely approximating cygnus x-1 s 27  deg inclination ) the novikov - thorne model overestimates the spin parameter by only @xmath105 for spin parameters in the range 0.900.98 .    the contribution to the uncertainty in the spin of cygnus x-1 due to",
    "the uncertainty in the absolute calibration of the flux is about the same as that due to the 6% uncertainty in the distance .",
    "we therefore include in our error budget a 10% uncertainty in flux @xcite by inflating the uncertainty in @xmath7 by the method described in gou11 .",
    "the final error we report for @xmath15 therefore includes the uncertainty in the absolute flux calibration as well as the uncertainties in @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "collectively , the uncertainties in these four quantities completely dominate the error budget .",
    "( other , smaller sources of error are discussed in detail in appendix a and section 5 in @xcite , and section 5 in @xcite ) .",
    "following precisely the same procedures described in section 6 of gou11 , we determined the error in @xmath15 due to the the combined uncertainties in @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 via monte carlo simulations .",
    "figure  [ fig : sixth ] shows the resultant spin histograms for our six spectra and displays for each spectrum the corresponding lower limits on @xmath15 at a @xmath1 level of confidence .",
    "were we to use these six limits to derive a joint constraint on spin , it would be more stringent than any one of the individual limits . we choose instead the conservative approach of adopting the most constraining _ single _",
    "limit for our final result , namely , the limit for spectrum s3 .",
    "_ we therefore conclude that @xmath2 at the @xmath1 level of confidence _ obtained for sp1 as our final result because it was the only one of the three spectra whose scattering fraction was @xmath106% . ] .",
    "we note the following two caveats : first , we assume that the spin of the black hole is approximately aligned with the angular momentum vector of the binary ( section 5.10 ) .",
    "second , we assume that the asynchronous dynamical model is correct ( see section  7.3 in gou11 ) .",
    "we first discuss three spin estimates for cygnus x-1 made using the fe - line method , which provide support for an extreme value of spin .",
    "we then relate cygnus x-1 to the other members of its distinctive class of black - hole x - ray sources that are persistently bright .",
    "three recent measurements of the spin of cygnus x-1 obtained using x - ray reflection spectroscopy , aka the fe line method  @xcite , support a high or extreme value of spin .",
    "@xcite report @xmath107 .",
    "their provisional result is based on an analysis of a single simultaneous observation made using _ xmm - newton _ and _ rxte_. a limitation of their result is that it depends on assuming a single , fixed value of 3 for the emissivity index @xmath48 , which is a canonical value .",
    "that is , they assume that the intensity of the flux irradiating the disk varies with radius as @xmath108 . when they allow @xmath48 to vary freely , both the spin parameter and emissivity index are poorly constrained ( see their table  1 ) . in short ,",
    "their data are unable to determine both the profile of the illuminating radiation and the spin .",
    "the result of @xcite is superseded by that of  @xcite who report @xmath109 .",
    "this result is based on an analysis of a single hard - state _ suzaku _ spectrum .",
    "fabian et al .",
    "describe this spectrum as `` an average data set '' ( from a collection of 20 similar spectra ) and report that consistent results were obtained for other data sets .",
    "the fit over a 1500  kev band gives precise results for a 3-parameter , broken power - law model of the radial profile of the irradiating flux : inside the break radius ( @xmath110  @xmath111 ) , @xmath112 , and outside @xmath113 .",
    "most recently , @xcite fitted the fe - k@xmath34 line using _ suzaku _ and _ nustar _ data .",
    "cygnus x-1 was in the soft state .",
    "their best - fitting model gives @xmath114  ( 90% confidence level ) and all the models that provided a good fit to the spectrum indicate a rapidly rotating bh with @xmath115 .    a strength of this work relative to prior studies of cyg x-1 s spin ( including our first paper , gou11 ) is the considerable attention we give here to assessing the effects of a wide range of systematic errors . in doing so , and from a wider breadth of data , our work supplies the strongest evidence for cyg x-1 s extreme spin , confirming the prior leading measurements by gou11 and @xcite .",
    "earlier , @xcite reported a near - zero spin for cygnus x-1 , @xmath116 , based on an analysis of two _ xmm - newton _ spectra .",
    "neither @xcite nor @xcite offer an explanation for this glaring discrepancy .",
    "however , recently an explanation was suggested for the near - zero spin reported by miller et al .  in terms of pileup effects  ( see section 4.3 in * ? ? ?",
    "this example shows that measurements of spin in the literature can be grossly affected by systematic effects , which should be carefully considered in assessing the reliability of spin results .",
    "there are five dynamically established black - hole binaries containing wind - fed black holes and o - supergiant or wolf - rayet companions @xcite ; these systems are persistently x - ray bright . in the following",
    ", we do not consider the two systems with wolf - rayet companions , ic 10 x-1 and ngc 300 x-1 , because the masses of their black holes are very uncertain and their spins have not been estimated . by contrast , the three remaining systems ",
    "cygnus x-1 , lmc x-1 and m33 x-7  have well - determined values of both mass and spin . these fundamental data , which provide a _",
    "complete _ description of these three black holes , appear in the two leftmost columns of table  4 .",
    "while acknowledging that the sample is small , it appears that wind - fed black holes with supergiant companions are restricted to high spin , @xmath117 , in contrast with the broad distribution of spins observed for roche - lobe - fed black holes with low or intermediate mass companions : four of them have low spins , @xmath118 , two have high spins , @xmath119 , and one has an extreme spin , @xmath0  ( see table  1 in * ? ? ?",
    "not only are the persistent black holes all rapidly spinning , they are also relatively massive , @xmath120 ( table  4 ) . by comparison , the masses of the transient black holes are significantly lower , and their mass distribution is remarkably narrow : @xmath121  @xcite .",
    "the data in table  4 highlight a sharp and well - known distinction between the persistent systems and the transient systems , namely that the secondary stars in the former are far more massive , @xmath122 ( table  4 ) ; they likewise have much higher temperatures , @xmath123  k  @xcite .",
    "the masses and temperatures of the secondaries in the transient systems are typically @xmath124 and @xmath125  k ; even in exceptional cases , their masses and temperatures are only @xmath126 and @xmath127  k  @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that for the persistent systems the radii of the secondaries and orbital periods fall in quite narrow ranges ( table  4 ) , while the radii and periods for the transient systems are very broadly distributed , a distinction that is elegantly illustrated in jerome orosz s schematic sketch of 21 black hole binaries  ( see figure  1 in * ? ? ?",
    "the persistent black holes were very likely born with their high spins because their host systems are too young for the black holes to have had time to spin up via accretion torques ( see section 7.7 in gou11 for details ) .",
    "the ages of cygnus x-1 , lmc x-1 and m33 x-7 are @xmath128  million years , whereas the spin - up times are @xmath129  million years if one assumes the maximum , eddington - limited accretion rate .",
    "meanwhile , the spin - up times are likely much longer than 17 million years given that the systems are presently radiating at only @xmath130% of the eddington luminosity ( table  4 ) .",
    "the rotational energy of the persistent black holes is enormous , @xmath131 for m33 x-7 and lmc x-1 @xmath132 for cygnus x-1  @xcite billion year lifetime the energy radiated by the sun is @xmath133 . ] .",
    "correspondingly , a substantial fraction of the gravitational mass of these black holes is attributable to their rotational energy : @xmath134% for m33 x-7 and lmc x-1 and @xmath135% for cygnus x-1 .",
    "in gou11 , while considering a wide range of systematic effects , including uncertainties in the novikov - thorne disk model , we concluded that the spin of the black hole in cygnus x-1 is extreme : @xmath0  ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the result was potentially biased by the relatively strong compton component of emission , the strength of which can be characterized by the fraction @xmath5 of seed photons that are scattered into the power - law component .",
    "the three spectra analyzed in gou11 have @xmath136% , while @xmath137% is the upper limit for reliable application of the continuum - fitting method @xcite .",
    "subsequently , @xcite employed the independent fe - line method and confirmed that the spin of cygnus x-1 is @xmath0  ( @xmath35 ) ; however , this result is less certain because systematic effects in the model have not been assessed .",
    "herein , we present a continuum - fitting analysis of six additional spectra , each of which confirms that @xmath0  ( @xmath1 ) . this confirmation is compelling first because sources of systematic error have been thoroughly addressed  ( see section 5 herein ; sections 57 in gou11 ; *",
    "secondly , and crucially , five of the spectra , s1s5 , are only moderately comptonized with scattering fractions @xmath138 , a regime where it has been firmly established that continuum - fitting results are reliable .",
    "this conclusion is based on studies of two black holes : ( i ) 33 spectra of h1743322 with @xmath139% ( in the spl state ) each gave spins consistent with those obtained for dozens of thermal - state spectra ( @xmath140% ;  @xcite ) ; and ( ii ) 25 spectra of xte j1550564 with @xmath141% each likewise gave spins consistent with those obtained for dozens of thermal - state spectra ( @xmath142% ;  @xcite ) . in short , these two studies show that moderately comptonized spectra with @xmath143 , like s1s5 , give the same values of spin as spectra that are strongly disk - dominated with @xmath144 .",
    "our bottom line is that new and more reliable continuum spectra confirm the findings of gou11 while establishing an even more stringent limit on the extreme spin of cygnus x-1 s black hole : @xmath2 at a confidence level of @xmath1 ( 99.7% ) .",

    "<S> in gou et al .  ( 2011 ) , we reported that the black hole primary in the x - ray binary cygnus x-1 is a near - extreme kerr black hole with a spin parameter @xmath0  ( @xmath1 ) . </S>",

    "<S> . the earlier work , which was based on an analysis of all three useful spectra that were then available , was possibly biased by the presence in these spectra of a relatively strong compton power - law component : the fraction of the thermal seed photons scattered into the power law was @xmath3% , while the upper limit for reliable application of the continuum - fitting method is @xmath4% . </S>",
    "<S> we have subsequently obtained six additional spectra of cygnus x-1 suitable for the measurement of spin . </S>",
    "<S> five of these spectra are of high quality with @xmath5 in the range 10% to 19% , a regime where the continuum - fitting method has been shown to deliver reliable results . </S>",
    "<S> individually , the six spectra give lower limits on the spin parameter that range from @xmath0 to @xmath6 , allowing us to conservatively conclude that the spin of the black hole is @xmath2 ( @xmath1 ) . </S>"
