    "fairall  9 is a bright , nearby ( @xmath9 ) seyfert  1 galaxy that has been the subject of several studies that attempt , using x - ray spectroscopy , to obtain robust measurements of the angular momentum , or spin , of the putative supermassive central black hole ( schmoll et al .",
    "2009 ; emmanoulopoulos et al . 2011 ; patrick et al .",
    "2011a , 2011b , 2013 ; lohfink et al . 2012a ; walton et al . 2013 ; lohfink et al .",
    "according to the `` no hair '' theorem , black holes have only three measurable physical attributes , one of these being spin ( mass and charge being the other two ) .",
    "in addition to its importance for fundamental physics , black - hole spin affects the energetics and evolution of the environment in which the black hole resides .",
    "thus , the spin properties of black holes in a population of sources , such as active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , could provide clues pertaining to the formation and growth of supermassive black holes ( e.g. see volonteri & begelman 2010 ) .",
    "the reason why fairall  9 has been of particular interest for black - hole spin measurements via x - ray spectroscopy is that it is a member of a subset of agn that have been established to exhibit few or no signatures of line - of - sight absorption that could complicate modeling of the x - ray spectral features that are thought to carry signatures of black - hole spin ( gondoin et al .",
    "2001 ; emmanoulopoulos et al .",
    "otherwise known as `` bare seyfert galaxies '' , agn such as fairall  9 provide a `` clean '' direct view of the accreting black - hole system ( e.g. patrick et al .",
    "2011a ; tatum et al .",
    "2012 ; walton et al . 2013 ) .",
    "it is the x - ray spectrum from the innermost regions of the accretion disc that is thought to convey the signatures of relativistic effects in the vicinity of the black hole , including its spin .",
    "the basic method for constraining the black - hole spin involves fitting a model of the x - ray reflection spectrum from the accretion disc , and the associated fe  k@xmath0 emission line , with the broadening , or `` blurring '' effects of doppler and gravitational energy shifts being the key drivers ( e.g. , see reynolds 2014 ; middleton 2015 , and references therein ) .",
    "the disc - reflection model invariably used in the literature for agn in general is reflionx ( ross , fabian & young 1999 ; ross & fabian 2005 ) , combined with one of several alternatives for the `` blurring '' kernel ( e.g. laor 1991 ; doviak , karas & yaqoob 2004 ; brenneman & reynolds 2006 ; dauser et al . 2010 ) .",
    "other model components often need to be included to account for features that may or may not be directly related to the accreting black - hole system ( for example , additional or alternative soft x - ray emission , and/or narrow emission lines from distant matter at tens of thousands of gravitational radii from the black hole )",
    ". clearly , the fewer the number of model components that are needed , the less ambiguity and/or degeneracy there will be in constraining the black - hole spin .",
    "the reason why _ suzaku _ spectra for fairall  9 have received the attention of several studies is that the good energy resolution of the ccd detectors for measuring the crucial fe  k@xmath0 line profile , combined with the simultaneous sensitive coverage above 10  kev , provides a significant advance over previous capabilities for constraining the x - ray reflection spectrum and fluorescent line emission .",
    "early observations of fairall  9 with _ asca _ ( reynolds 1997 ) and _ xmm - newton _ ( gondoin et al .",
    "2001 ; emmanoulopoulos et al . 2011 ) lacked the high - energy coverage .",
    "nevertheless , a broad fe  k@xmath0 line ( the principal feature required for constraining black - hole spin ) was reported for the _ asca _ observation ( reynolds 1997 ) and for a 2009 _ xmm - newton _ observation ( emmanoulopoulos et al .",
    "2011 ) , but for an earlier _ xmm - newton _ observation in 2000 , gondoin et al .",
    "( 2001 ) reported no detection of a broad fe  k@xmath0 line .",
    "more recently , fairall  9 was targeted by a _ swift _",
    "monitoring campaign and three new _ xmm - newton _ observations , one of them simultaneous with _ nustar _",
    "( lohfink et al .",
    "although it was stated by the authors that they `` clearly detect blurred ionised reflection , '' detection of a relativistically broadened line alone ( as opposed to the joint detection of such a line and the reflection continuum as a single spectral component ) , was not claimed .",
    "the result of all the x - ray spectroscopy studies of fairall  9 that attempt to measure the black - hole spin is a wide range in its inferred value , ranging from zero to 0.998 , the theoretical maximum for accretion ( thorne 1974 ) .",
    "analyses of different data sets , as well as the same data set with different models , yield different black - hole spin measurements , some of which are inconsistent within the given errors . in some cases ,",
    "the inferred inclination angle of the accretion disc and the iron abundance are also inconsistent amongst different data sets and models applied .",
    "lohfink et al .",
    "( 2012a ) tried to resolve these serious conflicts by adding an additional soft x - ray continuum to their model and forcing the black - spin , disc inclination angle , and iron abundance to be invariant amongst different _ xmm - newton _ and _ suzaku _ data sets .",
    "however , this procedure involved adding nine free parameters in total to an already complex model , so it is not surprising that a consistent value of black - hole spin was able to fit the data .",
    "moreover , lohfink et al .",
    "( 2012a ) explained that the two different models of the additional soft x - ray continuum both left unresolved problems . in one case",
    "the additional soft x - ray continuum was a thermal comptonisation component that implied a colossal iron overabundance , with a lower limit of 8.2 relative to solar . in the other case ,",
    "the additional component was an ionised reflection spectrum ( using the reflionx model ) , but this solution implied a radial ionisation gradient in the accretion disc that predicts atomic features in the spectrum that are not observed .",
    "even if a viable consistent solution for the black - spin can be found for different data sets , the problem of the model - dependence of the black - hole spin based on fitting the same data with different models still remains .",
    "patrick et al . ( 2011b ) studied this model dependence for a small sample of agn observed by _",
    "suzaku _ ( including fairall  9 ) , and the severity of the model dependence led them to conclude that `` zero spin can not be ruled out at a particularly high confidence level in all objects . '' the principal difference in the applied models pertained to the exact model used for relativistic broadening of the fe  k@xmath0 line ( including the option of omitting that component altogether ) .",
    "several choices are available for such a model in popular x - ray spectral - fitting packages ( e.g. doviak et al .",
    "2004 ; dauser et al . 2010",
    "; patrick et al . 2011a ; middleton 2015 ) .",
    "it is also known that partial covering models can sometimes eliminate the need for a relativistically broadened fe  k@xmath0 emission line ( e.g. miller , turner & reeves 2008 ; iso et al .",
    "in such a scenario , there is degeneracy between the spectral curvature due to relativistic broadening of the fe  k@xmath0 line and the spectral curvature due to absorption by matter that partially covers the x - ray source .",
    "however , only one - dimensional partial covering models are typically applied , which may be incomplete because only line - of - sight absorption is considered , and compton scattering and fluorescent line emission from any globally distributed matter is not included . recently , a more sophisticated partial covering model has been applied to mkn  335 ( gallo et al .",
    "2015 ) , but the spectra were so complicated that both the blurred reflection model and the partial covering model left unmodeled residuals .",
    "it is therefore important to first understand the much simpler spectra of bare seyfert galaxies such as fairall  9 .",
    "another type of model that eliminates the need for a relativistically broadened fe  k@xmath0 line whilst also accounting for matter out of the line of sight invokes a compton - thick accretion disc wind ( tatum et al .",
    "2012 ) , and has also been successfully applied to fairall  9 .",
    "a different study involving a disc wind model , applied to the narrow line seyfert galaxy 1h  0707495 ( hagino et al .",
    "2016 ) , also led to the conclusion that the x - ray spectrum in this source can be modeled with absorption in the wind rather than invoking relativistic effects in strong gravity to produce a broad fe  k@xmath0 line .",
    "the implication of these studies is that if there is no relativistically broadened fe  k@xmath0 line emission from the innermost regions of the accretion disc , then there is no signature of black - hole spin in the x - ray spectrum . in this scenario ,",
    "measurements of black - hole spin obtained from applying models that do have relativistically broadened fe  k@xmath0 line emission are then artifacts of incorrect modeling .",
    "one feature that is common to all of the above - mentioned models fitted to the x - ray spectra of fairall  9 is the method of modeling the narrow core of the fe  k@xmath0 line , which is ubiquitous in both type  1 and type  2 agn ( e.g. yaqoob & padmanabhan 2004 ; nandra 2006 ; shu , yaqoob & wang 2010 , 2011 ; fukazawa et al .",
    "2011 ; ricci et al . 2014 ) .",
    "hereafter , it will be referred to as the distant - matter fe  k@xmath0 line , since it has a width that is typically less than a few thousand @xmath10 full width half maximum ( fwhm ) , corresponding to an origin in matter located at tens of thousands of gravitational radii from the black hole .",
    "shu et al .",
    "( 2011 ) measured a mean fwhm of @xmath11 from a sample of agn observed by the _ chandra _ high energy grating ( heg ) .",
    "they showed that in some agn the location of the distant - matter fe  k@xmath0 line emitter is consistent with the classical broad line region ( blr ) , yet in other agn the location is further from the black hole , possibly at the site of a putative obscuring torus structure that is a principal ingredient of agn unification schemes ( e.g. , antonucci 1993 ; urry & padovani 1995 ) .",
    "the peak energy of the narrow fe  k@xmath0 line is tightly distributed around 6.4  kev for both type  1 and type  2 agn ( e.g. sulentic et al . 1998 ;",
    "yaqoob & padmanabhan 2004 ; nandra 2006 ; shu et al .",
    "2010 , 2011 ) , providing a strong observational constraint on the neutrality of the matter producing the line , and any associated compton - scattered continuum .",
    "any attempt to measure the relativistically broadened fe  k@xmath0 line in agn x - ray spectra must properly account for the narrow distant - matter fe  k@xmath0 line because it can carry a luminosity that is comparable to , or even greater than that in the broad component .",
    "the models must also account for the compton - scattered ( reflection ) continuum in the matter that produces the narrow fe  k@xmath0 line . without exception , the previous studies of fairall  9 described above all use a model for the narrow fe  k@xmath0 line and the associated reflection continuum that is based on matter with an infinite column density , a flat ( disc ) geometry , and an infinite size , with the inclination angle of the disc relative to the observer fixed at an arbitrary value . in some cases",
    "the narrow fe  k@xmath0 line emission and the associated reflection continuum are calculated self - consistently using the model pexmon ( nandra et al .",
    "2007 ) or even a second ionised disc - reflection spectrum ( e.g. reflionx ) with the relativistic blurring turned off ( e.g. gallo et al . 2015 ) . in other cases the fe  k@xmath0 line emission is modeled with a simple gaussian , the reflection continuum is modeled with pexrav ( magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) , and the two components ( which are in reality not independent ) , are given ad hoc ( floating ) normalizations . in yet another variant , the narrow fe  k@xmath0 line emission is modeled with a gaussian component and the associated reflection continuum is completely ignored and omitted ( e.g. patrick et al .",
    "the assumption in the latter scenario is that the narrow fe  k@xmath0 line core originates in compton - thin matter and that the reflection continuum from that compton - thin matter is negligible and can be ignored .",
    "however , there is no basis for the omission of the reflection continuum from compton - thin matter and indeed , it was shown in the case of mkn  3 that it can not be neglected ( yaqoob et al .",
    "moreover , several recent studies have shown that the compton - scattered continuum from matter with a finite column density is different to that from matter with an infinite column density , and exhibits a rich variation in spectral shape ( murphy & yaqoob 2009 ; ikeda et al .",
    "2009 ; yaqoob 2012 ; liu & li 2014 ; yaqoob et al .",
    "2015 ; furui et al .",
    "the so - called `` compton - hump '' ( the peak in the reflection spectrum ) is no longer located at @xmath12  kev but depends on the column density ( as well as geometry and inclination angle ) , and can actually be located below the energy of the core of the fe  k@xmath0 line for column densities @xmath13 . the complexity of the reflection continuum from matter with a finite column density can potentially model features that are traditionally interpreted as relativistically broadened fe  k@xmath0 line emission .    in this paper",
    ", we make no assumptions about the column density of the matter producing the narrow fe  k@xmath0 line in fairall  9 and use the mytorus model of a toroidal x - ray reprocessor ( murphy & yaqoob 2009 ) to actually let the data determine the global column density of the reflecting material from spectral fitting . in the mytorus model , the fe  k@xmath0 line shape and flux are calculated self - consistently with respect to the associated reflection continuum .",
    "a compton - thick reflection spectrum similar to that from infinite column density disc - reflection models can be recovered as a limiting case in the mytorus model , which is based on a more realistic geometry for the circumnuclear matter than the disc geometry that has has been used in all of the previous studies of fairall  9 ( based on models such as pexrav and pexmon ) . in type  2 agn , column densities in the line of sight",
    "have been observed over a wide range , from compton - thin to compton - thick , with some sources exhibiting transitions between compton - thin and compton - thick states ( e.g. matt , guainazzi & maiolino 2003 ; risaliti et al .",
    "2010 , and references therein ) .",
    "it should therefore not be surprising if this range of column densities is also appropriate for the circumnuclear matter in type  1 agn .",
    "we note that from extended _ rxte _ monitoring data of fairall  9 , lohfink et al .",
    "( 2012b ) presented evidence of clumps of matter transiting across the x - ray source that did not completely extinguish the x - ray emission .",
    "the column density of the clumps was crudely estimated by lohfink et al .",
    "( 2012b ) to be  a few @xmath14 . however , markowitz , krumpe , & nikutta ( 2014 ) pointed out that the _ rxte _ monitoring data are also consistent with intrinsic spectral variability , an interpretation also given in later work by lohfink et al .",
    "( 2016 ) , based on a _ swift_/_xmm - newton_/_nustar _ campaign on fairall  9 in 2014 .    in this paper",
    "we apply the mytorus model to _ suzaku _ data for fairall  9 .",
    "the _ suzaku _",
    "data are well - suited for studying the x - ray reprocessor because _ suzaku _ provides simultaneous coverage of the critical fe  k band ( @xmath15  kev ) with good spectral resolution and throughput ( due to the xis ccd detectors ) , and of the hard x - ray band above 10  kev with good sensitivity .",
    "the simultaneous broadband coverage is important for reconciling the absorbed and reflected continua with the fe  k@xmath0 line emission .",
    "the scope and intent of the present work was to focus on _ suzaku_/_chandra _ heg data in the short term and provide a framework and basis for additional studies in the long term , e.g. with _ nustar_. we will show that our model , which includes no relativistically broadened fe  k@xmath0 line or disc reflection , gives an excellent fit to the _ suzaku _ data .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of fairall  9 , which can be explained by fe  k@xmath0 line emission and x - ray reflection from the distant matter alone , would then carry no information on black hole spin .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  [ obsdata ]",
    "we describe the basic data , and reduction procedures . in  [ analysisstrategy ]",
    "we describe the analysis strategy , including the procedures for setting up the x - ray reprocessing models for spectral fitting . in  [ spfitting ] we give the detailed results from spectral fitting . in  [ summary ] we summarize our results and conclusions .",
    "the present study pertains to an observation of fairall  9 made by the joint japan / us x - ray astronomy satellite , _ suzaku _ ( mitsuda et al .",
    "2007 ) on 2007 june 7 .",
    "_ suzaku _ carries four x - ray imaging spectrometers ( xis  koyama et al .  2007 ) and a collimated hard x - ray detector ( hxd  takahashi et al .",
    "each xis consists of four ccd detectors at the focal plane of its own thin - foil x - ray telescope ( xrt  serlemitsos et al .",
    "2007 ) , and has a field - of - view ( fov ) of @xmath16 .",
    "one of the xis detectors ( xis1 ) is back - side illuminated ( bi ) and the other three ( xis0 , xis2 , and xis3 ) are front - side illuminated ( fi ) .",
    "the bandpass of the fi detectors is @xmath17  kev and @xmath18  kev for the bi detector .",
    "the useful bandpass depends on the signal - to - noise ratio of the background - subtracted source data since the effective area is significantly diminished at the extreme ends of the operational bandpasses . although the bi ccd has higher effective area at low energies , the background level across the entire bandpass is higher compared to the fi ccds .",
    "the hxd consists of two non - imaging instruments ( the pin and gso  see takahashi et al .",
    "2007 ) with a combined bandpass of @xmath19  kev .",
    "both of the hxd instruments are background - limited , more so the gso , which has a smaller effective area than the pin . for agns ,",
    "the source count rate is typically much less than the background and in the present study we used only the pin data , as the gso data did not provide a reliable spectrum . in order to obtain a background - subtracted spectrum ,",
    "the background spectrum must be modeled as a function of energy and time .",
    "the background model for the hxd / pin has an advertised systematic uncertainty of 1.3 per cent .",
    "however , the signal is background - dominated , and the source count rate may be a small fraction of the background count rate , so the net systematic error in the background - subtracted spectra could be significant .",
    "the observation of fairall  9 was optimized for the xis in terms of positioning the source at the aim point for the xis ( the so - called `` xis - nominal pointing '' ) , at the expense of @xmath20 per cent lower hxd effective area .",
    "the principal data selection and screening criteria for the xis were the selection of only _ asca _ grades 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 , the removal of flickering pixels with the ftool cleansis , and exclusion of data taken during satellite passages through the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) , as well as for time intervals less than @xmath21  s after passages through the saa , using the t_saa_hxd house - keeping parameter .",
    "data were also rejected for earth elevation angles ( elv ) less than @xmath22 , earth day - time elevation angles ( dye_elv ) less than @xmath23 , and values of the magnetic cut - off rigidity ( cor ) less than 6 @xmath24 .",
    "residual uncertainties in the xis energy scale are of the order of 0.2 per cent or less ( or @xmath25  ev at 6.4  kev  see koyama et al .  2007 ) .",
    "the cleaning and data selection resulted in net exposure times that are reported in table  1 .",
    "the xis2 detector was not operational by the time of the fairall  9 observation so only data from xis0 , xis1 , and xis3 were available for analysis .",
    "we extracted xis spectra of fairall  9 by using a circular extraction region with a radius of 3.5. background xis spectra were made from off - source areas of the detector , after removing a circular region with a radius of 4.5 centered on the source , and the calibration sources ( using rectangular masks ) .",
    "the background subtraction method for the hxd / pin used the file ae702043010_hxd_pinbgd.evt , corresponding to the `` tuned '' version of the background model .    spectral response matrix ( `` rmf '' ) files , and telescope effective area ( `` arf '' ) files for the xis data were made using the _ suzaku _ ftools xisrmfgen and xissimarfgen respectively .",
    "the xis spectra from xis0 , xis1 , and xis3 were combined into a single spectrum for spectral fitting .",
    "the three `` rmf '' and three `` arf '' files were all combined , using the appropriate weighting ( according to the count rates and exposure times for each xis ) , into a single response file for the combined xis background - subtracted spectrum of fairall  9 .",
    "for the hxd / pin spectrum , the supplied spectral response matrix appropriate for the time of the observation ( ae_hxd_pinxinome3_20080129.rsp ) was used for spectral fitting .",
    "the useful energy bandpass for the spectrum from each instrument was determined by the systematics of the background subtraction . for the xis ,",
    "a useful bandpass of 0.509.1  kev was determined , for which the background was less than 20 per cent of the source counts in any spectral bin .",
    "the width of the bins for the xis data was 30  ev . with this spectral binning ,",
    "all bins in the 0.509.10  kev range had greater than 20 counts , enabling the use of the @xmath26 statistic for spectral fitting .",
    "( we avoid grouping spectral bins using a signal - to - noise ratio threshold because it can `` wash out '' absorption features . ) in addition to omitting data on the basis of background - subtraction systematics , we also omitted some spectral data that are subject to calibration uncertainties in the effective area due to certain atomic features .",
    "it is known that the effective area calibration is poor in the ranges @xmath27@xmath28  kev ( due to si in the detector ) and @xmath29@xmath30  kev ( au m edges due to the telescope ) .",
    "the effective area also has a significant , steep change at @xmath31  kev ( due to al in the telescope ) .",
    "we took the conservative approach of omitting xis data in the 1.71.9 and 2.12.35  kev energy ranges for the purpose of spectral fitting .",
    "for the hxd / pin , spectral bins with negative background - subtracted counts clearly indicate a breakdown of the background model in those bins .",
    "we found that the spectral data in the energy range 12.542.5  kev produced greater than 20 counts per bin ( after background subtraction ) , for bin widths of 3  kev .",
    "this gives the most reliable hxd / pin spectrum with minimal binning whilst at the same time qualifying the spectrum for spectral fitting using the @xmath26 statistic .",
    "the selected energy ranges for the xis and hxd / pin are summarized in table  1 , along with the corresponding count rates .",
    "the calibration of the relative cross - normalizations of the xis and pin data involves many factors ( e.g. see yaqoob ( 2012 ) for a detailed discussion ) . for observations that had the `` xis - nominal '' pointing , such as the present _ suzaku _ observation of fairall  9 , the pin : xis ratio ( hereafter @xmath32 ) , recommended by the _",
    "guest observer facility ( gof ) is @xmath33 .",
    "however , this value does not take into account background - subtraction systematics , sensitivity to the spectral shape , and other factors that could affect the actual ratio .",
    "on the other hand , allowing @xmath32 to be a free parameter could potentially skew the best - fitting parameters of a model at the expense of settling on a value of @xmath32 that is unrelated to the actual normalization ratio of the two instruments .",
    "consequently , we performed spectral fits for both cases ( @xmath32 free , and @xmath32 fixed at @xmath33 ) .",
    "in addition , a spectral fit was performed using only the xis data .",
    "we note that fairall  9 was observed by _ suzaku _ again on 2010 may 19 , for @xmath34  ks",
    ". however , this observation suffered from severe attitude problems , which have been described in detail in lohfink et al .",
    "( 2012a ) .",
    "the analysis of these data is complicated because the effective area and spectral response function calculations are compromised .",
    "although lohfink et al . ( 2012a ) proceeded to analyse the data by creating a new attitude solution ( as described in nowak et al .",
    "2011 ) , the software tool that generates the effective area for spectral response functions , xissimarfgen , was not designed to handle such large excursions in attitude ( see ishisaki et al .",
    "2007 for a detailed description of xissimarfgen ) .",
    "the resulting errors in the effective area are unquantified .",

    "in particular , both the baseline model fit , and the fit in which only the xis data are used , are statistically consistent with @xmath81 .",
    "both of these have face - on orientations of the torus , but other , non - grazing , orientations of the torus have little impact on this inferred column density .",

    "the high - energy continuum shape then controls the upper limit on @xmath73 ( a value that is too large would produce too much curvature ) .",

    "as far as fe  k@xmath0 line fluorescence and compton - reflection is concerned , this level of ionisation is negligible and does not conflict with the assumption that the x - ray reprocessor is essentially neutral .",
    "the other three _ suzaku _ spectral fits give energy shifts consistent with that from the baseline model .",

    "the fe  k@xmath0 line flux and ew from the other three _ suzaku _ fits , as well as from the _ chandra _ heg fit , are all consistent with the corresponding values from the baseline _ suzaku _ fit .",

    "unfortunately , due to the limited signal - to - noise ratio of the heg data , the fwhm has a lower limit that is similar to the _ suzaku _ lower limit , and an upper limit which is worse than the upper limit measured from the _ suzaku _ data .",
    "although the one - parameter , @xmath89 per cent confidence statistical errors imply that the fe  k@xmath0 line is resolved in all cases , we found that joint , two - parameter confidence contours of the line peak energy shift versus line fwhm showed that at 99 per cent confidence the line is not resolved by either the _ suzaku _ xis nor the _ chandra _ heg .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that the fe  k@xmath0 line could originate from the same location as the optical broad - line region ( blr ) since the fe  k@xmath0 line width measurements are consistent with the widths of some well - studied optical emission lines in fairall  9 .",

    "the model components in blue in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmprelfits](a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : cmprelfits](b ) show how the compton - scattered continuum from the mytorus model and the relativistically broadened fe  k@xmath0 line with blurred disc continuum respectively provide very different solutions to the same data . at a disc inclination angle of @xmath151 ,",
    "the relativistic line has significant emission in the blue wing but it also has a trailing red wing . in the mytorus model ,",
    "the downturn at low energies of the compton - scattered continuum , combined with the fe  k edge in that continuum conspire to mimic the relativistic line in the blurred reflection model .",
    "note that in the blurred reflection model the reflection continuum above the blue wing of the broad fe  k@xmath0 line drops by more than order of magnitude but recovers again at higher energies ( see plots in lohfink et al .",
    "2012a ) . obviously ,",
    "if the data had better spectral resolution , the two models may be distinguishable , but at ccd spectral resolution they are not distinguishable ( this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmprelline ] , discussed below ) .",
    "it is also important to note that it can be seen that the compton - shoulder in the mytorus model fit is not the reason why the mytorus model is able to mimic the relativistic line in fairall  9 , in part because the shoulder can not explain the blue wing , but also because with the velocity broadening of the narrow fe  k@xmath0 line of @xmath163  fwhm ( see table  2 ) , the compton shoulder can not be discerned as a distinct feature .",
    "this is expected , especially for data with ccd spectral resolution ( see yaqoob & murphy 2011 for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "the velocity broadening of the narrow , distant - matter fe  k@xmath0 line highlights another important difference between the mytorus and blurred reflection model fits .",
    "lohfink et al .",
    "( 2012a ) did not apply velocity broadening to the distant - matter fe  k@xmath0 line , which is part of the pexmon model in their blurred reflection fit .",
    "no justification was given for this omission , so it is an implicit assumption of their model that the line - emitting matter is sufficiently far from the central mass that doppler broadening is negligible compared to the ccd energy resolution .",
    "the result of this assumption is that the relativistic line in the blurred reflection model partly models the distant - matter narrow fe  k@xmath0 line , thereby exaggerating the relative importance of the relativistic line .",

    "[ fig : cmprelline](d ) . in the latter",
    ", it can be seen that turning off the relativistic fe  k@xmath0 line in the model leaves an excess in the data on blue side of the distant - matter fe  k@xmath0 line .",
    "this is not the case for mytorus model .",
    "the data to model ratios corresponding to fig .",

    "[ fig : cmprelline](e ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : cmprelline](f ) respectively ( note that the ratios are binned by a factor of 4 for clarity compared to the spectral plots ) .",
    "the data to model ratios further confirm that the broad , relativistic fe  k@xmath0 line is modeling part of the narrow , distant - matter fe  k@xmath0 line , and that aside from this difference , the feature in fig .  [ fig : cmprelline](e ) modeled by the mytorus model compton - scattered continuum is , as expected , very similar to the broad feature modeled as a relativistic line in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmprelline](f ) .",
    "whilst the limited signal - to - noise ratio of the data plays a role in allowing both models to fit the data , the smearing due to the limited energy resolution of ccd data is a key factor . if the energy resolution were better , the data to model ratios in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmprelline](e ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : cmprelline](f ) , which by definition have the models folded through the instrument response function , would reflect more clearly the differences in spectral shape between the two different models of the broad spectral feature .",
    "whereas the above analysis considered the mytorus and blurred reflection models separately , next we consider the upper limit on a blurred reflection model when it is added to the baseline mytorus model ( table  2 , column 2 ) . since it is clear from the residuals to the mytorus model ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig : fullbanddatzoom](d ) ) that adding a relativistic fe  k@xmath0 line would essentially result in fitting the noise in the data , the question of an upper limit on a blurred reflection component must be posed in a very specific context in order to give a meaningful result .",
    "allowing too many free parameters may result in none of them being constrained .",
    "thus , we added a reflionx model component , convolved with the relconv model , and again tested against the best - fitting values of the parameters given in table  4 of lohfink et al .",
    "( 2012a ) , fixing those parameters in the fits , except for the normalization of the reflionx component .",
    "we then obtained the 1-parameter , @xmath89 per cent confidence upper limit on this normalization .",
    "the upper limit that we obtained corresponds to a 210  kev flux for the blurred reflection component that is only 1.2 per cent of the total 210  kev flux .    in the reflionx model ,",
    "the fe  k@xmath0 line from the disc can not be separated from the disc - reflection continuum , so the equivalent width ( ew ) of the fe  k@xmath0 can not easily be calculated .",
    "therefore , we also considered the upper limit on the ew of a relativistically broadened fe  k@xmath0 line that is not attached to a reflection continuum , when it is added to the baseline mytorus model fit .",
    "inclusion of a reflection continuum would only reduce the upper limit on the ew .",
    "we tested the data against the laor model which gives a line profile due to emission from a disc associated with a maximally spinning black hole ( @xmath164 ; see laor 1991 ) .",
    "we fixed the inner disc radius at a value appropriate for the spin , namely @xmath165 gravitational radii , and we fixed the outer disc radius at 400 gravitational radii .",
    "we also fixed the radial emissivity index at @xmath166 .",
    "the disc inclination angle was fixed at the value of @xmath151 ( i.e. the value in table 4 of lohfink et al .",
    "we obtained a 1-parameter , 90 per cent upper limit on the ew of 27  ev .",
    "we repeated the procedure with the inclination angle fixed at @xmath52 and again obtained a small upper limit on the ew of the relativistic line of 32  ev . using line profiles corresponding to smaller values of black - hole spin would result in even smaller upper limits on the ew because the innermost stable orbit radius increases with decreasing black - hole spin , so the corresponding line profiles would have decreasing width .",
    "we have re - analysed _ suzaku _",
    "data for the `` bare '' seyfert  1 galaxy , fairall  9 , applying the mytorus model of murphy & yaqoob ( 2009 ) that self - consistently calculates the fe  k@xmath0 line emission and x - ray reflection spectrum from a toroidal distribution of neutral matter with solar iron abundance . we find that an excellent fit is obtained for the detailed fe  k@xmath0 line profile including the red and blue wings , the fe  k@xmath53 line , the fe  k edge , and the `` compton hump '' associated with the x - ray reflection spectrum .",
    "the same best - fitting parameters that determine the magnitude and shape of the x - ray reflection continuum also determine the fe  k@xmath0 line flux and profile with no additional freedom .",
    "the data require no ad hoc adjustment or interference of this self - consistency .",
    "we obtained an equatorial column density of the toroidal x - ray reprocessor of @xmath167 from a baseline fit , for the case that the torus is observed face - on and the cross - normalization between the pin and xis data is allowed to be free .",
    "other lines of sight that do not intercept the torus also provide excellent fits to the data , yielding similar constraints on the column density .",
    "a face - on fit with the pin data removed altogether also provides consistent constraints on @xmath73 . on the other hand , fixing the cross - normalization between the pin and xis spectra at the default value gives a column density that is @xmath78 per cent higher than that from the baseline fit .",
    "the baseline , face - on toroidal model gives a velocity broadening of the fe  k@xmath0 line of @xmath168  fwhm .",
    "variations on the baseline model also gave consistent values for the fwhm of the fe  k@xmath0 line .",
    "the fwhm measured here does not confuse broadening due to the compton shoulder of the fe  k@xmath0 line with velocity broadening since the broadening due to the compton shoulder is self - consistently modeled .",
    "the fe  k@xmath0 line width places the distance of the x - ray reprocessor at @xmath169 to @xmath170 gravitational radii from the putative central black hole .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath171 to @xmath172 for a black - hole mass in the range @xmath173 ( from historical reverberation measurements ) .",
    "the statistical errors quoted here for the fwhm are for one parameter , 90 per cent confidence , but we found that the fe  k@xmath0 line is not resolved at a confidence level of 99 per cent , for two parameters .",
    "thus , a location for the fe  k@xmath0 line emitter that is further out than @xmath174  pc can not be ruled out .",
    "we also detected narrow , unresolved fe  xxv(r ) and fe  xxvi  ly@xmath0 emission lines from highly ionised matter in a region distinct from the fe  k@xmath0 line emitter , further out from the central engine .",
    "the mytorus models , using only mundane , nonrelativistic physics , give such good fits to the fairall  9 data using only narrow fe  k@xmath0 line emission and x - ray reflection from distant matter that there is no need for any more complexity in the models .",
    "in contrast , previous analyses of the same _ suzaku _ data for fairall  9 have applied relativistic disc - reflection models that produce broad fe  k@xmath0 line emission and x - ray reflection from within a few gravitational radii of the black hole ( lohfink et al .",
    "2012a , and references therein ) .",
    "such fits have been used to directly derive constraints on the black - hole spin , or angular momentum . in our interpretation of the data , there are no signatures in the x - ray spectrum of the strong gravity regime , no broad fe  k@xmath0 line , and therefore no measure of black - hole spin based on the fe  k@xmath0 line and reflection spectrum . from a theoretical perspective",
    ", there is actually no precedent for emission features from within a few gravitational radii of the black hole to leave imprints on the x - ray spectrum since there are several ways to suppress such features .",
    "for example , the inner accretion disc may be truncated , or it may be too highly ionised ( e.g. see patrick et al .",
    "2013 for a recent discussion ) .",
    "we showed in detail how the spectral shape of the mytorus model in the fe  k band is able to replace the relativistically broadened fe  k@xmath0 line , but we also obtained an upper limit to the magnitude of a relativistically blurred accretion disc - reflection spectrum if it is included in addition to the mytorus model .",
    "relative to the baseline mytorus model , the 210  kev flux in the blurred reflection spectrum is @xmath175 per cent of the total observed 210  kev flux .",
    "an important factor in our mytorus spectral fits is the break from the common assumption that the x - ray reflector and fluorescent line emitter has an infinite column density .",
    "the x - ray reflection continuum from matter with a finite column density has a greater variety of spectral shapes than that from matter with an infinite column density .",
    "in particular , reflection spectra from matter with a finite column density can produce spectral structure around the fe  k@xmath0 line that might otherwise be interpreted as the effects of relativistic smearing .",
    "moreover , we note that in previous analyses of the x - ray spectra of fairall  9 that derived black - hole spin measurements , the infinite column density disc model was not only applied to what was thought to be the relativistic components , but it was also used to model the distant - matter ( narrow ) fe  k@xmath0 line and reflection spectrum . in future work",
    "we will apply the finite column density reprocessor models described here to other agn and other observations of fairall  9 in order to investigate whether our conclusions have a broader relevance .",
