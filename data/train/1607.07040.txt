    "eavesdropper might only want to decrypt a lossy version of source .",
    "schieler et al @xcite studied a distortion - based secrecy measure around the assumption that the eavesdropper has ability to conduct list decoding with fixed list size , and secrecy is measured by the minimum distortion over the entire list .",
    "@xcite used this secrecy measure to study the problem of source - channel secrecy in the shannon cipher system , and showed that for the source - channel pair satisfying certain conditions , the source coding , secrecy coding , and channel coding are operationally separable without any loss of optimality .",
    "jscc improves the robustness of communication or the performance of broadcast , while secrecy coding that exploits secret key or wiretap channel improves the security of communication .",
    "therefore , intuitively , the robustness and security could be obtained simultaneously if we combine jscc and secrecy coding together .",
    "several researchers have considered this joint source - channel secrecy ( jscs ) problem .",
    "yamamoto in @xcite studied secure lossy transmission over noisy wiretap channels , but the secrecy measure considered by him is cheap and fragile @xcite .",
    "a different formulation of the problem was considered in @xcite , where the authors assumed there is a fixed information leakage to the eavesdropper and wish to minimize the distortion at the legitimate receiver , while at the same time providing a graceful distortion degradation when there is an snr mismatch .",
    "they showed that , for a positive leakage , this can be achieved by a hybrid digital - analog coding .",
    "this scenario was extended to consider side information at the receiver in @xcite or side information at the sender in @xcite .    besides , analog encryption ( or analog scrambling ) technologies , e.g. , sign - change based scheme @xcite , permutation based scheme @xcite and bandwidth - keeping scheme @xcite , can be seen as jscs scheme as well , although they are not designed for any specified source - channel pair .",
    "sign - change based scheme improves secrecy by changing sign of each sample according to secret key . but",
    "owing to at most one bit secret key used per sample , this scheme could not provide higher secrecy even with a higher key rate .",

    "list secrecy @xcite is used to measure secrecy , in which the eavesdropper is allowed to conduct list decoding with fixed list size , and secrecy is measured by the minimum distortion over the entire list .",
    "we study the achievable tradeoff of secret key rate , list rate , eavesdropper distortion , and distortions of all legitimate users . for the achievability part",
    ", we propose an analog jscs scheme which cascades a linear coding with a random orthogonal transform .",
    "we also analyze the achievability result of the proposed jscs scheme , and give a comparison between the proposed jscs and an existing analog scheme .",
