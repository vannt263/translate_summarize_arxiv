    "recently it has been studied with great interest the possibility that particles undergo changes in their dispersion relation as a consequence of gravitational or high energy effects . hawking s spectrum for black holes , for instance , displays changes in the range of high frequencies @xcite .",
    "an analogous effect appears in the inflationary cosmology for the inflaton spectrum @xcite .",
    "another example is found in the field theory of non - commutative spaces , where the dispersion relation for photons also changes @xcite . in the semiclassical loop quantum gravity ( slqg )",
    "it is possible to find an expression for a field over the weak quantum gravitational background . for this",

    "a well known result from condensed matter is that small changes in the microscopic properties of a system can lead to important modifications in its macroscopic behavior . for quantum liquids , for example",
