    "the earth s magnetic field , which is believed to be generated by fluid motions in the outer core through the so - called geodynamo mechanism , has been in existence for at least 3 billion years according to paleomagnetic records .",
    "@xcite it is thought that the geodynamo is powered by compositional and thermal convection in the outer core.@xcite however , this conventional view of the geodynamo is called into question because of a tight energy budget .",
    "@xcite in particular , recently revised estimates of thermal conductivity that are higher than previously thought have placed the convection geodynamo in a more restricted position.@xcite alternatively , bullard @xcite first proposed that precession , a change of the orientation of the rotation axis , is a potential power source to generate the earth s magnetic field . from an energetic point of view , precession driven _ laminar _ flow can not extract sufficient energy to maintain the earth s magnetic field .",
    "@xcite in contrast , turbulent flows driven by precession can dissipate much more energy and thus are possible to sustain the geomagnetic field.@xcite in addition to the geodynamo , it has been proposed that the ancient lunar dynamo may be sustained by precession .",
    "@xcite however , these studies did not take into account the constraints of realistic magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) driven by the precessional forcing .",
    "gans @xcite first experimentally studied mhd in a precessing cylinder filled with liquid sodium , showing the signature of amplified magnetic fields but ultimately no self - sustained dynamo action . in the last decade",
    ", several numerical simulations have demonstrated that precession - driven flows can sustain magnetic fields through dynamo action in spherical , @xcite spheroidal @xcite and cylindrical @xcite geometries .",
    "in contrast with laboratory experiments and planetary cores , numerical simulations usually adopted a much higher ( @xmath0 ) magnetic prandtl number @xmath1 ( the ratio of the kinematic viscosity to the magnetic diffusivity ) than that is appropriate for liquid metals .",
    "therefore , the simulations are generally dominated by viscous dissipation rather than the ohmic dissipation . in addition , due to limited computational resources , numerical models use a relatively large ekman number ( @xmath2 ) which measures the typical ratio between the viscous force and the coriolis force .",
    "the present numerical study aims at shedding light on precession driven dynamos at relatively low ekman numbers and magnetic prandtl numbers .",
    "we work in a full sphere geometry . in this geometry only viscous coupling to the boundary is possible , and topographic couples that are effective in cylindrical and spheroidal geometries are entirely absent . based on our hydrodynamic simulations , @xcite we investigate precession driven dynamos in different flow regimes .",
    "it is of particular interest that the nonlinear evolution of precessional instabilities can lead to a few dominant cyclonic vortices ( i.e. rotating in the same direction as the background rotation ) , which are elongated along the rotation axis of the fluid .",
    "@xcite hereafter we refer to these vortices as large scale cyclonic vortices ( lscv ) .",
    "these large scale vortices are thought to be a favourable flow structure for magnetic field generation .",
    "@xcite indeed , our numerical simulations suggest that precession - driven lscv can sustain dynamos at relatively low magnetic prandtl numbers ( @xmath3 ) .",

    "based on previous hydrodynamic simulations , we have shown precession driven dynamos in different flow regimes . in the laminar regime , dynamo action operates mainly in a thin layer beneath the boundary since the bulk fluid is nearly a solid body rotation .",
    "our simulations at lower ekman numbers than previous studies clearly show that precession driven laminar dynamos are more difficult to obtain at low ekman numbers , as has been pointed out previously .",
    "@xcite the main result of the present study is that we have demonstrated magnetic field generation by large scale vortices in a precessing sphere , which has not been explored previously .",
    "small scale flows driven by precessional instabilities can merge into large scale cyclonic vortices due to the effect of rapid rotation .",
    "@xcite these vortices are elongated along the rotation axis of the fluid and the length scale of the vortices is independent of the ekman and poincar numbers in the parameter ranges that we have explored . due to the shearing between the vortices , magnetic fields",
    "are mainly generated in the region surrounding the cyclonic vortices with the fields also showing a columnar structure ( ) .",
    "it seems that the presence of the large scale vortices facilitates the onset of dynamo action , i.e. by lowering the critical magnetic prandtl number .",
    "this mechanism makes it possible to sustain dynamos at low ekman numbers , poincar numbers and magnetic prandtl numbers , which we believe moves towards the parameters regime of planets .",
    "in particular , we have demonstrated dynamo action in the regime of magnetic prandtl number @xmath3 , in which the diffusivities have the correct hierarchy with respect to the fact that @xmath119 for liquid metals and for the liquid cores of planets .",
    "in addition , it seems that the critical magnetic prandtl numbers for dynamos drops as one decreases the ekman number if the large scale cyclonic vortices are formed ( ) , although more generic scaling laws are required .",
    "nevertheless , these observations are promising with respect to further investigations and planetary applications .    in planetary settings , one would question whether precession driven flow is laminar or unstable in liquid cores .",
    "we have addressed this question for the earth and the moon in ref . here",
    "we briefly recall some conclusions . considering the luni - solar precession of the earth with a period of around 26,000 years , the criterion for all known instability mechanisms @xcite of the precession - driven flow is not matched .",
    "this suggests that the precession - driven flow in the earth s fluid core may be stable .",
    "hence we do not expect that the precession plays a significant role in the generation of the earth s magnetic field .",
    "however , there are still several uncertainties concerning this conclusion due to the possible effects of the solid inner core @xcite and interactions between precession and convection . @xcite for the case of the moon , we have estimated that the growth rate of precessional instability due to the conical shear layer is two orders of magnitude larger than the viscous decay rate , @xcite suggesting very complex flows in the lunar core driven by the 18.6 yr precession of the moon .",
    "therefore , a lunar dynamo driven by precession is possible during the evolution history of the moon , @xcite particularly if the large scale vortices are formed due to the precessional instability .",
    "however , the moon does not have an observable internal magnetic field generated by dynamo action at present time .",
    "note that not all of the power deposited by the precession is available to sustain a lunar dynamo .",
    "@xcite there is also a threshold power requirement to maintain the lunar core in a well - mixed adiabatic state , which is not matched at present day . @xcite",
    "although we have made great efforts to push towards the parameter regime of planets , our simulations are still far away from the realistic parameter regime , and there is little prospect of approaching the realistic parameters which require considerable computational resources .",
    "therefore , it would be helpful in future to extract some generic scaling laws from numerical models as in the studies of convection driven dynamos .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , laboratory experiments with liquid metals can reach more extreme parameters , which would significantly compensate for the limitations of numerical models .",
    "a liquid sodium experiment of a precessing cylinder with the height and diameter of 2 meters is under construction in dresden , germany , @xcite which is expected to provide new insights on precession driven dynamos .",
