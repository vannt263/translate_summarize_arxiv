    "<S> for the calculation of the lit we use expansions in hyperspherical harmonics ( hh ) in conjunction with the hh effective interaction ( eihh ) approach . </S>",
    "<S> the convergence of the lit expansion is discussed in detail . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated cross section agrees quite well with the available experimental data , which cover an energy range from threshold up to 100 mev .    </S>",
    "<S> the electromagnetic response of an @xmath1-body nucleus is a basic property in nuclear physics . </S>",
    "<S> it contains important information about the dynamical structure of the system . for this reason </S>",
    "<S> microscopic calculations are needed in order to investigate the details of the reaction mechanism and the underlying dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> traditionally such studies could only be made for few - body systems with @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the explicit calculation of final state wave functions constitutes the main limitation of standard approaches . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> these difficulties can be avoided in the lorentz integral transform ( lit ) method @xcite , where only a bound - state - like problem has to be solved although the full final state interaction ( fsi ) is rigorously taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> first applications of the method were made for electromagnetic responses of @xmath3he @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> enormous progress has also been achieved in the calculation of bound - state wave functions of systems with @xmath4 ( no core shell model @xcite and effective interaction hyperspherical harmonics ( eihh ) approach  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the novel methods of lit and eihh combined with the help of modern computational resources enabled us to carry out calculations of electromagnetic cross sections of nuclei with @xmath5 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , systems with @xmath6 are now considered an interesting playground for establishing a bridge between few- and many - body physics and especially for testing many - body approximations .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we present the first microscopic calculation of a photoabsorption reaction on a nucleus with a=7 , namely @xmath0li . in this calculation </S>",
    "<S> we use as nucleon - nucleon interaction the argonne potential av4 @xcite , which is a semirealistic central interaction that contains s- and p - wave forces . in recent work  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we found that the p - wave interaction has a significant influence on the photodisintegration cross section of p - shell nuclei , like @xmath7he and @xmath7li , and leads to a considerably better agreement with experimental data than a central s - wave interaction only . </S>",
    "<S> thus we have chosen this potential model for the present ab initio calculation of the @xmath0li total photoabsorption cross section . </S>",
    "<S> the calculational procedure is described in detail in @xcite . in the following </S>",
    "<S> we will briefly review the main steps only .    </S>",
    "<S> the inclusive unpolarized response function @xmath8 is defined by the total photoabsorption cross section @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the fine structure constant and @xmath11 the photon energy . in the lit method  @xcite one obtains @xmath12 from the inversion of the integral transform @xmath13 in the unretarded dipole approximation one has @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the dipole operator , @xmath16 the nuclear hamiltonian , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the angular momentum and spin of the ground state @xmath19 , with projections @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively ( since we work with central forces , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are good quantum numbers ) . </S>",
    "<S> the transform @xmath22 is evaluated by inserting a complete set of projection operators @xmath23 , where @xmath24 stands for the quantum numbers characterizing the channels ( angular momentum , spin , isospin and its projection , and parity , respectively ) , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are third components of angular momentum and spin . in the sum </S>",
    "<S> only the channels allowed by the dipole selection rules need to be considered and since the dipole operator does not depend on spin , we do not need to average over the initial spin projections ( @xmath21 ) , neither to sum over @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore one obtains @xmath27 where @xmath28 to simplify the notation , in the last two equations we have also omitted the dependences on @xmath25 and @xmath20 , as will be done in the following .    in order to use the lanczos algorithm ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) it is convenient to write @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is connected to the norm of @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 is evaluated as continuous fraction via the lanczos coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the lit of the total response is the sum of the lorentz transforms of the individual channels @xmath34 where for every channel one has @xmath35 .    in the case of @xmath0li </S>",
    "<S> one has total angular momentum and parity @xmath36 and isospin @xmath37 with projection @xmath38 . using central forces , </S>",
    "<S> one has ground state orbital angular momentum @xmath39 and spin @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> there are six different channels allowed by the dipole selection rules corresponding to angular momentum @xmath41 , spin @xmath42 and isospin @xmath43 with isospin projection conserved @xmath44 . in table </S>",
    "<S> i we show the good quantum numbers of these channels .    </S>",
    "<S> .good quantum numbers for the channels @xmath45 allowed by the dipole selections rules . </S>",
    "<S> [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in an analogous way we carried out the calculations for all the other channels . </S>",
    "<S> the estimated error introduced by these truncations is of the order of @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> we are also able to check the error introduced by the symmetry truncation in a second way . </S>",
    "<S> in fact a good check of the quality of the calculation is obtained by considering the sum over the norms @xmath47 defined in ( [ n_c ] ) . using completeness one finds @xmath48 where the last expression is nothing else than the mean expectation value of the operator @xmath49 in the ground state , that can be easily calculated ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . with respect to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 8 ] ) we obtained @xmath50 $ ] for the ground state expectation value with @xmath51 , while using a symmetry truncated expansion for @xmath45 up to @xmath52 we get @xmath53 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the small difference of @xmath54 reflects the small error introduced by the symmetry truncation .    </S>",
    "<S> as next point we address the quality of convergence of the lit with respect to the hh expansion . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , we first introduce the notation @xmath55 for the lit calculated with an expansion up to @xmath56 for the ground state and up to @xmath57 for @xmath45 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> that means @xmath58 represents the lit of channel c calculated with a maximal hyperangular momentum for those states which can be reached by a dipole transition from the ground state , whereas for @xmath59 the expansion of channel c is taken up to one step below this value . </S>",
    "<S> then we define @xmath60 where @xmath61 represents the relative percentage change for increasing @xmath56 by 2 together with a corresponding increase of @xmath62 while @xmath63 represents the relative change for increasing @xmath56 by 2 but keeping @xmath62 fixed .    in fig .  1  ( a ) we show the convergence pattern of @xmath61 for one of the more important of the six @xmath64 channels , namely @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> one readily sees that increasing @xmath56 results in a considerable reduction of @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , changing @xmath56 from 7 to 9 yields a @xmath67 between 5 and 15  % , where the lower value refers to the region of the maximum of the lit ( compare fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) , which however is still not negligible . </S>",
    "<S> it is very likely , that a further increase to @xmath68 would lead to a significant improvement of the convergence . </S>",
    "<S> although the calculation of the ground state for @xmath68 can be performed , the corresponding calculation of the final state with @xmath69 is beyond our present technical capabilities whereas it can be done for @xmath52 , i.e.@xmath70 can be calculated . </S>",
    "<S> thus the question now is , how much is the convergence improved in going from @xmath71 to @xmath72 . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we show @xmath63 in fig .  1  ( b ) for @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> again one notes a considerable decrease of @xmath63 with increasing @xmath56 and for the highest value @xmath68 of the order of 5  % in the region @xmath74  mev where the lit is more sizable . furthermore , comparing panels ( a ) and ( b ) of fig .  1 </S>",
    "<S> one can see that for a given @xmath56 the relative change @xmath66 is smaller than that of @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we expect that a further increase to @xmath76 would lead to a relative change with respect to @xmath77 smaller than @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> since the other channels behave similarly , we estimate a total uncertainty of about @xmath78 .    </S>",
    "<S> now we turn to the results for photodisintegration . in order to obtain the total photoabsorption cross section @xmath79 , we first invert the lits of the response functions for the various channels ( for details see @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> then one obtains the contribution to the cross section of each channel using the relation ( [ 0 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> summing up all contributions finally yields the total cross section @xmath79 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 we show both the calculated total cross section and the contributions of the separate channels . </S>",
    "<S> the energetically lowest open channel is the @xmath80 associated with the reaction @xmath0li </S>",
    "<S> @xmath81 @xmath3he @xmath82 with a threshold of @xmath83 mev ( the theoretical threshold obtained with the av4 potential is @xmath84 mev ) , whereas the lowest open @xmath85 channel corresponds to @xmath86li @xmath81 @xmath7he @xmath87 p , whose threshold is 9.975 mev ( the theoretical value is 12.41 mev ) . in fig .  2 </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical thresholds have been used .    for the @xmath88-channels in fig .  2  ( a ) one readily sees that by far the largest contribution comes from channel 3 rising steeply above threshold , reaching a maximum around 17  mev and falling off only slowly . </S>",
    "<S> channel 5 is the next in importance rising only slowly above 10  mev with a maximum near 33  mev and becoming then comparable in size to channel 3 . only in the </S>",
    "<S> very near threshold region channel 1 is dominant but then becomes much smaller than the other two channels . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2  ( b ) the @xmath89 channels have two dominant contributions , almost similar in size . </S>",
    "<S> channel 4 is slightly larger showing also a steep rise at threshold and slow fall - off with a maximum near 23  mev whereas the second in importance , channel 6 , shows a slow rise and a peak around 40  mev . </S>",
    "<S> compared to these two channels , the remaining channel 2 appears quite marginal . in view of the two maxima of almost equal height with a separation by about 17  </S>",
    "<S> mev the total @xmath89-contribution exhibits a broader distribution than the @xmath88-contribution with a shoulder on the low - energy side . </S>",
    "<S> the maxima of both contributions have about the same size but are separated by about 20  mev . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the resulting total cross section in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2  ( c ) shows also a broad distribution with a steep rise right above threshold , a slight shoulder above the maximum and a slow fall - off at higher energies .    </S>",
    "<S> this characteristic behavior is indeed exhibited by the experimental data on @xmath0li in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 where we show a comparison of the theoretical result to experimental data from  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that the theoretical cross section is shifted here from the theoretical threshold to the experimental one . </S>",
    "<S> one readily notes that the gross properties of the data , steep rise , broad maximum and slow fall off , are very well reproduced quantitatively over the whole energy region by the theory . </S>",
    "<S> it is worthwhile to emphasize that this result is based on an ab initio calculation in which the complicated final state interaction of the 7n - system is rigorously taken into account by application of the lit method . </S>",
    "<S> no adjustable parameters were used , the sole ingredient being the av4 nn potential model . </S>",
    "<S> it remains to be seen whether the slight variation of the data near and above the maximum will also be found in an experiment with improved accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a new measurement of the total cross section with a higher precision would be very desirable . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , this could clarify the question whether a simple semi - realistic potential like the av4 model is sufficient for an accurate theoretical description of this reaction or whether a more realistic nuclear force including a 3n - force is needed . </S>"
