    "however , recent research efforts have been directed towards not only synthesis of graphene - like materials , but also towards the functionalization of existing ultra - thin crystal structures .",
    "these recent studies have revealed some important results such as ( i ) tunable bandgap opening in graphene@xcite ( ii ) h - defect - induced magnetization of graphane,@xcite ( iii ) band gap engineering in silicene and germanene,@xcite ( iv ) stability enhancement in h - bn,@xcite ( v ) tunable magnetic features in tmds.@xcite    one of the most recently synthesized single layer semiconductor is lead iodide ( pbi@xmath0 ) . in bulk pbi@xmath0 , which is a member of metal halides family , van der waals stacked individual layers are in the form of octahedral t - phase . as a precursor material for lead",
    "iodide perovskites , given by the general formula of ch@xmath2nh@xmath2pbi@xmath3x@xmath4 ( x = cl , br ) , pbi@xmath0 has been used in many different device applications.@xcite recently , by performing the optical measurements and first - principles calculations of bulk and few - layer pbi@xmath0 , toulouse _",

    "we also focus on structural and electronic properties of half- and fully - hydrogenated monolayers of pbi@xmath0 .",
    "we found that the t - phase is energetically more favourable than h - phase and it is an indirect semiconductor .",
    "our investigation revealed that the chemical functionalization by both half- and full - hydrogenation cause reconstruction in the structure of monolayer pbi@xmath0 and lead to significant reduction in the band gap of the structure .",
    "such a hydrogen - driven reconstruction in monolayers of pbi@xmath0 have not been reported before .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ comp ] we give details of our computational methodology .",
    "an overview of the structural phases and the electronic properties of monolayer hexagonal pbi@xmath0 are presented in sec .",

    "the effects of the one side hydrogen coverage , in other word half - hydrogenation , of monolayer pbi@xmath0 are given in sec.[half ] , and after that properties of fully - hydrogenated monolayer pbi@xmath0 are presented in sec .",

    "we perform the structural optimization and molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations by using the vienna ab - initio simulation package , vasp@xcite which is based on density functional theory ( dft ) . to describe electron exchange and correlation the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) form of the generalized gradient approximation",
    "( gga)@xcite was adopted .",
    "the vdw forces , which are effective on intralayer interaction , were taken into account by using the dft - d2 method of grimme.@xcite to obtain the charge distribution of the configuration , a bader charge analysis was used.@xcite the stability of the resulting structures was examined with ab - initio md calculations .",
    "the following parameters were used for analyses . the total energy difference between the sequential steps in the iterations",
    "was taken 10@xmath5 units as convergence criterion .",
    "the convergence for the hellmann - feynman forces on each unitcell was taken to be 10@xmath6 ev /  . 0.05 ev of gaussian smearing factor was used and the pressures on the unit cell were decreased to a value less then 1.0 kb in all three directions . for the determination of accurate charge densities , brillouin zone integration was performed using a @xmath7 @xmath8-centered mesh for the primitive unit cell . to avoid interactions between adjacent pbi@xmath0 configurations ,",

    "the fermi level ( e@xmath10 ) is given by green solid line.,width=8 ]    .[table1 ] calculated parameters for monolayer pbi@xmath0 are the lattice constant in the lateral direction , @xmath11 ; the atomic distance pb and i atoms , d@xmath12 ; the charge transfer from pb to i atom , @xmath13 ; the work function @xmath14 ; and the cohesive energy , e@xmath15 . e@xmath16 and e@xmath17 are the energy band gap values within gga and gga+soc , respectively . [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for further analysis of the half - hydrogenated structure we also perform finite temperature md calculations . our calculations showed that starting from very low temperatures ( 20 - 25 k ) half - h - pbi@xmath0 tends to undergo a structural transformation .",
    "apparently , the perfectly hexagonal half - hydrogenated structure mentioned before corresponds to a local minimum on born - oppenheimer surface and for the determination of the ground state structure one needs small perturbation such as temperature .",
    "then , by performing full structural optimization of the distorted structure created by md calculation , we obtained the real ground state crystal structure of half - h - pbi@xmath0 .",
    "as shown in figs .",
    "[ fighalf ] ( c ) and ( d ) , the ground state of half - h - pbi@xmath0 forms a ( 2@xmath11 ) reconstructed surface .",
    "it is calculated that this ( 2@xmath11 ) reconstructed phase of half - h - pbi@xmath0 is 0.41 ev per unitcell more favourable than the perfectly hexagonal phase which is obtained by a total energy calculation performed at 0 k. in this half - h - pbi@xmath0 structure , there are two bonding types of h atom .",
    "one h atom stands over the i atom with an angle of 28.5@xmath18 with the normal of the structure plane , the other h reclines parallel to the surface at level of the i atoms . as given in table [ table2 ] , the lattice constants are 4.22 and 7.83  with an angle of 58.9@xmath18 and the workfunction at the hydrogenated side is found to be 3.57 ev . on the other side , the h binding energy per h atom is 0.64 ev which is much larger than that of single h on 3x3 supercell ( e@xmath19=0.32 ev for single h ) .",
    "the charge distributions of the reconstructed structure are specific for the structurally different pb , i , and h atoms . in general , with respect to h atom bonding configurations , all atoms have specific charge in ( 2@xmath11 ) reconstracted unitcell ( see fig .",
    "[ fighalf ] ( c ) , ( d ) , and ( e ) ) . shortly , the standing- and reclining - h atoms have 1.1 and 1.0 @xmath20 ; the i atoms bonded with standing- and reclining - h have 7.0 and 7.1 @xmath20 ; the pb atoms close to standing- and reclining - h have 3.4 and 3.7 @xmath20 , respectively . on the bare side of the half - h - pbi@xmath0 ,",
    "the i atoms have larger charge of 7.3 and 7.4 @xmath20 which are aligned in _",
    "z_-axis with standing- and reclining - h , respectively    furthermore , upon the temperature - driven structural transformation from perfectly hexagonal to ( 2@xmath11 ) reconstructed phase , not only the structure but also electronic properties are modified dramatically . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fighalf ] ( g ) , the reconstruction removes the metallic property and the system becomes semiconductor with a small band gap of 0.35 ev .",
    "the band gap is still indirect in which the vbm and cbm are at m and @xmath8 points , respectively . after the reconstruction",
    "the system has a nonmagnetic ground state .",
    "this type of distortions are known as jahn - teller distortion in which the dangling bonds are filled up and the system transforms from metal to semiconductor .",
    "therefore , semiconducting nature of ( 2@xmath11 ) reconstructed phase of half - h - pbi@xmath0 , that corresponds to the ground state structure , is quite important for nanoscale optoelectronic device applications .",
    "as well as one - side hydrogenation that may be realized on one - side - supported material , one can also achieve both - side coverage of monolayer pbi@xmath0 ( full - h - pbi@xmath0 ) when it is in freestanding form .",
    "structural analysis of the full - h - pbi@xmath0 is performed by applying the same methodology .",
    "md calculations revealed that the ground state atomic structure of the full - h - pbi@xmath0 is quite different from half - h - pbi@xmath0 .",
    "similar to half - hydrogenated structure , h - induced reconstructions take place starting from 20 - 25 k and therefore three different types of i - h bonds ( perpendicular , tilted bond with 44.8@xmath18 , and the reclined parallel to the surface ) are formed over the pbi@xmath0 surface ( see figs .",
    "[ figfull ] ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) ) .",
    "then the analysis of fully - optimized crystal structure reveals that the primitive unitcell of full - h - pbi@xmath0 contains a ( 2@xmath12 ) reconstructed phase of pbi@xmath0h@xmath0 . as given in the table [ table2 ] ,",
    "lattice parameters of the ( 2@xmath12 ) reconstructed structure are calculated to be 8.29 and 8.02  with an angle of 63.0@xmath18 .    upon full hydrogenation , not only the structure but also work functions , cohesive energies and the h",
    "binding energies significantly differ from half - hydrogenated structure .",
    "the work function of the full - h - pbi@xmath0 is found to be 3.73 ev . the cohesive energy of the full - h - pbi@xmath0 is calculated to be 2.03 ev smaller than that of half - h - pbi@xmath0 . the calculated average binding energy of an h atom is 0.93 ev which is larger as compared to those of single h and half - hydrogenated cases . here , it is noteworthy that the larger binding energy is consistent with the slightly larger work function . as shown in figs .",
    "[ figfull ] ( d ) the full - h - pbi@xmath0 is a semiconductor with an indirect band gap of 0.76 ev .",
    "the vbm and cbm stay at m and @xmath8 points which are similar to those of half - h - pbi@xmath0 .",
    "it is also seen that the jahn - teller type distortion in the structure removes dangling bonds and therefore the system is converged to non - magnetic semiconducting ground state .",
    "ed     ( color online ) ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) illustrate the structure of full - hydrogenated monolayer pbi@xmath0 from top , side views with the corresponding directions , respectively .",
    "( d ) is the band structure of full - hydrogenated monolayer pbi@xmath0 .",
    "the fermi level ( e@xmath10 ) is given by green solid line.,width=8 ]",
    "in this paper , we studied the newly emerging ultra - thin pbi@xmath0 which is a member of metal halides .",
    "starting from the comparison of two possible monolayer phases , 1 t and 1h , interaction with single h atom , half- and full - hydrogenation of monolayer pbi@xmath0 were investigated using first principles dft calculations .",
    "the 1 t phase was found to be favourable with the band gap of 2.69 and 1.93 ev within gga and gga+soc , respectively .",
    "our calculations also showed that the h atoms strongly reacts with the pbi@xmath0 surface and further functionalization of its surfaces can be realized .",
    "the binding energy was found to be 0.3 ev .    in the case of half - hydrogenation , it was found that the ( 2@xmath11 ) jahn - teller type distorted ground state structure corresponds to the ground state phase .",
    "we showed that reconstruction from perfectly hexagonal structure to 2@xmath11 half - h - pbi@xmath0 leads to dramatical modifications such as ( i ) metal - to - semiconductor transition ( ii ) removal of magnetic moments .",
    "moreover , our calculations revealed that full - hydrogenated monolayer pbi@xmath0 forms another ( 2@xmath12 ) jahn - teller distorted form in its ground state . in that case , the structure , full - h - pbi@xmath0 , was a nonmagnetic semiconductor with a bandgap of 0.76 ev .",
    "our results reveal that hydrogenation is an efficient way to engineer the structural and electronic properties of single layer pbi@xmath0 .",
