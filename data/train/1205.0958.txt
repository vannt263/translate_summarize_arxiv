    "the theory of infinitely repeated games has been very influential in the social sciences showing how repeated interaction can provide agents with incentives to overcome opportunistic behavior .",
    "however , a usual criticism of this theory is that there may be a multiplicity of equilibria .",
    "while cooperation can be supported in equilibrium when agents are sufficiently patient , there are also equilibria with no cooperation .",
    "moreover , a variety of different punishments can be used to support cooperation .    to solve this multiplicity problem ,",
    "we study what types of strategies will have a large basin of attraction regardless of what other strategies are considered in the evolutionary dynamic .",
    "more precisely , we study the replicator dynamic over arbitrary finite set of infinitely repeated strategies in which the strategy makes a mistake with a small probability @xmath0 in every round of the game .",
    "we study which strategies have a non - vanishing basin of attraction with a uniform size regardless of the set of strategies being considered in the population .",
    "we say that a strategy has a uniformly large basin of attraction if it repels invasions of a given size for arbitrarily patient players and small probability of errors and for any possible combination of alternative strategies ( see definition [ ulbs ] for details ) .",
    "we find that two well known strategies , `` always defect '' and `` grim , '' do not have uniformly large basins of attraction .",
    "moreover , any strategy that does not forgive can not have a uniformly large basin either .",
    "the reason is that , as players become arbitrarily patient and the probability of errors becomes small , unforgiving strategies lose in payoffs relative to strategies that forgive and the size of the basins of attraction between these two strategies will favor the forgiving one .",
    "this is the case even when the inefficiencies happen off the equilibrium path ( as it is the case for grim ) .    also , we show that symmetric strategies leading to inefficient payoffs ( on or off the path ) can not have uniformly large basins of attractions .",
    "we also provide some efficiency results for asymmetric strategies .",
    "first , we show that there is a relationship between the size of the basin of attraction and the frequency of cooperation .",
    "second , we show that there is a relationship between the degree of asymmetry of a strategy and its efficiency .",
    "third , we show that strategies with a uniformly large basin of attraction can not have inefficient payoffs in all histories",
    ".    it could be the case that inefficient and unforgiving strategies do not have uniformly large basins since actually there may be no strategies with that property !",
    "we prove that that is not the case by showing that the strategy `` win - stay - lose - shift '' has a uniformly large basin of attraction , provided a sufficiently small probability of mistakes . as this strategy is efficient ( and symmetric ) , we show that the concept of uniformly large basins of attraction provides a ( partial ) solution to the long studied problem of equilibrium selection in infinitely repeated games : only efficient equilibria survive for patient players if we focus on symmetric strategies .    note that we not only provide equilibrium selection at the level of payoffs but also at the level of the type of strategies used to support those payoffs : the payoffs from mutual cooperation can only be supported by strategies that do not involve asymptotically inefficient punishments .",
    "this provides theoretical support to the claims of axelrod @xcite , that successful strategies should be cooperative and forgiving .",
    "in addition , we prove that our results are robust to perturbation of the replicator dynamic provided that it is still the case that the only growing strategies are those that perform better than the average .    in our study of the replicator dynamics ( and its perturbations )",
    "we develop tools that can be used to analyze the basins of attractions outside of the particular case of infinitely repeated games .",
    "in fact the results are based in a series of theorems about general replicator dynamics which can be used to study the robustness of steady states for games in general .",
    "an extensive previous literature has addressed the multiplicity problem in infinitely repeated games .",
    "part of this literature focuses on strategies of finite complexity with costs of complexity to select a subset of equilibria ( see rubinstein @xcite , abreu and rubinstein @xcite , binmore and samuelson @xcite , cooper @xcite and volij @xcite ) .",
    "this literature finds that the selection varies with the equilibrium concept being used and the type of cost of complexity .",
    "another literature appealed to ideas of evolutionary stability as a way to select equilibria and found that no strategy is evolutionary stable in the infinitely repeated prisoners dilemma ( boyd and lorberbaum @xcite ) .",
    "the reason is that for any strategy there exists another strategy that differs only after events that are not reached by this pair of strategies .",
    "as such , the payoff from both strategies is equal when playing with each other and the original strategy can not be an attractor of an evolutionary dynamic .",
    "bendor and swistak @xcite circumvent the problem of ties by weakening the stability concept and show that cooperative and retaliatory strategies are the most robust to invasions .",
    "in a different approach to ties , boyd @xcite introduced the idea of errors in decision making .",
    "if there is a small probability of errors in every round , then all events in a game occur with positive probability destroying the certainty of ties allowing for some strategies to be evolutionary stable . however , as shown by boyd @xcite and kim @xcite , many strategies that are sub - game perfect for a given level of patience and errors can also be evolutionary stable .",
    "fudenberg and maskin @xcite ( see also fudenberg and maskin @xcite ) show that evolutionary stability can have equilibrium selection implications if we ask that the size of invasions that the strategy can repel to be uniformly large with respect to any alternative strategy and for large discount factors and small probabilities of mistakes .",
    "they show that the only strategies with this characteristic must be cooperative .",
    "there are three main differences with our results .",
    "first , fudenberg and maskin @xcite focus on strategies of finite complexity while we do not have that restriction .",
    "second , our robustness concept does not only consider the robustness to invasion by a single alternative strategy but also robustness to invasion by any arbitrary combination of alternative strategies .",
    "in other words , we also look at the size of the basin of attraction inside the simplex .",
    "third , our full efficiency result only applies to the case of symmetric strategies and we only provide partial efficiency results for the general case .",
    "we want to point out that to prove efficiency we use a similar approach to the one used in @xcite .",
    "our results also relate to johnson , levine and pesendorfer @xcite , volij @xcite and levine and pesendorfer @xcite who use stochastic stability ( kandori , mailath and rob @xcite and young @xcite ) to select equilibria in infinitely repeated games . as having large basin of attraction",
    "is a necessary condition ( but not sufficient ) for stochastic stability , the present results could help characterize strategies that are stochastically stable in any finite population .",
    "there is a previous theoretical literature providing evolutionary support for the strategy win - stay - lose - shift ( see nowak and sigmund @xcite and imhof , fudenberg and nowak @xcite ) .",
    "this strategy has received little support from experiments on infinitely repeated games ( see dal b and frchette @xcite , fudenberg , rand and dreber @xcite and dal b and frchette @xcite ) .",
    "we hope that new experiments can be designed to test this strategy s robustness to invasions when it is already highly prevalent in the population .    finally , our result linking the size of the basin of attraction and the frequency of cooperation relates to other experimental evidence provided by dal b and frchette @xcite .",
    "they find that the frequency of cooperation is increasing in the size of the basin of attraction of grim versus the strategy always defect .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ trembles ] we introduce the infinite repeated prisoners dilemma with trembles . in section [ att ]",
    "we define the replicator dynamics in any dimension . in theorem",
    "[ a1 ] we give sufficient conditions for a vertex to have a large local basin of attraction independent of the dimension of the payoff matrix .",
    "more precisely , the conditions give a lower bound for the size of the basin of attraction .",
    "those conditions are based on comparing simultaneously the dynamics associated to group of three vertices .",
    "moreover , in subsection [ comparing 2 to 2 ] we show that for a two dimensional simplex , the conditions of theorem [ a1 ] with extra assumptions , also provide an upper bound for the size of the basin of attraction .",
    "in particular , we show that to have a large basin of attraction is not enough to analyze the dynamic of one dimensional simplex .",
    "in section [ replicator ipd ] we recast the replicator dynamics in the context of infinite repeated prisoners dilemma with trembles .",
    "we define the notion of strategy having a uniformly large basin of attraction ( see definition [ ulbs ] ) . in section",
    "[ g nb tr subs a ] we show that unforgiving strategies do not have a uniformly large basin ( this includes the strategies always defect and grim ) . in section [ efficiency sec ] we prove that for any history , the frequency of cooperation converges to one for symmetric strategies that have a uniformly large basin of attraction . in subsection [ wef - sec ]",
    "we obtain an efficiency result for asymmetric strategies .",
    "first , we show that there is a relationship between the frequency of cooperation of a strategy and the size of its basin of attraction .",
    "second , we show the frequency of cooperation after any history is bounded below by a quantity that is related to how asymmetric the strategy involved is ( the less asymmetric a strategy is , the higher the frequency of cooperation ) .",
    "third , we show that if there is a finite path such that the strategy does no fully cooperate with itself for any sequel history , then the strategy does not have a uniformly large basin of attraction ( see theorem [ teowef-2 ] and observe that this result requires considering populations of at least three strategies ) . in section [ large basin ]",
    "we show how to adapt theorem [ a1 ] to the context of the set of all the strategies .",
    "in particular , in subsection [ asy bound tr subs ] we provide sufficient conditions to guarantee that a strategy has a uniform large basin of attraction . as they follow from theorem [ a1",
    "] , these conditions basically consist of analyzing all the possible set of three strategies .",
    "moreover , in subsection [ cara a cara no alcanza ] we show that weaker conditions that consist of comparing sets of two strategies are not enough to have a uniformly large basin of attraction . in section",
    "[ calculating ] we develop a technique to calculate the payoff with trembles for certain type of strategies ( see definition [ sgpuniformstrict ] ) provided certain restriction on the probability of mistakes ( see lemma [ bounding n bar n b 2 ] ) . in section",

    "[ perturbed ] we show that theorem [ a1 ] also holds for a general type of equation that resembles the replicator dynamics .",
