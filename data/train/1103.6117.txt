    "models of galaxy formation and evolution generally use semi - empirical `` recipes '' to follow the process of star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "typically , star formation is assumed to set in only above a `` threshold '' gas ( column ) density @xmath11  and beyond that to be proportional to a power of @xmath11 .",
    "this is supported by observations of nearby star forming galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , most of these observations are of large spiral galaxies , whereas from the hierarchical galaxy formation model one would expect that the first formed systems were much smaller than the typical @xmath12 spiral . here",
    "we study the relation between gas and star formation in nearby , extremely faint ( m@xmath2 , @xmath3 km  s@xmath4 ) gas rich dwarfs .",
    "the dwarf galaxies in our sample are dynamically and structurally very different from the large spiral galaxies for which the widely used star formation recipes have been derived .",
    "firstly , in our sample galaxies the rotation velocity is not much larger than the velocity dispersion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "further , the gas does not settle into a thin disc ; the mean observed axial ratio of the _ gas _ discs is @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "both this as well as the expectation that negative feedback from supernovae would play a more important role in small galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) make it likely that the relationship between the gas density and star formation in dwarf galaxies is different from that in spirals .",
    "observationally , there is another major difference between studies of star formation recipes in dwarf galaxies and spirals .",
    "molecular gas is almost never detected in dwarf galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which means that the gas column density has to be estimated from the hi column density @xmath0  alone",
    ". on the other hand , in large spirals , the star formation appears to be governed by the molecular gas density and to be much less ( if at all ) related to the atomic gas(e.g . * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , in @xcite  ( henceforth r09 ) we showed that for dwarf galaxies , in regions of active star formation , the star formation rate @xmath1  _ is _ correlated to the hi column density , albeit with significant scatter .",
    "r09 also found that there was no sharp `` threshold '' for star formation , with star formation proceeding at all gas column densities , down to the sensitivity limit of the data .",
    "similarly , @xcite find that in the hi dominated outskirts of spiral galaxies , the sfr and hi are correlated , albeit with a scatter .    in this paper",
    "we extend our previous work in two important directions .",
    "firstly we try to quantify the stochastic nature of the relationship between @xmath1  and @xmath0 .",
    "secondly we also study the relationship between the gas column density and the formation of stars of different masses .",
    "our sample consists of 23 galaxies drawn from the gmrt figgs hi 21 cm survey @xcite with uv data from _",
    "galex_. see r09 for details . for 11 of these 23 galaxies",
    "@xmath10   data from the 6 m bta telescope in russia is available .",
    "the full sample has median hi mass m@xmath14 , median blue magnitude m@xmath15 , and median velocity width @xmath16 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "the corresponding values for the @xmath10  subsample is m@xmath17 , m@xmath18 , @xmath19 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "the galaxies with @xmath10  observations are listed in table  [ tab : samp ] ; the columns in the table are : column(1 )  the galaxy name , column ( 2 )  the absolute blue magnitude ( corrected for galactic extinction , the internal extinction correction has been assumed to be negligible ) , column(3 )  the distance in mpc , column(4 )  the group membership of the galaxy .",
    "all of this data has been taken from @xcite .",

    "the sample [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath21 : diameters correspond to the holmberg system (  26.5 mag arcsec@xmath7 )    background corrected _ galex _ fuv band ( 1350 - 1750 @xmath22 ) images were converted into luminosity units using the calibration information provided at the _ galex _ site .",
    "correction for galactic extinction was done using extinction values of @xcite and using formulae from @xcite to extrapolate to the fuv band .",
    "no correction for internal extinction was made , since our sample galaxies are expected to be extremely dust poor .",
    "the luminosity values thus obtained were converted to star formation rates using the calibration given in @xcite : @xmath23 in deriving this calibration it is assumed that the stellar distribution has solar metallicity and a salpeter imf , and that the galaxy has had continuous star formation over time scales of 10@xmath24 years or longer .",
    "the implications of these assumptions are discussed in section  [ sec : res ] .",
    "details of the @xmath10   data reduction can be obtained from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the images were corrected for dust extinction due to our own galaxy in a similar way as was done for the fuv maps .",
    "the @xmath10   luminosity was converted to star formation rates using the calibration given in @xcite : @xmath25 the assumptions used to derive this calibration are the same as that used in deriving the fuv flux -sfr calibration    for data from all the three wavelengths , relevant parameters ( @xmath0   and @xmath1 ) were calculated over several scales , viz .",
    "a ) an average over the entire star forming disc of the respective galaxy ( i.e. `` global '' values ) .",
    "the `` star forming disc '' is defined as that within the radius at which the star formation rate is 1.85@xmath2610@xmath27 m@xmath28 yr@xmath4 kpc@xmath7(as measured from the fuv flux , with the _ galex _ images smoothed to 400  pc linear resolutions ) .",
    "this approximately corresponds to the b  band holmberg diameter for those sample galaxies for which the holmberg diameter has been measured .",
    "b ) `` pixel '' values .",
    "we use `` pixels '' that nyquist sample squares 400  pc or 150  pc in size . for the hi images 400  pc resolution images are available for all the galaxies in our sample .",
    "similarly for the fuv data , 150  pc resolution images are available for all galaxies .",
    "figure  [ fig : ovl ] shows @xmath10   greyscale images overlayed with fuv and hi contours , for a representative galaxy in our sample .",
    "figure  [ fig : global][a ] shows the relationship between the disc - averaged @xmath29  ( and corresponding @xmath30 ) and @xmath0  for the galaxies in our sample with @xmath10   data .",
    "note that the galaxies are forming stars even though their typical gas density is at or below the `` threshold density '' .",
    "panel  [ b ] shows how the global @xmath1   estimates obtained using the two different tracers relate .",
    "although the sfr tracers do correlate , there is a considerable scatter about the 1:1 line .",
    "note that the data agrees better with the original calibration suggested by @xcite than with the re - calibration suggested by @xcite , though it should be noted that the latter sample is much larger than ours . in terms of total sfr",
    "the values range from @xmath31 to @xmath32 with fuv as tracer , and from @xmath33 to @xmath34 with @xmath10  as tracer .",
    "finally , following @xcite we show in panel  [ c ] the ratio @xmath30/@xmath29   as a function of @xmath29 .",
    "there is a clear correlation and the best fit line has a slope of @xmath35 , ( compared to -0.59 obtained by @xcite ) .",
    "the sfr calibration we used assumes solar metallicity , however , as discussed in detail by @xcite , the fact that the dwarf galaxies have lower than solar metallicity has only a marginal effect on the @xmath30/@xmath29   ratio , since both calibrations are similarly affected .    in what follows",
    "we take a look at the relationship between gas and star formation on small scales , by making `` pixel - by pixel '' comparisons of @xmath0  and @xmath1 .",
    "we first focus on stochasticity in the star formation and return to the comparison between @xmath29  and @xmath30 in sec .",
    "[ ssec : massive ] .",
    "r09 showed that from a comparison of the fuv and hi images , in star forming regions @xmath30  and @xmath0   are related as    @xmath36    by comparison with the canonical k - s law    @xmath37    .    and noting that ( i)@xmath0  is a strict lower limit to the total @xmath11 and ( ii ) for a given fuv flux the inferred sfr decreases with decreasing metalicity , the robust conclusion that one can draw is that the star formation process in dwarf galaxies is significantly less efficient than that in big galaxies .",
    "r09 also showed ( see their fig .",
    "6 ) that the data implied stochasticity and were best modelled as a stochastic power law with a variation of 50% in the coefficient ( as opposed to the slope ) of the power law . @xcite",
    "had also highlighted the stochasticity in the relation between @xmath1  and @xmath0  in dwarf galaxies . to properly characterize the star formation process , one would hence also need to know the average fraction of the gas that is participating in the star formation process .",
    "figure  [ fig : sfr_frac ] shows the fraction of pixels which are observed to be star forming ( i.e. have a star formation rate of at least @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the rms in the uv image , in units of the star formation rate ) . the plot averages over 16 of the original sample of 23 galaxies , 7 galaxies with relatively low galex exposure times have been excluded .",
    "the dashed vertical lines indicate the rms level ( after being translated from @xmath1  to @xmath0  using eqn .",
    "[ eqn : sfu ] ) . for a given galaxy ,",
    "if there was no stochasticity in the star formation , all points above the rms level ( right of the corresponding dashed line ) should have had observable star formation .",
    "as such , all points to the right of the rightmost dashed line can hence be regarded as giving a reliable fraction of gas that is participating in star formation .",
    "there are several points worth noting , viz .",
    "( 1 )  all pixels with gas density greater than @xmath40@xmath6/pc@xmath20 participate in star formation .",
    "interestingly , this number is identical to the threshold density for star formation of @xmath41atoms / cm@xmath20 proposed by @xcite , ( 2 )  the fraction of gas which participates in star formation decreases nearly linearly with decreasing @xmath0 ( f@xmath43 ) .",
    "( 3 )  even for a gas density @xmath44 , two orders of magnitude below the usually assumed threshold for star formation , at least 5% of the gas is observed to be forming stars .",
    "the average @xmath0  for the pixels with @xmath45@xmath6/pc@xmath20 is @xmath46 @xmath6/pc@xmath20 , and the average @xmath1  for these pixels is @xmath47@xmath6/yr / kpc@xmath48 .",
    "thus even for the densest gas in dwarf galaxies , the star formation efficiency ( i.e. @xmath1/@xmath11 ) is hence @xmath49yr@xmath4 , about a factor of two lower than the typical value for spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "fuv emission is sensitive to the sfr of intermediate mass ( @xmath50@xmath6 ) relatively long lived ( lifetime @xmath51yr ) stars .",
    "@xmath10  emission on the other hand traces the instantaneous sfr of massive ( @xmath52@xmath6 ) short lived ( lifetime @xmath53yr ) stars . for our sample galaxies we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr_cmp ] the @xmath1  as deduced from the fuv emission ( @xmath30 ) , as well as @xmath10   emission ( @xmath29 ) as a function of @xmath0  at a resolution of 400pc .",
    "( note that pixels corresponding to gas not taking part in star formation , i.e. with negative or zero fuv flux , are not included in this plot ) the best fit power laws to the @xmath10  data is given by :    @xmath54    as can be seen the @xmath29  and @xmath30   points overlap within the scatter ( indicated by the vertical line ) .",
    "nonetheless as a comparison of eqn .",
    "[ eqn : sfh ] and eqn .",
    "[ eqn : sfu ] shows",
    ", there is a significant difference ( @xmath55 , where @xmath39 is the quadrature sum of the individual errors ) in the slope of the two relationships , with the @xmath29  relation being steeper .    discrepancies between the sfr rates deduced between these two tracers have been investigated earlier by several authors , including , for e.g. @xcite .",
    "a number of explanations for the two rates to diverge have been suggested , including ( i )  stochastic paucity of high mass stars at low star formation rates .",
    "this would make @xmath29  at low star formation rates lower than @xmath30 .",
    "for example @xcite show that for star formation rates lower than @xmath56@xmath6/yr , the @xmath10  emission systematically under predicts the true sfr .",
    "( ii )  non uniform star formation rates .",
    "for example if the star formation is bursty , then a few million years after the burst all the ob stars would have died and the @xmath10  emission would once again systematically underestimate the true sfr .",
    "( iii )  leakage of ionizing photons , either out of the galaxy , or into a more diffuse region of the ism , where the resulting @xmath10  emission has too low a surface brightness to be detected ( e.g. @xcite ) . once again",
    ", this would result in the @xmath10  emission underestimating the true sfr .",
    "( iv )  variations in the imf .",
    "for example , @xcite identify correlations between @xmath30/@xmath29with global galaxy parameters like the luminosity , rotational velocity and dynamical mass , and argue that this implies an imf that varies with environment .",
    "@xcite present a model in which the underlying imf is universal , but a dependence of the most massive star formed in a cluster on the mass of the cluster leads to the total stellar population having a steeper imf than the canonical one . (",
    "v )  dust extinction .",
    "since dust extinction is more at the shorter wavelengths , under correction for dust would lead to the fuv emission underestimating the true sfr .",
    "note that in most of the above scenarios the @xmath10  emission would under predict the true star formation rate .",
    "one would expect the @xmath29to exceed @xmath30(as observed for about half of our sample ) only if ( i )  the imf is more top heavy than assumed , or ( ii )  the dust extinction has been underestimated .    to explore this issue further ,",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : rfp ] , pixel by pixel correlations of @xmath29/@xmath30(both at 150 pc resolution ) with @xmath1  and @xmath0(at 400 pc resolution ) . in each panel",
    "the hollow squares are for those galaxies for which the global @xmath29   is greater than the global @xmath30 , while the filled circles are for those galaxies for which the global @xmath29is less than the global @xmath30 . from the first panel",
    ", one can clearly see that the anti correlation between @xmath30/@xmath29and @xmath29  seen on global scales continues even on scales as small as 150pc .",
    "the right axis of the panels is the amount of differential dust obscuration required to bring the two sfr estimators into agreement . from figure",
    "[ fig : rfp ] one can see that bringing the two sfr estimators into agreement at the lowest star formation rates requires the dust obscuration to be more at @xmath10  than at fuv , which is physically implausible .",
    "it is more likely that one of the several mechanisms discussed above for suppressing the @xmath10  flux at low star formation rates is operative . at high star formation rates , where @xmath57 , the average n@xmath58/a@xmath59 required to bring the two estimators into agreement is 8 ,",
    "i.e. the gas should be about twice as dust rich as the smc ( for which n@xmath58/a@xmath59 is 16.3 from @xcite ) .",
    "if one assumes that these regions have substantial molecular gas , and that the galaxies follow the l - z relation for dwarfs ( e.g. @xcite ) , and that dust is proportional to metalicity , then the required molecular gas densities to bring the gas to dust ratio to the same value as the smc is @xmath60 , similar to the peak densities in the center of spirals , which again seems unlikely . in summary it does not appear that dust extinction is the primary cause of the disagreement between @xmath29  and @xmath30  at the high @xmath1  end .    in terms of direct observables , panel  [ b ] shows that for the same amount of fuv emission , galaxies with lower global @xmath29/@xmath30are under producing @xmath10  emission .",
    "this could either be because the galaxies have a fading starburst or because the galaxies are not producing high mass stars .",
    "@xcite find that the frequency and amplitude of star bursts in dwarfs make the former explanation unlikely .",
    "however , a more detailed calculation , and observations of a larger sample would be needed to properly settle this issue .",
    "the most striking feature of the plots however is in panel  [ c ] , which shows that galaxies with lower global @xmath29/@xmath30   do not have gas with column density @xmath61@xmath6/yr .",
    "the most straight forward interpretation of this is that massive star formation is more likely to happen in gas with high column densities .",
    "indeed , star formation models have supported such a correlation ( e.g. @xcite ) . while the linear scales that the models refer to are much smaller than those that we are dealing with here ,",
    "such a correlation is likely given that high density star forming regions are more likely to occur in regions where the overall gas density is higher .",
    "we find a clear stochasticity between the @xmath0  and @xmath1 .",
    "all gas with @xmath5@xmath6  pc@xmath7 has associated star formation . while the fraction of star forming gas decreases with decreasing @xmath0  there is no sharp `` threshold '' below which star formation is completely quenched .",
    "we also find that galaxies for which globally @xmath62 are marked by not having high hi column density ( i.e. @xmath45@xmath6  pc@xmath7 ) gas .",
    "this is consistent with models in which formation of high mass stars preferentially happens in regions with high gas column density .",
