    "clusters of galaxies are the largest bound structures in the universe , and the most recently formed ones according to the very successful cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmology . as such",
    ", their dm haloes are expected to be less evolved and more aspherical than , say , galaxy - size haloes .",
    "most gas in clusters dm haloes has not had time to cool , and since it is gravitationally subdominant , we can expect it to reflect the underlying 3d shape of their dark matter haloes .",
    "indeed , large samples of x - ray clusters have been known to show a broad distribution of ellipticities in their surface brightness ( sb ) maps since the work of @xcite . a comparison of theoretical predictions to such observations ,",
    "now that basic parameters of the underlying cosmology are known at the 10%level or better , may shed light on the basic description of the gas in clusters of galaxies .    the general expectation that in cdm - based theories dm haloes are flattened , approximately ellipsoidal , and have short - to - long axial ratios as small as @xmath4 has been known for more than 15 years now @xcite .",
    "any asphericity in the dm distribution has important effects on a variety of observed quantities . in clusters",
    "in particular , asphericity in the dark halo potential will map directly to asphericity in the gas density , and thus affect the shape of cluster x - ray isophotes and sunyaev ",
    "zeldovich ( sz ) isodecrement contours .",
    "much subsequent work since these pioneering studies aimed at understanding the origin of such spatial anisotropy , the influence of the cosmological model on axial ratios , and improving the resolution with which the formation of dm haloes was followed @xcite .",
    "recently , higher resolution dissipationless simulations have made it possible _ to fully characterize the scatter and mean of axial ratios _ , as a function of both mass and epoch @xcite .",
    "* hereafter js ) calculated for the first time axial ratios for isodensity shells , using cosmological simulations with @xmath5 particles .",
    "they confirmed that haloes are approximately ellipsoidal in isodensity contours , and have provided fits for the dependence of axial ratios on mass and epoch . because the isodensity contour method requires a large number of particles , js restricted their analysis to haloes more massive than @xmath6 in their @xmath0cdm simulation .",
    "@xcite have obtained better statistics for haloes more massive than @xmath7 from a hubble volume simulation .",
    "we ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) have studied haloes spanning the mass range @xmath8 using several simulations to properly resolve and adequately sample the halo population in this entire mass range .",
    "our results are consistent with those of js for haloes of low  mass clusters , but yield a steeper mass dependence of axial ratios than a simple extrapolation of the scaling relations found by js .",
    "this difference is important in the interpretation of observations on galaxy scales @xcite and , as we show here ( section  [ clusters ] ) , in the interpretation of x - ray ellipticities of samples containing very massive clusters .",
    "our results are in agreement with those of @xcite if axial ratios are calculated in the same manner .",
    "however , we find here that axial ratios calculated that way are not useful for predictions of cluster observables such as x - ray or sz maps ( see appendix  [ gas ] ) .",
    "a source of uncertainty in the current understanding of halo shapes is the magnitude of the effect of gas cooling on cluster dm haloes @xcite .",
    "the variety of current and future observational probes of halo ellipticity ( see paper i for a discussion ) highlights the need to connect these predictions to observations in a robust fashion . here",
    "we present an analytic method for predicting gravitational potentials and cluster gas density based on axial ratios of dark matter haloes .",
    "we test the model against a sample of 8 high  resolution hydrodynamic art simulations of 7 clusters ( mass @xmath9 ) and 1 group ( mass @xmath10 ) in the @xmath0cdm cosmology @xcite , whose highly variant morphology dependence on the line of sight we exploit to statistically test the model , and 2 additional clusters from earlier high - resolution simulations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we then apply the model to the prediction of ellipticities for cluster x - ray and sz maps .",
    "a perturbative model has been developed by @xcite , and further extended by @xcite to predict observed distributions from halo shape distributions , but it is not useful for our purposes here because the ellipticities can be quite large .",
    "in the following section we discuss the analytic model we use to predict cluster x - ray and sz morphologies , and we test it by comparing predictions for morphology of the simulation clusters ( based on their dm haloes only ) with the same observable computed directly from the gas density grid of the hydrodynamic simulations . in section  [ clusters ] we focus on observations and compare our predictions to several observational samples of cluster x - ray ellipticities .",
    "we also discuss recent papers ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) that have compared observed cluster shapes measured using x - rays and galaxy distributions to hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "we finish with a summary of our conclusions .",

    "a comparison of x - ray ellipticity measures .",
    "in this section we analyse the prediction for two statistics of cluster morphology , the mean and the dispersion of their ellipticity distribution , expected in a flat @xmath0cdm universe with @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "we first discuss the method to predict cluster ellipticities based on their dark matter haloes , and then present the comparison of the predictions to the results from the output of several high  resolution hydrodynamical simulations @xcite . in",
    "what follows , the virial radius is defined as the radius , @xmath14 , within which the the mean overdensity drops to @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "masses are defined as the mass within @xmath14 .",
    "we use a diagonalized moment of inertia tensor iteratively calculated within ellipsoids , or ellipsoidal shells , to define axial ratios for dark matter haloes @xcite .",
    "axial ratios @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) are calculated by diagonalizing the tensor @xmath19 thereby determining @xmath20 and @xmath21 for the next iteration .",
    "the sum is over all particles within a given shell @xmath22 $ ] , or the ellipsoid interior to r , and the iteration starts with @xmath23 . in paper",
    "i we have found that this method predicts axial rations that agree with the results of js , which are based on isodensity shells , for cluster  size haloes , provided that the axial ratios be calculated within an ellipsoid of semi - major axis @xmath24 . here we also find that the same axial ratios can be used to predict fairly accurately the mean and dispersion of the expected x - ray ellipticities , even though as often as half the time the predicted ellipticity of an individual cluster is off by more than 20% .",
    "the x - ray surface brightness of an isothermal cluster is given by an integral over the gas density squared along the line - of - sight ( los ) of a cluster , sb @xmath25 .",
    "as discussed in appendix  [ gas ] , under the assumptions of hydrostatic equilibrium and isothermality , the gas density at any point inside a triaxial homeoidal halo can be written in terms of the temperature @xmath26 , the central gas density , and the halo potential at the desired point ( eq . [ rhogas ] ) .",
    "if we assume that the halo potential is dominated by the dark matter , then the relation is simplified by the fact that the potential of any triaxial generalized nfw halo is analytic ( appendix  [ potential ] ) .",
    "thus , using the relation ( [ rhogas ] ) , we can estimate the x - ray ellipticities implied by a dark matter halo given the halo axial ratios , and an orientation of a los corresponding to each of the simulation  box axes .",
    "the only ( slight ) ambiguity in relating the gas density to the halo potential is the the factor @xmath27 in equation [ rhogas ] , which relates the gas density to the potential exponentially : @xmath28 . in appendix",
    "[ xray ] , we find that the analytic model works relatively well with @xmath29 when we compare to two high - resolution clusters .",
    "this is roughly expected for an nfw halo since @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the los velocity dispersion . in the second step",
    "we have used @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are spherical - nfw - fit parameters for the halo , and assumed the expected energy scaling , @xmath36 , which is even seen observationally ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , albeit with a fair amount of scatter .",
    "the final step follows from rough scaling relations , and works in detail for the clusters we consider in appendix  [ xray].cdm ) cluster discussed there , @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) km / s .",
    "the dispersion inside the relevant projected radius ( @xmath39 kpc ) for these clusters is similar to these values . for the scdm cluster",
    ", the dispersion is @xmath40 km / s ( @xmath41 km / s , @xmath42 km / s ) along the x  axis ( y  axis , z  axis ) .",
    "for the @xmath0cdm cluster , we find @xmath43 km / s ( @xmath44 km / s , @xmath45 km / s ) .",
    "the higher @xmath32 along the y  axis is due to a merger nearly along this axis ; however , the same @xmath27 chosen to fit the radial fall  off in surface brightness in the plane perpendicular to the x  axis works well for the other two axes . ] therefore , for our comparisons we assume @xmath46 and use @xmath47 . for the dark matter halo of the scdm ( @xmath0cdm ) cluster ,",
    "we find a value of @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) for the rhs of this equation , using the average temperature of the gas inside a radius of @xmath39 kpc .",
    "for a given dark matter halo , the method discussed above allows us to compute the sb map expected for a given los through that halo .",
    "we discuss in appendix  [ xray ] how an x - ray ellipticity can the be obtained from the sb map .",
    "there is no unique method to calculate ellipticities and , as we discuss below and in appendix  [ xray ] , it is important to follow the procedure chosen by observers to calculate ellipticities in order to compare to observations . _ individual _ ellipticities can differ _ substantially _ depending on what part of a map the procedure selects and , as we show below , _ even the means _ ( of samples of ellipticities calculated with different procedures ) _ will differ_.    figure  [ allcl.sbmaps ] shows sb maps for 8 high  resolution _",
    "adiabatic _ hydrodynamic simulations of clusters in the @xmath0cdm cosmology ( see * ? ? ?",
    "each row in the figure shows the 3 sb maps corresponding to a los parallel to each of the coordinate axes of the simulation box containing the cluster .",
    "we calculate the sb for a given `` pixel '' in each box by summing @xmath50 over all cells along the los  axis .",
    "each cell is @xmath51 kpc on the side , and each map covers @xmath52 mpc on the side .",
    "the x - ray ellipticity , @xmath53 , shown in the upper right corner of each map , is calculated using the pixels ( shown by the shaded areas ) containing 20% of the total flux above a threshold flux that is 1% of the peak flux of the map .",
    "this is one of the procedures we consider in this work to calculate ellipticities from a sb map .",
    "it is a method that in the absence of noise yields ellipticities that reflect the potential of the dm halo , as we show in the next paragraph .",
    "@xcite used this method in their study of x - ray ellipticities .",
    "however , we find below ( see section  [ clusters ] ) that their data are heavily affected by noise and do not serve as a test of the @xmath0cdm cosmology",
    ". a more detailed discussion of methodologies is presented in appendix  [ xray ] .    for each cluster halo we can use the method described in section  [ method ] to compute the predicted sb map for a given los through a given cluster .",
    "we can then compute the predicted x - ray ellipticity in exactly the same manner we computed the ellipticity for the hydrodynamic simulation maps of figure  [ allcl.sbmaps ] . in figure  [ hydrovsmodel ]",
    "we show a comparison of the two ellipticities .",
    "each point in the figure plots the ellipticity shown in figure  [ allcl.sbmaps ] against the ellipticity calculated based only on the dm halo parameters .",
    "a kolmogorov  smirnov ( ks )",
    "test gives high probability ( @xmath54 ) that the two sets represent the same distribution .",
    "we treat the value of @xmath53 for each los as an independent measurement because for a given axial ratio @xmath20 there is quite a degree of variability expected for the other axial ratio , and then there is the variation introduced by the orientation of the cluster to the los .",
    "there is indeed quite a degree of variation in @xmath53 for each cluster , but a stronger test will only be possible with many more simulations .",
    "the means of the sets indeed agree quite well : @xmath55 , whereas @xmath56 . however , the dispersions differ significantly : @xmath57 , whereas @xmath58 .",
    "this is due to the middle map in the last row of figure  [ allcl.sbmaps ] , whose ellipticity is greatly enhanced by a secondary lump that in this case has a significant relative weight due to fact that the flux levels select a narrow region of the main cluster . without that map , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 ( recalculating the ellipticity without the lump , @xmath61 and @xmath60 ) .",
    "the remaining difference between @xmath60 and @xmath58 seems to be due to the fact that the gas reflects the changing triaxiality in the inner region of dm haloes .",
    "we tested this by recalculating @xmath62 using axial ratios for the dm haloes calculated within @xmath63 , in which case we find @xmath56 and @xmath64 .",
    "thus , the analytic model can be used to make fairly robust predictions of average x - ray ellipticities .",
    "an equally robust prediction of the expected scatter does not seem possible with a simple homeoidal model of dm haloes , but its reliability might be checked by calculating two sets of ellipticities based on dm halo axial ratios calculated within two different radii . we have used the model , then , to calculate the mean and dispersion of x - ray ellipticities expected in a @xmath0cdm universe at the present epoch .",
    "we use a sample of 46 dm haloes extracted from the @xmath65 mpc dissipationless cosmological simulation discussed in paper i. the cosmology is a flat @xmath0cdm universe with @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 and the simulation followed @xmath5 particles of mass @xmath66 .",
    "all haloes with virial mass @xmath67 were selected .",
    "we calculate their axial ratios and concentrations in order to predict x - ray ellipticities for a los corresponding to each of the coordinate axes of the box .",
    "the ellipticity is computed as described above , using two flux levels .",
    "the samples corresponding to each los agree quite well with each other . for the combined sample",
    "we find @xmath68 where the errors are calculated by bootstrap resampling .",
    "these results are consistent with those for the hydrodynamic simulation clusters , for which @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the strategy to extract an x - ray ellipticity from a sb map is by no means unique , and in figure  [ strategies ] & figure  [ buote ] we present two other cases of interest here .",
    "for example , in section  [ clusters ] we discuss a sample of x - ray ellipticities obtained by @xcite who use a strategy that emphasizes the central region of a cluster ( they were interested in mergers ) . in figure  [ strategies ] we show a comparison of ellipticities ( all calculated directly from the hydrodynamic simulation maps ) using two different strategies .",
    "the ordinate is an ellipticity very similar to that of @xcite , calculated using all pixels above a flux threshold corresponding to 1% of the peak flux of the sb map .",
    "the abscissa is as in figure  [ hydrovsmodel ] .",
    "it can be seen there that they differ systematically from one another : the means differ by 14% .",
    "therefore , a direct comparison of a sample of ellipticities calculated in this fashion to our predictions , ( eq . [ prediction ] ) , is not possible .",
    "another example of interest here is the strategy used by @xcite .",
    "they calculate ellipticities using _ all _ pixels inside a smooth boundary ( i.e. the boundary is not determined by flux level ) , which is determined by applying the method of @xcite ( used without iteration in the studies of @xcite and @xcite as explained in appendix  [ xray ] ) iteratively , starting from a circle , until the ellipticity converges with a given accuracy .",
    "the semi - major axis is kept fixed .",
    "figure  [ buote ] shows a comparison of ellipticities ( all calculated directly from the hydrodynamic simulation maps ) , calculated using the methodology of @xcite ( ordinate ) and @xcite ( abscissa ) .",
    "the ellipticities agree quite well in mean value and dispersion ( @xmath71 ) , despite the fact that the methodology of @xcite uses all pixels within the elliptical window .",
    "thus , the choice of a smooth boundary ( rather than a flux  selected boundary ) makes the ellipticity samples differ in no systematic way , unlike the case of figure  [ strategies ] .",
    "a comparison of a sample of ellipticities calculated this way to our predictions , ( eq . [ prediction ] ) , is therefore possible .",
    "finally , we also explore here the reliability of the analytic model to predict the expected ellipticity of millimeter ",
    "wave maps of the sz effect ( sze ) in clusters ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which map the effective temperature decrement of the microwave background due to the hot electron gas @xcite .",
    "figure  [ allcl.szemaps ] shows decrement maps for one of the clusters in figure  [ allcl.sbmaps ] ( cl5 ) , with contours spaced by a factor of 3 ( the maps for all clusters are included as supplementary material ) .",
    "the maps are qualitatively similar to the sb maps , but the effect of changing triaxiality of the dm haloes in the region spanned by the isodecrement contours shown is more readily noticed ( because the signal is proportional @xmath72 instead of @xmath73 ) .",
    "we show in the upper right corner of each map the ellipticity obtained in the same manner as figure  [ allcl.sbmaps ] , but the decrement threshold and the percentage of signal in the pixels are chosen so that the pixels used cover a region of similar size to the corresponding region in figure  [ allcl.sbmaps ] .",
    "specifically , the decrement threshold chosen is 10% of the peak decrement in the map ( as opposed to the 1% of peak signal in figure  [ allcl.sbmaps ] ) , and the signal in all of the pixels used is 30% of the total signal above the threshold ( as opposed to the 20% in figure  [ allcl.sbmaps ] ) .",
    "the mean ellipticity and the scatter for this set are @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively ( bootstrap resampling errors ) .",
    "for the set of figure  [ allcl.sbmaps ] , but with 10% threshold and 30% flux , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively ( the difference with our 1% threshold and 20% flux prediction above is due to the changing triaxiality of dm halos ) .",
    "by contrast , the analytic model would predict nearly identical destributions .",
    "thus , although not as successful as for x - ray ellipticities , the analytic model would still be useful to predict , e.g. quantitative trends for ellipticities as a function of cluster redshift .",
    "we now turn to a quantitative comparison of the expected distribution of x - ray ellipticities in the @xmath0cdm cosmology , obtained using the analytic model we have discussed and tested here , with observational samples .",
    "here we compare our predictions to ellipticity distributions from samples of cluster x - ray observations .",
    "we first analyse the methodology employed by @xcite and @xcite to calculate ellipticities for their samples of abell clusters .",
    "we also consider briefly the sample of @xcite considered by @xcite for their comparison to observations .",
    "these samples use different methodology to calculate ellipticities , and are affected differently by resolution and noise . applying a ks test to pairs of samples ( all converted to 2d axial ratios )",
    "we find that @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) for the @xcite and @xcite samples ( @xcite and @xcite samples ) .",
    "this complicates the comparison of theoretical predictions and observations , but it is usually ignored ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . finally , we analyse a very recent data set from a nearly complete , flux  limited sample of _ rosat _ clusters discussed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite considered a sample of 51 ( mostly abell ) clusters observed by the _ einstein _",
    "ipc , for which they obtained a mean 2d axial ratio , @xmath80 , of @xmath81 and a dispersion @xmath82 . converting their axial ratios to ellipticities , @xmath83 , we obtain @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the mean and scatter differ by about 1.5 and 2.5 standard deviations , respectively , from our predictions ( eq . [ prediction ] ) .",
    "however , the method of @xcite uses all pixels above a s / n level , and therefore gives substantially more weight to the central regions of a sb map , where mergers can significantly affect the ellipticity .",
    "given our discussion of the results presented in figure  [ strategies ] , the difference in mean ellipticity ( 10% ) is entirely within the expectection given the different strategy .",
    "the agreement is somewhat surprising , however , given the potential effect that cooling within clusters could have on the dm haloes @xcite .",
    "we discuss this further below .",
    "the @xcite sample consists of 22 _ rosat _ clusters , with a range of velocity dispersions of @xmath86 km / s . converting their ellipticities to @xmath83 ,",
    "the mean and dispersion of their sample are @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the poor agreement with our prediction ( eq . [ prediction ] ) is not surprising given that their method emphasizes the cluster centre and there are three clusters in the observational sample showing strong evidence of an ongoing merger : a2804 , a2933 , and a3128 are all bimodal @xcite .",
    "we have tested that this is indeed the problem by computing ellipticities for the sample of hydro clusters discussed in section  [ stats ] , following exactly the procedure of @xcite , which first defines a flux threshold equal to the mean flux within a @xmath89 kpc radius , and then uses all pixels above the threshold .",
    "a ks test between the hydro sample of ellipticities calculated this way , and the sample of @xcite , gives @xmath90 ( the hydro sample is slightly rounder on average ) .",
    "thus we conclude that their sample is in agreement with the expectations for a @xmath0cdm universe .",
    "we have also made a comparison with the  _ einstein _ data of @xcite consisting of 49 clusters .",
    "here we can expect the comparison to be a better test on the cosmological sample because they explicitly exclude image centres , thus their shape statistic is less sensitive to mergers ( see appendix  [ xray ] ) .",
    "however , the mean and dispersion of their sample are @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "there is poor agreement with our prediction ( eq . [ prediction ] ) for the mean this time .",
    "it appears unlikely that this discrepancy could be entirely due to missing physics ( e.g. cooling ) in the simulations we have used to test the analytic model described in appendix  [ gas ] .",
    "we note that even after excluding the 3 bimodal clusters from the @xcite sample , a ks test against the @xcite sample ( once ellipticities are converted to the same definition in terms of flux ",
    "moment eigenvalues ; see appendix  [ xray ] ) rejects that they are compatible at the 96% cl .",
    "the coarser angular resolution of the  _ einstein _ data probably contributes to this disagreement .",
    "for example , we find that if we smooth the x - ray map of the @xmath0cdm cluster we discuss in appendix  [ xray ] ( see figure  [ lcdmsbmap ] ) with a gaussian window of @xmath93 kpc ( fwhm , roughly corresponding to the @xmath94 resolution of the @xcite data at the median redshift of their sample , @xmath95 ) , the x - ray ellipticities can change significantly : the entry in column 6 of table  [ tbl-1 ] would be 0.40 ( 0.23 , 0.46 ) for the x  axis ( y  axis , z  axis ) as compared to 0.43 ( 0.28 , 0.51 ) without smoothing .",
    "this is also consistent with the changes found by @xcite for 5 clusters with _",
    "einstein _ ,",
    "later analysed with _",
    "rosat _ data .",
    "we find that a 20% change in the predicted ellipticities would make them marginally compatible with the data .    a more important contribution to the difference with our predictions seems to be the effect of noise .",
    "many clusters in the @xcite sample have very small ellipticities but do not look round at all . figure  [ noise ] shows the effect of smoothing and noise on one of the clusters in figure  [ allcl.sbmaps ] ( cl7 , left ) .",
    "the noise level is at 70% of the threshold ( 1% of peak flux ) used for the calculation of @xmath53 .",
    "the automated software of @xcite allowed up to 50 islands in the x - ray map , thus this map would be accepted .",
    "the ellipticity without smoothing and noise would be @xmath96 in this case , but with smoothing and noise ( the latter making the largest difference ) @xmath97 . if we put this level of noise in all the hydro clusters , we find that the hydro sample becomes fully compatible with the @xcite sample : @xmath98 .",
    "thus , it may be that our predictions are not incompatible with this data sample .",
    "finally , we discuss the recent sample of ellipticities obtained by @xcite for the flux ",
    "limited sample of _ rosat _ clusters of @xcite . as we showed in section  [ results ] , a direct comparison to our predictions ( eq . [ prediction ] ) is in this case possible .",
    "it is worth emphasizing here that an important advantage of these data is that all the ellipticities are calculated within the _ same _ aperture ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "the mean and dispersion for the sample of @xcite are @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "the dispersion is less than expected , but only by approximately @xmath102 .",
    "however , the mean is substantially larger than expected ( by approximately @xmath103 ) .",
    "this appears to be due to the expected mass dependence of axial ratios .",
    "as discussed in paper i , dark matter haloes are systematically more triaxial the larger their mass . a simple relation was found that describes this behavior : @xmath104 ( see paper i ) .",
    "many of the clusters in the sample discussed by @xcite are much more massive than the sample of simulation clusters we used to make our predictions ( eq . [ prediction ] ) .",
    "this is to be expected because the observational sample was flux limited and , therefore , massive clusters are overrepresented ( relative to a volume  limited sample , which the simulation clusters represent ) . using the scaling relation above",
    ", we find that our prediction for the mean ellipticity of a sample of clusters with a mass function like that of the clusters analysed by @xcite would be @xmath105 ( instead of eq . [ prediction ] ) .. we then draw axial ratios for the cluster using the form of the distribution of @xmath20 and @xmath21 found in simulations ( see paper i ) . ]",
    "the remaining difference could well be a statistical fluctuation , given that the intrinsic dispersion in ellipticities is @xmath106 .",
    "thus , we can expect fluctuations @xmath107 for a sample of the size of the @xcite sample .",
    "by contrast , if we assume the milder scaling advocated by js , @xmath108 , the predicted mean ellipticity would be @xmath109 instead , which is @xmath110 lower than the observations .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that the data themselves show evidence of mass dependence , although not at a high level of confidence . if we split the data of @xcite by mass , for clusters below ( above ) @xmath111 @xmath112 and @xmath113 ( @xmath114 and @xmath115 ) .",
    "there are about equal number of clusters in each subsample .",
    "although the difference in mean value is not highly significant , it is of the magnitude expected ( 10% ) using the scaling of paper i.    we conclude from the comparison with these four data samples that the predictions for cluster x - ray shapes in the @xmath0cdm cosmology , _ assuming gas cooling has only a small effect on the shape of their dark matter haloes _ , are in good agreement with the data .",
    "a more stringent test , however , would require a larger sample of clusters and a better quantitative understanding of the effect of cooling .",
    "we have attempted to estimate quantitatively the effect of gas cooling on cluster x - ray ellipticities , which generically makes dm haloes less triaxial .",
    "we use a hydrodynamic simulation of one cluster for which cooling and star formation was abruptly terminated at redshift @xmath116 in order for the cluster to have reasonable star and gas fractions ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the effect of cooling on dm halo axial ratios for this cluster agrees very well with the _ average _ effect shown in figure 4 of @xcite .",
    "we calculated the short / long axial ratio in logarithmic radial distance bins in order to directly compare to the figure in @xcite .",
    "we find that there is good agreement in the distance range @xmath117 .",
    "therefore , we have estimated the expected effect on x - ray ellipticities in two ways . we can compute the change in ellipticity by comparing the ellipticities with and without cooling for this one cluster . since the change in axial ratios seems to be representative of the expected average change",
    ", we can estimate that the effect would be to make x - ray ellipticities 1020% smaller .",
    "we have also estimated the effect by generating a catalog of dm `` haloes '' , where a halo is represented as a set of axial ratios and a concentration .",
    "we generate axial ratios using the form of the distribution of @xmath20 and @xmath21 found in simulations ( we use @xmath118 and @xmath119 for the gaussian distribution of @xmath20 ; paperi ) .",
    "we generate concentrations using the lognormal distribution of @xcite , with mean of @xmath120 and a log  dispersion of @xmath121 .",
    "finally , we orient randomly the principal axes in a box .",
    "a mean short / long axial ratio @xmath118 instead of @xmath122 adequately represents the effect seen on average by @xcite , and the effect on the cluster discussed here .",
    "we find in this case that we can expect x - ray ellipticities to be @xmath123 smaller .",
    "it is thus rather surprising that we find the level of agreement with the data that we have found here _ without _ taking the effect of cooling into account .",
    "we have considered a lower@xmath124 cosmology , in which dm halos are predicted to be more triaxial ( see paper i ) , as a possible explanation of this surprising result .",
    "if dm halos were more triaxial , the predicted x - ray ellipticities would increase and then cooling could bring results into agreement with the data .",
    "we have found in paper i that a simple scaling relation accounts for the dependence of axial ratios on @xmath124 ( see paper i , eq.(7 ) ) .",
    "the predicted @xmath125 can then be used as above to generate a catalog of axial ratios .",
    "we find that even for a value of @xmath124 as low as @xmath126 , the expected mean x - ray ellipticity of a sample like the @xcite sample changes only to @xmath127 ( from @xmath105 for @xmath128 ) .",
    "there are potential biases that can affect comparisons of the model with observations .",
    "for example , in relaxed cooling flow clusters the temperature decreases toward the center in the cluster core ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "line emission of low - temperature x - ray gas can significantly alter the @xmath50 weighting assumed in our analysis and , therefore , the shape of the x - ray brightness isophotes . to take this effect into account , however , we need to know the temperature and metallicity distribution in clusters .",
    "we plan to address this issue in future work , which will make use of the cluster simulations with galaxy formation .",
    "however , @xcite have calculated ellipticites in annuli as well , i.e. excluding the cluster centers altogether . the mean ellipticity is only slightly ( 4% ) higher .",
    "another possible source of bias can arise in comparisons with the shape estimates based on the isophotes defined at a constant fraction of the peak flux of the cluster .",
    "the profiles of real clusters are often quite `` cuspy '' in their centers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and are considerably steeper than the radial gas density profiles of clusters in our adiabatic simulations .",
    "this difference in the radial gas distribution will result in different radii of the isophotes defined with respect to the peak flux .",
    "this may mean that the shapes would be measured at systematically different radii in simulations and observations ( smaller radius in observations ) .",
    "note , however , that @xcite calculate ellipticities within the same apperture , as we have stressed above .    two qualitative trends in x - ray maps appear to reflect the more complex nature of dark matter",
    "haloes seen in high resolution simulations .",
    "* and references therein ) have pioneered detailed studies of x - ray maps to constrain cluster halo profiles .",
    "they studied 5 abell clusters using oblate and prolate spheroids in order to bracket the possibilities , and concluded that the ellipticity ( there is only one axial ratio if one assumes oblate and prolate spheroids ) of the haloes was constrained to be in the range @xmath129 .",
    "the systematic trend of interest here is that 4 of the 5 clusters show a decreasing ellipticity of the x - ray isophotes at larger radii .",
    "a similar trend can be seen in the gas data for the two high  resolution simulation clusters discussed in appendix  [ xray ] ( see figure  [ lcdmsbmap ] and figure  [ scdmsbmap ] ) and is due to the decreasing triaxiality of the dark matter halo at larger radius .",
    "the effect is not very pronounced , so the simple isothermal / homeoidal halo model could still be used for the ellipticity comparison above .",
    "the same is not true , however for sunyaev  zeldovich decrement maps ( see figure  [ szemap ] ) .",
    "as discussed in appendix  [ xray ] , the different sensitivity of sz maps to density and temperature ( @xmath130 ) make these observations more sensitive to our simplistic assumptions , and the simple mapping from halo shape parameters will break down more visibly .",
    "more detailed modeling will likely be required to interpret sz shape measurements accurately .",
    "a second complication of interest here was noted by @xcite , who pointed out that a fraction ( @xmath131 ) of their clusters exhibited isophotal twist with a `` continuous rotation of the intermediate isophotes '' . we have found that one of the high - resolution simulation clusters discussed in appendix  [ xray ] ( see figure  [ scdmsbmap ] ) shows this kind of twist due to coherent twist of the dark matter density shells . of course",
    ", it will be interesting to quantify the frequency of this effect , as well as its origins .",
    "the degree of misalignment in the case of this cluster ( @xmath132 in the radial range @xmath133 ) would be rare judging by the results of js for 12 haloes .",
    "however , a direct comparison is not possible because the angles involved are not the same .",
    "therefore , while some observational quantities are somewhat insensitive to the complex non - homeoidal nature of halo structure , many observed properties are quite sensitive to changing ellipticities and twists .",
    "specifically , the higher - order trends in halo shapes may leave imprints in cluster gas that could be studied in detail by analyses of x - ray and sunyaev ",
    "zeldovich maps .",
    "clusters x - ray ellipticities can be expected to evolve with redshift due to increased halo triaxiality ( see paper i , and references therein ) .",
    "recent papers have called attention to a possible significant evolution of the ellipticity with redshift even over the nearby redshift range @xmath134 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and have claimed that cluster x - ray and optical profiles are a little less flattened than predicted by dissipationless and hydrodynamic simulations ( see @xcite ; @xcite ; and references therein ) .",
    "however , it is important to compare observational data to simulated clusters of similar mass ( the floor et al . clusters were more massive than most of the observed clusters ) and , as we have explained ( see appendix  [ xray ] ) , to mimic the way the data was treated .",
    "it is hard to draw clear conclusions when the rather different @xcite and @xcite x - ray data sets and analyses are combined , as was done by @xcite . @xcite",
    "have detected evolution in cluster morphology in a more homogeneous sample of clusters with _",
    "chandra _ data .",
    "however , the morphology is not quantified as an ellipticity , therefore we can not assess how well this observation constrains theory in our current paper .",
    "we have presented a simple analytic model to predict cluster halo gas profiles based on dark halo shapes , under the assumption that clusters are isothermal and in hydrostatic equilibrium within haloes that are homeoidal ellipsoids ( i.e. with constant axial ratios ) .",
    "we found that certain observational properties , such as ellipticities of x - ray surface brightness maps , can be adequately described by this modeling .",
    "when applied to our sample of cluster - mass haloes we find that the predicted distribution is in good agreement with observational samples of ellipticities for galaxy clusters .",
    "the agreement with the recent @xcite analysis of a complete _ rosat _ sample is especially impressive , because we found it important to take into account the predicted mass dependence of halo shape in comparing to this data sample rich in very massive clusters .",
    "the usefulness of our model is sensitive to how the observed ellipticity is defined .",
    "specifically , care must be taken to avoid definitions that make the calculated ellipticities sensitive to mergers .",
    "the shape of dark matter haloes undoubtedly can not be fully characterized by simple models with constant axis ratios . while we have used inertia - tensor derived axial ratios to characterize halo shapes in a simple way , and explored how simple assumptions about halo shapes can be used to compare to observational tracers of halo structure , we find that more detailed predictions will be required for many observational comparisons ( appendix  [ xray ] ) .",
    "for example , the isothermal / homeoidal assumption becomes less useful for comparison to measurements like sunyaev ",
    "zeldovich decrement maps .",
    "in addition , radially decreasing ellipticities can arise from the changing shape of isodensity contours with radius , and twists in x - ray isophotes can arise from misalignment of contours at large and small radius .",
    "predictions aimed at this kind of data will require a more detailed analysis of @xmath0cdm halo shapes , including a detailed characterization of halo ellipticities as a function of radius , and the frequency of isophotal twists .",

    "we shall relax all of the assumptions and work directly with the gas in two high  resolution simulations of galaxy clusters .",
    "we work out expected x - ray properties for the clusters in the simulations , and compare them to the predictions based on the model described here .",
    "we find that the model works fairly well , despite its simplifying assumptions .",
    "we further test the model statistically against a small sample of high  resolution simulation clusters in section  [ stats ] .    with the assumptions listed above",
    ", the gas density expected at a point @xmath135 inside a triaxial halo can be written in terms of the gas density at the origin , the dark matter potential @xmath136 , and the gas temperature @xmath26 .",
    "for the halo density model discussed in appendix  [ potential ] , we find it convenient to work with the potential in units of the overall factor @xmath137 .",
    "therefore , we write    @xmath138    here @xmath139 , so the constant @xmath27 is given by    @xmath140    where @xmath141 is the mean molecular weight .",
    "for clusters with galaxy velocity dispersion @xmath32 , @xmath142 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , since @xmath143 ( see section  [ stats ] ) , we can expect @xmath29 .",
    "we can use this simple model to calculate the expected x - ray sb of hot gas in a dark halo with a given potential . since we have assumed",
    "the gas is isothermal , sb @xmath144 , where the integral is calculated along the los . in appendix",
    "[ potential ] , we calculate the potential @xmath136 in the principal  axis coordinate system of the dark matter halo . therefore , in order to calculate sb we need the orientation of the los in this coordinate system .",
    "we use the conventions of @xcite , in which the los  axis is defined by azimuthal and polar angles @xmath145 and @xmath146 , respectively .",
    "we thus have the following model to predict the x - ray sb map expected for a given projection of a dark matter halo in a simulation box .",
    "we first calculate the axial ratios @xmath18 by the iterative procedure described in section  [ stats ] ; in appendix  [ xray ] we find that axial ratios calculated using a solid ellipsoid of semi  major axis @xmath147 works well to predict flux  weighted ellipticities .",
    "we also obtain from the procedure the orientation ( @xmath145 and @xmath146 ) of a given los , and the orientation ( position angle , pa ) of the projection of the shortest axis of the halo on the plane perpendicular to the los . for a given point along the los , we find @xmath148 by first rotating its coordinates in the plane by the pa .",
    "we then apply the inverse of the rotation parametrized by @xmath145 and @xmath146 @xcite .",
    "this gives us the coordinates of the point along the los in the principal  axis system , from which we obtain @xmath148 using equation ( [ rhogas ] ) .",
    "therefore , we can calculate @xmath149 numerically at any given point on the plane .",
    "we shall refer to this model for the sb as the `` analytic model '' ( even though it involves numerical integration ) , in order to distinguish its predictions from those we work out directly from the gas density in two high  resolution simulations of galaxy clusters that we analyse in appendix  [ xray ] , where we compare predictions for x - ray ellipticities .",
    "here we consider the potential of triaxial dark matter haloes with a density profile that is a simple generalization of a special case of the spherical profile introduced by @xcite .",
    "we assume that isodensity shells are homeoidal ellipsoids , i.e. with constant axial ratios @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( @xmath18 ) , and that the density profile is given by    @xmath150    where @xmath151 and @xmath152 are a scale density and radius , respectively .",

    "this was found to be a good approximation ( assuming constant axial ratios ) by @xcite for their 12 high  resolution haloes .",
    "we also find this to be a good approximation for the haloes of two high  resolution hydrodynamical simulations we discuss in appendix  [ xray ] .",
    "however , since spherical fits to large samples of haloes find deviations from this value @xcite , we also generalize the results to other values below .",
    "the potential of a thin homeoid of mass m ( axes @xmath154 ) , at a point @xmath135 outside the shell , can be written as @xcite    @xmath155    the parameter @xmath156 in equation ( [ homeoid ] ) is the parameter of the confocal ellipse passing through @xmath135 ; it is the largest root of @xmath157    since the integral ( [ homeoid ] ) can be solved analytically , we find that    @xmath158    the potential inside the homeoid is a constant @xcite , therefore it is given by @xmath159 with @xmath160 .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the flux level at the outermost contour in figure  [ lcdmsbmap ] is @xmath185 of the peak flux . at this flux level",
    "the contour is clearly rounder than the model prediction ( due to the fact that the dark matter halo gets rounder farther out , whereas the analytic model assumes constant axial ratios ) .",
    "however , pixels up to much higher flux levels ( @xmath186 of peak flux ) enter the calculation in order to accumulate 20% of the flux above this fainter threshold in the approach of @xcite .",
    "for example , for the x",
    " axis @xmath187 and @xmath188 in the flux range @xmath189 of peak flux .",
    "therefore , the model works well down to lower thresholds .",
    "the analytic model assumes that the gas is isothermal in order to predict the sb .",
    "we can check how much this is likely to affect a comparison with actual data by calculating the ellipticity from the simulation data including the temperature dependence .",
    "we find that for the flux levels considered here , the effect is rather small .",
    "for example , the entry in column 2 of table  [ tbl-1 ] would be 0.59 ( 0.23 , 0.63 ) for the x  axis ( y  axis , z  axis ) as compared to 0.61 ( 0.24 , 0.65 ) assuming isothermality .",
    "the temperature in this cluster falls by a factor @xmath190 in the radial range @xmath191 , which is consistent with observations ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , the temperature variation of the simulation gas is representative of that of real clusters .",
    "we have also tested whether using the dark matter potential of this cluster directly would significantly improve the prediction for @xmath53 .",
    "the assumptions are still the same , but the potential is calculated directly from the dark matter distribution in order to predict the gas density .",
    "we find that the results improve as follows .",
    "for example , the entry in column 3 of table  [ tbl-1 ] would be 0.53 ( 0.25 , 0.55 ) for the x  axis ( y  axis , z  axis ) instead of 0.48 ( 0.23 , 0.51 ) .",
    "finally , in order to study whether the analytic model indeed performs better in the absence of a merger , we have analysed in the same manner a high  resolution simulation cluster that does not have an ongoing merger .",
    "it is a scdm cluster discussed in detail by @xcite . in figure  [ scdmsbmap ]",
    "we show the sb map calculated as in figure  [ lcdmsbmap ] , and in table  [ tbl-2 ] we show the results for the ellipticity . for this cluster @xmath192 and @xmath193 , therefore @xmath29 as before . in this case",
    "the model works reasonably well for either one of the definitions of ellipticity , provided that the flux threshold is sufficiently high . for faint thresholds the model fails to reproduce the trend of rounder and twisted sb contours in the simulation ( for los = y  axis , the reverse trend in table  [ tbl-2 ] is due to the chance projection of a distant hot spot that appears only at a level @xmath194 of peak flux ) .",
    "it is in fact the twisted sb contours that cause most of the difference between model and simulation gas .",
    "this is due to the fact that isodensity shells are fairly misaligned in this case .",
    "the projected , @xmath195 kpc  thick isodensity shell of @xmath39 kpc ( @xmath196 kpc , @xmath197 kpc ) semi - major axis makes a @xmath198 ( @xmath199 , @xmath200 ) angle with the vertical direction in figure  [ scdmsbmap ] .",
    "such large misalignments were found to be rare by @xcite , therefore we assume here that the model also works down to the faint threshold level of @xmath194 of peak flux in the absence of a merger , and for both ellipticities .    in section  [ clusters ]",
    "we analyse the expected distribution of x - ray ellipticities for cluster  mass haloes in the cosmological box discussed in section  [ stats ] .",
    "we calculate ellipticities using the analytic model , and compare the distribution to the data of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have also considered the reliability of the analytic model to predict the shape of sze maps of clusters . in figure  [ szemap ]",
    "we show `` temperature decrement '' maps for the two clusters we have discussed .",
    "the solid lines show contours of constant value of @xmath201 ( spaced by factors of 3 ) .",
    "the integration is along a los parallel to the x  axis of the corresponding simulation box , as was the case in figures  [ lcdmsbmap ] and [ scdmsbmap ] .",
    "since the dependence on gas temperature is linear in this case , we can expect a more significant effect of temperature on the shape of isodecrement contours .",
    "the top panels of figure  [ szemap ] compare the shape of the contours of constant value of @xmath202 only ( dashed lines ) to decrement contours .",
    "both sets of solid contours are calculated directly from the gas and temperature data of the corresponding simulation .",
    "it can be seen that in the presence of a merger ( the @xmath0cdm cluster case ) the temperature dependence indeed makes the isodecrement contours noticeably different from contours of @xmath202 .",
    "however , in the absence of a merger ( the scdm cluster case ) they agree fairly well in shape .",
    "for example , the ellipticity @xmath203 , calculated using the signal between the second and third contours , is @xmath204 ( @xmath205 ) for the scdm ( @xmath0cdm ) cluster .",
    "the ellipticities calculated using the gas density alone are @xmath206 and @xmath207 , respectively .",
    "thus , analytic models to calculate @xmath208 assuming isothermal gas will err by a large margin in the presence of a merger , _ even if @xmath208 is calculated outside the core region_. this is unlike what we have found for x - ray ellipticities .",
    "furthermore , even in the absence of a merger , the changing triaxiality of the dark matter halo makes model predictions for ellipticity in the sz maps miss the values @xmath208 by a larger margin than in the case of x - ray ellipticity .",
    "the bottom panels of figure  [ szemap ] show the predictions of the analytic model for @xmath202 ( dotted lines ) compared to the `` isodecrement contours '' of the top panels ( solid lines ) .",
    "it can be seen there that , even in the absence of a merger ( left ) , the ellipticity of the analytic model contours is too large ( even if compared to the simulation  data contours for @xmath202 only ( dashed  lines of top panels ) .",
    "for example , the ellipticity between the second and third contours of the analytic model predictions is @xmath209 ( @xmath210 ) for the scdm ( @xmath0cdm ) cluster .",
    "we find similar results for the other los .",
    "thus , reliable predictions ( i.e. within 10% of gas  data values ) for ellipticity in sze maps need to incorporate the changing triaxiality of the dark matter haloes .",
    "however , the model is still useful to predict statistics of cluster samples such as the mean and dispersion .",
