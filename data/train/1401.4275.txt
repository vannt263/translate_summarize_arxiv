    "one studies wave functions , also known as probability amplitudes , on the space of connections .",
    "unfortunately , the lack of a measure on such a space poses the first challenge , since in such case probabilities can not be defined .",
    "one typical solution to obtain a measure on the connection space comes from spaces of progressively refined cylindrical functions . in another description ,",
    "one uses a finite set of curves to probe the space of @xmath0-connections to obtain a finite dimensional manifold that depend on the sets of curves . by successively refining the finite sets of curves , such as successive triangulation of the manifold , one obtains a pro - manifold that extends the original space of connections to the so - called space of generalised connections @xcite . as a step to quantising gravity in the ashtekar framework , there are recent developments of describing such an extended space of connections using a spectral triple in noncommutative geometry @xcite , which captures the geometry of the space of generalised connections as operators on a hilbert space . while the geometries of the base manifold and the space of @xmath0-connections on it are in theory retained , the construction of the spectral triple is considered too discrete to practically allow one to recapture the geometry of the base manifold and its @xmath0-connections .",
    "to rid the discrete description of using finite sets of embedded curves , this article proposes an alternative approach to smoothly probe the space of connections using the tangent groupoid . and then followed by an application of strict deformation quantisation in @xmath1-algebraic formalism , a possible semi - classical limit of can be obtained .",
    "the purposes of this article are to present an alternative idea to the studies of loop quantum gravity with the goal of obtaining a semi - classical limit , which is what loop quantum gravity still lacks today .",
    "this article contains six small sections , they are arranged as follows : section  [ sec2 ] discusses the traditional way of putting a measure on the space of connections in loop quantum gravity literature , and the short coming of such a method . in section  [ sec3 ] , we review the definitions of a lie groupoid , a lie algebroid , and tangent groupoid of a lie groupoid in an elementary way .",

    "the lack of a semi - classical limit in loop quantum gravity has been a long standing problem .",
    "the main obstacle of obtaining such a limit is by nature how one traditionally constructs a measure on the space of connections  probing the connection space with a collection of finite graphs as described in section  [ sec2 ] .",
    "finite graphs are very rigid and discrete , they do not provide a parameter that one usually encounters in quantum theory to adjust . as a result , obtaining",
    "a semi - classical limit simply becomes impossible if a `` smoother '' way of probing the connection space is not introduced . to come up with a smooth way of probing the connection space , we understand this probing procedure as evaluating some one - dimensional objects , which is a groupoid .",
    "thus , by using a smooth groupoid , or more specifically a lie groupoid , one has a hope of circumventing the discreteness problem .",
    "the proposal we give here is the tangent groupoid .",
    "as it turns out , when the right tangent groupoid is used , the space of connections includes into the groupoid .",
    "from there , one could deform the connections to convolution operators acting on a hilbert space .",
    "this formalism recreates some elements appear in the noncommutative standard model @xcite in the way that , the gauge group is the unitary part of the algebra in the spectral triple of noncommutative standard model , the hilbert space remains the same , and the connections are realized as trace - class operators , with the trace being a gauge invariant quantity that resembles the loop variables in loop quantum gravity literature .",
    "the tangent groupoid provides another important feature concerning deformation , which is the strict deformation quantisation result of landsman @xcite .",
    "deformation quantisation can naturally be formulated in terms of @xmath1-algebraic language , a theorem due to landsman shows that a tangent groupoid gives rise to a deformation quantisation in the strict sense . by combining landsman s result and our realization of connections using tangent groupoids , we obtain a deformation quantisation of @xmath0-connections . and this quantisation formalism permits the existence of a parameter @xmath112 , so that when @xmath244 , one retrieves the classical connections .",
    "however , this is not the end of the story .",
    "since connection variables are only half of the variables in gravity in arnowitt - deser - misner formulation , one still has to look into the other half of the variables that the connections are conjugate dual to , tetrads or metrics .",
    "it is known that tetrads are quantised to degree one differential operators @xcite , and its semi - classical limit can be obtained from the @xmath249 limit of integral kernel of the differential operator multiplied by @xmath112 , which gives nothing but the symbol of the differential operator @xcite . in the case of the manifold @xmath55 being three dimensional , the symbol is an @xmath250-valued function the poisson manifold @xmath232 .",
    "hence the symbol of the differential operator lives in the same space as a connection does . following up the work of deformation quantisation of connections here , the next step is to examine the interaction of the tetrads with the connections at both the classical level @xmath244 and the quantum level @xmath202 . at @xmath251 ,",
    "one needs to examine the poisson bracket of a connection and a symbol ( of a differential operator ) , and determine which symbol is conjugate dual to a given connection . at @xmath202 ,",
    "one repeats the same procedure except now that the poisson bracket is replaced with a commutator .",
    "we will leave those considerations to another article .",
    "finally , the author would like to stress that the line of work here is toward obtaining a semi - classical limit in loop quantum gravity , and this tangent groupoid application has not been seriously considered before , thus the work here may appear incomplete .",
    "nonetheless , the development so far shows that a semi - classical limit in loop quantum gravity is more within reach than before ."
