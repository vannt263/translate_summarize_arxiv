    "in general , on one hand , eclipsing binary systems ( hereafter ebs ) provide the means for the calculation of stellar absolute parameters and evolutionary status . on the other hand ,",
    "pulsating stars reveal the ` secrets ' of the stellar interior with their oscillating behaviour .",
    "thus , the cases of binaries with a @xmath0  scuti component can be considered as extremely important because they combine information of two different types of stellar variability , which is very useful for the complete study of interacting stellar evolution .",
    "@xcite firstly suggested that the binary systems with mass gain pulsators must be considered as a new category of variables , which they named it as ` oscillating eclipsing algol - type stars ' ( oea stars ) .",
    "up to date , only @xmath2 binaries containing a @xmath0  scuti component have been discovered , but their number is rapidly increasing , especially due to the large amount of data from space telescopes ( i.e. _ kepler _ , _ corot _ ) . @xcite",
    "published the first list of candidate systems of this type , while @xcite made a first attempt to find a correlation between orbital ( @xmath3 ) and pulsation ( @xmath4 ) periods for these systems .",
    "@xcite , after a 5  yr survey on these candidates ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , based on a larger sample , found a more accurate connection between @xmath3-@xmath4 and also other correlations between the properties of pulsators and their host systems .",
    "up to 2013 , only works based on observational data had been published , but @xcite presented the first theoretical establishment for the @xmath5 connection .    in the present work ,",
    "we firstly report the discoveries of usno - a2.0 0975 - 17281677 (= ucac4  515 - 117553 = 2mass  19573100 + 1254164 = czev331  aql , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) and usno - a2.0  1200 - 03937339 (= ucac4 605 - 026193 = 2mass  05515747 + 3054538 = czev354 aur , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) as eclipsing systems and then we focus on their pulsating components .",
    "the only available information for these objects comes from general catalogues . in particular , for usno - a2.0 0975 - 17281677 the _",
    "catalogue @xcite gives the magnitude in @xmath10-filter as 13.497 and a @xmath11 value of 0.452 , while the _ 2mass all - sky catalog of point sources _ @xcite gives @xmath12 .",
    "for usno - a2.0 1200 - 03937339 the same catalogues refer @xmath13=14.528 , @xmath11=0.354 , and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "v729  aql ( @xmath13=13.756_ucac4 _ catalogue ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was discovered as a variable with a period of @xmath15 by @xcite , but no other studies exist so far .",
    "the only information for this system comes from @xcite , who calculated its mass ratio as 0.52 and classified its components as a3 and g0iv .",
    "2mass all - sky catalog of point sources _ @xcite gives @xmath16 , while the @xmath17 @xcite and the @xmath18 @xcite catalogues give @xmath11 values of 0.36 and 0.39 , respectively .",
    "for v729  aql and usno - a2.0  1200 - 03937339 a light curve ( hereafter lc ) modeling , as well as , a rough estimation for their absolute parameters and their present evolutionary status are presented .",
    "for all systems , we used fourier transformation methods on their lc residuals after subtracting the binarity effects to detect the oscillating frequencies of their pulsating components . finally , these pulsators are compared with others with similar properties . in all following tables",
    "formal errors are indicated in parentheses along - side adopted values .",
    "the observations of the systems ( available online at : http://var2.astro.cz/en/obslog.php under ` pavel caga ' ) were carried out at the bsobservatory ( zln , czech republic ) with a 25  cm netwonian reflector ( f/5.4 ) equipped with the g4 - 16000 ccd camera .",
    "the field - of - view ( fov ) for this setup was @xmath19 .",
    "as the aim of these measurements was searching for new variables , observations were made without filtering to gain the highest possible throughput , therefore the following results concern ` white'-observations .",
    "individual exposures were 240  s or 180  s long depending on seeing and transparency of the particular observing night .",
    "differential aperture photometry as well as the calibrations were performed using the c - munipack software package @xcite . for each system",
    "the selected comparison star was one of the several carefully chosen potential ones in the fov .",
    "its selection was based on its @xmath11 index , in order to be close to the index of individual observed star and thus to correct for atmospheric extinction .",
    "given that the fovs of all targets were quite dense , we carefully examined the possibility of blend on each one . for",
    "usno - a2.0 1200 - 03937339 we examined the star shape in both our frames ( @xmath20/px ) as well as in the publicly available sdss dr7 data @xcite with @xmath21/px in @xmath22 and @xmath23 filters , but we did not find any star image deformations hinting a possible blend . on the other side , the shape of usno - a2.0 0975 - 17281677 is obviously prolonged on images from our telescope , indicating another star is at least partially projected to the photometric aperture .",
    "however , we repeated the photometry with various small enough apertures ( 1 - 3 px ) to make sure that both algol - type and @xmath0  scuti - type variations originate in the single star only .",
    "the shape of v729  aql is rounded without any visible trace of another close star on our images . in table",
    "[ tabobslog ] we present the detailed observations log , which contains : the total nights of observations and their dates , the data points acquired and their mean photometric error ( standard deviation ) , and the names as well as a few properties of the comparison stars used .",
    "we used the software minima  v2.3 ( nelson 2009 ) to calculate the times of minima which are listed in table  [ tabtom ] .",
    "for usno - a2.0 0975 - 17281677 the minimum timings are not enough to determine its period with high accuracy , however , their time difference sets an upper limit of 12.0664  days . using this value and all its integer submultiples for phasing the data we found that the most possible period value is 3.0155  days . finally , we derived the first preliminary ephemeris of the system as : @xmath24 for usno - a2.0 1200 - 03937339 the amount of minimum timings was sufficient for deriving its ephemeris .",
    "thus , using the least squares method on these minima we found the following ephemeris : @xmath25 finally , for v729  aql we used our calculated time of minimum as reference and the literature period for the derivation of its ephemeris : @xmath26",
    "unfortunately , @xmath27 of the lc of usno - a2.0 0975 - 17281677 was not covered by our observations .",
    "in particular , the critical phaseparts of the deepest part of the secondary minimum and the beginning of the descending part of the primary eclipse are totally missing . for this reason , we decided not to present any photometric model .",
    "however , the phased data based on the preliminary ephemeris ( see section  [ obs ] ) are plotted in fig .  [ figlcs ] .",
    "on the other hand , full lcs for usno - a2.0  1200 - 03937339 and v729  aql were obtained .",
    "the lc of each system was analysed using all individual observations with the _ phoebe _ v.0.29d software @xcite , that is based on the wilson - devinney ( w - d ) code @xcite . in the absence of spectroscopic mass ratio , the ` @xmath28-search ' method with a step of 0.1 ( cf .",
    "* ) was applied in modes 2 ( detached system ) , 4 ( semi - detached binary with its primary component filling its roche lobe ) and 5 ( conventional semi - detached binary ) to find feasible ( ` photometric ' ) estimates for the mass ratio .",
    "after the finding of the most possible @xmath28 , this value was set as adjustable parameter in the subsequent analysis for further converging .",
    "the ( linear ) limb darkening coefficients , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , were taken from @xcite ; the dimensionless potentials @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the fractional luminosity of the primary component @xmath33 , and the system s orbital inclination @xmath34 were set as adjustable parameters .",
    "given that our data are ` white ' , the filter depended parameters ( i.e. @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) correspond to bolometric values ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the temperatures of the primary components ( @xmath38 ) were assumed according to the colour indices of the systems as given in the literature ( see section  [ intro ] ) based on the colour index - temperature - spectral type correlations of @xcite .",
    "therefore , initially a primary s temperature @xmath38 of 7000  k ( f2 spectral class ) for usno - a2.0 1200 - 03937339 and 6900  k ( f3 spectral class ) for v729  aql were set , while the temperatures of secondaries ( @xmath39 ) were adjusted .",
    "however , the distance of usno - a2.0  1200 - 03937339 has been estimated as 2300  pc @xcite , therefore its colour indices might have been affected by interstellar reddening .",
    "for this reason , we made various models for the system inside the temperature range @xmath40  k with a step of 250  k. for each model we took into account the change of the bolometric albedos @xmath41 and gravity darkening coefficients @xmath42 .",
    "particulary , for radiative stellar atmospheres we assumed @xmath41=1 and @xmath42=1 @xcite , while for convective ones @xmath41=0.5 and @xmath42=0.32 @xcite .",
    "although a distance measurement is not available for v729  aql , we followed the same procedure in the range @xmath43  k with the same step .",
    "the conventional semi - detached roche geometry was found as the most appropriate mode for both systems .",
    "the final solution of each one corresponds to the model having the minimum sum of the squared residuals of the individual models made regarding the assumed temperature and the atmosphere type of the primary component . in fig .",
    "[ figlcs ] the observed points as well as the theoretical lines are plotted , while in table  [ tablcm ] are given the models parameters .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "usno - a2.0 0975 - 17281677 is an eb containing a pulsating component with its oscillation frequencies being well inside the typical range of the @xmath0  scuti stars . according to the @xmath11 index of the system (",
    "see section  [ intro ] ) and the colour index - temperature correlation of @xcite , its temperature ranges between 6600  k-7100  k ( i.e. early f spectral type star ) , that is typical for a @xmath0  scuti star . its photometric model was not presented due to the poor coverage of its lc , however , its lc is of algol - type , but its roche geometrical configuration could not be certified",
    ". the hotter component ( primary ) is the one which is eclipsed during the primary minimum and probably this is the pulsating star of the system .",
    "it oscillates in a triple - frequency mode with the dominant one to be @xmath44  c / d .",
    "the system can be categorized either as an oea star ( if it is semi - detached ) or as a detached system with a @xmath0  scuti member .    both the spectral type and the pulsation frequencies of usno - a2.0 1200 - 03937339 lead to the conclusion that the primary star is a @xmath0  scuti star , which pulsates in five frequencies with the dominant one @xmath45  c / d .",
    "two more frequencies ( i.e. @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) in the pulsation frequency range of @xmath1  dor type stars were found and they are discussed in the following paragraphs . moreover , according to its conventional semi - detached roche configuration can be clearly categorized as an oea star .",
    "the secondary component is more evolved than the primary , it has already lost fraction of its initial mass , and up to date continues to transfer mass to the primary .",
    "the primary component of v729  aql , according to its temperature and the pulsation frequencies values , is a @xmath0  scuti star pulsating in four oscillating modes .",
    "the dominant pulsation frequency has a value 28.034  c / d , while it must be noticed that the ratio @xmath48 is @xmath49 , which is very close to the value 0.75 , that is typical for the radial fundamental and first overtone modes .",
    "similarly to usno - a2.0 1200 - 03937339 , this system is definitely an oea star , since its secondary component was found to fill its roche lobe , it has already transferred mass to the primary and probably still continues to .",
    "the pulsating components of the studied systems are presented in the @xmath3-@xmath4 diagram with other stars having similar properties for direct comparison ( see fig .",
    "[ figpp ] ) .",
    "the data for this diagram were taken from @xcite . in this plot",
    "it is shown that the pulsators of the studied systems lie well inside the periods range of the ebs with a @xmath0  scuti star - member .",
    "based on the work of @xcite , we calculated the dominant pulsations constants @xmath50 and the @xmath51 ratios for usno - a2.0 1200 - 03937339 ( 0.0123 days and 0.0276 , respectively ) and v729  aql ( 0.0159 days and 0.0278 , respectively ) . according to these values ,",
    "these systems follow well the distribution @xmath51 vs. @xmath28 of ebs with @xmath0  scuti component as drawn by @xcite , while the @xmath50 values of their primaries ( which are @xmath52  days ) show that they should pulsate in p - modes .",
    "moreover , we calculated the @xmath51 ratio for usno - a2.0 1200 - 03937339 but for the pulsation frequency @xmath46 , in order to compare it with other @xmath1  dor-@xmath0  sct hybrid stars - members of ebs . however , according to @xcite the sample of such hybrids presently consists of at most two hybrid pulsator eclipsing binaries , namely corot100866999 and possibly kic4544587 . their @xmath1  dor @xmath51 ratio of 0.223 and 0.227 , respectively , differ by an order of magnitude from the value of 2.666 that we found for usno - a2.0 1200 - 03937339 .",
    "therefore , perhaps @xmath46 and @xmath47 result from observational drifts or imperfect lc fitting rather than being intrinsic to the star .",
    "certainly , this issue remains open until the statistical sample of this type of hybrid pulsator becomes significantly larger .",
    "-@xmath4 diagram along with the @xmath0  scuti stars - members of oea stars and of detached binaries.,title=\"fig:\",width=283 ] +    we strongly suggest the multi - filtered photometric monitoring of these systems for : a ) verification of the present results , especially for the low amplitude frequencies , b ) the detection of more pulsation frequencies , and c ) the derivation of the excitation modes ( i.e. @xmath53-degrees ) . moreover , for usno - a2.0 1200 - 03937339 short - time continuous observations ( i.e. order of weeks ) are proposed in order to certify the existence of the lower frequencies , and for usno - a2.0 0975 - 17281677 systematic observations aiming for complete coverage of its lcs are suggested in order to find its geometrical characteristics .",
    "finally , spectroscopic observations are also suggested not only for the pulsations , but also for the components radial velocities curves , which will lead us to calculate their absolute properties ( i.e. masses , radii ) with high accuracy .",
