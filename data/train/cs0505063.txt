    "the starting point and conceptual basis for classical investigations in concurrency are the notions of equivalence and congruence of processes  when can two processes be considered the same and when can they be substituted for each other ?",
    "most investigations into timed  @xcite and probabilistic concurrent processes are based on equivalences of one kind or another , e.g.  @xcite to name but a few .    as has been argued before  @xcite , this style of reasoning is fragile in the sense of being too dependent on the exact numerical values of times and probabilities .",
    "previously this had pointed out for probability , but the same remarks apply , _ mutis mutandis _ , to real time as well .",
    "consider the following two paradigmatic examples :    * consider the probabilistic choice operator : @xmath0 , which starts @xmath1 with probability @xmath2 and @xmath3 with probability @xmath4 .",
    "consider @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "in traditional exact reasoning , the best that one can do is to say that all these three processes are inequivalent .",
    "clearly , there is a gradation here : @xmath7 is closer to @xmath8 than @xmath9 is to @xmath8 . *",
    "consider the @xmath10 operator that starts @xmath11 after a delay of @xmath12 time units .",
    "consider @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "again , in exact reasoning , the best that one can do is to say that all these three processes are inequivalent .",
    "again , @xmath13 is intuitively closer to @xmath10 than @xmath15 is to @xmath10 .    in both examples , the intuitive reasoning behind relative distances",
    "is supported by calculated numerical values of quantitative observables  expectations in the probabilistic case and ( cumulative ) rewards in the timed case .",
    "the fragility of exact equivalence is particularly unfortunate for two reasons : firstly , the timings and probabilities appearing in models should be viewed as numbers with some error estimate . secondly , probability distributions over uncountably many states arise in even superficially discrete paradigms such as generalized semi - markov processes ( e.g. see  @xcite for a textbook survey ) , and discrete approximations are used for algorithmic purposes  @xcite .",
    "these approximants do not match the continuous state model exactly and force us to think about approximate reasoning principles  e.g. when does it suffice to prove a property about an approximant ?",
    "thus , we really want an `` approximate '' notion of equality of processes . in the probabilistic context , jou and smolka",
    "@xcite propose that the correct formulation of the `` nearness '' notion is via a metric .",
    "similar reasons motivate the study of lincoln , mitchell , mitchell and scedrov  @xcite , our previous study of metrics for labelled markov processes @xcite , the study of the fine structure of these metrics by van breugel and worrell  @xcite and the study of alfaro , henzinger and majumdar of metrics for probabilistic games  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these papers , in the present paper we focus on real - time probabilistic systems that combine _ continuous time and probability_. we consider generalized semi - markov processes ( gsmps ) .",
    "semi - markov processes strictly generalize continuous - time markov chains by permitting general ( i.e.  non - exponential ) probability distributions ; gsmps further generalize them by allowing competition between multiple events , each driven by a different clock .    following the format of the usual definition of bisimulation as a maximum fixed point",
    ", we define a metric on configurations of a gsmp as a maximum fixed point .",
    "this permits us to use analogues of traditional coinductive methods to reason about metric distances .",
    "for example , in exact reasoning , to deduce that two states are equivalent , it suffices to produce a bisimulation that relates the states . in our setting , to show that the distance between two states is less than @xmath16 , it suffices to produce a ( metric ) bisimulation that sets the distance between the states to be less than @xmath16 .",
    "viewing metric distance @xmath17 as bisimilarity , we get a definition of bisimulation for gsmps , a class that properly includes ctmcs .",
    "in contrast to existing work on bisimulation for general probability distributions ( e.g.  @xcite ) our definition accounts explicitly for the change of probability densities over time .    secondly , we demonstrate that our study does not rely on any `` ad - hoc '' construction of metric distances .",
    "uniform spaces capture the essential aspects of metric distances by axiomatizing the structure needed to capture relative distances ",
    "e.g. statements of the form `` x is closer to y than to z. '' a metric determines a uniform space but different metrics can yield the same uniform space .",
    "uniform spaces represent more information than topological spaces but less than metric spaces , so we are identifying , as precisely as we can , the intrinsic meaning of the quantitative information .",
    "we present our maximal fixpoint construction as a construction on uniform spaces , showing that the numerical values of different metric representations are not used in an essential way .",
    "in particular , in our setting , it shows that the actual numerical values of the discount factors used in the definition of the metric do not play any essential role .",
    "thirdly , we provide a `` logical '' characterization of the uniformity using a real - valued modal logic . in analogy to traditional completeness results , we prove that the uniformity notion induced by the real - valued modal logic coincides with the uniformity induced by the metric defined earlier .",
    "our logic is intentionally chosen to prove this completeness result .",
    "it is not intended to be used as an expressive specification formalism to describe properties of interest .",
    "our framework provides an intrinsic characterization of the quantitative observables that can be accommodated  functions that are continuous with respect to the metric .",
    "finally , we illustrate the use of such studies in reasoning by showing that several quantitative properties of interest are continuous with respect to the metric .",
    "thus , if two processes are close in the metric then observable quantitative properties of interest are indeed close . for expository purposes , the list considered in this paper",
    "includes expected hitting time , expected ( cumulative and average ) rewards .",
    "the tools used to establish these results are `` continuous mapping theorems '' from stochastic process theory , and provide a general recipe to tackle other observables of interest .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin with a review of the model of gsmps in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "we then give a review of the basic ideas from stochastic process theory ",
    "metrics on probability measures on metric spaces in section  [ sec2 ] and the skorohod j2 metrics on timed traces in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "we discuss timed traces in the context of gsmps in section  [ sec - cadl ] .",
    "we define metric bisimulation in section  [ sec5 ] .",
    "we discuss interesting quantitative observables are continuous functions in section  [ sec7 ] .",
    "we present our construction in terms of uniform spaces in section  [ sec8 ] .",
    "finally , we show the completeness of the real - valued modal logic in section  [ sec6 ] .",
    "gsmps properly include finite state ctmcs while also permitting general probability distributions .",
    "we describe gsmps informally here following the formal description of  @xcite .",
    "the key point is that in each state there are possibly several events that can be executed .",
    "each event has its own clock - running down at its own rate - and when the first one reaches zero that event is selected for execution .",
    "then a probabilistic transition determines the final state and any new clocks are set according to given probability distributions : defined by conditional density functions .",
    "the probability distribution over the next states depends only on the current state and the event that has occurred : this is the `` markov '' in semi - markov .",
    "the clocks are reset according to an arbitrary distribution , not necessarily an exponential ( memoryless ) distribution : hence the `` semi '' .",
    "we will consider finite - state systems throughout this paper .",
    "a finite - state gsmp over a set of atomic propositions @xmath18 has the following ingredients :    1 .   a finite set @xmath19 of states .",
    "each state has an associated finite set of events @xmath20 , each with its own clock ( we use the same letter for an event and its clock ) and a non - zero rate for each clock in @xmath20 .",

    "let @xmath31 be a state .",
    "a * generalized state * is of the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a vector of clock values indexed by @xmath23 that satisfies a uniqueness condition : there is a unique clock in @xmath20 that reaches @xmath17 first .",
    "we write @xmath34 for the time required for the first clock ( unique by the above definition ) to reach @xmath17 .",
    "we use @xmath35 for the set of generalized states , and @xmath36 for generalized states .",

    "the remaining clocks in @xmath41 carry forward their time values from @xmath31 to @xmath24    the continuity condition on probability distributions ensures that this informal description yields a legitimate markov kernel  @xcite .",

    "the previous approaches to bisimulation work well for ctmcs , precisely because of the fact that the distribution is memoryless ; at any given instant the expected duration in a state and the transition probabilities only depend on the current state of the system , and thus one _ can _ define a bisimulation on the state space . in contrast , the problem of describing bisimulation for real - time processes that have general distributions , rather than memoryless distributions , has been vexing . in the present work ,",
    "we have shifted emphasis to the generalized states that incorporate time and not tried to define a bisimulation on the ordinary states . because the generalized states embody the quantitative temporal information we _ have to work metrically _ ; an attempt to define bisimulation directly would have fallen afoul of the approximate nature of the timing information .",
    "if we want to move to continuous state spaces and stochastic hybrid systems , the whole dynamical formalism has to be different : one can no longer think of paths as cadlag functions .",
