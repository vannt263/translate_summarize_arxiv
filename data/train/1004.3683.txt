    "low surface brightness galaxies ( lsbgs ) are important populations in the field environments .",

    "( 2005 ) , we believe that this is not a serious problem for estimating the metallicities of the sample galaxies since lsbgs may have no strong radial oxygen abundance gradients , which has been found by de blok & van der hulst ( 1998 ) .    to further check whether the presence of a stellar bulge affects the relationships among stellar mass , metallicity and surface brightness of galaxies or not , we only select those samples having fracdev@xmath59@xmath200 , which means that the galaxy could be purely disk one .",

    "most of our sample galaxies are luminous with @xmath6519 mag .",

    "( 2004 ) by using the bayesian approach .",
    "moreover , the different photoionization models used to estimate oxygen abundances could also cause some differences .",
    "they used mcgaugh ( 1991 ) which results in @xmath200.1dex lower oxygen abundances than what used by tremonti et al .",
    "in addition , the metallicities from literature come from h  ii regions which are often observed at large radii in the galaxy , whereas our measurements come from the central few kpc .",
    "if there are metallicity gradients in the galaxies then this will cause the sdss metallicities to be a bit higher .    in mcgaugh ( 1994 )",
    ", 41 h  ii regions in 22 lsbgs were obtained their o / h abundances , which are about 12+log(o / h)@xmath208.06 ( in median ) .",

    "all these galaxies have central surface brightness well below the freeman ( 1970 ) value of @xmath66 mag arcsec@xmath1 , with the sample median being 23.4 mag arcsec@xmath1 .",
    "their fig.10 shows that almost half of their samples are faint having @xmath6718 mag , which should belong to the dwarfs , and another half objects mostly have @xmath5520@xmath6819 mag ( the cosmological parameter @xmath9 has been corrected from 100 to 70 km s@xmath10 mpc@xmath10 ) .",
    "even these brighter galaxies are comparable with part of our sample galaxies in luminosity , mcgaugh ( 1994 ) used the lower branch formula of @xmath39 for metallicity estimates , thus the oxygen abundances of their samples are still lower than ours as discussed below .    another key point is which calibration ( the lower branch or upper branch one ) are used to estimate the oxygen abundances of the galaxies .",
    "mcgaugh ( 1994 ) used log([n  ii]/[o  ii])@xmath691.0 to judge that their samples belong to the lower branch of metallicity , and then used the lower branch @xmath39 formula ( mcgaugh 1991 ) to calculate the oxygen abundances of their h  ii regions .",
    "indeed their fig.3 shows that some ( almost half ) of their samples have log([n  ii]/[o  ii ] ) between @xmath551.0 and @xmath551.2 .",
    "the latter value , @xmath551.2 , is a recent recommendation ( kewley & ellison 2008 ) and is adopted here by us to separate the upper and lower branches of metallicities .    to be sure",
    "the calibration method is another main reason ( may be the most important one ) for the difference between the abundances of mcgaugh ( 1994 ) and ours , we select those of our sample galaxies having @xmath551.2@xmath4log([n  ii]/[o  ii])@xmath691.0 and re - calculate their oxygen abundances by using the same method as mcgaugh ( 1994 ) , i.e. , the lower branch @xmath39 formula from mcgaugh ( 1991 ) . the corresponding analysis formula from kobulnicky et al .",

    "<S> we study the spectroscopic properties of a large sample of low surface brightness galaxies ( lsbgs ) ( with b - band central surface brightness @xmath022 mag arcsec@xmath1 ) selected from the sloan digital sky survey data release 4 ( sdss - dr4 ) main galaxy sample . a large sample of disk - dominated high surface brightness galaxies ( hsbgs , with @xmath222 mag arcsec@xmath1 ) </S>",
    "<S> are also selected for comparison simultaneously . to study them in more details , </S>",
    "<S> these sample galaxies are further divided into four subgroups according to @xmath3 ( in units of mag arcsec@xmath1 ) : vlsbgs ( 24.5 - 22.75 ) , ilsbgs ( 22.75 - 22.0 ) , ihsbgs ( 22.0 - 21.25 ) , and vhsbgs ( @xmath421.25 ) . the diagnostic diagram from spectral emission - line ratios shows that the agn fractions of all the four subgroups are small ( @xmath49% ) . </S>",
    "<S> the 21,032 star - forming galaxies with good quality spectroscopic observations are further selected for studying their dust extinction , strong - line ratios , metallicities and stellar mass - metallicities relations . </S>",
    "<S> the vlsbgs have lower extinction values and have less metal - rich and massive galaxies than the other subgroups . </S>",
    "<S> the oxygen abundances of our lsbgs are not as low as those of the h  ii regions in lsbgs studied in literature , which could be because our samples are more luminous , and because of the different metallicity calibrations used . </S>",
    "<S> we find a correlation between 12+log(o / h ) and @xmath3 for vlsbgs , ilsbgs and ihsbgs but show that this could be a result of correlation between @xmath3 and stellar mass and the well - known mass - metallicity relation . </S>",
    "<S> this large sample shows that lsbgs span a wide range in metallicity and stellar mass , and they lie nearly on the stellar mass vs. metallicity and n / o vs. o / h relations of normal galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that lsbgs and hsbgs have not had dramatically different star formation and chemical enrichment histories .    </S>",
