    "computing an ensemble of solutions of fluid flow equations for a set of parameters or initial / boundary conditions for , e.g. , quantifying uncertainty or sensitivity analyses or to make predictions , is a common procedure in many engineering and geophysical applications .",
    "one common problem faced in these calculations is the excessive cost in terms of both storage and computing time .",
    "thanks to recent rapid advances in parallel computing as well as intensive research in ensemble - based data assimilation , it is now possible , in certain settings , to obtain reliable ensemble predictions using only a small set of realizations .",
    "successful methods that are currently used to generate perturbations in initial conditions include the bred - vector method , @xcite , the singular vector method , @xcite , and the ensemble transform kalman filter , @xcite . despite all these efforts ,",
    "the current level of available computing power is still insufficient to perform high - accuracy ensemble computations for applications that deal with large spatial scales such as numerical weather prediction . in such applications , spatial resolution",
    "is often sacrificed to reduce the total computational time . for these reasons",
    "the development of efficient methods that allow for fast calculation of flow ensembles at a sufficiently fine spatial resolution is of great practical interest and significance .",
    "only recently , a first step was taken in @xcite where a new algorithm was proposed for computing an ensemble of solutions of the time - dependent navier - stokes equations ( nse ) with different initial condition and/or body forces . at each time step",
    ", the new method employs the same coefficient matrix for all ensemble members .",
    "this reduces the problem of solving multiple linear systems to solving one linear system with multiple right - hand sides .",
    "there have been many studies devoted to this type of linear algebra problem and efficient iterative methods have been developed to significantly save both storage and computing time , e.g. , block cg @xcite , block qmr @xcite , and block gmres @xcite .",
    "even for some direct methods , such as the simple lu factorization , one can save considerable computing cost .    because the main goal of the ensemble algorithm is computational efficiency",
    ", it is natural to consider using reduced - order modeling ( rom ) techniques to further reduce the computational cost . specifically , we consider the proper orthogonal decomposition ( pod ) method which has been extensively used in the engineering community since it was introduced in @xcite to extract energetically coherent structures from turbulent velocity fields .",
    "pod provides an optimally ordered , orthonormal basis in the least - squares sense , for given sets of experimental or computational data .",
    "the reduced order model is then obtained by truncating the optimal basis .",
    "research on pod and its application to the unsteady nse has been and remains a highly active field .",
    "recent works improving upon pod have dealt with the combination of galerkin strategies with pod @xcite , stabilization techniques @xcite , and regularized / large eddy simulation pod models for turbulent flows @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study a galerkin proper orthogonal decomposition ( pod - g - rom ) based ensemble algorithm for approximating solutions of the nse .",
    "accordingly , our aim in this paper is to develop and demonstrate a procedure for the rapid solution of multiple solutions of the nse , requiring only the solution of one reduced linear system with multiple right - hand sides at each time step .",
    "the ensemble method given in @xcite is first - order accurate in time and requires a cfl - like time step condition to ensure stability and convergence .",
    "two ensemble eddy viscosity numerical regularizations are studied in @xcite to relax the time step restriction .",
    "these two methods utilized the available ensemble data to parametrize the eddy viscosity based on a direct calculation of the kinetic energy in fluctuations without further modeling .",
    "they both give the same parametrization for each ensemble member and thus preserve the efficiency of the ensemble algorithm .",
    "the extension of the ensemble method to higher - order accurate ensemble time discretization is nontrivial .",
    "for instance , the method is not extensible to the most commonly used crank - nicolson scheme . making use of a special combination of a second - order in time backward difference formula and an explicit second - order adams - bashforth treatment of the nonlinear term ,",
    "a second - order accurate in time ensemble method was developed in @xcite.another second - order ensemble method with improved accuracy is presented in @xcite .",
    "the ensemble algorithm was further used in @xcite to model turbulence . by analyzing the evolution of the model variance",

    "we introduce the reduced system so as to facilitate the analyses given in later sections .",
    "the pod model reduction scheme can be split into two main stages : an offline portion and an online portion . in the offline portion ,",
    "one collects into what is known as a snapshot set the solution of a partial differential equation ( pde ) , or more precisely , of a discrete approximation to that solution , for a number of different input functions and/or evaluated at several time instants .",
    "the snapshot set is hopefully generated in such a way that it is representative of the behavior of the exact solution .",
    "the snapshot set is then used to generate a pod basis , hopefully of much smaller cardinality compared to that of the full finite element space , that provides a good approximation to the data present in the snapshot set itself . in the online stage ,",
    "the pod basis is used to generate approximate solutions of the pde for other input functions ; ideally these will be accurate approximations achieved much more cheaply compared to the use of a standard method such as a standard finite element method .",
    "in the rest of this section , we delve into further detail about the generation of the snapshot set , the construction of the pod basis in a finite element setting , and how the pod basis can be used to construct a reduced - order model for the nse in the ensemble framework .",
    "this section will focus on the framework specific to this paper ; for more detailed presentations about pod , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the offline portion of the algorithm begins with the construction of the snapshot set which consists of the solution of the pde for a number of different input functions and/or evaluated at several different time instants .",
    "given a positive integer @xmath87 , let @xmath88 denote a uniform partition of the time interval @xmath3 $ ] .",

    "we first define the set of snapshots corresponding to exact solutions of the weak form of the nse . for @xmath91 , we select @xmath92 different initial conditions @xmath5 and denote by @xmath93 the exact velocity field satisfying , evaluated at @xmath94 , @xmath95 , which corresponds to the initial condition @xmath5",
    ". then , the space spanned by the @xmath96 so obtained snapshots is defined as @xmath97 in the same manner , we can construct a set of snapshots @xmath98 , @xmath91 , @xmath99 , of finite element approximations of the velocity solution determined from a standard finite element discretization of .",
    "note that one could also determine , at lesser cost but with some loss of accuracy , the snapshots from the ensemble - based discretization .",
    "we can then also define the space spanned by the @xmath100 discrete snapshots as @xmath101 note that @xmath102 .",
    "the snapshots are finite element solutions so the span of the snapshots is a subset of the finite element space @xmath103 .",
    "additionally , it is important to note that by construction , the snapshots satisfy the discrete continuity equation so that the span of the snapshots is indeed a subspace of the discretly divergence free subspace @xmath104 .    if we denote by @xmath105 the vector of coefficients corresponding to the finite element function @xmath106 . with @xmath107",
    ", we may also define the @xmath108 _ snapshot matrix _ @xmath109 as @xmath110 i.e. , the columns of @xmath109 are the finite element coefficient vectors of the discrete snapshots .",
    "to construct a reduced basis that results in accurate approximations , the snapshot set must contain sufficient information about the dynamics of the solution of the pde . in our context , this requires one to not only take a sufficient number of snapshots with respect to time , but also to select a set of initial conditions that generate a set of solutions that is representative of the possible dynamics one may encounter when using other initial conditions . in the pod framework for the nse , the literature on selecting this set is limited .",
    "one of the few algorithms which has been explored in the ensemble framework is the previously mentioned bred - vectors algorithm given in @xcite .",
    "further exploration of this and other approaches for the selection of initial conditions is a subject for future research .      using the set of discrete snapshots ,",
    "we next construct the pod basis @xmath111 .",
    "we define the pod function space @xmath112 as @xmath113 there are a number of equivalent ways in which one may characterize the problem of determining @xmath112 ; for a full discussion see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2 ) .",
    "for example , the pod basis construction problem can be defined as follows : determine an orthonormal basis @xmath114 for @xmath115 such that for all @xmath116 , @xmath117 solves the following constrained minimization problem @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the kronecker delta and the minimization is with respect to all orthonormal bases for @xmath115 .",
    "we note that by defining our basis in this manner we elect to view the snapshots as finite element functions as opposed to finite element coefficient vectors .",
    "define the @xmath120 correlation matrix @xmath121 , where @xmath122 denotes the gram matrix corresponding to full finite element space .",
    "then , the problem is equivalent to determine the @xmath123 dominant eigenpairs @xmath124 satifying @xmath125 where @xmath126 denotes the euclidean norm of a vector .",
    "the finite element coefficient vectors corresponding to the pod basis functions are then given by @xmath127 alternatively , we can let @xmath128 , and define @xmath129 so that @xmath130 and then determine the singular value decomposition of the modified snapshot matrix @xmath131 ; the vectors @xmath132 , @xmath133 are then given as the first @xmath123 left singular vectors of @xmath131 which correspond to the first @xmath123 singular values @xmath134 .",
    "we next illustrate how a pod basis is used to construct a reduced - order model for the nse within the ensemble framework .",
    "the discretized system that defines the pod approximation mimics that for the full finite element approximation , except that now we seek an approximation in the pod space @xmath112 having the basis @xmath135 .",
    "specifically , for @xmath7 , we define the pod approximate initial conditions as @xmath136 and then pose the following problem : _ given @xmath137 , for @xmath74 and for @xmath7 , find @xmath138 satisfying _ @xmath139 we refer to this discretization as _ en - pod _ indicating that we are referring to an ensemble - based discretization of ( 2.2 ) using a low - dimensional pod space .",
    "note that because @xmath140 , i.e. , the pod approximation is by construction discretely divergence free , the pressure term in the pod - discretized nse drops out and we are left with a system involving only the pod approximation to the velocity .",
    "one further point of emphasis is that the @xmath4 initial conditions used in are different from the @xmath92 initial conditions used to construct the snapshot set , i.e. , we use @xmath92 initial conditions to solve the full finite element system to determine the snapshots , and now solve @xmath4 additional approximations of the nse by solving the much smaller pod system .    as was the case for",
