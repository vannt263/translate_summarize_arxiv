    "there are no natural boundaries for the gravitational field analogous to the conducting boundaries that play a major role in electromagnetism . in principle , there is no need to introduce any . the behavior of the universe as a whole can be posed as an initial value ( cauchy ) problem . in an initial value problem , data is given on a spacelike hypersurface @xmath0 .",
    "the problem is to determine a solution in the future domain of dependence @xmath1 , which consists of those points whose past directed characteristics all intersect @xmath0 .",
    "the problem is well - posed if there exists a unique solution which depends continuously on the initial data .",
    "the pioneering work of y. bruhat  @xcite showed that the initial value problem for the ( classical ) vacuum gravitational field is well - posed . assuming that matter fields do not spoil things",
    ", this suggests that the global cosmological problem of treating the universe as a whole can be solved in a physically meaningful way , i.e. in a way such that the solution does not undergo uncontrolled variation under a perturbation of the initial data .",
    "this is indeed the case for the presently accepted cosmological model of an accelerating universe ( positive cosmological constant ) where the conformal boundary at future null infinity @xmath2 is spacelike . in a conformally compactified picture ,",
    "@xmath2 acts as a spacelike cap on the future evolution domain and no boundary condition is necessary or indeed allowed .    in practice",
    ", of course , treating an isolated system as part of a global cosmological spacetime is too complicated a problem without oversimplifying assumptions such as isotropy or homogeneity .",
    "one global approach applicable to isolated systems is to base the cauchy problem on the analogue of a foliation of minkowski spacetime by the hyperboloidal hypersurfaces @xmath3 in a penrose conformally compactified picture  @xcite , this foliation asymptotes to the light cones and extends to a foliation of future null infinity @xmath2 .",
    "the analogue in curved spacetime is a foliation by positive constant mean curvature hypersurfaces .",
    "since no light rays can enter an asymptotically flat spacetime through @xmath2 , no boundary data are needed to evolve the interior spacetime .",
    "in addition , the waveform and polarization of the outgoing radiation can be unambiguously calculated at @xmath2 in terms of the bondi news function  @xcite .",
    "this approach was first extensively developed by friedrich  @xcite who formulated a hyperbolic version of the einstein - bianchi system of equations , which is manifestly regular at @xmath2 , in terms of the conformally rescaled metric , connection and weyl curvature .",
    "this is potentially the basis for a very attractive numerical approach to simulate global problems such as gravitational wave production .",
    "for reviews of progress on the numerical implementation see  @xcite .",
    "there has been some success in simulating model axisymmetric problems  @xcite .",
    "more recently , there have been other attempts at the hyperboloidal approach based upon the einstein equations for the conformal metric .",
    "zenginolu  @xcite has implemented a code based upon a generalized harmonic formulation in which the gauge source terms produce a hyperbolic foliation .",
    "a mixed hyperbolic - elliptic system proposed by moncrief and rinne  @xcite has been implemented as an axisymmetric code  @xcite which produces long term stable evolutions .",
    "another hyperbolic - elliptic system based upon a tetrad approach has been developed by bardeen , sarbach and buchman  @xcite . in spite of the attractiveness of the hyperboloidal approach and its success with model problems , considerable",
    "work remains to make it applicable to systems of astrophysical interest .",
    "a different global approach is to match the cauchy evolution inside a a finite worldtube to an exterior characteristic evolution extending to @xmath4 . in this approach ,",
    "called cauchy - characteristic matching , the characteristic evolution is constructed by using the cauchy evolution to supply characteristic data on an inner worldtube , while the characteristic evolution supplies the outer boundary data for the cauchy evolution .",
    "the success of cauchy - characteristic matching depends upon the proper mathematical and computational treatment of the initial - boundary value problem ( ibvp ) for the cauchy evolution .",
    "this approach has been successfully implemented in the linearized regime  @xcite but also needs considerable additional work to apply to astrophysical systems",
    ". see  @xcite for a review .    instead of a global treatment , the standard approach in numerical relativity , as in computational studies of other hyperbolic systems , is to introduce an artificial outer boundary .",
    "ideally , the outer boundary treatment is designed to represent a passive external universe by allowing radiation to cross only in the outgoing direction .",
    "this is the primary application of the ibvp .",
    "other possible applications , which i will not consider , are the timelike conformal boundary to a universe with negative cosmological constant and the membranes which play a role in higher dimensional theories . while there are no natural boundaries in classical gravitational theory , boundaries do play a central role in the ideas of holographic duality introduced in higher dimensional attempts at quantum gravity .",
    "such applications are also beyond the scope of this review as well as beyond my own expertise . here , i confine my attention to 4-dimensional spacetime , although the techniques governing a well - posed ibvp readily extend to hyperbolic systems in any dimension .    in the ibvp ,",
    "data on a timelike boundary @xmath5 , which meets @xmath6 in a surface @xmath7 , are used to further extend the solution of the cauchy problem to the domain of dependence @xmath8 . in the simulation of an isolated astrophysical system containing neutron stars and black holes ,",
    "the outer boundary @xmath5 is coincident with the boundary of the computational grid and @xmath7 is topologically a sphere surrounding the system .",
    "however , for purposes of treating the underlying mathematical and computational problems , it suffices to concentrate on the local problem in the neighborhood of some point on the intersection @xmath7 between the cauchy hypersurface @xmath0 and the boundary @xmath5 . for hyperbolic systems , the global solution in the spacetime manifold @xmath9",
    "can be obtained by patching together local solutions .",
    "this is because the finite speed of propagation allows _ localization _ of the problem .",
    "the setting for this local problem is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : bound ] .     and @xmath5 , which intersect in the 2-surface @xmath7 , locally determine a solution in the spacetime manifold @xmath9 ]    .",
    "[ fig : bound ]    the ibvp for einstein s equations only received widespread attention after its importance to the artificial outer boundaries used in numerical relativity was pointed out  @xcite .",
    "the first _ strongly _ well - posed ibvp was achieved for a tetrad version of the einstein - bianchi system , expressed in first differential order form , which included the tetrad , connection and curvature tensor as evolution fields  @xcite .",
    "strong well - posedness guarantees the existence of a unique solution which depends continuously on both the cauchy data and the boundary data .",
    "a strongly well - posed ibvp was later established for the harmonic formulation of einstein s equations as a system of second order quasilinear wave equations for the metric  @xcite .",
    "the results were further generalized in  @xcite to apply to a general quasilinear class of symmetric hyperbolic systems whose boundary conditions have a certain hierarchical form .",
    "a review of the ibvp in general relativity must per force be of a different nature than a review of the cauchy problem .",
    "the local properties of the cauchy problem are now well understood .",
    "several excellent reviews exist  @xcite . for the ibvp ,",
    "the results are not comprehensive and are closely tied to the choice of hyperbolic reduction of einstein s equations .",
    "there are only a few universal features and , in particular , there is no satisfactory treatment of the 3 + 1 formulation which is extensively used in numerical relativity .",
    "for that reason , i will adopt a presentation which differs somewhat from the standard approach with the motivation of setting up a bare bones framework whose flexibility might be helpful in further investigations .",
    "my presentation is also biased by the important role of the ibvp in numerical relativity , which treats einstein s equations as a set of partial differential equations ( pdes ) governing the metric in some preferred coordinate system . on the other hand , from a geometrical perspective ,",
    "one of the most fundamental and beautiful results of general relativity is that the properties of the local cauchy problem can be summed up in geometric terms independent of any coordinates or explicit pdes .",
    "this geometric formulation only came about after the cauchy problem was well understood from the pde point - of - view .",
    "the importance of the geometric approach to the numerical relativist is that it supplies a common starting point for discussing and comparing different formulations of einstein s equations .",
    "presently , the pde aspects of metric formulations of the ibvp are only understood in the harmonic formulation . in order to transfer this insight into other formulations",
    "a geometric framework can serve as an important guide .",
    "for that reason , i will shift often between the pde and geometric approach .",
    "when the emphasis is on the geometric side i will use abstract indices , e.g. @xmath11 to denote a vector field , and on the pde side i will use coordinate indices , e.g. @xmath12 , to denote components with respect to spacetime coordinates @xmath13 .",
    "the standard mathematical approach to the ibvp is to first establish the well - posedness of the underlying cauchy problem , and next the local half - space problem .",
    "if these individual problems are well - posed ( in a sense to be qualified later ) then the problems with more general boundaries will also be well - posed .",
    "thus i start my review in sec .",
    "[ sec : cauchy ] by first providing some brief background material for the cauchy problem .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ sec : compl ] , i point out the complications in going from the cauchy problem to the ibvp .",
    "the ibvp for einstein s equations is not well understood due to problems arising from the constraint equations .",
    "the motivation for this work stems from the need for an improved understanding and implementation of boundary conditions in the computational codes being used to simulate binary black holes .",
    "the ability to compute the details of the gravitational radiation produced by compact astrophysical sources , such as coalescing black holes , is of major importance to the success of gravitational wave astronomy .",
    "if the simulation of such systems is based upon a well - posed cauchy problem but not a well - posed ibvp then the results can not be trusted in the domain of dependence of the outer boundary . in sec",
    "s  [ sec : bare ] ,  [ sec : initial ] and  [ sec : hyperb ] , i present the underlying mathematical theory .",
    "early computational work in general relativity focused on the cauchy problem and the ibvp only received considerable attention after its importance to stable and accurate simulations was recognized .",
    "i discuss some history of the work on the ibvp in sec .",
    "[ sec : history ] , for the purpose of pointing out some of the partial successes and ideas which may be of future use .",
    "in addition to the mathematical issue of an appropriate boundary condition , the description of a binary black hole as an isolated system raises the physical issue of the appropriate outer boundary data . in the absence of an exterior solution , which could provide this data by matching ,",
    "the standard practice is to set this data to zero .",
    "this raises the question , discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : absorbc ] , of how to formulate a non - reflecting outer boundary condition in order to avoid spurious incoming radiation .",
    "sec s  [ sec : fn ] and  [ sec : harm ] describe the two strongly well - posed formulations of the ibvp , which are known at the present time . neither is based upon a @xmath14 formulation and they both handle the constraints in different ways",

    "[ sec : constr ] , of constraint enforcement in the @xmath14 formulations .",
    "the resolution of issues regarding geometric uniqueness , discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : geom ] , would shed light on the universal features of the ibvp that would perhaps guide the way to a successful @xmath14 treatment .",
    "there is also the computational problem of turning a well - posed ibvp into a stable and accurate evolution code .",
    "i will not go into the details of the large range of techniques which are necessary for the successful implementation of a numerical relativity code .",
    "since initiating this review , i have learned of a separate review in progress  @xcite which covers such numerical techniques in great detail .",
    "building a numerical relativity code is a complex undertaking .",
    "as observed by post and votta  @xcite in a study of large scale computational projects , `` the peer review process in computational science generally does nt provide as effective a filter as it does for experiment or theory .",

    "they emphasize that `` new methods of verifying and validating complex codes are mandatory if computational science is to fulfill its promise for science and society '' .",
    "these observations are especially pertinent for numerical relativity where validation by agreement with experiment is not yet possible . in that spirit",

    "here i summarize those aspects of the cauchy problem which are fundamental to the ibvp . for more detail , see  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to newtonian theory , which describes gravity in terms of an elliptic poisson equation that propagates the gravitational field instantaneously , the retarded interactions implicit in general relativity give rise to new features such as gravitational waves .",
    "wave propagation results from the mathematical property that einstein s equations can be reduced to a hyperbolic system of pdes .",
    "however , the coordinate freedom in einstein s theory admits gauge waves which propagate with arbitrarily high speeds , including speeds faster than light .",
    "einstein s equations are not a priori a hyperbolic system in which propagation speeds must be bounded and for which an initial value problem can be posed .",
    "this crucial step in going from einstein s equations to a hyperbolic system has been highlighted by friedrich as the process of hyperbolic reduction  @xcite .",
    "the first and most famous example of hyperbolic reduction was through the introduction of harmonic coordinates , which led to the classic result that the cauchy problem for the harmonic formulation of einstein s equations is well - posed  @xcite . here",
    "i summarize the hyperbolic reduction of einstein s equations in in terms of generalized harmonic coordinates @xmath15 , which are functionally independent solutions of the curved space scalar wave equation @xmath16 where @xmath17 are gauge source functions  @xcite . in terms of the connection @xmath18 , these harmonic conditions are @xmath19 where @xmath20    the hyperbolic reduction of the einstein tensor results from setting @xmath21 where @xmath22 is treated formally as a vector field in constructing the `` covariant '' derivatives @xmath23 .",
    "( in generalized harmonic formulations based upon a background connection , @xmath22 is a legitimate vector field .",

    "the well - posedness of the cauchy problem for the system ( [ eq : creduced ] ) then follows from known results for systems of quasilinear wave equations .",
    "( it is important to bear in mind that such results are local in time since there is no general theory for the global existence of solutions to nonlinear equations . )    in turn , the well - posedness of the cauchy problem for the harmonic einstein equations also follows provided that the harmonic conditions @xmath27 are preserved under the evolution . the proof of constraint preservation results from applying the contracted bianchi identity @xmath28 to ( [ eq : creduced ] ) .",
    "this leads to a homogeneous wave equation for @xmath29 , @xmath30 if the initial data enforce @xmath31 and @xmath32 then the unique solution of ( [ eq : bianchi ] ) is @xmath33 .",
    "it is easy to satisfy ( [ eq : c0 ] ) by algebraically determining the initial values of @xmath34 in terms of the initial values of @xmath35 and their spatial derivatives . in order to see how to satisfy ( [ eq : ct0 ] ) note that the reduced equations ( [ eq : reduced ] ) imply @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the unit timelike normal to the cauchy hyperurfaces . thus if @xmath38 i.e. if the hamiltonian and momentum constraints are satisfied by the initial data , and if the reduced equations ( [ eq : creduced ] ) are satisfied then it follows that @xmath39|_{{\\cal s}_0 } = 0 .",
    "\\label{eq : ndc}\\ ] ] it is easy to check that ( [ eq : ndc ] ) implies that @xmath40 provided @xmath41 .    as a result , the traditional hamiltonian and momentum constraints on the initial data , along with the reduced evolution equations ( [ eq : creduced ] ) ) ,",
    "imply that the initial conditions ( [ eq : c0 ] ) and ( [ eq : ct0 ] ) required for preserving the harmonic conditions are satisfied .",
    "conversely , if the hamiltonian and momentum constraints are satisfied initially , then ( [ eq : gn ] ) ensures that they will be preserved under harmonic evolution .",
    "thus the conditions @xmath42 can be considered as the constraints of the generalized harmonic formulation .",
    "the formalism also allows constraint adjustments by which ( [ eq : creduced ] ) is modified by @xmath43 where the coefficients @xmath44 have the dependence @xmath45 .",
    "such constraint adjustments have proved to be important in applying constraint damping  @xcite in the simulation of black holes  @xcite and in suppressing long wavelength instabilities in a shifted gauge wave test  @xcite ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : num ] ) .",
    "however , they do not change the principal part of the reduced equations and have no effect on well - posedness .    historically , the first cauchy codes were based upon the `` 3 + 1 '' or arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) formulation of the einstein equations  @xcite .",
    "the adm formulation introduces a cauchy foliation of space - time by a time coordinate @xmath46 and expresses the 4-dimensional metric as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the induced 3-metric of the @xmath49 foliation , @xmath50 is the lapse and @xmath51 the shift , with the unit normal to the foliation given by @xmath52 .",
    "the field equations are written in first differential form in terms of the extrinsic curvature of the cauchy foliation @xmath53 this can be accomplished in many ways . in one of the earliest schemes proposed for numerical relativity by york  @xcite ,",
    "the requirement that the 6 spatial components of the ricci tensor vanish , i.e @xmath54 , yields a set of evolution equations for the 3-metric and extrinsic curvature , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the connection and @xmath57 is the ricci tensor associated with @xmath48 .",
    "the hamiltonian and momentum constraints take the form @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "codes presently used for the simulation of binary black holes apply the constraints to the initial cauchy data but do not enforce them during the evolution .",
    "the choice of evolution equations may be modified by mixing in combinations of the constraint equations .",
    "in addition , the evolution equations must be supplemented by equations governing the lapse and shift .",
    "there is a lot of freedom in how all this can be done .",
    "the choices affect whether the cauchy problem is well - posed .",
    "the difficulties underlying the ibvp have recently been discussed in  @xcite .",
    "there are several chief complications which do not arise in the cauchy problem .    1 .",
    "the first complication stems from a well - known property of the flat - space scalar wave boundary problem @xmath61 the light rays are the characteristics of the equation .",
    "there are two characteristics associated with each direction , e.g. the characteristics in the @xmath62 direction .",
    "both of these characteristics cross the initial hypersurface @xmath63 but only one crosses the boundary at @xmath64 . as a result , although the initial cauchy data consist of the two pieces of information @xmath65 and @xmath66 , only half as much boundary data can be freely prescribed at @xmath64 , e.g the dirichlet data @xmath67 , or the neumann data @xmath68 or the sommerfeld data @xmath69 .",
    "sommerfeld data is based upon the derivative of @xmath70 in the characteristic direction determined by the outward normal to the boundary .",
    "( in the first differential order formalism @xmath71 is an _ ingoing variable _ at the boundary . ) the choices @xmath72 do not lead to the same solution . in order to obtain a given physical solution",
    ", this implies that the boundary data can not be prescribed before the boundary condition is specified , i.e. the boundary data for the solution depends upon the boundary condition , unlike the situation for the cauchy problem .",
    "the analogue in the gravitational case is the inability to prescribe both the metric and its normal derivative on a timelike boundary , which implies the inability to freely prescribe both the intrinsic 3-metric of the boundary and its extrinsic curvature .",
    "this leads to a further complication regarding constraint enforcement at the boundary , i.e. the hamiltonian and momentum constraints ( [ eq : hamc ] ) and ( [ eq : momc ] ) can not be enforced directly because they couple the metric and its normal derivative .",
    "2 .   for computational purposes ,",
    "a sommerfeld boundary condition is preferable because it allows numerical noise to propagate across the boundary .",
    "thus discretization error can leave the numerical grid , whereas dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions would reflect the error and trap it in the grid .",
    "the sommerfeld condition on a metric component supplies the value of the derivative @xmath73 in an outgoing null direction @xmath74 .",
    "however , the boundary does not pick out a unique outgoing null direction at a given point but , instead , essentially a half cone of null directions .",
    "this complicates the geometric formulation of a sommerfeld boundary condition .",
    "in addition , constraint preservation does not allow free specification of sommerfeld data for all components of the metric , as will be seen later in formulating the sommerfeld conditions ( [ eq : hk ] ) - ( [ eq : hl ] ) .",
    "the correct boundary data for the gravitational field is generally not known except in special cases , e.g. when simulating an exact solution .",
    "this differs from electromagnetic theory where , say , homogeneous dirichlet or neumann data for the various components of the electromagnetic field correctly describe the data for reflection from a mirror .",
    "the tacit assumption in the simulation of an isolated system is that homogeneous sommerfeld data gives rise to minimal back reflection of gravitational waves from the outer boundary .",
    "but this is an approximation which only becomes exact in the limit of an infinite sized boundary .",
    "another major complication arises from the gauge freedom . in the evolution of the cauchy data it is necessary to introduce a foliation of the spacetime by cauchy hypersurfaces @xmath75 , with unit timelike normal @xmath76 .",
    "the evolution of the spacetime metric @xmath77 is carried out along the flow of an evolution vector field @xmath78 which is related to the normal by the lapse @xmath50 and shift @xmath79 by @xmath80 the choice of foliation is part of the gauge freedom in the resulting solution but does not enter into the specification of the initial data . in the current treatments of the ibvp ,",
    "the foliation is coupled with the formulation of the boundary condition . as a result",
    ", some gauge information enters into the boundary condition and boundary data .",
    "the partial derivative @xmath81 entering into the construction of the boundary condition for the metric has by itself no intrinsic geometric interpretation , unless , say , a background connection or a preferred vector field is introduced .",
    "6 .   in general , the boundary moves with respect to the initial cauchy hypersurface in the sense that the spacelike unit outer normal @xmath82 to @xmath5 is not orthogonal to the timelike unit normal @xmath76 to @xmath6 .",
    "the initial velocity of the boundary is characterized by the hyperbolic angle @xmath83 , where @xmath84 specification of @xmath83 on the edge @xmath7 must be included in the data .",
    "+ the coordinate specification of the location of the boundary is pure gauge since it does not determine its location geometrically in the sense that a curve is determined geometrically by its its acceleration , given its initial position and velocity .",
    "given @xmath7 and @xmath83 , the future location of the boundary should be determined in a geometrically unique way . in the friedrich - nagy system , the motion of the boundary is determined by specifying its mean extrinsic curvature . but",
    "this is tantamount to a piece of neumann data .",
    "can this be accomplished via a non - reflecting boundary condition of the sommerfeld type ? 7 .   in a reduction",
    "to first differential order form by introducing a momentum @xmath85 , according to the example @xmath86 there is a further difficulty if @xmath87 at the boundary .",
    "the sign of @xmath83 determines whether @xmath88 points outward or inward to @xmath5 , i.e whether @xmath70 is an ingoing or outgoing variable .",
    "thus the sign of @xmath83 determines whether such an advection equation requires a boundary condition .",
    "this forces a dirichlet condition on the normal component of the shift in some 3 + 1 formulations .",
    "there are also compatibility conditions between the initial data and the boundary data at the edge @xmath7 .",
    "for the example of the scalar wave problem ( [ eq : swe1 ] ) with a dirichlet boundary condition at @xmath64 , the boundary data must satisfy @xmath89 where the right hand side is determined by the initial data .",
    "an infinite sequence of such conditions follow from taking time derivatives of the wave equation",
    ". they must be satisfied if the solution is required to be @xmath90 .",
    "in simple problems , this sequence of compatibility conditions can be satisfied by choosing initial data and boundary data with support that vanishes in a neighborhood of the edge @xmath7 .",
    "but in problems with elliptical constraints , such as occur in general relativity , this simple approach is not possible . in numerical relativity , these compatibility conditions are usually ignored , with the consequence that some transient _ junk _ radiation emanating from the edge is generated . in principle , this could be avoided by smoothly _",
    "gluing _ the initial data to an exterior region with schwarzschild  @xcite or kerr  @xcite data .",
    "this gluing construction would avoid mathematical difficulties but it is an implicit construction and in practice no numerical algorithm for carrying it out has been proposed . in the simulation of binary black holes ,",
    "this edge effect combines with another source of junk radiation which is hidden in the choice of initial data .",
    "the tacit assumption is that the spurious radiation from these sources is quickly flushed out of the simulation , with no significant effect after a few crossing times .",
    "since this issue is difficult to treat or quantify in a useful way , i adopt the expedient assumption that all compatibility conditions for a @xmath90 solution have been met .    in order to resolve most of the above complications it appears that a foliation @xmath91 of the boundary @xmath5 must be specified as part of the boundary data .",
    "such a foliation is a common ingredient of all successful treatments to date .",
    "the foliation supplies the gauge information which determines a unique outgoing null direction for a sommerfeld condition . in sec .",
    "[ sec : bare ] , i specify @xmath91 in terms of the choice of an evolution vector field on the boundary .",
    "most of the above complications stem from the fact the domain of dependence determined by the boundary alone is empty .",
    "an initial value problem for a hyperbolic system can be be consistently posed in the absence of a boundary .",
    "but the opposite is not true for an ibvp . without an underlying cauchy problem",
    ", an ibvp does not make sense . in an ibvp",
    ", boundary data can not determine a unique solution independently of the initial cauchy data and there is no domain in which the solution is independent of the initial data .",
    "thus a well - posed ibvp problem must be based upon a well - posed cauchy problem .",
    "in constructing an evolution code for the gravitational field , the first step is define a spatial grid and a time update scheme .",
    "this sets up the underlying structure necessary to store the values of the various fields .",
    "the analogous object at the continuum level corresponds to the bare manifold on which the gravitational field is later painted .",
    "this is the approach i will adopt here .",
    "it provides a useful way to order the introduction of the basic geometric quantities which enter the ibvp .    setting up the spatial grid corresponds to the analytic specification of spatial coordinates @xmath92 on @xmath0 .",
    "the time update algorithm corresponds to the introduction of an evolution field @xmath78 in @xmath9 which is tangent to the boundary @xmath5 .",
    "( in more complicated update schemes , which i wo nt consider , the boundary might move through the grid . )",
    "the evolution field must have the property that under its flow @xmath0 is mapped into a foliation @xmath75 of @xmath9 , and its edge @xmath7 is mapped into a foliation @xmath91 of @xmath5 .",
    "if a time coordinate is initiated at @xmath63 on @xmath0 then the flow of @xmath78 induces _ adapted coordinates _",
    "@xmath93 on @xmath9 by requiring @xmath94 @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the lie derivative with respect to @xmath78 .",
    "note that @xmath78 and the adapted coordinates @xmath97 are explicitly constructed fields on @xmath9 with no metric properties .",
    "they uniquely fix the gauge freedom on @xmath9 in precisely the same way that the numerical grid and update scheme provide a unique evolution algorithm",
    ". if @xmath98 are the coordinates on the edge @xmath7 , then the corresponding adapted coordinates on the boundary are @xmath99 , where @xmath100",
    ". it will be convenient throughout this review to let the manifold with boundary be described by adapted coordinates @xmath101    under a diffeomorphism @xmath102 of @xmath9 which maps @xmath5 into itself , @xmath103 where @xmath104 can be chosen to be any other possible evolution field . in particular , if @xmath105 in @xmath9 and @xmath106 on @xmath0 then the diffeomorphism must be the identity .",
    "thus , given a coordinate gauge on @xmath0 , the choice of @xmath78 determines the remaining diffeomorphism freedom .",
    "this allows a description of the evolution in a specific choice of adapted coordinates without losing sight of the gauge freedom .",
    "note that any one - form normal to the boundary is proportional to @xmath107 .",
    "however , at the bare manifold level the unit normal can not be specified since that involves metric information .",
    "the projection tensor @xmath108 has the properties @xmath109 i.e. it projects a vector field into the tangent space of @xmath75 , and @xmath110 i.e. it projects a 1-form into the space orthogonal to @xmath111 .",

    "knowledge of the sommerfeld boundary data allows the wave to enter and leave the boundaries , but the numerical error , although small and convergent , excites an exponential mode of the analytic problem .",
    "however , because this instability violates the harmonic constraints it was possible to suppress it by a harmonic constraint adjustment of the form ( [ eq : creduced2 ] )  @xcite .",
    "this example emphasizes the importance of understanding instabilities in the analytic problem in order to control them in a numerical simulation .",
    "other wave solutions which have been used for numerical tests are the teukolsky waves  @xcite , which are linearized spherical waves appropriate for testing a spherical boundary , and the nonlinear brill waves  @xcite , which are useful for testing wave propagation during collapse to a black hole .",
    "teukolsky wave tests of the harmonic sommerfeld conditions confirm that the constraint violation error due to homogeneous outer boundary data drops to numerical truncation error as the wave propagates off the grid  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , when constraint damping is applied to the interior of the grid , the error drops to machine round - off . for brill wave tests with the same code , homogeneous sommerfeld conditions",
    "lead to considerable back reflection off the boundary , as expected from the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : absorbc ] . in  @xcite",
    ", teukolsky waves were also used to test an implementation of the improved higher order harmonic boundary conditions proposed by buchman and sarbach  @xcite .",
    "rinne , lindblom and scheel  @xcite have developed a numerical test for comparing back reflection of waves from a spherical boundary .",
    "first , using perturbative techniques , they construct a reference solution for a linearized gravitational wave propagating on an exterior schwarzschild background .",
    "then the full numerical code is run with a finite spherical outer boundary .",
    "the error with respect to the reference solution is used to compare different choices of boundary conditions .",
    "using the first order harmonic code described in  @xcite , they used this test to compare several boundary conditions .",
    "the comparisons of homogeneous sommerfeld boundary conditions were in accord with the theoretical expectations discussed in sec s  [ sec : absorbc ] and  [ sec : harm ] .",
    "the higher order sommerfeld conditions and the @xmath514 freezing condition both produced less back refection than the first order conditions ( [ eq : modasymkk ] ) -([eq : modasymqq ] ) .",
    "the test was also used to reveal the spurious effects arising from a sponge boundary condition and also from the combination of numerical dissipation and spatial compactification used by pretorius  @xcite . in an independent",
    "follow up of this test  @xcite , the advantages of higher order sommerfeld conditions were confirmed .",
    "although @xmath14 codes have been predominant in binary black hole simulations , boundary tests have not been very extensive as compared to harmonic codes .",
    "this is especially pertinent for the bssn system .",
    "boundary tests based on a gravitational wave perturbation of the schwarzschild exterior have been carried out for the kst system  @xcite .",
    "the results revealed instabilities although they showed how improvements to the boundary conditions could reduce constraint violation .",
    "the robust stability and brill wave tests have been applied to boundary conditions for a symmetric hyperbolic version of the einstein - christoffel system  @xcite .",
    "although the cauchy problem for this system is well - posed , both tests revealed instabilities due to the boundary algorithm . again the tests were useful guides for understanding the problems with the boundary treatment .",
    "c. bona and c. bona - casas  @xcite have made the first application of the gowdy wave boundary test .",
    "they show how it can be applied to a symmetric hyperbolic version of the first order z4 formalism . here , as in many other studies , the cauchy problem is well - posed but the strong well - posedness of the ibvp depends on the boundary condition .",
    "improper boundary conditions can lead to instability and/or constraint violation .",
    "they first demonstrate that the test is effective at investigating methods for preserving the energy constraint for the z4 system in a strong field environment .",
    "in a subsequent work  @xcite , they apply both the gowdy wave and robust stability boundary tests in an expanded study of constraint violation in the z4 framework .",
    "the robust stability case is applied both with opening up one axis of the 3-torus and with a fully cubic boundary .",
    "this allows testing sbp algorithms at the corners and edges .",
    "the results show numerical stability of the proposed boundary algorithms in the linearized regime .",
    "the gowdy wave test extends this study to constraint preservation in the nonlinear regime .",
    "the results provide further evidence of numerical stability and show that constraint violation can be kept at the level of discretization error .",
    "the ibvp has analytical , computational , geometrical and physical aspects .",
    "the analytic goal is a strongly well - posed ibvp , which is the prime necessity for the computational goal of an accurate evolution algorithm .",
    "it is also the raison detre for the geometric goal of a gauge invariant formulation of the boundary data .",
    "the prime physical goal , at present , is the accurate simulation of binary black holes .",
    "the binary black hole problem has taken a course of its own , which has been remarkably successful in view of the gaps in our current understanding of the other aspects of the ibvp .      * * question 1 .",
    "* is there a strongly well - posed ibvp based upon a @xmath14 formulation ? + some insight into this question would be provided by the answer to * * question 2 .",

    "+ in the friedrich - nagy treatment , there are three pieces of boundary data which are not pure gauge : the trace @xmath311 of the extrinsic boundary curvature , which determines the location of the boundary , and the weyl curvature components encoding the two radiation degrees of freedom . in the harmonic system , the sommerfeld data which encode the radiation consist of the shear , or the weyl curvature components for a higher order condition .",
