    "under high steady stresses fiber composites may undergo time dependent deformation resulting in failure called creep rupture which limits their lifetime , and hence , has a high impact on the applicability of these materials in construction elements . both natural fiber composites like wood @xcite and various types of fiber reinforced composites @xcite show creep rupture phenomena , which have attracted continuous theoretical and experimental interest over the past years .",
    "the underlying microscopic failure mechanism of creep rupture is very complex depending on several characteristics of the specific types of materials , and is far from being well understood .",
    "theoretical studies encounter various challenges : on the one hand , applications of fiber composites require the development of analytical and numerical models which are able to predict the damage histories of loaded composites in terms of the specific parameters of constituents . on the other hand , creep rupture , similarly to other rupture phenomena , presents a very interesting problem for statistical physics , it is still an open problem to embed creep rupture into the general framework of statistical physics and to understand the analogy between rupture phenomena and phase transitions .",
    "creep failure tests are usually performed under uniaxial tensile loading when the specimen is subjected either to a constant load @xmath1 or to an increasing load ( ramp - loading ) and the time evolution of the damage process is monitored by recording the strain @xmath2 of the specimen and the acoustic signals emitted by microscopic failure events @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we study the creep rupture of fiber composites in the framework of fiber bundle models @xcite focusing on general characteristics of creep rupture .",
    "our main goal is to reveal the universal aspects of a creeping system which do not depend on specific material properties .",
    "we will derive scaling laws which emerge when approaching the failure stress both from below and above , furthermore , the finite size scaling of the time to failure is studied . beyond",
    "the theoretical understanding , exploring universal features of creep helps to evaluate experimental data and can serve as a guide to extract the relevant information invariant under the variation of specific material properties .",
    "we consider only the case of global load sharing ( gls ) for the redistribution of load following fiber failure @xcite . for several types of materials gls",
    "provides an adequate approach , and it has the advantage that many of the important gls results can be obtained in closed analytic forms . during creep at the critical point and above it ,",
    "stress localization occurs which can be captured by localized load sharing in fiber bundle models @xcite but this is beyond the scope of our investigations .",
    "the present study is focused on analytic modeling in the framework of gls .",
    "we also develop efficient simulation techniques for testing the analytic results , furthermore , to study finite size system . since similar studies with local load sharing",
    "require large scale computer simulations and a large amount of data processing it will be presented in a forthcoming publication .",
    "in order to work out a theoretical description of creep failure we introduce two novel fiber bundle models improving the classical fiber bundle models @xcite which have proven very successful in the study of fracture of disordered materials @xcite .",
    "the two models differ in the microscopic mechanisms assumed to be responsible for the macroscopic creep behavior : @xmath3 in the first approach the fibers themselves are viscoelastic and they break when their deformation exceeds a stochastically distributed threshold value ( strain controlled breaking ) , @xmath4 in the second model the fibers are linearly elastic until they break stochastically in a stress controlled way , however , after breaking their relaxation is not instantaneous but the sliding of the broken fiber with respect to the matrix material , and the yielding or creeping of the matrix introduces an intrinsic time scale for the relaxation .",

    "it can be seen that @xmath9 converges to @xmath13 for @xmath14 , which implies that the asymptotic strain fulfills hook s law .",

    "when a fiber fails its load has to be redistributed to the intact fibers . assuming global load sharing , the time evolution of the system under a steady external load @xmath18 is finally described by the equation @xmath19 where the viscoelastic behavior of fibers is coupled to the failure of fibers in a global load sharing framework @xcite .    for the behavior of the solutions of eq .",

    "<S> analytical and numerical calculations show that above a critical load the deformation of the creeping system monotonically increases in time resulting in global failure at a finite time @xmath0 , while below the critical load the system suffers only partial failure and the deformation tends to a constant value giving rise to an infinite lifetime . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that approaching the critical load from below and above the creeping system is characterized by universal power laws when the fibers have long range interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the lifetime of the composite above the critical point has a universal dependence on the system size .    2 </S>"
