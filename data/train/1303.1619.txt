    "gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) are one of the most powerful events in the universe .",
    "the high energy photons emitted travel from cosmological distance tracing the star formation history in the universe .",
    "more than 5 grbs have been found at @xmath0 indicating that grbs are the most distant objects in the universe .",
    "several papers have shown how grbs evolve with redshift and have investigated the possibility to use these sources to probe the star formation rate at high redshift@xcite .    while it is widely accepted that grbs are produced by the dissipation of energy in highly relativistic winds driven by compact objects ( see , e.g.,@xcite for reviews ) the physics of wind generation and radiation production is not yet understood .",
    "it is not known , for example , whether the wind luminosity is carried , as commonly assumed , by kinetic energy or by poynting flux ( e.g.@xcite ) , whether the radiating particles are accelerated by the dissipation of magnetic flux or by internal shocks dissipating kinetic energy , and whether the emission is dominated by synchrotron or inverse - compton radiation of accelerated electrons , as commonly assumed , or by hadronic energy loss of accelerated protons ( see@xcite , and references therein ) .    before fermi , grbs were detected by instruments sensitive mainly in the 100 to 1000 kev range like batse@xcite and the grbm on bepposax@xcite .",
    "measurements at high energy were limited by the lower sensitivity and/or the smaller field of view of higher energy instruments ( e.g. cgro / egret-@xcite ; agile / grid-@xcite ) . the improved high energy , @xmath1 gev , sensitivity and field of view of the instruments on board the fermi satellite@xcite were expected to improve the quantity and quality of high energy grb data .",
    "several grbs were expected to be detected in the @xmath2 gev range by lat .    however , one of the key results of fermi is that the vast majority of grbs detected by gbm were not detected by lat .",
    "this result implies qualitatively new constraints on grb models . in an earlier study , guetta et al .",
    "( 2011)@xcite have used the non - detection of gev emission from the majority of fermi grbs , to put upper limits on the gev fluence of long grbs .",
    "they find an upper limit on the lat / gbm fluence ratio of less than unity for 60% of grbs . in a later work of beniamini et al ( 2011)@xcite found an average upper limit to the fluence ratio of 0.13 during the prompt phase for the most luminous grbs detected by the gbm but not by lat .",
    "it is important to notice that putting upper limits on the lat / gbm fluence ratio is crucial in order to test the nature of the spectrum at high energies .",
    "this , in turn , will further constrain the emitting mechanism .",
    "i will discuss the results of these works on the lat upper limits and implications in section 3 of this review .",
    "another key result of fermi is that the @xmath2 gev emission detected by lat seems to be systematically delayed with respect to the emission observed with the gbm at hundreds - of - kev energies ( fig .",
    "2 , left of piron et al 2012@xcite ) several physical models have been introduced to explain this delay .",
    "the most accredited are the afterglow model : in this model the delay is interpreted as due to different origins of the low and high energy emissions , the prompt low energy emission coming from the internal shocks while the high energy delayed emission may be associated to the afterglow emission@xcite .",
    "the other model is the lorentz invariance violation : if the high energy photons are emitted during the prompt phase then the delay may be due to lorentz invariance violation@xcite .    in this review",
    "i will discuss the possibility that the delay is due to lorentz invariance violation and show the implications of this scenario .",
    "a key test of lorentz invariance is an energy - dependent dispersion effect , the possible variation of photon speed with energy .",
    "this leads to a variation in photon arrival time with energy , roughly given by @xmath3 which could be as large as seconds to hours for photons in the @xmath4 to @xmath5 range if the distance @xmath6 travelled is cosmological . where @xmath7 is the quantum gravity mass thought to be on the order of @xmath8 . as we can see from this equation",
    "the effect is expected to be extremely small , however for propagation over cosmological distances ( as grbs are ) , the strong suppression by the planck scale can be compensated by the very large propagation times , greatly amplyfing the obsevability of these tiny effects .",
    "several works have already reported limits on the characteristic scale @xmath7 with the desirable `` planck- scale significance '' , using fermi data for several grbs like grbs080916c , grb090510 , grb090902b and grb090926a @xcite . in section 4 of this review",
    "i will summirize these results and will propose a different strategy to put constraint on the @xmath7 which uses the full grb energy distribution , i.e. the spectrum , and its temporal variations@xcite .    in section 5 we will discuss the necessity of a sinergy between the fermi telescope , neutrino telescopes ( like present icecube and future km3net ) and gravitational wave detectors ( like virgo and ligo ) .",
    "the sinergy with these detectors is fundamental as it will allow to put constraints on the hadronic emission models ( icecube ) and to the progenitor models for the short gamma - ray bursts . in section 6",
    "we report our conclusions .",
    "after twenty years of extensive research in the gamma ray burst field there are few basic , unquestionable facts , which are common to all grbs and should be addressed by any theoretical model .",
    "it is firm today that grbs are :    * at cosmological distance , as they are typically observed at redshift @xmath9 * the jet expands relativistically : high lorentz factor @xmath10 is required by observation of high energy photons .",
    "this has solid confirmation by the existence of afterglow emission , which follows the interaction of the relativistic ejecta with the ambient medium . *",
    "the energy released is up to few times the rest mass of sun ( if isotropic ) in a few seconds .",
    "* there are two populations of grbs separated by their duration and hardness : short ( @xmath11 s ) and long ( @xmath12 s ) grbs * the spectrum is not thermal and in the vast majority of bursts , it has a broken power law shape ( the `` band '' function , named after the late david band ) , peaking at sub - mev , with a fairly sharp decline at higher energies ) .    together with these unquestionable facts there are still several fundamental open questions that need to be answered .",
    "one of them is the composition of the jet : are hadrons present in the jet and what is their role in the emission mechanism ?",
    "related to that we do not know yet what are the main radiative processes , and physical explanation to the broad band spectrum observed . the nature of the dissipation mechanism that leads to the emission of @xmath13-rays is still poorly understood . regarding the progenitor models",
    "there are evidence that long grbs are associated to the collapse of massive star and are connected to supernova@xcite while for short grbs indirect evidence suggests that short grbs originate from binary mergers @xcite , but there is no conclusive evidence yet@xcite .",
    "the finall product of both long and short grb progenitors is probably a black hole . in this review",
    "i will show how the results of fermi and the synergy between fermi and neutrino and gravitational wave telescopes can help us in addressing these open questions allowing a deeper understanding of the nature of grbs .",
    "in particular i will concentrate on two lat key results : the paucity of grbs detected by lat and the delay between the gbm and lat emission .",
    "in an earlier study , guetta et al . ( 2011@xcite ) have used the non - detection of gev emission from the majority of fermi grbs , to put upper limits on the gev fluence of long grbs .",
    "they find an upper limit on the lat / gbm fluence ratio of less than unity for 60% of grbs .",
    "this is consistent but not better than the egret - derived limits@xcite . in beniamini",
    "et al 2011@xcite , the authors use a more subtle approach to further constrain these limits . as the lat detected grbs are also among the brightest grbs in the gbm band , they examine the brightest group of gbm bursts with no lat detection . they have analyzed the group of 18 most luminous gbm bursts , as these are expected to have the highest ( undetected ) gev component . for these bursts ,",
    "they obtain upper limits on the gev fluence .",
    "1 depicts comparisons of the lat / gbm fluence ratios of lat bursts with the upper limits on the lat / gbm fluence ratio of lat non - detected bursts for t = t90 sec .",
    "the average lat / gbm fluence ratio for lat detected bursts is 0.09 for t90 .",
    "these limits are somewhat lower than the corresponding upper limit on this ratio derived for all 18 gbm bursts that is on average 0.13 during the prompt phase ( t90 ) .",
    "1 shows that these limits are almost uniform for all gbm bursts and do not seem to depend on the gbm fluence of the bursts .",
    "this means that the upper limits derived here are mainly representative of the lat detection limit and do not show any evidence for actual gev signals in the gbm sample .",
    "this lat / gbm fluence ratio strongly constrains various emission models and rule out any model in which there is a strong gev component in the prompt mission .",
    "in particular they limit strongly ssc models for the prompt emission as those will suggest a second ssc component at the gev@xcite .",
    "they pose a strong limit on the conditions within the emitting regions showing no ic gev peak . for the majority of the gbm and",
    "the lat bursts the gev fluence is compatible with the band extrapolation of the mev emission .",
    "however , out of the lat bursts , in three cases the band extrapolation of the mev emission is higher than the observed fluence . similarly the band extrapolation is higher than the lat upper limits in 5 out of the 18 gbm bursts .",
    "both results are consistent and suggest that in some bursts we observe a decline in the spectral high energy slope between the mev and the gev .",
    "this may be the first indication for the long sought after pair opacity break in the high energy spectrum . if so it can enable us to estimate corresponding values of the bulk lorentz factors which are around a few hundred .",
    "another explanation may be that the electron energy distribution does not follow a power law over a wide energy range@xcite .",
    "the candidate quantum - gravity effects that can be most effectively studied using grbs are those amounting to a violation@xcite or deformation of lorentz invariance , induced by the planck scale@xcite ( @xmath14 gev ) .",
    "in particular it has been observed@xcite that quantum properties of spacetime could produce an effective energy - dependent dispersion effect , effectively introducing a small dependence on energy of the speed of photons . for propagation over cosmological distances , the strong suppression by the planck scale can be compensated by the very large propagation times , greatly amplyfing the obsevability of these tiny effects . because of the smallness of the effects at stake , it is important to find the best indicators of the conjectured dispersion effect , also taking into account that we have no control ( and only a limited understanding ) of the emitter of the grb signals we are interested in timing .",
    "some ways to do this , based on characteristic features in the grbs lightcurves at high energy , have already been proposed@xcite .",
    "we here observe that energy - dependent dispersion can be also revealed looking at the grb spectral variability , and we argue that this indicator could play a crucial role in building a case for ( or against ) in - vacuo quantum - gravity - induced dispersion , as the data set on grbs observed at high energies keeps growing .",
    "several works have already reported limits on the characteristic scale @xmath7 with the desirable  planck - scale significance \" , using fermi data for several grbs like grbs080916c , grb090510 , grb090902b and grb090926a@xcite .",
    "most of these limits are obtained considering a single high energy photon exept for the case grb090510 where the fermi collaboration@xcite establishes an interesting bound @xmath7 using the discan method , _",
    "i.e. _ searching for time delays within the lat data , using the energy range 35 mev-31 gev and in the burst interval where there is the most intense emission ( 0.5 - 1.45 s ) .",
    "they find @xmath15 ms gev@xmath16 implying @xmath17 .      [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "dispersion effects produce in the observed spectra three main features:(1 ) a variation of the observed photon index @xmath31 ; ( 2 ) a strong high energy cut off with energy changing with the time as the grb develops ; ( 3 ) the spectrum becomes more complex at grb observed times comparable with the time delay of the high energy photons , with a broad peak developing just before the cut - off .",
    "this peak is due to high energy photons emitted at earlier times , when the burts was brighter , but detected at times when the burst faded away .",
    "if the high energy photons are delayed with respect to the low energy photons ( as in the case of fig.2 ) the spectral photon index becomes flatter as the grb develops , and the cut - off moves from low to high energies .",
    "both effects are due to the fact that high energy photons are systematically shifted at later time .",

    "2013 approximated the grb spectra with the following model : @xmath37 this model is reasonably good approximation for most spectra in fig .",
    "2 . as an example , fig . 3 shows @xmath38 as a function of the redshift for gaussian bursts with @xmath32 sec ( observed frame ) , @xmath39 gev and for @xmath40 gev .",
    "this analysis shows that @xmath38 increases with z quite rapidly and saturates at redshift z=2 - 3 implying that the qg effect may be appreciated if lat will be able to detect several grbs in the @xmath41 redshift range .",
    "fiore et al 2013 have applied the method presented above to four bright lat grb with a measured redshift ( grb080916c , grb090510 , grb090902b and grb090926a ) .",
    "these all have well defined peaks lasting up to a few seconds , which allow them to study spectral variations on seconds ( or fraction of seconds ) timescales .",
    "spectral variations are detected for grb090902b ( a spectral hardening with time ) .",
    "spectral variations are also possible in grb090510 ( a spectral softening with time ) but not statistically significant .",
    "previous limits on @xmath25 were obtained using the arrival time of single high energy photons . in this case",
    "limits are computed by comparing the arrival time of the high energy photon with that of the the burst onset or that of the grb peak , because of course it is not possible to observationally assess the simultaneity of the high energy photon with some of the low energy photons emitted at the same time .",
    "the computed time delay can be much higher that the real one , also because it is not easy to uniquely associate one high energy photon to the grb prompt event or to its afterglow , thus decreasing the magnitude of the limits to e@xmath42 .",
    "conversely , fiore et al .",
    "2013 use the full spectrum ( typically 100 gamma - ray photons ) , constraining its temporal spectral variations on a _",
    "few second _ timescale , thus avoiding long time delays leading to a potential better sensitivity to the e@xmath42 constraints .",
    "the detection of high energy photons from fermi is not enough to constrain hadronic emission models .",
    "the detection of photons ( that can be absorbed at the source or on the way from the source to us ) or high energy protons ( who lose information on the originating source on their way from the source to us ) can not give us enough information on the content of hadrons in the jet and what is their role in the emission mechanism .",
    "only the detection of neutrinos that , unlike high energy photons and protons , can travel cosmological distances without being absorbed or deflected can provide information on astrophysical sources that can not be obtained with high energy photons and charged particles . if hadrons are responsible of the @xmath2gev emission detected in several grbs , then this emission is expected to be correlated to the neutrino flux which depends on the energy fraction of protons in the grb jet . the icecube upper limits and",
    "the fermi data can be used to constrain the hadronic emission models .",
    "icecube , completed in december 2010 , is the first kilometer - scale neutrino detector .",
    "it consists of more than 5000 optical sensors installed at depths from 1,450 m to 2,450 m near the geographic south pole , over an area of 1 km@xmath43 .",
    "icecube analyses include a model - independent search for grb neutrinos@xcite , and for other diffuse and point sources .",
    "recent efforts to detect higher energy neutrinos from sources outside our solar system yield important constraints on point - sources and diffuse fluxes of possible sources .",
    "icecube and fermi overlap in time , therefore the synergy between telescopes is mandatory to constrain the emission mechanism models in grbs    the gbm has detected several short grbs .",
    "double neutron star or black hole / neutron star mergers are believed to give rise to short grbs .",
    "merging binary systems consisting of two collapsed objects are among the most promising sources of high frequency gravitational wave , signals for ground based interferometers short gamma - ray bursts might thus provide a powerful way to infer the merger rate of two - collapsed object binaries@xcite .",
    "the synergy between gbm and future gravitational waves detectors like advanced ligo ( aligo ) and advanced virgo will be fundamental to constrain the short grb progenitor model .",
    "aligo will either detect gravitational waves in coincidence with gbm detections of short grbs , or neutron star - black mergers may be ruled out as the progenitors of these events .",
    "gev emission from grbs is as of yet relatively unexplored observationally .",
    "up to september 2012 , only @xmath2 35 bursts were detected by lat in the gev range and upper limits were put on the gbm grbs not detected by lat@xcite .",
    "these limits have allowed us to give some constraints on several emitting mechanisms .",
    "for example , models where the prompt @xmath44 mev emission is produced by inverse - compton scattering of optical synchrotron photons can be ruled out .",
    "the hadronic emission models proposed to explain the @xmath2 gev emission detected by lat can be constrained using the upper limits on the neutrino flux from grbs recently reported by the icecube collaboration@xcite .",
    "therefore a synergy between fermi and icecube is mandatory and only a multiwavelength analysis will allow us to further constrain the emission mechanism models .    the suppression of the @xmath45 mev flux , compared to that expected from an extrapolation of the @xmath21mev power - law spectrum , suggests that either the electron energy distribution does not follow a power - law over a wide energy range , or that the high energy photons are absorbed , probably by pair production . requiring an optical depth of @xmath46 at 100 mev sets an upper limit to the expansion lorentz factor @xmath471/6 $ ] ( e.g. eq .",

    "2013 , presented a method to obtain limits ( or detections ) to energy - dependent dispersion effects in fermi lat grbs which uses the full grb energy distribution , i.e. the spectrum , and its temporal variations .",
    "this method provides statistically sounds confidence intervals ( or limits ) for the main parameters governing the energy - dependent dispersion . in order to test this method",
    "the ideal would be to have a bigger sample of lat grbs with enough counts in @xmath48 .    in conclusion fermi",
