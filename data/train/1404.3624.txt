    "the goods - n field was observed with the vla in the a configuration , for a total of 39 hours including calibration and move time , between august 9 and september 11 , 2011 .",
    "eight different scheduling blocks were observed , each of 5 hours , except for one which was 4 hours long .",
    "roughly 33 hours of this time were spent on - source .",
    "the observations covered the bands from 10001512 and 15202032 mhz using 1 mhz channels .",
    "a phase , bandpass , and instrumental polarization calibrator , j1313 + 6735 , was observed every twenty minutes .",
    "3c286 was observed to calibrate the flux density scale .    for each scheduling block ,",
    "the data were edited and calibrated in aips .",
    "the worst parts of the band , in particular between 1520 and 1648 mhz were flagged at the beginning of this process .",
    "the rest of the dataset was edited using the rflag task .",
    "after total intensity calibration , the @xmath30-data weights were calibrated using the aips task , reway .",
    "the total intensity data were imaged in casa using the clean task . in particular , the wide - field , nterms=2 parameters were used .",
    "for these parameters , the multi - scale - multi - frequency - synthesis algorithm is used @xcite .",
    "this imaging algorithm solves for the total intensity and spectral index image across the full bandwidth , i.e. , in this case 1 - 2 ghz .",
    "the final image was corrected for the primary beam attenuation , which was calculated and corrected using the casa task widebandpbcor .",
    "the final , full resolution image is @xmath31 pixels of @xmath32 with a clean beam of @xmath33 at pa = @xmath34 and has a central rms noise of 2.2 @xmath7jy ( corresponding to an sfr of 167 @xmath10 at @xmath35 , see section  [ sec_sfr ] ) . for this work , the cleaned image is further convolved with a gaussian to have a circular beam of @xmath5 .",
    "this way , both cleaned bright point sources and uncleaned faint point sources would have comparable sizes in the image .",
    "we have compared our astrometry with the previous deep vla imaging of @xcite .",
    "there is a @xmath36 offset along the r.a .",
    "this offset is much smaller than our beam size and our pixel size , and thus has negligible impact on our analyses .",
    "we directly adopt the @xmath0 lbg samples used in ho10 .",
    "the ho10 @xmath21-dropout samples were selected from the goods v2.0 acs source catalog based on the sextractor @xcite auto - aperture magnitudes with the following criteria : @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 the above criteria are adopted from @xcite and @xcite , and are well established in the literature . in addition , ho10 also excluded compact objects whose sextractor stellarity indices are greater than 0.8 and @xmath41 to prevent stellar contamination .",
    "a total of 1778 @xmath1-dropouts are selected from the goods - n region .",
    "they have redshifts between @xmath42 and @xmath43 , with a mean of @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the goods v2.0 catalog corrects the astrometry offset between the radio and optical frames , so we directly adopt the acs source positions .",
    "we show the distribution of the @xmath44 magnitudes and the absolute uv magnitudes of our lbg samples in fig .",
    "[ fig_mhisto ] .",
    "the mean and median absolute magnitudes are @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath21-dropout luminosity function has a characteristic magnitude of @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "therefore , our lbg samples are @xmath33 magnitudes fainter than @xmath4 and represent the faint end of the @xmath0 lbg population .",
    "measuring fluxes reliably in a radio image requires knowledge about the size of the targets .",
    "ho10 assumed that the size of the lbgs are similar to compact faint objects detected in their radio images . in the present work ,",
    "the high s / n offered by the new vla image allows us to constrain the average size of the @xmath0 lbgs from the stacked image .",
    "we first describe the image stacking and object size",
    ". then we move to more sophisticate , flux - based stacking analyses .",
    "we first measured the 1.5 ghz surface brightness of each lbg at its acs position , in unit of jy beam@xmath27 within one @xmath32 pixel .",
    "the value would also be its total flux in jy if it is a point source and if its radio position matches its acs position .",
    "the distribution is presented fig .",
    "[ fig_fhisto ] ( solid histogram ) .",
    "the majority of the objects ( 1771 out of 1778 ) have surface brightness between @xmath48 @xmath7jy beam@xmath27 and 20 @xmath7jy beam@xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath49 @xmath7jy beam@xmath27 ones can be either intrinsically bright , or happen to fall on sight lines close to foreground radio - bright galaxies .",
    "in the subsequent analyses , we primarily consider sources fainter than 20 @xmath7jy beam@xmath27 .",
    "this threshold corresponds to an sfr of @xmath50 @xmath51 yr@xmath27 at @xmath35 , or an infrared luminosity of @xmath52 ( section  [ sec_sfr ] ) . in other words ,",
    "ulirgs would be included in our analyses , but not the brighter submillimeter galaxies detected in ground - based surveys . increasing",
    "this upper threshold would make our results either more vulnerable to contamination from bright foreground galaxies and radio active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , or being dominated by a small number of brighter lbgs .",
    "decreasing this threshold to close to 10 @xmath7jy would significantly skew the statistics because faint sources may be scattered by the gaussian noise to this flux level .",
    "we further discuss the effect of this threshold in section  [ sec_threshold ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig_fhisto ] , we also show the distribution of surface brightness at random positions within the goods - n region ( dashed curve ) . between @xmath48 and @xmath53 @xmath7jy beam@xmath27 , the histogram for the lbgs appears to shift positively with respect to the histogram for random positions .",
    "this indicates an excess of radio flux from the lbgs .",
    "we next cut the radio image around the optical positions of the lbgs and stacked them . in the stacking , we weighted the images with the inverse - square of the vla primary beam response at the respective positions , which in principle reflects the local noise level .",
    "for our sources , the lowest primary beam response is 0.67 , and @xmath54 of the sources are located in the region where the primary beam response is @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , such a weighting scheme does not introduce a strong bias toward a small number of objects near the center of the primary beam .",
    "we excluded images for lbgs that are brighter than 20 @xmath7jy beam@xmath27 .",
    "for the images included in the stacking , we also excluded any pixels that are brighter than 20 @xmath7jy beam@xmath27 .",
    "we performed both weighted median that is proportional to the weight .",
    "we then integrated the @xmath56 according to the sorted values of the elements until a percentile of 50% . ] and weighted mean in the stacking .",
    "the former provides the typical properties of the majority of the lbgs , while the latter provides the averaged contribution to the total star formation in the lbg population .",
    "the results are presented in fig .  [ fig_stack_images ] . in both the median and mean stacked images",
    ", a significant signal appears at the stacked optical position .",
    "the point - source flux measured at the optical position is @xmath57 @xmath7jy ( median ) and @xmath58 @xmath7jy ( mean ) . in the mean - stacked case ,",
    "if we stack at random positions , there is a 0.087% probability for the stacked flux to be higher than the above 0.237 @xmath7jy .",
    "this probability corresponds to @xmath59 if the distribution is gaussian , and this is consistent with the measured significance level .",
    "furthermore , if we allow for a slightly extended object , the integrated flux measured in a @xmath60 box becomes 0.301 @xmath7jy in the mean - stacked case .",
    "these results show that there is a measurable ( @xmath61@xmath62 ) mean radio flux from the 1771 lbgs .",
    "the key question here is the size and morphology of the lbgs , which would strongly affect how their total fluxes should be measured . in the mean - stacked image ( fig .",
    "[ fig_stack_images ] ( b ) ) , there is a slight hint that the stacked object is north - south elongated .",
    "the same exists in the median - stacked image ( fig .",
    "[ fig_stack_images ] ( a ) ) but is less apparent . if the radio morphology of the lbgs is intrinsically elongated , however , the elongation should not be aligned and the stacked image should not have a preferred direction . therefore , this should be either an effect of noise , or some systematic effects . for the former , given that this elongation is less apparent in the median - stacked image , we think this may be an effect of a small number of noise spikes or nearby radio sources that fall close to the lbgs by chance projection .",
    "we will further quantify the effect of chance projection in the next subsection . a potential systematic effect that may produce the observed",
    "elongation is a minor north - south misalignment between the radio and optical astrometry whose offset varies across the goods",
    "- n field .",
    "however , we carried out a simulation of perturbed astrometry and we found that an rms astrometry offset of @xmath63 is required to produce the observed elongation .",
    "such an rms offset is unusually large and is therefore unlikely .",
    "nevertheless , the above elongation is quite weak . by fitting the image with gaussian models , we obtained major - axis sizes of @xmath64 ( median ) and @xmath65 ( mean ) , and minor - axis sizes of @xmath66 in both cases .",
    "all these values do not significantly deviate from the @xmath5 beam size , meaning that the intrinsic radio size of the lbgs is compact relative to our beam , and that the uncertainty in flux measurement introduced by the morphology / astrometry uncertainty is at most at a level of 1  @xmath67 .",
    "in the subsequent analyses , we assume that the lbgs are all point sources under our resolution , and we do not apply any correction to their optical positions .",
    "under such a conservative approach , our measurement may slightly under - estimate the flux of lbgs for up to 1 @xmath67 .",
    "we measured the radio fluxes of @xmath0 lbgs at their optical positions assuming point sources .",
    "we excluded sources with radio fluxes @xmath49 @xmath7jy . for the remaining 1771 @xmath68 @xmath7jy sources",
    ", we averaged their fluxes by weighting them with the inverse - square of the vla primary beam response , and subtracted a background value to obtain the final stacked radio flux .",
    "the uncertainty and the background of the above measurement were estimated with the following monte carlo simulations with the assumption that the spatial distribution of radio sources is random .",
    "we measured the radio fluxes at random positions in the radio image within the goods - n area , and excluded values higher than 20 @xmath7jy .",
    "the number of random positions is the same as that of the @xmath69jy lbgs .",
    "here we also weighted the fluxes with the inverse - square of the vla primary beam response to obtain a mean value .",
    "the measurements were repeated @xmath70 times , and the distribution of the mean radio fluxes appears to be nearly gaussian .",
    "the mean of the distribution was considered as a background and subtracted from the stacked lbg radio flux .",
    "this subtraction is to account for the contribution from confusing sources near our targets .",
    "we use the dispersion among the above @xmath70 monte carlo mean radio fluxes to represent the uncertainty of the stacked lbg radio flux .",
    "there is one important systematic effect in the above procedure .",
    "if multiple sources are blended in the image , then the stacked radio flux will be overestimated by our stacking method .",
    "various deblending methods had been used in stacking low - resolution submillimeter data ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . however , in our case , the blending effect is weaker than that in the submillimeter , because our radio image has a much higher angular resolution .",
    "here we adopt a simple approach .",
    "our blending correction is only made on lbgs with one or more lbg neighbors within @xmath60 .",
    "sources separated by more than @xmath60 ( three times the beam hwhm ) have negligible effects on each other .",
    "we consider two types of blended objects in the radio image .",
    "one is sources with only one neighbor ( 262 objects ) , and the other is sources with two neighbors ( 30 objects ) . for the first type ( pairs ) , we deblended them by assuming a gaussian profile whose fwhm is identical to the beam fwhm , and corrected for the emission contributed by their neighbors .",
    "the correction is made on each pair of objects according to their angular separation .",
    "this method is the same as the one used by @xcite .",
    "for the second type of groups , we corrected their stacked fluxes using simulations .",
    "we simulated such three - source groups by first placing one object at the image center and randomly placing the other two objects within @xmath60 from the first one .",
    "the fluxes of the individual sources are random .",
    "all sources are point sources , convolved with the @xmath5 telescope beam .",
    "we measured the fluxes at the source positions , and computed the ratio between the measured stacking flux and the total input flux .",
    "we repeated this by @xmath71 times and obtained an averaged ratio of 1.38 .",
    "we divided the flux of sources in the second type of groups by this factor .",
    "we applied the above blending corrections both to the stacked radio flux and the monte carlo fluxes .    in the above deblending procedure ,",
    "there is one subtle consideration .",
    "although we applied the same correction to both the stacked radio flux and the monte carlo fluxes , the spatial distributions ( i.e. , clustering ) of the monte carlo sources and the lbgs are not the same . to account for this",
    ", we performed another version of monte carlo simulations .",
    "instead of picking up fluxes from random positions , we used the true positions of the @xmath0 lbgs and applied a random shift to all of them in each monte carlo run .",
    "we repeated this for a thousand runs with random offsets ranging from @xmath72 to @xmath73 , and calculated their mean and dispersion .",
    "because the relative positions of monte carlo sources are kept the same as those of the @xmath0 lbgs , we applied the same blending corrections to the blended monte carlo sources .",
    "hereafter we refer the monte carlo simulations based on random positions as `` mca , '' and the monte carlo simulations based on randomly shifted real lbg positions as `` mcb . ''    finally , we compare fluxes from the isolated lbgs and the lbgs with @xmath74 neighbors .",
    "the stacked , blending - corrected flux of the 292 lbgs with neighbors is @xmath75jy , which is slightly higher than the flux of @xmath76jy for the 1479 isolated lgbs .",
    "this marginal difference is consistent with the common expectation that galaxies undergoing merging or interaction have higher sfrs .",
    "however , this @xmath77 difference has to be confirmed with more sensitive radio imaging or larger lbg samples .",

    "[ thumbnails ] we show the seven @xmath49 @xmath7jy objects .",
    "the first four @xmath100 @xmath7jy ones would have sfrs of @xmath101 , if their radio emission were powered by star formation .",
    "however , such high sfrs are close to or exceed the maximum sfr suggested in the radio studies of submillimeter sources in the goods - n @xcite , and these sources do not appear in the latest deep aztec @xcite and scuba-2 @xcite images in the millimeter and submillimeter ( mm / submm )",
    ". therefore , their strong radio emission should contain substantial contributions from radio agns .",
    "one particularly interesting object is the 104.7 @xmath7jy source , the brightest one in our lbg samples .",
    "it has an extremely blue rest - frame uv continuum , with a spectral slope of @xmath102 ( see next subsection ) .",
    "this slope can not be produced by any young stellar populations , and thus implies an unobscured agn .",

    "all the @xmath104 @xmath7jy sources are excluded in our stacking analyses .    below the above",
    "mentioned @xmath105 @xmath7jy level , it is possible to set an even lower flux threshold to prevent our stacking results from being dominated by a few bright objects . on the other hand , as mentioned in section  [ sec_image_stack ] , having a threshold close to 10 @xmath7jy would also significantly skew the results and under - estimate the mean flux . between the two extreme cases ( 30 and 10 @xmath7jy ) , we see in table  [ tab1 ] that decreasing this threshold progressively decreases the stacked mean flux , flux uncertainty , and s / n .",
    "the smooth behavior here indicates that the signal from @xmath106 @xmath7jy sources is likely to be real , and that the underlying population has a continuous contribution to the measured radio flux in the 1030 @xmath7jy interval .",
    "therefore , the choice of any threshold listed in table  [ tab1 ] is just a matter of how many brighter objects that we feel comfortable to throw away .",
    "adopting a different threshold would change the signal at @xmath107 level , and only slightly affects how we interpret the results . in the present work ,",
    "we adopt the results with a 20 @xmath7jy threshold . comparing to the dispersion of the fluxes at random positions ( dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig_fhisto ] ) , this is 7.0 @xmath67 .",
    "so we are only discarding objects that are most securely detected .",
    "we estimate the sfr of the lbgs using the stacked 1.5 ghz flux .",
    "this is done by calibrating the sfr through the widely adopted conversion between sfr and infrared luminosity of galaxies , and the local radio  fir correlation , which is traditionally defined on the rest - frame 1.4 ghz radio power .",
    "first , the rest - frame 1.4 ghz power can be expressed as @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the luminosity distance , and we assume a universal synchrotron spectral index of @xmath110 ( @xmath111 defined as @xmath112 ) . for local normal star - forming galaxies ,",
    "the radio power is proportional to the fir luminosity @xcite : @xmath113 where @xmath114 is 2.3 on average .",
    "we adopt the conversion between total infrared luminosity @xmath115 and sfr in @xcite : @xmath116 where a salpeter initial mass function is assumed .",
    "the ratio of @xmath117 is roughly 2.0 , and this is valid for a broad range of dust properties .",
    "the combination of the above equations provides @xmath118 for @xmath35 and our observed waveband of 1.5 ghz ( converting to 1.4 ghz using @xmath110 ) , the final sfr formula is then @xmath119 the sfr of our @xmath0 lbgs estimated with our stacked radio flux and the mca uncertainty is thus @xmath120 .",
    "we can also estimate the sfr using the fluxes in the @xmath44 and @xmath121 bands , which correspond to the rest - frame uv .",
    "we adopt the calibration in @xcite : @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the rest - frame uv luminosity density between 1500  and 2800  , and a salpeter initial mass function is assumed .",
    "we calculated the mean @xmath44 and @xmath121 fluxes of the 1771 @xmath124 @xmath7jy lbgs by applying the same weighting factors in the radio stacking analyses based on the vla primary beam response .",
    "the results are 0.133 @xmath7jy for @xmath44 ( 26.090 ab ) and 0.142 @xmath7jy for @xmath121 ( 26.019 ab ) , respectively , corresponding to sfrs of 5.48 @xmath10 and 5.85 @xmath10 , uncorrected for extinction .",
    "the above radio and uv sfrs represent obscured and unobscured star formation , respectively .",
    "the total star formation can be expressed as the sum of the two ( e.g. , @xcite , see @xcite for more complete discussion on composite sfr ) .",
    "therefore , the total ( radio+uv ) sfr of our lbgs is 21.521.9 ( @xmath1255.7 ) @xmath10 . the ratio between the above total sfr and the uncorrected uv sfr thus implies an extinction correction of roughly 3.8 ( @xmath126 ) .    in the studies of high - redshift lbgs , the spectral slope in the uv continuum ( @xmath14 ) is often used for estimating extinction",
    "this is because full optical - to - near - infrared sed fitting for extinction and mid / far - infrared detection of the obscured star formation are both challenging for faint lbgs .",
    "here we assume the correlation between @xmath14 and extinction on local starbursting galaxies ( m99 ) : @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the extinction at rest - frame 1600  , and @xmath14 is the spectral slope between 1300  and 2600  . with the mean @xmath44 and @xmath121 magnitudes ( converted from the mean fluxes ) ,",
    "we compute the uv spectra slope @xmath14 with the following relation @xcite : @xmath129 @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the continuum slope across 1600 to 2300  , and @xmath44 and @xmath121 are ab magnitudes . with the above equations we obtain a mean @xmath14 of @xmath132 and a mean extinction of @xmath133 mag , which corresponds to an attenuation of @xmath134 .",
    "this value agrees excellently with the extinction correction estimated with the radio and uv sfrs , which is @xmath135 with a 26% uncertainty .",
    "this implies that there do not exist substantial star forming components in these faint lbgs that are completed obscured ( cf .",

    "[ radio_uv_sfr ] , we present a comparison between the total sfr and uv sfr , for our stacked lbg sample ( diamonds ) , and the sub - sample of 20100 @xmath7jy sources ( squares ) . for the 20100 @xmath7jy sources , the extinction - uncorrected sfrs ( open squares ) are all @xmath136 , nearly two orders of magnitude less than their radio sfrs .",
    "the above @xmath14-based extinction correction ( solid squares ) increases their sfr substantially , but the corrected uv sfrs have a spread of nearly three orders of magnitude , much larger than the spread in their total sfrs .",
    "this suggests that the uncertainty of the @xmath14-based extinction correction for the most intense starbursts can go either way .",
    "it can lead to an underestimate , most likely because of the existence of completely obscured star formation .",
    "it can also lead to an overestimate , perhaps because of the existence of established stellar populations that contaminate the uv sed .",
    "the possible existence of agns further complicates the interpretations of both the radio and the uv emission .",
    "this result shows that sfrs derived with optical photometry and the @xmath14-based extinction correction should be treated with caution , at least for the most intense star - forming galaxies .",
    "an interesting question to ask here is , whether the @xmath14-based extinction correction also produces such a huge scatter on fainter lbgs ? naively speaking , lbgs with sfrs of @xmath137 should be less massive and less dusty , and thus have less extinction .",
    "this is supported by many previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the moderate extinction correction ( @xmath61 ) inferred for our stacked lbg sample . on the other hand , it is interesting to note that even for the @xmath49 @xmath7jy objects , the mean of their extinction - corrected uv sfr ( the vertical line in fig .",
    "[ radio_uv_sfr ] ) also agrees with their mean total sfr .",
    "therefore , although the mean total sfr and the mean extinction - corrected uv sfr of the fainter lbgs agree well , this does not rule out a large internal scatter in the @xmath14-based extinction correction .",
    "our data only show that the extinction correction leads to a correct sfr , _ on average _ , but not on individual objects .",

    "<S> we present a statistical detection of 1.5 ghz radio continuum emission from a sample of faint @xmath0 lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) . to constrain their extinction and intrinsic sfr , </S>",
    "<S> we combine the latest ultradeep vla 1.5 ghz radio image and the _ hst _ acs optical images in the goods - n . </S>",
    "<S> we select a large sample of 1771 @xmath0 lbgs from the acs catalogue using @xmath1-dropout color criteria . </S>",
    "<S> our lbg samples have @xmath228 ( ab ) , @xmath33 magnitudes fainter than @xmath4 at @xmath0 . in our stacked radio images , we find the lbgs to be point - like under our @xmath5 angular resolution . </S>",
    "<S> we measure their mean 1.5 ghz flux by stacking the measurements on the individual objects . </S>",
    "<S> we achieve a statistical detection of @xmath6 @xmath7jy at @xmath8 , first time on such a faint lbg population at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement takes into account the effects of source size and blending of multiple objects . </S>",
    "<S> the detection is visually confirmed by stacking the radio images of the lbgs , and the uncertainty is quantified with monte carlo simulations on the radio image . </S>",
    "<S> the stacked radio flux corresponds to an obscured sfr of @xmath9 @xmath10 , and implies a rest - frame uv extinction correction factor of 3.8 . </S>",
    "<S> this extinction correction is in excellent agreement with that derived from the observed uv continuum spectral slope , using the local calibration of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this result supports the use of the local calibration on high - redshift lbgs for deriving the extinction correction and sfr , and also disfavors a steep reddening curve such as that of the small magellanic cloud . </S>"
