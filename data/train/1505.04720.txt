    "the simulated gauge invariance is shown to converge for the singlet and triplet configurations on a single triangular plaquette .",
    "the proposed experiment can be extended to larger simulated lattices , which are implementable by considering setups of superconducting qubits with enhanced connectivity .",
    "the required connectivity can be achieved by using several microwave resonators , acting as non - local quantum buses , or by considering superconducting pads that can provide with multiple capacitive couplings , as schematized in fig .",
    "[ largelattice ] .",
    "for instance , we can envision , as shown in the main text , a ladder architecture that can support a singlet gauge invariant subspace , where non - abelian string dynamics could be studied .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that the scaling of the number of steps @xmath181 needed to achieve a digital error @xmath182 in a suzuki - lie - trotter decomposition is almost linear in the simulated phase of the dynamics and sub - polinomial in @xmath182 , according to the formula @xmath183 in the formula @xmath184 is the number of terms that compose a generic hamiltonian @xmath185 , and @xmath186 is the fractal degree of approximation  @xcite , which we set to @xmath187 .",

    "nevertheless , it shows that the scaling of the number of steps is efficiently solvable by a quantum simulator , not being exponential in the resources used .",
    "the exact scaling of the number of steps can not be known ( up to an exact solution of the problem , which is not addressable numerically for larger lattices ) , however it is useful to extract the dependence @xmath196 from the upper - bound formula in eq .",

    "besides these issues on error scaling and accumulation , the accesible simulation time has to be smaller than @xmath200 and @xmath201 of the single qubits , defining a system of necessary conditions for the simulation of a lattice of @xmath52 plaquettes @xmath202      in the main text we have focused on pure gauge dynamics with plaquette interactions , where usual perturbative approaches do not get energy scales which are big enough . in this section ,",
    "we point out the basic elements needed for the simulation of the simplest @xmath0 gauge model coupled to a matter field in @xmath203-dimensions .",
    "the basic ingredients and the validity of the different energy - scale regimes have been already discussed in the simulation of abelian gauge models in trapped ions and superconducting circuits @xcite .",

    "one way to obtain the previous hamiltonian is to start with operators that respect one of the symmetries at the fundamental level and introduce an energy penalty for the combinations of operators that do not fulfill the second symmetry . in general",
    ", it is simpler to enforce the abelian @xmath210 symmetry , since it only requires density - density interaction , and start with interactions that fulfill the non - abelian symmetry from the beginning .",
