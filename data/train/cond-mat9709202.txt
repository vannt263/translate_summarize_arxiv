    "in this paper we consider the transresistivity of a system of two identical parallel two - dimensional electronic layers in close proximity .",
    "a current @xmath6 is driven in one layer , while the current in the other layer is kept zero .",
    "due to the interactions between the electrons at the different layers , a voltage @xmath7 develops in the second layer .",
    "for a square sample , the transresistivity is @xmath8 .",
    "first discussed twenty years ago @xcite , transresistivity is a subject of recent study , both experimental and theoretical @xcite , and in particular when the system is placed in a perpendicular magnetic field @xcite .    here",
    ", we consider the transresistivity in a strong magnetic field , with the landau - level filling fractions of the two layers being @xmath9 .",
    "we have considered this problem in detail in @xcite , neglecting the role of disorder . here",
    "we focus on the latter . due to length restrictions the discussion and references below are rather brief .",
    "we refer the reader to our previous work for a more elaborate discussion .",
    "an experimental study of coulomb drag in the regime of a partially filled landau level was recently carried out by eisenstein , pfeiffer and west @xcite .",
    "two theoretical works @xcite considered the problem from a composite - fermion approach .",
    "if the layers are sufficiently close , the main contribution to the transresistivity comes from the coulomb interactions between the electrons . in the limit of weak interlayer coupling , both in the absence and in the presence of magnetic field ,",
    "the transresistivity is given by @xcite @xmath11 ^ 2 \\",
    ",    |u_{\\rm sc}({\\bf q},\\omega)|^2 \\ , .\\ ] ] here @xmath12 is the screened interlayer coulomb interaction , @xmath13 is the single layer density - density response function ( irreducible with respect to the coulomb interaction ) , @xmath14 is the average electron density in each layer and @xmath15 is the temperature .",
    "coulomb drag is a result of scattering events between electrons of different layers , transferring momentum @xmath16 and energy @xmath17 between the layers .",
    "thus , it reflects the response of the two layers at finite wavevector @xmath18 and frequency @xmath19 .",
    "in addition to appearing explicitly in eq .",
    "( [ donald ] ) , the response function @xmath13 also determines the screening of the interlayer interaction .",
    "interaction is described in terms of @xmath20 matrices ( denoted by hats ) , with indices corresponding to the two layers .",
    "the screened interlayer interaction @xmath12 is the off - diagonal element of @xmath21 where @xmath22    the transresistivity is determined by regions of @xmath18 and @xmath19 where the integrand of eq .  ( [ donald ] ) is large .",
    "it is thus interesting to look at the poles of the integrand .",
    "they are the solutions of @xmath23 where @xmath13 was expressed in terms of the conductivity @xmath24 for physical clarification@xcite .",
    "the solutions of ( [ pole ] ) are the dispersion relations for the decay of symmetric and antisymmetric charge density modulations . in the limit of small @xmath2",
    "they are given by @xmath25 for the symmetric modulation , and @xmath26 for the antisymmetric modulation .",
    "for @xmath3 the calculation of @xmath13 is carried out in the composite - fermion picture for the half - filled landau level @xcite .",
    "response functions are @xmath27 matrices ( denoted by tildes ) , with entries corresponding to the density ( denoted by @xmath28 ) and to the transverse current ( denoted by @xmath29 ) .",
    "the electronic response function @xmath30 is expressed as @xmath31 the matrix appearing explicitly in ( [ picf ] ) is the chern - simons interaction matrix , with @xmath32 for @xmath10 .",
    "the composite - fermion response function @xmath33 describes the response of the composite fermions to the total scalar and vector potentials , including external , coulomb and chern - simons contributions .",
    "the electronic density - density response function appearing in eqs .",
    "( [ donald])([matrixdef ] ) is @xmath34 .    within the random phase approximation , in the limit of @xmath35 and @xmath36",
    ", we have @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the thermodynamical electronic compressibility of the system .",
    "this special form of @xmath13 has several consequences .",
    "first , it leads to the linear dependence on @xmath2 of the conductivity , @xmath39 . as a result ,",
    "antisymmetric charge density modulations have a very slow decay rate , with @xmath40 , that eventually leads to a large transresistivity .",
    "second , the integrand of eq .",
    "( [ donald ] ) is dominated by @xmath2 and @xmath19 along the line @xmath41 , limited by @xmath42 .",
    "hence the important contribution comes from @xmath43 , and not @xmath44 as in the @xmath45 case ( @xmath46 , typically @xmath47k , is defined below ) .",
    "finally , due to these considerations the temperature dependence of the transresistivity is @xmath4 .",
    "the leading temperature dependence of @xmath1 is @xmath48 where @xmath49 typically @xmath50 is a small parameter .",
    "the calculation sketched above is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the use of eq .",
    "( [ pieq ] ) is valid , in the presence of disorder , for @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the single - layer composite fermion elastic mean free path .",
    "this puts a limit on the validity of the calculations sketched above @xcite , which may be expressed in terms of the single layer longitudinal resistivity as @xmath53 for typical experimental values this condition is barely fulfilled , as @xmath54  @xmath55 , while the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ validity ] ) is approximately 40008000  @xmath55 .    to include disorder",
    ", we first use the boltzmann equation to find the composite - fermion response function @xmath33 @xcite . the boltzmann equation for the composite fermion distribution function @xmath56 in the presence of an electric field @xmath57",
    "is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the composite fermion effective mass . with @xmath60 ,",
    "one seeks a solution of the form @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the polar angle in the @xmath63 plane , and @xmath64 is the equilibrium fermi - dirac distribution function .",
    "the scattering term is taken here in the relaxation time approximation ( see comments below ) @xmath65 here , @xmath66 is the composite - fermion transport mean free time .",
    "solving eq .",
    "( [ be ] ) , @xmath67 is used to obtain the current in the system , using @xmath68 from which the conductivity , and hence the response functions , may be extracted .",
    "the result is    [ picfbe ] @xmath69    the diamagnetic term in @xmath70 does not come out of semiclassical calculation , and is added by hand .",
    "the electronic response function @xmath13 is found using ( [ picf ] ) .",
    "it has the correct form , eq .",
    "( [ pieq ] ) , in the clean limit ( @xmath71 ) . in the diffusive limit ( @xmath72 and @xmath73 )",
    "we obtain the diffusive response function @xmath74 the simplest form of relaxation time approximation , eq .",
    "( [ dfdtsc ] ) , may not be appropriate for the dynamics of composite fermions @xcite .",
    "however , a diffusive motion is described by a density  density response function of the form ( [ pidis ] ) .",
    "thus , we expect an improved relaxation time approximation to affect the value of @xmath75 , but not the functional form of ( [ pidis ] ) .    for low enough temperatures ( @xmath76 ) the transresistivity is dominated by the diffusive regime , and is given by ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath77 eq .",
    "( [ pidis ] ) may also describe a diffusive motion at zero magnetic field , where the diffusion constant is usually much larger than @xmath75 .",
    "indeed , at zero magnetic field and fantastically low temperatures a @xmath78 dependence of @xmath1 was predicted in @xcite .",
    "the smallness of the diffusion constant in a strong magnetic field , as well as the emphasis on small @xmath2 s in the clean limit , makes the @xmath78 regime in the @xmath3 case hold at experimentally accessible temperatures .    to obtain the transresistivity in the regime of interest ,",
    "interpolating the clean and disordered limit , the full expression ( [ picfbe ] ) for @xmath33 must be used .",
    "( [ picf ] ) is then used to obtain @xmath13 , eq .",
    "( [ screened ] ) to obtain @xmath79 .",
    "the transresistivity is then given by eq .",
    "( [ donald ] ) . the integration in eq .",
    "( [ donald ] ) is carried out numerically .",
    "[ fig : rd ] shows the transresistivity for different values of disorder .",
    "the parameters used in the calculation are @xmath80  @xmath81 , @xmath82   , and @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the bare mass of the electron in gaas .",
    "the amount of disorder included is moderate : at @xmath85k we have @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 for @xmath89  @xmath55 , @xmath90  @xmath55 , and @xmath91  @xmath55 .",
    "but , as can be seen in the figure , disorder reduces the transresistivity rather significantly  by a factor of order 2 .",
    "the transresistivity remains much larger ( by 34 orders of magnitude ) than at @xmath92 .",
    "in this paper we consider the coulomb drag between two layers of two - dimensional electron gases at landau level filling fractions of @xmath93 . the coupling between the layers is discussed in purely electronic terms .",
    "we find    * coulomb drag at @xmath3 is _ much larger _ than in the absence of a magnetic field .",
    "the enhancement is due to the slow decay of density fluctuations in a strong magnetic field .",
    "* for the clean case , we find that a unique temperature dependence of the transresistivity@xmath4 . * at @xmath3 disorder reduces coulomb drag ( as opposed to its role in the absence of a magnetic field ) , leading to a @xmath78 dependence at low temperatures . in typical experimental values",
    "the effect of disorder on @xmath1 is not negligible .",
