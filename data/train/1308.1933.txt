    "galactic coronae around disc galaxies play a key role in galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "such coronae are believed to serve not only as reservoirs from which galaxies acquire baryons to build up and/or sustain galactic discs @xcite , but also as depositories of galactic feedback from various stellar descendants and supermassive black holes ( bhs ) @xcite .",
    "study of the coronae thus helps us to understand how mass , energy , and heavy elements circulate in various galaxy environments ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "two major scenarios have been proposed for the origin of the coronae around disc galaxies : one links the diffuse x - ray emission in and around these galaxies to the feedback processes of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) @xcite , star formation ( sf ) @xcite , and/or mass - loss and type  ia sne of evolved low - mass stars @xcite ; the other associates the presence of large - scale diffuse hot gas with the accretion of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this latter scenario , the density of the accretion - shock - heated hot gas increases toward the optical disk of a massive galaxy , resulting in enhanced x - ray emission that may be detectable ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    the above two scenarios are not unambiguously distinguishable , especially with little observational constraint on the hot gas bulk motion @xcite . in current galaxy formation models",
    ", the growth of stellar mass ( i.e. , the sfr ) is closely related to the gravity or the mass of the dark matter halo which also determines the radiative cooling rate ( i.e. , the x - ray emission ) of the accreted gas @xcite .",
    "therefore , the coronal soft x - ray luminosity , the galaxy stellar mass , the sfr , and the host halo mass are expected to correlate with each other , no matter how the coronae are heated . both cosmological hydrodynamical simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) and observational studies with limited sample sizes ( @xmath17 galaxies , e.g. , @xcite ) have reproduced such correlations . however , the observed correlations , or the scaling relations of the coronal luminosity with the stellar mass ( traced by the near - ir or optical luminosity ) and sfr ( often traced by far - ir or radio luminosity ) , alone are of little use in distinguishing the feedback and accretion scenarios . in addition , one also needs to treat self - consistently the feedback from both young and old stellar populations ; their relative importance changes with galaxy types .",
    "these issues can not be addressed with small samples of disc galaxies .",
    "in addition to the above two major scenarios in producing galactic coronae , there are some other mechanisms which could regulate , or even sometimes play a dominant role in determining , the x - ray properties of a corona .",
    "for example , it has been argued that a large fraction of the soft x - ray emission from nearby galaxies may actually arise directly from hot and cool gas interfaces @xcite , including shock - heating , turbulent mixing ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and charge exchange ( cxe ) @xcite .",
    "such processes may significantly enhance the soft x - ray emission , as well as lead to underestimation of hot gas temperature .",
    "another possible mechanism strongly affecting the coronal properties is the environment of a galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for example , the luminosity of a corona can be enhanced due to the compression / confinement by the thermal / ram pressure of the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) @xcite , by the presence of cool gas surrounding a galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or by the accretion of external gas @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "strong ram - pressure stripping may sometimes significantly reduce the luminosity of a corona @xcite .",
    "these secondary effects , which are poorly understood theoretically , can not be well characterized observationally with small samples of galaxies selected only for certain types or certain environments .    in paper",
    "i @xcite , we have built up a database of galactic coronae in and around 53 nearby highly - inclined disc galaxies , over broad ranges of sfr , morphological type , stellar mass , and clustering environment ( see  [ paperiisubsec : paperi ] for a brief review ) .",
    "we have provided systematical measurements of multiple coronal parameters , such as the diffuse soft x - ray scale height ( @xmath18 ) , hot gas luminosity ( @xmath0 ) , temperature ( @xmath14 ) , and iron - to - oxygen abundance ratio ( fe / o ) , as well as many derived parameters , such as density ( @xmath19 ) , mass ( @xmath20 ) , thermal energy ( @xmath21 ) , and radiative cooling timescale ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "compared to previous works , we benefit from a thorough subtraction of x - ray bright sources in the disc and a uniform data reduction of a large sample of galaxies with various properties . in the present paper , we study the correlation of these hot gas parameters with other galaxy parameters : the sfr , the infrared ( ir ) warmth ( @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the _ iras _ 60 and 100  @xmath26 fluxes ) , the stellar mass ( @xmath9 ) , the mass derived from the rotation velocity ( @xmath27 ) and the baryonic tully - fisher relation ( @xmath8 ) , the atomic ( @xmath28 ) and molecular ( @xmath29 ) gas masses , the environmental density ( @xmath30 ) , and the morphological type code ( tc ; by definition , the larger the tc value , the later - type a galaxy , with tc=0 roughly separating spiral and s0 galaxies ) . in particular , we will study the secondary correlations ( after taking out the first - order scaling relations of @xmath0 with sfr and/or @xmath9 ) in various subsamples .",
    "comparisons with recent cosmological simulations will be presented in a follow - up paper ( paper  iii , @xcite ) .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : in  [ paperiisec : sampledescription ] , we summarize the key relevant information about the galaxy sample and the x - ray measurements ( as detailed in paper  i ) and further define several physically meaningful parameters from the combination of the directly measured ones .",
    "we present the results from correlation analysis of the coronal and other galaxy properties in  [ paperiisec : correlation ] , in particular , searching for the significant secondary correlations . in  [ paperiisec : discussion ] , we compare our measurements with those of elliptical galaxies , and further explore the implications of the results .",
    "the main results and conclusions are summarized in ",
    "[ paperiisec : summary ] .",
    "here we briefly describe the sample selection , multi - wavelength parameter estimation , subsample definition , x - ray data reduction / measurement , and various potential complications in the characterization of the galactic coronae ( see paper i for details ) .",
    "the sample is selected with the following criteria : ( 1 ) optical morphological type code @xmath31 ( ranging from lenticular to bulgeless spiral ) ; ( 2 ) inclination angle @xmath32 ; ( 3 ) distance @xmath33 ; ( 4 ) foreground absorption column density @xmath34 ; ( 5 ) optical diameter @xmath35 ; ( 6 ) total non - grating _ chandra_/acis exposure @xmath36 , with two exceptions , ngc  660 ( @xmath37 ) and ngc  4666 ( @xmath38 ) ; ( 7 ) no bright agn which would prevent an effective study of the galactic corona because of scattered x - ray photons .",
    "multi - wavelength galaxy properties are calculated and/or listed , including sfr from the _ iras _ ir luminosity @xmath39 ; stellar mass @xmath9 from the _",
    "2mass _ k - band luminosity ; baryon mass @xmath8 from the rotation velocity @xmath27 and the baryon tully - fisher relation .",
    "the sample covers a broad range of galaxy properties ; e.g. , about three orders of magnitude in the sfr and more than two orders of magnitude in the stellar mass . various subsamples are further defined for comparison : starburst ( 13 galaxies ) v.s .",
    "non - starburst ( 29 ) ; clustered ( 17 ) v.s .",
    "field ( 35 ) ; early - type ( 24 ) v.s .",
    "late - type ( 29 ) disc galaxies .",
    "the _ chandra _ data of the sample galaxies are calibrated and analyzed in a uniform manner .",
    "for example , the diffuse x - ray spectrum is extracted for each galactic corona , typically from a field within a vertical distance from the galactic disc @xmath40 ( see table  [ table : combinedpara ] for the average vertical extension of this field ) , where @xmath18 is the exponential scale height of the vertical brightness profile . both the resolved and unresolved stellar contributions are excised / subtracted or quantitatively estimated .",
    "the coronal luminosity is then calculated in the 0.5 - 2  kev band and corrected for removed source areas , ccd edges , and galactic discs .",
    "similar corrections are made also for derived hot gas properties , e.g. , density , mass , thermal energy , and radiative cooling timescale .",
    "for galaxies with sufficient x - ray counting statistics , spectral constraints are further obtained on the thermal ( temperature ) and chemical ( measured in the form of fe / o abundance ratio ) states of the coronal gas .",
    "galaxies with distinct multi - wavelength characteristics , which may affect the coronal properties , are individually noted .",
    "furthermore , discussions are given about various potential complications which may cause biases to the characterization of the coronae .",
    "in particular , the effects caused by uncertainties in the thermal and chemical states of the hot gas are investigated .",
    "we find that a simple 1-t model with fixed abundance ratio plus stellar contributions is typically sufficient to characterize the overall properties of the coronal emission .",
    "the inclination angle range of our sample galaxies may cause a small systematical bias due to the potential contamination from the disc emission / absorption in moderately inclined galaxies .",
    "but this bias can not play a significant role in determining the coronal properties .",
    "several galaxies in our sample host agns ; some of them may even be responsible for some distinct diffuse x - ray features .",
    "but in general , the presence of these diffuse x - ray features related to agn does not significantly affect our measurements of the global coronal properties .",
    "the cxe may significantly contribute to the soft x - ray emission in some of the sample galaxies , either active in sf or not .",
    "in particular , the unusually high x - ray luminosity of the tidally disturbed gas - rich virgo cluster member ngc  4438 could well be due to the cxe .",
    "generally , these complications should not prevent a meaningful correlation analysis , which can yield further useful insights into the nature of the x - ray emission and its relationship to galaxy properties .",
    "while relevant parameters characterizing galaxy properties have been described in paper  i , we here further define a few useful parameter combinations in our correlation analysis ( table  [ table : combinedpara ] ) .",
    "\\(1 ) mass ratio ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "@xmath8 is measured from the rotation velocity and thus traces the central gravity , as well as the total cool baryon , of a galaxy .",

    "we will further discuss its physical meaning in  [ paperiisubsec : discussionscaling ] .",
    "\\(2 ) total sn mechanical energy injection rate ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "we estimate this rate from the two types of sne : type  ia ( @xmath42 ) from the stellar mass @xcite and cc ( @xmath43 ) from the sfr @xcite , using the following explosion rates : @xmath44 @xmath45 and assuming @xmath46 per sn . the dependence of the ia sn rate on stellar population is accounted for in the calculation of stellar mass , where we have adopted the color - dependent mass - to - light ratio from @xcite ( paper  i ) .",

    "here we consider only cc sne , which contribute to the disc blowout via coherent energy input , in both space and time .",

    "the presence of the correlation may be attributed to several processes :    \\(1 ) _ stellar feedback .",

    "[ fig : abundanceratio ] ) .",
    "\\(2 ) _ mass loading of the cold ism and destruction of dust grains . _ in cold interstellar gas , iron is often highly depleted ( as compared to oxygen ) due to the formation of dust grains .",
    "the gas phase fe / o ratio of the galactic ism , for example , is typically @xmath392 @xcite .",
    "strong uv radiation in regions can destruct dust grains and hence increase the fe / o ratio to various degrees ( e.g. , @xmath393 for a sample of galactic regions according to @xcite ; @xmath394 for some extragalactic ones according to @xcite ) .",
    "the mass loading of cool gas may then lead to a relatively broad range of the observed abundance ratios of the plasma in and around normal galaxies .",

    "lines of observational evidence exist for the presence of extraplanar dust , at distances as far as 10  kpc away from actively sf galactic disc @xcite or even s0 galaxies @xcite .",
    "such dusty cool gas may be eventually loaded into coronal gas via turbulent mixing and thermal conduction .",
    "the typical sputtering timescale is @xmath395 for dust grains smaller than @xmath396 after they become mixed microscopically with the coronal gas @xcite .",
    "this timescale is significantly shorter than the typical radiative cooling timescale of the gas ( @xmath397 , paper  i ) , but can be comparable to , or even longer than , the dynamic time of the galactic outflows or superwinds through a typical observed x - ray - emitting corona of a starburst galaxy @xcite . therefore , the metal abundance pattern in the coronal gas could range from being strongly fe - depleted to reflecting a dust - free ism .",
    "in short , the present stellar feedback likely plays a key role in metal enrichment of the galactic coronae [ but there is another possibility recently raised by @xcite that the metallicity of galactic corona inferred from x - ray observations is nonproportionally affected by galactic feedbacks ( than by accretion of external gas ) because they are typically more effective in radiating x - ray ] .",
    "in addition , additional feedback from young stellar populations also provides a consistent explanation for the higher luminosity and temperature of disc galaxies than those of elliptical ones (  [ paperiisubsec : discussionelliptical ] ) .      a low x - ray radiation efficiency ( far below unity )",
    "is commonly seen in nearby galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) and known as the _",
    "`` missing galactic feedback '' _ problem , which is especially significant in galactic spheroids with little cool gas to consume or convert the feedback energy ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "[ equi : esnmtfmstellarlx ] and [ equi : esnfsncclx ] ;  [ paperiisubsec : basicscaling ] ) .    to understand the physical meaning of @xmath7 , we start with the tully - fisher relation : @xmath398 @xcite . assuming the rotation velocity @xmath27 is measured at a radius @xmath399",

    "the stellar mass is measured from the k - band luminosity ( @xmath401 ) with a mass - to - light ratio of @xmath402 , so @xmath403 , where @xmath404 is the mean k - band surface brightness within the aperture with radius @xmath405 .",
    "we could then derive the following dependence : @xmath406 in this paper , we have adopted a color dependent mass - to - light ratio , so @xmath402 is not constant , but has a typical scatter of only a factor of @xmath407 for our sample galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xmath408 depends on the photometry aperture and the rotation curve , so is not expected to have any systematic bias .",
    "for the baryonic tully - fisher relation , @xmath409 @xcite , so @xmath7 has only weak dependence on @xmath27 ; we thus neglect this term in the following discussions .",
    "finally , we only need to consider two terms in eq .",
    "[ equi : tullyfisher ] : the k - band surface brightness @xmath404 and the mass - to - light ratio @xmath410 .",
    "we herein speculate two possible explanations of the @xmath357 relation .",
    "_ firstly _ , with a roughly constant @xmath402 , @xmath404 is proportional to the mass density in the inner region of a galaxy ( within the k - band photometry aperture ) .",
    "the @xmath357 correlation thus indicates a gravitational confinement effect , i.e. , the higher the central mass density , the slower the outflow and so the larger fraction of sn energy radiated .",
    "_ alternatively _ , the @xmath357 correlation is related to @xmath410 . in the inner region ,",
    "the gravity is often dominated by stellar mass , so @xmath411 and @xmath410 is roughly constant . but",
    "@xcite found a significant departure of low mass gas - rich galaxies from the optical tully - fisher relation , which is explained by the need to include cool gas mass in the galaxy baryon content .",
    "therefore , @xmath410 , and so @xmath7 , is proportional to the richness of cool gas in a galaxy .",
    "the positive dependence of @xmath6 on @xmath7 thus means that the x - ray emission is related to the presence of cool gas . as will be discussed in  [ paperiisubsec : discussionorigin ] , cool - hot gas interaction can indeed significantly enhance the emission .",
    "this scenario is further supported by the improved @xmath357 correlation for starburst galaxies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : efficiency]e ) , which often have turbulent interstellar structures ( e.g , ngc  520 , ngc  660 , refer to paper  i for description of individual galaxies ) , and are thus expected to have increased cool / hot gas interfaces .",
    "furthermore , we notice that early - type starburst galaxies all have a relatively low @xmath6 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : efficiency]e ) , probably because of their relatively low cool gas content as compared to late - type ones .",
    "the physical meaning of @xmath10 is more apparent . by definition , it represents the driving force for the superbubble blowout from a galactic disc @xcite .",
    "in such a blowout scenario , a superbubble is created by sne and fast stellar winds of massive star clusters in the stratified atmosphere of a galactic disc .",
    "blowout occurs if the shell of the swept - up material begins to accelerate down the density gradient . at this point",
    "the rayleigh - taylor instability sets in and fragments the shell .",
    "the hot gas in the bubble then vents out into the surrounding low - density halos .",
    "further modification to this scenario includes the cooperation among multiple star clusters in driving a merged single supergiant bubble , which enables non - nuclear - starburst galaxies with disc - wide sf ( while individual star clusters of which may not be energetic enough ) to blow out hot gas .",
    "therefore , there may exist a critical @xmath412 value ( @xmath413 ) above which such a bubble can blow out .",
    "this blowout threshold is only affected by the density and thermal pressure ( temperature ) of the ambient medium @xcite .",
    "the anti - correlation between @xmath6 and @xmath412 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : efficiency]e ) , although weak , is thus quite suggestive , and can be naturally explained with the above sf - driven superbubble blowout scenario . in other words ,",
    "an increase of the energy injection rate per unit area tends to raise the specific energy or temperature of the blown - out gas , leading to a faster expansion and hence a reduction of the x - ray emissivity .",
    "a similar scenario is often suggested for agn feedback to reduce the cooling flow in the icm ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite also find an age dependence of the coronal luminosity of their median - mass subsample of elliptical galaxies .",
    "the lower coronal luminosities of younger galaxies are thought to be due to the emptying of the ism by recent sf feedback .    before going on to discuss other potential processes that may further affect the coronal x - ray emission",
    ", we need to consider some possible systematical biases which may affect the dependence of @xmath6 on @xmath7 and @xmath10 .    in  2.2.2 of paper",
    "i , we have discussed uncertainties in the measurement of @xmath27 and thus @xmath8 , which could affect the @xmath357 correlation . here",
    "we further consider the uncertainties in the _ sf size _",
    "estimation , which directly affects the measurement of @xmath412 and hence the @xmath414 correlation . in the present study , we have estimated @xmath412 using the area of a galactic disc , i.e. , @xmath47 from the optical measurement . but in the disc blowout scenario , it should be the active sf area involved in the generation of supergiant bubbles @xcite .",
    "the estimation of the sf area is not straightforward , however , because the edge - on perspective results in a heavy extinction and projection confusion , and because individual sf regions are often not well resolved even in nearby galaxies .",
    "@xcite tried to use the radio extension to define the sf region , but obtained a critical @xmath412 largely _ inconsistent _ with their analytical calculation .",
    "in contrast , the adoption of @xmath47 , uniformly measured , provided a fairly good match ( the two red solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : efficiency]f ) .",
    "this is not unexpected because the blowout scenario of the galactic coronae is a result of the cooperation of star clusters , which could be spread widely over a galactic disc . for ease of comparison for our entire sample ,",
    "we have also adopted @xmath47 as the sf size estimate .",
    "for a careful test of the blowout scenario , especially for individual galaxies , one would need to get a better size estimate ( e.g. , based on high spatial resolution mid - ir imaging observations ) .",
    "our measured x - ray radiation efficiency differs by a factor of @xmath415 from recent results ( @xmath416 ) obtained by @xcite from a _",
    "study of 29 star forming galaxies with various inclination angles .",
    "our measurements do not include a highly attenuated component in galactic discs , especially in immediate vicinities of recent sf regions , where x - ray absorption could be substantially higher than what we have assumed for the coronae or inferred from the fits to the global spectra @xcite .",
    "this component is better examined with galaxies of low inclination angles ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there are also other differences in these two studies : the inclusion of type  ia sne in our analysis , the adoption of the bolometric luminosity ( which can be very sensitive to the spectral model selection and the absorption correction ) in @xcite instead of our adopted 0.5 - 2  kev luminosity ( which is expected to be a factor of @xmath417 times lower ) , the galactic disc inclinations , and the adopted photometry apertures .",
    "we have noted unusual multi - wavelength characteristics of individual galaxies in  4 of paper  i. some of these characteristics may cause substantial departures of the galaxies from the joint scaling relations ( e.g. , eq .  [ equi : esnmtfmstellarlx ] ) .",
    "take ngc  4438 as an example , which shows the largest departure from the relation ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2dfit ] ) . as discussed in paper",
    "i , this galaxy is a member of the virgo cluster and is interacting with its companion ngc  4435 @xcite .",
    "the tidally stripped cool gas is apparently undergoing strong interaction with the icm ( as revealed by the large - scale x - ray tail ) , probably through mass loading or cxe .",
    "such processes may be responsible for the enhanced x - ray emission , which is substantially stronger than expected from the galaxy s moderate sfr and mass .",
    "similar effects ( in addition to the sn feedback and gravitational confinement considered above ) may also contribute to the x - ray emission from other galaxies .",
    "we herein examine these processes in some details :    \\(1 ) _ mass loading . _ stellar feedback is often accompanied with additional mass input ( in addition to sn ejecta ) ; e.g. , via shock heating of the surrounding ism .",
    "mass - loading to hot gas can also occur at its interfaces with cool gas via thermal conduction and turbulent mixing ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such mass loading can significantly enhance the x - ray emission @xcite , especially for gas - rich galaxies ( e.g. , ngc  5866 , @xcite ; ngc  4388 , @xcite ; also see paper  i ) . this may help to explain the higher x - ray luminosity of disc galaxies than elliptical ones in the same stellar mass range (  [ paperiisubsec : discussionelliptical ] ) .",
    "if the observed x - ray luminosity represents the thermal emission , the mass - loading may also be needed to explain the measured range of coronal temperature , which is substantially lower than that expected from the sn feedback @xcite .",
    "but physically , the mass - loading alone may be difficult to realize the narrow range of the temperature .",
    "\\(2 ) _ charge exchange .",
    "_ we have assumed that the x - ray emission from the coronae arises from collisionally excited ( thermal ) plasma .",
    "but this assumption may be problematic if the contribution from the cxe is important .",
    "in addition to increasing the soft x - ray luminosity (  5.3 of paper  i ) , the cxe could also affect the measurement of the thermal and chemical states of the coronal gas by greatly enhancing the inner - shell transitions of o , and possibly ne and mg @xcite .",
    "active sf galaxies with typically large cool gas contents tend to have a large contribution from the cxe , and show spatial correlation between soft x - ray intensity and cool gas , which can be traced by h@xmath418 or dust emission @xcite .",
    "the transitions after the cxe occur in lower ionization states than those in the thermal emission ( because of the captures of electrons by the thermal ions ) .",
    "therefore a significant cxe contribution tends to result in an underestimate of the temperature of the hot gas , if its x - ray spectrum is fitted with a thermal plasma model .",
    "therefore , the true temperatures of the coronae can be significantly higher than those measured in paper  i , which makes the discrepancy between the disc galaxies and the elliptical ones in the @xmath372 plot ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tx]d ) even more profound",
    ".    the cxe can also affect the metallicity measurement by significantly enhancing the forbidden and inter - combination lines ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the nearly constant fe / o ratio measured for the coronae of starburst galaxies may be partly a result of the saturated cxe contribution in case of active sf and large amount of cool gas .",
    "if the soft x - ray emission primarily arises from the interfaces instead of the hot plasma itself , the metal abundance can not be measured by assuming a simple thermal model . if we assume the intrinsic fe / o ratio to be @xmath419solar ( as expected in the ism with little dust depletion )",
    ", for example , the constant fe / o ratio of @xmath420 then implies that @xmath421 of the oxygen line emission may be produced by the cxe , consistent with the estimate based on high - resolution x - ray grating spectra of m82 @xcite .",
    "\\(3 ) _ environmental effects .",
    "_ the x - ray emissivity enhancement of a corona can be due to the confinement by the thermal / ram - pressure of the icm @xcite , the presence of cool gas surrounding a galaxy ( e.g. , m82 ; @xcite ) , or the accretion of external gas @xcite .",
    "it is suggested that the offset in the @xmath372 relations separately defined by x - ray luminous @xcite and faint @xcite elliptical galaxies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tx]d ) can not be attributed only to the better removal of stellar sources in the latter , but may also be partly intrinsic because many galaxies in the former sample are in dense cluster environments . on the other hand , strong ram - pressure stripping can also efficiently remove the coronal gas . both ram - pressure stripping and thermal confinement",
    "are proportional to the mass of a cluster ( ram - pressure is proportional to the velocity square of the galaxy s orbital motion in the icm , while thermal confinement is proportional to the temperature of the icm ) ; their relative importance is therefore not affected by the host galaxy halo mass .",
    "@xcite have shown that the ram - pressure dominates the confinement pressure for most of the satellite galaxies in orbit about galaxy groups and clusters , and even the @xmath422 galaxies in reverse situations are typically x - ray faint because they have already experienced strong ram - pressure stripping during early orbital motion .",
    "furthermore , the disturbances due to tidal forces of companion galaxies may also affect the dynamics of the coronal gas , as well as the stability of the cool gas disc , thus the efficiency of sf and its feedback .",
    "given all these complications , it may be expected that we find no significant correlation between @xmath0 and the environmental density @xmath30 ( @xmath423 for the whole sample ) , indicating that either the environmental effects have a large diversity ( both positive and negative roles on @xmath0 ) or that their effects on @xmath0 are relatively minor .",
    "we will further discuss the role of environmental effects in paper  iii by comparing our sample with theoretical predictions of x - ray properties of field disc galaxies from hydrodynamical simulations .",

    "comparisons are also given with corresponding properties of elliptical galaxies .",
    "we have finally explored the implications of our findings and have further discussed various uncertainties .",
    "our main results and conclusions are summarized below :    \\(1 ) a strong correlation is present between the coronal soft x - ray luminosity ( @xmath0 ) and the sfr .",
    "the same linear relation holds for both starburst and non - starburst galaxies .",
    "in contrast , the correlations of @xmath0 with the galaxy masses ( @xmath9 or @xmath8 ) are weak for the entire sample .",
    "but if only non - starburst galaxies are considered , these three correlations are then comparable .",
    "starburst galaxies show significant deviations ( offset to high @xmath0 ) from the @xmath0-mass correlations .",

    ", we have examined the properties of galactic coronae in comparison with stellar feedback in disc galaxies . in particular , we have introduced the parameter @xmath6 , based on a primarily linear correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the luminosities , as well as the thermal and chemical properties of the coronae , can be self - consistently explained with a feedback - dominated scenario , partly because we are only exploring the coronae on relatively small scales near galactic disks [ the coronae have a typical vertical extent ( expressed in five times the exponential scale height of the vertical brightness profile ) @xmath428 with a median value of @xmath429 , paper  i ] and also because very few massive ( e.g. , @xmath383 ) disc galaxies have been carefully studied , which are rare .",
    "but we do find some hints for the importance of gravitational effects , e.g. , the correlation between @xmath6 and @xmath7 as explained in the gravitational confinement scenario . in a follow - up paper ( paper  iii ) , we intend to present comparisons of our x - ray measurements with galaxy formation models and with cosmological numerical simulations , as well as with recent claimed detection of large coronae around several massive disc galaxies .",
    "we thank robert crain , ying zu , ian mccarthy , and yannick bah@xmath430 for many helpful discussions , as well as the referees of both the present paper and paper  i for their constructive comments and suggestions .",
