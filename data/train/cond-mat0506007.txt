    "understanding the interplay of rare - earth local - moment magnetism and @xmath14 transition metal itinerant magnetism is of fundamental physical interest@xcite and may help in the design of more efficient permanent magnets .",
    "the tetragonal @xmath15fe@xmath0al@xmath1 ( @xmath16rare earth ) compounds ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) are well suited for studying this interplay because of simple symmetry conditions and because the interaction between the two magnetic sublattices is rather weak : fe moments appear to order without a corresponding @xmath15 @xmath11 order .",
    "consequently , numerous studies have been performed on @xmath15fe@xmath0al@xmath1 ( r148 ) over the last 30 years and interest in these compounds has remained high.@xcite    fe@xmath0al@xmath1 .",

    "for example in dy148 at @xmath24@xmath25 the magnetic dc susceptibility rises faster than expected for curie - weiss behavior , but there are no sharp features.@xcite furthermore , the rare earth moments were found to follow the fe - moment modulation.@xcite this seems to imply that the fe@xmath26 moment interaction is stronger than the @xmath15@xmath21@xmath15 moment interaction .    of all rare earth elements , gd has two highly interesting specific features associated with its high - spin and zero - angular - momentum @xmath11 state : 1 ) high spin results in strong magnetic coupling between the localized @xmath11 and the conduction electrons , implying large magnetic interactions and the largest de gennes factor of all rare earths ; 2 ) zero angular momentum implies a spherical @xmath11 charge - cloud and no magneto - crystalline anisotropy ( mca ) resulting from crystal - electric - field effects @xmath21 the direct interplay of magnetic interactions can be studied without crystal - electric - field effects . in view of this , it is somewhat surprising that gdfe@xmath0al@xmath1 ( gd148 ) has been much less studied@xcite than r148 with other rare earths . in particular , apart from mssbauer spectroscopy,@xcite there have been no microscopic studies of gd148 .    here",

    "we provide evidence for two consecutive phase transitions at low temperature @xmath23 in addition to the nel transition at @xmath27 , and show that the two , low-@xmath23 , transitions are associated with the ordering of the gd @xmath11 moments , resulting in complex magnetic structures involving both ferro- and antiferromagnetic components .",
    "in contrast to other r148 compounds , the @xmath11-moment ordering is associated with a propagation vector that is distinct from that associated with the fe moment order , which at low @xmath23 has the same modulation as in the vicinity of the nel temperature .",

    "a flux - growth procedure may allow better control of the stoichiometry of the crystals by varying the starting composition .",
    "unfortunately , information about the ternary phase diagram @xmath15-fe - al is very limited .",

    "elements in ratios corresponding to the starting composition were first arc - melted together .",
    "the resulting ingot was placed in an alumina crucible , which was wrapped in ta foil ( to prevent any residual oxygen in the ar from reacting with the sample ) and placed in a vertical tube furnace in flowing ar .",
    "crystals were grown by heating to @xmath35 and then slowly ( @xmath36 ) cooling to @xmath37 , at which point the furnace was turned off .",
    "the flux was removed from the crystals in a second step by heating to @xmath38 , keeping the temperature for @xmath39 and then decanting , following procedures described in refs ..    for both starting compositions , we obtained crystals of the gd148 phase , as identified via powder x - ray diffraction . crystals typically grow prismatically with ( 110 ) facets and the long direction parallel to [ 001 ] , as determined with laue scattering .",
    "we obtained crystals of dimensions up to about @xmath40 .",
    "we determined , via single crystal x - ray - diffraction - structure refinement and electron - microprobe analysis ( employing single crystals of gdfe@xmath28 as standards ) , the crystals to be slightly iron deficient , but detected no al on fe sites or vice versa ( measured compositions were between gdfe@xmath41al@xmath1 and gdfe@xmath42al@xmath1 ; deviations of the al stoichiometry from @xmath43 were always less than 2 standard deviations and are not listed ) .",
    "we note that the x - ray - diffraction - structure refinement can not distinguish between a fe deficiency due to vacancies and a ( larger ) fe deficiency due to al on fe sites , both scenarios can give an equal electron density .",
    "however , assuming an al / fe mixture to retain the full occupancy of the fe site leads ( for one of the investigated crystals ) to a gdfe@xmath44al@xmath45 composition and , thus , to an excess of al . since the electron - microprobe analysis results indicated no significant variations in the @xmath46 ratio of gd to al , we did the structure refinements under the assumption that the electron density on the fe sites is caused by vacancies , although some al / fe substitution could never be excluded .",
    "whatever scenario is chosen , none of our conclusions drawn in this article are affected by the issue of whether or not some al atoms are present on the fe site , and for definiteness subsequently we will assume that the vacancy scenario is the correct one .",
    "the composition of our samples can thus be described with the empirical formula gdfe@xmath47al@xmath1 , with @xmath48 .",
    "surface scans in the electron - microprobe analysis gave no indications of compositional variations within the same crystal .",
    "since the exact iron stoichiometry varies slightly from crystal to crystal ( even within the same growth batch ) and this was found to have a significant influence on the magnetic properties ( see sec.[lowh ] below ) most of the measurements presented below were performed on the same crystal , sample i , which has a refined composition gdfe@xmath42al@xmath1 ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) . a bar cut from the crystal by a wire saw was connected with contacts for 4-point electrical - transport measurements with the current density @xmath51[110 ] ( sample ia ) .",

    ", we carried out additional magnetization measurements on several other crystals , the composition of which was determined by x - ray diffraction and electron microprobe .",
    "the additional crystals are labelled ii to vii in the order of their appearance in the text .",
    "the above measurements were performed with commercial ( quantum design ) laboratory equipment . for the high - field measurements ,",
    "the sample orientation was fixed with a two - component glue ( x60 from wgetechnik gmbh , darmstadt , germany ) .",
    "sample ib was also used in the xrms experiment , performed on the 6id - b undulator beamline in the mucat sector at the advanced photon source , argonne national laboratory .",
    "the incident energy of x - rays was tuned to the gd @xmath53 edge ( @xmath54 ) , using a liquid nitrogen cooled , double crystal si ( 111 ) monochromator and a bent mirror .",
    "sample ib was mounted on a copper rod on the cold finger of a closed cycle displex refrigerator , such that a natural ( 110 ) facet was exposed to the x - ray beam .",
    "thermal transfer was enhanced by embedding the sample in copper paste . the sample , oriented so that the scattering plane of the experiment was coincident with the @xmath55 plane , was encapsulated in a be dome with he exchange gas to further enhance thermal transfer .",
    "the incident radiation was linearly polarized perpendicular to the scattering plane ( @xmath56 polarized ) . in this geometry",
    ", only the component of the magnetic moment that is in the scattering plane contributes to the resonant magnetic scattering arising from electric dipole transitions ( @xmath57 ) from @xmath58 to @xmath59 states .",
    "furthermore , the dipole resonant magnetic scattering rotates the linear polarization into the scattering plane ( @xmath60 polarization ) .",
    "in contrast , charge scattering does not change the polarization of the incident beam ( @xmath61 scattering ) .",
    "pyrolytic graphite pg ( 006 ) was used as a polarization analyzer , selecting primarily @xmath60 polarized radiation . for @xmath62 , the polarization analyzer used",
    "reduces the detected intensity resulting from @xmath61 charge scattering by about @xmath63 , whereas the @xmath64 resonant magnetic scattering is passed with little loss .",

    "[ xrms ] , note that the intensity of the ( @xmath212 ) reflection is much too low ) this scenario is not very likely .    from high - field measurements on finely ground free powder particles of gd148 ( likely , at least roughly , corresponding to @xmath94[001 ] , itp ) , duong _",
    "et al._@xcite suggested for @xmath207 a ferrimagnetic structure with gd moments parallel , fe moments antiparallel to the field , with an antiferromagnetic fe moment order re - established only in high fields . on the one hand ,",
    "such a simple ferrimagnetic arrangement of gd and fe moments is inconsistent with our observation in the xrms experiment of the presence of the ( @xmath212 ) satellite reflection characteristic for the antiferromagnetic fe modulation even at @xmath184 [ fig .",
    "[ fig11]b ) ] . on the other hand ,",
    "a related idea would be consistent with both the xrms and the magnetization measurements : upon the ferromagnetic ordering of the gd @xmath11 moments , the fe moments _ could _ pick up a ferromagnetic component , leading to a canted antiferromagnetic structure .",
    "such a canted magnetic structure with a large ferromagnetic component may also explain why the intensity of the ( @xmath212 ) satellite reflection is about three times smaller at @xmath184 ( in the ltp ) than at @xmath183 ( in the htp ) .",
    "furthermore , it would also allow fe to influence the low-@xmath23 transitions , as indicated by the influence of fe deficiencies on all characteristic temperatures ( see sec.[lowh ] ) . the results of a recent dichroism experiment ( on a crystal ground to powder ) , which will be discussed in detail elsewhere , are consistent with such a scenario as well .",
    "this picture covers , at least for the ltp and the htp , all the data presented in the paper , but without more detailed scattering data it remains speculative . particularly concerning the itp and hfp ,",
    "the absence of scattering data makes detailed conclusions elusive .",
    "since the direction of the spontaneous ferromagnetic moment is different for the itp and the ltp , magnetocrystalline anisotropy ( mca ) is likely one of the forces driving this transition . in rare earth compounds ,",
    "mca typically arises from crystal - electric - field effects . as we mentioned in sec .",
    "[ intro ] , this source of anisotropy is absent for gd .",
    "significant mca that was nevertheless observed for both elemental gd and gd compounds has been ascribed to a combination of dipole - dipole interactions and ( mainly ) anisotropy in the @xmath59 bands.@xcite the corresponding magnetic - anisotropy energies are much lower than the magnetic - anisotropy energies resulting from crystal - electric - field effects in other rare earths .",
    "a weak magnetic - anisotropy energy might also , at least partly , explain why no latent heat could be observed at @xmath13 . in gd148 ,",
    "anisotropy in the fe @xmath14 bands might be an additional source of mca.@xcite in any case , the different spontaneous moment direction in the itp likely results in a different structure of the fe moments .",
    "the apparent shift of @xmath13 upon changing the fe stoichiometry may be taken as an indication of the involvement of fe moments in the ltp - itp transition . before going any further in the discussion of the driving forces ( there is likely a delicate balance between multiple energy scales ) of the transitions between ltp , itp , and hfp",
    ", the magnetic structures of these phases need to be solved . with this aim in mind ,",
    "additional scattering experiments are planned .",
    "regardless of the details of the magnetic structure at low temperature , it is important to point out that i ) on the one hand , the fe moments have at least a component antiferromagnetically modulated in [ 110 ] direction ii ) the gd @xmath11 moments , on the other hand can _ not _ have a component ordered with the same propagation as the fe @xmath14 moments , because then the intensity of the reflections measured at @xmath184 would have to be orders of magnitude higher ( see sec .",
    "[ xrms ] ) .",
    "this is strikingly different from the behavior for example in dy148 , where the rare earth moments order at lower temperature , but then follow the fe moment modulation , and it implies a _ co - existence of two distinct orders _ associated with gd @xmath11 and fe @xmath14 moments . whereas compounds in which one magnetic sublattice orders at temperatures much lower than the other magnetic sublattice are not very rare ( indeed this was well known to be the case for r148 compounds in general ) , we are aware of only one example , prba@xmath28cu@xmath30o@xmath213,@xcite in which the magnetic sublattice ordering at lower @xmath23 has no component with the same modulation that the other sublattice has at all @xmath23 .",
    "the at low temperatures persisting antiferromagnetic modulation of the fe moments coexisting with an order of the gd moments with a large ferromagnetic component and without a component having the fe moment modulation is the central point of our paper .",
    "it may indicate a modified relation between the strength of the gd - gd and gd - fe moment interactions in gd148 as compared to other r148 compounds .",
    "as we mentioned , apart from the stronger couplings between @xmath11 and conduction electrons in general , the most peculiar property of gd is the absence of crystal - electric - field effects .",
    "it seems remarkable that in the absence of the mca due to crystal electric field effects , the magnetic behavior in gd148 is _ more _ complex than in other r148 .",
    "likely , strong crystal - electric - field effects play a central role in the magnetism in r148 ( except for gd148 ) .",
    "e.g. , in dy148 , crystal - electric - field effects press the @xmath11 moments into the crystallographic plane , making an order following the fe - moment modulation more probable , since the fe moments are already in - plane .",
    "our results on gd148 , in contrast , indicate a complex interplay of local @xmath11 and itinerant @xmath14 moments when crystal - electric - field effects are absent .",
    "we presented an extensive set of data including magnetization , electrical transport , specific heat , and x - ray resonant magnetic scattering , measured on flux - grown single crystals of gdfe@xmath0al@xmath1 .",
    "we found that two transitions at @xmath214 and @xmath215 at low temperature divide the ordered state below @xmath216 , where fe moments order antiferromagnetically with modulation along [ 110 ] , into three phases .",
    "the corresponding phase diagrams for fields applied in [ 110 ] and [ 001 ] direction were presented .",
    "gd @xmath11 moments order , mainly ferromagnetically , below @xmath12 . above @xmath13",
    "the ferromagnetic component of the moments points into a direction close to [ 001 ] , whereas below @xmath13 the ferromagnetic component is locked into the @xmath20@xmath21@xmath22 plane .",
    "the gd @xmath11 moment order is distinct from the fe - moment order at low temperature @xmath23 : the fe moments still have at least a component modulated along [ 110 ] , but the gd @xmath11 moments apparently do not have such a component .",
    "we proposed a canted antiferromagnetic structure of the fe moments at low @xmath23 , which can cover all the low-@xmath23 data presented in the paper , but to some extent still is speculative . above the transition at @xmath13",
    "likely involves a delicate balance of multiple energy scales associated with both gd and fe .    the complex magnetism in gdfe@xmath0al@xmath1 as compared to @xmath15fe@xmath0al@xmath1 compounds with other rare earths @xmath15 likely is related to a modified ratio of coupling strengths and to the absence of crystal - electric - field effects .",
    "in order to further elucidate the structure of the magnetic phases of gdfe@xmath0al@xmath1 additional scattering experiments are planned .",
