    "integrating out a subset of the degrees of freedom ( i.e. coarse - graining ) is the first step in many analyses of soft matter systems . for colloidal and polymeric suspensions",
    ", this procedure often leads to _ effective potentials _ , and much progress has emerged from exploiting the analogy between these potentials and the potentials of atomic and molecular fluids . in fact , the basic philosophy behind effective potentials is that the initial effort in deriving them is recouped when they are input into the well - oiled machinery of liquid state theory",
    ". however , coarse - graining on the wide range of length scales available in soft - matter systems leads to a much richer class of potentials than those found for their atomic and molecular counterparts ( likos 2001 ) . since liquid state theory",
    "was originally derived and optimized for the latter , this immediately implies the possible breakdown of the soft - matter @xmath0 atomic fluids analogy .    this paper will focus on a careful derivation of the effective pair potentials for colloid - colloid ,",
    "polymer - colloid and pure polymer suspensions , with a special emphasis on examples where intuition gleaned from the atomic fluid analogy begins to fail .",
    "in the first example discussed , depletion potentials are derived for highly asymmetric non - additive binary hard sphere ( hs ) mixtures .",
    "it is argued that these potentials can describe a much wider class of asymmetric binary mixtures and lead , in the low density regime of the larger species , to _",
    "energetic fluids _ , where the structure and crystallization behaviour is dominated by the effective potentials rather than the hard cores . for this reason",
    ", a careful derivation of the effective potentials is particularly important .    the second example concerns modelling polymers as `` soft colloids '' .",
    "these are represented by potentials _ without hard cores _ , leading to the concept of _ mean - field fluids _ , with behaviour quite different from the hs paradigm that underpins the theory of simple liquids .",
    "but first , let us take a careful look at the theory of simple liquids ( hansen & mcdonald 1986 ) : why has it been so successful ? perhaps the primary factor is the surprisingly widespread applicability of the hs fluid as a model of steric effects in atomic and molecular fluids .",
    "attractive forces can then be added as a perturbation to a hs reference system .",
    "this approach is sometimes called the _ van der waals picture _ of fluids , and a clear summary statement appeared in an influential review ( chandler _ et al .  _ 1983 ) :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ according to the van der waals picture , the average relative arrangements and motions of molecules in a liquid ( that is the intermolecular structure and correlations ) are determined primarily by the local packing and steric effects produced by the short - ranged repulsive intermolecular forces .",
    "attractive forces , dipole - dipole interactions , and other slowly varying interactions , all play a minor role in the structure , and in the simplest approximation their effect can be treated in terms of a mean - field  a spatially uniform background potential  which exerts no intermolecular force and hence has no effect on the structure or dynamics , but merely provides the cohesive energy that makes the system stable at a particular density or pressure . _",

    "hansen and verlet ( 1969 ) then connected structure to freezing by deriving a criterion  the first maximum peak of @xmath1 has a value of about @xmath2 near the freezing transition  that holds not only for hs fluids , but also for a much wider set of atomic fluids .",
    "these ideas were put on a firmer footing by the barker - henderson perturbation theory ( barker & henderson 1967 ) , and the more systematic weeks  chandler  andersen theory of liquids ( chandler & weeks 1970 ; weeks _ et al .  _ 1971 ) . both theories provide ways of performing quantitative calculations for fluids based on a hs reference system plus a perturbative term arising from the attractions . that these concepts can also be extended to molecular fluids with non - spherical hard - core reference systems is illustrated by a second , more whimsical , citation from the chandler , weeks , & andersen ( 1983 ) review :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ similarly the arrangements of molecules in liquid benzene are similar to the average arrangements of neighboring cheerios in a bowl of breakfast cereal , and a solution of argon in benzene should be similar to the structure achieved when blueberries are mixed with cheerios . _",

    "this is no longer true for complex fluids .",
    "instead , as we shall see in the following sections of this paper , effective potentials may induce _ qualitative changes _ in the structure and thermodynamics of soft matter systems .",
    "the van der waals picture breaks down .",
    "depletion interactions , the effective entropic potentials induced between the remaining particles when one ( repulsive and typically smaller ) component is integrated out , were first described by asakura & oosawa ( 1954 , 1958 ) .",
    "they remained largely unexplored until around 25 years ago when the experiments of vincent and co - workers ( li - in - on _ et al .",
    "_ 1975 ) and the theoretical work of vrij ( 1976 ) rekindled interest . since then , there has been a steadily increasing body of work exploiting the `` tunability '' of depletion potentials : the well - depth is typically proportional to the osmotic pressure of the small particles while the range is related to their diameters , leading to rich and interesting experimental phenomena ( see e.g. crocker _",
    "et al .  _ 1999 ; poon _ et al .  _ 1999 ; rudhart _ et al .  _ 1998 ; verma _ et al .  _",
    "1998 ) to study this further , consider a binary hs mixture of large ( species 1 ) and small ( species 2 ) spheres .",
    "the complete description of a binary hard - sphere model demands not only the specification of two hard - sphere diameters , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , but also the specification of the cross - diameter @xmath5 denoting the distance of closest approach between two dissimilar spheres .",
    "this is traditionally written as : @xmath6 when @xmath7 , the cross - diameter is simply the sum of the two radii , exactly what one would expect on purely geometric grounds ; the model is termed _ additive _ , and follows the traditional lorentz mixing rule ( hansen & mcdonald 1986 ) . in nature , however , systems will rarely be exactly lorentz additive , and in fact positive ( @xmath8 ) or negative ( @xmath9 ) _ non - additivity _ will be the rule rather than the exception .",
    "this is further illustrated in figure  [ fig2.1 ] .",
    "each large particle excludes a volume @xmath10 from the small particles .",
    "when two large particles approach to a distance less than @xmath11 , some of this volume is doubly excluded , and the small particles can gain free - volume , and therefore entropy . integrating out the small particles translates this entropy gain into an interaction between the large particles , the so - called depletion potential . if @xmath12 , i.e. the effective exclusion diameter of small particles near a large particle is larger than their mutual exclusion diameters , then @xmath8 and the system displays positive non - additivity .",
    "conversely , if @xmath13 then @xmath9 and the system displays negative non - additivity .",
    "experimental systems which display negative non - additivity include sterically or electrostatically stabilized binary colloid mixtures ( louis _ et al .  _",
    "2000@xmath14 ) .",
    "polymer - colloid mixtures typically show positive non - additivity , and in the extreme limit , @xmath15 with @xmath16 finite , the depletion potential ( @xmath17 of the appendix ) reduces to the asakura - ooswawa form ( asakura & oosawa 1958 , vrij 1976 ) : @xmath18 in the range @xmath19 ; here @xmath20 .",
    "the value at contact is given by : @xmath21 which does not depend explicitly on the small particle diameter @xmath22 or the packing fraction @xmath23 .",
    "for finite @xmath22 the effective pair potentials reduce to ( [ eq2.1 ] ) and ( [ eq2.2 ] ) only in the @xmath24 limit . deriving quantitatively accurate depletion potentials at finite @xmath4 and @xmath25 for non - additive systems",
    "has become possible due to some important new developments ( see e.g. roth _ et al .  _",
    "2000@xmath14 ) .",
    "briefly , the method works like this : for a given small particle fugacity @xmath26 , the pair - contribution to the exact effective potential , @xmath27 , is given by the difference in grand potential between a system with two large - spheres at a distance @xmath28 , and the same system with the two large spheres at @xmath29 . within a density functional theory ( dft ) approach ,",
    "this can be rewritten as : @xmath30 where @xmath31/\\delta \\rho_1 $ ] , @xmath32 $ ] being the excess intrinsic free - energy functional of the binary mixture . by employing the rosenfeld fundamental measure theory dft ( rosenfeld 1989 ) ,",
    "quantitatively accurate depletion potentials can be derived for both additive ( roth _ et al .  _",
    "2000@xmath14 ) and non - additive mixtures ( roth & evans 2001@xmath33 ) .",
    "the roth dft method extracts the effective pair - potential from the one - body correlations as shown in equation  ( [ eq2.3 ] ) . on the other hand , direct functional differentiation of the same rosenfeld dft",
    "leads to two - body correlations that are equivalent to the percus - yevick ( py ) approximation in the homogeneous limit ( rosenfeld 1989 ) .",
    "but , as shown in the appendix , py results in a poor representation of the effective pair potentials .",
    "curiously , the same dft approach provides quantitatively accurate effective potentials by one route , and rather poor potentials by another route . for this reason",
    ", some care must be taken when choosing a particular route to thermodynamics or effective potentials from a given ( approximate ) dft .",
    "the effect of non - additivity on the depletion potentials is shown in figure  [ fig2.2](a ) , where the parameters are chosen such that @xmath34 is kept constant , but @xmath4 is varied .",
    "note in particular that for positive non - additivity ( @xmath35 ) the contact value changes very little .",
    "in contrast , for negative non - additivity ( @xmath35 ) , the contact value increases markedly and can even become positive .",
    "the non - additivity can also be varied by keeping the small - particle diameter @xmath4 and the packing fraction @xmath36 fixed , as shown in figure  [ fig2.2](b ) . for positive and negative non - additivity , the oscillations due to the solvation shells remain more or less the same , but the well depth changes markedly .",
    "these trends can be understood even at the very simple level of equation  ( [ eq2.2 ] ) , valid only as @xmath37 , since changing @xmath38 while keeping @xmath4 fixed corresponds to changing @xmath16 and therefore the contact value .",
    "non - additivity has an even more dramatic effect on the virial coefficients .",
    "the additive case seems to be marginal since a very small negative or positive non - additivity markedly changes the behaviour of @xmath39 away from the additive value ( louis & roth 2000@xmath40 ) . a connection to phase behaviour can be made through the recent observation of vliegenthart and lekkerkerker ( 2000 ) , who showed that @xmath41 near the critical point of a wide variety of fluid systems .",
    "the large effect of non - additivity on the virial coefficients found by louis and roth ( 2000@xmath40 ) can therefore rationalize the large effect of non - additivity found in previous direct studies of the fluid - fluid spinodal line ( biben & hansen 1997 , dijkstra 1998 , louis _ et al .  _",
    "2000@xmath14 ) .",
    "positive non - additivity strongly favours phase - separation , while even a very small negative non - additivity has the opposite effect .",
    "more realistic two - component systems include attractive or repulsive potentials @xmath42 in addition to the hard - core steric repulsion .",
    "these can be mapped onto the non - additivity in the following way : an attractive cross - term @xmath43 or a repulsive small - small interaction @xmath44 corresponds to @xmath8 , while a repulsive @xmath43 or attractive @xmath44 lead to @xmath9 .",
    "in this way the large - small or small - small interactions can be used to `` engineer '' a very wide variety of effective potential shapes and associated fluid behaviours ( louis & roth 2000@xmath40 ) .",
    "effective depletion potentials can have a much shorter range than the hard - core diameter of the larger colloidal species .",
    "this leads to perhaps the best - known breakdown of the simple atomic fluid analogy , namely the metastability of the fluid - fluid transition w.r.t .  the fluid - solid transition for short - range potentials ( gast _ et al._1983 ; hagen & frenkel 1994 ) .",
    "as demonstrated in figure  [ fig2.7 ] , this leads to crystallization at much smaller large - sphere packing fractions than found for the archetypical freezing transition in one - component hs fluids .",
    "the relative insensitivity of the crystallization line to the form and range of the potentials shown in figure  [ fig2.7 ] is particularly striking .",
    "the determining factor is mainly the depth of the attractive well at @xmath45 , from which , for the range of potentials probed here , an approximate crystallization criterion can be derived ( louis _ et al .  _",
    "2000@xmath14 ) : the liquidus line broadens to about @xmath46 of the packing fraction at freezing for pure hs s when @xmath47 .",
    "nevertheless , this very simple criterion describes the dominant effect in the range of most interest to experiment . ]",
    "the insensitivity of crystallization to the potential range can be understood from the trends in the free - energy curve . with increasing well - depth ,",
    "the fluid branch of the free - energy in figure  [ fig2.8 ] is only mildly affected , while the solid branch develops a deep minimum , driven by close contact of the potential wells at a very high packing fraction .",
    "equilibrium between a very dense solid and a dilute fluid can now easily be achieved .",
    "( this can be seen in figure  [ fig2.8 ] by using the common tangent construction . ) .",
    "were generated with first order thermodynamic perturbation theory .",
    "they reproduce the fluid - solid phase - behaviour of short - range potentials rather well , but fail miserably for the ( metastable ) fluid - fluid transition ( dijkstra _ et al .  _ 1999@xmath33 ,",
    "louis 2000@xmath14 ) .",
    "first order perturbation theory even fails to correctly describe the second virial coefficient , so it is not surprizing that it breaks down for the fluid - fluid line . ] therefore , when the liquidus line broadens , crystallization is driven primarily by changes in the close - packed solid branch of the free energy , which probes well depths at the potential minima , but is largely independent of other features of the potentials .",
    "this is the origin of the semi - universal crystallization law found by louis _",
    "( 2000@xmath14 ) .      in the regime where the crystallization curve broadens to lower and lower packing fractions of the large - particles ,",
    "the structure can be well approximated by the very simple form : @xmath48 $ ] ( louis 2000@xmath33 ) , where @xmath27 is the two - body contribution of the exact effective potential ( eep ) described in the appendix .",
    "as demonstrated in figure  [ fig2.9 ] , this works remarkably well , even for densities as high as @xmath49 .",
    "because the fluid - fluid transition is metastable and crystallization typically sets in only for a well - depth of order @xmath50 , the @xmath51 near contact can easily approach values greater than @xmath52 in the fluid phase , which is quite different from the value for a hs reference system at the same overall density .    if experiments could directly access @xmath51 , this would lead to a very simple method to extract the effective potentials .",
    "however , experiments on pair - correlations typically access @xmath1 , where the effect of the potentials is much less clear cut , as demonstrated in figure  [ fig2.10 ] .",
    "in contrast to the van der waals picture , the effective potentials alter the @xmath1 quite markedly from the hs reference system , but similarly to the van der waals picture , where deriving the attractive contribution to the potential from an inversion of @xmath1 is very difficult ( reatto 1986 ) , quite a number of different effective potentials may result in similar behaviour for @xmath1 .",
    "the potentials in figure  [ fig2.10 ] were chosen to have nearly equal virial coefficients @xmath39 . since @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the fourier transform ( ft ) of the mayer function @xmath55 - 1 $ ] , ( which in turn provides a good approximation for the total correlation function @xmath56 in this regime ) it is not surprizing that @xmath57 should be similar for different potentials as long as @xmath39 is held constant .",
    "is enhanced by collective density fluctuations .",
    "the fluid - solid transition is mainly determined by the potential minimum , and is therefore not directly related to @xmath39 ( compare , for example , the virial - coefficients of the potentials depicted in the inset of figure  [ fig2.7 ] ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath1 , which is mainly determined by @xmath39 , will vary significantly for different potentials along the fluid - solid line .",
    "therefore the hansen - verlet criterion , or any other similar criterion based on @xmath1 , will not hold in this `` energetic fluid '' regime .",
    "the term _ energetic fluid _ applies to the fluid phase at low overall packing fraction of the large - particles ( say @xmath58 ) , as shown schematically in figure  [ fig2.7 ] .",
    "this regime opens up in short - range potential fluids when the fluid - fluid phase - line becomes metastable to the fluid - solid line , which then broadens out to very low packing fractions .",
    "while it is hard to find atomic or molecular fluids with a potential range short enough to qualify for this nomenclature , many solutes in solution are governed by relatively short - range attractive potentials . through mcmillan - mayer solution theory ( mcmillan and mayer 1945 )",
    "they can be viewed as effective atomic fluids .",
    "but in contrast to the van der waals picture described in section 2 , the attractive potentials of such energetic fluids qualitatively affect both freezing and structure :    * * freezing : * the liquidus line is determined primarily by the well - depth of the potential , and less so by other details such as its range or shape .",
    "while in the van der waals picture freezing is driven by entropic excluded volume effects , here it is driven by ( energetic ) properties of the potentials . * *",
    "structure : * the real - space structure of energetic fluids can be qualitatively described by the simple relation @xmath59 $ ] , while the k - space structure @xmath1 is well described by the baxter model at the same @xmath39 .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath1 of van der waals fluids typically resembles that of a hs fluid .",
    "+ is mainly determined by the value of the second virial coefficient rather than by other details of the potentials .",
    "examples of energetic fluids include many colloidal suspensions , where direct interactions can be of short range , or else where other ( smaller ) colloids , micelles , or polymers can act as depletants , inducing potentials such as those depicted in figure  [ fig2.2 ] .",
    "globular proteins may also fall into the same class , but their interactions are no longer spherically symmetric ( durbin & feher 1996 ; lomakin _ et al .  _ 1998 ; neal _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ; piazza 2000 ; sear 1999 ) .",
    "the radial distribution function and structure factor should still display behaviour similar to other energetic fluids , but now with an implicit orientational average over the anisotropic potentials .",
    "proteins typically crystallize at very low packing fractions , and some show evidence of a phase diagram topology similar to the one depicted in figure  [ fig2.7 ] ( frenkel 2000 ; piazza 2000 ; rosenbaum 1996 ; sear 1999 ) , with a metastable fluid - fluid line .",
    "there is also evidence that potential contacts in the crystal are very important for protein crystallization ( durbin & feher 1996 ) , which is consistent with energetic fluid behaviour and in sharp contrast to what would be expected from the van der waals picture .",
    "the semi - universality of crystallization found for spherically symmetric potentials depends on similar behaviour of the solid branch of the free - energy for different potential shapes .",
    "unfortunately , this can no longer be expected for proteins , since ( a ) the proteins are no longer spherical and ( b ) the potentials are anisotropic ( or `` patchy '' ) , leading to many possible crystal structures .",
    "in fact , as emphasized by sear ( 1999 ) , conditions ( a ) and ( b ) suggest that some proteins may be very difficult to crystallize precisely because their potential contacts are not commensurate with an allowed crystal structure .",
    "so , whether globular proteins can be usefully classified as energetic fluids remains to be seen , but they can certainly not be classified within the van der waals picture of fluids .",
    "the approach outlined here , described in more detail in ( louis _ et al .  _ 2000@xmath60 ,",
    "bolhuis _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) , is to coarse - grain the polymers by integrating out monomeric degrees of freedom , resulting in a description based on the polymer centres of mass ( cm ) . in principle , for a set of @xmath61 polymers with @xmath62 monomers each , one could calculate the eep which depends explicitly on the configuration @xmath63 of the centres of mass .",
    "the only differences with the binary - mixture case described in the appendix are : ( 1 ) there is no explicit additional dependence on the monomer density ( or fugacity ) , since that is fixed by the number of polymers in the set @xmath63 , and ( 2 ) there is no _ direct _ interaction @xmath64 ; the polymer - polymer effective potential arises solely from the coarse - graining procedure .",
    "the eep now takes the form : @xmath65 and again , each term could in principle be calculated separately , but this rapidly becomes intractable .",
    "instead , one can follow the second route described in the appendix and include all higher order terms in equation  ( [ eq3.1 ] ) through the density dependence of an effective pair potential @xmath66 , which exactly reproduces the cm pair - correlations at a given density @xmath67 . to do so , we first perform monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of self avoiding walk @xmath68 chains on a simple cubic lattice and extract the radial - distribution functions @xmath51 between the cm .",
    "these are then inverted through an ornstein - zernike procedure using the hypernetted - chain closure ( hnc ) , which has been shown to be quasi - exact for the potentials under consideration ( louis _ et al._2000@xmath33 , 2000@xmath69 , bolhuis _ et al .",
    "figure  [ fig3.1 ] shows both the radial - distribution functions and the effective potentials inverted from the @xmath51 .",
    "according to the theorems discussed in the appendix , the effective - potentials should , through the pair - correlations and equation  ( [ eqa.13 ] ) , reproduce the contributions to the ( osmotic ) compressibility induced by the eep  ( [ eq3.1 ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig3.2 ] shows that the total compressibility is very well approximated in this approach , implying that , in contrast to the binary fluid case , the volume term contribution ( defined in the appendix ) is small .",
    "the difference in volume terms is most likely due to the fact that the number of monomers is fixed by the number of polymers , instead of being free to vary as is the case for the small particles in the binary mixture .",
    "in fact , if the polymers were rigid , their cm correlations would exactly determine the compressibility ( see e.g.  hansen & mcdonald 1986 ch 12 ) .",
    "the effective potentials shown in figure  [ fig3.1 ] are radically different from the usual hard - core plus attraction form found for atomic systems , immediately suggesting different fluid behaviour .",
    "already the radial distribution functions in figure  [ fig3.1 ] appear to be quite different from their atomic - fluid counterparts .",
    "the structure of fluids described by these potentials is well approximated by the simple random phase approximation over a surprizingly large density range ( louis _ et al .  _ 2000@xmath69 ,",
    "likos _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) . marked differences with atomic fluid behaviour also arise at the level of thermodynamics , where the equation of state ( eos ) is very well described by the following mean - field form : @xmath70 as shown in figure  [ fig3.3 ] , this also hold for integrable potentials which diverge at the origin .",
    "equation  ( [ eq3.2 ] ) demonstrates that what matters is the value of the ft of the potential at the origin , @xmath71 , which is finite for all 3 potentials , and , in figure  [ fig3.3 ] , chosen to have the same value to ensure that the three eos are very close .",
    "the quasi - linear behaviour of the eos resembles that of an atomic fluid in the second virial approximation , but , in fact , the three potentials have virial coefficients differing by about @xmath72 .",
    "more seriously , the virial expansion has a surprisingly small radius of convergence so that adding higher order virial coefficients results in a much poorer approximation ( louis _ et al .  _",
    "2000@xmath69 ) , as demonstrated by the third order virial expansions in figure  [ fig3.3 ] .    instead of the cm , end - points or mid - points",
    "could also be used to construct an effective particle picture of interacting polymer solutions .",
    "for example , the mid - point representation would be very similar to the two - arm limit of a star - polymer , for which a number of results have been recently derived ( likos _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ; likos 2001 ; watzlawek _ et al .",

    "is compared to a more recent expression for the mid - point  mid - point interaction ( dzubiella _ et al .  _ 2000 ) . at first sight",
    "the two appear very similar , but the slope of their respective eos differ by a factor of four ! the reason for this can be seen in figure  [ fig3.5 ] : since @xmath74 is proportional to the integral over @xmath75 , it is the small differences ( much less than @xmath76 ) in the tails of the two @xmath77 that determine the large differences in the eos .",
    "interestingly the two radial - distribution functions are again quite similar ( although the associated structure factors are not ) .",
    "a necessary , but not sufficient condition for mean field fluid ( mff ) behaviour is that @xmath71 is finite .",
    "if @xmath74 is relatively large , then mff behaviour , with its quasi - linear eos and correlation functions well - described by the random phase approximation , only sets in for large enough densities . at lower densities",
    "the structure can still resemble that of a hs fluid , but the topology of the phase - diagram is quite different ( lang _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 , louis _ et al .  _",
    "2000@xmath69 ) . depending on whether the ft of the potential oscillates or not , such fluids may show either re - entrant melting or else a clustering transition for large enough values of @xmath71 ( likos _ et al._2000 ) .",
    "systems with values of @xmath71 significantly below the value that can induce freezing or clustering transitions are mff at all densities .",
    "the associated simple equation of state and fluid - structure are markedly different from the behaviour of fluids in the van der waals picture .",
    "while the van der waals picture of fluids lies at the basis of many successful liquid state theories for atomic and molecular fluids , it breaks down for the richer class of potentials arising from coarse - graining procedures in complex fluids . nevertheless , a judicious choice of techniques drawn from the theory of simple liquids may still provide insight when combined with a careful derivation of effective potentials .",
    "some recent examples of this programme include the phase - diagram of additive ( dijkstra _ et al .  _",

    "when such potentials are short ranged , they open up a region in the phase - diagram where the fluid behaviour deviates significantly from the van der waals picture , so much so in fact , that a new nomenclature , _ energetic fluids _ , has been introduced . in the energetic fluid regime , the structure can be described by a very simple form : in real space @xmath78 $ ] , while in reciprocal space @xmath1 is largely determined by the virial coefficient @xmath39 . for a wide variety of potential shapes",

    "integrating out the smaller component to derive a new one - component fluid interacting through effective depletion interactions is a useful way to treat such systems .",
    "this appendix will focus on two popular ways to derive these effective potentials :      for binary mixtures the exact effective potential ( eep ) is most easily analyzed in the semi - grand ensemble , where the number of large particles @xmath61 and the fugacity @xmath26 of the small particles is fixed ( lekkerkerker _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 , mcmillan & mayer 1945 ) .",
    "given a set of @xmath61 large particles fixed at positions @xmath63 in a volume @xmath83 , the small particles are integrated out by calculating their partition function in the fixed external field generated by the large particles .",
    "this results in an effective grand potential for the small particles of the form : @xmath84 which depends parametrically on the large - particle positions @xmath63 . to make further progress we follow the analysis of dijkstra _ et .",
    "al _ ( 1999@xmath14 , 1999@xmath33 , 2000 ) , and decompose this grand potential into n - body terms . using this mapping ,",
    "a one - component system can be derived with an an effective interaction of the form : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the direct interaction between the large spheres that is already present in the original two component system , @xmath87 is the so - called volume term ( which depends on the set @xmath63 only through the total number of large particles @xmath61 , but is independent of their relative positions ) where @xmath88 is the pressure of a pure component @xmath82 system at fugacity @xmath26 , and @xmath89 is the grand potential difference due to adding one large component @xmath81 particle to the same system .",
    "one body terms which depend on the configuration @xmath63 are zero due to translational invariance . ] , and @xmath90 is the eep which can be further expanded as : @xmath91 the pair term is simply the sum of the pair contribution to the direct interaction , @xmath92 , and the effective interaction @xmath93 induced by integrating out the small spheres .",
    "it is precisely this pair term which is measured in the laser tweezer experiments ( verma _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 , crocker _",
    "et al .  _ 1999 ) .",
    "the triplet term is a similar sum of direct and induced terms with @xmath94 the standard 3-body coordinates and so forth for n - body interactions .",
    "( since the individual terms @xmath95 depend only on the large - small and small - small interactions , their form is independent of @xmath86 , which need not be decomposable as a sum of pair terms . )",
    "the induced pair term can be rigorously defined as the difference between the grand potential of equation  ( [ eqa.1 ] ) for two particles a distance @xmath96 apart , and the grand potential when the two particles are an infinite distance apart . from ( [ eqa.3 ] ) this reduces to @xmath97 .",
    "similarly the induced three - body potential can be defined as : @xmath98 i.e. it is that part of the interaction induced by 3 large spheres which can not be described by volume and pair interaction terms alone . by continuing in similar fashion for higher and higher order terms the full eep can be built up such that the exact free energy of the mixture is given by : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is defined as the free energy of a one - component system interacting through the eep , i.e. @xmath101 = tr_1 \\exp[-\\beta w^{eff}]$ ] .",
    "in other words , by exactly integrating out the small particles for an arbitrary configuration @xmath63 , the original two - component partition sum has been rewritten as a weighted sum over large particle configurations only .",
    "the eep describes the weighting of each individual large - particle configuration in the effective one - component partition sum , while the volume term adds the left over contributions independent of the large - particle configurations .",
    "calculating the eep to all orders is usually impractical .",
    "instead what is often done is to truncate the series ( [ eqa.3 ] ) and retain only the pair potential .",
    "in many cases this is not such a bad approximation , and for a few systems it is even exact .",
    "for example , the eep for the asakura oosawa ( ao ) model ( asakura & oosawa 1958 , vrij 1976 ) with size - ratio @xmath102 is exactly described by the pair term . similarly , for @xmath103 the eep is exactly described by the pair term and a triplet term .",
    "but even for this rather simple model , the exact form of @xmath104 is very tedious to calculate ( goulding 2000 ) .",
    "thankfully , simulations have shown that neglecting the higher order terms for the ao model often works admirably well even for size ratios as large as @xmath105 , ( meijer & frenkel 1994 ; dijkstra _ et al .  _ 1999@xmath14 , 1999@xmath33 ) .",
    "the correlations functions in an effective one - component system interacting through the full eep ( [ eqa.3 ] ) are equal to the correlation functions between the large particles in the original two - component system , as long as both are at the same state point ( see e.g. dijkstra _ et al .  _ 2000 ) ) , but for other systems they can ( van roij & hansen 1997 ; van roij _ et al._1999 ; graf & lwen 1998 ; warren 2000 ) , and so must be taken into account to correctly describe the equivalent state points of the original two - component and effective one - component systems ] .",
    "for example , @xmath106 , where the first structure factor is that of the effective one - component system and the second is that of the original two - component system .",
    "this equivalence also implies that @xmath107,\\ ] ] where @xmath108 is the radial distribution function of the large - spheres .. and @xmath109 is lost in the mapping . ]",
    "similar expressions can be derived to link higher order correlation functions to higher order terms in the eep ( [ eqa.3 ] ) .",
    "hence , there is a _ direct link _ between the eep of the effective one - component system and the @xmath110 limit of the fluid correlation functions in the homogeneous phase of the original two - component model is different from the potential of mean force which is typically defined as @xmath111 $ ] for any density and is strictly speaking not a pair potential , but a restatement of the pair - distribution function .",
    "for example , a system directly interacting through a @xmath112 derived at finite @xmath113 will not have the same correlations as the original system from which the potential of mean force was derived . ]    the relation ( [ eqa.10 ] ) may be generalized to finite densities of species 1 , because there exists a one  to ",
    "one mapping : @xmath114 between a given pair distribution function @xmath51 at density @xmath113 and a _ unique _ two - body pair potential @xmath115 which reproduces @xmath51 _ irrespective of the underlying many - body interactions _ in the system ( henderson 1974 ; chayes _",
    "et al._1984 ) . since at finite densities the radial distribution function @xmath116 includes contributions not only from the pair - interactions , but also from higher order contributions to @xmath117 , the effective pair - potential includes these terms in an averaged way .",
    "it can be written as : @xmath118 which is connected to equation  ( [ eqa.10 ] ) through @xmath119 .",
    "the price paid for including the effect of all higher order terms is to introduce a density dependence in the pair - potential , but the payoff is that the pair - correlations are exactly reproduced ( but not the triplet or higher order correlations ) .",
    "thermodynamics can then be extracted through the compressibility relation : @xmath120 note , however , that volume terms can also contribute to the total eos ( dijkstra _ et al .  _ 2000 ) , so that equation  ( [ eqa.13 ] ) describes the osmotic compressibility due to species 1 only . in some cases",
    "this is only a small fraction of the total compressibility of the full two - component system ( louis _ et al .",
    "dijkstra _ et al .  _ 2000 ) .",
    "how does one perform the @xmath121 inversion ?",
