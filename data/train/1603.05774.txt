    "the recently announced diphoton excess at @xmath4  @xcite may be the first hint for physics beyond the standard model at the tev scale . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have proposed , based on stability of the theory and the strength of the signal , that this excess results from a composite spin-@xmath5 particle decaying into a two - photon final state . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have studied a particularly simple version of this , in which the @xmath0 particle is a composite pseudo  nambu - goldstone boson associated with new strong dynamics at the tev scale which is singly produced by gluon fusion and decays into two photons . in particular , we have studied a model that has an extra gauge group @xmath6 at the tev scale , in addition to the standard model gauge group @xmath7 , with extra matter  hidden quarks  in the vectorlike bifundamental representation of @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we have studied detailed phenomenology of pseudo  nambu - goldstone bosons  hidden pions",
    " one of which is the @xmath0 diphoton resonance . for related work involving similar dynamics ,",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper , we study two classes of variations of the minimal model in refs .  @xcite . for definiteness",
    ", we keep the @xmath10 quantum numbers of the hidden quarks to be @xmath11 of @xmath9 , motivated by grand unification .",
    "( note that @xmath12 here is used as a mnemonic ; it does not mean that the three factors of @xmath10 are actually unified at the tev scale . ) in the first class , we consider models in which a single diphoton resonance arises from a unique @xmath10-singlet hidden pion . after reviewing the @xmath6 model in refs .",
    "@xcite , we discuss models with @xmath13 and @xmath3 .",
    "other than being possible variations , these models have an additional motivation that the matter content is consistent with simple @xmath14 grand unified theories .",
    "we study symmetry breaking patterns and hidden pion contents , and we predict the spectra of hidden pions under the condition that the @xmath10-singlet hidden pion is responsible for the @xmath0 excess . we find that @xmath2 and @xmath3 models have extra hidden pions beyond those in the @xmath1 model , which can be used to discriminate among models .",
    "in fact , in terms of the hidden pion phenomenology , the models discussed here essentially cover the whole possibilities with the hidden quarks in a single representation of @xmath8 and @xmath11 of @xmath9 . in the second class ,",
    "we consider models in which multiple ( two ) diphoton resonances arise from hidden pions . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was found that this can occur if the model contains an extra hidden quark that is charged under @xmath8 but singlet under @xmath10 .",
    "( introduction of such an extra hidden quark was motivated by cosmology there . )",
    "we study @xmath6 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 models in this class .",
    "we demonstrate how parameters of the models are determined and how other , @xmath10-charged hidden pion masses are predicted once the two diphoton resonances are observed .",
    "the composite models we discuss contain would - be stable particles which do not decay solely by @xmath8 or @xmath10 gauge interactions .",
    "if they are electrically or color charged , their lifetimes must be short enough to evade cosmological constraints . the cosmological constraints and decays of would - be stable particles are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath15 .",
    "we extend these analyses to the case of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : minimal ] , we discuss models in which a single diphoton resonance arises from hidden pions . models with @xmath6 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 are considered in three subsections . in section  [ sec : non - minimal ] , we discuss models in which two diphoton resonances arise from hidden pions .",
    "again , models with @xmath6 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 are considered . in section  [ sec :",
    "decays ] , we discuss cosmological constraints and decays of the would - be stable particles .",
    "here we discuss variations of the minimal model in refs .  @xcite . after reviewing salient features of the model in section  [ subsec : su ] , we present variations in which the hidden gauge group is changed from @xmath1 to @xmath2 and @xmath3 in sections  [ subsec : so ] and [ subsec : sp ] , respectively .",
    "we discuss the symmetry breaking pattern and hidden pion spectrum in each case .",
    "we find that the @xmath2 and @xmath3 models have extra hidden pions beyond those in the @xmath1 case .",
    "the model has a hidden gauge group @xmath6 , with dynamical scale @xmath16 , and hidden quarks charged under both @xmath8 and the standard model gauge groups , @xmath10 , as in table  [ tab : su ] .. ] here , we assume @xmath17 ; the case of @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) is analyzed in section  [ subsec : sp ] .",
    "the hidden quarks have mass terms @xmath20 where we take @xmath21 without loss of generality , and we assume @xmath22 . note that the charge assignment of the hidden quarks is such that they are a vectorlike fermion in the bifundamental representation of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , so that the model preserves gauge coupling unification at the level of the standard model . throughout the paper , we assume that the hidden sector preserves @xmath23 to a good accuracy .",
    ".charge assignment of the minimal model with @xmath6 . here ,",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 are left - handed weyl spinors .",
    "we denote representations of @xmath8 by young tableaux while those of @xmath10 by the dimensions of representations . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the masses of the hidden quarks are given by @xmath26 where we assume @xmath27",
    ". the hidden quark condensations @xmath28 breaks the approximate @xmath29 flavor symmetry to @xmath30 , so we have @xmath31 hidden pions .",
    "in addition to @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 of the @xmath1 case , we now have hidden pions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pions_sp ] ) and one more set of @xmath36 and @xmath37 :  @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "physics of the diphoton resonances is again essentially the same as in the @xmath1 case . for @xmath41 , the masses of the @xmath3 hidden pions , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 ,",
    "are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : mpi_theta - sp ] .",

    "the composite models we have discussed contain would - be stable particles which do not decay solely by @xmath8 or @xmath10 gauge interactions .",
    "unless the reheating temperature of the universe is very small , they are abundantly produced in the early universe .",
    "if they are electrically or color charged , their lifetimes must be short enough to evade cosmological constraints . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we discussed the cosmological constraints and decays of these particles for @xmath6 . here , we extend these analyses to the case of @xmath2 and @xmath3 . unless otherwise stated , we consider models without standard model singlet @xmath47 s .",
    "we comment on the effects of the singlets occasionally .",
    "we first consider hidden baryons . in the @xmath3 models ,",
    "there are no stable baryonic composite particles .",
    "this is a significant merit of the @xmath3 models , since the decays of hidden baryons typically require operators with the dimensions higher than those of would - be stable hidden mesons do .",
    "the @xmath2 models have baryonic states .",
    "we assume that @xmath48 in the following . for even @xmath49 ,",
    "the lightest hidden baryon is composed of @xmath50 @xmath51 and @xmath50 @xmath52 , and is neutral under the standard model gauge group .",
    "since the thermal relic abundance of this particle is small enough , it can be stable .",
    "the mass difference between the lightest hidden baryon and other low - lying hidden baryons are of order @xmath53 or @xmath54 , which is smaller than the masses of hidden pions .",
    "thus , other low - lying hidden baryons decay into the lightest hidden baryon and standard model particles through the emission of off - shell hidden pions .",
    "their lifetimes are as large as the lifetime of the emitted hidden pion .",
    "we discuss the lifetimes of would - be stable pions later .",
    "if we introduce a standard model singlet @xmath47 , then the lightest hidden baryon can be standard model gauge charged .",
    "this is evaded if the mass of @xmath47 , @xmath55 , is sufficiently larger than @xmath56 .    for @xmath13 with odd @xmath49 , the lightest baryon is composed of @xmath57 @xmath51 and @xmath58 @xmath52 ( or vice versa ) , which is charged under the standard mode gauge group as @xmath59 . although the lightest baryon is electromagnetically neutral , direct dark matter experiments put a strict upper bound on the abundance of hypercharged particles as @xmath60  @xcite .",
    "the thermal abundance of the lightest hidden baryon is determined by the annihilation into hidden pions and is as large as @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the mass of the lightest hidden baryon .",
    "the possibility of stable hidden baryons , therefore , is excluded .",
    "the decay operators of hidden baryons depend of the size of @xmath49 . for @xmath63 , there are four fermi operators between three hidden quarks and one standard model fermion . for @xmath64 , there are operators composed of five hidden quarks and one standard model fermion . if we introduce a standard model singlet @xmath47 with @xmath65 , then the lightest hidden baryon becomes standard model gauge group neutral , composed of @xmath58 @xmath51 , @xmath58 @xmath52 , and one @xmath47 . in this case , the lightest hidden baryon can be cosmologically stable .    next , we consider hidden pions .",
    "hidden pions which have non - zero `` @xmath66 '' and/or `` @xmath67 '' numbers are would - be stable . for @xmath13 and @xmath3",
    ", these particles can decay via the following dimension-6 operators : @xmath68 where we have used @xmath12 ( @xmath69 ) notation to simplify the expression .",
    "if we introduce a standard model singlet @xmath47 , @xmath67 number is easily broken by a renormalizable interaction between the standard model higgs , @xmath51 , and @xmath47 . with this interaction , hidden pions that are would - be stable due to @xmath67 number can decay even promptly .",
    "notably , with superparticles at a low energy scale , the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : decay-6 ] ) , which leads to decays of all the would - be stable hidden pions , is generated from the dimension-5 superpotential term @xmath70 this should be contrasted with the case of @xmath6 , in which writing down superpotential terms which have dimensions smaller than 6 and lead to the decay of @xmath71 requires an introduction of a standard model singlet hidden quark .",
    "the loop of superpartners generates the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : decay-6 ] ) with @xmath72 where @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) represents the masses of superpartners , and @xmath75 is the @xmath8 gauge coupling at @xmath73 .",
    "the resultant lifetimes of the would - be stable hidden pions are @xmath76^{-1 } \\nonumber\\\\    & \\sim 10 ^ 4~{\\rm sec } \\times       \\biggl ( \\frac{m_*}{10^{16}~{\\rm gev } } \\biggr)^2       \\biggl ( \\frac{\\tilde{m}}{10~{\\rm tev } } \\biggr)^2       \\biggl ( \\frac{n}{6 } \\biggr)^{-1 }       \\biggl ( \\frac{\\lambda}{3~{\\rm tev } } \\biggr)^{-4 }       \\biggl ( \\frac{m_\\pi}{1~{\\rm tev } } \\bigg)^{-1 }       \\biggl ( \\frac{g_h}{\\pi } \\biggr)^{-4 } , \\label{eq : tau - pion}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 represents the hidden pion masses .",
    "the colored hidden pions efficiently annihilate around the qcd phase transition era  @xcite , and hence their lifetimes need only be smaller than @xmath78  @xcite .",
    "this is easily satisfied . on the other hand , the non - colored hidden pions @xmath44 and @xmath79",
    "annihilate only via electroweak interactions .",
    "their abundances after freeze out are about @xmath80 . these non - colored hidden pions decay into a pair of lepton doublets through interactions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : decay-6 ] ) .",
    "if the main decay mode is into the first or second generation leptons , the constraint from the big bang nucleosynthesis requires the lifetime to be shorter than about @xmath81  @xcite .",
    "this is satisfied for @xmath82 .",
    "if the main decay mode is into the third generation leptons , then the lifetime should be shorter than @xmath83  @xcite , requiring smaller values of @xmath84 .",
    "note that , as we have mentioned above , if we introduce a standard model singlet @xmath47 , then the @xmath44 and @xmath79 hidden pions can decay much more efficiently .    as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , conformal dynamics of @xmath8 can make @xmath84 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : decay - w ] ) small even if the suppression scale at high energies , @xmath85 , is large . in fact , a supersymmetric @xmath86 gauge theory with matter multiplets @xmath24 and @xmath25 is in the conformal window  @xcite",
    "assuming that the @xmath86 gauge theory is in the conformal phase below the scale @xmath87 , @xmath84 is given by @xmath88 here , we have determined the anomalous dimension of the operator @xmath89 by requiring that the beta function of the @xmath86 gauge coupling vanishes .    with conformal dynamics",
    ", dynamical scale @xmath90 may be related with the superpartner mass scale  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 gauge theory can be in a conformal phase above @xmath73 , and as the superpartners decouple , the theory may flow into a confining phase . for @xmath91 with @xmath24 and @xmath25 ,",
