    "it is a global , geometry - dependent quantity directly measurable in experiments and in practical applications of foams , for instance when a foam flows through a porous medium @xcite , or when one introduces an object into a foam ( analogous to sticking one s finger into shaving cream ) .    in the low - velocity limit ( in which viscous dissipation is neglected @xcite ) the total yield drag @xmath1 has two contributions .",
    "these are due to the pressure inside the bubbles , denoted @xmath2 , and the network of bubble walls ( i.e. , soap films with surface tension ) , @xmath3 .",

    "thus it suffices to find the contact points between bubble walls and the obstacle and sum all outward normal vectors to the obstacle vectorially at these contact points ( which is easy to determine for a circular obstacle ) .",
    "if the downstream geometry of the foam was the same as that upstream , the drag would be zero . since bubbles are squashed upstream and stretched downstream , the asymmetry means that there are more bubble walls pulling the obstacle downstream , and we measure a downstream elastic contribution to the drag , @xmath23 .",

    "the effect of the liquid fraction on the network drag can be understood as follows .",
    "a bubble of area @xmath15 detaches from the obstacle when its width is of order @xmath77 , and thus its length is of order @xmath112 .",
    "when @xmath80 decreases , @xmath77 decreases too .",
    "bubbles stretch more downstream , and more bubbles pack behind the obstacle .",
    "the number of bubble walls pulling the obstacle downstream increases ; simultaneously , the number of walls upstream decreases .",
    "this larger up / downstream asymmetry results in an increase in the resulting drag @xmath3 .",
    "the contribution from the network ( or bubble walls ) increases as their number per unit length along the obstacle boundary , namely @xmath113 , and thus scales like @xmath114 .",
    "however , the length of the region on which stretched bubbles act decreases , and the divergence in @xmath114 is in fact softened by a geometrical factor . as shown in appendix [ sec : appendix_model ] , we can estimate this factor by integrating the bubble wall contribution around the obstacle .",

    "conversely , increasing only the bubble area @xmath15 at fixed @xmath77 simultaneously decreases both @xmath102 and @xmath117 .",
    "this has two opposing effects , the former decreasing @xmath3 , the latter increasing it , resulting in an almost constant @xmath3 ( fig .",
    "[ antagonist ] ) .",
    "( in fact there is a weak dependence on area , varying as @xmath118 . )",
    "this shows that the relevant way to vary the liquid fraction in simulations is to modify @xmath106 at given @xmath102 .",

    "direct observation of simulation images of very dry foams ( fig .",

    "the model seems to correctly describe the squashing and stretching of bubble shapes .",

    "the yield stress or yield strain is an intrinsic property of the foam . on the other hand ,",
    "the yield drag depends on the geometry of the flow : the foam does not yield _ everywhere _ around the obstacle , and especially not at angles @xmath127 from the downstream direction , as appears both in experiments ( fig .",
    "[ image_exp ] ) and in simulations ( figs .",
    "[ image_simul ] and [ image_simul_dry ] ) .",
    "this spatial dependence implies that the relation between yield stress and yield drag is non - trivial and @xmath0-dependent . in particular , in a dryer foam ( fig .",
    "[ image_simul_dry ] ) , the region where bubbles reach their maximal deformation is narrower @xcite .",
    "moreover , the flow around an obstacle involves not only shear , but also elongation , especially near the front and back of the obstacle .",
    "when @xmath0 decreases , the bubble elongation can become arbitrary large and dominates the contribution to the yield drag .",
    "to summarise , we investigate the two - dimensional flow of a foam around a circular obstacle , within a long channel .",
    "our deterministic ( surface evolver ) and stochastic ( potts model ) simulations , as well as our model and experiments , complement and validate each other .",
    "the yield drag is defined as the low - velocity limit of the interaction force between an obstacle and a flowing foam .",
    "the network contribution scales as the ratio of obstacle to bubble diameter , as long as this ratio is larger than unity , and is almost independent of the channel width .",
    "it increases ( because more and more stretched bubbles accumulate behind the obstacle ) as a power law when the liquid fraction contained in the foam decreases to @xmath128 , then saturates .",
    "having found a relevant definition of the liquid fraction , which is appropriate for experiments , simulations and theory , the dependence of yield drag with liquid fraction is well characterized .",
    "it is very different from that of local intrinsic properties such as the yield stress or shear modulus .",
    "this observation suggests that it will be difficult to deduce one quantity from the other .",
    "this should be kept in mind in future simulations , and has to be taken into account when modelling the foam behaviour .",
    "note that this definition of liquid fraction can be extended to other 2d flows in experiments ( quasi-2d foam set - ups @xcite ) or simulations .",
    "extension to 3d @xcite should also be simple , especially since the main effect of quasi-2d set - ups  external friction on the glass plate @xcite  does not seem dominant here .",
    "our present effective liquid fraction based on rheological properties ( t1s ) facilitates the comparison between 2d and 3d flows ( which is difficult when using the actual volume fraction of water @xcite ) . in simulations too , our definition immediately extends to 3d for both surface evolver , which uses as input parameter the cut - off area for a face which undergoes a t1 ; and potts model , where the voxel ( 3d pixel ) size plays the same role .",

    "more importantly for this paper , at given velocity , and especially at the limit of vanishing velocity , the drag increases with increasing foam thickness .",

    "the remaining part is attributed to the pressure contribution @xmath2 , to be described in a further paper @xcite .",
    "the spatial variation of bubble height @xmath10 due to pressure differences is always less than 10% , giving an upper limit to the spatial variations of @xmath21 .",
    "we consider here only the bubbles touching the obstacle , and the contribution of their walls to the yield drag .",
    "we assume that ( i ) the foam is truly 2d and all bubbles have the same area ( ideal 2d monodisperse foam ) ; ( ii ) pressure @xmath34 is the same for each bubble , i.e. bubble walls are straight and all plateau borders have the same radius of curvature @xmath66 ; ( iii ) the obstacle is much larger than the bubbles ( @xmath146 ) so that we can neglect its curvature at the bubble scale .",
    "this latter approximation could in principle affect the bubbles upstream , which share a long edge with the obstacle .",
    "however , it should not greatly affect the bubbles downstream , which are the main contributors to the drag .      to model a wet foam ,",
    "we apply the decoration theorem @xcite : the liquid is present only at the vertices which decorate an ideally dry foam . for a bubble touching the obstacle ,",
