    "in 2d electron systems , the electrons move in a plane in the presence of a weak random potential . according to the scaling theory of localization of abrahams _",
    "et al_.  @xcite , these systems lie on the boundary between high and low dimensions insofar as the metal - insulator transition is concerned .",
    "the carriers are always strongly localized in one dimension , while in three dimensions , the electronic states can be either localized or extended . in the case of two dimensions the electrons may conduct well at room temperature , but a weak logarithmic increase of the resistance is expected as the temperature is reduced .",
    "this is due to the fact that , when scattered from impurities back to their starting point , electron waves interfere constructively with their time reversed paths . quantum interference becomes increasingly important as the temperature is reduced and leads to localization of the electrons , albeit on a large length scale ; this is generally referred to as `` weak localization '' . indeed , thin metallic films and many of the two - dimensional electron systems fabricated on semiconductor surfaces display the predicted logarithmic increase of resistivity .",
    "the scaling theory @xcite does not consider the effects of the coulomb interaction between electrons .",
    "the strength of the interactions is usually characterized by the dimensionless wigner - seitz radius , @xmath0 ( here @xmath1 is the electron density and @xmath2 is the bohr radius in a semiconductor ) . as the density of electrons",
    "is reduced , the wigner - seitz radius grows and the interactions provide the dominant energy of the system . in the early 1980 s , finkelstein @xcite and castellani _",
    "et al_.  @xcite found that for weak disorder and sufficiently strong interactions , a 2d system scales towards a _ conducting _ state as the temperature is lowered .",
    "however , the scaling procedure leads to an increase in the effective strength of the spin - related interactions and to a divergent spin susceptibility , so that the perturbative approach breaks down as the temperature is reduced toward zero",
    ". therefore , the possibility of a 2d metallic ground state stabilized by strong electron - electron interactions was not seriously considered at that time , particularly as there were no experimental observations to support the presence of a metallic phase .",
    "progress in semiconductor technology has enabled the fabrication of high quality 2d samples with very low randomness in which measurements can be made at very low carrier densities . the strongly - interacting regime ( @xmath3 )",
    "has thus become experimentally accessible .",
    "the first observation of a metal - insulator transition in strongly - interacting , low - disordered 2d systems on a silicon surface was reported in 1987 by zavaritskaya and zavaritskaya @xcite .",
    "although identified by the authors as a metal - insulator transition , the discovery went by unnoticed .",
    "subsequent experiments on even higher mobility silicon samples @xcite confirmed the existence of a metal - insulator transition in 2d and demonstrated that there were surprising and dramatic differences between the behavior of strongly interacting systems with @xmath4 as compared with weakly - interacting systems .",
    "these results were met with great skepticism and were largely overlooked until they were confirmed in other strongly - interacting 2d systems in 1997 @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was found @xcite that in the strongly - interacting regime , an external in - plane magnetic field strong enough to polarize the spins of the electrons or holes induces a giant positive magnetoresistance and completely suppresses the metallic behavior , implying that the spin state is central to the high conductance of the metallic state .",
    "recent experiments @xcite have shown that there is a sharp enhancement of the spin susceptibility as the metal - insulator transition is approached .",
    "interestingly , this enhancement is due to a strong increase of the effective mass , while the g - factor remains essentially constant @xcite .",
    "therefore , the effect is not related to the stoner instability @xcite .    in this article",
    "we summarize the main experimental findings . of the many theories that have been proposed to explain the observations",
    ", we provide a detailed discussion of the theory of punnoose and finkelstein,@xcite as it provides numerical predictions with which experimental results can be compared directly .",
    "we end with a brief discussion of some of the unsolved problems .",
    "the first experiments that demonstrated the unusual temperature dependence of the resistivity @xcite were performed on low - disordered mosfets with maximum electron mobilities reaching more than @xmath5  @xmath6/vs ; these mobilities were considerably higher than in samples used in earlier investigations .",
    "the very high quality of the samples allowed access to the physics at electron densities below @xmath7  @xmath8 .",
    "at these low densities , the coulomb energy , @xmath9 , is the dominant parameter .",
    "estimates for si mosfets at @xmath10  @xmath8 yield @xmath11  mev , while the fermi energy , @xmath12 , is about @xmath13  mev ( a valley degeneracy of two is taken into account when calculating the fermi energy , and the effective mass is assumed to be equal to the band mass . )",
    "the ratio between the coulomb and fermi energies , @xmath14 , thus assumes values above 10 in these samples .",
    "the earliest data that clearly show the mit in 2d are shown in fig.[r(t)first ]  ( a ) .",
    "depending on the initial ( `` high - temperature '' ) value of conductivity , @xmath15 , the temperature dependence of conductivity @xmath16 in a low - disordered si mosfet exhibits two different types of behavior : for @xmath17 , the conductivity decreases with decreasing temperature following mott s hopping law in 2d , @xmath18 ; on the other hand , for @xmath19 , the conductivity increases with decreasing @xmath20 by as much as a factor of 7 before finally saturating at sub - kelvin temperatures .",

    "if the resistivity at high temperatures exceeds the quantum resistance @xmath21 , @xmath24 increases monotonically as the temperature decreases , behavior that is characteristic of an insulator .",
    "however , for @xmath1 above a certain `` critical '' value , @xmath25 ( the curves below the ",

    "a metal - insulator transition similar to that seen in clean silicon mosfets has also been observed in other low - disordered , strongly - interacting 2d systems : @xmath30-type sige heterostructures @xcite , p - gaas / algaas heterostructures @xcite , n - gaas / algaas heterostructures @xcite , alas heterostructures @xcite , and n - sige heterostructures @xcite .",

    "the main features are very similar to those found in silicon mosfets : when the resistivity at `` high '' temperatures exceeds the quantum resistance , @xmath21 ( _ i.e. _ , at hole densities below some critical value , @xmath34 ) , the @xmath24 curves are insulating - like in the entire temperature range ; for densities just above @xmath34 , the resistivity shows insulating - like behavior at higher temperatures and then drops by a factor of 2 to 3 at temperatures below a few hundred mk ; and at yet higher hole densities , the resistivity is metallic in the entire temperature range .",
    "note that the curves that separate metallic and insulating behavior have resistivities that increase with decreasing temperature at the higher temperatures shown ; this is quite similar to the behavior of the separatrix in silicon mosfets when viewed over a broad temperature range ( see fig .  [ r(t)first ] ) . below approximately 150  mk ,",
    "the separatrix in @xmath30-type gaas / algaas heterostructures is independent of temperature @xcite , as it is in si mosfets below approximately 2  k. the resistivity of the separatrix in both systems extrapolates to @xmath35 or @xmath36 as @xmath29 , even though the corresponding carrier densities are very different .      in ordinary metals ,",
    "the application of a parallel magnetic field ( @xmath37 ) does not lead to any dramatic changes in the transport properties : if the thickness of the 2d electron system is small compared to the magnetic length , the parallel field couples largely to the electrons spins while the orbital effects are suppressed .",
    "only weak corrections to the conductivity are expected due to electron - electron interactions @xcite .",
    "it therefore came as a surprise when dolgopolov  _ et al .",

    "the magnetic field where the saturation occurs , @xmath39 , depends on @xmath1 , varying from about 2  tesla at the lowest measured density to about 9 tesla at the highest .",

    "<S> the discovery of a metallic state and a metal - insulator transition ( mit ) in two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron systems challenges one of the most influential paradigms of modern mesoscopic physics , namely , that `` there is no true metallic behavior in two dimensions '' . </S>",
    "<S> however , this conclusion was drawn for systems of noninteracting or weakly interacting carriers , while in all 2d systems exhibiting the metal - insulator transition , the interaction energy greatly exceeds all other energy scales . </S>",
    "<S> we review the main experimental findings and show that , although significant progress has been achieved in our understanding of the mit in 2d , many open questions remain . </S>"
