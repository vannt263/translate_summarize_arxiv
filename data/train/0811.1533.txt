    "a full understanding of the nature and evolutionary characteristics of the extragalactic sources discovered at mid - infrared wavelengths by the spitzer space telescope ( @xmath3 ) requires comparison of the spectroscopic and photometric characteristics of these sources .",

    "* ) to determine the evolution in the universe of dusty sources , primarily starbursts and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "the fundamental method to determine representative mid - infrared spectral characteristics is to obtain spectra with the irs for unbiased samples .",
    "the primary limitation is that irs spectra can only be obtained for significant numbers of sources with f@xmath0(24@xmath1 m ) @xmath8 1 mjy . despite this limitation , it is crucial to determine as thoroughly as possible the spectral characteristics of well - defined , flux - limited samples . in the present paper ,",
    "we take an initial step toward this determination using a sample of sources discovered in mips surveys and defined only by f@xmath0(24@xmath1 m ) @xmath2 10 mjy .",
    "our objective in observing this 10 mjy sample is to determine the range of spectral characteristics among sources defined only by discovery with @xmath3 based on mid - infrared flux .",
    "the result allows a determination of how representative are spectra of the many sources observed with the irs but chosen using various other selection criteria , such as optical spectral classification or prior knowledge of the source luminosities ( e.g. the many available irs spectra of ultraluminous infrared galaxies ) .",
    "previously , we published a catalog of 50 sources @xcite from the sample determined from the mips survey of 8.2 deg@xmath9 within the bootes field of the noao deep wide - field survey ( ndwfs , jannuzi et al .",
    "1999 ) , although only the spectra of the starburst sources were presented .",
    "in the present paper , we present the complete spectral sample of the 25 extragalactic sources having f@xmath0(24@xmath1 m ) @xmath2 10 mjy in the @xmath3 first look survey ( fls ) point source catalog @xcite ; we also present and discuss the spectra of the agn within the bootes sample .    within the combined bootes and fls surveys ,",

    "the present paper is an analysis of the resulting 60 spectra of sources having f@xmath0(24@xmath1 m ) @xmath2 10 mjy .",
    "sources included within our sample were selected using only the flux limit criterion of f@xmath0(24@xmath1 m ) @xmath2 10 mjy with no other selection criteria .",
    "our sample is not , however , a complete sample of all sources in bootes and the fls having f@xmath0(24@xmath1 m ) @xmath2 10 mjy .",
    "this is primarily because nearby , extended sources ( z @xmath10 0.05 ) having previously known optical redshifts and optical spectral classifications ( usually consistent with starbursts ) were not observed with the irs . in particular",
    ", no irs spectra were obtained for the 25 extragalactic sources having f@xmath0(24@xmath1 m ) @xmath2 10 mjy in the fls extended source catalog .",
    "six of these 25 sources are within ngc or ic galaxies ; 24 of the 25 sources have optical redshifts in the national extragalactic database , with an average redshift of 0.0362 .    because of the difference between a flux limited sample and a complete sample",
    ", we do not use the present flux limited sample to determine luminosity functions or to determine the quantitative fractions of sources which fall within various spectroscopic categories , such as starbursts or agn .",
    "our primary objective is to obtain a census of sources covering a wide range of luminosities in order to determine mid - infrared spectral characterisitics as a function of luminosity . for this objective ,",
    "the most important goal is to include comparable numbers of sources within different luminosity bins .",
    "it was not efficient , therefore , to obtain numerous irs spectra of nearby starbursts having similar luminosities because the similarity among irs spectra of such starbursts is well established @xcite .",
    "in the point source catalog of the fls @xcite , there are 38 sources with f@xmath0(24@xmath1 m ) @xmath2 10 mjy . of these , 13 are bright galactic stars .",
    "the remaining 25 sources have been observed with the irs : 19 are in our program 40038 , 4 in archival program 20128 ( g. lagache , p.i . )",

    "these give low resolution spectral coverage from @xmath75@xmath1 m  to @xmath735@xmath1 m .",
    "for our new observations , sources were placed on the slit by using the irs peakup mode with the blue camera ( 13.5@xmath1 m  @xmath4 @xmath11 @xmath4 18.7@xmath1 m ) .",
    "all images when the source was in one of the two nod positions on each slit were coadded to obtain the image of the source spectrum .",
    "the background which was subtracted was determined from coadded background images that added both nod positions having the source in the other slit ( i.e. , both nods on the ll1 slit when the source is in the ll2 slit produce ll1 images of background only ) .",
    "the difference between coadded source images minus coadded background images was used for the spectral extraction , giving two independent extractions of the spectrum for each order .",
    "these independent spectra were compared to reject any highly outlying pixels in either spectrum , and a final mean spectrum was produced .",
    "the extraction of one dimensional spectra from the two dimensional images was done with the smart analysis package @xcite , beginning with the basic calibrated data products , version 15 , of the @xmath3 flux calibration pipeline .",
    "final spectra were boxcar - smoothed to the approximate resolution of the different irs modules ( 0.2@xmath1 m  for sl1 and sl2 , 0.3@xmath1 m  for ll2 , and 0.4@xmath1 m  for ll1 ) .",
    "spectra for all fls sources in table 1 are illustrated among the spectra in figures 1 - 4 .",
    "spectra for fls starbursts are in figure 1 and are truncated at 20@xmath1 m  in the rest frame because of the absence of any significant features in the low resolution spectra beyond that wavelength ; most bootes starburst spectra were illustrated in @xcite .",

    "measured spectral parameters for all starbursts with irs spectra from fls and bootes are summarized in tables 2 and 3 , and spectral parameters for all agn are in tables 4 and 5 . for purposes of classifying sources as starburst or agn for inclusion in the tables and figures , sources with strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) features are defined as starbursts , and sources with silicate absorption or emission features are defined as agn . while such classifications could be further quantified , and while there are certainly composite sources , the systematic differences between spectra defined by this simple classification are obvious when comparing the starbursts in figure 1 with the agn in figures 2 - 4 .",
    "all of the sources from the bootes and fls samples which are characterised primarily by pah emission are listed in tables 2 and 3 .",
    "these tables give measured fluxes and equivalent widths ( ew ) for pah emission features and for the [ neiii ] 15.56@xmath1 m  emission line ; continuum flux densities at 5.5@xmath1 m  and 15@xmath1 m  are also given .",
    "equivalent widths and fluxes are given for the 6.2@xmath1 m and 11.3@xmath1 m features ; these are measured within smart as single gaussians on top of a linear continuum , using the continuum baseline between 5.5@xmath1 m  to 6.9@xmath1 m  for the 6.2@xmath1 m  feature , between 10.4@xmath1 m  to 12.2@xmath1 m  for the 11.3@xmath1 m  feature , and between 14.9@xmath1 m  to 16.2@xmath1 m  for the 15.6@xmath1 m  feature . as discussed by @xcite and by @xcite , the stronger 7.7@xmath1 m feature is measured only by the flux density at the peak of the feature , which is a combination of feature strength and continuum strength , because of the large uncertainty in separating the underlying continuum from the pah feature .",
    "most values for the bootes sources in tables 2 and 3 are reproduced from @xcite .",
    "results for all fls sources and for archival bootes sources in program 20113 ( h. dole , p.i . ) derive from our new spectral extractions .",
    "the continuum strength which we choose for comparing source luminosities is measured by the flux density at rest frame 15@xmath1 m .",
    "this wavelength is chosen because it falls between pah features in starbursts , and between silicate absorption or emission features in agn . as a result",
    ", it accurately represents the continuum of the underlying dust emission .",
    "continuum fluxes , redshifts , and resulting continuum luminosities @xmath5l@xmath0 ( 15@xmath1 m ) for all pah sources are given in table 3 .",
    "this table also includes a continuum measure at 5.5@xmath1 m  , although for pah sources some of this `` continuum '' may arise from broad wings of pah emission .",
    "irs redshifts in table 3 are determined from pah emission features , assuming rest wavelengths of 6.2@xmath1 m , 7.7@xmath1 m , 8.6@xmath1 m , and 11.3@xmath1 m .",
    "for the 29 sources also having optical redshifts from spectra in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , gunn et al .",
    "1998 ) , the average difference in z between irs and optical redshifts is 0.0013 .",
    "the sdss optical classifications all agree with the irs starburst classification for the sources in table 3 , except for 3 sources noted which are optically classified as seyfert 2 and one as a narrow - line agn .",
    "spectra of pah sources displayed in figures 1 and in figures 7 - 11 are normalized by the peak flux density at 7.7@xmath1 m .",
    "this is chosen because f@xmath0(7.7@xmath1 m ) is a well defined parameter for comparing with pah sources at high redshift , where f@xmath0(7.7@xmath1 m ) is the brightest observed portion of the rest - frame spectrum and strongly influences the mips flux densities observed for faint sources @xcite .",
    "to provide a measure of spectral slope and of dispersion among spectral shapes , the ratios of continuum flux density at rest - frame 24@xmath1 m  and 15@xmath1 m  to the peak flux density f@xmath0(7.7@xmath1 m ) are also given in table 3 .",
    "figures 2 and 3 show the 16 sources from bootes and fls with silicate emission , and figure 4 shows the 8 sources with silicate absorption .",
    "spectral parameters for these silicate sources , which we classify as agn , are listed in tables 4 and 5 .",
    "the agn classifications from the irs spectra are consistent with the optical sdss classifications ( noted in table 5 ) when optical spectra are available ( 16 of the 24 sources ) .",
    "irs redshifts for the silicate sources in table 5 are not as accurate as for the pah sources in table 3 , because fewer narrow spectral features are available for measure .",
    "only 8 silicate sources have confident redshifts from both irs and sdss , and the average difference in z for these is 0.0088 .    because of the weakness of pah features in these sources , we list in table 4 measures ( usually upper limits ) only for the 6.2@xmath1 m  feature , and also give measures or limits for the [ neiii ] 15.56@xmath1 m  emission line .",
    "table 4 also includes optical depth @xmath12 as a measure of depth for the 9.7@xmath1 m  silicate absorption feature .",
    "this is defined as @xmath12 = ln[@xmath13(cont)/@xmath13(abs ) ] , for @xmath13(abs ) measured at the wavelength of maximum depth for absorption and @xmath13(cont ) being an unabsorbed continuum at the same wavelength , extrapolated from either side of the absorption feature as in @xcite .",
    "strength of silicate emission features is not measured because of uncertainty in defining the underlying continuum .",
    "the continuum flux density and luminosity at 15@xmath1 m  rest frame wavelength are given for the agn sources in table 5 , as well as continuum flux density at 5.5@xmath1 m .",
    "for the agn sources , which do not have strong 7.7@xmath1 m  pah emission , spectra are normalized using the continuum at 8@xmath1 m rest frame .",
    "this wavelength is chosen because it defines a localized spectral peak of the continuum for sources with strong silicate absorption ; this peak arises because of absorption features redward and blueward of the peak .",
    "the values of f@xmath0(8@xmath1 m ) are given in table 5 , along with the ratios of continuum flux densities at 15@xmath1 m  and 24@xmath1 m to the f@xmath0(8@xmath1 m ) .",
    "of the 24 agn in table 4 , 17 have redshifts from sdss , and 3 additional sources without sdss redshifts have firm irs redshifts from well defined spectral features ( strong silicate absorption or atomic emission lines ) .",
    "the irs spectra in figures 2 - 4 confirm the sdss redshifts for 8 sources ; source agn23 has an irs spectrum that indicates z @xmath7 1.1 compared to the sdss redshift of 0.35 .",
    "this source is shown in figure 2 using the irs redshift , but because of the redshift ambiguity is not used in the average spectra discussed below .",
    "sources agn3 , agn5 , agn9 and agn17 do not have sdss redshifts and do not have strong silicate absorption or atomic emission features that enable a confident irs redshift .",
    "of these four , sources agn5 , agn9 , and agn17 are shown in figures 2 - 4 at the estimated irs redshift .",
    "these estimates derive from comparisons to other spectra of known redshift by seeking the best match for rest frame spectra of these 3 sources . because of",
    "the uncertainty in z , however , sources agn5 , agn9 , and agn17 are not used in deriving our average spectra .",
    "source agn3 is particularly interesting .",
    "@xcite present a redshift distribution of all type 1 qsos in the bootes survey field with f@xmath0(24@xmath1 m ) @xmath2 1 mjy having optical redshifts determined from the agn and galaxy evolution survey ( ages , cool et al . 2006 ) .",
    "although individual ages redshifts are not published , the distribution of redshifts and 24@xmath1 m  fluxes in figure 8 of brown et al . show that a type 1 qso is present in bootes having f@xmath0(24@xmath1 m ) @xmath2 10 mjy and z = 2.4 .",
    "this source must be in our 10 mjy bootes sample because sources were chosen from the same survey , but it is not among the sources with either sdss redshifts or firm irs redshifts .",
    "a luminous type 1 qso should show strong silicate emission @xcite . of the three bootes sources in table 4 without firm sdss or irs redshifts , source 3 is the only source whose irs spectrum is consistent with a strong silicate emission source at z = 2.4 .",
    "as seen in figure 3 , the rest frame spectrum of this source shows an increasing continuum at @xmath7 10@xmath1 m  that is just as expected for the onset of a strong 9.7@xmath1 m  silicate emission feature .",
    "we note also in figure 3 the close similarity of the rest - frame spectrum of source agn3 to that of source agn21 , a type 1 qso with a known sdss redshift and the most luminous source in our 10 mjy sample , as discussed below .",
    "the mips flux of source agn3 @xcite of 10.3 mjy is also in agreement with the flux of 10.5 mjy plotted by @xcite .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that source agn3 is the qso at z = 2.4 identified by @xcite , and we include this source in our average spectra .",
    "each source in tables 2 - 5 is individually interesting , and many comparisons could be made among various properties because extensive multiwavelength data already exist for most of these objects . for the present , we are not undertaking such an overall multiwavelength analysis except for noting in tables 3 and 5 the general agreement between optical and irs spectral classifications .",
    "the primary result we discuss here is the relation between mid - infrared luminosity and the infrared spectral characteristics .",
    "this result is crucial to understanding the nature of sources which are seen in surveys of the mid - infrared sky , and in using these surveys to determine evolutionary characteristics of starbursts and agn .",
    "this 10 mjy sample clearly shows that the most luminous sources are those with agn characteristics ( silicate features ) rather than starburst characteristics ( pah features ) . in figure 5 , the redshifts and 24@xmath1 m  fluxes are compared for sources with and without measurable pah features .",
    "it is seen that , while the flux distributions are similar , the redshifts are generally much higher for the agn , implying greater luminosities .",
    "this result is made clear in figure 6 where luminosity distributions are shown .",

    "being an intermediate mid - infrared wavelength , it is not as dominated by luminosity from the hot dust associated with agn or the cool dust associated with a starburst as would be a shorter or longer wavelength .    in figure 6 , luminosities @xmath5l@xmath0(15@xmath1 m )",
    "are compared to the ew of the 6.2@xmath1 m  pah feature .",
    "this figure shows our most important results .",
    "it shows the dramatic range in dust continuum luminosities that is covered by the sample , a factor of 2.5 x 10@xmath15 in luminosity , a range that encompasses virtually all extragalactic sources observed so far with @xmath3 , regardless of selection criterion .",
    "the faintest source is source sb11 in tables 2 and 3 , a blue compact dwarf in bootes with log @xmath5l@xmath0 ( 15@xmath1 m ) = 41.85 ( ergs s@xmath6 ) ; the most luminous sources are sources agn11 and agn21 in tables 4 and 5 , with agn11 being an absorbed silicate source and agn21 an emission silicate source , with log @xmath5l@xmath0 ( 15@xmath1 m ) = 46.2 .",

    "the change in the nature of mid - infrared spectra as a function of luminosity is also clearly shown in average spectra binned with luminosity .",

    "while these average spectra can be used as empirical spectral templates for different luminosities , the dispersion among spectra illustrates the uncertainties which arise when adopting a specific template .",
    "to allow an estimate of this dispersion within a luminosity bin , figures 8 - 11 show the continuum flux densities at 15@xmath1 m  and 24@xmath1 m  relative to the normalizing peak at 7.7@xmath1 m  ( starbursts ) or 8@xmath1 m  ( agn ) for all of the individual sources which enter an average .",
    "the figures also show the most extreme sources in each bin .",
    "all sources do not cover all rest frame wavelengths because of varying redshifts ; for example , only 3 of the most luminous sources are at sufficiently low redshift to allow a measure of rest frame f@xmath0(24@xmath1 m ) .",
    "average spectra are determined within different wavelength ranges using only the sources whose rest - frame spectra include those wavelength ranges .",
    "we use the classification `` starburst galaxies '' , or `` starbursts '' , to mean galaxies whose spectra and luminosity are dominated by the consequences of on - going star formation .",
    "a fundamental measurement of importance for starbursts is the measure of star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "mid - infrared spectra of starbursts such as those in figure 1 contain data for three indicators that give independent measures of sfr .",
    "these are the luminosity of the pah emission features ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the luminosity of the dust continuum ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the luminosity of the neon emission lines @xcite .",
    "these three indicators measure in different ways the luminosity arising from the young stars of the starburst .",
    "the pah emission is excited by photons penetrating the photodissociation region ( pdr ) at the boundary between the hii region and the surrounding molecular cloud ; the dust continuum arises from dust intermixed in the hii region and heated by the stars ; and the emission lines arise within the hii region from ionizing photons arising in the young stars .    if the geometry of the star - forming environment , the spectral distribution of stellar radiation , the temperature distribution and nature of the dust , and the gas to dust ratio were the same for all starbursts , any one of these parameters should give the same result for sfr .",
    "of course , all starbursts are not the same among these many characteristics , so different indicators of sfr give different results depending on these characteristics .",
    "although we do not attempt here an evaluation of the relative merits of various estimates of sfr , we can use the data for our 10 mjy sample of starbursts to estimate the dispersion that arises among these three different methods for measuring sfr .    for this comparison ,",
    "we utilize the 7.7@xmath1 m  pah feature , the [ neiii ] 15.56@xmath1 m  feature , and the strength of the dust continuum at 24@xmath1 m  . the flux @xmath5f@xmath0(7.7@xmath1 m ) at the peak of the pah feature measures the luminosity in the photodissociation region , the flux of the neon line measures the ionizing luminosity within the hii region , and the flux density of the continuum measures the emission from warm dust .",
    "the measures used for comparison are given in tables 2 and 3 and illustrated in figures 12 and 13 .",

    "this is a measure of luminosity arising in the pdr compared to that arising in the hii region . including the limits which are shown",

    "this result indicates that we should expect a dispersion by a factor of @xmath16 2.0 between sfr estimates from pah compared to those from [ neiii ] , even for pure starbursts .    in figure 13 , the distribution of the ratio f@xmath0(24@xmath1 m ) to f@xmath0(7.7@xmath1 m ) is shown for the sources in tables 2 and 3 with pah features .",
    "this is a measure of luminosity arising from warm dust within both the hii region and pdr compared to luminosity arising in the pdr .",
    "there is a weak trend for this ratio to change with ew(6.2@xmath1 m ) .",
    "this trend is expected , simply because ew(6.2@xmath1 m ) is also a measure of pah strength compared to the continuum . for the pure starbursts with ew(6.2@xmath1 m ) @xmath2",

    "given the many assumptions which enter the transformation from an observed spectral parameter to a sfr , the utility of our empirical result is primarily to conclude that it is possible to estimate the sfr to a factor of @xmath7 2 using several indicators within a mid - infrared spectrum , but more detailed assumptions regarding the nature of the starburst would be necessary to improve such estimates .",

    "such modeling is the fundamental source of conclusions regarding the evolution of extragalactic infrared sources , and different assumptions regarding templates give different answers .",
    "a utility of the average spectra in figures 7 through 11 and table 6 is that these comprise an empirically derived set of templates and dispersions among the templates which arise directly from a flux limited sample of sources selected only as infrared sources .",
    "these templates can be used with assumptions for luminosity functions and evolution of sources to predict source counts at mid - infrared wavelengths , although we do not at present undertake such predictions .    for now , we use the four average spectra and corresponding luminosities only to illustrate the observed mips f@xmath0(24@xmath1 m ) which would arise at different redshifts from the templates for the various luminosity bins shown in figures 7 through 11 .",

    "a particularly important implication of the results in figure 14 is that the sources at the highest redshifts which are detected in mips surveys with f@xmath0(24@xmath1 m ) @xmath8 1 mjy should only be the luminous agn without strong pah features , sources like those in figure 11 having log @xmath5l@xmath0(15@xmath1 m ) @xmath2 45.0 . for sources in this luminosity bin , the observed mips f@xmath0(24@xmath1",

    ", this evolution has been quantified to scale as ( 1+z)@xmath20 for the most luminous starbursts",
