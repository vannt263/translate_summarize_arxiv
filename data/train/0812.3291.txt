    "moreover , one expects that future experiments like compass , besiii , gluex and panda should be very efficient in the detection of heavy hybrid mesons , especially of @xmath0-type .",
    "there are two possible descriptions of hybrid mesons : first , a genuine three - body object made of a quark , an antiquark and a constituent gluon ; second , a two - body object made of a quark and an antiquark in the potential due to the gluon field in an excited state . in the framework of constituent models , it has been shown that these two pictures of the same object are , to a large extent , equivalent @xcite . in this paper , we model the heavy hybrid meson as a @xmath3 pair within an excited gluon field .    in general , the string energy , and therefore the potential energy between the static quark and antiquark in the excited gluon field is given by @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the usual string tension while @xmath9 is a term exhibiting the string excitation number @xmath10 and a constant @xmath11 .",

    "the aim of this report is to give an analytical expression for the mass of a heavy hybrid meson in the picture of an excited color field and to derive interesting physical consequences .",

    "the excellent accuracy of the afm mass formula is discussed in appendix  [ sec : comp ] through a comparison with exact numerical results .",

    "instead of considering the auxiliary field as an operator , let us consider it as a real number . in this case",

    "with the choice @xmath57 made above , @xmath58 . in this case , using results from ref .",
    "@xcite , it can be shown that formula  ( [ eq : enu0 ] ) gives an upper bound of the exact result . for @xmath59 , @xmath60 and",
    "the formula gives a lower bound .",
    "the qualities of these bounds are examined in appendix  [ sec : comp ] .",
    "it is also shown in this appendix that the expression @xmath61 with @xmath62 and @xmath63 defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : coefacd ] ) , leads to an analytical formula which reproduces very accurately ( up to 1% ) the exact results .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : enu0 ] ) is complicated but quite accurate . in order to get a better insight into this formula , it is interesting to compute several limits : @xmath64 the first two terms in the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lyg ] ) are the solution of a harmonic potential , while eq .",
    "( [ eq : lyp ] ) with @xmath65 corresponds to the solution of a linear interaction obtained with the afm  @xcite .    for the lowest excited state of the gluon field ( @xmath66 ) and for physical values of the parameters ( @xmath67-@xmath68  gev@xmath15 , @xmath69  gev , @xmath70  gev )",
    ", it comes that @xmath71-@xmath72 . in this case , @xmath25 is large enough for the choice @xmath58 to be relevant ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : coefacd ] ) ) . a harmonic oscillator band number @xmath73",
    "can thus be introduced to label the states .",
    "we can further assume that hybrid mesons with @xmath66 and @xmath74 can not be easily produced and discriminated from the low - lying @xmath75 hybrids which would lie in the same mass range .",
    "so in the following , we will only consider that @xmath76 $ ] , @xmath77 , and @xmath66 .",
    "it is indeed more probable that hybrids with the lowest possible excitation of the gluon field will be first observed .",
    "as we are interested in the study of towers of states , it could be expected that the power expansion  ( [ eq : lyp ] ) , valid for large @xmath56 , should be used .",
    "but , @xmath25 is so large for heavy quarks that it is actually not the case .",
    "for example , when @xmath78 , one has @xmath79 even with the large value @xmath80 . by comparing with accurate numerical solutions obtained for the hamiltonian @xmath81 with the lagrange mesh method @xcite",
    ", it has been checked that the power expansion  ( [ eq : lyg ] ) is far better .",
    "moreover , the ratio of the third term over the second one in this expansion is at most 10% .",
    "so with very good approximation the eigenvalues of @xmath81 are given by @xmath82 the approximate formula  ( [ eq : epsapp ] ) only depends on @xmath83 .",
    "this exact degeneracy is actually broken by the non - harmonic character of the hamiltonian @xmath81 , but the breaking is small : it can be numerically checked that the maximal relative error of eq .",
    "( [ eq : epsapp ] ) with respect to the exact values of @xmath84 is around 10% .",
    "so , @xmath83 is a relevant classification number",
    ".      the coulomb interaction must also play a role in heavy hybrids , since heavy quarks are expected to orbit close to each other and must feel strongly this short range interaction .",
    "the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : ph ] ) might then be completed with the potential @xmath85 where @xmath86 @xmath87 being the strong coupling constant and the @xmath88 factor coming from color casimir operator . since @xmath89 in the heavy meson sector @xcite",
    ", it appears that @xmath90-@xmath91 . for the large values of @xmath25 considered here ,",
    "the contribution of the potential @xmath85 can be computed in perturbation . using the afm results , one obtains @xmath92 this contribution is at most around 4% of @xmath84 for @xmath0 hybrids and 10% for @xmath1 hybrids .",
    "so , in first approximation , it is relevant to neglect the coulomb interaction in the search for towers of hybrid mesons .    under these conditions ,",
    "the mass of a hybrid meson is given by @xmath93 for high excitation of the gluon field ( @xmath94 ) , @xmath25 increases and the accuracy of the approximation  ( [ eq : mqqg ] ) improves . using the afm , an accurate mass formula for a ordinary meson with just the linear confinement",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath95 notice that @xmath66 is not the ground state of the flux tube , but rather its first excited level .",
    "the ground state simply corresponds to @xmath96 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : potex ] ) , that is a linear confining potential , and leads to formula ( [ eq : mqq ] ) .",
    "some comments have to be done at this stage .",
    "hamiltonian  ( [ eq : h ] ) describes a genuine heavy hybrid meson ( no mixing with other hadronic states ) within a spin - independent formalism .",
    "it will thus lead to qualitative global predictions rather than to a detailed mass spectrum .",
    "all spin effects are neglected but they should be weak for heavy hybrids since they are proportional to @xmath97 ",
    "see for example ref .",
    "@xcite for a numerical check of that point .",
    "we think however that such global predictions are quite robust precisely because they do not depend on a fine - tuned model . nevertheless , it is important to wonder whether our method will preferentially apply to some @xmath98 quantum numbers or not .",
    "non - exotic quantum numbers , like @xmath99 for example , must be examined very carefully because such quantum numbers allow for a possibly strong mixing with ordinary mesons .",
    "such a mixing is by definition absent for exotic quantum numbers like @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 ,  , although mixing with tetraquarks ( or even glueballs ) can not be excluded . to our knowledge",

    "we first take @xmath14  gev@xmath15 so that potential  ( [ eq : potex ] ) optimally fits the corresponding lattice qcd data  @xcite .",

    "such values are not unrealistic when compared to the pdg values of @xmath106  gev and @xmath107  gev  @xcite , and quite common in effective approaches .",
    "as already said in the introduction , the status of the @xmath99 resonance @xmath108 is not clear yet . if it is an ordinary meson , it should have @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 @xcite , and eq .",
    "( [ eq : mqq ] ) then leads to a mass of 4.512  gev , quite far from the experimental value .",
    "if it is a hybrid meson , the quantum numbers must be @xmath109 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 @xcite , and eq .",
    "( [ eq : mqqg ] ) leads to a more similar mass of 4.239  gev .",
    "but , the repulsive coulomb term would slightly decrease this agreement .",

    "@xcite ; eq .",
    "( [ eq : mqqg ] ) is compatible with the hybrid meson picture since it leads to a mass of 10.894  gev for the corresponding state .",
    "our model does not disagree with a hybrid meson assignment for both states , but no definitive conclusion can be drawn at this stage , mainly because of the neglect of the mixing with ordinary mesons .",
    "we now propose a _ modus operandi _ to separate the hybrid mesons from the ordinary ones .",
    "let us first assume that we have a sufficient amount of experimentally found @xmath3-like resonances  this should be possible in a near future thanks to the forthcoming experiments we mentioned in the introduction . then",

    "<S> a hybrid meson is a quark - antiquark pair in which , contrary to ordinary mesons , the gluon field is in an excited state . in the framework of constituent models , </S>",
    "<S> the interaction potential is assumed to be the energy of an excited string . </S>",
    "<S> an approximate , but accurate , analytical solution of the schrdinger equation with such a potential is presented . when applied to hybrid charmonia and bottomonia , towers of states are predicted in which the masses are a linear function of a harmonic oscillator band number for the quark - antiquark pair . </S>",
    "<S> such a formula could be a reliable guide for the experimental detection of heavy hybrid mesons . </S>"
