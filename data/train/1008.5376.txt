    "over the last decade great observational evidence @xcite has shown that at the present time the universe is expanding at an accelerated rate .",
    "this fact can be attributed to a component with negative pressure , which is usually referred to as dark energy , that today accounts for about 3/4 of the entire energy budget of the universe .",
    "the simplest form of dark energy is a cosmological constant term @xmath0 in einstein s equation , within the so - called @xmath0cdm cosmologies .",
    "though in good agreement with observations , a cosmological constant is theoretically difficult to understand in view of the fine - tuning and coincidence problems . a valid alternative consists in a dynamical dark energy contribution that changes in time and space , often associated to a scalar field ( the ` cosmon ' or ` quintessence ' ) evolving in a suitable potential @xcite .",
    "dynamical dark energy allows for appealing scenarios in which the scalar field is the mediator of a fifth force , either within scalar - tensor theories or in interacting scenarios . in view of future observations , it is of fundamental interest to investigate whether dark energy leaves some imprints in structure formation , giving a practical way to distinguish among different cosmologies , as recently investigated in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    in this paper , we study the general properties of galaxy clusters in different dark energy cosmologies .",
    "galaxy clusters are the largest virialized objects in the universe and are considered to be a fair sample of the overall matter distribution of the universe itself .",
    "they contain a large amount of gas in the form of diffused ionized plasma known as intracluster medium ( icm ) , which emits in the x - ray band .",
    "the x - ray properties of galaxy clusters such as luminosity and temperature trace the total mass of the cluster itself , and hence can be used to study global properties of these objects . a lot of observational work ( chandra , xmm - newton ) has been made in recent years , and future missions ( _ e.g. _ ixo , erosita , wfxt ) are under study to improve the characterization of these objects in the x - rays . the properties of galaxy clusters , in particular their mass ,",
    "can be investigated also in the optical region of the spectrum through gravitational lensing , which gives independent estimates from x - rays .    in this paper , we analyse the properties of simulated galaxy clusters in cosmologies with different dark energy models .",
    "we follow the formation and evolution of structures in hydrodynamical simulations of a cosmological box of size @xmath3 for five different cosmologies .",
    "these cosmologies are in general characterized by the presence of a dynamical dark energy component , _",
    "i.e. _ a dark energy component with density and equation of state evolving with time , and they will be introduced and discussed in detail in sect .",
    "[ models ] . after presenting the selection and composition of the sample we extract from the simulations",
    ", we will study the mass function at different redshifts .",
    "different dark energy models have a different cmb normalization of the spectrum of the perturbations and a different growth factor , both things affecting the mass function of galaxy clusters",
    ". then we will study the x - ray luminosity and temperature functions , because both quantities are a proxy for the cluster mass and can therefore be used to search for dark energy imprints . in this case",
    "the advantage is that these quantities are somehow directly observable with space facilities , while evaluating the mass of a galaxy cluster requires the assumption of a model or physical hypotheses ( such as hydrodynamical equilibrium ) that can introduce systematics ( for example if the cluster is not in a relaxed state ) , as shown in @xcite .",
    "we will also examine the x - ray luminosity - temperature ( @xmath7 ) relation of our sample , in order to check whether there is any clear discrepancy between the properties of the simulated objects in comparison with the observed ones .",
    "after the analysis of the global properties of the simulated sample , we will concentrate on the internal properties of the single clusters and study the relative distribution of the different mass components .",
    "in particular we will check the dark energy dependence of the baryon fraction @xmath8 .",
    "the study of the baryon fraction in galaxy clusters , either in the form of icm or of stars in galaxies , is useful to understand the formation history and the properties of these objects . combined with other independent information , such as for example the value of the baryonic density @xmath9 derived from primordial nucleosynthesis , @xmath8 can be used to derive the value of the matter density of the universe , @xmath10 .",

    "we have used natural units and set @xmath19 . the first term in equation ( [ friedmann ] )",
    "includes densities associated to each constituent of the universe while the second term accounts for any possible deviation from flat geometry .",
    "we can assume that the universe is constituted of three different components : matter [ baryons and cold dark matter ( cdm ) ] , for which @xmath20 ; radiation ( photons plus relativistic matter ) with @xmath21 , whose contribution is nowadays negligible ; dynamical dark energy ( de ) , which , in the simplest case , behaves as a fluid with negative time dependent @xmath22 and provides the present accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "we consider flat cosmological models for which @xmath23 , so the curvature term in the friedmann equation will be equal to zero . with this in mind , and introducing @xmath24 , we can express equation ( [ friedmann ] ) as    @xmath25    for our analysis we have considered three possible sets of cosmological models .",
    "the first is the standard @xmath0cdm model , that we use as a reference model , where dark energy is represented by the cosmological constant .",
    "this model is in agreement with present observations , though theoretically it is intrinsically affected by fine - tuning and coincidence problems . alternatively",
    ", dark energy could be a dynamical component , seen as a scalar field rolling down a potential @xcite .",
    "if the scalar field is minimally coupled to gravity , this class of scenarios is still affected by fine - tuning and coincidence problems , as much as in the standard @xmath0cdm model .",
    "however it is interesting , for our analysis , to consider such dynamical cases , where a time varying equation of state is present .",
    "numerical simulations of quintessential cold dark matter have been presented , for example , in @xcite .",
    "more interestingly , the dynamical scalar field could be coupled to other species , as addressed in , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we limit ourselves to the case in which the coupling involves universally all species , as it happens in scalar - tensor theories @xcite .",
    "the latter have been also investigated within @xmath26 theories in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xmath27-body simulations with a coupling to gravity ( extended quintessence ) have been studied , for example , in @xcite .",
    "note that hydro - simulations including a coupling to dark matter have been presented in @xcite .",
    "@xmath27-body simulations for coupled dark energy have been investigated in @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "the effect of scalar field perturbations was also taken into account .",
    "further fifth force couplings have been simulated in @xcite .",
    "the impact of early dark energy in structure formation has been considered in @xcite .",
    "our analysis differs from previous works because of different dynamics in the dark energy models considered and of the contemporary inclusion of baryonic physics in the framework of evolving dark energy scenarios .",
    "we will now specify in more detail the cosmologies here considered and our choice of the parameters .",
    "the first model considered is the concordance @xmath0cdm model , with the values of the cosmological parameters taken from wmap3 ( see subsect .",

    "the second case that we consider here is that of a dynamical dark energy , given by a quintessence scalar field @xmath32 with an equation of state @xmath33 @xcite . in general",

    "the conserved energy density and pressure of the quintessence scalar field that appear in equation ( [ continuity ] ) are defined as    @xmath39    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the potential in which the scalar field @xmath32 rolls .",
    "similarly , the evolution of the quintessence scalar field @xmath32 is given by the klein - gordon equation , obtained from equation ( [ continuity ] ) substituting equations ( [ rho_oq ] ) and ( [ p_oq ] ) ,    @xmath42    we note from equations ( [ rho_oq ] ) and ( [ p_oq ] ) that when the kinetic term @xmath43 is negligible with respect to the potential term @xmath41 , then @xmath44 and the @xmath0cdm case is recovered .    in this paper ,",
    "as potentials for minimally coupled quintessence models , we consider an inverse power law potential    @xmath45    the so called rp potential @xcite , as well as its generalization suggested by supergravity arguments @xcite , known as sugra potential , given by    @xmath46    where in both cases @xmath47 and @xmath48 are free parameters .",
    "it is well possible that the quintessence scalar field might interact with other species .",
    "here we consider the case in which @xmath32 interacts non - minimally with gravity @xcite and we refer in particular to the extended quintessence ( eq ) models described in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",

    "here we assume for the sake of simplicity a standard form for the kinetic part , @xmath54 , and we define the coupling function as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is chosen to be    @xmath57    here @xmath58 , where @xmath59 represents the `` bare '' gravitational constant @xcite , which is in general different from the newtonian constant @xmath60 and is set in such a way that locally @xmath61 in order to match local constraints on general relativity .",

    "however , it has been noted that such constraints may not apply at cosmological scales @xcite where complementary bounds , obtained combining wmap1 and 2df large scale structure data , provide the less tight limit of @xmath68 at @xmath69% confidence level @xcite .    in eq models",

    "we only recall for convenience that eq models behave like minimally coupled quintessence theories in which , however , a time dependent effective gravitational interaction is present . in particular , in the newtonian limit , the euler equation for cdm can be written as    @xmath77    in terms of the cosmic time , where we have redefined the gravitational parameter as    @xmath78 } { [ 2 f+3(\\partial f/\\partial \\phi)^2 ] } \\frac{1}{8 \\pi f } \\ .\\ ] ]    the latter formalism is general for any choice of @xmath56 .",

    "so we can refer to a single cosmology ( _ e.g. _ @xmath0cdm ) in order to study the mass dependence of these quantities .",

    "we do not consider different mass ranges , since at this redshift the cluster abundance starts to be low and all the objects have @xmath117 .",
    "again , the cosmologies are completely equivalent within error bars .    here",
    "we stress again that our simulations do not follow agn feedback .",
    "it is known from literature ( _ e.g_. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the effect of this feedback is mass dependent , leading to a lowering in the baryon fraction in groups and low - mass clusters , without affecting significantly high - mass clusters .",
    "we find in general a constant baryon fraction with respect to the mass .",
    "some authors ( _ e.g_. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) claim that in observed objects the total baryon fraction shows an increase with increasing mass .",
    "this difference with respect to our results could be due to the fact that some relevant physical processes are still not included in our cosmological simulations .",
    "such processes may be able to affect the global properties of low - mass systems without changing the high - mass clusters . not including them in the simulations does not permit to us to fully compare our results with observations .",
    "in particular , we note an overabundance of stars ( which obviously influences the total baryon fraction ) in low - mass objects .",
    "combining the right and left panels of fig .",
    "[ mass_dependence ] , we can study the evolution with redshift of @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",

    "a decrease of the baryon fraction with decreasing redshift was already found in other simulations ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and a possible explanation is that at high redshift the radius at which the baryons accrete is smaller than at low redshift , and so a greater number of baryons can fall in the cluster potential well .    finally , we study the star , gas , and baryon depletion parameters as a function of the distance from the centre of the cluster , defined as the position of the most bound particle . for each cosmology",
    "we select , as in sect .",
    "[ lt ] , the ten most massive ( in @xmath126 ) relaxed halos and generate the radial profile of the object obtained by stacking them .",
    "we do this at @xmath108 , @xmath127 and @xmath122 .",
    "we recall that , at @xmath122 , for sugra we only have six objects .",
    "the resulting profiles , expressed in units of the cosmic baryon fraction @xmath128 , are shown in fig .",
    "[ radius_dependence ] . at @xmath108 , in the outer regions near @xmath107 , the five cosmologies are completely equivalent , with @xmath104 having almost the cosmological value , while looking toward the centre some differences can be seen .",
    "this fact means that , as a whole , evolved relaxed clusters contain the same amount of baryonic matter , independently of the underlying cosmological model , but that the matter can be redistributed inside them according to their formation history .",
    "this fact is confirmed by looking at @xmath127 and in particular at @xmath122 , where the differences among the models are clear even in the outer regions , indicating a sort of self - regulating mechanism that leads to the same objects at @xmath108 even if they can be very different at higher redshifts .",
    "again , the same features appear both in the mean values of the whole sample and in more relaxed and massive objects , indicating that the latter are a fair representation of the clusters in a given cosmological model .    as a general rule for the radial profiles ,",
    "it is confirmed the well known relative trend of the radial profile of gas and stars components , being the former increasing with radius and the latter decreasing , giving a total baryon fraction almost constant ( but slightly decreasing ) beyond @xmath129 .",
    "then we note that the total baryon fraction at @xmath122 is higher compared to @xmath108 , in particular in the inner regions of clusters .",
    "the effect is mainly due to a higher star fraction in the inner regions of clusters at @xmath122 .",
    "another quite evident feature is that the radius at which the gas starts to dominate over the stars increases with increasing redshift .",
    "the explanation is that , as we have just seen , the gas fraction profile is almost independent of redshift , while the star fraction at a given radius increases with redshift , and so at higher redshift it remains the dominant baryonic component also at larger radii .",
    "in this paper we have analysed the general properties of a sample of galaxy clusters extracted from hydrodynamical simulations of different cosmological models with dynamical dark energy .",
    "we simulate a cosmological box of size @xmath3 , resolved with @xmath130 dark matter particles and the same amount of gas particles .",
    "the reference cosmology is a concordance @xmath0cdm model normalized to wmap3 data .",
    "the others are two quintessence models , one with a rp and the other with a sugra potential , and two extended quintessence models , with a positive and a negative coupling between quintessence and gravity , indicated as eqp and eqn , respectively .",
    "since all models are normalized to cmb data , they have different @xmath1 , and thus different structure formation histories .",
    "we focus on various properties of the considered objects , in particular the mass function , the x - ray @xmath7 relation , the x - ray luminosity and temperature functions ( xlf and xtf respectively ) and finally the baryonic fraction in terms of the depletion parameters @xmath106 , @xmath105 and @xmath104 defined in equation ( [ depletion ] ) .",
    "we select and study objects at three different redshifts , @xmath108 , @xmath127 , and @xmath122 , with @xmath131 .",
    "we also define a criterion to distinguish between relaxed and unrelaxed clusters . from our analysis",
    "we draw the following conclusions .",
    "* mass function : at @xmath108 the total mass function evaluated at @xmath132 shows different behaviours in the different cosmologies , in particular in the normalization .",
    "the @xmath0cdm model tends to form more clusters of a given mass with compared to the other cosmologies ; sugra is the cosmology with the smallest abundance , while rp , eqp and eqn lie in between , with rp and eqp being the closest to @xmath0cdm .",
    "this fact directly reflects the redshift evolution of the equation of state parameter @xmath92 and of the growth factor , given the different assumed value of @xmath1 in the various models .",
    "actually , for extended quintessence models , a positive value of the coupling leads to an higher linear density contrast , and vice versa for a negative coupling .",
    "this would imply a higher mass function for models with negative coupling ( _ i.e. _ eqn ) than for models with positive coupling ( _ i.e. _ eqp ) , keeping fixed all remaining parameters . in our case , this effect is somehow mitigated by the different @xmath1 used .",
    "this trend is preserved also at @xmath127 and @xmath122 .",
    "the differences among the models are more pronounced in the high - mass tail of the distribution .",
    "this is expected , because very massive objects form later and are representative of the different structure formation time scale of the considered cosmologies .",
    "we note here that our results are different from what has been found in the case of coupling with dark matter @xcite , where there is an enhancement in the number counts of massive objects . *",
    "@xmath7 relation : we compare the @xmath7 relation of our simulated objects in the @xmath0cdm reference models with a collection of observed objects . despite the differences in the slope of the relation in the two cases ( @xmath133 for our simulated objects vs @xmath134 for their observed ones )",
    ", we find that there is a good agreement in the high - temperature high - luminosity region where x - ray selected observed objects are found .",
    "the discrepancy in the low - temperature low - luminosity region is not worrying , because low - mass systems are globally more affected by physical mechanisms not yet fully understood and reproduced ( _ e.g_. * ? ? ? * ) , acting in the core .",
    "we also study the evolution with redshift of the @xmath7 relation for the ten most massive relaxed objects in each cosmology , both keeping and cutting the core .",
    "we find that cutting the core results in both a lower mean luminosity and lower mean emission - weighted temperature .",
    "in general , both the mean luminosity and temperature increase with decreasing redshift , independently of the cosmological model , because they trace the hierarchical growth of structures .",
    "* x - ray observable functions : the relative behaviour observed in the mass functions is also qualitatively reproduced by the xlfs and xtfs evaluated in the [ @xmath135 kev band in the [ @xmath136@xmath119 region , with few exceptions .",
    "in particular , in the range of luminosity around @xmath137 rp tends to form @xmath124% more clusters than @xmath0cdm .",
    "we also check the x - ray @xmath138 and @xmath139 functions as proxies for the mass function .",
    "we conclude that all the x - ray observable functions are more or less equivalent , with @xmath140 and @xmath138 being slightly more stable than @xmath141 and @xmath139 , in tracing the mass function and thus disentangle the growth of structures among different dark energy models . for each dark energy model",
    "we evaluate the volumes that a cluster survey must cover in order to be able to distinguish it from the concordance @xmath0cdm model , using the mass function , the xlf , and the xtf .",
    "* baryon fraction : the analysis of the @xmath106 , @xmath105 , and @xmath104 dependence on mass , redshift and distance from the cluster centre shows that there is no significant difference among the five cosmologies considered , if we limit ourselves to the values at @xmath107 and at @xmath108 .",
    "therefore , at these conditions , @xmath104 ( and so the baryon fraction @xmath8 ) can be safely used as a cosmological proxy to derive the value of other cosmological parameters .",
    "in addition , we do not find any clear positive trend of the total baryon fraction with mass , while we see a positive trend ( of the order of @xmath120% ) of the gas fraction and a negative trend ( of the order of @xmath142 ) of the star fraction going from low - mass to high - mass systems .",
    "considering observations of real objects , in spite of finding the same trend for the gas and star fraction as we do , other authors ( _ e.g_. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) claim that the total baryon fraction is increasing with increasing mass .",
    "actually , for all the cosmological models here considered , we find a slight decrease in the total baryon fraction with increasing mass .",
    "still , we have to recall that , despite the hydrodynamical treatments in the simulations is based on sophisticated physical models , we do not include agn feedback in our simulations .",
    "it is known from literature ( see _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",

    "the net effect is the lowering of the total baryon fraction in low - mass objects while not affecting more massive clusters . finally , we find a slight decrease ( at most @xmath120% ) of the baryon fraction going from high to low redshift .",
    "a similar trend was already noted by @xcite and a possible explanation is that at high redshift the radius at which the baryons accrete is smaller than at low redshift , and so a greater number of baryons can fall in the cluster potential well .    in the end",

    "<S> we investigate the influence of dark energy on structure formation , within five different cosmological models , namely a concordance @xmath0cdm model , two models with dynamical dark energy , viewed as a quintessence scalar field ( using a rp and a sugra potential form ) and two extended quintessence models ( eqp and eqn ) where the quintessence scalar field interacts non - minimally with gravity ( scalar - tensor theories ) . </S>",
    "<S> we adopted for all models the normalization of the matter power spectrum @xmath1 to match the cmb data . in the models with dynamical dark energy and quintessence </S>",

    "<S> the contemporary presence of evolving dark energy and baryon physics allows us to investigate the interplay between the different background cosmology and the evolution of the luminous matter . </S>",
    "<S> since cluster baryon fraction can be used to constrain other cosmological parameters such as @xmath4 , we also analyse how dark energy influences the baryon content of galaxy clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , in models with dynamical dark energy , the evolving cosmological background leads to different star formation rates and different formation histories of galaxy clusters , but the baryon physics is not affected in a relevant way . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate several proxies for the cluster mass function based on x - ray observables like temperature , luminosity , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the x - ray temperature and @xmath5 functions are better diagnostic to disentangle the growth of structures among different dark energy models . </S>",
    "<S> we also evaluate the cosmological volumes needed to distinguish the dark energy models here investigated using the cluster number counts ( in terms of the mass function and the x - ray luminosity and temperature functions ) . </S>",
    "<S> relaxed , massive clusters , when studied in regions sufficiently far from from the centre , are built up in a very similar way despite the different dark energy models here considered . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that the overall baryon fraction is almost independent of the dark energy models at a few percent level . </S>",
