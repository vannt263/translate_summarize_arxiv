    "a library of far - infrared and sub - mm images of nearby galaxies is currently being collated and more insight into the physics and distribution of interstellar dust in nearby galaxies can be expected with the great improvements in spectral coverage , sensitivity and spatial resolution .",
    "extinction measures of dust have some specific advantages over emission : they do not depend on the dust temperature , allowing for the detection of much colder dusty structures , and typically have the high resolution of the optical imaging observations .",
    "the single drawback is that one needs a known background light source . in the case of the transparency of spiral galaxies , two techniques",
    "have just such a proven background source : background galaxies counts and occulting galaxy pairs .",
    "the technique that uses the number of background galaxies @xcite is nearing obsolescence as its inherent resolution and accuracy , limited by the intrinsic cosmic variance of background sources , are now surpassed by the accuracy and sensitivity of _ herschel space observatory _ observations of dust surface density in nearby galaxies .",
    "the occulting galaxies technique , however , has increased steadily in accuracy and usefulness , owing in a large part to the increasing sample sizes . estimating dust extinction and mass from differential photometry in occulting pairs of galaxies was first proposed by @xcite .",
    "their technique was then applied to all known pairs using ground - based optical images @xcite and spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "subsequently , some pairs were imaged with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these initial results , however , were limited by sample sizes ( @xmath0 pairs ) .",
    "more recently , new pairs were found in the sdss spectroscopic catalogue ( 86 pairs in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and through the galaxyzoo project @xcite : 1993 pairs reported in @xcite .",
    "this wealth of new pairs provided opportunities for follow - up with ifu observations @xcite and galex @xcite .",
    "a greatly expanded occulting galaxy catalog improves accuracy as  ideal pairs \"  an elliptical partially occulted by a late - type galaxy can be selected for follow - up .",
    "ellipticals are the optimal background source as their light profile is smooth and very symmetric .",
    "results from the occulting galaxy pairs include : ( 1 ) a mean extinction profile @xcite , ( 2 ) an indication that the dust may be fractal @xcite and ( 3 ) the observation that the colour - extinction relation is grey , i.e. there is little or no relation between the reddening of the stellar populations and total extinction .",
    "the latter is due to the coarse physical sampling of ground - based observations .",
    "the galactic extinction law returns as soon as the physical sampling of the overlap region resolves the molecular clouds in the foreground disk ( @xmath1 pc * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    a very reliable way to identify occulting galaxy pairs , i.e. , purely serendipitous overlaps of galaxies is through blended spectra . in @xcite",
    ", we used the rejects from the strong lenses with acs survey ( slacs * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , a highly successful search for strong lenses , confirmed with hst @xcite , with spectroscopic selection extended now to the boss survey @xcite .",
    "both types of blended spectral sources have two things in common : very close association on the sky ( within a sdss spectroscopic fibre of 3  diameter ) and clear spectroscopic signal from both galaxies at distinct redshifts .    in this paper",
    ", we present the blended spectra catalogue based on the galaxy and mass assembly ( gama ) survey @xcite as candidates for either strong lensing follow - up or occulting galaxy analysis ( e.g. , hst imaging or spectroscopy ) .",
    "the gama data is an improvement over sdss as the target galaxies can be fainter , the aperture is smaller ( i.e. , a closer overlap of the galaxies ) and the autoz detection algorithm is a marked improvement on the sdss detections .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : ",
    "[ s : gama ] briefly introduces the gama survey ,  [ s : selection ] the redshift determination and selection of blended spectra ,  [ s : vis ] presents the visual classifications of the blended objects ,  [ s : cat ] presents the blended spectra catalogue and we discuss the pair classification and their possible future uses in ",
    "[ s : disc ] .",
    "the gama survey has obtained over 250000 galaxy redshifts selected to @xmath2mag over 290 deg@xmath3 of sky @xcite . at the heart of this survey",
    "is the redshift survey with the upgraded 2df spectrograph aaomega @xcite on the anglo - australian telescope .",
    "the gama survey extends over three equatorial survey regions of 60 deg@xmath3 each ( called g09 , g12 and g15 ) and two southern regions of similar area ( g02 , g23 ) .",
    "see @xcite for a detailed description of the gama input catalogueue for the equatorial regions .",
    "the redshift survey in combination with a wealth of imaging data has led to many science results already .",
    "we use for this work the gama  ii redshifts @xcite , which were obtained using a robust cross - correlation method for spectra with and without strong emission lines @xcite .",
    "galaxy redshifts were initially determined by a supervised fit @xcite but a recent upgrade to the gama survey pipeline includes a fully - automated template - based redshift determination ( autoz , * ? ? ? * ) . in certain cases ,",
    "the fits for different templates resulted in two high - fidelity , but different redshifts ; these are the candidate blended objects of interest to us here .",
    "the autoz code obtains cross - correlation redshifts against stellar and galaxy templates with varying strength of emission and absorption line features .",
    "the height and position of the first four peaks of normalized cross - correlation functions are obtained .",
    "these are called @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 each with a corresponding redshift and template number , with the peaks separated by at least 600km / s .",
    "high values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , particularly relative to @xmath6 and @xmath7 , can then be used to select candidate blended spectra .",
    "the autoz algorithm marks a significant improvement in the identification of blended spectra over that which could be obtained from gama  i redshifts . in the initial redshift campaign ,",
    "`` redshifters ''  the gama team members identifying the redshift with runz  were focused on attaining a reliable redshift for single objects .",
    "in such an approach , only those spectra with wildly different redshifts by two redshifters or spectra remarked upon during visual inspection would be selected . with autoz , blended spectra",
    "are identified as different redshifts using normalized cross - correlation functions , a much more objective and complete approach .",
    "double redshift selection using the autoz approach was to require that two different redshifts had high cross - correlation peaks ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) , while the next two redshifts had significantly lower peak values . in order to address this",
    ", we defined the ratio between the second redshift peak value and subsequent , third and fourth , redshift peaks to be : @xmath8 to select the double - z candidates , we required @xmath9 ( to avoid aliasing and a clean selection of real blends , see figures [ f : double - z ] and [ f : z - z - plot ] ) and for the first two redshifts to be from galaxy spectral templates .",
    "the galaxy spectral templates used in autoz were from sdss .",
    "an early version of the code used the sdss dr2 templates , while a later version used templates derived from the @xcite galaxy eigenspectra .",
    "these later templates were numbered 40 - 47 in order of increasing emission - line strength . to broadly classify the templates , we select templates 40 - 42 as ` passive galaxies ' ( pg ) and 43 - 47 as ` emission - line galaxies ' ( elg ) .    initially , we selected candidates with @xmath10 and @xmath11 , with these values determined using the early version of the code .",
    "after the code was updated , the value of @xmath12 changed as a result of the new templates and a modest increase in the allowed redshift range from 0.8 to 0.9 . using the new values , we selected candidates with @xmath10 and with no restriction on @xmath5 .",
    "old candidates were retained subject to a couple of criteria : the new value of @xmath12 was still greater than 1.35 , and @xmath13 was not near a problematic cross - correlation alias .",
    "aliases can result from the matching of different emission lines in the templates to a strong line in the data .",
    "all candidates , old and new , near the alias of @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) or the inverse were removed from the sample .",
    "figure  [ f : double - z ] shows the distribution of candidates in @xmath5 versus @xmath12 , i.e.  the selection parameters .",
    "figure  [ f : z - z - plot ] shows where the aliases lie , in @xmath16 versus @xmath17 , with respect to the candidates .       versus @xmath17 : for all gama spectra with @xmath19 and @xmath18 shown with black points , and for the selected candidates ( @xmath9 ) shown with red squares .",
    "most candidates lie away from the alias lines that are appear parallel when plotting the logarithm of one plus redshift on each axis.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the selection resulted in  galaxy pair candidates ( from 299 blended spectra  some source locations were observed more than once ) . depending on which template matched best for both redshifts in the blend , we classified the type of blends as follows : two passive - template galaxies ( pg+pg ) , two emission - line templates ( elg+elg ) , a passive template at low redshift and emission line template at higher redshift ( pg+elg ) , or vice versa ( elg+pg ) .",
    "table [ t : spectype ] summarizes the resulting classifications .",
    "the autoz results for our blended objects are listed in table [ t : cat ] ."
