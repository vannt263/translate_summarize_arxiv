    "over the past decade , mixtures formed by two bosonic species have raised a considerable interest @xcite-@xcite due to the theoretic prediction of new exotic quantum phases .",
    "such phases , determined by the competition of the interspecies interaction with the onsite interactions and tunneling amplitudes of each species , include , for example , unprecedented mott - like states and types of superfluidity @xcite-@xcite , and composite states exhibiting coexistence of different phases @xcite .",
    "mixtures , realized by means of either two atomic species @xcite or the same species in two different internal states @xcite , have been trapped in optical lattices formed by many potential wells and are efficiently described in the bose - hubbard ( bh ) model framework @xcite .",
    "their recent in - lab achievement has made stronger the interest for these systems .",
    "the simplest but not trivial optical device where condensates of different atomic species can be loaded is the trap formed by a double - well potential .",
    "this has been realized by albiez and co - workers @xcite in 2005 by superposing a parabolic trap with a ( sinusoidal ) linear potential .",
    "this system has been widely explored within the mean - field approach to analyze the atomic counterpart of the josephson effect in superconductor - oxide - superconductor junctions @xcite , the dynamical stability of binary mixtures @xcite , different types of self - trapping solutions @xcite , the effectiveness of the space - mode description within the gross - pitaevskii picture @xcite and the rabi - josephson regime @xcite .",
    "further work has shown how the double - well system with two species can be exploited to model the dynamics of spin - orbit - coupled condensates @xcite , to investigate their quantum evolution in the raman - coupling regime @xcite and energy - spectrum properties @xcite . for several reasons ,",
    "a fully - quantum analysis of few - well systems deserves a treatment too .",
    "first , because in the presence of sufficiently - low boson numbers only a bh - like formulation in terms of second - quantized space modes can provide a realistic description of microscopic processes in mixtures at essentially zero temperature .",
    "second , because even the relatively simple models consisting of a mixture trapped in two wells feature complex dynamical behaviors owing to the strong nonlinearity of the interaction terms .",
    "this character affects , not only high - energy but also weakly - excited states including the ground state .",
    "then , at very low temperatures , it is interesting to revisit nonlinear behaviors , first explored classically , in a fully - quantum environment . finally , various well - established methods , both numerical and theoretical , seem to be applicable to study quantum models describing a mixture in two wells . despite such circumstances ,",
    "a rather small attention has been focused on quantum aspects of these systems @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this work aims to explore the low - energy properties of a two - species condensate confined in a double - well potential .",
    "the model describing this mixture is therefore a two - species bose - hubbard hamiltonian defined on a two - site lattice ( dimer ) that , in addition to single - component interwell tunneling and onsite boson - boson interactions , also incorporates the density - density interaction @xmath0 between atoms of different species . for brevity",
    "we call this model the two - species dimer ( tsd ) .",
    "the first aspect we consider is the numerical diagonalization of the tsd hamiltonian in the zero - temperature regime .",
    "we find that , by keeping fixed the intraspecies interaction @xmath3 , variations of interspecies interaction @xmath0 produce significant changes in the structure of the ground state . on the repulsive side , increasing @xmath0 drives the ground state from the uniform state ( delocalization regime with mixed species ) to a symmetric superposition of states exhibiting a macroscopic space separation ( demixing ) of the two species , passing through an intermediate configuration where the delocalized state and the symmetric demixed state coexist .",
    "when the interspecies interaction is attractive , instead , the uniform ground state  evolves \" to a configuration in which atoms of different components tend to macroscopically populate the same well ( localization regime with mixed species ) .",
    "studying appropriate extensions to the present case of the fisher information @xcite , the coherence visibility @xmath4 @xcite and the entanglement entropy @xmath5 @xcite in terms of interaction @xmath0 allows us to characterize the ground state from the correlations point of view .",
    "in particular , we find that the maxima of @xmath4 and @xmath5 correspond to the on - set of a ground state in which a delocalized component and two symmetric localized states coexist .",
    "these numerical results improve our insight on how the ground - state structure depends on @xmath0 .",
    "the information obtained from the numerical determination of the ground - state configurations is then used to approach analytically the investigation of the low - energy regimes within the bogoliubov approximation . in this framework",
    "we diagonalize the tsd hamiltonian , in the strong - interaction ( @xmath6 ) and in the weak - interaction ( @xmath7 ) regime , by identifying weakly - occupied modes in the space - mode picture and in the momentum - mode picture , respectively .",
    "we reconstruct the low - energy spectrum , comparing the latter with the numerical eigenspectrum , and provide an approximate form of weakly - excited states . the demixing condition written in terms of the model parameters",
    "is derived analytically .",
    "we shed light on the spectral collapse occurring when the localization - delocalization transition of the species takes place , which causes the change of the energy spectrum from a discrete form to an almost continuous one @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the corresponding change of the algebraic structure of the hamiltonian is also discussed .",
    "we consider two interacting bosonic gases ( denoted below by @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) at zero temperature .",
    "each species is confined in a three - dimensional trapping potential @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) achieved by superimposing an isotropic harmonic confinement in the transverse radial ( @xmath12-@xmath13 ) plane and a symmetric double - well @xmath14 potential in the axial direction @xmath15 .",
    "the resulting potential is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the boson mass of the @xmath18th component , @xmath19 the trapping frequency in the radial plane felt by the species @xmath18 , and quantities @xmath20 , @xmath21 are assumed to be sufficiently small . due to the strong radial harmonic confinement",
    "we treat the system as quasi - one - dimensional .",
    "moreover , if the energy per particle in the axial direction is much smaller than the transverse level spacing @xmath22 , then bosons can be assumed to stay in the ground state of the transverse harmonic oscillator .",
    "the model describing this system can be derived from the bosonic - field hamiltonian by implementing the space - mode approximation ( see , for example , @xcite ) . by expanding the field operators in the basis of the single - particle wave functions localized in each well",
    ", one achieves the two - species bh hamiltonian @xmath23 with @xmath24 -j_c \\big(\\hat{c}_{l}^{\\dagger}\\hat{c}_{r}+\\hat{c}_{r}^{\\dagger}\\hat{c}_{l } \\big ) , \\ ] ] and @xmath25 the operator @xmath26 annihilates a boson of species @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) in the @xmath27th well ( @xmath28 , with @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) representing the left ( right ) well ) , @xmath31 is the amplitude of the intraspecies onsite interaction , @xmath32 is the tunneling amplitude , and @xmath0 is the interspecies interaction amplitude between bosons in the same well .",
    "boson operators @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , in addition to @xmath37 = \\delta_{uv}= [ b_v , b^\\dagger_u]$ ] with @xmath38 , satisfy the commutators @xmath39=0 $ ] , and @xmath40=0 $ ]",
    ". for each species , the total boson numbers @xmath41 commute with @xmath42 implying that @xmath43 and @xmath44 are conserved quantities . to further simplify the model we assume species @xmath8 and @xmath9 with the same mass , the same intraspecies s - wave scattering length , and experiencing identical double - well and harmonic confinements . in the following , we thus set @xmath45 and @xmath46 , that is , the components @xmath8 and @xmath9 have the same hopping parameter and intraspecies interaction .",
    "we shall relax such assumptions whenever is possible .",
    "we solve the eigenvalue equation associated to hamiltonian ( [ bhtwo ] ) @xmath47 for fixed numbers @xmath48 and @xmath49 of bosons of species @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively . in this case",
    "the hamiltonian can be represented by a @xmath50 matrix with @xmath51 in the basis @xmath52 with @xmath53 $ ] and @xmath54 $ ] . for each eigenvalue @xmath55 , with @xmath56 , the corresponding eigenstate @xmath57 has the form @xmath58 where we assume without loss of generality that the coefficients @xmath59 are real . in the ket @xmath60 , @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) is the number of bosons of species @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) in the left well , while in @xmath63 , @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) is the number of bosons of species @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) in the right well .",
    "since we focus our attention on the ground state ( @xmath66 ) , we simplify the notation by setting @xmath67 . when both the intra- and the interspecies interactions are zero , the ground state of hamiltonian ( [ bhtwo ] ) is given by the product of two atomic ( or su(2 ) ) coherent states ( see , e. g. , @xcite , @xcite ) @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the state with no bosons .",
    "coherent states of this form usually describe the superfluid phase for large @xmath70 where bosons are uniformly distributed on the lattice and thus totally delocalized .    if one assumes that the intraspecies interactions @xmath71 , @xmath72 are essentially negligible with respect to the ( absolute value of the ) interspecies interaction @xmath73 , the ground state of the tsd hamiltonian is essentially formed by a symmetric superposition of two states with macroscopically populated wells .",
    "its form depends on the sign of @xmath0 . in particular , for @xmath1 ( repulsive interspecies interaction ) , the ground state has the form @xmath74 whereas for @xmath2 ( attractive interspecies interaction ) the ground state is @xmath75 in figs .",
    "[ fig1n ] , [ fig2n ] and [ fig3n ] , we show the ground state of hamiltonian ( [ bhtwo ] ) when @xmath0 is varied .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1n ] represents the ground state when boson - boson interactions are zero , namely , @xmath76 .",
    "this situation corresponds to the atomic coherent state ( [ coherentdouble ] ) .",
    "as shown in the right panel of the same figure for which @xmath77 and @xmath78 , the distribution @xmath79 becomes narrower as soon as the on - site repulsive interaction is switched on .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     c",
    "we have studied a bosonic binary mixture confined by a one - dimensional double - well potential ( tsd model ) where each atomic species is described by a bh model and the two species are coupled via an onsite density - density interaction @xmath0 .",
    "we have investigated the system by adopting two different approaches and analyzed the ground state by varying @xmath0 in both the repulsive ( @xmath1 ) and the attractive ( @xmath2 ) case .",
    "first , we have diagonalized numerically the tsd model and obtained an exact description of the ground - state structure . then",
    ", we have characterized the tsd lowest energy state from the viewpoint of correlation properties . in this respect ,",
    "we have studied ( the appropriate specializations to the case under study of ) the quantum fisher information , the coherence visibility and the entanglement entropy as functions of @xmath0 , showing their sensitivity to the changes of the ground - state structure .    as a second , after identifying the weakly - occupied bosonic modes in the four regimes characterized by @xmath0 ( interspecies interaction ) and @xmath31 ( onsite interaction of species @xmath11 ) , we have reconstructed within the bogoliubov approach the energy spectrum and the relevant low - energy states .",
    "the low - energy part of the spectrum displays an excellent agreement with the spectrum calculated numerically .",
    "this agreement is shown to improve when the total boson number @xmath80 is increased .",
    "finally , we have shown how moving from the delocalized regime to the localized one where both species feature macroscopic components , separated ( @xmath1 ) or mixed ( @xmath2) determines a spectral collapse in which the interlevel distance became smaller and smaller when @xmath81 approaches @xmath82 from below . the eigenstates , exhibiting squeezed - state components for @xmath83 , assume a form characterized by glauber - state components for @xmath84 , reflecting the new algebraic structure of the hamiltonian in this regime .",
    "the authors acknowledge the ministero dellistruzione , universit e ricerca , ( miur ) for the support provided by the grant prin 2010llkjbx .",
    "within the bogoliubov scheme , operators @xmath87 , @xmath88 can be seen as complex parameters if @xmath89 and @xmath90 . with the substitutions @xmath91 , @xmath92",
    "( in which the phase factors associated to @xmath87 and @xmath88 can be removed due to the u(1 ) symmetry of the hamiltonian ) model ( [ bhtwo ] ) reduces to @xmath93 where the terms depending on @xmath48 , @xmath49 are grouped in the constant @xmath94 and third - order ( or higher - order ) terms have been neglected .",
    "we focus our attention on the special case @xmath95 in which the technicalities of the diagonalization scheme are not excessive and the ground - state properties are easily evidenced .",
    "the general case @xmath96 will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "the diagonalization process is effected in two steps .",
    "first , by exploiting the unitary transformation @xmath97 with @xmath98 , which generates the mode transformations @xmath99 for @xmath100 such that @xmath101 ( obtained by requiring that the term coupling modes @xmath4 and @xmath102 vanishes in the new hamiltonian ) , these transformations supply the mode - decoupled formula @xmath103 , whose explicit expression is @xmath104 in which @xmath105 we have tacitly assumed @xmath106 in @xmath107 . note that , if @xmath108 , the angle @xmath100 will be negative and the definitions of @xmath109 , @xmath110 simply exchange with each other .",
    "the second step follows from the observation that the two subhamiltonians for modes @xmath4 and @xmath102 are linear combinations of the generators of the two algebras su(1,1 ) @xmath111 @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 where @xmath115 .",
    "then they can be reduced to the diagonal form ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) by using the simple su(1,1)-group transformations @xmath116 $ ] having the typical form of a squeezing operator .",
    "the diagonal hamiltonian is given by @xmath117 with @xmath118 $ ] , @xmath119 $ ] , when the angles @xmath120 and @xmath121 are assumed to satisfy the condition @xmath122 with @xmath123 .",
    "due to @xmath125 and @xmath126 , the bogoliubov approximation reduces @xmath127 to the effective hamiltonian involving modes @xmath128 and @xmath129 @xmath130 with @xmath131 the opposite case @xmath132 and @xmath133 leads to the effective hamiltonian @xmath134 the eigenstates ( [ estate2 ] ) of @xmath135 include states @xmath136 @xmath137 and @xmath138@xmath139 representing generalized glauber coherent states .",
    "the two unitary transformations ( taking @xmath85 into the diagonal form ) @xmath140 where @xmath141 represent displacement operators of the weyl - heisenberg groups associated to modes @xmath142 and @xmath143 . here ,",
    "the notation introduced in equation ( [ superposition ] ) for a generic fock state @xmath144 has been replaced by the more effective fully - factorized one : @xmath145 where @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "similar to eigenstates ( [ estate2 ] ) , the states associated to eigenvalues ( [ eigenvalueswgu2 ] ) @xmath150 with @xmath151 , @xmath152 , include two generalized glauber coherent states defined by @xmath153 @xmath154 and @xmath155 @xmath156 where @xmath157 s represent displacement operators .    concerning the generalized glauber state defined by @xmath158 , it is worth recalling that their distinctive feature consists in providing the minimum - uncertainty relation @xmath159 , where the canonical operators @xmath160 and @xmath161 are related to the boson mode @xmath162",
    ", @xmath163 is a number - operator state , and @xmath164 .",
