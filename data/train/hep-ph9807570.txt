    "multi - jet final states play an important role in the study of high - energy collisions .",
    "they provide in fact interesting signatures for several phenomena , both within the standard model ( e.g. top - pair production ) , and beyond it ( e.g. multi - jet decays of supersymmetric particles such as gluinos and squarks ) .",
    "the accurate determination of the properties of these phenomena requires a good understanding of the properties of the usually large multi - jet qcd backgrounds , which can distort the shapes of signal distributions and affect the measurement of quantities such as resonances masses . in the past few years",
    ", several theoretical developments have allowed the calculation of very complicated multi - parton processes in qcd ( for a review , see  @xcite )  s and jets . ] .",
    "for example , the complete set of leading - order ( lo ) background processes to the production and decay of top - quark pairs in hadronic collisions is known for both the fully hadronic decays  @xcite , and the @xmath6 + 4-jet decays  @xcite .    while significant progress has been made in the field of one - loop corrections ( for a review see  @xcite ) , quantitative studies of multi - jet processes ( with @xmath7 ) can only be done today using tree - level results , which are the subject of the present work .",
    "there are several reasons for wanting to improve the tools currently available to perform these calculations .    1 .",
    "first of all , interesting final states with larger jet multiplicities will become available with the next generation of colliders ( lhc and nlc ) .",
    "this will hold both for standard qcd processes , where the huge available phase - space will allow production of many high-@xmath8 jets , and for potential signals of new physics ( a good example being cascade decays of heavy squarks or gluinos with @xmath9-parity non - conservation , where final states with over 10 jets would be a typical signature ) .",
    "this calls for improved algorithms , to allow the calculation of cross - sections for complicated processes within reasonable amounts of computer time . 2 .",
    "secondly , one would like to be able to complement the calculation of parton - level matrix elements with the evaluation of the full hadronic structure of the final state .",
    "this is a key ingredient for a satisfactory study of both signal and background components and for a complete comparison between theory and data .",
    "it involves the consistent merging of the matrix - element computation with the parton - shower evolution , a problem which has not been considered in the development of previous tools for the evaluation of multi - jet processes .",
    "while relations are known  @xcite which allow to systematically evaluate high - order tree - level processes in a recursive fashion , the complexity of the algorithm grows very quickly and makes progress beyond the processes listed above very hard .",
    "several approximations have therefore been introduced  @xcite , to evaluate with rather low computing time and acceptable accuracy cross - sections for many partons in the final state .",
    "nevertheless , the knowledge of the exact parton level matrix elements will always be needed , in order to assess the reliability of the approximations used .    in this work we present an approach to the calculation of tree - level matrix elements for multi - parton final states which addresses both of the above problems , and",
    "therefore improves on the currently available algorithms .",
    "the key element of this proposal is the use of the algorithm alpha , developed by two of us  @xcite for the evaluation of arbitrary multi - parton matrix elements .",
    "this algorithm determines the matrix elements from a ( numerical ) legendre transform of the effective action , using a recursive procedure which does not make explicit use of feynman diagrams .",
    "the algorithm has a complexity growing like a power in the number of particles , compared to the factorial - like growth that one expects from naive diagram counting .",
    "this is a necessary feature of any attempt to evaluate matrix elements for processes with large numbers of external particles , since the number of feynman diagrams grows very quickly beyond any reasonable value .",
    "for example , the number of tree - level feynamn diagrams corresponding to a process with @xmath10 gluons and @xmath11 pairs of quarks ( with @xmath12 ) , is given by the following formula : , where @xmath13 is the number of 3-gluon vertices , @xmath14 is the total number of external quark legs and internal quark propagators , and @xmath15 is the total number of gluonic external legs and internal propagators .",
    "the number of diagrams obtained by attaching an additional gluon in all allowed ways is given by : @xmath13 diagrams of type @xmath16 , plus @xmath14 diagrams of type @xmath17 plus @xmath15 diagrams of type @xmath18 .",
    "these triplets can be obtained by applying the operator @xmath19 to the function @xmath20 .",
    "their multiplicities are given by the coefficients of the relative monomials , and the total number of generated diagrams is extracted by setting @xmath21 in the polynomial thus obtained .",
    "repeated iteration of this operator on the three - point diagrams @xmath22 and @xmath23 , represented by the monomials @xmath24 and @xmath25 , gives the desired result .",
    "] [ oper ] n_diag = _ x = y = z=1 a similar formula can be constructed for processes with more than 1 quark pair .",
    "the number of diagrams relevant for some of the examples considered in this paper are collected in table  1 .        ' '' ''    process & @xmath26 & @xmath27 & @xmath28 & @xmath29 +    ' '' ''    @xmath30 & 559,405 & 10,525,900 & 224,449,225 & 5,348,843,500 +    ' '' ''",

    "alpha has been shown to operate very successfully in the case of purely electroweak processes  @xcite , and will be reviewed here in section  2 .",
    "its application to the case of qcd , although straightforward , requires some care due to the rapid increase of the number of colour configurations with the number of external coloured particles .",
    "furthermore , the choice of how to organise the sum over colour structures has important implications for the possibility to merge the evaluation of a given matrix element with the successive parton - shower qcd evolution .",
    "several options are available , in principle , to deal with the summation over all possible colour configurations .",
    "they will be discussed in section  3 , where our strategy for an efficient generation of monte - carlo events , combined with the possibility to generate colour configurations suitable for a parton - shower evolution , will be presented .",
    "some numerical examples of applications of this tecnique to the case of @xmath32 parton processes in hadronic collisions are given in section  4 .",
    "a more complete study , including the treatment of associated production of jets and electroweak gauge bosons and the description of a complete event generator interfaced to a parton - shower program such as herwig  @xcite , will be presented in the future .",
    "independently of our efforts , work by draggiotis , kleiss and papadopoulos  @xcite has recently addressed the problem of the efficient generation of multi - parton qcd final states using the alpha algorithm . in this work",
    "they turn the summation over colours into an integration over a continuous set of variables , slightly gaining in computational accuracy over the more standard colour - summation technique presented in our work . the integration technique ,",
    "however , does not lend itself in an obvious way to the efficient merging of the parton - level calculation with the parton - shower evolution . in either case , it is quite clear that improvements in the numerical efficiency of these calculations will be possible , and work should be devoted in the future to find the best compromise among all different requirements to be met for a faithful and efficient representation of these highly complex processes .",
    "in reference @xcite , a new approach to the computation of tree level scattering amplitudes was introduced .",
    "this approach , based on the numerical legendre transform of the effective action , is particularly useful for the automatic calculation of multi - particle processes .",
    "this technique was implemented in a fortran code @xcite which has been succesfully used to study several intricated electroweak processes @xcite . for the sake of completeness , we review in this section the alpha algorithm ; the interested reader can find a more detailed discussion in the original paper @xcite , which includes an explicit analytic example for the @xmath33 theory .",
    "let @xmath34 be the one - particle - irreducible generator of the green functions for a given theory .",
    "then the computation of the s - matrix requires the evaluation of the legendre transform , z , of @xmath34 : z(j^)= - ( ^ ) + j^(x)^(x ) [ legtr ] where @xmath35 are the classical fields defined as the solutions of j^= , [ minim ] and the @xmath36 play the role of classical sources . in general",
    "the lagrangian contains several fields , with different spin and internal quantum numbers .",

    "we can thus compute the scattering amplitude for any physical initial and final states .",
    "in particular , any colour structure can be assigned to the external legs ( while for example the berends - giele s recursive relations  @xcite have only been derived for colour - ordered amplitudes ) and weak bosons ( as well as other particles beyond the standard model ) can be incorporated .",

    "in fact the pure yang - mills lagrangian @xmath84 can be rewritten as @xmath85 this form of the lagrangian has the virtue that a single interaction term of the form @xmath86 is left , instead of the two interaction terms which are present in eq .",
    "( [ ym ] ) .",
    "this saves cpu time when performing the iteration step given in eq .",
    "( [ algorithm ] ) . a further reduction in the algorithm complexity",
    "can be obtained by using the coulomb gauge @xmath87 , which reduces the number of components of the field @xmath88 from four to three and those of the field @xmath89 from six to three .",
    "the proper bookkeeping of the colour structure of qcd processes has been one of the main ingredients in the simplification of the calculations of multi - parton processes in qcd which took place in the past years .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that by expanding the matrix element for a given qcd process in a particular colour basis , the coefficients of each colour structure in this basis enjoy important properties which make their calculation much simpler .",
    "as an example , the scattering amplitude for @xmath3 gluons with momenta @xmath90 , helicities @xmath91 and colours @xmath92 ( with @xmath93 ) , can be written as : [ eq : dualg ] m(\\{p_i},\\{_i},\\{a_i } ) = _ p(2,3,  ,n ) ( ^a_1^a_2  ^a_n ) a(1,2, ",
    "the sum extends over all permutations @xmath94 of @xmath95 , and the functions @xmath96 ( known as _ dual _ or _ colour - ordered _ amplitudes ) are gauge - invariant , cyclically - symmetric functions of the gluons momenta and helicities , as opposed to using the full symbols @xmath97 and @xmath98 , to specify the relevant permutation of momenta and helicities . ] .",
    "all of the colour - dependence is absorbed in the trace coefficients , and the dual amplitudes are colour - independent . in these special bases",
    "some particular helicity amplitudes  @xcite have very simple analitical expressions  @xcite , regardless of the number of external partons , and all amplitudes obey recursive relations  @xcite which make it possible to numerically evaluate them systematically for arbitrarily complex processes  @xcite .",
    "thanks to additional properties of these functions , only @xmath99 of them are truly independent , and the remaining ones can be obtained from specific _ linear _ combinations  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , when summing over colours the amplitude squared , different orderings of dual amplitudes are orthogonal at the leading order in @xmath100 : [ eq : dualgsq ] _ col s m(\\{p_i},\\{_i},\\{a_i } ) ^2 = n^n-2(n^2 - 1 ) _ p(2,3, ",
    "it is therefore possible to achieve an accuracy to leading - order in @xmath100 by neglecting the evaluation of the subleading interferences , reducing significantly the complexity of the numerical evaluations .",
    "similar expansions hold for processes involving one  @xcite or more  @xcite quark pairs . in the case of amplitudes with one quark pair , for example ,",
    "one has the following expansion : [ eq : dualq ] m(q_,|q_,\\{p_i},\\{_i},\\{a_i } ) = _ p(1,2,  ,n ) ( ^a_1^a_2  ^a_n ) _ a(q,|q,1,2,  ,n ) where the gauge - invariant functions @xmath101 obey remarkable properties similar to those of the gluonic amplitudes .",
    "dual amplitudes can be easily evaluated using the alpha algorithm . since the dual amplitudes @xmath102",
    "are independent of the number of colours , they can be calculated exactly by taking @xmath103 sufficiently large .",
    "considering for example the case of an @xmath3-gluon amplitude , we can choose @xmath104 and select the following set of @xmath105 matrices to represent the gluon colours @xmath106 : [ eq : lambdajk ] ( ^a_i ) _ jk = _ i , j _",
    "i+1,k ( i=1,  ,n-1 ) , ( ^a_n ) _ jk = _ n , j _ k,1 with this colour choice",

    "we explicitly calculated multi - gluon dual amplitudes using the large-@xmath103 colour - matrices given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambdajk ] ) .",
    "we verified the correctness of the calculation for @xmath3 up to 11 by comparing the results for maximally helicity violating ( mhv ) amplitudes  @xcite ( e.g. @xmath108 ) with the analytic expressions known exactly for arbitrary @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "the input of the numerical evaluation of the matrix element is a string containing the total number of gluons , their helicity state , and their momenta . from these data ,",
    "the amplitude is evaluated automatically . since the evaluation performed with the alpha algorithm does not treat the case of mhv amplitudes differently than any other helicity combination , and since we checked the numerical calculation using several different gauges ( which allowed us to ensure that no accidental cancellation of individual diagrams takes place ) , we are confident that our code correctly evaluates the dual amplitudes for arbitrary helicity configurations .",
    "we extended this test to processes with one and two @xmath109 pairs , where analytic expressions are known for similar mhv amplitudes  @xcite , and found perfect agreement .",
    "the use of dual amplitudes for the evaluation of multi - parton processes has one valuable feature , and one serious drawback .",
    "the valuable feature is the fact that dual amplitudes admit a simple physical interpretation , which as we shall show makes them the required starting point for the parton - shower evolution of the parton - level process .",
    "the serious drawback is that their number grows factorially with @xmath3 , so that while each individual dual amplitude can be easily and quickly calculated , using the technique given above , the number of dual - amplitude calculations which are necessary to get the full matrix element squared and summed over colours becomes soon too large to be practical . in the rest of this section",
    "we will first explain in more detail the role of dual amplitudes for the parton - shower evolution of the hard process , and then present a way to bypass the rapid growth of their multiplicity .",
    "dual amplitudes correspond to planar amplitudes in the @xmath110 limit of qcd . at large @xmath103 ,",
    "the colour structure given by the assignement in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambdajk ] ) corresponds to having the colour flowing from gluon 1 to gluon 2 , from gluon 2 to gluon 3 , and so on , until the colour of the last gluon flows back to gluon 1 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the identification of a specific colour flow makes it possible to incorporate soft - gluon emission corrections to the hard process .",
    "in fact the soft - gluon emission probability from a planar amplitude is given , in the large-@xmath103 limit , by the incoherent sum over the emission probabilities from each individual colour - string  @xcite .",
    "in the case of a multi - gluon amplitude , for example , we get : _",
    "col s m(p_1 ,  , p_n ,",
    "k ) ^2 g^2 n _ p(1,2, ",
    ",n ) _ i=1, ",
    ",n a(1,2 ,  , n ) ^2 + o(1/n^2 ) , where @xmath111 and @xmath112 are identified in the above equation .",
    "inclusion of soft - gluon virtual corrections factorises in a similar fashion , and sudakov form factors for the soft - gluon emission probability can be defined , to next - to - leading logarithmic accuracy , to describe the parton - shower evolution from any such colour - ordered process  @xcite .",
    "perfectly similar equations can be written in the case of processes involving quark pairs .",
    "the prescription to correctly generate the parton - shower associated to a given event in the large-@xmath103 limit is therefore the following :    1 .",
    "calculate the @xmath113 dual amplitudes corresponding to all possible planar colour configurations .",
    "extract the _ most likely _ colour configuration for this event on a statistical basis , according to the relative contribution of the single configurations to the total event weight   for each colour flow @xmath114 , and @xmath115 , the @xmath116-th colour structure will be selected if @xmath117 , for a random number @xmath118 uniformly distributed over the interval @xmath119 $ ] . ] .",
    "since each dual amplitude is gauge invariant , the choice of colour - configurations is also a gauge - invariant operation .",
    "3 .   develop the parton shower out of each initial and final - state parton , starting from the selected colour configuration .",
    "this step can be carried out by feeding the generated event to a monte - carlo program such as herwig , which is precisely designed to _",
    "turn partons into jets _ starting from an assigned colour - ordered configuration .",
    "notice that , if the dual amplitudes are evaluated for a specific helicity configuration , herwig will also include spin - correlation effects in the evolution of the parton shower  @xcite .    with the physical value of @xmath120",
    ", dual amplitudes corresponding to different permutations will however interfere with each other , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dualgsq ] ) .",
    "this interference is suppressed by powers of @xmath100  @xcite , as well as by dynamical factors : for example , the behaviour of interference terms is less singular near collinear or soft momentum configurations than the leading terms in @xmath103 . within the @xmath100 approximation which is employed in the description of coherence effects in the shower evolution  @xcite , it is therefore consistent to neglect the interferences between different dual amplitudes for the selection of the colour structure to be assigned to a given event . after calculating the total weight of a given event , accurate to all orders in @xmath121",
    ", we can thus still use the procedure described in point 2 above to assign a definite colour configuration to the event itself .    as a result , use of the dual - amplitude representation of a multi - gluon amplitude allows to accurately describe not only the large - angle correlations in multi - jet final states , but also the full shower evolution of the initial- and final - state partons with the same accuracy available in herwig for the description of 2-jet final states .    in the @xmath110 limit",
    "the choice of the dual amplitude basis has also one important advantage . since interferences between different colour structures vanish in this limit , one can perform the sum over colours by monte - carlo methods . rather than evaluating the full matrix element squared , summed over all colour structures , one can randomly select a dual colour structure on an event - by - event basis , and just evaluate the corresponding contribution to the amplitude squared . an overall multiplicative coefficient proportional to the number of dual colour configurations provides the correct normalization . assuming that , on average , all colour configurations contribute the same amount to the cross - section , this approach is numerically more efficient than summing each event over all colours .",
    "furthermore , one could optimise the selection of colour configurations , to adapt it to possible differences in their individual overall contributions .",
    "this is similar to what is usually done to perform the sum over quark and gluon helicities .    at finite @xmath103",
    "this procedure is not applicable anymore , as interferences between various colour structures do not vanish . at the same time , the matrix describing all possible colour interferences has a size growing like @xmath122 ^ 2 $ ] , which makes its storing and access highly inefficient .",
    "we propose to solve this problem as follows .",
    "first of all we choose the following orthonormal basis for the gell - mann @xmath105 matrices : & & ^1 = (    ccc 0 & 1 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 0    ) , ^2 = (    ccc 0 & 0 & 1 + 0 & 0 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 0    ) , ^3 = (    ccc 0 & 0 & 0 + 1 & 0 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 0    ) + & & ^5 = (    ccc 0 & 0 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 1 + 0 & 0 & 0    ) , ^6 = (    ccc 0 & 0 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 0 + 1 & 0 & 0    ) , ^7 = (    ccc 0 & 0 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 0 + 0 & 1 & 0    ) + & & ^4 = (    ccc 1 & 0 & 0 + 0 & -1 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 0    ) , ^8 = (    ccc 1 & 0 & 0 + 0 & 1 & 0 + 0 & 0 & -2    ) in this basis , only a fraction of all possible @xmath123 colour assignements gives rise to a non - zero amplitude . for each event , we randomly select a non - vanishing colour assignement for the exernal gluons , and evaluate the amplitude @xmath124 .",
    "the weight of the event is proportional to @xmath125 , multiplied by the number of non - zero colour configurations .",
    "this is all we need if we are not interested in evolving the event with the parton shower . if instead we want to generate the parton shower , we first decide , with standard unweighting techniques , whether to accept the event . if the event is accepted , we list all dual amplitudes contributing to the chosen colour configuration according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : dualg ] ) and , among these dual amplitudes , we randomly select a colour flow on the basis of their relative weight and @xmath126 processes ( for @xmath127 ) with the known results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , as implemented in the njets code  @xcite .",
    "the agreement is at the level of machine precision . ] .    in a 6-gluon amplitude , for example ,",
    "a possible non - zero colour assignement is given by @xmath128 .",
    "up to cyclic permutations , only three orderings of the colour indices give rise to non - vanishing traces : @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "therefore only three dual amplitudes contribute to the full amplitude : @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "the colour ordering to be specified for the coherent parton - shower evolution can be selected by comparing the size of the squares of @xmath135 for the three contributing permutations @xmath136 of the colour indices .",
    "since the average number of dual amplitudes involved in the evaluation of a single element of the orthogonal basis is smaller than @xmath113 , the complexity of the procedure grows more slowly than for the calculation done using directly the dual basis .",
    "the distribution of the number of dual amplitudes contributing to all possible colour assignements in the orthogonal basis for @xmath137 and 10 gluons is shown in fig .",
    "2 . furthermore , considering that only unweighted events are usually evolved by the parton shower , and that unweighted events are a small fraction of all generated parton - level events , the decomposition in terms of dual amplitudes only needs to be performed for a small fraction of the generated configurations .",
    "the results we present in the following are all relative to parton - level results , and therefore only the monte - carlo summation over orthogonal colour configurations is considered .",
    "as an example of our technique , we present here results for the following two parton - level processes : @xmath138 for comparisons , we also computed the above reactions in the simple approximation first suggested by kunszt and stirling  @xcite .",
    "this approximation ( hereafter referred to as sphel ) consists in assuming that the average value of mhv amplitudes is equal to the average value of all other non - zero amplitudes . in the case of @xmath3-gluon",
    "amplitudes this amounts to estimating the sum over all helicity configurations using the relation : _ hel s | m ( gg ( n-2 ) g ) |^2= _ mhv m(gg ( n-2 ) g)|^2 where the sum on the right - hand side runs over all mhv amplitues ( e.g. @xmath139 , @xmath140 , etc . ) .",
    "their value is known exactly for all @xmath3 at the leading - order in @xmath121  @xcite : _ mhv m(gg ( n-2 ) g)|^2 = 4 ( ) ^n-2 ( n^2 - 1 ) _",
    "i , j ( p_i p_j)^4 + [ eq : pt ] _",
    "p(1,n-1 ) where the sum runs over all permutations @xmath141 of the indices @xmath142 . similarly ,",
    "in the case of @xmath143 amplitudes , the sphel approximation amounts to assuming : _ hel s m(q |q g ) ^2 = _ mhv m(q    amplitues ( e.g. @xmath140 ) , whose value is known exactly for all @xmath3 at the leading - order in @xmath121  @xcite : _ mhv m(q |q g ) | = 4 ( ) ^n ( n^2 - 1 ) _ i=1,n + [ eq : mp ] _ p(1, ",
    ",n ) , where the sum runs over all permutations @xmath144 of the indices @xmath145 .    the kinematic configuration and the cut values used in our numerical examples are as follows : @xmath146 these values , and the choice of a fixed strong coupling @xmath147 , only serve for illustrative purposes .",
    "a more complete phenomenological analysis of production cross - sections and a comparison of exact and approximate expressions will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the integration over the phase space allowed by the cuts was performed by monte carlo using both rambo  @xcite , a flat phase space generator , and a multichannel approach  @xcite .",
    "both integration strategies gave compatible and comparable efficiencies .",
    "the sum over helicity configurations was performed via a flat monte carlo generation .",
    "no attempt has been made to optimise this step .",
    "some of the details of the numerical performance of the algorithm are given at the end of the section .    in table  2",
    "we present our monte carlo estimate for the partonic cross - sections , together with the values obtained by using sphel .",
    "sphel overestimates by about a factor 2 the exact cross - section for the process @xmath148 , while it is accurate at the 10% level for @xmath149 .        ' '' ''    process & exact ( pb ) & sphel ( pb ) +    ' '' ''    @xmath150 & 0.719 @xmath151 0.019 & 1.53 @xmath151",
    "0.03 +    ' '' ''    @xmath152 & ( 0.901 @xmath151 0.009)@xmath153 & ( 1.042 @xmath151 0.008)@xmath153 +    notice the large ratio of the @xmath154-initiated amplitude , relative to the @xmath155 one . in the case of @xmath156 processes ,",
    "this ratio is of order 30 for a reference scattering angle @xmath157 , while here it is much larger .",
    "it is easy to understand this result considering the structure of the mhv amplitudes in the two cases . in the gluon - only case , eq .",
    "( [ eq : pt ] ) , the numerators are dominated by the term @xmath158 , while in the @xmath159 case , eq .  ( [ eq : mp ] ) ,",
    "only terms proportional to @xmath52-channel momentum exchange appear . with the increase in the number of final - state particles , the average momentum exchanged in the @xmath52-channels",
    "becomes smaller , while @xmath160 stays the same , and the ratio @xmath161 becomes very large .",
    "we also considered differential cross - sections . in fig .  3",
    ", we show the distribution of the minimum gluon transverse momentum for both processes . a good agreement between the exact and the sphel result",
    "is observed .",
    "considering the large uncertainties present in the overall normalization of multi - parton tree - level processes ( e.g. those induced by changes in the choice of the renormalization and factorization scales ) , the approximated evaluation can provide in many cases a sufficient description of the final - state distributions .    in figs . 4 and 5 we plot the distributions for the maximum gluon transverse momentum and the maximum two - gluon invariant mass",
    "again there is a reasonable agreement between the exact and the approximated result , in particular in the case of the gluon - only process .    before closing this section , we present some technical details to illustrate the performance of the algorithms used to produce our results . as an example , consider the process @xmath162 . as shown in table  1 , the total number of feynman diagrams contributing to this process is 10,525,900 .",
    "the plots in this work have been obtained from the evaluation of the matrix elements for @xmath163 monte carlo points passing the selection cuts given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cuts ] ) ( out of @xmath164 points selected by the phase - space generator ) . the efficiency for the generation of the non zero weights , defined as the average weight divided by the maximum weight , was about @xmath165 .",
    "the computational time for producing 100 events that pass the cuts , with a 200 mhz processor  , and working in double precision throughout , was about 91 seconds for the exact matrix element and 2.3 seconds using the sphel approximation . in this last case ,",
    "the dominant component of the cpu budget is the search for phase - space configurations passing the selection cuts .",
    "we presented in this work an algorithm to evaluate the exact , tree - level matrix elements for multi - parton processes in qcd .",
    "this technique , based on the algorithm alpha , has been tested for processes such as @xmath1 gluons and @xmath2 gluons , with @xmath3 up to 9 .",
    "we discussed how the summation over colour configurations allows the construction of parton - level event generators suitable to interfacing with a parton - shower evolution including the effects of colour - coherence .",
    "this will eventually lead to a fully exclusive , hadron - level description of multi - jet final states , accurately incorporating the dynamics of large jet - jet separation angles .",
    "while we confined our presentation to the case of hadroproduction , our program can be used without modifications for the evaluation of multi - parton production in @xmath166 collisions , since the relevant @xmath167 lagrangian is already included in the code . likewise , associated hadroproduction of gauge bosons and qcd partons is a straightforward application of our code .",
    "we gave some explicit numerical results , considering parton - level cross - sections and distributions for the processes @xmath168 gluons and @xmath169 gluons .",
    "we verified that some standard simple approximations to the multi - parton cross - sections provide a good description of the exact result , for both rates and distributions .",
    "the existence of the exact results allows now to extend the checks on these approximations to values of @xmath3 larger than ever before .",
    "we expect that large improvements can be obtained in the numerical efficiency of the algorithm , and that cross - sections for up to 10 final - state partons should become feasible .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath3 becomes so large that the evaluation of the exact amplitudes is numerically too slow for the generation of large samples of events , one can nevertheless use the approximated calculations to generate the samples , and lower statistics runs to assess the goodness of the approximation . in this respect ,",
    "the numerical efficiency of the phase - space generation in presence of kinematic cuts will need to be improved as well .",
