    "after the first successful space flight use of the x - ray charge coupled device ( ccd ) of the sis ( @xcite ) on board asca , the ccd has been playing a major role in imaging spectroscopy in the field of x - ray astronomy . however , the charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) of x - ray ccds increases in orbit due to the radiation damage ; the cti is defined as the fraction of electrons that are not successfully moved from one ccd pixel to the next during the readout . since the amount of charge loss depends on the number of the transfers , the energy scale of x - ray ccds depends on the location of an x - ray event .",
    "furthermore , there is a fluctuation in the amount of the lost charge .",
    "therefore , without any correction , the energy resolution of x - ray ccds in orbit gradually degrades . in the case of the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis )",
    "@xcite on board the suzaku satellite  @xcite launched on july 10 , 2005 , the energy resolution in full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) at 5.9  kev was @xmath0140 ev in august 2005 , but had degraded to @xmath0230 ev in december 2006 .",
    "the increase of the cti is due to an increase in the number of charge traps at defects in the lattice structure of silicon made by the radiation .",
    "since the trap distribution is not uniform , it would be best if we could measure the cti of each pixel as chandra acis  @xcite . in the case of the xis , however , it is impossible to measure the cti values of all the pixels , mainly because the onboard calibration sources do not cover the entire field of view of the xis",
    ". therefore , we use the cti of each column to correct the positional dependence of the energy scale .",
    "the xis is equipped with a charge injection structure  @xcite which can inject an arbitrary amount of charge in arbitrary positions . using this capability",
    ", we can precisely measure the cti of each column  @xcite . by applying the column - to - column cti correction ,",
    "the positional dependence of the cti corrected energy scale is greatly reduced , and the over - all energy resolution is also improved  @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "the results of the cti correction was mainly based on the ground - based charge injection experiments .",
    "in - orbit measurements were limited within one year after the launch . this paper reports more comprehensive and extended in - orbit experiments up to two years after the launch .",
    "the results are based on the data with the normal full window mode @xcite without a spaced - row charge injection @xcite , and have been implemented to the suzaku calibration database and applied to all the data obtained with the same mode .",
    "all the errors are at the 1@xmath1 confidence level throughout this paper unless mentioned .",
    "the xis is the set of four x - ray ccd camera systems .",
    "three sensors ( xis  0 , 2 , and 3 ) contain front - illuminated ( fi ) ccds and the other ( xis  1 ) contains back illuminated ( bi ) ccd .",
    "the xis  2 sensor became unusable on november 9 , 2006 .",
    "therefore there are no data for xis  2 after that day .",
    "the detailed structure of the ccd has been provided in @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we define a `` row '' and a `` column '' as a ccd line along the @xmath2 and @xmath3 axes , respectively ( see figure  3 in @xcite ) . in the imaging area , the _ actx _ value runs 0 to 1023 from the segment a to d , while the _ acty _ value runs from 0 to 1023 from the readout node to the charge injection structure .",
    "the charge injection structure lies adjacent to the top row ( _ acty _",
    "= 1023 ) in the imaging area .",
    "we can inject charges from @xmath0 50 e@xmath4 to @xmath0 4000 e@xmath4 per pixel ; the equivalent x - ray energy ranges from @xmath00.2  kev to @xmath015  kev .",
    "a charge packet generated by an incident x - ray is transferred to the readout node , then is converted to a pulse - height value .",
    "we define @xmath5 to be the original pulse height generated by the x - ray . in the real case ,",
    "the readout pulse height of the packet ( @xmath6 ) is smaller than @xmath5 , because some amount of charges is lost during the transfer . to measure the charge loss",
    ", we have to know both @xmath5 and @xmath7 .",
    "however , we can usually measure only @xmath6 , and hence it is difficult to obtain @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite reported a technique to solve this problem by the charge injection method , and @xcite applied this technique to the xis .",
    "we briefly repeat by referring figure  3 in @xcite .",
    "first , we inject a `` test '' charge packet into the top ccd row ( _ acty _",
    "then , after the gap of a few rows , five continuous packets are injected with the same amount of charge of the test packet .",
    "the former four packets are called `` sacrificial '' charge packets , while the last one is called a `` reference '' charge packet .",
    "the test packet loses its charge by the charge traps . on the other hand",
    ", the reference packet does not suffer from the charge loss , because the traps are already filled by the preceding sacrificial packets .",
    "thus we can measure the charge loss by comparing the pulse - height values of the reference charge ( @xmath8 ) and the test charge ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the relation between sacrificial charge packets and reference charge packets is described in gendreau ( 1995 ) .",
    "we can obtain a checker flag pattern by these injected packets in the x - ray image ( right panel of figure  3 in @xcite ) because of the onboard event - detection algorithm  @xcite . therefore in this paper , we call this technique a `` checker flag charge injection ( cfci ) . ''",
    "a charge packet in the xis loses its charge during ( a ) the fast transfer ( 24  @xmath10s  pixel@xmath11 ) along the _ acty _ axis in the imaging area , ( b ) the fast transfer along the _ acty _ axis in the frame - store region , ( c ) the slow transfer ( 6.7  ms  pixel@xmath11 ) along the _ acty _ axis in the frame - store region , ( d ) the fast transfer to the readout node along the _ actx _ axis .",
    "the cti depends on many parameters such as the transfer speed and the number density of the charge traps  @xcite .",
    "the frame - store region is covered by the shield and is not exposed to the radiation directly .",
    "furthermore , the pixel size of the frame - store region ( 21  @xmath10m@xmath1213.5  @xmath10 m ) is different from that of the imaging area ( 24  @xmath10m@xmath1224  @xmath10 m ) .",
    "thus the number of traps per pixel may be different between the imaging area and the frame - store region .",
    "then we assumed that the four transfers have different cti values .",
    "we examined the transfer ( d ) by using the calibration source data taken in april 2007 , and found no significant decrease of the pulse height along the _ actx _ axis .",
    "we , therefore , ignore the charge loss in the transfer ( d ) .",
    "we define that @xmath13 is the transfer number in the imaging area ( @xmath13=@xmath3 + 1 ; here , @xmath3 is a coordinate value where an incident x - ray generates a charge packet ) .",
    "then the relation between @xmath6 and @xmath5 is expressed as , @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the cti values in the transfers ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) , respectively .",
    "here we used the fact that the cti values are much smaller than 1 .",
    "thus we can separate the charge loss into @xmath13-dependent component ( the second term in the right - hand side of equation  [ eq : cti_def_0 ] ) and constant component ( the third term ) .",
    "we therefore substitute the cti with cti1 ( the former component ) and cti2 ( the latter component ) , which have the cti values of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively",
    ". then equation  [ eq : cti_def_0 ] can be written as @xmath20    since the cti values depend on the amount of transfer charge which is proportional to the pulse height , we assume the cti is described by a power function of the pulse height ( prigozhin et al .",
    "2004 ) and expressed as @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are scale factors for the cti1 and cti2 , and the index @xmath24 is common to the cti1 and cti2 .",
    "we have conducted the cfci experiments six times in orbit . effective exposure time for",
    "each experiment ranges from a few to @xmath020 ks .",
    "the equivalent x - ray energy of the injected charge packets ranges from @xmath00.3  kev to @xmath08  kev .",
    "since june 2006 , we injected various amounts of charge in one experiment .",
    "the log is summarized in table  1 .    in the cfci experiments ,",
    "the test charge is injected to the row at @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) , and hence @xmath27 .",
    "the reference charge should be equal to the original charge which does not suffer from the charge loss , and hence @xmath28 .",
    "then equation  [ eq : cti_def ] can be written as @xmath29    we determined @xmath30 by measuring the ratio @xmath31 for each column . from equation  3 , we can obtain the relation in the cfci experiments as , @xmath32 the index @xmath24 and @xmath33 were derived by fitting equation  [ eq : cfci_cti2 ] to the values of @xmath30 obtained with the cfci experiments with multiple amount of charge injections ( multiple @xmath8s ; log number 36 in table  1 ) .",
    "the mean and standard deviation of the best - fit @xmath24 of equation  [ eq : cfci_cti2 ] averaged over each sensor are shown in figure  [ fig : ctipow ] .",
    "the mean value of @xmath24 shows no time variation , and the time averaged values of xis  0 , 1 , and 3 are 0.31 , 0.22 , 0.15 for xis  0 , 1 , and 3 , respectively . as for xis  2",
    ", there was only one data point , and we obtained @xmath34 .",
    "if a charge packet has a volume proportional to the number of electrons and is spherically symmetric , the probability that one electron encounters a charge trap is proportional to the cross section of the charge packet . in this case",
    ", we can expect @xmath35 . from equation  [ eq : cfci_cti ] ,",
    "the cti value is proportional to @xmath36 , and hence @xmath37 .",
    "thus the simple model is roughly consistent with the observed @xmath24 values .",
    "using the results of all the cfci experiments ( log number 16 in table  1 ) and above determined @xmath24 values , we then re - estimated @xmath22 and @xmath23 separately . in this process",
    ", we assumed @xmath38 is equal to @xmath39 which was estimated by the 6.4  kev line from the sgr  c region to be 0.67 and 1.5 for the fi and bi ccd , respectively ( @xcite ) . from this @xmath22",
    ", we can obtain the final value of @xmath40 .",
    "figure  [ fig : baratuki ] shows an example of the distribution of @xmath40 in july 2006 .",
    "we can see significant column - to - column dispersion .",
    "figure  [ fig : ctihenka ] shows the change of @xmath40 from july 2006 to september 2007 .",
    "we can see that the cti values of all columns increased , but the increasing rate was different from column to column .",
    "the results of figures  2 and 3 indicate that the cti correction at the column level is strongly required . in figure",
    "[ fig : ctijikanhatten ] , we show the column - averaged @xmath40 value as a function of time .",
    "since the cfci experiments were only sparsely conducted ( see table  1 ) , we interpolate the @xmath40 and @xmath41 values for the observations of inter - cfci epochs . as for the determination of the cti values before the first cfci experiment ,",
    "see appendix .",
    "a cti correction , which is the conversion of @xmath42 to @xmath5 , is made with equation  [ eq : cti_def ] , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are calculated from equation  3 by using the @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 values determined in section  3 .",
    "we used the emission lines from the onboard calibration sources , the perseus cluster of galaxies , and the supernova remnant 1e0102.2@xmath437219 .",
    "we retrieved the data from the data archives and transmission system of isas / jaxa .",
    "all data were acquired with the normal full window mode and the 3@xmath123 or 5@xmath125 editing mode  @xcite .",
    "we used the data with the asca grades of 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 . as is mentioned in @xcite , a small fraction of the charge in a pixel",
    "is left behind ( trailed ) to the next pixel in the same column during the transfer .",
    "all data used in this paper were corrected for the trail phenomenon .",
    "the observations are summarized in table  [ tab : objlog ] .",
    "the calibration source @xmath44fe produces the mn k@xmath45 line .",
    "the theoretical line center energy is 5895  ev @xcite .",
    "we used the data from august 2005 to april 2007 .",
    "this is one of the x - ray brightest clusters of galaxies in the sky .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is that of a thin thermal plasma with the strong k@xmath45 line of fe .",
    "the plasma temperature changes smoothly from @xmath46 4  kev to @xmath0 7  kev toward the outer region  @xcite , and the center energy of the fe k@xmath45 triplet is almost constant ( @xmath06.56  kev at @xmath47 ) within this temperature range . its radius of @xmath48 can cover the entire field of view of the xis ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "thus this source is suitable for measuring the positional dependence of the energy scale .",
    "this is one of the brightest supernova remnants in the small magellanic cloud . with the spatial resolution of suzaku",
    ", it can be regarded as a point source .",
    "there are many bright emission lines originated from thermal plasma in the x - ray spectrum below 2  kev .",
    "these lines are resolved with the xmm - newton rgs , and the accurate energies of the line centroids are known  @xcite .",
    "this object has been used by many instruments for the calibration in the low - energy band , and an empirical model to describe the spectrum has been established .",
    "we used this source as the energy - scale calibrator in the low - energy band .",
    "for the data of the perseus cluster of galaxies , we divided the imaging area into four regions along the _ acty _ axis , and extracted a spectrum from each region .",
    "then we fitted the spectra in the 57.3  kev band with a power - law model and a gaussian function , and obtained the center pulse height of the fe k@xmath45 line .",
    "figure  [ fig : perseus ] shows the center pulse height as a function of @xmath13 . triangles and circles indicate the data before and after the cti correction , respectively",
    ". we can see no significant @xmath13 dependence after the cti correction , and this supports the validity of our correction .",
    "the goal is to determine a relation of @xmath5 and x - ray energy @xmath51 . from the ground experiments",
    ", we found that the @xmath5-@xmath51 relation can be expressed as a broken - linear function linked at the si - k edge energy of 1839  ev  @xcite .",
    "we then determined the @xmath5-@xmath51 relation of each segment by using the lines of the calibration sources ( mn k@xmath45 line at 5895  ev ) and 1e@xmath50 ( k@xmath45 lines of o , ne and ne around 6501020  ev ) .",
    "we show the results after the cti correction and the @xmath5-@xmath51 conversion .",
    "figure  [ fig : calpeak ] shows measured center energies of the mn k@xmath45 line as a function of time .",
    "each mark in the plot has an effective exposure of more than 60  ks .",
    "the mean values of the center energy are 5896.2 , 5895.4 , 5895.0 , and 5895.4  ev for xis  0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively .",
    "the deviation around the theoretical center energy ( 5895  ev ) is 7.8 , 4.4 , 6.6 , and 7.8  ev for xis  0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the time - averaged uncertainty of the absolute energy is @xmath52 0.1 % for the mn k@xmath45 line of the calibration sources .",
    "we also studied the time evolution of the deviation around the theoretical center energy , and the results are shown in figure  [ fig : peakbunsanhenka ] .",
    "we can see that the deviation gradually increases with time .",
    "figure  [ fig : sciofflowpeak ] shows the center energy of the o k@xmath45 line from the 1e@xmath50 data .",
    "the mean values of the center energy are 652.6 , 653.8 , 652.7 , and 652.8  ev for xis  0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively .",
    "the deviation around the center energy of the empirical model ( 653  ev ) is 1.4 , 1.4 , 2.3 , and 1.1  ev for xis  0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 .",
    "therefore , the uncertainty of the absolute energy is @xmath53 0.2% for the o k@xmath45 line of 1e@xmath50 .",
    "we examined the energy resolution in fwhm ( @xmath54 ) @xcite for each sensor ; @xmath54 is common to all segments .",
    "we expressed @xmath54 as @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are time dependent parameters and @xmath58 is the energy resolution determined by the ground experiments and obtained using equation  1 in @xcite .",
    "we determined @xmath56 and @xmath57 by using the time history of the calibration sources and 1e@xmath50 .",
    "the @xmath54 values obtained in this way is incorporated into the redistribution matrix file ( rmf ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : segcolumn ] shows the energy resolution of the mn k@xmath45 line after the column - to - column cti correction .",
    "we also plot the results of the cti correction , where we used the cti values averaged over a segment ( the column - averaged cti correction ) .",
    "we can see that the energy resolution is greatly improved by the column - to - column cti correction .",
    "for example , the energy resolution in december 2006 was greatly improved from @xmath0230  ev to @xmath0 190  ev . on the other hand , with the column - averaged cti correction ,",
    "the energy resolution is @xmath0230  ev and is not significantly improved . in figure",
    "[ fig : calsig ] , we compared the energy resolution of the mn k@xmath45 line with our rmf model .",
    "the deviation of the data points around our model is 5.6 , 4.9 , 3.4 , and 6.3  ev for xis  0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively .",
    "we have conducted the cfci experiments six times in orbit .",
    "the cti correction has been done with the cfci results .",
    "we calibrated the energy scale of the xis precisely using the onboard calibration sources and 1e@xmath50 .",
    "our calibration results have been applied to all the data obtained with the normal full window mode without the spaced - row charge injection .",
    "the results of the cfci experiments and the current calibration status are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we determined the cti1 and cti2 values of each column precisely based on the data of the cfci experiments .",
    "we also found that the pulse height dependence of the cti does not change with time .",
    "2 .   after the column - to - column cti correction , we determined the @xmath5-@xmath51 relation .",
    "we also modeled the time - dependent energy resolution .",
    "the uncertainty of the energy scale is @xmath59 0.2 % for the o k@xmath45 line ( @xmath0 0.65  kev ) of 1e@xmath50 , and @xmath59 0.1 % for the mn k@xmath45 line ( @xmath605.9  kev ) of the calibration sources .",
    "4 .   with the column - to - column cti correction , the energy resolution at 5.9  kev in december 2006",
