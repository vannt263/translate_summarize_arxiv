    "the unprecedent convergence of observational results that we are currently witnessing has narrowed down the region of the cosmological parameter space which is compatible with all the different and independent probes of cosmology : supernovae @xcite @xcite , cmb @xcite and large scale structures @xcite .",
    "robustly growing evidence suggests that _",
    "i ) _ ordinary matter is a minority ( @xmath0 ) of all the matter content of the universe , _ ii ) _ matter  mostly dark , non - baryonic matter  is a minority ( @xmath1 ) of all the cosmological mass  energy density , mostly contributed by an obscure form of energy referred to as ` dark energy ' , _ iii ) _ the 3d spatial geometry of the universe is flat and _ iv ) _ the expansion of the cosmic metric has been accelerating for the last @xmath2 gyrs of our universe lifetime .    even though the big picture is in place , the two dominant contributions to the stress - energy tensor  i.e. dark energy and dark matter ",
    "still have a hypothetical nature and they have not been discovered yet . while there is widespread evidence for the existence of the non - baryonic dark matter component producing the potential wells of large - scale structures @xcite , as yet no persuasive theoretical explanation has been able to elucidate the physical nature of the dark energy component @xcite . as a matter of fact , unveiling the nature of dark energy and its role in cosmology and gravitation is a difficult and subtle challenge . in such a context , it should not be overlooked that the large roaming from model to model , and the abundance of weakly predictive theories , might eventually limit the possibility of discriminating between different competitors proposed so far for explaining the observed dynamics of the accelerating universe .    in the absence of a compelling theoretical explanation for the dark energy component , and in a minimal , zero - order approach , we explore here the possibility of preserving the standard metric interpretation of the accelerated expansion against possible alternative physical scenarios . to this end ,",
    "we first evaluate and then discuss the observable consequences of local , non - gravitational mechanisms which could in principle accelerate matter in our hubble patch of the universe .",
    "we assume here that the universe is described by general relativity , that it is dominated by components which satisfy the usual energy conditions ( according to which the universe can only decelerate ) and that the onset of recent accelerated expansion is the result of the presence of a hypothetical non - gravitational force field . such an alternative explanation is rather conservative , since it assumes neither a cosmological constant ( or negative - pressure fluid ) nor a modification of general relativity .",
    "accordingly , we first work out a self - consistent , non - geometric model for the cosmic acceleration that is able to reproduce the current observations of standard candles ( i.e. snia ) and then we discuss a falsifiability procedure aimed at testing its observational predictions .    the motivation behind this work is to put strong limits on a hypothetical ( or non usually considered ) physics that is possibly missing in our picture of the universe , and , in turn , to strengthen the evidence supporting the standard paradigm with which we are currently explaining its past history , its present stage and its future fate .",
    "our goal is to work out testable predictions that allow us to reject non - metric acceleration models . to this end , we construct here a general , phenomenological model in which the role of dark energy is mimicked by an alternative mechanism of non - gravitational origin .",
    "we consider here a background universe with a metric expansion as predicted by general relativity .",
    "we assume that in such a universe a hypothetical large ",
    "scale , non - gravitational force field influences the overall dynamics of large scale structures in a patch of the universe with typical dimensions of the local hubble volume . in this scenario",
    "every object which at time @xmath3 sits on the shell of a sphere of proper radius @xmath4 centered on the observer feels a peculiar acceleration field @xmath5 that is radially directed and time dependent .",
    "+ we further speculate that the only cosmological component contributing to the stress - energy tensor is dark matter . in other words , we assume that there is no dark energy at all in the universe and that what we interpret as apparent isotropic acceleration of the metric is indeed the combination of the decelerated cosmological expansion predicted by general relativity plus the doppler effect sourced by matter which is accelerating outward under the effect of the radial force field we have added to this cosmological scenario .",
    "in such a case , by appropriately tuning the non - cosmological contribution to the observed redshift , one can reconstruct a functional form for the luminosity distance @xmath6 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq.dlgeneral ] below ) which reproduces the standard one derived within a model with cosmological constant ( or dark energy ) : i.e. @xmath7 in other words , the standard @xmath8cdm cosmological parameter set ( represented by the vector @xmath9 ) observationally inferred by simply plugging in the observed redshift @xmath10 into the luminosity distance formula are biased with respect to the _ true cosmological _ values ( represented by the vector @xmath11 ) that would be naturally inferred by recognizing the presence of a physical mechanism responsible for the acceleration of matter _ in situ_.    having outlined the phenomenological model we are pursuing , let us now elucidate its finer details , i.e. the dependence of the luminosity distance ( eq .",
    "1 ) on the peculiar acceleration term @xmath12 . +",
    "the luminosity distance of an object standing at the observed redshift @xmath10 is given , in a pure matter scenario , by @xmath13 \\ ; ,   \\label{eq.dlgeneral}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 , @xmath15 ( if @xmath16 ) , @xmath17 ( if @xmath18 ) , @xmath19 ( if @xmath20 ) , and @xmath21^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "+ while in the standard model the measured redshift @xmath10 has a pure cosmological interpretation , in the accelerated model it additionally includes the contribution of the peculiar velocity @xmath22 induced by the radial non gravitational field and it can be written as @xmath23 clearly , there are an infinite variety of cosmological models that , when combined with an equally arbitrary variety of radial acceleration fields @xmath12 , could in principle reproduce the observational features of the standard cosmological model .",
    "so , for the sake of simplicity , and in order to capture the essential physics of the problem , we assume in the following that the universe is flat , that its total density is contributed only by matter @xmath24 , and its expansion rate is @xmath25 .",
    "+ under these hypotheses , the luminosity distance can be written as @xmath26^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\big\\ } \\ ; , \\label{eq.dl_om1}\\ ] ] nonetheless , we stress that these working assumptions do not influence the generality of the conclusions presented in @xmath27 : analogous considerations hold , in fact , for a low density universe , open universe ( with , e.g. , @xmath28 ) .",
    "we can now compute how a peculiar velocity @xmath22 in this scenario depends on the peculiar acceleration field : @xmath29 $ ] at a given cosmological redshift @xmath30 .",
    "+ using the expression of the proper distance to a given coordinate , @xmath31 , we obtain the expression of the acceleration @xmath32 by means of which a perturbed metric expands radially : @xmath33 where @xmath34 and the peculiar acceleration term is given by @xmath35 after transforming this equation from the time to the redshift domain , we find the general solution @xmath36 we model the peculiar acceleration term in this equation by means of a general , non - divergent polynomial function @xmath37 where the @xmath38 are free parameters to be adjusted with the constraint given by eq .",
    "1 . note that in the absence of a peculiar acceleration acting on cosmic matter , we recover the standard result that any primordial peculiar velocity is damped by the background expansion ( i.e. , @xmath39 ) .      we show here that by appropriately tuning the parameters @xmath38 we can match the luminosity distance @xmath6 of standard candles like snia as inferred within the standard model of cosmology .",
    "+ to this end , we first set the integration constant @xmath40 by imposing that , in the limit @xmath41 , the peculiar velocity @xmath42 .",
    "we also set @xmath43 in order to avoid any primordial acceleration field .",
    "then , we fit eq .",
    "[ eq.dlgeneral ] to reproduce the currently available supernovae data .",

    "note that , in general , this is the order of magnitude of any large - scale , peculiar acceleration field one needs to introduce in order to reinterpret snia data over the redshift range @xmath53 .",
    "for @xmath54 , the distance modulus predicted within this paradigm converges to the standard behavior expected in the underlying , decelerated , cosmological model because the peculiar perturbation vanishes at early epochs .",
    "we stress here that , by definition , the acceleration induced by such an hypothetical non - gravitational force should act differentially on the baryonic and non - baryonic matter components .",
    "therefore , any possible non - gravitational accelerating mechanisms are physically viable only if it does not destroy ( e.g. , by segregating it into parts ) the astronomical object on which they act ( for instance , by segregating the dark matter halo from the luminous baryonic component hosted within it ) . in other words ,",
    "the acceleration time scale @xmath55 in a cosmological frame has to be much larger than the typical dynamical time scale @xmath56 of a system trapped inside a dark matter halo .",
    "+ by inserting the time - averaged value of eq .",

    "this simple physical argument puts stringent constraints on the viability of such a class of models . unless one is willing to consider non standard model of gravity sourced only by baryons [ e.g. , mond ( milgrom 1983 ) or teves theories ( bekenstein 2004 ) ] , or as yet unexplored interactions mediated by the dark matter particles",
    ", one can use the previous argument to doubt the physical reliability of such non - gravitational acceleration mechanism .",
    "moreover , models of non - cosmological acceleration that are able to reproduce the metric acceleration without invoking the effect of dark energy are not positively defined over all the epoch of cosmological interest . specifically , to explain the acceleration of distant standard candles without violating local constraints",
    ", one would need to invoke an acceleration of opposite sign at low and high redshift ( see the left panel of fig .",
    "1 ) . additionally , these models yield also quite high peculiar velocities , which can even be of the order of a tenth of the speed of light at a characteristic epoch of @xmath61 ( see the right panel of fig .",
    "1 ) . in principle",
    ", the strong sensitivity of the value of the large - scale peculiar velocity in such scenarios can also be used to put constraints on the viability of the non - gravitational acceleration models .",
    "on one hand , one must mention the ability of these models to handle the age - problem in frw cosmologies with no dark energy . a recurring argument for a dark energy component",
    "has come from considerations that the observed stellar ages are too long to be consistent with the observed hubble parameter @xmath62 km s@xmath63 mpc@xmath63 for an universe which has always been decelerating . since our results have been presented , for the sake of illustration , for a flat cdm model , they are consistent with the stellar estimates of the age of the universe only if low values of @xmath64 km s@xmath63 mpc@xmath63 are viable @xcite .",
    "although there are authors claiming  given the still large systematic uncertainties affecting @xmath65 measurements  that at present the age argument can not be used to definitively exclude the einstein de sitter model and , therefore , arguing for a cosmological constant @xcite @xcite , we note here that the non gravitational acceleration models can naturally reconcile decelerated background cosmological models with the age of the oldest stars in the universe .    as a matter of fact the observed hubble constant evaluated by comparing the observed redshift ( @xmath10 ) with redshift - independent distance indicators ( d ) would overestimate the true universal value @xmath65 obtained by using , as prescribed by theory , the cosmological redshift ( z ) .",
    "the snia hubble diagram is constructed in such a way to be independent of the values of @xmath65 .",
    "anyway , one can directly estimate the amplitude of the @xmath65 bias . in the accelerated model the expansion rate in the local universe",
    "is overestimated by a factor @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , at @xmath67 , the isotropic peculiar expansion needed to recover a hubble parameter of @xmath68 km s@xmath63 mpc@xmath63 is of order of @xmath69 .",
    "we stress here the analogy between this _reconciliation mechanism_ and the one invoked within the ` hubble bubble ' scenarios .",
    "in fact , in such models @xcite we are supposed to live inside an underdense region ( hubble bubble ) that is expanding faster than the average .",
    "measurements of the hubble constant within the underdense region would therefore overestimate the universal value by @xmath70 thus offering a different way to bypass the age problem within a decelerating background metric .",
    "we will see in the next session , however , that a crucial observational test can be devised to reject such non - gravitational acceleration mechanisms .",
    "we now discuss the observable effects that a hypothetical non - gravitational force field , say a  _ dark force field _ , should have on the global expansion of the universe , as traced by a set of distant standard candles ( e.g. , snia ) .",
    "we show that the physical imprints of such a _ ` dark force ' _ can be unambiguously contrasted with those of a _ ` dark energy ' _ component .",
    "in particular , it is possible to discriminate between them directly in the hubble diagram rather than , as usually done , in the equation of state parameter space . indeed ,",
    "if such a non - gravitational , radial force field exists ( see , e.g. , the preliminary suggestion that a large - scale magnetic tension might mimic the effects of dark energy @xcite , or the equivalent proposal of a large local void @xcite ) , we can show that it accelerates cosmological objects ( test particles ) at the same radial distance in a different way .",
    "in fact , since only the gravitational force has the property to depend on the gravitational mass  which via the equivalence principle is equal to the inertial mass  it follows that , in the proposed ` _ dark force _ ' scenario sne are not inertial systems in free - fall along geodesics of the space - time . the acceleration of sne will thus have a unique signature : it will depend on the mass of the hosting system .",
    "since in this _ dark force _ scenario the luminosity distance @xmath71 of a cosmic object depends on its acceleration ( see eq .",
    "[ eq.dl_om1 ] and [ eq.wz ] ) , the different inertial masses of the test particles will cause predictable deviations from the mean , best fitting curve shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "2 .    one can parameterize the mass dependence of the peculiar acceleration experienced by a given system @xmath72 in terms of the best fitting mean acceleration @xmath73 using a simple scaling law    @xmath74    where the exponent @xmath75 characterizes the specific physical mechanism responsible for the acceleration of supernovae .",
    "the limiting case @xmath76 describes the action of the gravitational field showing that , in this case , the acceleration of test particles is mass - independent .",
    "in contrast , the acceleration generated by non - gravitational force fields is generically described by setting @xmath77 . in particular",
    ", the case @xmath78 illustrates the large class of force fields in which the acceleration is inversely proportional to the mass of the test particle ( for example models in which the strength of the force is independent of the mass of the object experiencing the field ) .     in eq .",
    "[ acmo ] and by letting the minimum and maximum mass of the test particles ( sne host systems ) vary over five orders of magnitude i.e. , from normal isolated galaxies to galaxy clusters.,width=529 ]    for the sake of simplicity let us discuss first the case @xmath78 .",
    "a direct consequence of this assumption is that , at fixed redshift , sne hosted in isolated normal galaxies ( with typical mass of @xmath79 ) , when subject to the force field we are challenging here , will experience an acceleration of order @xmath80 stronger than sne hosted in rich galaxy clusters ( with typical mass of @xmath81 ) .",
    "( we assume here that the masses of the host systems remain constant with time ) .",
    "this effect systematically shifts the distance modulus of sne in low ( high ) mass hosts towards higher ( lower ) values with respect to the reference , best fitting curve characterizing supernovae hosted in some fiducial system of mass @xmath82 ( see fig . [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "similarly , and without loss of generality , we find that for all the values @xmath83 , ( i.e. even in the extreme cases of an acceleration field which has a weak dependence on the host mass ) , the family of distance moduli associated to sne hosted in systems whose mass differs by up to five orders of magnitude still spans the whole dispersion region characterizing current data . the systematic deviation from the best fitting relation of the distance moduli of supernovae hosted in a large variety of systems , going from small to large masses , is therefore practically insensitive to the exponent @xmath75 parameterizing the mass dependence of the acceleration felt by supernovae .",
    "this general result follows from the fact that a ) the distance modulus calculated by including the peculiar acceleration term can not be smaller than the one computed in the associated background cosmological model , and b ) to each value of the exponent @xmath75 one can always associate an appropriately tuned value of the fiducial mass in the range @xmath84 in such a way that a change of five orders of magnitude in the mass of the host gives distance moduli which are always confined between the upper and lower envelopes of the dispersion in the snia hubble diagram .",
    "therefore , we conclude that in a _ dark force _ scenario , part of the scatter in the snia hubble diagram has a physical origin : for a fixed redshift @xmath30 and @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) , snia with larger values of @xmath87 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] should be hosted in small ( big ) systems , while snia with smaller values of @xmath87 should be hosted in rich clusters ( isolated normal galaxies ) .    to summarize , a null - test of the metric nature of the accelerated expansion can be easily performed by means of an environmental analysis of the cosmic structures in which snia are found .",
    "such a study could be optimally performed by future large - area sky surveys of distant sne such as snap @xcite .",
    "the strong sensitivity to the host system mass of the test strategy that we suggest here will allow to exclude any hypothetical non - metric large - scale interaction which could be in principle responsible for the observed kinematics of the universe .",
    "such a result would hence shed a much clearer light on the nature of the assumed dark energy component dominating the late stages of the cosmic evolution .",
