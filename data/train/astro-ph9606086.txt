    "these appear to be real features in the pv arrays for they also are present in the 88th order to the right hand side of each display .",

    "3(d ) as part of a coherent feature in the pv array of [ n  ii]@xmath10  6548  profiles , though superficially persuasive , must remain doubtful . if these two knots have their origin in the [ n  ii]@xmath10  6548  profiles then they should be clearly present in the three times brighter [ n  ii]@xmath10  6584  profiles .",
    "tests on the data have demonstrated their absence in the [ n  ii]@xmath10  6584  profiles at the appropriate level .",

    "however , such a chance alignment for such very different ranges in radial velocity seems highly unlikely .",

    ".motions of the outer shell .",
    "( * )  these knots are single features in the pv arrays .",
    "the starred radial velocities assume that they are of h@xmath0  origin and alternative unstarred values ( for slit  4 knots  1  &  2 ) if of [ n  ii]@xmath10  6548  origin .",
    "the peak intensity ratio of [ n  ii]@xmath10  6584  @xmath18h@xmath0  is given in the final column .",

    "new kinematical information has been obtained for three separate features of the @xmath1  carinae nebulosity .",
    "the implications for the  outer shellof knots , the ` spike ' and the ` arc ' will now be discussed along with consideration of the mechanisms that cause the ionization of the high - speed ejecta .      if the knots in the outer ` shell ' in figs .  1  &  2 form part of a coherent feature then it is firstly notable that its centroid is offset by @xmath7  12@xmath9 to the ne of @xmath1  carinae . in any case",
    "a simple interpretation of this whole feature as a radially expanding irregular shell is apparently contradicted by the kinematical observations shown in figs .",
    "3(a)-(c ) .",
    "this contradiction is epitomised by the profiles in the pv array along slits  1 ,  2  &  3 in figs .",
    "3(a),(b )  &  ( c ) respectively , which pass over what could be the edge of the outer ` shell ' . in these arrays , certainly detected velocity features , which are bright in the [ n ii ] lines , extend all the way out to @xmath7  @xmath21200  @xmath3 ( eg . see slit  2 knot  5 ) from the systemic radial velocity .",
    "single profiles at the systemic radial velocity ( v@xmath17  @xmath7  @xmath210  @xmath3 ) would be expected to characterise the edge of a simple , radially expanding shell .",
    "even more extreme h@xmath0  bright knots are suggested out to @xmath21450  @xmath3 ( eg . see slit  3 knot  6 and slit  2 knot  10 ) .",
    "the complex profiles in the pv array in fig .",
    "3(a ) from the knots along the north eastern edge of the outer shell , covered by slit  1 , exhibit approaching , radial velocities out to @xmath7  @xmath2200  @xmath3 from an extended region , as well as a component at the systemic radial velocity .",
    "however , the knots in the north western quadrant of the outer ` shell ' , covered also by slit  1 , emit the [ n  ii ] line from a region 1@xmath9 across whose profiles have fwhms of @xmath7  80  @xmath3 but are displaced to _ receding _ radial velocities of @xmath7  + 250  @xmath3 with respect to the systemic radial velocity .",
    "note that the nearby ` lobe ' of the inner shell ( identified in fig .",
    "1 ) and the southern part of this shell ( s ridge in walborn et al 1978 ) was shown in paper 1 to emit red - shifted line profiles out to + 400  @xmath3 with respect to the systemic radial velocity ( see slits 12@xmath9n and 4 , 8 & 12@xmath9s in fig .  5 of paper  1 )",
    ". some of the present ( and previous - see papers 1 , 2 & 3 ) kinematical observations are then consistent with the ` polar blowout ' model of hester et al ( 1991 ) ( and its precursor model in paper  1 - see fig .",
    "what is loosely described as the outer ` shell ' of knots in fig .  1 is composed nearly exclusively of ionized material flowing towards the observer even around its perimeter . these knots ( and the ` jet '  see paper  3 )",
    "must all then be a consequence of an approaching outflow on the nearside of the bi - polar axis of the dusty homunculus reflection nebula ( paper  2 ) .",

    "1 are then on the far side of the homunculus and flowing away from the observer .",
    "the ` spike ' and ` arc ' in fig .",
    "1 are similarly flowing towards the observer but are elongated well beyond the se end of the bi - polar axis of the homunculus .",
    "they would clearly have to have an extreme configuration to make them part of a simple ` polar blowout ' from the centre of the homunculus but are likely to be closely related to this eruptive event .      of particular interest",

    "a faint velocity component can be traced in the same pv array from this approaching radial velocity right back to the systemic radial velocity .",
    "the ` spike ' is also intercepted by slit  3 ( knot  5 in fig .",
    "3(c ) and table  1 ) where it now has v@xmath17  @xmath7  @xmath2850  @xmath3 .",
    "the present kinematical observations of the ` spike ' along slit  2 should be interpreted along with those from it but nearer to @xmath1  carinae in paper  1 ( ew slit positions 8@xmath9 & 12@xmath9  s  fig .  5 in that paper ) .",
    "the pv arrays across the ` spike ' for these two previous positions reveal a spatially resolved velocity feature that extends continuously out to @xmath7  @xmath2700  @xmath3 from the systemic radial velocity .",
    "the ` spike ' identified in fig .  1 and seen in fig .",
    "4(b ) has a width of a few arcseconds within the ` inner shell ' of collisionally ionized gas ( see paper 1 ) and decreases from @xmath7  0.35@xmath9  at 18@xmath9  from @xmath1  carinae ( where it is intercepted by slit  2 ) to 0.25@xmath9  at 26@xmath9  ( slit  3 ) .",
    "an elongated cavity , with thin outflowing walls was suggested as an explanation of this feature in paper  1 .",
    "it was proposed that the spike - like appearance arose as the cavity walls were viewed tangentially .",
    "the present kinematical observations ( which are further from @xmath1  carinae than the earlier ones ) and the hst imagery suggest that the ` spike ' could be a jet ie . a narrow , collimated outflow exhibiting some form of acceleration or directional variation to produce a change of v@xmath17  from @xmath2650  @xmath3 to @xmath2850  @xmath3 between its interception by slits  2  &  3 .",
    "an estimate of the outflow velocity of the ` spike ' , if a jet , depends critically on its orientation with respect to the plane of the sky .",
    "one guide to this angle , @xmath0 , could be the measured orientation for e5 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "this has been derived from the proper motion of 5@xmath9/century of e5 from @xmath1  carinae ( walborn & blanco 1989 ) which , for a distance of 2.6  kpc combined with the radial velocity difference of @xmath7  @xmath2140  @xmath3 ( table  1 ) gives an outflow velocity of 620  @xmath3 tilted at @xmath0  =  13@xmath19 to the sky for this group of knots e5 marked in fig .  1 .",
    "with this same angle a speed of @xmath73800  @xmath3 is then predicted by the measured value of v@xmath17  =  @xmath2850  @xmath3 for the tip of the ` spike ' . for a constant velocity away from @xmath1  carinae the ` spike ' would then have originated in an eruptive event around 1890 .",
    "this is near the time of major outbursts listed by walborn & liller ( 1977 ) .",
    "perhaps , the orientation of the ` spike ' can estimated more realistically if it assumed that its directional variations _ in the plane of the sky _ , which give an apparent change of 15@xmath20 between where it is intercepted by slits 2 and 3 , are of similar magnitude to directional changes perpendicular to the plane of the sky .",
    "this would cause the radial velocity difference of @xmath2200  @xmath3 between these two positions even if , more realistically , no acceleration is assumed . in this case @xmath21",
    "37@xmath20 is predicted with a jet speed of 1077  @xmath3 giving an age of @xmath7  360  yr for the tip of the ` spike ' , which is before records of the eruptions of @xmath1  carinae are available though this speed must be subject to large uncertainties .",
    "incidentally , the converging sides of the ` spike ' can be explained as part of a jet structure if the [ n  ii ] emission is from recollimation shocks ( cf .",
    "paper  3 ) .",
    "a model of the spectrun of davidson et al .",
    "( 1986 ) of an [ n  ii ] bright knot in the outer shell of the @xmath1  carinae nebula ( by john raymond and reported in meaburn et al .",
    "( 1988 ) ) gave a shock velocity of 140  @xmath3 .",
    "in any case , the shock velocities can not be higher than this value for the small knots in the outer shell of @xmath1  carinae to be ionized by radiative shocks .",
    "since [ n  ii ] emission requires the shocks to be @xmath8  100  @xmath3 , the aspect ratio of the convergent part of the spike will be roughly @xmath22 , i.e. @xmath4  5:1 in projection for a jet speed of 1077  @xmath3 which is easily satisfied by the observed high aspect ratio of the ` spike ' .",
    "unusual kinematical features also occur along slits  4  &  5 over the ridge marked ` arc ' in fig .  1 which appears to originate near the knot marked e5 .",
    "incidentally , a detailed inspection of the hst image in fig .",
    "2 reveals that both e5 and the northern end of the ` arc ' are composed of a conglomeration of emission line knots as small as 0.3@xmath9 across .",
    "it is in the profiles from slit  4 over this ` arc ' that the strange loop ( discussed in sect .",
    "2 ) in the pv arrays occurs ( slit  4 knots  1    3 in fig .",
    "3(d ) and table  1 ) .",

    "a conical shell is assumed to have a ratio of thickness to radius of 0.15 .",
    "the ionized gas within this shell is given , somewhat arbitarily , a flow velocity along its surface of 1500  @xmath3 ( similar to the well - verified speed of the jet in paper  3 ) .",
    "the full opening angle of the cone from the image in fig .  2 and the aat photograph is taken to be 26@xmath23 .",
    "the angle between the axis of the cone and the plane of the sky is 18@xmath23 .",
    "the slit is oriented at 30@xmath23 with respect to the axis of the cone to simulate approximately its orientation to the ` arc ' in fig .  1 . the predictions of this model ( fig .",

    "7(a ) ( if these are all assumed to be of [ n  ii]@xmath10  6548  origin ) .",
    "uniform volume emissivity of the line emission within the cone would give rise to a completely closed ellipse in the predicted pv array in fig .",
    "however , in the model , the volume emissivity has been reduced in one section of the cone until a reasonable match was achieved to the brightness variations within the observed loop in the pv array .",
    "this self consistent set of key parameters ( the opening angle , the speed and the angle between the cone s axis and the sky ) is constrained to within ten percent by the radial velocity range of @xmath24  @xmath2130  to @xmath2900  @xmath3 respectively in the observed pv array from the ` arc '  ( figs .",
    "3(d ) and 7(a ) ) .",
    "an outflowing cone of line emitting knots , perhaps starting in an , as yet unspecified , manner from the brighter e5 group of knots , is therefore suggested as the explanation of this arc - like feature .",
    "the absence of the comparable radial velocity components in the [ n  ii]@xmath10  6584  line profiles makes this interpretation of the ` loop ' uncertain .",
    "however , one possible way of suppressing the comparable [ n  ii]@xmath10  6584  emission features ( for slit  4  knots  1  &  2 ) with approaching radial velocities could be if a localised , but foreground , receding flow of h  ii gas was present with sufficient density to absorb only the most negative high velocity [ n  ii]@xmath10  6584  features .",
    "it may be relevant that there is a positive velocity extension in the h@xmath0  pv array over this for slit  4 in fig .",
    "3  d. this mechanism however requires the electron temperature , t@xmath25 , high enough so that the foreground column of h(n=2 ) has @xmath26  1 but also t@xmath25 low enough that it is fainter than the [ n  ii ] itself and since @xmath27}~\\ll$ ]  1 this may be difficult .    the alternative interpretation of slit  4  knots  1  &  2 as emitting h@xmath0   only would of course invalidate the model for the ` arc ' in fig .",
    "note that a measured decline in the [ n  ii]@xmath10  6584  / h@xmath0  ratio is shown in fig .  5 which suggests that knots with extreme radial velocities ( starred in table  1 ) could be undetectable in both the [ n  ii]@xmath10  6548  and [ n  ii]@xmath10  6584  lines but still at h@xmath0 .",
    "incidentally raymond ( 1991 ) has demonstrated that pure balmer line emission can be produced by non - radiative shocks in partially neutral gas . a decisive test of these two alternative interpretations of this loop in the pv array shown in fig .",
    "3(d ) awaits observations of the [ s  ii]@xmath106716 & 6731  lines .",

    "3.3 ) , all of the major groups of low ionization knots that constitute the ` outer shell ' in fig .",
    "1 have measurable proper motions away from @xmath1  carinae ( walborn & blanco  1989 ) .",
    "these large proper motions alone favour their origin in bullets of plasma ejected from @xmath1  carinae ( during the outburst 150 years ago ) but now ploughing into slower moving material perhaps from previous ejections . in this case",
    ", a fundamental problem is immediately encountered . if the velocities of the bullets relative to the ambient gas are @xmath4  1000  @xmath3 , as suggested for many of the supersonic features revealed in figs .",
    "3(a)-(e ) , then bow  shock velocities of the same magnitude are anticipated which should generate post ",
    "shock emission at x ",
    "ray wavelengths at their apices ( which are observed from both the ` lobe ' and the region of the ` spike ' and e5 in fig . 1 by chlebowski et al ( 1984 ) ) .",
    "shock velocities must be restricted to @xmath8  100  @xmath3 for the post - shock emission of [ n ii ] nebular lines that are observed here ( e.g. raymond 1979 ) , which would only occur for material passing very obliquely through the extreme wings of any bow - shocks around such high - speed bullets .",
    "a similar difficulty was encountered in interpreting [ n  ii ] line profiles along the ` jet ' in paper  3 for it is flowing , episodically , at a speed of @xmath8  1500  @xmath3 away from @xmath1  carinae .",
    "it was suggested that the narrow , highly blue - shifted [ n  ii ] profiles from the knots in the ` jet ' originate in slow shocks driven into dense bullets rather than from the post bow - shock regions around the bullets .",
    "emission of the highly blue - shifted [ n  ii ] profiles from behind a bow  shock around a high - speed bullet encountering an @xmath7  100  @xmath3 slower shell could also be considered to overcome this problem .",
    "this mechanism could explain the knots which exhibit a very narrow range of radial velocities , albeit highly shifted from the systemic , eg . that are seen in the western part of the pv array in fig .",
    "however , the large range in radial velocities of some of the phenomena reported here ( eg . over the ` spike ' and ` arc ' in fig",
    ".  1 ) are not compatible with post bow - shock emission from bullets and ambient gas which have small differential velocities .",
    "the fine - scale knottiness of all the emission regions seen in figs . 2 , 4(a ) and",
    "( b ) may suggest that the ejecta fragments take the form of ` grape - shot ' rather than individual ` bullets ' .",
    "cid - fernandes et al ( 1996 ) have recently shown how individual clumps in the ejecta of supernovae can be fragmented into ` grape - shot ' as they pass through a reverse shock .",
    "these grape - shot clumps then propagate easily through the shocked ejecta and shocked ambient medium before colliding directly with the external ambient medium , at velocities little less than those at which they were driven by the initial explosion .",
    "similar processes may well occur in outburst ejecta such as those seen in @xmath1 car .",
    "if the individual globules within the cloud of condensations are at least 150 times as dense as the surrounding medium , the reverse shocks driven into 1200 @xmath3 ejecta will be slow enough to radiate [ n  ii ] at velocities close to the ejecta velocity ( cf . slit 2 knot 5 ; in contrast 1500 @xmath3 ejecta such as knot 10 may still be non - radiative , or at least have fast enough reverse shocks to prevent [ n  ii ] emission ) .",
    "once the reverse shocks have traversed the clumps , they will be rapidly dispersed by turbulence eddies , and mixed with gas from the ambient medium .",
    "the residual momentum of this lower density gas will drive weak shocks into the surrounding ambient medium .",
    "succeeding blobs will encounter this mildly - shocked ambient medium , which would now have a 100 @xmath3 or so outward velocity and an increased gas density .",
    "before they overtook the shock driven by the first generation of blobs , doubly - shocked ambient gas would generate [ n  ii ] emission at velocities up to 200 @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , this may be the explanation for structures such as slit 2 knots 2(a - d ) .",
    "while cid - fernandes et al ( 1996 ) have provided initial theoretical support for the possibility of such mechanisms , much work beyond the scope of the present paper is required to fully model the origin and evolution of grape - shot ejecta .",

    "the absence of the most negative velocity features in the corresponding [ n  ii]@xmath10  6584  profiles casts doubt on this interpretation .",
    "somewhat artificial means can be introduced to overcome this problem .",
