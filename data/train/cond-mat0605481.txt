    "in the history of physics the studies of thermal radiation from materials always played a very important role . here , it is enough to mention that quantum mechanics originated from the attempts to explain a paradoxical experimental results related to the black body radiation . in the past ,",
    "the nonradiative near - field part of electromagnetic radiation usually was ignored , because it plays no role in the far - field properties of emission from planar sources .",
    "nevertheless , recent interest in microscale and nanoscale radiative heat transfer @xcite , together with the development of local - probe thermal microscopy @xcite have raised new challenges .",
    "these topics , and the progress in detecting non - contact friction on sub - attonewton level @xcite , and the observation of coherent thermal emission from doped silicon and silicon carbide ( sic ) gratings @xcite have in common the substantial role of the nonradiative ( evanescent ) thermal field .",
    "it is well known that the radiative heat transfer between two bodies separated by @xmath2 is given by the stefan - boltzmann law : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the temperatures of solid @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively . in this limiting case the heat transfer between two black bodies is determined by the propagating electromagnetic waves radiated by the bodies , and does not depend on the separation @xmath8 .",
    "for @xmath9 the heat transfer increases by many orders of magnitude due to the evanescent electromagnetic waves that decay exponentially into the vacuum ; this is often refereed to as photon tunneling . at low temperatures ( a few k ) it is possible for this form of heat transfer to be dominant even at spacing of a few mm ,",
    "see table 1 .",
    "0.3 cm * table 1*. critical distance @xmath10 as a function of temperature . for surface separation @xmath9",
    "the heat transfer is dominated by the contribution from the evanescent electromagnetic modes . at distances of a few nanometers ,",
    "radiative heat flow is almost entirely due to evanescent modes .    [",
    "cols=\"<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     0.3 cm the problem of the radiative heat transfer between two flat surfaces was considered some years ago by polder and van hove @xcite , levin and rytov @xcite and more recently by pendry @xcite , and by volokitin and persson @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the heat flux can be greatly enhanced if the electrical conductivities of the materials are chosen such as to maximize the heat flow due to photon tunneling . at room temperature",
    "the heat flow is maximal for materials with conductivities corresponding to semi - metals .",
    "in fact , only a thin film ( @xmath11 ) of a high - resistivity material is needed to maximize the heat flux @xcite .",
    "another enhancement mechanism of the radiative heat transfer may arise from resonant photon tunneling between localized states on the different surfaces , if the frequency of these modes is sufficiently low to be excited by thermal radiation .",
    "recently , it was predicted enhancement of the heat transfer due to resonant photon tunneling between surface plasmon modes localized on the surfaces of the semiconductors @xcite and adsorbate vibrational modes @xcite .",
    "the problem of radiative heat transfer is closely related to the non - contact friction between nanostructures , including , for example , the frictional drag force between two - dimensional quantum wells @xcite , and the friction force between an atomic force microscope tip and a substrate @xcite    recently several groups have observed unexpectedly large long - range non - contact friction @xcite .",
    "the friction force @xmath12 acting on an atomic force microscope tip was found to be proportional to the velocity @xmath13 , @xmath14 . at the separation @xmath15 the friction coefficient @xmath16kg / s .",
    "although the non - contact friction must have an electromagnetic origin , the detailed mechanisms is not fully understood yet .    in a recent letter , dorofeyev _ et.al .",
    "_ @xcite claim that the non - contact friction observed in @xcite is due to ohmic losses mediated by the fluctuating electromagnetic field .",
    "this result is controversial , however , since the van der waals friction has been shown @xcite to be many orders of magnitude smaller than the friction observed by dorofeyev _ et.al .",
    "_ however , we have shown that when the surfaces are separated by about 1 nm , the van der waals friction can be greatly enhanced by resonant photon tunneling @xcite .",
    "thus , we found that resonant photon tunneling between two semiconductors surfaces of sic , which can support surface plasmon modes in mid - infrared region , may give rise a 1000-fold ( or more ) enhancement of the friction , in comparison with the case of good conductors .",
    "furthermore , resonant photon tunneling between two cu(100 ) surface covered by 0.1 monolayer of k may result in six orders of magnitude enhancement of friction compared to clean surfaces . at the separation 1 nm we obtained a friction comparable in magnitude with the friction observed in the experiment @xcite .",
    "the origin of the van der waals friction is very closely connected with ordinary ( attractive ) van der waals interaction .",
    "the van der waals interaction between atoms ( or molecules ) arises from quantum fluctuations in the electric dipole moment of atoms .",
    "the short - lived atomic polarity can induce a dipole moment in a neighboring atom or molecule at some distance away .",
    "the same is true for extended solids , where thermal and quantum fluctuation of the current density in one body induces a current density in another body .",
    "when two bodies are in relative motion , the induced current will lag slightly behind the fluctuating current inducing it , this lag is the origin of the van der waals friction .",
    "in contrast to the van der waals interaction , for which a well established theory exist @xcite , the field of van der waals friction is still controversial .",
    "thus different authors @xcite have derived expression for the van der waals friction between two flat surfaces and between a small particle and flat surface using different methods , and obtained results , which were not confirmed in subsequent calculations @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "we have developed the theory of the van der waals friction based on a dynamical modification of the well known lifshitz theory @xcite of the van der waals interaction . in the nonretarded limit , and for zero temperature , this theory agree with the results of pendry @xcite .",
    "we have also calculated the van der waals friction between two flat surfaces in normal relative motion @xcite , and found a drastic difference in comparison with parallel relative motion . in the limit ,",
    "when one of the bodies is sufficiently rarefied , our theory gives the friction between flat surface and small particle , which agrees with the results of tomassone and widom @xcite .",
    "the organization of this article is as follows . in sec.2",
    "we present a short overview of the main principles of the radiative heat transfer , focusing mainly on the adsorbate vibrational mode enhancement of the radiative heat transfer . in sec.3",
    "we study the van der waals friction , and its enhancement due to surface polaritons and adsorbates . in the light of our theoretical results",
    ", we also discuss non - contact friction experiments .",
    "finally , sec.4 contains the summary .",
    "according to @xcite the heat transfer between two semi - infinite bodies , separated by a vacuum gap with the width @xmath17 , is given by the formula @xmath18 where @xmath19 @xmath20    \\label{heat},\\ ] ] and where the symbol @xmath21 $ ] stands for the terms which are obtained from the first two terms by replacing the reflection coefficient @xmath22 for @xmath23-polarized electromagnetic waves with the reflection coefficient @xmath24 for @xmath25- polarized electromagnetic waves , and where @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "the planck function of solid * 1 * @xmath28 and similar for @xmath29 .",
    "the contributions to the heat transfer from the propagating ( @xmath30 ) and evanescent ( @xmath31 ) electromagnetic waves are determined by the first and the second terms in eq.([heat ] ) , respectively .    from eq.([heat ] ) it is easy to see that the propagating photon modes give the main contribution to the heat transfer for @xmath32 , while the evanescent modes for @xmath33 .",
    "thus from phase space arguments it follows that the number of the channels of the heat transfer available for evanescent waves will be by a factor @xmath34 larger than the number of the channel available for propagating waves . at @xmath35 nm and @xmath36k ,",
    "this ratio is of the order @xmath37 .",
    "let us firstly consider some general consequences of eq .",
    "( [ heat ] ) . in the case of the heat transfer through free photons ( @xmath38 ) , the transfer is maximal when both the bodies are perfectly black and have zero reflection amplitude @xmath39 .",
    "the heat flux due to the evanescent waves is a maximal when @xcite @xmath40 substituting this result into ( [ heat ] ) gives the maximal contribution from the evanescent waves @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a cut - off in @xmath43 , determined by the properties of the material .",
    "it is clear that the largest possible @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is an inter - atomic distance .",
    "thus , from eqs.([heleven ] ) and ( [ stefan ] ) we get the ratio of the maximum heat flux connected with evanescent waves to the heat flux due to black body radiation @xmath46 .",
    "thus , at room temperature the contribution to the heat flux from evanescent waves may be eight orders of magnitude larger than the contribution from the black body radiation , and the upper boundary for the heat transfer at room temperature : @xmath47 .",
    "let us now apply the general theory to a few different materials . for good conductors , using fresnel formulas for reflection coefficient and assuming @xmath48 , and @xmath49 ( @xmath50 is the conductivity ) the contribution to the heat transfer from @xmath23-polarized waves for good conductors ( @xmath51 ) is given by @xmath52 and for the metal with lower conductivity ( @xmath53 ) , for @xmath54 we get @xmath55 for good conductors the heat flux depends on the separation as @xmath56 , and increases with decreasing conductivity as @xmath57 . for @xmath53",
    "the heat flux decreases with separation as @xmath58 , and increases with decreasing conductivity as @xmath59 , while the @xmath25-wave contribution is distance independent , @xmath60 .",
    "1a shows the heat transfer between two semi - infinite silver bodies separated by the distance @xmath8 , at the temperatures @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the @xmath25- and @xmath23-wave contributions are shown separately . the @xmath23-wave contribution has been calculated using non - local optics , i.e. including spatial dispersion of the dielectric function ( the dashed line shows the result using local optics ) .",
    "it is remarkable how important the @xmath25-contribution is even for short distances .",
    "note from fig.1a that the local optics contribution to @xmath63 depends nearly linearly on @xmath64 in the studied distance interval , and that this contribution is much smaller than the @xmath25-wave contribution .",
    "both these observations agree with analytical formulas given above .",
    "however , for the very high - resistivity materials , the @xmath23-wave contribution becomes much more important , and a crossover to a @xmath65-dependence of @xmath63 is observed at short separations @xmath8 . this is illustrated in fig.1b and 1c , which show results for the same parameters as in fig .",
    "1a , except that the electron mean free path has been reduced from @xmath66 ( the electron mean free path for silver at room temperature ) to @xmath67 ( roughly the mean free path in lead at room temperature ) ( fig . 1b ) and @xmath68 ( of order the lattice constant , representing the minimal possible mean free path ) ( fig .",
    "note that when @xmath69 decreases , the @xmath23-wave contribution to the heat transfer increases while the @xmath25-wave contribution decreases . since the mean free path can not be much smaller than the lattice constant , the result in fig .",
    "1c represent the largest possible @xmath23-wave contribution for normal metals",
    ". however , the @xmath23-wave contribution may be even larger for other materials , e.g. , semimetals , with lower carrier concentration than in normal metals . for high resistivity materials , when @xmath70 the heat flux is proportional to the conductivity @xmath71 figure 2 show the thermal flux as a function of the conductivity of the solids .",
    "again we have assumed that one body is at zero temperature and the other at @xmath72 .",
    "the surfaces are separated by @xmath73 .",
    "the heat flux for other separations can be obtained using scaling @xmath74 which holds for high - resistivity materials .",
    "the heat flux is maximal at @xmath75 m@xmath76 .",
    "finally , we note that thin high - resistivity coatings can drastically increase the heat transfer between two solids .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.3 , which shows the heat flux for the case when thin films ( @xmath77 ) of high resistivity material , @xmath78 , are deposited on silver .",
    "( a ) and ( b ) shows the @xmath23- and @xmath25-contributions , respectively .",
    "also shown are the heat flux when the two bodies are made from silver , and from the high resistivity material .",
    "it is interesting to note that while the @xmath23-wave contribution to the heat flux for the coated surfaces is strongly influenced by the coating , the @xmath25-contribution is nearly unaffected .",
    "another case where the heat transfer can be large is when resonant photon tunneling occurs between surface states localized on the different surfaces .",
    "the resonant condition corresponds to the case when the denominators in eq.([heat ] ) are small . for two identical surfaces and @xmath79 , where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the imaginary and real parts of the reflection coefficient",
    ", this corresponds to the resonant condition @xmath82 this condition can be fulfilled in spite of the factor @xmath83 because for evanescent electromagnetic waves there is no restriction on the magnitude of real part or the modulus of @xmath84 .",
    "this opens up the possibility of resonant denominators for @xmath85 .",
    "close to the resonance we can use the approximation @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a constant . then from the resonant condition ( @xmath88 ) we get the positions of the resonance @xmath89 for the resonance condition to be valid the separation @xmath90 between two resonances must be greater than the width @xmath91 of the resonance . from this condition",
    "we get that the two poles approximation is valid for @xmath92 .    for @xmath93 and @xmath94 , we get @xmath95 .",
    "\\label{seven}\\ ] ]    note , that the explicit @xmath8 dependence has dropped out of eq .",
    "( [ seven ] ) .",
    "however , @xmath96 may still be @xmath8- dependent , through the @xmath8- dependence of @xmath97 . for small distances one can expect that @xmath42 is determined by the dielectric properties of the material , and thus does not depend on @xmath8 . in this case",
    "the heat transfer will also be distance independent .",
    "resonant photon tunneling enhancement of the heat transfer is possible for two semiconductor surfaces which can support low - frequency surface plasmon modes in the mid - infrared frequency region .",
    "the reflection factor @xmath22 for clean semiconductor surface at @xmath98 is given by fresnel s formula @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the bulk dielectric function .",
    "as an example , consider two clean surfaces of silicon carbide ( sic ) . the optical properties of this material can be described using an oscillator model @xcite @xmath101 with @xmath102 and @xmath103 the frequency of surface plasmons is determined by condition @xmath104 and from ( [ nine ] ) we get @xmath105 .",
    "the resonance parameters @xmath106    using these parameters in eq.([seven ] ) and assuming that one surface is at temperature @xmath36 k and the other at @xmath107 k we get the heat flux @xmath108 between two clean surfaces of silicon carbide ( sic ) : @xmath109 where the distance @xmath8 is in ngstrm .",
    "note that the heat flux between the two semiconductor surfaces is several order of magnitude larger than between two clean good conductor surfaces ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "another resonant photon tunneling enhancement of the heat transfer is possible between adsorbate vibrational modes localized on different surfaces .",

    "there are no constrain on the particle polarizability @xmath123 other than that @xmath124 is positive , and @xmath125 and @xmath124 are connected by the kramers - kronig relation .",
    "assuming identical surfaces , we are free to maximize the photon - tunneling transmission coefficient @xmath126 this function has a maximum when @xmath127 so that @xmath128 . substituting this result in ( [ four ] ) gives the upper bound for the heat transfer power between the two particles or adsorbates @xmath129 for adsorbed molecules at the concentration @xmath130m@xmath131 ,",

    "thus , van der waals friction between high resistivity material can be measured with the present state - of - art equipment .    as in the case of the radiative heat transfer",
    ", the van der waals friction can be greatly enhanced when resonant photon tunneling between localized surface states , e.g. surface plasmon polaritons and adsorbate vibration modes , occurs . using the same approximation as when deriving eq.([seven ] ) for normal relative motion we get @xmath250 similar , for parallel relative motion    @xmath251    where @xmath252 , and where @xmath45 is of the order of an interatomic distance .",
    "thus if @xmath253 , eq . ( [ 5eight ] ) is independent of the distance . for small distances",
    "one can expect that @xmath42 is determined by the dielectric properties of the material , and does not depend on @xmath8 . in this case",
    "the friction will be also distance independent .",
    "resonant photon tunneling enhancement of the van der waals friction is possible for two semiconductor surfaces which can support low - frequency surface plasmon modes . as an example we consider two clean surfaces of silicon carbide ( sic ) .",
    "the optical properties of this material were described above . using the same parameters as before and at @xmath36k we get @xmath254kg@xmath255 s@xmath158m@xmath131 , where the distance @xmath8 is in ngstrm , and @xmath256 .",
    "note that the friction between the two semiconductors is about three order of magnitude larger than between two clean good metallic conductors ( see fig.(5,6 ) ) .",
    "another enhancement mechanism of van der waals friction is connected with resonant photon tunneling between adsorbate vibrational modes localized on different surfaces . in @xcite",
    "we have shown that resonant photon tunneling between two surfaces covered by a low coverage of potassium atoms at @xmath35 nm gives rise to enhancement in friction by six orders of the magnitude in the comparison with friction between clean surfaces .",
    "the adsorbate induced enhancement of van der waals friction is even larger for the case of cs adsorption on cu(100 ) . in this case",
    "even at small coverage ( @xmath257 ) in adsorbed layer there is acoustic branch for vibrations parallel to the surface @xcite . in this case at small frequencies the reflection coefficient is given by @xcite @xmath258 where @xmath259 , @xmath260 is the damping constant for the adsorbate vibrations parallel to the surface , @xmath173 is the separation between the adsorbate center and image plane . using eq.([adsorbate1 ] ) in eq.([vdwpar ] ) for @xmath261 we get @xmath262 it is interesting to note that the dependence on @xmath144 , @xmath138 , and @xmath139 is dropped out from eq.([adsorbate2 ] ) . however ,",
    "eq.([adsorbate1 ] ) is only valid when there are acoustic vibrations in the adsorbed layer . for cs adsorbed on cu(100 ) surface the acoustic vibrations exist only for @xmath263 @xcite .",
    "the friction coefficient for the atomic force microscope can be estimated using approximate eq.([approx ] ) . using eq.([adsorbate2 ] ) for a cylindrical tip",
    "we get @xmath264 where @xmath265 is the radius of the curvature of the tip and @xmath247 is its width . in the case of cs adsorbed on cu(100 ) surface the damping constant @xmath266s@xmath158 and @xmath267 @xcite . than for @xmath268 m , @xmath249 m , @xmath269 k at @xmath0 nm we get @xmath270kg / s , that is only three times smaller than the friction observed in @xcite at the same distance",
    ". however van der waals friction is characterized by much stronger distance dependence ( @xmath271 ) than in experiment ( @xmath272 , where @xmath273 ) . thus at smaller distances",
    "the van der waals friction will be much larger than friction observed in @xcite and can be measured experimentally .",
    "fig.7 shows the friction coefficient between the copper tip and the copper substrate as a function of the separation @xmath8 , when the surfaces of the tip and the substrate are covered by low concentration of the cs atoms and for the clean surfaces . in comparison ,",
    "the friction between two clean surfaces at the separation @xmath35 nm is eleven orders of the magnitude smaller .",
    "however , the friction between clean surfaces shown in fig.(7 ) was calculated in local optic approximation . for parallel relative motion",
    "the non - local optic effects are very important ( see fig.5 ) and when these non - local optic effects are taken into account the friction between adsorbate covered surfaces at @xmath35 nm will be by seven orders of magnitude larger than the friction between clean surfaces in parallel relative motion .",
    "we have studied how the radiative heat transfer and van der waals friction between two bodies depends on the dielectric properties of the media .",
    "we have found that , at short distances between the bodies , the thermal flux can be significantly enhanced in comparison with the black body radiation , in particular when the material involved can support low - frequency adsorbate vibrational modes , or surface plasmon modes , or the conductivity of the metals is chosen to optimize the heat transfer .",
    "this fact can be used in the scanning probe microscopy for local heating and modification of surfaces .",
    "we have shown that the van der waals friction can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude in the case of resonant photon tunneling between low- frequency surface plasmon modes and adsorbate vibrational modes . in the case of friction between two cu(100 ) surfaces covered by a low concentration of cesium atoms at @xmath0 nm we have found the friction to be of the same order of the magnitude as it was observed in experiment @xcite .",
    "however , the van der waals friction is characterized by stronger distance dependence than the friction observed in experiment .",
    "thus at small distances the van der waals friction can be much larger than the friction observed in @xcite and can be measured experimentally .",
    "this effect can be important technologically for ultrasensitive force registration and from basic point of view .",
    "the friction observed in @xcite can be explained by _ electrostatic _",
    "friction @xcite when the electromagnetic field in the vacuum gap is mediated by bias voltage or by inhomogeneities of the surfaces .",
