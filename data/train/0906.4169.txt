    "4u 1626@xmath067 is an accretion powered x - ray pulsar which was discovered with the _ uhuru _ satellite in 1972 ( giacconi et al . 1972 ) .",
    "the 7.7s x - ray pulsations were discovered by rappaport et al .",
    "( 1977 ) during sas3 observations and have been extensively monitored since then . initially the pulsar was found to be spinning up with a characteristic timescale of @xmath45000 years .",
    "it underwent an abrupt torque reversal in 1990 and has been steadily spinning down since then ( chakrabarty et al . 1997 , krauss et al . 2007 ) .",
    "optical counterpart of the pulsar was identified as kz tra , a faint blue star with little reddening ( mcclintock et al .",
    "1977 ; bradt @xmath5 mcclintock 1983 ) .",
    "pulsations at 130 mhz have also been detected from the reprocessed optical emission ( middleditch et al .",
    "multiple sidebands separated by about 0.4 mhz , are present in the power spectrum of the optical light curve , which was interpreted as signature of an orbital period of @xmath442 min ( middleditch et al .",
    "1981 ; chakrabarty et al .",
    "2001 ) . but",
    "despite extensive searches , an orbital motion of the neutron star ( usually observed in binary pulsars in the form of doppler shift in the pulse period , or delay in the pulse arrival time ) has never been detected in this source ( rappaport et al .",
    "1977 ; levine et al . 1988",
    "; jain et al . 2007 ) .",
    "it is believed that the neutron star most probably , has a low mass binary companion and is in a nearly face - on orbit .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of 4u 1626@xmath067 was first studied in detail with the _ asca _ spectrometers ( angelini et al .",
    "1995 ) and later with instruments on board _ beppo - sax _ ( owens et al . 1997 ; orlandini et al .",
    "1998 ) , _ chandra _ ( schulz et al . 2001 ) and _ xmm@xmath0newton _ ( krauss et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the x - ray continuum spectrum is evidently correlated with the torque state . during the 1977@xmath01990 spin - up phase ,",
    "the spectrum was well described by an absorbed blackbody , a power law and a high energy cutoff ( pravdo et al .",
    "1979 ; kii et al .",
    "but after the torque reversal in 1990 , the time - averaged x - ray spectrum was found to be relatively harder ( vaughan @xmath5 kitamoto 1997 , yi @xmath5 vishniac 1999 ) .",
    "orlandini et al .",
    "( 1998 ) reported an absorption feature at @xmath437 kev which they attributed to be the cyclotron absorption line .",
    "the spectrum is rich in bright hydrogen - like and helium - like oxygen and neon emission lines .",
    "the blue and red doppler shifted emission lines in the x - ray spectrum indicate that the lines originate in the accretion disk .",
    "however , presence of the red and blue doppler shifted emission lines from the accretion disk is difficult to explain if the binary system is face - on .",
    "presence of a metal rich accretion disk and absence of orbital motion led jain et al .",
    "( 2007 ) to suggest that 4u 1626@xmath067 is a candidate for a neutron star with a supernova fallback accretion disk .",
    "an important signature of the presence of an accretion disk is the detection of quasi periodic oscillations ( qpos ) in the power spectrum of the x - ray pulsar .",
    "qpos are believed to arise due to inhomogeneities in the inner accretion disk .",
    "this aperiodic x - ray variability has been detected in several x - ray sources , such as , cen x-3 ( takeshima et al .",
    "1991 ; raichur @xmath5 paul 2008 ) , xte j1858@xmath6034 ( paul @xmath5 rao 1998 ; mukherjee et al . 2006 ) , exo 2030@xmath6375 ( angelini , stella @xmath5 parmar 1989 ) , xte j0111.2@xmath07317 ( kaur et al . 2007 ) and 3a 0535@xmath6262 ( finger , wilson @xmath5 harmon 1996 ) .",
    "4u 1626@xmath067 is a unique x - ray pulsar in which qpos have been consistently detected in the x - ray and optical observations .",
    "the qpo frequency has been evolving over the past 22 years ( kaur et al .",
    "the qpo central frequency was found to be increasing during the spin - up phase of the pulsar , whereas , a negative trend was observed after the torque reversal . during the spin - up phase of the source",
    ", qpos were detected at a frequency of 36 mhz with the exosat data ( kaur et al .",
    "2008 ) and at 40 mhz from the _ ginga _ observations ( shinoda et al .",
    "1990 ) . during the spin - down era of the source , qpos have been reported to occur at a higher frequency of about 48 mhz from _ asca _ , _",
    "beppo_-sax , _ rxte _ , and _ xmm - newton _",
    "( angelini et al . 1995 ; owens et al . 1997 ; kommers et al . 1998 ; krauss et al .",
    "large amplitude 0.3@xmath01.2 mhz qpos were also detected in reprocessed optical emission from both ground based and hubble space telescope observations ( chakrabarty et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "recent observations with the monitoring x - ray instruments on board the _ rxte _ and _ swift _ satellites , show an increase in the x - ray intensity of 4u 1626@xmath067 . in the present work ,",
    "we have investigated the spectral and temporal properties of 4u 1626@xmath067 during the increased flux state .",
    "in particular , we have searched for pulsations and the qpo feature in the power spectrum of 4u 1626@xmath7 which was persistently present in the earlier observations .",
    "we have also studied the energy spectrum of the source during the current phase and have compared it with the earlier known spectral features .",
    "4u 1626@xmath067 is a medium intensity persistent x - ray source among the few hundred bright x - ray sources regularly monitored by the all sky monitor ( asm ) on board _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _",

    "the x - ray intensity was gradually decreasing until mjd 54500 , when an increase in the x - ray flux was noticed .",
    "the inset in figure 1 shows the expanded view near the onset of the flux enhancement .",
    "there seems to be two episodes of x - ray flux enhancement , both on timescales of @xmath4100 days .",
    "4u 1626@xmath067 was also regularly monitored by the burst alert telescope ( bat ; barthelmy et al .",

    "the observations covered the time range from mjd 53414 to mjd 54920 . a sudden increase in the x - ray flux",
    "was first reported by krimm et al .",

    "the flux change on timescales of @xmath4100 days is also clear in the _ swift_-bat light curve .",
    "we have also analysed data obtained from the proportional counter array ( pca ) and the high energy x - ray timing explorer ( hexte ) on board the _ rxte_. the pca consists of five xenon / methane proportional counter units ( pcus ) and is sensitive in the energy range of 2@xmath060 kev with an effective area of 1300@xmath06500 @xmath8 , depending on the number of pcus on ( jahoda et al .",
    "the hexte operates in the energy range 15@xmath0250 kev and consists of two clusters of phoswich scintillation detectors , each having a collecting area of 800 @xmath8 ( gruber et al .",

    "the best fit spectrum of the 1996 observation ( dotted curve ) is shown with the spectrum generated from the 2008 observations .",
    "the bottom panel in the figure gives the ratio between the two spectra .",
    "it is clear that there is an excess soft - photon emission in the spectrum generated from the 2008 observations .",
    "the powerlaw photon index has also increased during the recent observation .",
    "4u 1626@xmath067 is a unique system in which the x - ray flux has been gradually decreasing over the past @xmath430 years . since the discovery of x - ray pulsations in 1977 ,",
    "the source has shown a smooth spin evolution history .",
    "initially , it was found to be spinning up with a characteristic timescale of 5000 yr , but after an abrupt torque reversal , the neutron star started spinning down at about the same rate ( chakrabarty et al . 1997 ; krauss et al .",
    "the recent flux enhancement has opened up many questions regarding the stability of the accretion disk .",
    "we have found a sudden increase in the x - ray flux of 4u 1626@xmath067 , which could have also caused significant changes in the geometry of the accretion column .",
    "the power spectra of x - ray pulsars consist of narrow peaks originating from the periodic signal and its harmonic lines which are often accompanied with aperiodic features like broad bumps , wiggles and steep low frequency excess ( wijnands @xmath5 van der klis 1999 ) .",
    "the periodic variabilites arise due to the rotation induced motion of the accretion column , through which the infalling matter is funneled towards the magnetic poles of the neutron star . whereas , any instability in the emissivity of the accretion column , can give rise to an aperiodic variability ( burderi et al . 1997 ) .",
    "if the inhomogeneities occur far away from the surface of the neutron star , then the periodic and aperiodic variations occur independent of each other ( angelini et al . 1989 ) .",
    "but if the aperiodic variability occurs near the accretion column , then they are modulated at the pulsar spin frequency ( makishima et al .",
    "lazzati @xmath5 stella ( 1997 ) found a significant coupling between the aperiodic and periodic variabilities in vela x-1 and 4u 1145@xmath062 .",
    "a significant coupling was also reported in the accretion powered millisecond binary pulsar sax j1808.4@xmath03658 ( menna et al .",
    "2003 ) , her x-1 ( moon @xmath5 eikenberry 2001 ) and cen x-3 ( raichur @xmath5 paul 2008 ) .",
    "the coupling between the aperiodic and periodic variations is expected to alter the shape of the power spectrum because of the convolution of the two signals ( burderi , robba @xmath5 cusumano 1993 ) .",
    "the coupling results in a broadening of the base of the power spectrum peaks , as if , the peaks are riding on a qpo .",
    "x - ray spectrum and rapid x - ray variability of accreting compact objects have a common origin and are therefore expected to be correlated . in the case of 4u 1626@xmath067 , yi @xmath5 vishniac ( 1999 ) had found that the torque reversal in 1990 was accompanied by spectral transition and a change in the luminosity . during the spin - up phase of 4u 1626@xmath067 ,",
    "the phase averaged spectrum was well fit by a blackbody temperature _ _ k__t of @xmath40.6 and a powerlaw photon index of @xmath41 ( pravdo et al .",
    "1979 ; kii et al .",
    "vaughan @xmath5 kitamoto ( 1997 ) found that the spin transition had a significant effect on the 2@xmath010 kev energy spectrum .",
    "the powerlaw photon index changed from 1.6 ( pravdo et al .",
    "1979 ) to @xmath40.6 ( owens et al .",
    "the blackbody temperature also decreased from @xmath40.6 kev to @xmath40.3 kev .",
    "we have found similar spectral transition in the present high flux state of the source .",
    "the spectral parameters derived during the present high flux state are similar to those determined during the earlier spin - up phase .",
