    "several chiral liquid crystal ( lc ) compounds have found to exhibit intermediate subphases , smc@xmath0 ( also called smc@xmath1 ) , smc@xmath2 ( also called af ) , and other ferrielectric phases ( fi@xmath3 , fi@xmath4 and fi ) between ferroelectric smc@xmath5 and antiferroelectric smc@xmath6 phases  @xcite .",
    "all these phases are tilted smectic phases and they have approximately the same tilt angle from the layer normal .",
    "each phase consists of a helical stack of unit - set - of - layers ( unit cells ) ; the helix pitch is typically on the order of several @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "structures of smc@xmath8 , smc@xmath0 and smc@xmath2 among those are well - known  @xcite : the unit cells characterizing smc@xmath5 , smc@xmath8 , smc@xmath0 , and smc@xmath2 consist of 1 , 2 , and 3 , 4 layers , respectively .",
    "the early experiments  @xcite have identified that the @xmath9-directors ( the projection of a director onto layer - plane ) of neighboring layers are parallel or antiparallel . this experimental result indicates that the system can be described with an ising model .",
    "in fact , it has shown that an axial next nearest neighbor ising ( annni ) model , which has competing interactions , exhibits infinitely many subphases and can reproduce the transition sequence shown in experiments  @xcite .",
    "however , the assumption of the ising symmetry on these lc systems is unnatural . in practice ,",
    "the @xmath9-directors of layers are proved to deviate slightly from the parallel - antiparallel configuration by later high - resolution experiments  @xcite . in this",
    "context , various phenomenological theories have been carried out to clarify the transition phenomena of the intermediate phases  @xcite . in these models a continuous rotational freedom of tilt direction is taken into account . to a greater or less extent , these models are generalization of annni model and the models are called axial next - nearest - neighbor xy ( annnxy ) models . although the annnxy model exhibits infinitely many subphases , the system does not undergo discrete transitions between these subphases but continuously changes . by introducing an external aligning field on annnxy model , the transitions between subphases are shown to be recovered  @xcite . however such external field is artificial and its origin is ambiguous .    as a more realistic model applicable to the antiferroelectric materials ,",
    "the annnxy model with a biquadratic interaction has been introduced and introductory remarks on the crossover from xy character to ising character are given  @xcite . in the present paper , we investigate the annnxy model with the biquadratic interaction and disclose general properties of this model .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we introduce a hamiltonian of the annnxy model with a biquadratic interaction as @xmath10 @xmath11 ,   \\label{eq : hamiltonian}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where the @xmath12 denotes the azimuthal angle of a molecule @xmath13 in @xmath14-th layer .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 is the interaction parameter between molecules belonging to the same layer .",
    "the summation in the first term of eq .",
    "is done over all neighboring pairs in the @xmath14-th layer .",
    "the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the interaction parameters between molecules in the nearest neighboring layers and next nearest neighboring layers , respectively .",
    "let @xmath16 be positive without loss of generality since the transformation @xmath18 followed by @xmath19 leaves the above hamiltonian invariant . in the following , we set @xmath17 to be negative .",
    "the last term of eq . is the biquadratic interaction with an interaction parameter @xmath20 .",
    "this biquadratic interaction term stabilizes the parallel and antiparallel configuration of @xmath9-directors .",
    "this hamiltonian can be viewed as a truncated fourier approximation of an exact hamiltonian .",
    "our model turns to the ordinary annnxy model for vanishing value of @xmath21 . in the limit of @xmath22",
    ", it turns to the annni model .",
    "thus for sufficiently large @xmath21 the ordered phase has parallel and antiparallel @xmath9-directors ; we call such phases ising symmetric phases .",
    "we call the other phases xy symmetric phases .    in the present paper ,",
    "we ignore the helical structure of the chiral smectic phases , and assume these phases as simple periodic repetitions of unit cells .",
    "thus a smectic phase is characterized by a set of order parameters in the unit cell , and may be labeled with its wavenumber @xmath23 .",
    "we note that the transformation @xmath24 results in @xmath25 .",
    "thus , e.g. , @xmath26 ( smc@xmath0 ) and @xmath27 ( smc@xmath28 ) phases under negative @xmath16 correspond , respectively , to @xmath29 and @xmath30 phases under positive @xmath16 .    at zero temperature ,",
    "there are three stable phases  @xcite : @xmath30 phase , @xmath31 phase , and a phase q in which the wave number changes continuously in the range @xmath32 .",
    "the phase diagram for temperature @xmath33 is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : k0phasediagram ] . in the phase @xmath31 ,",
    "irrespective of the value @xmath21 , the azimuthal angles in a unit cell can be written as @xmath34 and @xmath35 , i.e. , this phase has ising symmetry .",
    "the stable distribution of azimuthal angle in phase q is @xmath36 , and the stable wave number is determined by interaction parameters as @xmath37 .",
    "in this section , we investigate the stability of phases at finite temperature within the mean field approximation . we choose the order parameters of @xmath14-th layer as @xmath38 where the angular brackets indicate a thermal average over all molecules in a single layer .",
    "we can assume , without loss of generality , that in ising symmetric phases the @xmath9-directors are parallel to @xmath39-axis and thus @xmath40 .",
    "the mean fields due to these order parameters are @xmath41 , \\\\",
    "\\eta_{l } & = \\beta \\left[jzs_{l } + j_{1}(s_{l-1 } + s_{l+1 } )                           + j_{2}(s_{l-2 } + s_{l+2})\\right],\\\\    \\mu_{l }   & = \\beta k(c_{l-1 } + c_{l+1}),\\\\    \\nu_{l }   & = \\beta k(s_{l-1 } + s_{l+1 } ) ,   \\end{split } \\label{eq : meanfield}\\ ] ] where we assumed that each molecule interacts @xmath42 molecules in the same layer , one molecule in each of the two nearest neighboring layers , and one molecule in each of the two next nearest neighboring layers .",
    "we can derive the mean field free energy per layer  @xcite using the above order parameters and mean fields as @xmath43 , \\label{eq : freeenergy}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is a period ( number of layers in a unit cell ) .",
    "the function @xmath45 in the last term of eq . is the one - molecule partition function defined as @xmath46 from the derivatives of the free energy with respect to the mean fields , we obtain a set of self - consistent equations : @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 in the right - hand sides are functions of order parameters defined in eqs .. one of the solutions of eqs . which minimizes the free energy gives a set of order parameters of the thermodynamically stable state .",
    "the transition temperature between ordered and disordered phases is @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are , respectively , @xmath55 with the @xmath56-th order modified bessel functions @xmath57 .",
    "the variable @xmath58 is a solution of @xmath59 thus @xmath60 is given by solving eqs . and self - consistently .",
    "the above critical temperature is derived  @xcite , under the assumption that the transition is second - order , by expanding the free energy @xmath61 around @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and letting the quadratic terms of the expansion vanish at critical temperature .",
    "the order - disorder transition temperature deviates from eq .",
    "if the transition is first - order .",
    "indeed , as we will see below , the transition temperature is slightly higher than @xmath60 when @xmath21 is comparable to @xmath60 .    in the following ,",
    "we restrict our consideration to a set of _ major _ ordered phases with wavenumbers @xmath30 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and a disordered phase . since we discuss the relative stability of these phases rather than infinitely many phases , the resulting phase diagrams should be viewed as rough approximations of correct phase diagrams .",
    "however , we can expect , from the analogy of annni model , that other than the above six phases will occupy relatively small regions on the phase diagrams , and that we can safely ignore these minor phases .    in order to reduce the number of order parameters",
    ", we make a reasonable assumption that the ordered phases are highly symmetric . in precise , when the period @xmath44 is odd ( i.e. , @xmath69 in this paper ) , we assume that a set of @xmath9-directors of a unit cell has mirror symmetry with respect to a plane perpendicular to the smectic layers ; when @xmath44 is even , we assume a two - fold rotational symmetry of the set of @xmath9-directors , in addition to the mirror symmetry .    in the following calculation , we set @xmath70 and @xmath71 . we take @xmath72 as the unit of energy .",
    "each ordered phase has a set of ( reduced number of ) self - consistent equations .",
    "we solved the sets of equations numerically , and determined the thermodynamic stable phase by comparing the free energy per molecule .      at @xmath73",
    ", our model is reduced to an ordinary annnxy model",
    ". then the system transits through the phases of @xmath74 continuously  @xcite and thus the successive phase transitions are never observed .",
    "we show the phase diagram for @xmath73 in fig .",
    "[ fig : k0phasediagram ] , in which we considered the relative stability of @xmath30 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 phases .",
    "-@xmath16 plane for @xmath73 .",
    "each fractional number indicates the wavenumber @xmath23 of relatively stable phase , and d denotes a disordered phase .",
    "the shaded areas indicate the phases with xy symmetry , where non - vanishing @xmath75 and @xmath76 are allowed ; while the unshaded areas with @xmath30 and @xmath68 indicate the phases with ising symmetry , where @xmath40 .",
    "the inset is the phase diagram in the @xmath21-@xmath16 plane for zero temperature .",
    "the wavenumber of the phase q continuously changes from 0 to 1/4 . ]",
    "the phases with @xmath77 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 have xy symmetry , while @xmath30 and @xmath68 phases have ising symmetry .",
    "it seems there is a contradiction between @xmath21-@xmath16 diagram ( inset ) and @xmath78-@xmath16 diagram at @xmath73 and @xmath33 , i.e. , stable regions of @xmath30 and @xmath68 phases are overestimated in @xmath78-@xmath16 diagram ; such a contradiction , which can be observed in all the following phase diagrams , is due to our approximation in which infinitely many minor phases are ignored .",
    "since the effect of the biquadratic interaction stabilizes the ising symmetric phases , @xmath30 and @xmath68 phases dominate larger regions as @xmath21 increases .",
    "the phase diagram for @xmath79 , fig .",
    "[ fig : k02phasediagram ] , shows that the ising symmetric phases spread from the lower - temperature region .",
    "but for @xmath79 .",
    "]    the phases with @xmath77 , @xmath29 , and @xmath80 still have xy symmetry .",
    "when @xmath81 exceeds @xmath82 , the phases with @xmath32 vanish for any @xmath16 at zero - temperature ( see the inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : k0phasediagram ] ) .",
    "the phases with @xmath77 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 change qualitatively at this stage . in these phases , ising symmetric phases appear at lower temperature region and the ising symmetric regions expand as @xmath21 increases .",
    "figure  [ fig : k10phasediagram ] is a phase diagram for @xmath83 .",
    "but for @xmath83 . the phases with @xmath29 and @xmath67 exhibit ising symmetric phases .",
    "the broken line indicates the boundary between xy symmetric phases and ising symmetric phases .",
    "( inset ) : the order parameter ratio @xmath84 of @xmath29 phase as a function of temperature at @xmath85 around the xy - ising transition temperature . ]    in this phase diagram , we can clearly observe the cross - over from xy symmetric phases to ising symmetric phases .",
    "figure  [ fig : k30phasediagram ] shows the phase diagram for @xmath86 .",
    "but for @xmath86 .",
    "the xy symmetric phase remains only in @xmath77 phase .",
    "the dotted line around @xmath87 and @xmath88 is @xmath60 defined in eq .. the order(@xmath31)-disorder transition temperature ( indicated by solid line ) is slightly higher than the @xmath60 and the transition is first - order in the region where @xmath21 and @xmath89 are comparable . ]    the ising symmetric phases are spread out almost the whole region .",
    "this figure also shows a difference from figs .",
    "[ fig : k0phasediagram ] , [ fig : k02phasediagram ] and [ fig : k10phasediagram ] in the order - disorder transition temperature .",
    "the temperature @xmath60 ( the order - disorder transition temperature under the assumption of the second - order transition ) deviates from @xmath53 when @xmath21 exceeds unity ( see eqs . and ) ; the deviation arises from the region where @xmath90",
    ". however the @xmath60 does not give correct order - disorder transition temperature .",
    "in fact , the actual transition temperature is slightly higher than the calculated @xmath60 in the region where @xmath21 and @xmath89 are comparable , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : k30phasediagram ] .",
    "this fact indicates that the order - disorder transition is first - order , rather than second - order .",
    "indeed , we observed that the order parameters changes discontinuously at the region where the order - disorder transition temperature is different from @xmath60 .",
    "we studied the transition behavior of annnxy model with biquadratic interaction which can be applicable to the successive phase transitions of antiferroelectric smectics ; the biquadratic interaction is interpreted as the second fourier component of a pair directional interaction .",
    "the crossover from the xy symmetry to the ising one is identified for several representative phases .",
    "the ising symmetric phase has been suggested to appear from the low temperature region as the strength of biquadratic interaction is increased  @xcite . at the xy symmetric phase with period @xmath44 , the difference of tilt directions of directors in successive layers , @xmath91 , is shown to be @xmath92 , which indicates a simple helical structure .",
    "our results show that the annnxy model with biquadratic interaction reproduce the phase sequence observed in the experiments .",
    "however , we may not expect the quantitative agreement with experiments . as an example , let us consider the lc molecules in @xmath29 phase , which is essentially equivalent to @xmath26 phase for negative @xmath16 , and thus this phase corresponds to the 3-layer smc@xmath0 .",
    "ellipsometric experiments have shown that @xmath9-directors of this phase do approximately but not exactly lie in a co - plain  @xcite . in precise ,",
    "the azimuthal angles of molecules in a period are @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 , with @xmath96rad ( @xmath97 ) . in terms of our model",
    ", this fact corresponds to the situation where @xmath98 .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : k10phasediagram ] shows a typical behavior of @xmath99 in @xmath29 phase at the xy - ising transition temperature . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : k10phasediagram ] , the ratio @xmath99 is rather large(@xmath100 ) at high temperature and approximately zero at low temperature ; we can not find any region where @xmath101 is comparable to the experimental results .",
    "for quantitative agreement of the present results with experimental ones , some additional modification to the present model is required .",
    "we may expect to obtain quantitatively reliable results by introducing a chiral interaction together with long range interactions  @xcite , as done by olson _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite to explain the @xmath94 in the framework of phenomenological free energy .    the profile of phase diagram for ising symmetric phases in fig .",
    "[ fig : k30phasediagram ] suggests apparently a character of devil s staircase  @xcite and thus the system undergoes successive phase transitions . for phases of xy symmetry in figs .",
    "[ fig : k02phasediagram ] and [ fig : k10phasediagram ] , however , it is not clear from our present analysis whether the system exhibits the successive phase transitions or not .",
    "analysis of the stability of the soliton excitation can be a powerful tool to certify the successive transitions between xy symmetric phases . in the annnxy model under the two - fold external field ,",
    "the character of devil s staircase is certified even in the ground state  @xcite . however , in the present model , the phase changes continuously at the ground state for small biquadratic interaction as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : k0phasediagram ] . in this respect ,",
    "the phase boundary of main phase should be studied at finite temperature , which will disclose the character of successive phase transitions .",
