    "many elliptical galaxies show significant signatures of triaxiality ( e.g. de zeeuw et al . 2002 ) .",
    "therefore , we have extended schwarzschild s orbit superposition method to construct realistic triaxial dynamical models , which fit the observed surface brightness , as well as ( two - dimensional ) kinematical measurements of elliptical galaxies ( verolme et al .",
    "this fully numerical method is , however , too computationally expensive to do a full search over the model parameters , such as mass - to - light ratio , black hole mass , viewing direction and intrinsic shape .",
    "approximating the potential by one of stckel form , we can construct velocity and velocity dispersion fields using the analytical solution of the continuity equation and the three jeans equations ( statler 1994 , van de ven et al .",
    "2003 ) , and compare them with observations to constrain the large parameter range . within this",
    "reduced parameter space , we can then apply the extended schwarzschild method using the true potential , to find the true best - fitting triaxial model .",
    "schwarzschild s method not only provides the best - fitting parameters , but also results in an orbital weight distribution , which after appropriate smoothing allows us to study the orbital structure of the observed galaxy .",
    "to investigate the robustness of the derived internal structure , we are applying our method to theoretical models with known distribution function ( df ) .",
    "we use abel models ( dejonghe & laurent 1991 ; mathieu & dejonghe 1999 ) , for which the potential is assumed to be of stckel form and the df to be a function of a single parameter @xmath0 , with @xmath1 a linear combination of the explicitly known integrals of motion . the density and higher velocity moments can be calculated efficiently . besides this analytical simplicity , the abel models have , with the choice of a three - integral df , enough freedom to incorporate many of the observed triaxial features ( figure 1 ) .",
