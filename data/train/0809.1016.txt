    "improved understanding of the process of folding of rna finds its ultimate use in the prediction of the fully folded , partially folded and completely unfolded structures under physiological conditions @xcite . under these conditions , unfolding is a very slow process as compared to folding in the presence of a force .",
    "application of a force increases the unfolding rate and we can therefore get the unfolded structures from the folded ones ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "experimental techniques of force induced measurements have proved successful in probing properties related to different aspects of rna folding and unfolding , domain unfolding in proteins , in polysachharides and nucleic acids ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "experiments have been performed on the double helixed dnas to study their elastic and structural properties using electric field , hydrodynamic flow among other methods of force application ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the advent of afm technique served as an important tool in the study of the basic underlying framework of molecular structural biology . over the years , optical tweezers and afm ( atomic force microscopy ) techniques",
    "have been employed to study the physical , elastic and structural properties of the biomolecules by recording their force extension curves ( fecs ) and studying the force dependent dynamics and folding landscapes of the molecules ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the conformations of biopolymers ( dna , rna and proteins ) which are otherwise not accesible from the conventional methods of measurements : nmr spectroscopy and x - ray crystallography , are possible with the use of afms .",
    "these conformations help in revealing the underlying mechanical framework of the biological systems ( @xcite and references therein ) . mechanical unfolding and refolding of single rna has been studied using force - ramp , hopping and force - jump methods ( @xcite and references therein ) . in mechanical unfolding experiments , it has been observed that at a critical value of the applied force , the hairpin structure toggles between the folded and the unfolded states @xcite . in these experiments , ionic concentrations play an important role .",
    "experiments of bustamante _ et al _ @xcite have shown that the denaturation of rna by a constant force involves multiple trajectories ( for rna hairpins and tetrahymena thermophila ribozyme ) while undergoing a transition from the folded structure state to the unfolded state .",
    "these trajectories depend on the point at which the force is applied @xcite .",
    "this diverseness in the folding - unfolding pathways is due to the rugged energy landscape of rna ( consisting of many minima ) .",
    "controlled / monitored force loading and unloading rates can be used to manipulate the single molecules of rna into either their native or misfolded pathways .",
    "different force unloading rates in experiments on tar rna molecules showed different types of trajectories associated with particular refolding characteristics ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we discuss here very briefly , a generalization of the extended random matrix model of rna folding proposed in @xcite where the external perturbation acts on a single nucleotide ( @xmath3 ) and on n nucleotides ( @xmath14 ) in the polymer chain ( we will refer to the two rna models as 1-np rna model , with np being nucleotide perturbation and n - np rna model respectively ) . in @xcite , the external perturbation acted on all the nucleotides in the polymer chain ( _ i.e. , _ @xmath2 , n is the number of bases on which the force is acting ) .",
    "we briskly outline the extended matrix model of @xcite for completeness and understanding and follow it up with results and comparative discussion for the 1-np and n - np models .",
    "further , we present a detailed numerical analysis for the asymptotics of the extended matrix model of rna with perturbation on all the nucleotides in the polymer chain .",
    "the genus distribution functions : the total number of diagrams at a fixed length l but independent of genus g , @xmath10 and the number of diagrams at a fixed length l and genus g , @xmath5 of the matrix model of rna in @xcite are found to change in the presence of the external perturbation .",
    "we extend our numerical asymptotic analysis to the n - np rna model as well .",
    "we review here , the effect when a perturbation acts on all the nucleotides in the polymer chain ( @xmath2 ) studied in @xcite .",
    "the nucleotide - nucleotide interaction partition function of the polymer chain with a perturbation on all the bases is    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the normalization constant , @xmath17 is the perturbation term , @xmath18 is an ( l@xmath19l ) symmetric matrix containing information on the interactions between the l nucleotides at positions i and j in the polymer chain , @xmath20 are l independent ( n@xmath19n ) hermitian matrices and the observable @xmath21 is an ordered product over @xmath20 s .",
    "we consider @xmath22 and @xmath23 where v gives the strength of interaction between the nucleotides at positions i and j ( in these models , interaction between any two nucleotides of the chain is considered the same and equal to v ) and w gives the strength of the perturbation . carrying out a series of hubbard stratonovich transformations , the integral over l matrices @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( [ eq.1 ] ) reduces to an integral over a single ( n@xmath19n ) hermitian matrix @xmath24    @xmath25    where @xmath26 .",

    "reduces to the random matrix model in @xcite .",
    "however , for @xmath32 it is observed that the partition function for odd lengths of the polymer chain vanishes completely . in the extended matrix model , each unpaired base of the polymer chain in the contact diagrams",
    "is associated with a factor @xmath33 which becomes zero when @xmath34 thus removing structures with any unpaired bases .",
    "we can therefore divide the structures into two regimes : ( i ) @xmath35 comprising of both the unpaired and paired base structures and ( ii ) @xmath34 comprising of only completely paired base structures ( where only structures with fully paired bases remain whereas structures with any unpaired bases are suppressed ) @xcite .",
    "the genus distributions for the extended matrix model are therefore significantly different for different @xmath1 s , especially for @xmath34 [ where @xmath36 for odd lengths of the polymer chain ] as compared with the model of @xcite .",
    "the addition of a perturbation has thus changed the genus distributions and the overall enumeration of the structures given by this model .",
    "we now consider a generalization of the extended matrix model proposed in @xcite by adding a perturbation to a single nucleotide in the polymer chain only , @xmath3 ( 1-np ) .",
    "the motivation comes from the force induced experiments in obtaining important characteristics of folding and unfolding of rnas discussed in the introduction @xcite .",
    "we keep all the assumptions the same as for the model in @xcite .",
    "the interaction partition function @xmath28 for 1-np will be given by eq .",
    "( [ eq.1 ] ) with the perturbation term now being @xmath37 and the normalization constant given by @xmath38=@xmath39 . carrying out a similar mathematical analysis employed in going from eq .",

    "( 3 ) with the only difference being that @xmath1 in eq . ( 3 ) gets replaced by @xmath40 for the 1-np .",
    "this implies that when @xmath41 _ i.e. _ , no perturbation is acting , we get the matrix model of @xcite . when @xmath42 , we get the extended matrix model with perturbation on all the bases @xcite .",
    "the 1-np partition functions @xmath28 for different l can be found exactly from the exponential generating function [ eq .  ( [ eq.3 ] ) with @xmath1 being replaced by @xmath40 ] by equating the coefficients of powers of t on both the sides of the equation . in general , if the number of bases with the perturbation is n then @xmath1 is replaced by @xmath44 . when @xmath2 , we get the extended matrix model with perturbation on all the bases , discussed briefly here , [ eq .",

    "the asymptotic behaviour of the genus distribution functions for the matrix model of rna studied in @xcite showed universal characteristics .",
    "we investigate here numerically , the changes that the genus distribution functions : ( i ) the total number of diagrams at a fixed length l but independent of genus g , @xmath10 [ defined as @xmath10=@xmath46 and ( ii ) the number of diagrams at a fixed length l and genus g , @xmath5 [ defined through @xmath47=@xmath48 of the model in @xcite undergo when a perturbation is added to these models .",
