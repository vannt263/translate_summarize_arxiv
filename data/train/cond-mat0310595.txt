    "long josephson junctions ( jjs ) are well known to be a unique physical system that allows one to experimentally study dynamics of topological solitons in the form of fluxons ( alias josephson vortices , each carrying a magnetic - flux quantum @xmath3 ) @xcite . for both experimental and theoretical studies ,",
    "the most convenient object is an _ annular _ ( circular ) long jj , in which the net number of initially trapped fluxons is conserved , hence new solitons may only be created as fluxon - antifluxon pairs @xcite .",
    "fluxon dynamics in the annular junctions manifests itself in the clearest way , as it is not complicated by reflections from boundaries .",
    "the interest to annular long jjs stems from the great potential they offer for fundamental studies of dynamical properties of solitons , such as , e.g. , emission of the cherenkov radiation @xcite .",
    "a challenging problem for the theory is quantum soliton dynamics in long jjs , which has been recently observed in experiment at ultra - low temperatures @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "annular jjs offer applications in cryoelectronics , such as sources of highly coherent microwave radiation @xcite and radiation detectors @xcite .",
    "besides that , long annular jjs have a potential for designing fluxon qubits @xcite and fluxon ratchets @xcite .",
    "a key problem in experiments with annular jjs is the trapping of a desired number of fluxons .",
    "the only previously known method which made it possible to do that in a controllable way is rather complicated , relying upon the use of a scanning electron ( or laser ) microscope @xcite .",
    "other studies relied on fluxon trapping in the course of cooling the system below the critical temperature @xmath4 of the superconducting electrodes @xcite",
    ". however , the latter technique does not provide for reproducible results , and requires heating of the junction to high temperatures .",
    "moreover , trapped fluxons generated in such a manner get often pinned by abrikosov vortices , which may be trapped in the electrodes in the course of cooling below @xmath4 .",
    "in a recent work @xcite , a new method to insert fluxons into annular jjs was proposed and demonstrated experimentally and numerically .",
    "it is based on injecting a relatively large current @xmath5 into the junction locally ; the current flows from the injection point into the superconducting electrode and also across the josephson barrier , and is collected back at another point of the same electrode , which is separated from the injection spot by a small distance @xmath6 .",
    "the schematic view of such jj is given in fig .",
    "[ idea ] . in the following ,",
    "we use the normalized notation for the distance between the current injectors , @xmath7 , and the current , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the josephson penetration depth .    in this",
    "setting , one is actually dealing with a _ current dipole _ , the total current traversing the josephson barrier being zero .",
    "the dipole gives rise to a local magnetic flux @xmath10 in the region between the injection and collection points .",
    "if the magnitude of this pinned flux attains the flux quantum @xmath3 , it may become energetically favorable ( in the presence of an additional dc bias current uniformly distributed along the junction ) to have the pinned flux compensated by a negative flux @xmath11 .",
    "in fact , this implies that a fluxon - antifluxon pair is created in the annular jj , so that the antifluxon carrying the flux @xmath11 is pinned by the current dipole , while elsewhere in the long junction there appears a free fluxon carrying the compensating flux @xmath3 .",
    "further , if @xmath10 exceeds @xmath12 , then @xmath2 free fluxons are expected to appear in the annular jj .     into one of the superconducting electrodes.,width=192 ]",
    "one objective of this work is to theoretically analyze the above problem and find a critical condition for the generation of free fluxons by the current dipole in a long jj biased by the uniformly distributed dc bias current @xmath13 .",
    "results will be obtained in an exact analytical form ( in section ii ) for the case when the dipole strength @xmath14 is finite , while @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "two different solutions will be obtained .",
    "one of them yields a critical value of @xmath13 which coincides with the fraunhofer expression ( see below ) , that was recently found as a condition for the transition into a resistive state in a short annular jj , whose full length was assumed to be much smaller than @xmath9 @xcite . in our solution , the length of the ring junction may be arbitrarily large .",
    "thus , we demonstrate that the fraunhofer formula for the critical bias current is a _",
    "one , which is valid irrespective of the dipole strength and junction s length .",
    "the second analytical solution reported in this paper is exact only for long junctions .",
    "it yields the critical value of @xmath13 which is slightly smaller than the one given by the first solution .",
    "however , the configuration on which the second solution is based ( essentially , it is a fluxon - antifluxon bound state ) is , plausibly , always unstable .",
    "for this reason , the second solution may be irrelevant to the experimental technique outlined above in the usual ( classical ) regime of operation .",
    "however , precisely this second solution defines an _ instanton _ @xcite which controls the tunneling rate for quantum birth of a free fluxon , in the same long jj , at ultra - low temperatures .",
    "the instanton predicts that the exponentially small factor , which limits the quantum - birth rate , will scale as a square root of that for the long uniform junction , i.e. , the quantum yield is strongly enhanced by the current dipole .",
    "therefore , the second solution is physically meaningful too .",
    "the analytical predictions will be compared with results of direct numerical simulations of the critical condition ( in the classical situation ) .",
    "a free fluxon moving in the annular jj will periodically collide with the antifluxon pinned by the current dipole and the dipole itself .",
    "an important issue is to minimize interaction between the free fluxon and the dipole - antifluxon complex , so that the junction would seem as uniform as possible for the moving soliton . in section iii ,",
    "we demonstrate , in an approximate analytical form , that , keeping the dipole size @xmath17 and current @xmath18 finite ( or proceeding to the limit of the point - wise dipole ) , one may indeed select their values so that the interaction is strongly suppressed .",
    "this prediction , which has immediate relevance to the experiment , is also compared with direct numerical simulations .",
    "the system outlined above is described by the following perturbed sine - gordon ( sg ) equation for the superconducting phase difference @xmath19 , which is written in the standard notation @xcite : @xmath20 ,   \\label{sg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the dirac delta - function [ it is used in eq .",

    "( [ sg ] ) is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the dipole strength defined above , and @xmath27 is the derivative of the delta - function .",
    "the model ( [ dipole ] ) has been first studied almost two decades ago by aslamazov and gurovich @xcite .",
    "these authors considered interaction of fluxons with an abrikosov vortex trapped in one of the junction s electrodes , so that the vortex normal core is parallel to the tunnel barrier . later , the influence of the abrikosov vortex on the fluxon bound states localized near the junction boundary was studied by fistul and giuliani @xcite .    in the special case @xmath28 , eq .  ( [ dipole ] ) is also used as a model which describes composite long jjs including segments of @xmath29-type and @xmath30-type josephson barriers @xcite .",
    "such composite junctions can be fabricated , for example , by using zigzag barriers between @xmath31-wave and @xmath17-wave superconductors @xcite .",
    "this model gives rise to stable semi - fluxons ( @xmath30-fluxons with a semi - integer topological charge ) . as it was pointed out by goldobin _",
    "et al_. @xcite , semi - fluxons can also be created in a conventional long junction with local current injection in the form of a current dipole .",
    "the critical condition for the transition to a free moving fluxon is defined in the following way : it is necessary to find a maximum value @xmath32 of the bias current density @xmath13 such that , for given @xmath33 , static ( time - independent ) solutions to eq .",

    ", the disappearance of the static solution means the appearance of freely moving fluxon(s ) in the long jj .",
    "double integration of the static version ( @xmath37 ) of eq .",
    "( [ dipole ] ) in a vicinity of the point @xmath38 yields the following boundary conditions ( b.c . ) to be satisfied at this point : @xmath39 off the point @xmath38 , the static solution obeys the equation @xmath40 further analysis of the static problem based on eqs .",
    "( [ b.c . ] ) and ( [ static ] ) will be presented in the next subsection .    in the sg system operating in the quantum regime ( i.e. , in a long jj kept at extremely low temperatures )",
    ", fluxon - antifluxon pairs can be produced as a result of under - barrier tunneling @xcite .",
    "the corresponding tunneling rate is determined by an instanton solution , which starts with some static field configuration ( which is just a flat phase distribution , in the case of a homogenous system ) and , going in imaginary time under the energy barrier , ends up on the physical shell , with a state consisting of far separated fluxon and antifluxon . in",
    "was shown that , in the presence of local inhomogeneities , the quantum birth of fluxon - antifluxon pairs may be facilitated ( the corresponding tunneling rate being enhanced by an exponentially large factor ) if one or both solitons appear on the _ mass shell _ ( appear as real quasi - particles after completion of the tunneling ) in a state pinned by an inhomogeneity @xcite . in this connection , it is important to find a threshold @xmath41 ( a minimum value of @xmath13 ) past which there appears a state with a pinned fluxon and free antifluxon , i.e. , an effective threshold for the quantum birth of fluxons in the quantum regime .",
    "a difference from the problem of finding the above - mentioned value @xmath36 , which determines the threshold for the creation of a free fluxon in the classical regime , is that , on the way from @xmath42 to @xmath43 @xmath36 , the corresponding static solutions to eq .",
    "( [ dipole ] ) need not be stable ; just on the contrary , instanton solutions usually go through unstable states , such as fluxon - antifluxon pairs , as the evolution in imaginary time does not require stability in real time @xcite .      in the case of a finite - length annular jj",

    "coming back to the case of the long jj , we notes that a solution for @xmath71 must assume the background value ( [ phi0 ] ) ( for instance , with @xmath72 ) far from the dipole ( formally , at @xmath73 ) .",

    "@xcite ) . however , as it was explained above , the dynamical instability of the intermediate state does not bar using the configuration as a part of the under - barrier instanton trajectory .",
    "while detailed consideration of the under - barrier production of fluxons in the quantum system is beyond the scope of this work , we briefly mention that the above - mentioned instanton may be constructed , following the pattern of the critical configuration that yields the threshold value ( [ solution ] ) , as precisely a _",
