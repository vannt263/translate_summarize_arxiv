    "over the past few years rapidity gaps , i.e. pseudorapidity regions without hadronic activity , have been observed in hadronic collisions at both the hera @xmath7 collider  @xcite and in @xmath8 collisions at the fermilab tevatron  @xcite .",
    "such rapidity gaps are widely attributed to the exchange of color singlet quanta between incident partons  @xcite , the exchange of two gluons in a color singlet state being the simplest such model  @xcite . at the tevatron , a fraction @xmath9 of all dijet events with jet transverse energies @xmath10  gev and jet separations of more than three units of pseudorapidity exhibit rapidity gaps between the jets .",
    "this observation is particularly striking since it demonstrates that color singlet exchange effects in qcd events are relevant at momentum transfers of order 1,000  gev@xmath6 , raising the hope that perturbative methods can be used for quantitative descriptions .",
    "a gap fraction of order one percent was in fact predicted by bjorken  @xcite , in terms of a fraction @xmath11 of dijet events which are due to @xmath0-channel color - singlet exchange and a survival probability @xmath12 of rapidity gaps of order 10%  @xcite , [ eq : ps ] f_gap = f_s p_s . here",
    "the survival probability estimates the fraction of hard dijet events without an underlying event , i.e. without soft interactions between the other partons in the scattering hadrons .",
    "such multiple interactions would fill the rapidity gap produced in the hard scattering process .",
    "for @xmath13 elastic scattering , bjorken estimated the color - singlet fraction @xmath14 in terms of the imaginary part of the two - gluon @xmath0-channel exchange amplitude , which is known to dominate the forward scattering amplitude for @xmath0-channel color - singlet exchange . in impact parameter space , at impact parameters small",
    "compared to @xmath15 , the result is f_s^impact & = & 29    & & 12 |433 - 2n_f|^2 = 0.15 .",
    "[ eq : fbjorken ] here 2/9 is the relative color factor of the two - gluon color - singlet to the one - gluon color - octet exchange cross section and @xmath16 is an infrared cutoff parameter which regularizes the two - gluon loop - integral .",
    "this model for the calulation of the color singlet fraction @xmath14 , with the two gluon - exchange amplitude replaced by its imaginary part , will be called the two - gluon exchange model in the following .    in this model",
    ", the color singlet fraction grows with the color charge of the scattered partons . for @xmath2 and @xmath3 elastic scattering @xmath14",
    "would be larger by factors @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "this results in a substantial decrease of the observable gap fraction as the contribution from gluon induced dijet events is reduced , _",
    "e.g. _ by increasing the average transverse momentum of the observed jets and thereby the feynman-@xmath19 values of the incident partons .",
    "such measurements have recently been reported by both the cdf  @xcite and the d0  @xcite collaborations , and no such effect is observed .",
    "in fact , the d0 data are compatible with a slight increase of the gap fraction with increasing jet @xmath20 , casting doubt on the validity of the two - gluon exchange model  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we reconsider the basic ideas behind the two - gluon exchange model .",
    "we demonstrate its limitations and show that , even when starting from this perturbative picture of rapidity gap formation , the determination of the color singlet exchange fraction @xmath14 is essentially nonperturbative .",
    "we start from a basic feature of the two - gluon exchange model : unitarity fixes the imaginary part of the @xmath0-channel two - gluon exchange amplitude in terms of the born amplitude and this imaginary part dominates @xmath0-channel color singlet exchange  @xcite . rewriting this relationship in terms of phase shifts ,",
    "the one- and two - gluon exchange amplitudes are found to be too large to be compatible with unitarity .",
    "phase shift unitarization leads to a more realistic description , in which the total differential cross section remains unchanged compared to the born result , but with @xmath0-channel color singlet exchange fractions which differ substantially from the expectations of the two - gluon exchange model .",
    "these features are demonstrated analytically for fixed values of the strong coupling constant , @xmath21 , in section  [ sec2 ] . in section  [ sec3 ]",
    "we then perform a numerical analysis for running @xmath21 , showing that the key properties of the fixed-@xmath21 results remain unchanged .",
    "the predicted color singlet fractions are found to very strongly depend on the regularization of gluon exchange at small momentum transfer , however , and thus can not be reliably calculated within perturbation theory .",
    "within our unitarized model the non - perturbative effects can be summarized in terms of two parameters , the survival probability of gaps , @xmath22 , and a universal coulomb phase shift , @xmath23 .",
    "implications for the formation of gaps at the tevatron are analyzed in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "in particular we calculate how the gap fraction between two hard jets varies with jet transverse energies and jet pseudorapidity separation and then compare predicted fractions with tevatron data  @xcite .",
    "our conclusions are given in section  [ sec5 ] .",
    "consider the elastic scattering of two arbitrary partons , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , p(i_1)+p(j_1)p(i_2)+p(j_2 ) , at momentum transfer @xmath26 . here",
    "@xmath27 denote the colors of the initial and final state partons .",
    "the cross section and the partial wave amplitudes are completely dominated by the forward region , @xmath28 , where the rutherford scattering amplitude , [ eq : mborn ] m = -8_s t^at^a = 8_s f_c = m_0f_c , provides an excellent approximation .",
    "note that helicity is conserved in forward scattering , hence spin need not be considered in the following .",
    "the only process dependence arises from the color factor @xmath29 .      in order to study unitarity constraints",
    ", we need to diagonalize the amplitude in both momentum / coordinate space and in color space .",
    "the first step is most easily achieved by transforming to impact parameter space , [ eq : fourier ] t(*b * ) = ( * q * ) e^-i*q * . neglecting multi - parton production processes , _",
    "i.e. _ inelastic channels , unitarity of the @xmath30-matrix implies the relation [ eq : unitarity1 ] t(*b * ) =    @xmath31 .",
    "( [ eq : unitarity1 ] ) represents a matrix relation in color space .",
    "more fully it can be written as t(*b*)_i_2 j_2 , i_1 j_1 = _ i , j t(*b*)_i_2 j_2 , i j t^(*b*)_i j , i_1 j_1 , [ eq : unitarity2 ] where the sum runs over the dimension of the color space , @xmath32 for @xmath33 and @xmath13 scattering and @xmath34 ( 64 ) for @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) elastic scattering .    since the color factors can be written as hermitian matrices , the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : unitarity2 ] ) represents a simple matrix product of the color matrices .",
    "this product is easily diagonalized by decomposing the color factors @xmath35 into a linear combination of projection operators onto the irreducible color representations which are accessible in the @xmath36-channel , [ eq : col.factor ] f_c = ( f_c)_i_2j_2,i_1j_1 = _ k f_k ( p_k)_i_2j_2,i_1j_1 = _ k f_k p_k .",
    "for the case of quark - antiquark elastic scattering , for example , with color decomposition @xmath37 , the color factor can be written in terms of gell - mann matrices as ( f_c)_i_2j_2,i_1j_1 = ( ^a2 ) _ i_2i_1 ( ^a2 ) _",
    "j_1j_2 = 49_j_1i_1_i_2j_2- 13(^a2 ) _",
    "j_1i_1 ( ^a2 ) _",
    "i_2j_2 = 43p_1 - 16 p_8 . for all cases , @xmath13 , @xmath33 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 elastic scattering ,",
    "the decomposition into @xmath36-channel projectors is summarized in table  [ tab : colorop ] .",
    "this color decomposition , combined with the transformation to impact parameter space , diagonalizes the unitarity relation for elastic scattering amplitudes .",
    ".representations and color operators for qcd elastic scattering .",
    "the indices of the projection operators @xmath38 in the last column represent the dimensionalities of the irreducible color representations in the @xmath36-channel .",

    "both the d0  @xcite and the cdf  @xcite collaborations at the tevatron have analyzed the fraction of dijet events with rapidity gaps , as a function of both the transverse energy , @xmath20 , and the pseudorapidity separation , @xmath40 , of the two jets .",
    "as these phase space variables change , the composition of dijet events varies , from mostly gluon initiated processes at small @xmath20 and @xmath41 ( and , hence , small feynman-@xmath19 , @xmath42 ) to @xmath13 scattering at large values .",
    "a dependence of the gap fraction on the color structure of the scattering partons would thus be reflected in a variation with @xmath20 and @xmath41 .",
    "bjorken s two gluon exchange model , which is equivalent to the small @xmath43 region in our analysis , predicts a larger fraction of color singlet exchange events for gluon initiated processes  @xcite ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fs.vs.psi ] for @xmath44 ) .",
    "the gap fraction should thus decrease with increasing @xmath20 or @xmath41 .",
    "the opposite behavior is expected in statistical models of color rearrangement  @xcite . here",
    "the eight color degrees of freedom for gluons , as compared to three for quarks , make it less likely for gluon initiated processes that @xmath0-channel color singlet exchange is achieved by random color rearrangement .",
    "this would lead to a smaller gap fraction at small @xmath42 and therefore small @xmath20 or @xmath41 .    in the unitarized rpwe framework ,",
    "the dependence on the regularization parameters is sufficiently strong to encompass both scenarios .",
    "this is demonstrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : fgap.exp.d0 ] and [ fig : fgap.exp.cdf ] , where the results of the running coupling analysis for three choices of the regularization parameters are compared with tevatron data , taken at @xmath45  gev .",
    "the data correspond to dijet events with two opposite hemisphere jets of @xmath46  gev , @xmath47 ( cdf ) or @xmath48  gev , @xmath49 ( d0 ) .",
    "d0 data are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite and show the fraction of dijet events with rapidity gaps .",
    "cdf  @xcite shows the ratio of gap fractions in individual @xmath41 and @xmath20 bins to the overall gap fraction in the acceptance region . for comparing our calculation with the data we fix the survival probability @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ps ] ) to reproduce the overall gap fraction in the acceptance region , which was measured as @xmath50 for the d0 sample and @xmath51 for the cdf sample .",
    "required survival probabilities strongly depend on regularization parameters and vary between 1.9% and 5.5% , which is on the low side of previous estimates  @xcite . for a given choice of regularization parameters , predictions for the @xmath20 or @xmath41 dependence of the gap fraction",
    "are quite similar for the cdf and d0 cuts . to the extent that the two data sets are consistent within errors , it is not yet possible to discriminate between different choices of regularization parameters , i.e. to obtain sensitivity to the non - perturbative dynamics .",
    "d0 data somewhat favor color singlet fractions which grow with @xmath42 and which are more in line with expectations from color evaporation models  @xcite . note that our unitarized gluon exchange model , with @xmath52  gev and @xmath53  gev is able to describe this trend , even though it is an extension of the two - gluon exchange model .",
    "cdf data slightly prefer a gap fraction which decreases with increasing @xmath41 and , hence , with larger @xmath42 . the unitarized gluon exchange model , with @xmath54  gev and @xmath55  gev describes such a situation .",
    "comparison with fig .",
    "[ fig : fs.reg.dep ] shows that this set of parameters predicts a much smaller gap fraction for @xmath13 scattering than for gluon initiated processes , which is qualitatively similar to the two - gluon exchange model  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the shape of the gap fraction for the two gluon exchange model is very similar to the long - dashed curves in fig .  [",
    "fig : fgap.exp.cdf ] .",
    "clearly , the data are not yet precise enough to unambiguously distinguish between these different scenarios . on the theoretical side ,",
    "the variation of the rpwe predictions with model parameters highlights the limitations of a perturbative approach to the color singlet exchange probability . taking the phase @xmath23 and the survival probability @xmath22 as free parameters ,",
    "the unitarized two - gluon exchange model is clearly capable of fitting the present tevatron data , however .",
    "the formation of rapidity gaps in hadronic scattering events is a common occurrence , and its ubiquity asks for a theoretical explanation within qcd .",
    "the formation of gaps between two hard jets at the tevatron is particularly intriguing and is commonly being explained in terms of color singlet exchange in the @xmath0-channel , be it via an effective color singlet object like the `` pomeron '' or via a statistical color rearrangement , in terms of multiple soft gluon exchange .",
    "`` pomeron '' exchange models build on the observation that color singlet exchange in the @xmath0-channel can be achieved in qcd via the exchange of two gluons , with compensating colors  @xcite .",
    "when trying to build a quantitative model for the formation of rapidity gaps  @xcite , one encounters infrared divergences in the color singlet hard scattering amplitude , which in a full treatment would be regularized by the finite size and the color singlet nature of physical hadrons  @xcite . in turn , this indicates that non - perturbative information may be indispensable for a quantitative understanding of the hard color singlet exchange process .",
    "we have analyzed this question within a particular model , based on the unitarization of single gluon exchange in the @xmath0-channel .",
    "the low - nussinov model  @xcite corresponds to a truncation of the unitarization at order @xmath56 .",
    "we find that , for any reasonable range of regularization parameters , the two - gluon exchange approximation violates partial wave unitarity , and thus a fully unitarized amplitude is needed for phenomenological applications .",
    "the unitarization of hard elastic quark and gluon scattering is not unique , of course , but any acceptable method must preserve the successful description of hard dijet events by perturbative qcd .",
    "the phase shift approach used here fulfills this requirement : the unitarization does not change the born - level predictions for the color averaged differential cross sections . as a corollary ,",
    "the color - inclusive dijet cross section is independent of the regularization parameters which need to be introduced for the full phase shift analysis .",
    "the situation is entirely different when considering the @xmath0-channel color singlet exchange component which is introduced by the exchange of two or more gluons or by unitarization .",
    "the @xmath0-channel color singlet exchange fraction , @xmath14 , is strongly affected by the full unitarization and deviates from the expectations of the two - gluon exchange approximation , changing even the qualitative predictions of the low - nussinov model .",
    "these strong unitarization effects are reflected by a strong dependence on the precise regularization procedure .",
    "this cutoff dependence , which parameterizes non - perturbative effects , does not allow to make quantitative predictions for the color singlet exchange fractions in particular partonic subprocesses .",
    "these limitations , which have been demonstrated here for the two - gluon exchange approximation to the pomeron , may be generic to pomeron exchange models , and should be analyzed more generally .    in spite of these limitations , we find some intriguing features of the unitarized gluon exchange amplitudes .",
    "for all partonic subprocesses and for all regularization parameters , the color singlet exchange fractions can be described in terms of a single universal phase , @xmath57 , which absorbs all non - perturbative effects .",
    "this suggests a unified phenomenological description of the rapidity gap data , via the gap survival probability @xmath22 and the phase @xmath57 .",
    "such an analysis goes beyond the transverse momentum and pseudorapidity dependence of rapidity gap fractions which have just become available , and should best be performed directly by the experimental collaborations .",
