    "the factorization formalism of nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite provides a rigorous theoretical framework for the description of heavy - quarkonium production and decay .",
    "this implies a separation of process - dependent short - distance coefficients , to be calculated perturbatively as expansions in the strong - coupling constant @xmath5 , from supposedly universal long - distance matrix elements ( ldmes ) , to be extracted from experiment .",
    "the relative importance of the latter can be estimated by means of velocity scaling rules ; _ i.e. _ , the ldmes are predicted to scale with a definite power of the heavy - quark ( @xmath6 ) velocity @xmath7 in the limit @xmath8 . in this way ,",
    "the theoretical predictions are organized as double expansions in @xmath5 and @xmath7 .",
    "a crucial feature of this formalism is that it takes into account the complete structure of the @xmath9 fock space , which is spanned by the states @xmath10}$ ] with definite spin @xmath11 , orbital angular momentum @xmath12 , total angular momentum @xmath13 , and color multiplicity @xmath14 . in particular",
    ", this formalism predicts the existence of color - octet ( co ) processes in nature .",
    "this means that @xmath9 pairs are produced at short distances in co states and subsequently evolve into physical , color - singlet ( cs ) quarkonia by the nonperturbative emission of soft gluons . in the limit @xmath15 , the traditional cs model ( csm ) is recovered in the case of @xmath11-wave quarkonia . in the case of @xmath0 production ,",
    "the csm prediction is based just on the @xmath16}$ ] cs state , while the leading relativistic corrections , of relative order @xmath17 , are built up by the @xmath18}$ ] , @xmath19}$ ] , and @xmath20}$ ] ( @xmath21 ) co states .",
    "the greatest success of nrqcd was that it was able to explain the @xmath0 hadroproduction yield at the fermilab tevatron @xcite , while the csm prediction lies orders of magnitudes below the data , even if the latter is evaluated at nlo @xcite .",
    "the situation is similar for the transverse momentum ( @xmath4 ) distribution at bnl rhic @xcite .",
    "also in the case of @xmath0 photoproduction at desy hera , the csm cross section at nlo significantly falls short of the data @xcite .",
    "complete nlo calculations for the co contributions were performed for inclusive @xmath0 production in two - photon collisions @xcite , @xmath22 annihilation @xcite , and direct photoproduction @xcite . as for hadroproduction at nlo , before this talk was given , the co contributions due to intermediate @xmath18}$ ] and @xmath19}$ ] states @xcite were calculated as well as the complete nlo corrections to @xmath23 production , including both @xmath24}$ ] and @xmath19}$ ] contributions @xcite .    in order to convincingly establish the co mechanism and the ldme universality , it had been an urgent task to complete the nlo @xmath0 hadroproduction calculation by including the full co contributions .",
    "this was actually achieved in the work @xcite presented at this conference .",
    "our strategy for testing nrqcd factorization in @xmath0 production at nlo is as follows .",
    "we first perform a common fit of the co ldmes to the @xmath4 distributions measured by cdf in hadroproduction at tevatron run  ii @xcite and by h1 in photoproduction at hera1 @xcite and hera2 @xcite ( see table  [ tab : fit ] and fig .  [",
    "fig : fitgraphs ] ) .",
    "we then compare the @xmath4 distributions measured by phenix at rhic @xcite and cms at the lhc @xcite as well as the @xmath25 and @xmath26 distributions measured by h1 at hera1 @xcite and hera2 @xcite with our respective nlo predictions based on these co ldmes ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : other ] ) . for details on the calculation and",
    "the input parameters used , we refer the reader to ref .  @xcite .",
    ".[tab : fit ] nlo fit results for the @xmath0 co ldmes . [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the @xmath4 distribution of @xmath0 hadroproduction measured experimentally flattens at @xmath27  gev due to nonperturbative effects , a feature that can not be faithfully described by fixed - order perturbation theory .",
    "we , therefore , exclude the cdf data points with @xmath27  gev from our fit .",
    "we have checked that our fit results depend only feebly on the precise location of this cutoff .",
    "the fit results for the co ldmes corresponding to our default nlo nrqcd predictions are collected in table  [ tab : fit ] . in figs .",
    "[ fig : fitgraphs](a ) and ( b ) , the latter ( solid lines ) are compared with the cdf @xcite and h1 @xcite data , respectively .    for comparison , also the default predictions at lo ( dashed lines ) as well as those of the csm at nlo ( dot - dashed lines ) and lo ( dotted lines ) are shown . in order to visualize the size of the nlo corrections to the hard - scattering cross sections , the lo predictions are evaluated with the same ldmes .",
    "we observe from fig .",
    "[ fig : fitgraphs](c ) that the @xmath20}$ ] short - distance cross section of hadroproduction receives sizable nlo corrections that even turn it negative at @xmath28  gev .",
    "this is , however , not problematic because a particular co contribution represents an unphysical quantity depending on the nrqcd scale @xmath29 and the choices of the renormalization scheme and is entitled to become negative as long as the full cross section remains positive .",
    "in contrast to the situation at lo , the line shapes of the @xmath18}$ ] and @xmath20}$ ] contributions significantly differ at nlo .",
    "therefore we can now , in our combined hera - tevatron fit , independently determine @xmath1 } ) \\rangle$ ] and @xmath3 } ) \\rangle$ ] .",
    "notice that @xmath3 } ) \\rangle$ ] comes out negative , which is not problematic for the same reasons as explained above for the short distance cross sections .",

    "[ fig : other ] that our nlo nrqcd predictions nicely describe the @xmath4 distributions from phenix @xcite ( a ) and cms @xcite ( b ) as well as the @xmath25 distributions from h1 @xcite ( c ) , with most of the data points falling inside the yellow ( light shaded ) error band .",
    "the nlo nrqcd prediction of the @xmath26 distribution ( d ) agrees with the h1 data in the intermediate @xmath26 range , but its slope appears to be somewhat too steep at first sight .",
    "however , the contribution due to resolved photoproduction , which is not yet included here , is expected to fill the gap in the low-@xmath26 range , precisely where the resolved contribution is peaked .",
    "near the high-@xmath26 endpoint region , the nrqcd expansion is understood to break down , and the nrqcd series could be resummed via the introduction of universal shape functions @xcite , possibly in the context of soft collinear effective theory @xcite .",
    "we have performed a complete nlo calculation of the inclusive @xmath0 direct photo- and hadroproduction cross sections including the full cs and co contributions .",
    "we conclude from figs .",
    "[ fig : fitgraphs](a ) and ( b ) and [ fig : other](a)(d ) that all experimental data sets considered here significantly overshoot the nlo csm predictions , by many experimental standard deviations . specifically ,",
    "the excess amounts to 12 orders of magnitude in the case of hadroproduction and typically a factor of 3 in the case of photoproduction . on the other hand , these data nicely agree with the nlo nrqcd predictions , apart from well - understood deviations in the case of the @xmath26 distribution of photoproduction .    in our work for the first time",
    "a multi - process fit of the co ldmes is performed , which come out to be consistent with nrqcd scaling rules .",
    "our work therefore constitutes the most rigorous evidence for the existence of co processes in nature and the ldme universality since the introduction of the nrqcd factorization formalism 15 years ago @xcite .",
    "we should remark that our theoretical predictions refer to direct @xmath0 production , while the cdf and cms data include all prompt events and the h1 and phenix data even non - prompt ones .",
    "however , the resulting error turns out to be small against our theoretical uncertainties and has no effect on our conclusions .",
    "we would like to thank geoffrey bodwin and gustav kramer for useful discussions and barbara jacak and cesar luiz da silva for help with comparing our predictions to the phenix data @xcite .",
    "as a last point , we compare our results with those obtained by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , another full nlo nrqcd calculation of @xmath0 hadroproduction , which appeared after this talk was held . adopting their inputs ,",
    "we find agreement with their results for the @xmath16}$ ] , @xmath18}$ ] , @xmath19}$ ] , and @xmath20}$ ] contributions .",
    "however , their fitting philosophy greatly differs from ours .",
    "specifically , they only fit to tevatron data with @xmath30  gev , but account for prompt production , while we jointly fit to tevatron data with @xmath31  gev and hera data neglecting feed - down contributions .",
    "detailed investigation reveals that the feed - down correction and the shift in the lower @xmath4 cut on the tevatron data only moderately affect our joint fit .",
    "however , excluding the hera data altogether renders the fit greatly underdetermined .",
