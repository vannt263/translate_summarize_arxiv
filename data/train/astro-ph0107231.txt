    "the steepening of the all - particle spectrum around @xmath1 ( the `` knee '' ) discovered in 1958 @xcite has been the subject of numerous speculations on the propagation and acceleration mechanisms of galactic cosmic rays ( see , for example , the reviews by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the usually accepted picture of cosmic ray propagation in the interstellar medium is a normal diffusion , which can be described by equation for concentration @xcite @xmath2 the `` knee '' is not an intrinsic property of this model under the natural physical conditions @xmath3 , @xmath4 . because of these reasons discussions have mainly been directed to a search and a justification of breakdown mechanisms either of the diffusivity @xmath5 or of the source density @xmath6 .",
    "however , in spite of considerable theoretical and experimental efforts , a model , which can explain    1 .",
    "different values of spectral exponent of protons and other nuclei , 2 .",
    "mass composition variations at @xmath7 + gev / nucleon , 3 .   the steepening of the all - particle spectrum    was not developed .",
    "recently , in our papers @xcite new view of the `` knee '' problem was presented .",
    "it has been shown that the `` knee '' in the primary cosmic rays spectrum is due to fractal structure of the interstellar medium , that is another regime of particles diffusion in the galaxy .    in this paper",
    "we consider the propagation of galactic cosmic rays in the fractal interstellar medium taking into account that a particle can spend long time in a trap .",
    "we demonstrate the main results of this new model in a wide energy region @xmath8 gev / nucleon .",
    "based on the results @xcite the cosmic ray propagation in the fractal interstellar medium is described by fractional diffusion equation . without energy losses and nuclear interactions , the equation for concentration of the cosmic rays with energy @xmath9 generated by sources",
    "@xmath10 has the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the anomalous diffusivity , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are determined by the fractal structure of the medium and by the trapping mechanism , correspondingly ( see @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath15 denotes the riemann - liouville fractional derivative , @xmath16  the fractional laplacian @xcite .    in the case of point impulse source with inverse power spectrum , relating to supernova bursts",
    "@xmath17 the solution of equation ( [ fracdifeq ] ) , found in @xcite is of the form @xmath18}^{t}\\tau^{-3\\beta/\\alpha}\\\\ \\times\\psi_3^{(\\alpha,\\beta)}\\bigl({|\\vec{r}|(d(e,\\alpha,\\beta)\\tau^\\beta)^{-1/\\alpha}}\\bigr)d\\tau,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where the scaling function @xmath19 , @xmath20 is determined by three - dimensional spherically - symmetrical stable distribution @xmath21 and one - sided stable distribution @xmath22 with characteristic exponent @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the anomalous diffusivity @xmath12 is determined by the constants @xmath23 and @xmath24 in the asymptotic behaviour for `` lvy flights '' @xmath25 and `` lvy waiting time '' @xmath26 distributions : @xmath27 taking into account that both the free path and the probability to stay in trap during the time interval @xmath28 for particle with charge @xmath29 and mass number @xmath23 depend on particle magnetic rigidity @xmath30 , we accept @xmath31 .    using the representation @xmath32 and the property @xmath33 of the scaling function @xcite , one can easy find the spectral exponent @xmath34 for observed particles : @xmath35 where @xmath36}^{t}\\tau^{-5\\beta/\\alpha } \\psi_5^{(\\alpha,\\beta)}\\bigl({|\\vec{r}|(d(e,\\alpha,\\beta)\\tau^\\beta)^{-1/\\alpha}}\\bigr)}{\\int\\limits_{\\max[0,t - t]}^{t}\\tau^{-3\\beta/\\alpha } \\psi_3^{(\\alpha,\\beta)}\\bigl({|\\vec{r}|(d(e,\\alpha,\\beta)\\tau^\\beta)^{-1/\\alpha}}\\bigr)}.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] let @xmath37 be a solution of the equation @xmath38 .",
    "one can see from ( [ eta])-([xi ] ) that at @xmath39 the spectral exponent for observed particles @xmath34 is equal to spectral exponent for particles generated by the source : @xmath40 .",
    "since the exponent @xmath41 is less than p at @xmath42 , but the exponent @xmath43 at @xmath44 , @xmath37 can be called the `` knee '' energy .    from experimental values of @xmath45 and @xmath46 one can derive the main parameters of the model ( @xmath47 ) versus the spectral exponent ( @xmath14 ) of `` the lvy waiting time '' : @xmath48    to evaluate the parameter @xmath14 we have used the results presented in the paper @xcite , where an anomalous diffusion of solar magnetic elements have been investigated .",
    "the authors have shown that the trapping time distribution asymtotically takes the form of a lvy distribution with spectral exponent @xmath49 .    assuming that a trapping mechanism is characterized by a kind of self - similarity",
    ", one can expect the some value for @xmath14 in the scales under the consideration . by this reason the value @xmath50 is used in our calculations .",
    "thus , taking @xmath51 and @xmath52 we finally obtain @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "to evaluate the next important parameter  anomalous diffusivity @xmath55 , we have used the experimental data on the particle anisotropy in the the energy region @xmath56 gev / particle in the framework of the scheme proposed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for example , we find @xmath57 in the case @xmath58 for near sources monogem ( @xmath59 ) , geminga ( @xmath60 ) , loop i - iv ( @xmath61 ) .    in the model under consideration",
    "only one parameter @xmath62 connected with the fractal structure of the interstellar medium is found by fit .",
    "extensive calculations of cosmic - ray spectra show that the best fit of experimental data may be get at @xmath63 .",
    "the differential flux @xmath64 of the particles of type @xmath65 due to all sources of galaxy may be separated into two components @xmath66 the first component ( l ) in ( [ j_i ] ) describes the contribution of the nearby sources ( at distance @xmath67 ) to observed flux @xmath64 . the second component ( g )",
    "is the contribution of the distant sources ( @xmath68 ) to @xmath64 .",
    "the similar separation is frequently used in the studies of cosmic rays ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "the list of nearby sources including 16 supernova remnants @xcite is used to calculate the l - component .",
    "the distant sources are supposed to be distributed uniformly both in space and time . in this case",
    "@xmath69 ( see @xcite ) .    based on this result and ( [ n(r , t , e ] ) , we present the differential flux in the form : @xmath70    it is clear from physical point of view that the bulk of observed cosmic rays with energy @xmath71 forms by numerous distant sources .",
    "it means that the observed flux at least of protons and he in this energy region must be described by second term in ( [ j result ] ) . the first term in ( [ j result ] ) defines the spectrum in the high energy region and , as has been shown above , provides the `` knee '' .",
    "we use the spherically symmetric force model of @xcite to describe the solar modulation .",
    "the influence of solar modulation on the particle flux is @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the kinetic energy per nucleon , @xmath74 is the mass of a proton and @xmath75 is the interstellar flux ( [ j result ] ) .",
    "the potential energy @xmath76 , describing the average energy loss of particle from interstellar space to 1 au , is determined by solar modulation parameter @xmath77 .",
    "@xmath78 is accepted in this paper ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the results of our calculation are presented in fig .",

    "we have considered the propagation of galactic cosmic rays in the fractal interstellar medium .",
    "the energy spectra of nuclei ( h , he , cno , ne - si , fe ) and mass composition have been calculated in energy region ( @xmath0 ) gev / particle under the natural physical conditions @xmath79 .",
    "we have shown that the model can explain the different values of spectral exponent of protons and other nuclei , mass composition variations at @xmath7 gev / nucleon , the steepening of the all - particle spectrum .",
