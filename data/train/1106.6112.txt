    "fluctuations and correlations are well known signatures of phase transitions . in particular , the quark / gluon to hadronic phase transition may lead to significant fluctuations @xcite . in 2010 , the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) began a program to search for the qcd critical point .",
    "this involves an `` energy scan '' of au+au collisions from top collision energy ( @xmath2 = 200 gev ) down to energies as low as @xmath2 = 7.7 gev @xcite .",
    "this critical point search will make use of the study of correlations and fluctuations , particularly those that could be enhanced during a phase transition that passes close to the critical point @xcite .",
    "particle ratio fluctuations are an observable that has already been studied as a function of energy and system - size .",
    "combining these previous measurements with new results from the energy scan will provide additional information to assist in locating the qcd critical point .",
    "dynamical particle ratio fluctuations , specifically fluctuations in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 ratio , can provide information on the quark - gluon to hadron phase transition @xcite .",
    "the variable used to measure these fluctuations is referred to as @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath3 was originally introduced to study net charge fluctuations @xcite .",
    "@xmath3 quantifies deviations in the particle ratios from those expected for an ideal statistical poissonian distribution .",
    "the definition of @xmath4 ( describing fluctuations in the @xmath0 ratio ) is , @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the number of kaons and pions in a particular event , respectively . in this proceeding ,",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 are the total charged multiplicity for each particle species",
    ". a formula similar to ( [ nudyn ] ) can be constructed for @xmath1 and other particle ratio fluctuations . by definition ,",
    "@xmath3 = 0 for the case of a poisson distribution of kaons and pions .",
    "it is also largely independent of detector acceptance and efficiency in the region of phase space being considered @xcite .",
    "an in - depth study of @xmath0 fluctuations in au+au collisions at @xmath2 = 200 and 62.4 gev was previously carried out by the star experiment @xcite .",
    "earlier measurements of particle ratio fluctuations utilized the variable @xmath8 @xcite , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the relative width of the @xmath0 or @xmath1 distribution in either real data or mixed events .",
    "it has been shown that @xmath3 is a first order expansion of @xmath8 about the mean of its denominator @xcite .",
    "the two variables are related as @xmath11 .",
    "the data presented here for @xmath0 and @xmath1 fluctuations was acquired by the star experiment at rhic from minimum bias ( mb ) au+au collisions at center - of - mass collision energies ( @xmath2 ) of 200 , 130 , 62.4 , 39 , 19.6 , 11.5 , and 7.7 gev @xcite .",
    "the main particle tracking detector at star is the time projection chamber ( tpc ) @xcite .",
    "all detected charged particles in the pseudorapidity interval @xmath12 were measured .",
    "the transverse momentum ( @xmath13 ) range for pions and kaons was @xmath14 gev/@xmath15 , and for protons was @xmath16 gev/@xmath15 . charged particle identification involved measured ionization energy loss ( @xmath17 ) in the tpc gas and total momentum ( @xmath18 ) of the track .",
    "the energy loss of the identified particle was required to be less than two standard deviations ( 2@xmath10 ) from the predicted energy loss of that particle at a particular momentum .",
    "a second requirement was that the measured energy loss of a pion / kaon was more than 2@xmath10 from the energy loss prediction of a kaon / pion , and similarly for @xmath1 measurements .",
    "the centralities used in this analysis account for 0 - 10 , 10 - 20 , 20 - 30 , 30 - 40 , 40 - 50 , 50 - 60 , 60 - 70 , and 70 - 80% of the total hadronic cross section .",
    "data was also analyzed using the recently completed time of flight ( tof ) detector @xcite .",
    "the tof is a multi - gap resistive plate chamber ( mrpc ) detector .",
    "particle identification was carried out using the time - of - flight information for a track along with its momentum , determined by the tpc . from these two quantities",
    "the particle s mass can be calculated .",

    "dynamical @xmath1 fluctuations are always negative due to correlated production of protons and pions from resonances such as the @xmath26 . similar to @xmath4 at @xmath2 = 39 gev , dynamical @xmath1 fluctuations are approximately centrality independent until @xmath27 50 , where they become less negative in the peripheral bins .",

    "the multiplicity scaled @xmath25 at @xmath2 = 11.5 gev does not show a rapid change as a function of centrality in peripheral collisions , as the same observable does at @xmath2 = 39 gev in figure [ ppi_39gev ] .",
    "in central collisions , the multiplicity scaled @xmath25 at @xmath2 = 11.5 gev measures @xmath29 -0.8 , whereas in central collisions at @xmath2 = 39 gev it reaches a value of @xmath29 -0.6 .",

    "the antibaryon / baryon ratio is @xmath30 0.01 @xcite .",
    "thus , the measurement of @xmath1 fluctuations at this energy is dominated by protons .",
    "measurements using both tpc and tof particle identification are strongly negative and approximately independent of centrality .",

    "the na49 experiment observes a strong decrease with increasing incident energy for central 0 - 3.5% pb+pb collisions ( solid blue squares ) .",
    "particle production mechanisms change with energy , so an energy independent fluctuation requires further study to determine systematically which components of @xmath3 are changing .",
    "urqmd does not demonstrate a strong energy dependence , while another transport model ( hsd , not shown ) replicates the large increase in fluctuations at low energy observed by na49 .",

    "star measures a general trend from larger , negative values of @xmath1 fluctuations at lower energies , which then increases towards zero at @xmath2 = 39 gev .",

    "the model prediction reproduce the qualitative trend shown in the data , but over predicts the magnitude at higher energies and crosses from negative to positive values .",
