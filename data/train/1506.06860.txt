    "understanding novel features of the fundamental nuclear forces and properties of strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions of density , temperature , spin , and isospin are among the main goals of nuclear physics .",
    "heavy - ion collision ( hic ) experiments play an important role in achieving these goals .",
    "indeed , great achievements have been made using hics at various beam energies from the sub - colomb barrier to the highest energy available at the large hadron collider .",
    "in particular , terrestrial experiments using intermediate - energy hics have led to strong constraints on the equations of state of hadronic matter  @xcite and neutron - rich nucleonic matter  @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies have shown recently that some spin - sensitive observables of hics can be used to explore the in - medium properties of non - central nuclear forces .",
    "the spin - dependent nuclear interactions are important for explaining several interesting features of nuclear structure  @xcite , such as the varying magic numbers and the shell evolution with the isospin asymmetry of finite nuclei .",
    "however , the strength , density , and isospin dependence of the nuclear spin - orbit coupling are still uncertain ( see sec .  [ so ] ) .",
    "moreover , the tensor force can modify the magic number of nuclei and is an important source of the nucleon - nucleon short - range correlation .",
    "the latter is related to many interesting phenomena in nuclear physics ( see sec .",
    "[ ntensor ] ) .",
    "more studies on in - medium properties of the spin - orbit coupling and tensor force are thus vey much needed .",
    "hics provide flexible ways of adjusting the conditions of the nuclear medium and may also lead to new spin - dependent phenomena .",
    "for example , the so - called  spin hall effect \"  @xcite , which affects the dynamics of spin - up and spin - down particles differently as a result of the spin - orbit coupling , is expected to be a general feature in any spin transport process .",
    "it thus might be interesting to test if such phenomenon can also happen in hics .",
    "considerable efforts using the time - dependent hartree - fock ( tdhf ) model , the spin- and isospin - dependent boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( sibuu ) transport model , and the quantum molecular dynamics ( qmd ) model have been devoted to exploring the spin dynamics in hics ( see sec .  [ reactions ] ) . indeed , some interesting phenomena were found .",
    "for example , it was found that the inclusion of the spin - dependent nuclear interaction may affect the fusion threshold , generate the spin twist during the collision process , and lead to the spin splitting of nucleon collective flows ( see sec .",

    "a major goal of this article is to stimulate more experimental work in this direction .",
    "based on the one - boson - exchange picture  @xcite , nuclear force can be understood by exchanging mesons between nucleons . exchanging the scalar @xmath0 meson and vector @xmath1 meson leads to respectively the attractive and repulsive central nuclear force as well as the spin - orbit interaction , while exchanging the @xmath2 meson and @xmath3 meson leads to respectively the long - range and short - range nuclear tensor force .",
    "although in free space the bare nuclear force is well constrained by the nucleon - nucleon scattering data , the in - medium nuclear interactions , especially the nuclear spin - orbit interaction and tensor force , are still quite uncertain .",
    "the in - medium nuclear interactions can be studied by using microscopic many - body theories or phenomenological models , such as the non - relativistic skyrme - hartree - fock ( shf ) model and the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) model . in the following",

    "the nuclear spin - orbit interaction was first introduced to explain the magic numbers of nuclei  @xcite .",
    "nuclei with numbers of neutrons or protons equal to the magic numbers are more stable , and this reflects the special shell structure of a nucleus .",
    "although even a simple harmonic potential leads to the shell structure of nucleon energy levels inside nuclei , the spin - orbit coupling is essential to reproduce the correct magic number .    in the skyrme interaction , the effective spin - orbit force between two nucleons at position @xmath4 and @xmath5",

    "nevertheless , the density dependence of the spin - orbit coupling is still largely unknown so far , and it is related to many interesting phenomena in nuclear structure studies  @xcite .",
    "second , the spin - orbit couplings from the shf and rmf approach have different isospin dependence , i.e. , in the shf approach the spin - orbit coupling is stronger for nucleons of the same isospin , while in the rmf approach the coupling strength is the same for neutrons and protons .",
    "this feature impacts descriptions of properties of neutron - rich nuclei , e.g. , the kink in the evolution of the charge radii for lead isotopes .",
    "it was shown that the weak isospin dependence of the spin - orbit coupling in the rmf approach can better explain the kink than the conventional shf functional . however ,",
    "if the form factor in the latter approach was modified to  @xcite @xmath32 a similar kink can be reproduced with @xmath33  @xcite , corresponding to the case with very small fock contribution of the spin - orbit interaction .",

    "@xcite for a review .",
    "making use of the analyzing power of a nucleus might be the most promising way of identifying the spin of free nucleons or light clusters experimentally .",

    "in summary , we outlined the major physics motivations of investigating the in - medium spin - dependent nuclear interactions , i.e. , the spin - orbit interaction and the nuclear tensor force , and summarized some recent efforts in exploring the spin dynamics in low- and intermediate - energy heavy - ion collisions . in particular , the studies on the strength , the density , and the isospin dependence of the spin - orbit interaction as well as the short - range correlation induced by the tensor force are highlighted . in tdhf studies",
