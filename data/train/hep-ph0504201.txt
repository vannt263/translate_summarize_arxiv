    "other results will be presented elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "combined ope errors for the various pfesr s are obtained by adding in quadrature uncertainties associated with the ope input parameters ( @xmath102 condensates , @xmath145 , and @xmath5 ) and the truncation / residual scale dependence of the integrated @xmath112 series .",
    "the latter are estimated to be _",
    "twice _ the magnitude of the last term in the corresponding truncated series . the resulting ope error estimate is somewhat more conservative than that employed by hmnt .",

    "the dashed lines represent the central ope results , the solid lines the upper and lower edges of the ope error bands . because of the strong correlations , the ope band is better thought of as a bundle of allowed parallel lines than as a generally allowed region .",
    "we see that , in the region @xmath146 , both the magnitude and slope of the integrals over the @xmath1 decay distribution are in good agreement with ope expectations . in contrast , the em spectral integrals are consistently low relative to ope expectations ( particularly for @xmath30 greater than @xmath147 ) and have slopes with respect to @xmath30 significantly lower than those of the ope curves .",
    "both features of the em results are as expected if the @xmath1 data is correct , and hence the em data low , in the disputed region .    the implications of the normalizations of the em and @xmath1 spectral integrals can be quantified by working out the @xmath5 required to match the ope and spectral sides of a given pfesr .",
    "the reliability of the ope , and hence of the extraction of @xmath5 , is optimized by choosing @xmath30 as large as possible  in the case of hadronic @xmath1 decay , @xmath148 .",
    "results corresponding to central input for the small @xmath149 ope contributions and the @xmath148 values of the spectral integrals are shown in table  [ table1 ] for both the em and @xmath1 cases .",
    "the agreement between the @xmath1-decay and independent high - scale determinations is excellent  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the em data corresponds to @xmath5 @xmath27 lower than the high - scale determination .",

    "there is , however , no evidence for such a contribution , at a level which would impact our analysis , in the @xmath30 dependence of either the em or @xmath1 @xmath144-weighted spectral integrals  @xcite .",

    "we have shown that weighted spectral integrals constructed using @xmath4 hadronic @xmath1 decay data are in good agreement with ope expectations , while those involving em data ( i ) require a value of @xmath5 @xmath27 below that given by high - scale determinations and ( ii ) correspond to a slope with respect to @xmath30 in @xmath156 disagreement with the ope prediction .",
    "the slope problem , moreover , _ can not _ be cured simply by adopting the lower @xmath5 values , shown in table  [ table1 ] , which would bring the normalization of the ope and spectral integrals into agreement for @xmath157 .",
    "the insensitivity of the slope to @xmath5 also means that the agreement between the ope expectation and the observed slope for the @xmath1 decay spectral integrals represents a non - trivial test of the @xmath1 data .",
    "one possibility is that the problems with the em sum rules might be attributable to the presence of residual duality violation at the intermediate scales studied here ; the success of the ope in predicting both the slope and magnitude of the @xmath1-decay - based spectral integrals over the whole of the region @xmath158 , however , renders such an explanation highly implausible .",
    "the results thus point to the reliability of the @xmath1 data , and to the likelihood of either ( i ) a problem with the experimental em spectral distribution , or ( ii ) the presence of as - yet - unidentified non - one - photon physics contributions in the experimental em cross - sections .",
    "this in turn suggests that @xmath9 determinations which incorporate @xmath1 decay data are to be favored over those employing em spectral data only .",
    "while the disagreement between the em and high - scale determinations of @xmath5 is only @xmath159 , even with significantly lower high - scale input , e.g. , the 2002 pdg average @xmath160 used by hmnt , the em normalization , and even more so the em slope , would still require , on average , upward fluctuations in @xmath32 .",
    "since @xmath161 , such fluctuations would typically also increase @xmath8_{had}^{lo}$ ] .",
    "thus , even ignoring the slope problem and assessing the em data as moderately consistent , within errors , with the ope constraints , the fact that the spectral integrals lie consistently below the corresponding ope constraint values , for any sensible input @xmath5 , points to the likelihood of a @xmath8_{had}^{lo}$ ] value higher than the current central em - data - based value .",
    "two further points are of relevance to assessing the implications of our results for the value of @xmath8_{had}^{lo}$ ] .",
    "first , we find that , replacing the em @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath129 data with the equivalent @xmath1 data resolves completely both the normalization and slope problems for the resulting modified `` em '' spectral integrals  @xcite .",
    "second , it is readily demonstrated that the pfesr s employed are sensitive to , not just the discrepancies in the @xmath22 region , but also those in the @xmath162 region .",
    "( this is relevant since the @xmath8_{had}^{lo}$ ] integral is dominated by the @xmath162 spectral contribution . ) in fact , for the @xmath143 pfesr , the shift in the em spectral integral associated with the modification of the @xmath162 part of the em spectral function represents @xmath163 of the full shift at @xmath164 and @xmath165 at @xmath148 .",
    "the corresponding figures for the @xmath144 pfesr are @xmath166 at @xmath164 and @xmath167 at @xmath148 .",
    "thus , even though the pfesr s employed are relatively more sensitive to the @xmath22 spectral contributions than is the @xmath8_{had}^{lo}$ ] integral , a clear sensitivity to the @xmath162 component remains , making the constraints associated with these pfesr s highly relevant to the @xmath8_{had}^{lo}$ ] problem .    in conclusion , all the sum rule tests performed favor the reliability of the @xmath1 decay data , and point to problems with the em data .",
    "we conclude that , at present , determinations of @xmath8_{had}^{lo}$ ] employing ib - corrected @xmath1 decay data are more reliable than those based on em data alone , and hence that there is no clear sign of a discrepancy between the current experimental value for @xmath9 and the sm prediction . .15in_note",
