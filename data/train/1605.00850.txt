    "the classification of matter by using various topological properties of the band structure has become a central subject in condensed matter physics .",
    "the berry curvature@xcite embedded within the band structure plays an important role in constructing various topological indices .",
    "thus , it was found that the quantized hall conductance in the integer quantum hall regime can be determined by the topological index chern number ( ch ) or tknn integer  @xcite , which was shown to be the integral of the berry curvature over the brillouin zone of the bulk system .",
    "a change in the chern number corresponds to a change in the number of edge currents , which is the bulk - edge correspondence  @xcite .",
    "importantly , in ref .",
    "@xcite , haldane proposed a time - reversal - symmetry - broken two - band model that exhibits an energy gap without landau levels in the bulk and gapless excitation at the edge of a honeycomb lattice , the so - called chern insulator .",
    "the variation in the chern number is due to a band - touching phenomenon , in which the energy gap of the bulk system closes and opens at some dirac points in the brillouin zone . in this sense ,",
    "the band - touching phenomenon , generated by different mechanisms , would lead to different topological phases .",
    "accounting for the spin - orbit interaction , the combination of a chern insulator and its time - reversal pair results in the quantum - spin hall phase in graphene ( kane - mele model ) @xcite and hgte quantum wells ( bhz model ) @xcite in a two - dimensional system .",
    "this time - reversal - invariant quantum spin hall insulator composed of two time - reversal - breaking chern insulators has been generalized to three - dimensional systems , where it is called a topological insulator @xcite .",
    "this was later confirmed experimentally @xcite .",
    "the topological phases of the time - reversal invariant system can be determined by calculating the @xmath6 topological index of the bulk system @xcite or the spin chern number @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a quantum anomalous hall phase can be exhibited in graphene with a rashba spin - orbit interaction in the presence of an exchange field @xcite .",
    "it was theoretically proposed that in a honeycomb lattice with a kane - mele hamiltonian including the rashba spin - orbit interaction , the quantum spin hall phase persists in the presence of an exchange field , i.e. , the time - reversal symmetry is broken @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was demonstrated that the edge state in the quantum spin hall phase can persist even for a strong magnetic field .",
    "moreover , because the spin - orbit interaction relates to the orbital motion of the electron , a change in the chern number from positive to negative integer leads to a change in the direction of the edge current , and the out - of - plane spin polarization ( hereafter called spin polarization for convenience ) may change due to the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "however , this is not always true because the spin polarization of the edge states would also be affected by the on - site potential , as in the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the edge current is exhibited by the haldane current loops at site - i or site - ii atoms .",
    "the zigzag ribbon naturally has site - i atoms at one outer edge and site - ii at the opposite outer edge .",
    "this implies that the two haldane current loops must contribute unequally to the edge currents [ see fig . [ figlattice](a ) ] , and that one of the two haldane current loops would dominate at one edge . at",
    "right ( left ) side of the ribbon , the site - i ( site - ii ) atoms has more nearest neighbor atoms than site - ii ( site - i ) atoms .",
    "because the rashba spin - orbit interaction governs the nearest neighbor hopping of different sites , this implies that the two different sites must contribute unequally to the spin polarization of edge currents .",
    "furthermore , different spin states at the edges of a honeycomb lattice with a zigzag edge would occupy different sites under broken time reversal symmetry .",
    "thus , the on - site potential would behave like an effective magnetic field for the edge states . as a result ,",
    "the bulk spin polarization for site - i and site - ii atoms would have the same behavior as the spin polarization of edge currents . in a manner similar to the bulk - edge correspondence in the chern number , there would be an approximate bulk - edge correspondence for spin polarization .",
    "therefore , if the band - touching phenomenon is caused by the on - site potential , a question arises naturally : can the spin polarization of the edge currents also be protected in the time - reversal - symmetry - broken system with a spin - orbit interaction under a change in the chern number ?",
    "furthermore , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors proposed a scheme to realize the haldane model by using ultracold atoms trapped in an optical lattice .",
    "later , the detection of the topological phase of a chern insulator was proposed in ref .",
    "recently , it was shown experimentally that the haldane model can be exhibited with ultracold fermions @xcite .    motivated by these issues , in this paper",
    ", we study a haldane system with rashba spin - orbit interaction @xcite in a honeycomb lattice , from now on called a haldane - rashba system . the change in the chern number in the haldane system generated by the on - site potential",
    "is known to be @xmath7 and @xmath8 for a negative and positive haldane phase , respectively .",
    "a non - zero chern number is called a chern - insulating phase .",
    "the number of dirac points of the haldane system is 2 in the brillouin zone ( see fig .",
    "[ figdps ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the number of dirac points in the pure rashba system is 6 in the honeycomb lattice @xcite [ see fig .  [ figlattice](b ) ] .",
    "we will show that in the haldane - rashba system the resulting chern number patterns are @xmath1 and @xmath9 for a negative and positive haldane phase , respectively .",
    "therefore , the haldane - rashba system would be a candidate for the investigation of the persistence of spin polarization of the edge states under a change in the chern number .",
    "we will show that the spin - polarization of the edge currents persists under the change in chern number and furthermore that the magnitude of the spin polarization can be tuned by the on - site potential .",
    "this implies that we could control the orientation of the spin polarization of the edge currents in a single chern - insulating phase .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : hrs ] , we introduce the haldane - rashba system .",

    "the chern number pattern is @xmath9 for positive haldane phase and @xmath42 for negative haldane phase . if the on - site potential is fixed , the change in sign of the haldane phase changes the direction of the edge currents and the sign of the out - of - plane spin polarization .",
    "interestingly , we found that the spin polarization of the edge states persists under the change in the chern number .",
    "furthermore , the spin polarization of the edge states vary with the on - site potential , which implies that the on - site potential effectively couples to the spin of the edge states and behaves like an effective magnetic field .",
    "we calculated the bulk spin polarization and found that the spin polarization of the edge states approximately follows the bulk spin polarization .",
    "this indicates that the zigzag ribbon with two different haldane current loops exhibits an approximate bulk - edge correspondence to the spin polarization .",
    "we found that the orientation of the spin polarization of the edge states could vary in a single chern - insulating phase by tuning the on - site potential , which would play a crucial role in spintronics .",

    "<S> we investigate the change in the non - zero chern number and out - of - plane spin polarization of the edge currents in a honeycomb lattice with the haldane - rashba interaction . </S>",
    "<S> this interaction breaks the time - reversal symmetry due to the haldane phase caused by a current loop at site - i and -ii atoms and also accounts for the rashba - type spin - orbit interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the rashba spin - orbit interaction increases the number of dirac points and the band - touching phenomenon can be generated by tuning the on - site potential in the non - zero haldane phase . by using the pontryagin winding number and numerical berry curvature methods , we find that the chern number pattern is @xmath0 and @xmath1 for the positive and negative haldane phase , respectively . a non - zero chern number is called a chern - insulating phase . </S>",
    "<S> we discovered that changes in both the haldane phase and on - site potential leads to a change in the orientation of the bulk spin polarization of site - i and site - ii atoms . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , in a ribbon with a zigzag edge , which naturally has site - i atoms at one outer edge and site - ii atoms at the opposite outer edge , the spin polarization of the edge states approximately obeys the properties of bulk spin polarization regardless of the change in the chern number . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , even when the chern number changes from @xmath2 to @xmath3 ( or @xmath4 to @xmath5 ) , by tuning the strength of the on - site potential , the sign of the spin polarization of the edge states persists . </S>",
    "<S> this approximate bulk - edge correspondence of the spin polarization in the haldane - rashba system would play an important role in spintronics , because it enables us to control the orientation of the spin polarization in a single chern - insulating phase . </S>"
