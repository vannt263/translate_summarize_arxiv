    "the study of physical systems that admit a geometric description in terms of riemannian manifolds is an interesting and timely subject . over the last few years",
    ", there has been a number of efforts towards an integrated description of thermodynamics in terms of legendre invariant quantities .",
    "in particular , analogously to the case of field theories , it has been argued that the curvature of the appropriate manifold should be linked to the notion of thermodynamic interaction @xcite .",
    "there has been numerous proposals in this direction .",
    "on the one hand , there are the conformally related metric theories of ruppeiner and weinhold , where the metric takes the form of a hessian of the extensive parameters in the entropy and energy representations , respectively @xcite .",
    "however , both fail to comply with the spirit of the geometric construction of field theories , i.e. those are _ not _ invariant under the natural set of transformations in thermodynamics . on the other hand , the geometrothermodynamics programme ( gtd ) has successfully managed to provide us with a set of metrics which are independent of the potential used @xcite and the fundamental representation one uses @xcite .    in the gtd programme one",
    "posits that the physical information about a thermodynamic system can not depend on the potential used to describe it and that such information is encoded in the curvature of the maximal integral manifold of the pfaffian system defining the first law of thermodynamics [ c.f .",
    "equation ] .",
    "we call such a manifold the _ space of equilibrium states_. the curvature of such manifold is obtained from the first fundamental form , induced but a legendre invariant metric of the contact manifold specified by the pfaffian form . in section [ sec.gtd ]",
    "we present a brief review of the programme , in particular , we centre our attention on a metric whose curvature does not depend on the fundamental representation .",
    "thus far , the gtd formalism has been applied to a number of thermodynamic systems in order to test the consistency of the programme . in this work ,",
    "we take a step forward and set ourselves to the task of finding those systems which exhibit constant _ thermodynamic _ interaction .",
    "that is , we will find the class of fundamental functions producing a manifold of constant curvature .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the two - dimensional case , i.e. we consider only systems with two degrees of freedom .",
    "these systems are interesting from the mathematical point of view since the any two dimensional metric can be cast into a conformally flat form .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "in section ii we present a brief account of the geometrothermodynamics programme and two - dimensional thermodynamic systems of constant curvature . in section",
    "iii we analyse the system of partial differential equations to find the set of isothermal coordinates for metrics with vanishing hessian curvature .",
    "there we propose a criterion to single out physical fundamental relations based on a circumference - like equation in an abstract space related to the system of differential equations for the isothermal coordinates . to close this section we present an example illustrating these matters",
    "finally , in section iv we present a summary of the results and address future work on the subject .",
    "the gtd programme promotes the natural formalism of thermodynamics in terms of contact manifolds to a legendre invariant riemannian structure .",
    "let us begin with a brief review of the programme by considering the case of two thermodynamic degrees of freedom . in this case , we need a five dimensional manifold which admits a set of local coordinates corresponding to the collection of extensive and intensive variables  denoted by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively  together with the thermodynamic potential , @xmath2 , such that the kernel of the 1-form [ theta ] = - p_1 q_1 - p_2 q_2 , generates a maximally non - integrable set of hyperplanes , @xmath3 .",
    "a manifold @xmath4 together with the 1-form @xmath5 is called a contact manifold . in the present case",
    "we refer to it as the _ thermodynamic phase - space_. of special interest is the maximal integral sub - manifold , @xmath6 , i.e. the largest sub - manifold which can be embedded in @xmath4 such that @xmath7 .",
    "it is easy to see that this is a two - dimensional manifold defined by the first law of thermodynamics = p_1 q_1 + p_2 q_2 , = ( q_1,q_2 ) p_i = _ , i .",
    "thus , we see that if we know the fundamental function @xmath8 , then we know how @xmath9 is embedded in @xmath4 .",
    "we call the sub - manifold @xmath9 the _ space of equilibrium states_.    in addition , the gtd programme introduces a metric structure for the thermodynamic phase space .",
    "such a structure is constructed in order to satisfy the criterion of legendre invariance , i.e. legendre transformations correspond to isometries . within the gtd programme",
    "there have been two distinct classes of metrics which have been studied according to their invariance properties , those which are invariant under every possible legendre transformation and those which are only invariant under _ total _ legendre transformations .",
    "the metric structure of @xmath4 induces a riemannian metric on @xmath9 , its first fundamental form , whose intrinsic curvature is associated with the thermodynamic interaction of the system . in our two - dimensional scenario , this whole information is contained in the curvature scalar of @xmath9 .",
    "if the curvature of the space of equilibrium states is to give a faithful account of the thermodynamic interaction , it should not depend on the choice of fundamental representation , i.e. one is free to work in the energy or entropy representation indistinctly .",
    "it has been shown that the metric compatible with both , legendre and representation invariance is [ gnatural ] g^= + ( q_1 p_1 + q_2 p_2 ) .",
    "thus , the induced metric on @xmath9 is simply given by [ gnat ] g^= ( q_1,q_2 ) h. here @xmath10 is the hessian metric h = _ , 11  q_1 q_1 + ( _ , 12 + _ , 21 )  q_1 q_2 + _ , 22  q_2 q_2 , where we have used a coma to denote partial differentiation with respect to the corresponding coordinate function of @xmath9 and the conformal factor is given by ( q_1,q_2 ) = .",
    "the interested reader in the derivation of the metric is referred to @xcite and to @xcite for applications to ordinary thermodynamic systems .",
    "note that the components of the metric depend on the second derivatives of the fundamental function @xmath2 but are otherwise unspecified .",
    "it is an interesting exercise to find a class of fundamental functions for which the space of equilibrium states @xmath9 becomes an einstein manifold for the metric .",
    "that is , we look for solutions of the system [ eins1 ] r^ _  ab = k g^",
    "_  ab , where @xmath11 is the ricci tensor associated with @xmath12 and @xmath13 is a constant , which in the present case corresponds to the gaussian curvature of @xmath9 .    it is worth noting that equation represents a system of three , _ third _ order , non - linear partial differential equations for the thermodynamic potential @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , it is straightforward to show that in two dimensions , the fourth order terms in the curvature exactly cancel whenever the metric is the hessian of a scalar function",
    ".    we can reduce the system by raising one of the indexes to obtain [ einseq0 ] r^_a^  b = k _ a^  b. thus , the system reduces to the single pde [ einseq ] f(_,i,_,ij,_,ijj,_,iii ) = 4 k i , j=1,2 . here @xmath14 is the determinant of the metric given by the expression = ^2(q_1,q_2 ) ( _ , 11_,22 - _ , 12 ^ 2 ) , andthe lhs of is @xmath15 where @xmath16    motivated by the results of a previous work by the authors ( c.f .",
    "section iii.d in @xcite and @xcite ) , we know that a solution to is given by the fundamental relation [ chap ] = _ 0 ( q_1^ + c  q_2^ ) . since we are working in two dimensions , the gaussian and scalar curvature are proportional and we see that the constancy of @xmath13 is satisfied and has the value [ constantk ] k = - .    thus , we can propose a general solution of the form [ gen.ansatz ] = f(q_1 + q_2 ) . here",
    "@xmath17 is a sufficiently differentiable function of the sum of the extensive parameters where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are constants .",
    "this type of ansatz does solve .",
    "however , a quick inspection to the metric determinant reveals the degeneracy of this case [ c.f .",
    "equation , below ] .",
    "therefore , let us propose the more general solution [ gensol ] = f (  q_1^ +  q_2^ ) , where @xmath20 is a constant different from one .",
    "now , the metric determinant is in general different from zero and has the form [ metdet ] = , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the first and second total derivatives of the fundamental relation evaluated at @xmath23 .",
    "now we can clearly see the degeneracy for @xmath24",
    ".    substituting our ansatz into the equation we obtain again the same result as in the case of , i.e the gaussian curvature is the same constant , equation , regardless of the particular form of the function @xmath17 as long as the argument is @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , the generalised chaplygin gas , equation belongs to a class of thermodynamic systems with the same type of interaction given by .",
    "moreover , the hessian metric for the logarithmic form of this type of fundamental relation has vanishing curvature . in this case",
    "it becomes a simpler problem to find the set of isothermal coordinates for the space of equilibrium states .",
    "it is a well known result that every two - dimensional riemannian manifold is conformally flat .",
    "that is , we can always find a set of coordinates for which the metric takes the form [ confflat ] g = ^2(x , y ) g^ , g^= x x + y y. such a coordinate system is called _ isothermal_. in this section we find the isothermal coordinates for the space of equilibrium states @xmath26 under the assumption of the hessian flatness , i.e. by demanding that the curvature scalar of the hessian part of the metric vanishes .",
    "let us consider the diffeomorphism @xmath27 accounting for the change of coordinates @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "then we can pull - back the metric @xmath30 [ c.f .",
    "equation ] and solve the equation [ eq : pb ] ^*g^- h = 0 for the coordinate functions @xmath31 , @xmath32 and the thermodynamic potential @xmath2 .",
    "this will provide us with a family of thermodynamic fundamental relations with zero hessian curvature together with their isothermal coordinates .",
    "equation above corresponds to the system of equations @xmath33    there is a large family of solutions for such a system .",
    "in particular , for separable fundamental relations , = s(q_1 ) + t(q_2 ) , we have that the change of coordinates is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a constant and the primes and dots denote differentiation with respect to @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "a more general solution is given by those fundamental functions satisfying the third order system of pde s [ gensoln1 ] _ , 211 = _ , 1,22 = .",
    "in this case , the isothermal coordinates must satisfy the system @xmath38 \\d q_1 .      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    one can verify that a fundamental relation of the form is a solution of . we have seen that this type of functions generates degenerate hessian metrics .",
    "however , we can use them to learn some properties about the space of solutions of the system - .",
    "for example , consider the fundamental relations given by [ soltest1 ] = ( q_1 + q_2 ) . in this case",
    "we can solve the pair of equations for @xmath31 , i.e. equations and to obtain x = c ( q_2 + q_1 ) , and substitution in yields y = ( q_1 + q_2 ) .",
    "thus we see that , indeed , this type of fundamental relation fails to produce a real change of coordinates satisfying .",
    "moreover , note that we can find particular solutions to the system - if we restrict ourselves to a circumference in an abstract xy plane .",
    "thus , we have [ cir.eq ] x^2 + y^2 = r^2 , where @xmath39 from this point of view , we observe that the fundamental relation corresponds to an ` imgainary ' radius of the circumference , that is [ radius ] r^2 = - .",
    "this is not surprising since we knew that the hessian corresponding to this fundamental relation is degenerate and thus the system is not well posed except for the case @xmath40 , for which @xmath41 .",
    "we can use this geometric construction to probe the space of solutions for a _ fixed _",
    "fundamental relation by noting that a solution to the system - must lie on the circumference associated with the particular fundamental relation we use [ c.f .",
    "equation ] , but not every solution lying on the circumference solves the system we are probing .      to see how this construction works , let us chose a family of fundamental relations in the form of equation parametrised by the exponent @xmath20 .",
    "we work in the entropy representation using molar quantities .",
    "thus we set by @xmath42 the specific energy and @xmath43 is the specific volume . the fundamental relation is written as s_= ( u^ + v^ ) .",
    "each of these functions defines a hessian metric of zero curvature and a natural metric of constant thermodynamic interaction [ c.f .",
    "equation ] .",
    "the change to isothermal coordinates for this type of functions can not be expressed analytically .",
    "however , we can use the circumference to classify the various types of differential equations obtained for each value of @xmath20 .",
    "the squared radii of the circles associated with each function is given by [ radius1 ] r^2_= - thus , fixing the volume of the system , we find the subset of fundamental functions for which the pde represented by the circumference is well defined .",
    "the three qualitatively different types of behaviour are depicted in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "it is easy to observe that for @xmath44 the pde is ill defined , thus , only fundamental relations for which @xmath45 are meaningful .",
    "this corresponds to a positive thermodynamic curvature as can be seen from .",
    "furthermore , noticing the symmetry of @xmath46 and @xmath47 in the expression for the circumference radius , it is easy to observe that the pde also restrict the domain of the thermodynamic variables to @xmath48 .",
    "the fundamental relation with @xmath45 describes a polytropic fluid with equation of state given by [ eos ] p = ^1- , where @xmath49 is the energy density of the fluid .",
    "it is a simple task to obtain the heat capacity at constant volume for these systems [ cv ] c_v = . from this expression",
    "we observe that the heat capacity remains finite for any value of the thermodynamic variables and is always negative whenever @xmath45 .",
    "are positive definite in the full physical domain , i.e. positive values of energy and volume .",

    "in this paper we studied two - dimensional einstein manifolds for the geometrothermodynamics programme .",
    "we found the differential equation that must be satisfied by the fundamental relation in order to describe a system with constant thermodynamic interacion , i.e. a fundamental relation producing a representation invariant metric whose associated curvature is constant . in particular , building on previous work ( c.f .",
    "reference @xcite ) we analysed the one - parameter family of fundamental relations given by equation .    noting the conformal structure of @xmath12 [ see equation ] , we centre our study in the class of functions whose associated hessian metric has vanishing curvature . with this assumption , we set up the system of differential equations defining the set of isothermal coordinates .",
    "as expected , we found an analytic expression for the change of coordinates for the case in which the fundamental function is separable .",
    "an interesting exercise allowed us to explore some properties of the space of solutions of , i.e. the set of isothermal coordinates with their corresponding fundamental relation of vanishing hessian curvature .    observing the algebraic structure of the system -",
    ", we note that there will be a class of fundamental relations satisfying the hessian curvature constraint for which we can build a characteristic circumference on which the solutions of the pde system lie .",
    "this can be done whenever the derivatives of the fundamental relation define a positive squared radial function .",
    "moreover , we conjecture that only the set of fundamental relations for which such a construction is possible can describe physical systems of constant thermodynamic interaction . in particular , we work out the example given by . here , we work in specific thermodynamic variables in the entropy representation of a system characterised by the exponent @xmath20 . indeed , only those systems for which @xmath45 correspond to a polytropic fundamental relation .    in sum",
