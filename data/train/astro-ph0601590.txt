    "the eridanus region contains a large nearby interstellar superbubble .",
    "this region was discovered as an extended @xmath4 x - ray ` hot spot ' @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the eridanus loop was identified as an expanding shell of h  i by @xcite and was extensively imaged in h-@xmath3 emission @xcite , revealing a large filamentary shell structure .",
    "@xcite argued that barnard s loop and the eridanus shell were both created by one or more supernovae in the orion ob association and were maintained by the intense stellar winds and ionizing radiation from those stars .",
    "_ rosat _ observations @xcite support the idea that the huge interstellar cavity is filled with several - million - degree gas",
    ". surveys of co @xcite show that the cavity is bounded in part by molecular gas .",
    "the co clouds generally coincide with h  i filaments ; however , on a smaller scale , the clouds are located where h  i is weak within the filament . in the fuv spectral range , early @xcite and improved @xcite spectral observations of diffuse emission from the eridanus loop over limited angular fields show that gas at intermediate temperatures , t@xmath5k , exists between the hot superbubble interior and the surrounding material .",
    "we present the first fuv spectral imaging observations of the entire eridanus loop .",
    "the data were obtained with the spectroscopy of plasma emission from astrophysical radiation ( _ spear _ ) , also known as the far - ultraviolet imaging spectrograph ( _ fims _ ) .",
    "these _ spear _ data show h@xmath6 fluorescent emission throughout the eridanus loop field and provide new insights into the geometry and physical conditions of the molecular environment around this superbubble .",
    "the eridanus region was observed with _ spear _ , the main payload of the korean satellite , stsat-1 , which was launched on september 27 , 2003 .",
    "_ spear _ is a dual - channel fuv imaging spectrograph ( s channel @xmath7@xmath8 , l channel @xmath9@xmath10 , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 refers to the half energy width ) with a large field of view ( s : @xmath13 , l : @xmath14 , angular resolution@xmath15 ) optimized for the observation of diffuse emissions .",
    "see @xcite for an overview of the instrument , mission , and data analysis .",
    "the region bounded by @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 , covering most of the constellations orion and eridanus , was observed using more than 16 ks of exposure taken between 26 december 2003 and 26 january 2004 .",
    "the observation geometry is shown in figure [ fig1 ] , along with an h-@xmath3 survey map .",
    "the h-@xmath3 features most prominent around the eridanus supershell are barnard s loop , the i orion o - association molecular cloud complex , the h ii region surrounding @xmath20 ori centered at @xmath21 , and h-@xmath3 filamentary structures .",
    "barnard s loop and the @xmath20 ori region were excluded from the _ spear _ observation to avoid excessive count rates . for the ensuing data analysis ,",
    "the region was divided , based on the h-@xmath3 emission features , into subregions labeled as 1 through 6 ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we identified bright stars in our observations by examining an fuv sky intensity map , created by accumulating photons and exposure into @xmath22 sky bins .",
    "stars were identified by matching features , within @xmath23 , to the position of uv bright stars in the tycho-2 catalog @xcite .",
    "photons within @xmath24 of the identified stars were removed from the data set to obtain the residual diffuse emission and to minimize stellar contamination . after excluding the contributions of uv bright stars , @xmath25 of @xmath26 detected photons remained .",
    "these photons were accumulated , for each subregion , into spectra that were binned to 2 , shown in figure [ fig2](a)(f ) , along with the noise levels per spectral bin .",
    "an inherent detector background of @xmath27 counts / s /  was measured during interleaved shutter - closed periods and was subtracted from these spectra .",
    "the eridanus 13501630 spectra show emission features that correspond to the h@xmath6 fluorescence predictions of @xcite , notably the prominent bands near 1605 .",
    "other prominent features were identified with atomic lines such as c  iv at 1550 and si  ii at 1530 ( see @xcite for a discussion of atomic emission in the eridanus loop . ) . to investigate the physical conditions of the h@xmath6 , a photo dissociation region ( pdr ) radiation code @xcite",
    "was used to generate a model fuv spectrum .",
    "the continuum level was taken to be a linear function of wavelength , and the sensitivity of the fitting while varying the slope and y - intercept of the continuum was investigated based on the @xmath28 minimization method .",
    "the fit models for each subregion are shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "there are several physical parameters which affect the resultant spectrum : cloud density , excitation temperature , total hydrogen molecule column density , and radiation field ; we varied only the excitation temperature in our model with other parameters fixed . for example , ultraviolet fluorescent emission of h@xmath6 is produced following the absorption of photons in the lyman ( b @xmath29  x @xmath30 ) and werner ( c @xmath31  x @xmath30 ) bands . hence , the stars in the i orion ob association were considered as the likely and dominant source of h@xmath6 emission . the total radiation field from the most luminous stars of the i orion association @xcite accounts for the presumed radiation field scale factor @xcite of @xmath32 , assuming that the distance from the association is @xmath33 pc and there is no extinction .",
    "@xcite estimated the electron volume density , @xmath34 , of the ionized gas in the eridanus superbubble to be 0.8 @xmath35 , which corresponds to the thermal pressure , @xmath36 @xmath35k , in the ionized gas .",
    "the density of the neutral gas was adjusted to have the equilibrium thermal pressure , @xmath36 @xmath35k , according to the excitation temperature , which is used as a parameter in our model .",
    "the fractional abundance of h@xmath6 , defined as @xmath37 $ ] , was assumed to have an average value of 0.17 , as obtained from the _ copernicus _ observations @xcite .",
    "the color temperature of the incident radiation was assumed to be @xmath38 k.    with these parameters fixed , the molecular cloud excitation temperature was varied to investigate the sensitivity of the model spectrum compared to the observed data .",
    "the model spectrum was scaled to match the average observed intensity over the 13501650 spectral region , where h@xmath6 emission was apparent in both the model and the data .",
    "the 1356 airglow line did not appear in the observed spectrum .",
    "the sensitivity of the @xmath28 value to the parameters comes from the relative intensity variations of each vibrational transition band , which are governed by the distribution of h@xmath6 among the vibrational excitation states in the electronic ground state ( x @xmath30 ) .",
    "for example , the intensity ratio , @xmath1 , increases monotonically from 0.65 to 0.8 as the excitation temperature increases to 1,000 k , according to our model .",
    "thus , a unique excitation temperature can be determined if the line ratios are measured .",
    "the results for each subregion , the maximum fluorescent emission intensity , @xmath39 , the continuum intensity @xmath40 , and the intensity ratio , @xmath1 , are listed in table [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "the model spectra with t@xmath41 k and t@xmath42 k are plotted for region 4 in figure [ fig2](g ) , with the observed spectrum . as can be seen in the figure , most of the lines in the spectral range are identified as lyman bound - bound transitions ( bx @xmath43 ) , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 represent the vibrational excitation of a hydrogen molecule at each respective excitation state .",
    "the observed spectrum best fits with a cloud excitation temperature of 1,000 k , with @xmath46 = 2.2 , though the signal - to - noise ratio of our observation was not sufficient to discriminate the excitation temperature accurately .",
    "our detection of h@xmath2 fluorescence in eridanus is consistent with previous observations in other locations in that fluorescence is found where h@xmath2 is exposed to a strong uv radiation field .",
    "the correlations among the subregions fluorescent emission intensity , the h-@xmath3 emission intensity , and the color excess value are shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "the h@xmath2 fluorescence intensity shows a strong correlation with both the h-@xmath3 emission intensity and the color excess .",
    "this suggests that the h-@xmath3 emission and hydrogen molecular fluorescence have similar physical origins and are governed globally by a strong and similar uv radiation field , likely arising from the i orion ob association .",
    "we expect that the h@xmath2 abundance is proportional to that of both hydrogen atoms and dust particles , since dust particles are known as the main birth place of h@xmath2 in the interstellar medium .",
    "the most conspicuous features in the h-@xmath3 emission map shown in figure [ fig1 ] , are the filamentary structures elongated along @xmath47(arc a ; region 3 ) and @xmath48(arc b ; region 5 ) .",
    "it appears from figure [ fig3](a ) and ( b ) , and from figure [ fig1 ] , that uv photons from the orion ob association undergo extinction by the arc a and arc b filaments , since region 6 shows relatively low h-@xmath3 and h@xmath2 fluorescence , while having a color excess value comparable to those of region 1 , 2 , and 5 .",
    "the h@xmath2 fluorescent emission from region 5 ( arc b ) is relatively high among regions with comparable dust extinction ( regions 2 and 6 ) , and it is similar to that of region 4 , even though the dust extinction for region 4 is higher and the line - of - sight distance to the i orion ob fuv sources is likely smaller .",
    "this observation can be explained if the gas in region 3 ( arc a ) is not in the line of sight that extends from the radiation source ( the i orion ob association ) to the gas in region 5 ( arc b ) , i.e. , the distances to arcs a and b are different and the eridanus shell structure is open from the i orion to arc b. this geometry is consistent with the considerations of @xcite and @xcite in that both studies argue that arcs a and b are part of a complex of individual shells viewed along the same line of sight but at different distances ( arc a @xmath49500pc , arc b @xmath50150pc ) .",
    "the observational results do not rule out reynolds and ogden s ( 1979 ) description , in that the both arc a and arc b can still be exposed to the radiation from the i orion ob association that causes the h@xmath2 fluorescent emission .",
    "the fuv continuum intensity does not show a strong correlation with h-@xmath3 emission or h@xmath2 fluorescent emission intensities ( see table [ tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "instead , the continuum intensity seems closely tied to the geometry of the region .",
    "the strong continuum of region 1 can be attributed to the proximity of region 1 to the radiation source .",
    "region 3 is remarkable in that it shows both a strong continuum intensity and a strong h@xmath2 fluorescent emission intensity .",
    "the observationally derived shell expansion velocity of the eridanus region , of between 15 and 23 km s@xmath51 @xcite is consistent with the survival of the h@xmath6 in the eridanus region .",
    "the observed @xmath52 value suggests the existence of high - temperature molecular gas in the region . according to @xcite , when an interstellar shock with @xmath53 km / s is running into molecular gas with a density of @xmath54 @xmath55 , the region in which the gas temperature exceeds 200 k will extend only @xmath56 cm , implying that interstellar shocks are not good at producing large column densities of warm gas . an alternative explanation , for the heating of molecular gas , might be selective uv excitation by uv lines radiated by the hot gas in the bubble , or it may be that other heating mechanisms are able to raise the gas temperature where uv pumping of the h@xmath6 is taking place .",
    "further studies are needed to clarify the contribution and role of uv radiation , supernova shocks , and other possible heating mechanisms .    in summary",
    ", we have presented the first detection of h@xmath2 fluorescence in the eridanus region .",
    "the fluorescence emission features , with a pdr spectrum prediction model , imply the possible existence of molecular gas with an excitation temperature as high as 1,000 k , which is about an order of magnitude higher than excitation temperatures generally found for molecular gases in the galactic disk @xcite .",
    "we note that high - excitation temperature h@xmath2 has also been detected in high - velocity shocked gas associated with the monoceros loop @xcite and in a galactic translucent cloud @xcite .",
    "the observed spectrum of the h@xmath2 fluorescence in the eridanus region is different in that a substantial column density of h@xmath2 ( @xmath57 @xmath55 ) is required to produce the observed fluorescence .",
    "thus , most of the h@xmath2 undergoing photon pumping must have a high rotational temperature , if collisional excitation is to account for the observed fluorescent feature ratios . a more rigorous observation and model study",
    "are expected to reveal the physical conditions of the molecular gas in the eridanus supershell .",
