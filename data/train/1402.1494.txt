    "it often happened in high energy physics that previously discovered particles later became the `` standard candles '' , and led to the discoveries of new particles .",
    "for example , the @xmath0 and @xmath2 gauge bosons were discovered by identifying the leptons they decay to ; they ( especially the @xmath2 boson ) in turn played important roles in the discovery of the higgs boson at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite .",
    "it is our hope that at the lhc and future colliders , we will be able to find new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , again by first identifying particles that we are already familiar with .",
    "therefore , it is crucial that we are able to efficiently identify all known particles , or , equivalently , their masses and quantum numbers .",
    "this is a difficult task when the particle is a qcd parton , namely a quark or a gluon , or when it decays to qcd partons . in these cases ,",
    "what we see in a collider detector is one or more energetic jets that contain multiple hadrons , and their identities are concealed .",
    "there are several handles one can utilize to distinguish jets from different origins : the jet mass or multi - jet invariant mass is determined by the original parton s mass ( for convenience , in this article we use the term `` parton '' to refer to either a qcd parton or a massive particle that decays to qcd partons ) ; a massive hadronically decaying particle , such as a @xmath0 or @xmath2 boson , results in more than one jets with similar momenta , which is different from a usual qcd jet originated from a single quark or gluon ; finally , the qcd quantum number determines the amount of jet radiation and how it is distributed .",
    "the first two handles have been used routinely in high energy experiments , while the last , though receiving significant amount of studies recently , has not been used as commonly .",
    "part of the reason is , compared with the hard kinematics , the radiation information of a jet is often associated with soft particles , making it more vulnerable to various contaminations , including the underlying event , pileup , as well as radiation from nearby jets .",
    "we will focus on tackling this difficulty in this article .",
    "variables sensitive to the jet radiation are calculated from jet constituents . on the one hand",
    ", we would like to choose a larger jet radius such that more radiation from the initial parton is included to give us more color information ; on the other hand , we would like to avoid introducing excessive contamination , and a smaller radius is preferred .",
    "therefore , a careful choice of the jet radius is important .",
    "similar considerations have been made in refs .",
    "@xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , it is shown that the optimum jet radius is around @xmath3 for jet @xmath4 at a hadron collider , where the effects of the underlying event and hadronization are minimized , and it yields the optimum @xmath5 mass measurement for the ua2 experiment .",
    "the study has been extended to the lhc in refs .",
    "@xcite where the criterion for optimizing the jet radius is to obtain the best mass resolution for new massive hadronically decaying resonances .",
    "the purpose of those studies is to properly reconstruct the kinematics , _",
    "i.e. _ , the momenta of the partons initiating the observed jets .",
    "our goal is different : we want to choose the jet radius such that the discrimination power , including that from the jet radiation patterns , is maximized . for this purpose , it is important to study the distribution of the `` intrinsic '' radiation , _ i.e. _ , the radiation originated from the initial parton instead of the contaminations .",
    "in particular , it is helpful to know what is the amount of the intrinsic radiation contained in a cone of a particular size around the jet axis .",
    "nonetheless , there is not a unique definition of the `` amount '' of radiation , and the radiation distribution depends on various factors such as the color configuration , the boost to the system , _",
    "etc._.    in this article , we give a rigorous definition of the jet _ radiation radius _ , taking the simplest case as the start point : a dijet color singlet system .",
    "roughly speaking , the jet radiation radius , @xmath6 , is the jet radius one needs to include on average a fraction of @xmath7 of the total radiation in the jet .",
    "a variable that quantifies the amount of radiation is needed in this definition , such as thrust , girth @xcite , or @xmath8-subjettiness @xcite .",
    "we study the dependence of @xmath6 on the jet qcd quantum number and the jet momentum .",
    "we examine two applications , quark - gluon discrimination and @xmath0 jet tagging , and show that knowledge of the jet radiation radius can help us achieve the optimum discrimination power .",
    "interestingly , in both cases , the jet radiation radius , and thus the optimum ( sub)jet radius decreases with increasing jet momentum , albeit for different reasons . for a quark or gluon jet produced from a color singlet system in its ( nearly ) rest frame ,",
    "the jet momentum is roughly proportional to the center of mass energy , which determines the amount of radiation and how it is distributed .",
    "it is well known that the qcd coupling constant decreases when the energy scale increases , resulting in smaller radiation radius .",
    "we will see that the radiation radius approximately follows a power law dependence on the jet momentum , with the power being around @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , to reduce the contaminations , we are able to use a smaller cone size to evaluate jet radiation variables for higher jet momentum .    for the case of a boosted @xmath0 boson ( or other massive color singlet particles ) , the radiation scale is fixed to the @xmath0 mass , while the boost makes the radiated particles collimated .",
    "this results in a radiation radius inversely proportional to the jet momentum , or subjet momentum if the @xmath0 is identified as a single jet . in light of that",
    ", we propose a new @xmath0 tagging algorithm to deal with high pileup . in this algorithm , we start as usual with a fat jet that contains a @xmath0 boson or its qcd counterpart , and use a jet grooming method @xcite to reconstruct the kinematics of the @xmath0 decay .",
    "then , when calculating a jet radiation variable , we use two much smaller cones around the two leading subjets axes , with the cone sizes inversely proportional to the subjets @xmath1 s . with this `` shrinking cone '' algorithm",
    ", we find a 30% ( 60% ) improvement in the statistical significance for jet @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , when the average number of pileup events is 60 , compared with methods not using the shrinking cones .",
    "the rest of the article is organized as follows . in section [ sec : definition ] , we give the definition of the jet radiation radius . in section [ sec : quark - gluon ] , we discuss the difference in the radiation radius between a quark jet and a gluon jet in a dijet color singlet system , and demonstrate that the optimum jet radius for quark - gluon discrimination decreases for increasing jet @xmath1 . section [ sec : wtag ] is devoted to the discussion of the radiation radius in a boosted system , and in particular its role in @xmath0 jet tagging .",
    "section [ sec : discussions ] contains some discussions .",
    "a jet has a finite radius precisely because of the qcd radiation and hadronization .",
    "therefore , it seems redundant to have a definition of a _",
    "radiation radius_. however , the usual purpose of using a finite radius for jet clustering is to ensure most of the jet radiation is included in the jet such that one can infer the initial partons momenta correctly . for this purpose ,",
    "the radiation gives us difficulties rather than provides us useful information .",
    "moreover , due to collinear singularity , the momentum of a jet is concentrated in the core , that is , the center of the jet .",
    "therefore , it is not essential to control precisely the jet radius , and multiple choices of jet radius coexist in high energy experiments . for the purpose of determining the quantum number of a jet ,",
    "the information from the qcd radiation is essential and one should be more careful about choosing the optimum jet radius . as mentioned in the introduction , this is particularly important when the jet is contaminated by other hadronic activities in the event , including the underlying event , pileup and radiation from nearby jets .",
    "therefore , it is useful to define a jet radiation radius , which is a measure of how the radiation is distributed . knowing the `` intrinsic '' , _",
    "i.e. , _ uncontaminated , jet radiation radii corresponding to partons with different quantum numbers will allow us to have a generic understanding of how to choose a jet radius to better deal with the contaminations .",
    "as we will show later , it also allows us to engineer new algorithms that provide better discrimination powers .",
    "the first jet definition was given by sterman and weinberg @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a hadronic event from an @xmath12 collision is classified as a two jet event if at least a fraction of @xmath13 of the event s total energy is contained in two cones of opening half - angle @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a small fraction .",
    "obviously , for fixed @xmath15 , when we increase @xmath14 , the fraction of hadronic events that are classified as two jets , @xmath16 , will also increase . at the next leading order",
    ", @xmath16 is given by @xcite @xmath17+\\frac{\\pi^2}{12}-\\frac{7}{16}-\\epsilon+\\frac{3}{2}\\epsilon^2+o(\\delta^2\\ln\\epsilon)\\right\\}. \\label{eq : f2}\\ ] ] when @xmath15 is small , we keep only the leading term and find @xmath18 .",
    "\\label{eq : deltaq}\\ ] ] in eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltaq ] ) , we have added a subscript `` @xmath19 '' because hadronic events in an @xmath12 machine are dominated by quark - antiquark pairs . in such a machine ,",
    "the event is not contaminated by the underlying event and initial state qcd radiation , and two - jet events are dominantly initiated from a pair of back - to - back high energy quarks . therefore , @xmath20 can be viewed as the `` intrinsic '' size of a quark jet . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltaq ] ) , we see the definition of the size @xmath20 depends on two parameters , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "similarly , if the system under study is initiated from two hard gluons ( in the color singlet configuration ) , we obtain the angular size , @xmath21 , of a gluon jet . at the leading order , @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath20 or @xmath21 is a measure of how the radiation is distributed , which is sensitive to the partons color structure .",
    "this motivates us to give a general definition of a jet _ radiation _ radius , by replacing the energy fraction @xmath13 with a measure of the amount of radiation .",
    "the definition of the amount of radiation is not unique , and suitable choices include thrust ( denoted @xmath23 ) , charged particle multiplicity ( denoted @xmath24 ) , @xmath8-subjettiness , _",
    "etc_.    while a possible definition of the jet radiation radius could be given following the definition of the variable @xmath14 , in practice it is perhaps more convenient to use the following definition .",
    "_ in a 2(or @xmath8)-jet color singlet system in its center of mass frame , a jet radiation radius is defined as the jet radius that the average amount of radiation within the 2 ( or n ) jets is a fraction of @xmath7 of the average total radiation . _    in practice , the jet radiation radius can be calculated as follows . for a given ensemble of events , to get the fraction @xmath7",
    ", we first calculate the average `` total '' radiation : for an @xmath12 machine , it may include all particles in the event ; while for a hadron collider , we may use a set of jets clustered with a large radius as the start point .",
    "then we use a ( smaller ) radius @xmath25 to recluster the jets and find the amount of radiation within the leading 2 ( or n ) jets , also averaged over the ensemble .",
    "the fraction @xmath7 is the radio of the two averages , and the corresponding @xmath25 is our jet radiation radius .",
    "we denote the radiation radius by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , is a measure of the amount of radiation .",
    "a few comments of the above definition is in place .",
    "first , there are multiple choices of the variables that can quantify the amount of radiation . to be a good candidate",
    ", the variable should satisfy : @xmath28 it is ( near ) zero when there is no radiation .",
    "@xmath29 it increases monotonously when the jet radius is increased , and approaches a finite value when the jet radius is taken to be infinity , _",
    "i.e. _ , when all particles in the event ( or the part of the event being studied ) are included .",
    "we easily see that among the most commonly used variables , jet mass is a good radiation variable , while jet momentum is not .",
    "other radiation variables include @xmath30 where @xmath23 is the thrust , charged particle multiplicity , @xmath8-subjettiness , _",
    "etc_. second , the requirement of a color singlet system is to guarantee the jet radius is not affected by particles outside the system , otherwise the definition is ambiguous .",
    "moreover , we have also required the system to be in the center of mass frame such that it is reasonable to use a common jet radius for all jets in the system .",
    "even with this requirement , when the system contains more than 2 jets with different momenta , we still need a prescription on how to choose the jet radii  this is not a concern in this article because we will only discuss dijet systems .",
    "as we will see , when a dijet system is boosted , the two jets will have different momenta and it is desirable to use different radii for them .    in this article , we will rely on pythia 8 @xcite simulations to calculate the jet radiation radius , leaving analytical calculations to future studies .",
    "we start from the simplest case : dijet color - singlet systems .",
    "there are two possibilities for the initial partons , @xmath31 or @xmath32 . given the large number of variables that have been proposed in the literature",
    ", we will only consider a few of them that are particular useful for our later discussions : charged particle multiplicity , girth and @xmath8-subjettiness . charged particle multiplicity is simply the number of charged particles passing a certain @xmath1 threshold , or the number of tracks in the jet .",
    "girth is defined as @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the distance in the @xmath35 plane between particle ( or jet constituent ) @xmath36 and the jet axis . here",
    ", @xmath37 is the rapidity .",
    "note the variable contains a normalization factor , @xmath38 , which is the jet @xmath1 . as described in the previous section",
    ", we will need to calculate the `` total radiation '' starting from a fat jet ( or , for the @xmath12 case , starting from all particles in a hemisphere ) , as well as the radiation for a variety of smaller jet radius .",
    "then it is a question whether we should use the @xmath1 of the fat jet ( or half of the center of mass energy for an @xmath12 machine ) as a common normalization factor for all jet radii , or use the jet @xmath1 of the corresponding radius .",
    "both choices are valid , although there are subtle differences between them .",
    "we find the latter is more convenient and more commonly used , which we will stick to in the following discussions .",
    "@xmath8-subjettiness is derived from @xmath8-jettiness @xcite , and defined as follows @xcite .",
    "we define a distance measure between a particle @xmath39 and an axis @xmath40 as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 , and @xmath43 is a constant . then for @xmath8-axes",
    "we define @xmath44 namely , for each particle in the jet , we find the nearest axis and calculate the @xmath1 weighted distance .",
    "then @xmath45 is a sum of the distances over all particles in the jet , normalized by a factor @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the jet radius . finally , we find the @xmath8-axes such that @xmath45 is minimized , and the minimum value is called @xmath8-subjettiness and denoted @xmath48 .    when @xmath49 and @xmath50 , we see that 1-subjettiness , @xmath51 , is defined very similar to girth , with slight differences in the distance measure ( girth uses the rapidity @xmath37 while @xmath51 uses the pseudorapidity @xmath52 ) and the normalization factor .",
    "therefore , the discussion on girth applies to @xmath51 as well . in general , these variables are examples of a set of variables called _ radial moments _ @xcite that are all valid radiation variables : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a function of @xmath55 , such as @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57  .",
    "although it will be infrared / collinear unsafe , we may also generalize the definition to allow a non - linear dependence on @xmath58 , for example , by making the sum over @xmath59 .",
    "then the particle multiplicity can be viewed as a special case where @xmath60 .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , it is convenient to study events from @xmath12 collisions , where we only have final state qcd radiation emitted from the partons being studied .",
    "therefore , we study the processes @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "we fix the pseudorapidity of the two outgoing partons to @xmath63 , _",
    "i.e. _ , perpendicular to the beam , and use pythia 8 for showering and hadronization . for an @xmath12 machine ,",
    "it is better to use the spherical coordinates .",
    "nevertheless , we eventually would like to extend our results to a hadron collider , so we will use the @xmath64 coordinates for convenience .",
    "we then apply the anti-@xmath65 algorithm with various @xmath25 s for jet clustering , using fastjet @xcite .",
    "it is known that the anti-@xmath65 algorithm gives us circular jets , which mimic cones of size @xmath25 around the jet axes . since all contaminations are proportional to the area of the jet , we draw the radiation variables as a function of @xmath66 in fig .  [",
    "fig : vars_ee ] for better illustration .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : vars_ee ] that the radiation variables grow much faster at smaller @xmath66 s than larger @xmath66 s , and eventually saturate at very large @xmath66 s .",
    "this indicates that increasing @xmath25 beyond a certain value will only introduce more contaminations rather than provide more information , therefore , an optimum radius should exist .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     .[fig : roc_150],scaledwidth=70.0% ]",
    "in this article , we have given a definition of the jet radiation radius , which quantifies the size of a jet due to its qcd radiation .",
    "this definition is closely related to the jet shape ( also known as jet profile ) variable which measures , on average , the fraction of momentum that is included in a cone of size @xmath25 around the jet axis . for the purpose of studying the jet radiation distribution ,",
    "momentum is not a good measure because a large ( small ) momentum does not correspond to large ( small ) amount of radiation .",
    "therefore , in our definition , we have replaced it with variables that directly measure the amount of radiation .",
    "moreover , we have emphasized the nature of the radiation radius being _ intrinsic _ , _ i.e. _ , it is a characteristic of a parton with a definite qcd quantum , and should not change across different production processes and experimental setups . in particular , it is defined before various contaminations are included . it is our hope that by `` factorizing '' the contributions to jet shape variables into intrinsic and environmental ones , we can simplify jet substructure studies and use jet radiation patterns more efficiently to distinguish jets with different quantum numbers .",
    "a key observation in this article is : in order to efficiently use jet radiation variables , a smaller than usual jet radius is often preferred .",
    "this is particularly true for the @xmath0 jet tagging method we proposed , where shrinking cones are used when calculating jet radiation variables . in a high energy experiment , either a simpler or a more complicated method may be adopted . on the one hand , due to the limitation in granularities , especially those of the hadronic calorimeter , one may not be able to use a jet radius smaller than @xmath67 , or / and may not be able to use continuous jet radii in the calculation . in that case , we may choose to simplify the method by choosing a few typical , but small , cone sizes .",
    "it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : roc_300 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : roc_150 ] that increasing the jet radius within a sizable region will not significantly hurt the discrimination power . on the other hand , one does see the advantages of using small cones , for example , @xmath68 is preferred for subjet @xmath69 when the average number of pileup events is 60 . an even smaller radius might be preferred if the pileup level is higher . therefore , ideally we would want to use the finest granularity for jet constituents , including the information from the electromagnetic calorimeter and the tracking system as in the particle flow approach @xcite .",
    "moreover , we have sticked to a single choice of ( sub)jet radius for each ( sub)jet in this article .",
    "similar to ref .",
    "@xcite , one may benefit from using two or more radii for each ( sub)jet , which not only gives us the information of how much the radiation is , but also captures how it grows with increasing @xmath25 .",
    "the shrinking cone algorithm we proposed for @xmath0 tagging is parallel and complementary to other pileup reduction methods and may be combined to obtain the optimum results .",
    "we have already used it with the pileup subtraction method proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where we see the subtraction method is convenient to extract the kinematic information while the shrinking cone method is more useful to obtain the radiation information .",
    "another set of useful techniques utilize the fact that a charged particle from a pileup event leaves a track not originated from the primary vertex , thus it can be subtracted from the jet .",
    "these methods include charged hadron subtraction @xcite , using a jet vertex fraction @xcite cut and jet cleansing @xcite .",
    "one may even use the charged particles from the primary vertex alone when calculation radiation variables , which still provides us a lot of information for the color structure @xcite . to improve over these method , one may simply apply them for cones with sizes determined by the ( sub)jet @xmath1 s , as discussed in this article . here , we emphasize that even if we only use tracks from the primary vertex to avoid most of the contamination from pileup events , it is still useful to optimize the jet cone sizes . we have seen that it is the case for quark - gluon discrimination when pileup is turned off .",
    "we expect this consideration to be more important when dealing with events with many hard partons , where jets can be easily contaminated by nearby radiation and a large jet radius should be avoided .",
    "this happens in , for example , susy cascades with long decay chains .",
