    "the hadronic vacuum polarization function @xmath3 and the adler function @xmath4 are physical observables of central importance in various fields of elementary particle physics .",
    "in particular , these quantities are essential for the analysis of strong interaction processes such as electron  positron annihilation into hadrons  @xcite and @xmath5  lepton decay  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the adler function plays an important role when confronting precise experimental measurements of some electroweak observables with their theoretical predictions , giving rise to decisive tests of the standard model and furnishing stringent constraints on possible new physics beyond it .",
    "specifically , due to the hadronic excitations in the photon vacuum polarization , the muon anomalous magnetic moment  @xcite and the shift of the electromagnetic fine structure constant  @xcite receive appreciable contributions from the strong interactions .",
    "the latter constitute in fact the main source of theoretical uncertainty when computing these observables , since the physical energy scales involved are such that the nonperturbative effects begin to be relevant .    to date",
    ", there is no systematic method for calculating the adler function in the whole range of energies @xmath2 .",
    "nonetheless , in the asymptotic ultraviolet region @xmath4 may be approximated by the power series in the strong running coupling  @xmath6 by making use of perturbation theory .",
    "however , unphysical singularities of  @xmath6 ( e.g. , the one  loop landau pole ) , being artifacts of the perturbative computations , invalidate this approach in the infrared domain . in turn",
    ", this significantly complicates the theoretical description of low  energy experimental data , and eventually forces one to resort to various models and phenomenologically inspired approximations .",
    "the `` semi  experimental '' method for obtaining the adler function in the infrared domain is to actually employ the data on the @xmath1ratio of @xmath7 annihilation into hadrons , in conjunction with the dispersion relation  @xcite .",
    "specifically , one first constructs @xmath8 by merging its low  energy experimental data with its high  energy perturbative prediction , and then integrates the dispersion relation for the adler function  @xcite .",
    "this way of modeling of the @xmath1ratio entails certain complications .",
    "in particular , one has to properly take into account the effects due to the analytical continuation of the perturbative results for @xmath4 into the timelike domain ( such as the resummation of the so  called @xmath9terms , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and resolve the ambiguities related to the matching condition between the experimental and perturbative inputs for  @xmath8 .",
    "in addition , the @xmath7 data are not always suitable for the extraction of the adler function , basically due to large systematic uncertainties in the infrared domain .",
    "nevertheless , recent progress in the study of the @xmath5  lepton decays offers a way to overcome the latter difficulty .",
    "specifically , for the energies below the mass of the @xmath5  lepton , the @xmath7 data can be substituted ( up to isospin breaking effects  @xcite ) by a precise inclusive vector spectral function  @xcite , extracted from the hadronic @xmath5  decays .",
    "it is worthwhile to note also that some insights on the infrared behavior of  @xmath4 may be gained from chiral perturbation theory ( see , e.g. , paper  @xcite and references therein ) and lattice simulations  @xcite .",
    "an important source of the nonperturbative information about the hadron dynamics at low energies is provided by the relevant dispersion relations .",
    "the latter , being based on the general principles of the local quantum field theory ( qft ) , supply one with the definite analytic properties in a kinematic variable of a physical quantity at hand .",
    "the idea of employing this information together with the perturbative treatment of the renormalization group ( rg ) method forms the underlying concept of the so  called `` analytic approach '' to qft .",
    "it was first proposed in the framework of the quantum electrodynamics and applied to the study of the invariant charge of the theory  @xcite .",
    "later on , it was argued ( see , e.g. , papers  @xcite and references therein ) that a similar method can also be useful for studying the non  abelian theories .",
    "eventually , proceeding from these motivations , the analytic approach to quantum chromodynamics  ( qcd ) has been developed  @xcite .",
    "some of the main advantages of this method are the absence of the unphysical singularities and a fairly good higher  loop and scheme stability of outcoming results .",
    "the analytic approach has been successfully employed in studies of the strong running coupling  @xcite , perturbative series for qcd observables ( the so  called `` analytic perturbation theory '' ( apt ) , see papers  @xcite and references therein ) , hadron spectrum  @xcite , pion form factor  @xcite , and some other intrinsically nonperturbative aspects of the strong interaction  @xcite .",
    "the primary objective of this paper is to derive novel integral representations for the adler function and the @xmath1ratio in a general framework of the analytic approach to qcd .",
    "these representations contain the nonperturbative information captured in the dispersion relation for @xmath4 , the effects due to the interrelation between spacelike and timelike domains , and the effects due to the nonvanishing pion mass .",
    "in addition , we compute the adler function within the approach at hand , by employing its perturbative approximation as the only additional input , and compare the obtained result with the relevant experimental data .    the layout of the paper is as follows . in sec .",

    "indeed , since the perturbation theory and the rg method are not applicable directly to the study of the observables depending on the timelike kinematic variable , for the self  consistent description of the latter one first has to relate the timelike experimental data with the perturbative results .",

    "finally , again in the framework of massless apt , the infrared behavior of the adler function has been brought into qualitative agreement with experiment , but at the expense of resorting to additional assumptions , such as the vector meson dominance  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , in this paper we have omitted effects due to the quark masses .",
    "of course , this is not to say that such effects are not relevant . as a matter of fact , and in addition to their role in bringing the predictions of apt in agreement with experiment , as exemplified in @xcite , they could be of relevance even within the approach at hand . in particular , in the present analysis such effects",
    "can be retained by employing the perturbative prediction for the adler function , which accounts for the quark masses ( see paper  @xcite and references therein ) , instead of @xmath75 given by eq .",
