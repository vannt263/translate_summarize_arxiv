    "our lensing simulations indicate that the typical image stretching ( longest to shortest length ratio ) may be a few times @xmath137 for a source magnified by @xmath74 . adopting a stretching factor of 300",
    "would then imply an angular source size of 0.08along the most extended direction for a 1 pc source at @xmath33 , which makes it marginally resolved in jwst / nircam imaging ( psf full width half maximum 0.07at 2@xmath38 m ) . in the case of wish imaging , the source may attain an intrisic size a few times higher while still remaining point - like ( psf full width half maximum 0.3at 2@xmath38 m ) . the exact contribution from nebular emission across this central object will depend on the surface brightness distribution of the nebula ( in turn depending on its spatial density distribution of photoionzed gas and the escape fraction of ionizing photons ) , the telescope psf and on the exact magnification distribution across the system .",
    "more detailed lensing simulations would be required to study this in detail .",
    "if it turns out that the nebular contribution across the central star cluster will typically be negligible ( or can be corrected for ) , then even a null result in a survey like the wish uds would provide important information on the star - forming properties of atomic cooling halos .",
    "if no very blue , extremely magnified objects are detected , this would indicate that fewer atomic halos than predicted are metal - free , or that the the star formation efficiency in such systems places them below the photometric detection threshold of the survey .",
    "how would these extremely magnified pop iii star clusters be identified among the huge number of more mundane objects in an automated catalog based on a deep , wide - area survey like the wish uds ? by combining drop - out criteria ( indicating high redshift ) with requirements for substantial elongation ( as expected for a gravitational arc ) , one is still likely to be faced with large numbers of interlopers in the form of edge - on disk galaxies , `` chain galaxies '' , and blended objects .",
    "however , many of these contaminants can be weeded out by either requiring the presence of other highly elongated objects within a few arcminutes ( as expected along the critical curve of a galaxy cluster lens ) or by demanding high curvature of the elongated structure ( as expected when the lens is a single galaxy ) . by comparing object colours derived in differently - sized apertures , objects with strong colour gradients ( as expected for the blue core on extended red nebula discussed in sect .  [ morphology ] ) can be singled out as promising candidates . among these",
    ", the most interesting objects should be the ones with the bluest colours ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . despite the unusual morphology expected for these extremely magnified pop iii objects , rare interlopers that superficially resemble these may however still turn up in large surveys . a cool foreground star that happens to be superposed on",
    "the gravitationally lensed arc of a high - redshift galaxy could mimic the morphology predicted above , and ",
    "due to the presence of strong absorption bands in the stellar atmosphere  potentially also exhibit blue colours if studied in only a small number of filters .",
    "however , such interlopers can be weeded out by follow - up spectroscopy of the arc ( which is unlikely to display a metal - free emission - line spectrum in this case ) , or by the detection of multiple images of the arc ( since foreground stars are unlikely to be superposed on all of them ) .    in the case where the star cluster itself remains unresolved ( due to low stretching ) and",
    "the extended nebula remains undetected due to low surface brightness , colour criteria would have to be applied directly to the dropout catalog , but unless multiple images of the same object can be detected , it may be difficult to establish if the target is indeed gravitationally lensed .    since extreme magnification sightlines tend to be affected by lensing at several different redshifts ( sect .",
    "[ probabilities ] ) , there is also a non - negligible risk that the strongly lensed image from a pop iii object may be blended with light from foreground lens galaxies , therefore making identification and analysis more difficult .",
    "our recipe for populating halos along the line - of - sight with galaxies from semi - analytical models ( which predict both luminosities and sizes ) in principle allows us to investigate this issue , and we aim to revisit this in future work .",
    "the required stellar population mass of @xmath5 represents a hard limit for the detection of direct star light from @xmath3 pop iii star clusters at magnification @xmath140 in the foreseeable future . as discussed in sect .",
    "[ intro ] , large numbers of pop iii stars can form in atomic cooling halos that manage to remain chemically pristine , a scenario that likely requires a background lyman - werner ( lw ) radiation field that suppresses molecular hydrogen ( @xmath141 ) formation and , consequently , pop iii star formation in minihaloes .",
    "this scenario has been explored predominantly in the context of supermassive star and direct collapse black hole formation in regions of the universe with a lw radiation field high enough above the cosmic mean to entirely suppress @xmath141 formation .",
    "it it thought the onset of efficient @xmath141 cooling is required for star cluster , rather than supermassive star , formation @xcite , requiring a uv background intensity below @xmath142 for @xmath141 to form in sufficient abundance but above @xmath143 to suppress star formation in minihalos ( here , @xmath144 denotes the radiation intensity at the lyman - limit in units of @xmath145 ) . explicitly focusing on pop iii star cluster formation",
    ", @xcite argued that total stellar masses of @xmath146 may be achievable given a low enough lw background intensity , though unaccounted for internal lw feedback may be significant in reducing the star formation efficiency .",
    "the inclusion of ionizing radiation further increases the propensity for pop iii galaxies with total stellar masses @xmath147 @xcite .",
    "related studies @xcite have routinely found central gravitationally unstable clumps with masses in excess of @xmath148 and central accretion rates of 0.01  1 @xmath103 yr@xmath30 to form in chemically pristine , high - redshift atomic cooling haloes .",
    "the results of these studies additionally suggest that fragmentation , if it does occur , happens on small scales ( @xmath14910 pc ) favoring the formation of a compact pop iii stellar cluster .",
    "while the limit of @xmath5 adopted in this work seems marginally achievable for the total stellar mass of a pop iii galaxy , additional cosmological simulations are needed that focus on the possibility and characteristics of a metal - free stellar cluster forming in an atomic cooling halo .      as discussed in sect .",
    "[ probabilities ] , @xmath83 scenarios may be relevant in the case of telescopes like euclid and wfirst , that are projected to survey even larger regions of the sky than wish .",
    "for instance , the wfirst - afta mission concept could survey 1600 deg@xmath4 down to @xmath150 - 26.9 per year at 1.0 - 1.8 @xmath38 m .",
    "the planned wfirst high latitude survey , scheduled to cover 2400 deg@xmath4 , would be able to take advantadge of magnifications up to @xmath151 and detect pop iii star clusters with masses @xmath152 .",
    "more detailed lensing and pop iii star formation simulations would be required to assess the viability of such scenarios , given the star cluster compactness ( @xmath153 pc ; @xcite ) likely required .",
    "moreover , since wfirst is currently considered for launch in 2024 , it is unclear if it will be able to take advantage of jwst for follow - up studies .",
    "we propose that compact ( @xmath2 pc ) high - redshift ( @xmath3 ) population iii star clusters with top - heavy imfs and total stellar mass @xmath5 may be detectable at extreme magnifications ( @xmath17 ) in the planned wish 100 deg@xmath4 ultradeep survey .",
    "improved simulations of star formation in metal - free atomic cooling halos would be very useful to assess the likeliness of such star clusters forming .",
    "we also argue that once candidates for such objects are found , follow - up observations with the jwst and/or groundbased extremely large telescopes should be able to confirm the population iii nature of these objects and potentially confirm that the stellar initial mass function of pop iii stars is top - heavy .",
