    "new neutral gauge bosons @xmath0 are predicted by many models addressing the physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) such as guts @xcite , supersymmetric @xcite , superstring models @xcite and models including a new long - range interaction , i.e. the fifth force , @xcite.the predictions for the mass of the @xmath0 boson are not very firm and it could be light enough ( @xmath4 ) for searches at low energies .",
    "the detailed study of the possible manifestations of light gauge boson was performed in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that if the mass @xmath5 is of the order of the pion mass , an effective search could be performed for this new vector boson in the radiative decays of neutral pseudoscalar mesons @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , or @xmath8 . from the analysis of the data from earlier experiments , constraints on branching ratios for the decay of @xmath6 range from @xmath9 to @xmath10 depending on whether @xmath0 interacts with both quarks and leptons or only with quarks .  in the first case",
    "@xmath0 is a short lived particle decaying mainly to @xmath11 or @xmath12 pairs , while in the second case @xmath0 should be a relatively long lived particle ( @xmath13 ) @xcite .",
    "direct searches for a signal from @xmath14 decay have been performed in a few experiments .",
    "the best experimental limit on the decay @xmath15 was obtained recently by the crystal barrel collaboration at cern using @xmath16 annihilations as a source of pseudoscalar mesons , see @xcite and references there.the branching ratio limit of @xmath17 to @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) has been obtained for @xmath20 mev .",
    "limit of the same order has been obtained for @xmath21 for the higher @xmath5 mass region .",
    "the results are valid for the case where @xmath0 is a long lived particle or the @xmath0 boson decays preferably into @xmath22 pairs .    in this paper",
    "we show that a new light relatively long lived gauge boson which might be produced in decays of @xmath23 could be effectively searched for in neutrino experiments via the primakoff effect , in the process of @xmath24 conversion in the external coulomb field of a nucleus .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the x - boson phenomenology .",
    "section 3 describes the suggested method and presents the results of calculations of the cross section for @xmath25 conversion .",
    "an estimate of the total cross section for the x - boson interaction with the matter is given in section 4 .",
    "in section 5 we consider nomad neutrino detector at cern as example to estimate expected @xmath26 conversion rate in this experiment .",
    "section 6 contains concluding remarks and discussion .",
    "as it has been mentioned in the introduction many modern models predict an enlargement of the standard @xmath27 gauge group by an extra @xmath28 factor . at present",
    "there are no firm theoretical prediction on the mass of new gauge boson so we ca nt exclude the possibility that new gauge boson is rather light with a mass @xmath29 .",
    "the possibility of the existence of a vector boson , which interacts with the baryon current , was suggested by lee and yang @xcite . if this boson is massless , then the results of the experiments on the check of the equivalence principle imply a strong constraint on its coupling constant @xcite @xmath30 .",
    "however this constraint is no longer valid for massive gauge boson with microscopic compton wavelength .",
    "astrophysical bound on the x - boson coupling is @xcite @xmath31 for @xmath32 kev .",
    "the interaction lagrangian of the x - boson with quarks and leptons has the form @xcite @xmath33x^{\\mu } , \\ ] ] where @xmath34 . by c - parity arguments",
    ", one can find that a coupling of x - boson to the axial quark current gives a negligible small contribution to the @xmath35 decay width .",
    "the @xmath36 decay width is determined by the formula @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath5 is the mass of the @xmath0-boson . for the @xmath40 we have",
    "@xcite @xmath41    for the case when @xmath0-boson interacts with both quarks and leptons combined bounds from anomalous magnetic moment of leptons , elastic @xmath42 scattering and beam dump experiments lead @xcite to @xmath43 or to @xmath44 the @xmath0-boson lifetime for @xmath45 and @xmath46 is less than @xmath47 sec .",
    "so , @xmath0-boson is short lived particles and such scenario is not interesting for us .     in this letter",
    "we consider the case where the @xmath0 is a `` leptophobic '' boson which interacts only with quarks .",
    "consider the life time of the @xmath0-boson for such scenario .",
    "experimental limits for the @xmath48 @xcite lead to the bound on coupling of @xmath0 to quarks of @xmath49  for @xmath50 the @xmath0-boson decay width into 3 photons via quark loop is proportional to @xmath51 where @xmath52 is an effective quark mass . using eq.(6 ) we find that @xmath53 sec .",
    "the decay width of the @xmath0-boson into @xmath54 via quark loop is proportional to @xmath55 for @xmath56 mev we find that @xmath57 sec .",
    "for @xmath58 the @xmath0-boson decays mainly into @xmath11 through the quark loop and its decay width for @xmath59 is @xmath60^{2 }   \\alpha_{x } m_{x } ( \\frac{m_{x}}{m_{q , eff}})^4\\ ] ] for @xmath56 mev and @xmath61^{2 } = o(1)$ ] we find that @xmath62 sec .",
    "so , we conclude that for the case when the x - boson interacts only with quarks it is long lived particle at least for @xmath56 mev and for @xmath0 boson energy @xmath63 gev it travels the distance more than 10 km before its decay which is much larger than the typical decay length ( @xmath641 km ) in the current neutrino experiments .",
    "let us consider for simplicity the decay @xmath65 .",
    "the consideration for decay of @xmath66 is similar .",
    "if the decay @xmath65 exists , one expects a flux of high energy @xmath0 bosons from a neutrino target , since @xmath67 are abundantly produced in the forward direction by high energy ( a few hundred gev ) protons in a neutrino target .",
    "if @xmath0 is a long lived particle , this flux would penetrate the downstream shielding without significant attenuation ( see section 4 ) and would be observed in a neutrino detector via the primakoff effect , namely in the conversion process @xmath3 in the external coulomb field of a nucleus ( see figure 1 ) .     because the cross section for @xmath68 conversion is proportional to z@xmath69 , preferable search for such events is in high - z detectors.the experimental signature of @xmath68 conversion is a single high energy @xmath67 decaying into two photons which results in isolated electromagnetic showers in the detector .",
    "the occurrence of @xmath70 conversion would appear as an excess of neutrino - like interactions with pure electromagnetic final states above those expected from sm predictions .",
    "note that @xmath71 conversion could also be identified through charged decay modes of @xmath66 mesons in the final state .",
    "the energy spectrum of @xmath0-bosons at neutrino detector is expected to be harder than that of neutrinos , since there is no suppression of the high energy part due to life time of @xmath72 , as it is in case of charged pions those decays in flight are the main source of neutrino .  thus , one could expect that the highest energy bins have better sensitivity to @xmath3 conversion signal .    the cross section for @xmath68 conversion via the primakoff mechanism is given by the minimal modification of the corresponding formula for the axion photoproduction @xcite .  in the lab system ,",
    "we find    @xmath73    where @xmath74 , @xmath75 is the momentum of the @xmath0-boson , @xmath76 , @xmath77 is the target form factor , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .  since the minimal momentum square in our case @xmath80 , is rather small , atomic form - factors must be used when t is small and a nuclear form factor for @xmath81 @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it should be noted that in comparison with formula ( 18 ) of ref.@xcite which describes the cross section of axion photoproduction ( @xmath82 ) , a factor of @xmath83 arises from photon and x - boson non - identity and the factor @xmath84 in the denominator comes from the kinematics of @xmath85 decay .",
    "the target form - factor @xmath77 consists of three parts .  at small @xmath86 , we use thomas - fermi - moliere model for the atomic form - factors @xcite : @xmath87 @xmath88 @xmath89 where @xmath90 , @xmath91 .   for values of @xmath92",
    ", we use the elastic nuclear form - factor @xcite @xmath93 @xmath94 where @xmath95 and a is the mass number .   for @xmath96- values relevant to our case",
    "the differential cross section @xmath97 can be written in the form @xmath98 where @xmath99 for heavy nuclei . using the atomic and nuclear form - factors ( 2 - 6 ) we find that the total cross section for @xmath100 is given by @xmath101 @xmath102 , \\ ] ] @xmath103,\\ ] ] @xmath104    for heavy nuclei and for @xmath0 boson masses not too close to the @xmath105 mass and for @xmath106 gev , we find that @xmath107 , @xmath108 .",
    "the inelastic atomic form - factor gives a contribution to the total cross section of about 1@xmath109 , which we neglect .",
    "the total cross section then takes the simple form : @xmath110\\ ] ] for pb ( @xmath111 , @xmath112 ) , we find @xmath113mev@xmath114 , @xmath115mev@xmath114 , @xmath116 mev .",
    "note that the total cross section ( 12 ) depends neither on the atomic radius @xmath117 , @xmath118 nor on the value @xmath119 ( the border between the application of atomic and nuclear form - factors ) .",
    "numerically for @xmath120 ev and for @xmath0 boson masses @xmath121 mev , we find that the total cross section of @xmath3 conversion on lead depends rather weakly on the incoming @xmath0 boson momentum as shown in figure 2 .",
    "the approximation ( 12 ) works up to @xmath122 mev .  for @xmath123 close to @xmath124",
    "it is necessary to use formulae ( 8 - 11 ) .",
    "the accuracy of the form - factor calculations is estimated to be better than 5@xmath109 , @xcite ; so the accuracy of our formula ( 12 ) is of the same order of magnitude .    [ figure 19 : ]",
    "the total cross section @xmath125 for @xmath0-interactions in the fe- shielding used in neutrino experiments can be estimated in the following way .",
    "we consider the particular case where the @xmath0 boson interaction with u- and d- quarks is proportional to the electromagnetic interaction , namely : @xmath126\\ ] ] in this case , one can find that the total @xmath0-proton interaction cross section is @xmath127 the @xmath0 boson cross section on the nuclei in the lowest order approximation is proportional to the atomic number in full analogy with the case of neutrino scattering ( here we implicitly suppose that the cross section on protons is equal to the cross section on the neutrons , an approximation valid to within a factor of 2 ) .",
    "@xmath128    numerically for laboratory beam momenta 1 gev@xmath129 gev , @xcite one has : @xmath130 for iron ( a = 56 ) and for @xmath5 much smaller than @xmath124 we find that @xmath131 for @xmath132 , we find @xmath133    this estimate of the total cross section for @xmath0 interaction with matter shows that the assumption that @xmath0 bosons are penetrating particles is correct since for @xmath132 we find that the @xmath0 boson mean free path in iron is @xmath134 300 km , as compared with the fe and earth shielding ( total length @xmath135 0.4 km ) used for example in the cern sps neutrino beam .",
    "in this section we consider the nomad neutrino detector at cern@xcite as an example in order to estimate the rate of @xmath68 conversion in this experiment .",
    "the neutrino beam is generated by 450 gev protons delivered by the sps to the be neutrino target .",
    "the expected number of @xmath26 events can be calculated using the following relations : @xmath136 ^ 2 \\cdot n_{pot } \\cdot \\int f_{0}(m_{x } ) \\sigma_{0}(m_{x},e_{x } ) \\varepsilon_{sel } de_{x } \\cdot   \\frac{m_{t}}{s } \\cdot \\frac{n_{a}}{a}\\ ] ]    where @xmath137 is the predicted number of @xmath26 events for the given @xmath138 , @xmath139 is the detection efficiency , @xmath140 is the flux of @xmath0 bosons per one proton on neutrino target ( pot ) , @xmath141 is the total number of pot s , @xmath142 is the cross section of @xmath68 conversion on target with mass number @xmath143 , calculated for @xmath138=1 , and @xmath144 and @xmath145 are fiducial mass and fiducial area of the detector target , respectively .",
    "we note that @xmath138 appears twice in the formula for @xmath137 , through the @xmath0 boson flux from the target , and through the primakoff mechanism .",
    "the flux of the @xmath0- bosons through nomad detector was calculated with a detailed geant @xcite simulation used to predict the neutrino flux at the nomad detector , and was found to be of the order @xmath146 for @xmath138=1 and with average @xmath0-boson energy @xmath147 .",
    "note that the flux and average energy @xmath148 are weakly depended on mass @xmath5 .",
    "this results in weak dependence of limit on branching ratio versus @xmath5 .",
    "we will consider nomad preshower detector@xcite as a lead target with @xmath1491 ton and @xmath150 .",
    "using @xmath141 = 10@xmath151 pot , @xmath138 = 3@xmath152 10@xmath153 , which corresponds to the crystal barrel upper limit for @xmath154 , @xmath155 and value of the cross section @xmath142 = 4.0 @xmath156b taken for simplicity at @xmath157= 5 gev ( see figure 2 ) one obtains    @xmath158    the main contribution to the background for the @xmath3 conversion is expected from the neutrino processes which have a significant electromagnetic component in the final state , e.g. coherent and diffractive @xmath67 production , quasi - elastic @xmath159 scattering , etc ..  using the neutrino cross sections which are well known , the total number of background events @xmath160 was estimated to be @xmath161 events.thus , if the decay @xmath162 exists with the branching ration of the order of crystal barrel limit its effect would be easy seen at nomad detector .",
    "the limit on @xmath138 could be improved by a factor of the order @xmath163 .",
    "the coupling to quarks could be constrained to @xmath164 .",
    "the similar estimate for @xmath165 conversion rate shows that a limit of the order of the crystal barrel limit on @xmath166 could be obtained , however for a longer exposure time at neutrino beam , since the production of @xmath66 mesons in the forward direction in high energy proton collision with neutrino target is suppressed by a factor of @xmath167 compare to that of @xmath67 s .",
    "we have shown that a new light gauge boson @xmath0 which might be produced in the decays of pseudoscalar mesons @xmath1 could be effectively searched for in neutrino experiments .",
    "the @xmath0 s being produced in neutrino target from these decays would penetrate the downstream shielding , and be observed in a neutrino detector via the primakoff effect , the process of @xmath2 conversion in the external coulomb field of a nucleus .",
    "+ our estimates show , that nomad experiment at cern is able to improve current limit on @xmath168 at least by a factor of 10 for the mass region @xmath169 during @xmath64 1 month of exposure at neutrino beam . note that direct searches of these rare radiative meson decays were performed in the previous experiments @xcite by searching for a peak in inclusive photon spectra from two - body decay of the tagged @xmath72 mesons , where background due to missing of one of the two photon from principal decay mode @xmath170 is dominated for the low @xmath5 mass region .",
    "our method is free from this disadvantage since its sensitivity is weakly depended on @xmath5 .",
    "note also that another promising way to search for a new light gauge boson from the pseudoscalar meson decays in neutrino experiments is to analyse the ratio @xmath171 which might result in better sensitivity .",
    "however , in this case a knowledge of the final state structure in @xmath0 interactions with a quarks is required .",
