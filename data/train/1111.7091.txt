    "deep snow , combined with strong winds and unstable snowpack , contributes to the formation of avalanches , and can cause fatalities and economic loss due to property damage or reduced mobility .",
    "the quantitative analysis of extreme snow events is important for the dimensioning of avalanche defence structures , bridges and buildings , for flood protection measures and for integral risk management .",
    "compared to phenomena such as rain , wind or temperature , extreme - value statistics of snow has been little studied . @xcite and @xcite analyzed three - day snowfall depth in the italian and swiss alps , and more recently @xcite analyzed extreme snowfall in switzerland .",
    "these articles derive characteristics of extreme snow events based on univariate extreme - value modeling which does not account for the dependence across different stations .",
    "the spatial dependence of extreme snow data has yet to be discussed in the literature .",
    "statistical modeling with multivariate extreme value distributions began around two decades ago with publications such as @xcite and @xcite , and has subsequently often been used for quantifying extremal dependence in applications .",
    "financial examples are currency exchange rate data [ @xcite ] , swap rate data [ @xcite ] and stock market returns [ poon , rockinger and tawn ( @xcite ) ] , and environmental examples are rainfall data [ schlather and tawn ( @xcite ) ] , oceanographical data [ @xcite ; @xcite ] and wind speed data [ @xcite ; @xcite ]",
    ". none of these articles treats the process under study as a spatial extension of multivariate extreme value theory .    until recently ,",
    "a key difficulty in studying extreme events of spatial processes has been the lack of flexible models and appropriate inferential tools .",
    "two different approaches to overcome this have been proposed .",
    "the first and most popular is to introduce a latent process , conditional on which standard extreme models are applied [ @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ] .",
    "such models can be fitted using markov chain monte carlo simulation , but they postulate independence of extremes conditional on the latent process , and this is implausible in applications .",
    "one approach to introducing dependence is through a spatial copula , as suggested by @xcite , but although this approach is an improvement , @xcite show that it can nevertheless lead to inadequate modeling of extreme rainfall . a second approach now receiving increasing attention rests on max - stable processes , first suggested by @xcite and developed by , for example , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "recent applications to rainfall data can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , and to temperature data in @xcite .",
    "max - stable modeling has the potential advantage of accounting for spatial dependence of extremes in a way that is consistent with the classical extreme - value theory , but is much less well developed than the use of latent processes or copulas . in the present paper ,",
    "we use data from a denser measurement network than for previous applications .",
    "owing to complex topography and weather patterns , the processes of @xcite and @xcite can not account for the joint distribution of the extremes , and we therefore propose more complex models . we begin with an exploratory analysis highlighting some of the peculiarities of the data , and",
    "then in section [ sec : spat_max ] present the max - stable processes of @xcite and @xcite , which are extended in section [ sec : maxstab_snow ] to our extreme snow depth data . as",
    "full likelihood inference is impossible for such models , in section [ sec : estimation ] we discuss how composite likelihood inference may be used for model estimation and comparison .",
    "the results of the data analysis are presented in section [ sec : appli ] and a concluding discussion is given in section [ sec : discussion ] .     km grid ( left ) and of the stations ( right ) .",

    "are excluded from the analysis for validation . dashed lines in the maps delimit the northern and southern slopes of the alps . ]",
    "we consider annual maximum snow depth from the @xmath0 stations whose locations are shown in figure [ fig : map_swiss ] .",
    "the stations belong to two networks run by the wsl institute for snow and avalanche research ( slf ) and the swiss federal office for meteorology and climatology ( meteoswiss ) .",
    "annual maxima are extracted from daily snow depth measurements , which are read off a measuring stake at around 7.30 am daily from november @xmath2st to april @xmath3th , for the 43 winters 19651966 to 20072008 ; we use the term `` winter @xmath4 '' for the months november @xmath5 to april @xmath4 , and so forth .",
    "examples of such time series can be found in the supplementary materials , @xcite .",
    "as figure [ fig : map_swiss ] shows , the stations are denser in the alpine part of the country , which has high tourist infrastructure and increased population density and traffic during the winter months .",
    "their elevations range from @xmath6 m to @xmath7 m above mean sea level , with only two stations above @xmath8 m. in order to validate our final model , we used @xmath9 stations to choose and fit the model and retained 15 stations for model validation .",
    "let @xmath10 denote the annual maximum snow depth at station @xmath11 of the set @xmath12 , which here denotes switzerland .",
    "data are only available at the stations @xmath13 , so modeling @xmath10 involves inference for the joint distribution of @xmath14 based on observations from @xmath15 , and extrapolation to the whole of @xmath12 .",
    "in particular , as the station elevations lie mainly below @xmath8 m , any results must be extrapolated to elevations higher than @xmath8 m.    daily snow depths at a given location @xmath11 are obviously temporally dependent .",
    "however , time series analysis suggests that , for every location @xmath16 and every winter , daily snow depths show only short - range dependence .",
    "hence , distant maxima of daily snow depths seem to be near - independent and , therefore , the @xmath17 condition for independence of extremes that are well separated in time [ @xcite , section 3.2 ] should be satisfied .",
    "extreme value theory is then expected to apply to annual maximum snow depth : @xmath10 at a location @xmath11 may be expected to follow a generalized extreme - value ( gev ) distribution [ @xcite ] @xmath18,\\ ] ] where @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are , respectively , location , scale and shape parameters .",
    "characterizing the probability distribution of @xmath10 for all @xmath23 is equivalent to characterizing the probability distribution of @xmath24 for any bijective function @xmath25 , which may be easier for a well - chosen @xmath25 .",
    "a first step in our analysis is to transform the data at the stations to the unit frchet scale . whatever the values of the gev parameters @xmath20 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , taking @xmath28 transforms @xmath29 into a spatial process @xmath30 having unit frchet marginal distributions , @xmath31 . as it is easier to deal with @xmath32 in general discussion , we will assume below that the time series at each station has been transformed in this way .",
    "to do so , one might model the gev parameters @xmath20 , @xmath26 and  @xmath22 as smooth functions of covariates indexed by @xmath11 , such as longitude , latitude and elevation [ @xcite ] .",
    "however , due to the very rough topography of switzerland and the influence of meteorological variables such as wind and temperature , snow depth exhibits strong local variation and additional covariates are necessary . a systematic discussion of such covariates and associated smoothing is given by @xcite .",
    "the focus in the present paper is spatial dependence , so rather than adopt their approach , here we simply use gev fits for the individual stations to transform @xmath10 at station @xmath16 into @xmath33 . diagnostic tools such as qq - plots showed a good fit even at low altitudes .",
    "a simple measure of the dependence of spatial maxima at two stations @xmath34 is the extremal coefficient @xmath35 .",
    "if @xmath33 is the limiting process of maxima with unit frchet margins , then [ @xcite , chapter 5 ] @xmath36 one interpretation of @xmath35 appears on noting that @xmath37 if @xmath38 , then the maxima at the two locations are perfectly dependent , whereas if @xmath39 , they are asymptotically independent as @xmath40 , so very rare events appear independently at the two locations .",
    "although they do not fully characterize dependence , such coefficients are useful summaries of the multidimensional extremal distribution .",
    "in particular , it may be informative to compute all extremal coefficients @xmath41 for a given station @xmath11 to see how extremal dependence varies .",
    "figure [ fig : krigmap_extcoeff ] depicts such maps for the snow depth data , for four different reference stations @xmath11 .",
    "extremal coefficients @xmath42 were estimated by the madogram - based estimator of @xcite , and then kriged to the entire area using a linear trend on absolute altitude difference between @xmath11 and  @xmath43 .",
    "similar maps have been proposed for gridded data by @xcite .",
    "much information can be gleaned from figure [ fig : krigmap_extcoeff ] .",
    "a strong elevation effect is clearly visible .",
    "the map for adelboden also suggests a directional effect : for this mid - altitude station in the alps , there is more dependence with other middle - altitude stations in a roughly north - easterly direction .",
    "another striking feature visible in the two lower maps is near - independence between the northern and southern slopes of the alps .",
    "further such maps suggest the presence of the two weakly dependent regions separated by the black dotted line in figure [ fig : map_swiss ] .",
    "a similar north / south separation was seen in @xcite , for good reason : extreme snowfall events occurring in these two regions typically do not stem from the same precipitation systems . whereas extreme snowfall events on the northern slope of the alps usually arise from northerly or westerly airflows [ @xcite ] ,",
    "those in the southern slope usually come from the south or south - west . these are less frequent , but when they occur they can be very severe , due to the proximity of the mediterranean sea .",
    "as snow cover results from the accumulation of many snowfall events during the winter , one can expect annual maximum snow depths on the northern and southern slopes of the alps to be somewhat disconnected .",
    "the winter of @xmath44 illustrates this : little snow fell on the southern slope of the alps , while the northern slope received large amounts .",
    "figure [ fig : krigmap_extcoeff ] nevertheless suggests that these two regions are asymptotically weakly dependent , since @xmath35 is generally larger than @xmath45 , but not necessarily asymptotically independent . even between well - separated stations ,",
    "@xmath35 is rarely very close to 2 , perhaps owing to the rather small area under study , in which the largest distance between stations is around @xmath46 km .",
    "the spatial dependence highlighted in section  [ sec : spatial_dpce ] suggests that we model @xmath33 as a spatial process of extremes .",
    "a max - stable process with unit frchet margins is a stochastic process @xmath30 with the property that , if @xmath47 are @xmath48 independent copies of the process , then [ @xcite ] @xmath49 a consequence of this definition is that all finite - dimensional marginal distributions are max - stable : if @xmath50 is a finite subset of @xmath12 , then for all @xmath51 , @xmath52 such processes have several representations , two of which we now sketch .",
    "a general method of constructing max - stable processes is due to @xcite .",

    "@xcite gives a rainfall - storms interpretation of this construction .",
    "he suggests regarding @xmath56 as a space of storm centers , of @xmath62 as the shape of a storm centered at @xmath63 , and of @xmath64 as a  storm magnitude .",
    "then @xmath65 represents the amount of rainfall received at location @xmath11 for a storm of magnitude @xmath64 centered at @xmath63 and @xmath33 in ( [ eq : constr_dehaan ] ) is the maximum rainfall received at @xmath11 over an infinite number of independent storms .",

    "if , like most geostatistical correlation functions , the underlying gaussian process has @xmath115 when @xmath116 , then the limiting case @xmath117 corresponds to @xmath118 , and so independent extremes do not arise even at very large distances .",
    "moreover , as an isotropic correlation function can give correlations no smaller than @xmath119 in @xmath120 and @xmath121 in @xmath122 [ @xcite , page 16 ] , under schlather s model we have @xmath123 for any @xmath69 , @xmath70 in @xmath120 and @xmath124 for any @xmath69 , @xmath70 in @xmath122 .",
    "thus , it is impossible to produce independent extremes using such a process , no matter how distant the stations .",
    "@xcite have proposed extensions to allow independence in ( [ eq : biv_schlather ] ) , and @xcite have extended both smith s and schlather s representations .",
    "as pointed out in section [ sec : spatial_dpce ] , snow depth data show two key characteristics that should be explicitly modeled in the max - stable process .",
    "first , dependence is anisotropic , due to the strong elevation effect and the presence of a main direction of dependence .",
    "second , switzerland seems to be divided into two weakly dependent climatic regions : the northern slope of the alps together with the plateau , which is the low altitude region north of the swiss alps ; and the southern slope of the alps . in this section",
    "we propose to extend the smith and schlather models of sections [ sec : smith_model][sec : schlather_model ] to account for these features .",
    "other representations described in @xcite , in @xcite or in @xcite are not considered in this paper .",
    "smith s model can directly model anisotropy using a nonspherical @xmath125 matrix in ( [ eq : biv_smith ] ) .",
    "the simple version of schlather s model is isotropic , but it can easily account for anisotropy by considering a  transformed space @xmath126 instead of @xmath12 .",
    "anisotropy of smith s model arises from the fact that the distance used in the extremal coefficient ( [ eq : extcoeff_smith ] ) is mahalanobis distance ( [ eq : mahaldist ] ) rather than euclidean distance . using the eigendecomposition @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is a  rotation matrix and",
    "@xmath129 a diagonal matrix of positive eigenvalues , we may write @xmath130 where @xmath131 denotes the diagonal matrix composed of the reciprocal square roots of the diagonal elements of @xmath129 .",
    "if @xmath132 denotes the first element of @xmath129 , then ( [ eq : isigma ] ) can be written as @xmath133 , where @xmath134 .",
    "the squared mahalanobis distance ( [ eq : mahaldist ] ) is @xmath135^t [ v ( x_1-x_2 ) ] , \\ ] ] which is exactly that between @xmath136 and @xmath137 in the isotropic case , that is ,  when using a @xmath81-dimensional spherical covariance matrix @xmath138 in ( [ eq : biv_smith ] ) .",
    "thus , the anisotropic smith model on @xmath12 is just the isotropic smith model on the transformed space @xmath139 .",
    "similar ideas can be used with schlather s model , by applying it on @xmath139 , where in three dimensions we may take @xmath140 as for smith s model . in the rest of the paper",
    "we will use the term climate space for  the transformed space @xmath139 in which isotropy is achieved .",
    "figure [ fig : geogr_clim_space ] illustrates the climate space transformation , allowing an anisotropic schlather model , with the same @xmath141 matrix as that corresponding to the anisotropic case of figure  [ fig : simu_smith ] .",
    "compared to figure [ fig : simu_schlather ] , constant extremal coefficients correspond to ellipses , allowing us to model directional effects .",
    "geometric anisotropy as induced by the @xmath141 matrix is a special case of  range anisotropy [ @xcite ] . in the nonextremal framework",
    ", this idea has been extended to nongeometric range anisotropic models , in which nested covariances are used with different range parameters in different directions , but in general this does not define a valid covariance function .",
    "@xcite introduced product geometric anisotropy , under which covariance functions are products of geometric anisotropic covariances .",
    "space transformation has also been used by @xcite to model nonstationary spatial covariance structures , allowing more complex transformations than the affine transformation considered here .",
    "in addition to these global methods , local methods for modeling anisotropy and more general forms of nonstationarity also exist .",
    "these can be divided in three main families [ @xcite ] .",
    "the moving window approach of @xcite estimates a covariance function locally within a neighborhood .",
    "the convolution method of @xcite allows the construction of weakly nonstationary processes by convolving a zero - mean white noise process with a kernel function whose parameters can depend on location .",
    "the method of weighted stationary processes [ @xcite ] allows one to write the nonstationary covariance function as a weighted mixture of isotropic covariances , where the weights depend on the location .",
    "@xcite use a dirichlet process mixture as the basis for a  flexible copula approach to space - time modeling of extreme temperatures , but it does not correspond to a max - stable process model , and the relatively long - range dependence of temperatures can be modeled more simply than can precipitation phenomena such as rain- and snowfall .",
    "it would be very valuable to apply these ideas in the max - stable context , but the unavailability of a likelihood function seems to be a major obstacle .",
    "the idea of space transformation was used by @xcite in modeling us precipitation . instead of using the three - dimensional geographical coordinates ( longitude , latitude , elevation ) for locating stations , the authors work in a `` climate space , '' namely , the two - dimensional space given by elevation and mean precipitation for the months april to october .",
    "unlike in @xcite , our transformation is affine , giving more weight to elevation through @xmath142 , and defining a main direction of dependence along the @xmath143-axis . a higher - dimensional space could of course be used for @xmath12 . in particular , one could use the four - dimensional space of ( longitude , latitude , elevation , mean snow depth ) , thus blending the @xcite approach with ours ; see section [ sec : appli ] .",
    "different approaches to accounting for the impact of the climate regions on the extremes are possible :    1 .",
    "_ the climate regions are independent . _",
    "this is equivalent to saying that two max - stable processes govern the two regions independently . in terms of spatial dependence",
    ", extremal coefficient maps will be of the form of figure  [ fig : simu_smith ] or [ fig : geogr_clim_space ] but replacing the swiss border by the border of the northern region alone for the pairwise dependence with a station located in the north , and similarly for the southern region .",
    "the climate regions are weakly dependent . _",
    "since dependence between pair of stations decreases when distance increases , one way to model weakly dependent regions is to increase the distance between them .",
    "this can be done by adding to @xmath12 a coordinate equal to @xmath144 in the northern region , and to @xmath2 in the southern region .",
    "if the other coordinates are ( longitude , latitude , elevation ) , then the @xmath141 matrix of the climate space transformation ( [ eq : v_3d ] ) can be written in the most general case as a @xmath145 matrix with one column comprising @xmath144 apart from one element . nevertheless , for computational reasons it may be better to consider the rotation matrix @xmath128 of section [ sec : anisotrop ] as being a rotation matrix in the ( longitude , latitude ) plane and thus to set @xmath146 we shall do this in section [ sec : appli ] . in the four - dimensional climate space @xmath147 ,",
    "the squared distance between two stations @xmath69 and @xmath70 is @xmath148 .",
    "but the fourth coordinate of @xmath149 is @xmath144 if the two stations belong to the same region and @xmath150 otherwise .",
    "the squared distance will then equal that in the ( longitude , latitude , elevation ) climate space if the two stations are in the same region , and be increased by @xmath151 otherwise .",
    "we thus increase the distance between the climate regions , and therefore decrease the dependence between them , without increasing the distance between stations of the same region . to see how the extremal coefficients behave , see the left - hand side of figure [ fig : extrcoeff_climreg ] .",
    "the climate regions are weakly dependent in continuous space .",
    "_ since the additional coordinate introduced above jumps from @xmath144 to @xmath2 at the border between the regions , it induces a discontinuity of the extremal coefficients which is visible in the left map of figure [ fig : extrcoeff_climreg ] ; see the cyan and magenta ellipses .",
    "this seems unrealistic and something smoother is preferable .",
    "an easy way to impose space continuity is to take the border to be a  band inside which the fourth coordinate is linearly interpolated between @xmath144 and  @xmath2 , with value @xmath144 on the upper - border of the band and @xmath2 on the lower - border . with this simple interpolation",
    ", there is no jump at the border and curves of constant extremal coefficient are continuous , as in the right - hand side of figure [ fig : extrcoeff_climreg ] .",

    "statistical inference for parametric models is ideally performed using the likelihood function .",
    "let @xmath152 denote the @xmath9 stations whose maxima are used for fitting the models .",

    "the use of the pairwise likelihood estimator for smith s process was validated by @xcite in a simulation study .      estimating the maximum pairwise likelihood estimator requires the maximization of ( [ eq : pair_lik ] ) with respect to the @xmath172  parameters .",

    "2 .   for @xmath178 in @xmath179 : a.   find the value @xmath180 that maximizes the pairwise likelihood with respect to the scalar @xmath175 , holding the other parameters , @xmath174 , fixed , that is,@xmath181 b.   then update the @xmath178th component of @xmath168 to @xmath182 .",
    "3 .   go to step 2 , stopping when no change to any @xmath175 can increase the pairwise log - likelihood .        to assess the performance of this algorithm , we simulated 200 data sets , each comprising @xmath183 independent copies of schlather s max - stable random field ( [ eq : biv_schlather ] ) with cauchy covariance function @xmath103 in a three - dimensional climate space .",
    "each of the copies is observed at the same @xmath184 stations , so the number of observations is very similar to those for the annual snow depth data ; see section [ sec : data ] .",
    "the climate transformation is defined through a @xmath185 matrix @xmath141 as in ( [ eq : v_3d ] ) .",
    "the model has three parameters for the @xmath141 matrix and two for the covariance function , which induces middling dependence : about 25% of the pairs of stations have extremal coefficients @xmath186 ; recall from section [ sec : schlather_model ] that for schlather s model , @xmath187 .",
    "we started from the same initial point for each of the @xmath188 data sets and optimized the log pairwise likelihood ( [ eq : pair_lik ] ) with ( i ) eight optimization procedures within the ` r ` function ` optim ` with all parameters estimated jointly [ @xcite ] ; and ( ii ) the above profile likelihood algorithm .",
    "figure [ fig : compar_estim_meth ] shows the differences between the pairwise log - likelihoods for the methods at convergence , for the 200 data sets .",
    "the profiling method never gives lower maximized pairwise likelihoods than the other algorithms , and they are almost always higher .",
    "further simulations with small- and large - range dependence gave similar results [ @xcite ] : overall profiling is clearly better than the other algorithms .",
    "those that compare best with profiling , viz . , nelder  mead and simulated annealing , are designed for rather rough surfaces with many local optima .",
    "these simulated data are relatively simple compared to the real data , which are neither exactly unit frchet after transformation from ( [ eq : transf_frechet ] ) nor follow a pure max - stable process .",
    "furthermore , the max - stable model used for the simulation is quite simple , with only five parameters to be estimated , so the profiling approach seems necessary for our , more complex , application .",
    "model selection criteria play an important role in deciding which of the fitted models should be preferred . as in @xcite",
    ", we propose to use the composite likelihood information criterion [ @xcite ] , which extends the @xmath189 [ @xcite ] to the composite likelihood setting , and is defined as @xmath190 where @xmath191 and @xmath192 are , respectively , the observed information matrix and the squared score statistic corresponding to @xmath171 , defined at equations ( [ eq : j_matrix ] ) and  ( [ eq : k_matrix ] ) , and @xmath193 is the maximum pairwise likelihood estimator .",
    "lower values of @xmath194 correspond to better quality models .",
    "we fitted the different models described in section [ sec : maxstab_snow ] to our snow depth data , using both smith and schlather max - stable structures for the extremes .",
    "for schlather s model , different choices of gaussian covariance function @xmath103 lead to different distributions ( [ eq : biv_schlather ] ) .",
    "we used nine such functions , namely , the spherical , circular , cubic , gneiting , exponential , matrn , gaussian , powered - exponential and cauchy covariance functions [ @xcite ; @xcite ] .",
    "each has either one or two parameters and the first four have an upper bound .",
    "they all are such that @xmath195 when @xmath196 and @xmath197 when @xmath116 . as mentioned in section [ sec : schlather_model ] , this constrains the extremal coefficient for schlather s model to correspond to dependent data .",
    "nevertheless , we will see that such an assumption seems justified in our case .",
    "the coordinates @xmath11 we considered are geographical coordinates ( longitude , latitude , elevation ) , region number ( see section [ sec : model_region ] ) and mean snow depth during the winters 19662008 .",
    "mean precipitation was considered as a possible climate coordinate in @xcite s study of extreme precipitation .",
    "the idea of using mean snow depth is that stations with similar snow depth are probably influenced by the same weather patterns and should therefore be closer in the climate space than are stations with different snow cover .",
    "other climate variables that could be considered are temperature , wind direction and wind speed , which are also measured at the stations , but these values are of relatively poor quality with many missing values , so we decided not to use them .",
    "in addition to the models illustrated in section [ sec : maxstab_snow ] , we allowed the possibility of having different climate spaces in northern and southern regions , that is ,  to have different climate space transformation matrices @xmath141 . in three dimensions , for example , two @xmath141 matrices as in ( [ eq : v_3d ] ) will have to be estimated , with a total of 6 parameters . in the continuous - space case illustrated in figure [ fig : extrcoeff_climreg ] , all coefficients @xmath143 and @xmath198 are linearly interpolated around the north / south border .",
    "we also considered different mixtures of the above possible coordinates . in all cases , we used longitude and latitude , plus possibly the elevation , region number and mean snow depth , or combinations of these three coordinates . in total ,",
    "@xmath199 types of models were considered , each of them being estimated for one smith and nine schlather processes , giving @xmath200 fits in all .",
    "a description of the 65 model types is given in the supplementary materials [ @xcite ] .",
    "all were estimated using the iterative profiling algorithm of section [ sec : estim_practice ] .",
    "values for all @xmath201 fitted schlather models . ]      a summary of the @xmath194 values for the 585 fitted schlather models , rescaled by division by @xmath202 in order to give log - likelihood values that would correspond to independent data , is shown in figure [ fig : tic ] .",
    "there are relatively small differences among them , though the gneiting and gaussian covariance functions seem to perform less well and the spherical and circular covariance functions have the @xmath203 best @xmath194 values .",
    "these covariance functions have an upper bound and are governed by only one parameter .",
    "schlather s model always performs better than smith s model , whatever the chosen covariance function : the rescaled @xmath194 with smith s model is between 30 and 300 units higher than with schlather s model , with a minimum value of 15,650 attained for model 47 . whether with smith or schlather models , the same patterns appear . in particular , the first eight models , which perform poorly , correspond to models in euclidean space , without climate space transformation .",
    "the benefit of working in a transformed space in order to allow for anisotropy is thus clear .",
    "this effect is particularly striking for smith s model , for which it is equivalent to saying that a nonspherical @xmath67 matrix ( see section [ sec : smith_model ] ) should be used : there is a difference of 300 between the lowest rescaled @xmath194 values in the euclidean and climate spaces .",
    "the models numbered @xmath204 , @xmath205 , @xmath206 , @xmath207 , @xmath203 , @xmath208 , @xmath3 , @xmath209 , @xmath210 , @xmath211 , @xmath212 , @xmath213 , @xmath214 , @xmath215 and @xmath216 , which are also poor , correspond to cases when neither elevation nor the mean snow depth are considered [ @xcite ] . as the mean snow depth is strongly related to elevation , the latter is a very important climate coordinate .",
    "it seems to be more informative than the mean snow depth ; models using elevation but not mean snow depth as a coordinate always have lower @xmath194 values than in the converse case .",

    "this means that two @xmath141 matrices are estimated , each of the form ( [ eq : v_4d ] ) but in five dimensions , and thus having five parameters : the main direction of dependence , and the four parameters @xmath198 associated to the latitude , elevation , region number and mean snow depth . since the region number is a binary variable , the @xmath198 value for the northern region can be fixed equal to zero .",
    "the range parameter of the spherical covariance function and the width of the band between the regions are also estimated , for a total of @xmath205 parameters , whose estimates and standard errors are shown in table [ tab : param ] . as the pairwise likelihood is not differentiable with respect to the band width , no standard error is given for it .",
    "the second- and third - best fits are also obtained with spherical covariance functions with similar models as in table [ tab : param ] but without the mean coordinate ( model number  49 , with @xmath229 ) or the region number coordinate ( model number 46 , with @xmath230 ) , that is ,  using a four - dimensional space  @xmath12 . in the latter case , values of the estimated coefficients are such that the northern and southern regions are disjoint in the climate space , although no region number coordinate is used to separate them .",
    "these two models perform similarly because the mean coordinate should provide information about the local variability of snow depth , part of which agrees with the regional division between the northern and southern slopes ; thus , the mean coordinate and region number carry similar information . according to figure [ fig : tic ]",
    ", it seems better to use both coordinates , but using one of them increases the @xmath194 only very slightly .",
    "it is no surprise that in table [ tab : param ] , elevation is the most influential coordinate in the climate distance , and thus in the dependence function . in the north , for example , dependence between two stations at the same elevation but @xmath204 km apart along the main direction of dependence , an angle of @xmath231 radians in the sense of an argand diagram , at the same elevation but @xmath232 km apart perpendicularly to the main direction of dependence , and at the same latitude and longitude but @xmath210 m apart in elevation , are all equal .",
    "an interesting feature is the main direction of dependence in the northern region , which can be explained by two facts :    1 .   due to the strong elevation effect ,",
    "the north slope of the alps ( the mountainous part of the northern region ) is very weakly dependent on the plateau ( the low - elevation part of the northern region ) . but both subregions are oriented along the north alpine ridge , and dependence is thus higher in this direction ; 2 .",
    "this direction is also broadly that of the two widest valleys in switzerland , the rhone and rhine valleys , as shown by the main green valleys in  figure  [ fig : map_swiss ] .",
    "these are wide enough to direct snow - bearing clouds along them , thus inducing strong directional dependence of precipitation .",
    "the high value associated to the region number coordinate gives the lowest possible dependence , @xmath233 , between extremes in the northern and southern regions .",
    "figure [ fig : map_theta_bestmod ] shows maps of the estimated pairwise dependence under the max - stable model of table [ tab : param ] , obtained by extrapolating the mean snow depth at ungauged stations where no data are available . to do this",
    ", we performed spatial kriging with a spline dependence on elevation , to allow for the fact that temperatures at stations below @xmath234 m may exceed @xmath235c even when it is snowing at higher altitudes , leading them to suffer rain rather than snow .",
    "the resulting smooth mean process was successfully validated on the additional @xmath1 stations [ @xcite ] .",
    "figure [ fig : map_theta_bestmod ] clearly shows both the elevation effect and the weak north / south dependence .",
    "the low bandwidth , of about @xmath236 km , induces an abrupt change of the extremal coefficient around the north / south border .",
    "for a first check on the quality of the selected model , we compare its predicted extremal coefficients , obtained by replacing the parameters involved in ( [ eq : extcoeff_schlather ] ) by their estimates from table [ tab : param ] , with the naive estimators of @xcite or the madogram - based estimator of @xcite .",
    "as the extremal coefficients  ( [ eq : extcoeff_schlather ] ) are functions of distance between stations , we plot naive and predicted extremal coefficients against distance .",
    "figure [ fig : comp_extrcoeff_bestmod ] shows such comparisons for our selected model and for the best smith model . for clarity , we only show the madogram - based estimator of @xcite , with and without binning .",
    "the naive estimators of @xcite give essentially the same picture , but with slightly higher variability .",
    "figure [ fig : comp_extrcoeff_bestmod ] shows that the smith model fits the data less well than the schlather model . in particular , the extremal coefficient curve of the smith model crosses the point cloud for the binned madogram , whereas our selected model follows it quite well up to a climate distance of @xmath237 , and then underestimates it .",
    "a limit of about @xmath238 would be expected from the madogram , but can not be attained with schlather s model ; see section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "another way to check our model is to compare the empirical distribution of maxima of subsets of stations , that is ,  @xmath239 , with maxima predicted by the selected model .",
    "the distribution of @xmath240 under the selected model is known analytically only when @xmath241 comprises two stations , but samples of @xmath240 can be simulated for any @xmath242 . since realizations @xmath243 of @xmath240 are available for @xmath159 years , one can compare the empirical quantiles of @xmath240 with the simulated ones .",
    "more precisely , given a subset @xmath241 , we simulate  @xmath244 independent series @xmath245 of length @xmath246 , and thus obtain @xmath244 replicates of the observed frchet series @xmath243 .",
    "ordered values of observed @xmath243 can then be compared with ordered values of the @xmath247 as a graphical test of fit .",
    "pointwise and overall confidence bands can also be derived from these simulations [ @xcite , section 4.2.4 ] .",
    "figure [ fig : comp_groupstat_bestmod ] uses this approach to compare fitted and empirical distributions for different groups of three or four stations taken from the 15 not used to fit the model , some groups being tightly clustered , and others being dispersed .",
    "the fit seems to be broadly satisfactory in all cases .",
    "even the dependence between stations whose climate distance is larger than @xmath248 units seems to be well - modeled , despite the mismatch between the fitted and empirical pairwise extremal coefficients at such distances seen in figure [ fig : comp_extrcoeff_bestmod ] .     simulations . ]      for risk management it is important to be able to assess how extreme events are likely to occur in the same year in different places . a first answer to this question can be obtained by computing probabilities of the form @xmath249 $ ] for a group of stations @xmath241 and different high levels @xmath250 .",
    "figure [ fig : risk_groupstat_bestmod ] plots such probabilities for different groups  @xmath241 when @xmath250 is the @xmath178-year return level of the unit frchet distribution .",
    "by back - transformation from equation ( [ eq : transf_frechet ] ) , this is equivalent to computing the joint survival distributions @xmath251 $ ] where @xmath252 denotes the @xmath178-year return level at station @xmath11 , that is ,  the probability that all stations in  @xmath241 receive more snow a given year than their @xmath178-year return level . under independence , this probability equals @xmath253 for any possible set @xmath241 , where @xmath254 is the number of stations in @xmath241 , whereas it equals @xmath255 under full dependence .",
    "figure [ fig : risk_groupstat_bestmod ] shows very good agreement between the observed and predicted distributions using the model , whereas the risk is underestimated under the hypothesis of independent stations and overestimated under the hypothesis of full dependence .",
    "the underestimation is more striking for quite dependent stations , such as those in the left - hand panel of figure [ fig : risk_groupstat_bestmod ] . when distance increases , the difference between the dependent and independent cases is less striking but our max - stable model fits better even for pairs of stations that are @xmath256 climate distance units apart ; this is almost the largest climate distance between pairs of stations .",
    "the right - hand panel corresponds to a  group of seven stations in the eastern plateau .",
    "our model clearly gives more realistic risk probabilities than does the independence assumption .",
    "extreme snow events in the low - elevation plateau generally occur over a large region due to the easy weather circulation .",
    "a typical example is the extraordinary snowfall event that occurred on march 5th 2006 over the entire plateau , with snow measurements of @xmath257 cm at zurich , @xmath258 cm at basel and @xmath259 cm at sankt gallen .",
    "this was the largest snow depth recorded since 1931 [ @xcite ] .",
    "stations indicated in green were not used for fitting . ]",
    "the models discussed here are a step toward modeling spatial dependence of extreme snow depth .",
    "they are based on the @xcite and @xcite max - stable representations , designed to model extreme snow depth explicitly . in particular , they can account in a flexible way for the presence of weakly dependent regions .",
    "they involve a climate transformation that enables the modeling of directional effects resulting from phenomena such as weather system movements . in the proposed methodology ,",
    "model fitting is performed by using a profile - like method for maximizing the pairwise likelihood function , and model selection is performed using an information criterion .",
    "we applied this methodology to @xmath9 stations with recorded snow depth maxima .",
    "performance of the selected model at small and large scales was assessed on these stations , together with @xmath1 other stations , by comparing empirical and predicted distributions of group of stations . by accounting for spatial dependence ,",
    "our model gives clearly more realistic probabilities of extreme co - occurrence than would a nonspatial model .",
    "such quantities are important for adequate risk management .    considered as a whole ,",
    "the max - stable models proposed in this paper constitute a family of flexible models that could potentially be applied to other kinds of climate data , in particular , extreme precipitation and temperature .",
    "further improvements could nevertheless be investigated , as discussed below .    in this paper",
    "we focus on modeling the spatial dependence of extremes , rather than on the marginal distributions .",
    "a first step was thus to transform maxima from their original scale to a common unit frchet distribution . in the application to snow depth data ,",
    "this transformation was done by using the gev distributions fitted to the time series , considered separately .",
    "a fuller spatial model would consider the three gev marginal parameters as response surfaces .",
    "using the models presented in this paper , one could then simultaneously estimate the spatial dependence and the spatial intensity of maxima , following @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these authors use simple functions of longitude , latitude and elevation , but the very complex alpine topography results in an extremely variable pattern of snow , and we were unable to find satisfactory marginal response surfaces for our application . @xcite describe other approaches that appear to be more satisfactory , but modeling of the margins requires more investigation .",
    "time could be used as a covariate in order to allow for the potential impact of climate change on extreme snow events ; for example , the retreat of the glaciers is strongly affecting microclimates at high altitudes .",
    "this notwithstanding , exploratory work suggests that although climate change has affected mean snow levels [ @xcite ] , its effect on extreme snow events is not yet discernible , except possibly at low elevation [ @xcite ] .    a second improvement might be the consideration of event times , which could be incorporated into the pairwise maximum likelihood procedure [ stephenson and tawn , ( @xcite ) ] . for our data ,",
    "the co - occurrence of annual maxima is quite variable . for winters such as those of 1975 and 2006 ,",
    "snow depth reached its maximum almost simultaneously all over switzerland .",
    "for winters such as those of 1980 , 2007 and 2008 , the annual maxima occurred at quite different dates ; see the supplementary materials , @xcite . including this information by modifying",
    "the pairwise likelihood contribution of maxima occurring simultaneously at two stations might yield more precise inferences , as shown in @xcite .",
    "last but not least , this article has used only snow data gathered from measurements in flat , open and not too exposed fields .",
    "extrapolation to steep , windy and forest terrains may thus be unsatisfactory .",
    "in particular , preferential deposition of snow [ @xcite ] may imply that snow depth on slopes is more extreme than on representative flat fields .",
    "this could have important implications for avalanche risk [ @xcite ] but could not be considered here due to lack of data .",
    "this could be investigated using data from automatic stations located at higher elevations , mostly above 2,200 m , and in various terrains , though such data are unfortunately available only for about ten years .",
    "a spatial model for exceedances over high thresholds [ @xcite ] would be a valuable addition to the extreme - value toolkit for dealing with spatially - dependent short time series .",
    "we thank two referees , an associate editor , the editor and the other project participants , particularly michael lehning , christoph marty , simone padoan and mathieu ribatet , for helpful comments .",
