    "observations ( e.g. ferrarese & merritt 2000 , gebhardt et al . 2000 ) and theoretical arguments ( e.g. silk 1998 , king 2005 ) suggest that the growth of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) at the centres of galaxies are intimately related to the formation of their hosts . however , the details of the interplay between these two components are still not well understood .",
    "the environment of agn , i.e. the mass of the typical dark matter halo ( dmh ) in which they live , is a powerful diagnostic of the physics that drive the formation of smbhs and their hosts .",
    "different models for the co - evolution of agn and galaxies make specific testable predictions on how the environment of active smbhs depends on redshift and accretion luminosity ( e.g. marulli et al .",
    "2006 , hopkins et al .",
    "2007 , fanidakis 2010 , degraf et al .",
    "2010 , bonoli et al .",
    "moreover , there has been progress recently in phenomenological methods to associate baryons to dmhs at different redshifts , to infer in a least model dependent way how galaxies evolve at different environments ( e.g. zheng et al .",
    "2007 , conroy & wechsler 2009 , zehavi et al .",
    "2011 , avila - reese & firmani 2011 ) . by determining",
    "the typical dmh of agn one can place them in the context of those studies to explore the conditions under which smbh grow at different epochs .",
    "an advantage of studying the environment of agn is that it provides one of the few diagnostics of the agn / galaxy interplay that is immune to contamination of the stellar light of galaxies by emission from the central engine .",
    "agn can easily outshine their hosts , thereby rendering studies of the stellar mass , star - formation history and morphology of their hosts challenging and prone to systematics .",
    "this poses a serious limitation in the comparison between observations and models for the growth of smbhs and highlights the importance of clustering studies .",
    "powerful uv bright qsos are one of the few agn classes for which tight constraints on their large scale distribution are available .",
    "this is because of the apparent brightness of these sources in the optical which has allowed large spectroscopic follow - up programs , such as the 2qz ( 2df qso redshift survey , croom et al .",
    "2004 ) , sdss ( sloan digital sky survey , richards et al .",
    "2002 , schneider et al . 2005 ) and 2slaq ( 2df - sdss lrg and qso survey , cannon et al .",
    "2006 , croom et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the picture emerging from those studies is that powerful uv bright qsos live in dark matter haloes of few times @xmath10 almost independent of redshift and accretion luminosity ( e.g. croom et al . 2005 , myers et al .",
    "2007 , da @xmath11ngela et al .",
    "2008 , ross et al .",
    "2009 , ivashchenko et al .",
    "2010 , but see mountichas et al .",
    "these properties are broadly consistent with the predictions of the merger model for the growth of smbh ( e.g. hopkins et al .",
    "2007 , bonoli et al .",
    "2009 ) , suggesting that powerful qsos are the product of interactions between gas rich galaxies .",
    "the qsos selected in the above surveys however , represent luminous and rare sources above the knee of the agn luminosity function .",
    "therefore , they are not representative of the overall agn population and their contribution to the accretion power of the universe is small .",
    "additionally , their selection at uv / optical wavelengths raises concerns on possible biases against obscured sources .",
    "observations at x - ray wavelengths provide an efficient way of selecting agn over a wide luminosity baseline nearly independent of obscuration .",
    "study of the clustering of x - ray agn can therefore constrain the fueling mechanism of the sources that dominate the accretion history of the universe . despite considerable progress in the last few years",
    "however , the large scale distribution of x - ray agn is still not well constrained .",
    "this is primarily because of the apparent faintness of these sources at optical wavelengths and their relatively high surface density on the sky , which make large spectroscopic follow - up programs , similar to those carried out for uv bright qsos , extremely expensive in telescope time .    in the absence of any follow - up observations ,",
    "the most widely used approach for studying the clustering of x - ray agn is the angular auto - correlation function ( e.g. basilakos et al .",
    "2004 , 2005 , plionis et al .",
    "2008 , ebrero et al .",
    "the main limitation of this approach is that assumptions have to be made on the redshift distribution of the agn population to infer the mass of their dark matter haloes .",
    "this introduces systematics and model dependent biases which can be large .",
    "this problem has been mitigated by extensive follow - up spectroscopic programs in selected few x - ray survey fields ( e.g. barger et al .",
    "2003 , brusa et al . 2009 ) , which allowed estimation of the real - space auto - correlation function of x - ray agn samples ( e.g. mullis et al .",
    "2004 , gilli et al .",
    "2005 , 2009 , yang et al .",
    "2006 , allevato et al .",
    "one of the results from these studies is the importance of sample variance .",
    "spikes in the redshift distribution of x - ray sources can significantly affect clustering studies in current x - ray surveys , which typically have small angular sizes ( e.g. gilli et al . 2005 , 2009 ) .",
    "an alternative approach for studying the large scale distribution of agn is the real - space cross - correlation function with galaxies over the same cosmological volume ( e.g. coil et al .",
    "2009 , krumpe et al .",
    "this approach has certain merits compared to auto - correlation function methods , as long as the clustering of the galaxy population is known to a good level of accuracy and spectroscopy is available for the agn .",
    "firstly , the space density of galaxies is typically much larger than that of agn , thereby suppressing random errors when counting agn / galaxy pairs .",
    "secondly , by cross - correlating agn with galaxies in the same field the impact of sample variance is minimised .",
    "the studies above suggest that x - ray agn live in dark matter haloes with masses @xmath12 , which are , on average , more massive than those of uv bright qsos",
    ". the wide range in the estimated dmh masses could be the result of random errors and systematics that affect individual measurements or because the agn clustering may depend on the accretion luminosity , the redshift and/or the level of obscuration of the central engine ( e.g. plionis 2008 , hickox et al .",
    "2011 , allevato et al .",
    "2011 ) .    in this paper",
    "we explore changes in the large scale distribution of moderate luminosity ( @xmath13 ) x - ray selected agn from @xmath8 to @xmath1 .",
    "we use a serendipitous xmm survey of the sdss area ( xmm / sdds , georgakakis & nandra 2011 ) to compile a sample of low redshift agn , @xmath1 .",
    "these sources are then cross - correlated with the sdss main galaxy sample ( strauss et al .",
    "2002 ) to infer their clustering properties .",
    "the advantage of the serendipitous xmm / sdss survey is that the agn selection function at low redshift is almost identical to that of x - ray agn at @xmath8 detected in deep chandra and xmm surveys .",
    "therefore differential selection effects between low and high redshift samples are minimal .",
    "this allows direct comparison of the environment of moderate luminosity x - ray agn across redshift to investigate possible evolutionary trends . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "rest frame quantities ( e.g. luminosities , dark matter halo masses ) are parametrised by @xmath17 .",
    "the clustering properties of x - ray agn at @xmath1 are investigated by selecting low redshift sources detected in a serendipitous xmm survey of the sdss footprint ( xmm / sdss ) . the construction of the xmm / sdss source catalogue , including x - ray source detection , flux estimation and optical identification , is described in georgakakis & nandra ( 2011 ) .",
    "the xmm / sdss survey includes pointings targeting clusters of galaxies .",
    "the overdensity of sources in those fields may bias large scale structure studies .",
    "therefore xmm / sdss survey fields that have clusters as their prime targets are excluded from the analysis .",
    "these observations are identified from the target name keyword of the event files .",
    "this reduces the total xmm / sdss survey area to 102@xmath18 .",
    "the low redshift x - ray subsample of the xmm / sdss survey consists of 175 serendipitous hard - band ( 2 - 8kev ) and 297 full - band ( 0.5 - 8kev ) detections with @xmath2 , x - ray luminosity @xmath19 ( see below ) and @xmath20mag after correcting for galactic extinction ( schlegel et al .",
    "the magnitude cut corresponds to the limit of the sdss main galaxy sample ( strauss et al .",
    "2002 ) , which provides the majority of redshifts in the sdss .",
    "the photometry is from the new york university value - added galaxy catalog ( nyu - vagc , blanton et al .",
    "2005 ) which corresponds to the sdss dr7 ( abazajianet al .",
    "the x - ray luminosity cut is to limit the sample to agn which contribute substantially to the x - ray luminosity density of the universe at low redshift ( e.g. aird et al .",
    "2010 ) . as discussed by georgakakis et al .",
    "( 2011 ) contamination by normal galaxies is not a concern for luminosities @xmath21 .",
    "clustering results are presented for both the full and the hard - band selected agn samples .",
    "the former has the advantage of larger size , thereby improving the statistical reliability of the results .",
    "the latter is selected at rest - frame energies of about 2 - 9kev at @xmath22 , which are similar to those of chandra and xmm x - ray agn samples at @xmath8 ( typically 1 - 14kev ) .",
    "this facilitates the comparison across redshift by minimising differential selection effects .",
    "x - ray luminosities are estimated in the 2 - 10kev band after correcting the observed flux in the 2 - 8kev band ( hard - band selected sample ) or the 0.5 - 8kev band ( full - band selected sample ) for intrinsic absorption parametrised by the hydrogen column density , @xmath23 . for individual x - ray agn this quantity is determined from the hardness ratios between the soft ( 0.5 - 2kev ) and the hard ( 2 - 8kev ) x - ray bands assuming an intrinsic power - law x - ray spectrum with index @xmath24 ( nandra et al .",
    "because the low redshift subset ( @xmath2 and @xmath20mag ) of the xmm / sdss survey source catalogue is small , we choose to quantify their clustering properties by estimating their cross - correlation function with the much larger sample of sdss spectroscopically identified galaxies .",
    "we use the nyu - vagc to select a total of 592,017 sources in the sdss main galaxy spectroscopic sample ( bitmask parameter vag_select equals 7 ) with redshifts in the interval @xmath25 and extinction corrected magnitudes @xmath20mag .",
    "incompleteness in the galaxy redshift catalogue because of fiber collisions is a source of bias in clustering studies .",
    "the sdss fibers have finite size and can not be placed closer than 55arcsec , which corresponds to about @xmath26 at @xmath22 .",
    "this separation is too small to affect our results and conclusions as the x - ray / galaxy cross - correlation signal is dominated by pairs on much larger scales ( see results section ) .",
    "we nevertheless correct for this effect by assigning a source that was not observed because of fiber collisions the redshift of the galaxy with which it collided , as proposed by blanton et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "the determination of the cross - correlation function with a large sample of galaxies is superior to the estimation of the auto - correlation function in the case of small samples , like x - ray agn , because random errors are significantly suppressed .",
    "an additional advantage is that the cross - correlation requires knowledge of the selection function of galaxies only , which is less complex than that of x - ray agn .",
    "also , sample variance is affecting in the same way x - ray agn and galaxies . the impact of this bias is therefore minimised in the cross@xmath27correlation function calculation .",
    "the cross - correlation approach however , requires an accurate estimate of the auto - correlation function of galaxies to infer the clustering properties of agn .",
    "next we present the equations used to determine the clustering of agn . since both the auto - correlation and the cross - correlation functions are special cases of the 2-point statistics of the agn and galaxy populations , they are both defined by the same basic equations . in this section the term correlation function refers to either the auto - correlation or the cross - correlation functions .",
    "when necessary we will differentiate between the two quantities .",
    "the real space correlation function , @xmath28 , is calculated as    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the number of random points , @xmath31 is the number of galaxies , @xmath32 are the data - data pairs at separation @xmath33 , i.e. agn - galaxy pairs in the cross - correlation function or galaxy - galaxy pairs in the case of the auto - correlation function , @xmath34 are the agn - random pairs ( cross - correlation ) or galaxy - random pairs ( galaxy auto - correlation function ) at separation @xmath33 .",
    "random points within the surveyed area are produced by randominsing the positions of sdss galaxies taking into account the sdss window function and the spectroscopic completeness of the galaxy sample .",
    "the random catalogues provided as part of the nyu - vagc data release version 7.2 are used .",
    "they contain @xmath35 more randoms than galaxies .",
    "the random points are distributed with constant surface density in the sdss footprint as defined by the large scale structure mask of nyu - vagc ( blanton et al .",
    "the redshifts assigned to the randoms points follow the redshift distribution of the galaxy sample .    when the correlation function is measured in redshift - space , the clustering",
    "is affected at small scales by the rms velocity dispersion of agn along the line of sight and by dynamical infall of matter into higher density regions .",
    "if @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the distances of two objects 1 , 2 , measured in redshift - space , and @xmath38 the angular separation between them , then @xmath39 and @xmath40 are defined as    @xmath41    @xmath42    these are small angle approximations .",
    "equation @xmath43 then becomes :    @xmath44    to the first order , the non - linear redshift - space distortions , i.e. the small - scale peculiar velocities , appear only in the radial component .",
    "these effects are therefore minimised by integrating @xmath28 along the @xmath40 direction .",
    "the resulting two - point statistic is the projected correlation function    @xmath45    in practice the maximum scale of the integration is set to @xmath46 ( da @xmath11ngela et al .",
    "if larger scales are included , the signal will be dominated by noise .",
    "if the integration is limited on small scales the amplitude will be underestimated .    in the estimation of the projected agn / galaxy cross - correlation function",
    "each agn is weighted by the factor @xmath47 , the inverse of the maximum volume within which a source can be detected .",
    "this accounts for the complex selection function of the xmm / sdss agn .",
    "because of vignetting and the spatially varying width of the xmm s point spread function ( psf ) the solid angle within which the surveyed area is sensitive to x - ray faint sources is smaller than for brighter ones . as a result lower luminosity agn are underepresented in the low redshift subset of the xmm / sdss survey , but in a way that can be accurately quantified and corrected for in the @xmath48 calculation .",
    "it is emphasised that this is a second order correction and does not have a strong impact on the results and conclusions . for simplicity",
    "this weight is not included in the equations presented in this section .    under the assumption that the real - space correlation function follows a power - law of the form @xmath49 ,",
    "the real - space correlation length , @xmath50 , and slope , @xmath51 , can be estimated directly from the projected correlation function    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the gamma function .",
    "this is because equation [ eqn : wp ] can be rewritten as    @xmath54    and then solved analytically by substituting the power - law form for @xmath55 .",
    "the projected correlation function can also be used to estimate the real - space correlation function , @xmath56 , even if a power law form is not adopted . by inverting @xmath57 ( saunders et al .",
    "1992 )    @xmath58    and assuming a step function for @xmath59 it is found    @xmath60    for @xmath61 . that measurement is generally more noisy than @xmath57 .",
    "the projected correlation function and equation @xmath62 are therefore used to infer @xmath50 and @xmath51 , under the assumption of power - law for @xmath28 .",
    "however , we check that the @xmath50 and @xmath51 values obtained by equation @xmath62 provide a good approximation to the real - space correlation function infered from equation [ eqn : xir_2 ] .",
    "the above procedure allows us to measure the agn - galaxy projected cross - correlation function , @xmath63 , and the galaxy projected auto - correlation function , @xmath64 .",
    "using these measurements and assuming a linear bias , the agn projected auto - correlation function , @xmath65 , is    @xmath66    for the estimation of errors of the correlation function measurements the survey area is split into six subregions , each of which includes nearly equal number of x - ray agn . the cross - correlation function",
    "is then estimated for each of the six subregions .",

    "the bias parameter of agn relative to the underlying dark matter halo distribution is estimated using two different approaches that are often adopted in the literature .",
    "this is to facilitate direct comparison of our results with previous studies .",

    "our @xmath57 measurements are used .",
    "the galaxy bias , @xmath74 , is estimated as    @xmath75    where @xmath76 is the integrated correlation function of dark matter .",

    "they used the xmm - cosmos field to estimate dark matter halos in excess of @xmath107 for powerful x - ray sources .",
    "this suggests that a substantial fraction of the accretion density in the universe is associated with dark matter haloes with masses @xmath108 , higher than what merger models predict .",

    "a more promising alternative is the model of ciotti & ostriker ( 2001 ) , in which stellar winds from evolved stars in quiescent early type galaxies provide the fuel to supply the smbh .",
    "the accretion energy heats the ambient gas , slowing down subsequent infall when the compton temperature of the emitted radiation is higher than the mean galactic gas temperature .",
    "evolution in this case is characterized by strong oscillations , in which very fast and energetic agn bursts are followed by longer periods during which the smbh is dormant .",
    "this fueling mode applies to elliptical galaxies , which reside , on average , in dark matter halos similar to those of our moderate luminosity agn sample .",
    "one approach for getting insights into the growth of smbh is to investigate how the baryonic matter evolves within the typical dark matter haloes that agn are found .",

    "a key result from the studies above is that the ratio of galaxy to halo mass shows a peak at the dark matter mass scale of about @xmath111 , which depends only mildly on redshift , and then decreases at higher / lower masses ( e.g. leauthaud et al .",
    "2011 , conroy & wechsler 2009 ) .",

    "in contrast , moderate luminosity x - ray agn at both @xmath1 and @xmath8 ( e.g. coil et al . 2009 ) live in haloes that are , on average , offset from the sites where star - formation proceeds more efficiently .",
    "the typical dark matter halo of these systems ( @xmath112 ) corresponds to the scale where satellites start to dominate the stellar mass budget of the halo ( e.g. leauthaud et al . 2011 ) , i.e. small and moderate size groups ( e.g. coil et al .",
    "this might indicate that moderate luminosity x - ray agn may be fueled by the cooling of hot gas associated with the group environment ( e.g. croton et al .",
    "2006 , bower et al .",
    "2006 ) . semi - analytic models that include prescriptions for the growth of smbhs predict that this accretion mode can produce luminosities comparable to those of the agn sample presented here ( e.g. fanidakis et al .",
    "2011 ) . alternatively",
    ", the increasing importance of satellites in the integrated stellar mass of @xmath113 haloes suggests that they may play a role in the activation of the smbh , e.g. via tidal interactions or mergers with the central galaxy of the halo .",
    "semi - analytic models of galaxy evolution ( e.g. bower et al . 2006 , de lucia & blaizot 2007 ) predict that the main route of stellar mass growth since @xmath114 of the central galaxies of haloes with present - day mass @xmath115 are mergers with satellites ( zehavi et al .",
    "as long as agn are associated with the central galaxy of a halo ( e.g. starikova et al .",
    "2010 ) , such gravitational interactions may also be responsible for triggering accretion of material onto the central smbh .",
    "we caution however , that studies that connect stellar and halo masses in a phenomenological way find contradictory results on the importance of mergers in haloes with present - day mass @xmath116 .",
    "conroy & weschsler ( 2009 ) argue that in such haloes star - formation is primarily responsible for the growth of the stellar mass of the central galaxies since @xmath8 .",
    "in contrast , zheng et al .",
    "( 2007 ) find that mergers with smaller galaxies , either satellites or central galaxies of smaller haloes , drive the stellar mass assembly since @xmath8 in those haloes , in qualitative agreement with sams ( zehavi et al .",
    "the discrepancy is likely related to the way galaxies are associated with dark matter haloes in different studies and the assumptions adopted to determine the contributions of star - formation and merging to the stellar mass assembly .",
    "a limitation of schemes that connect galaxies to dark matter haloes is that they describe the average stellar mass growth as a function of both galaxy and halo mass .",
    "there is however , evidence that moderate luminosity agn hosts are different from the typical galaxy that lives in haloes similar to those of agn . using the results of behroozi et al .",
    "( 2010 , their table 3 ) we find that dark matter haloes with masses of @xmath117 at @xmath22 and @xmath114 are predicted to have central galaxies with mean stellar masses of about @xmath118 and @xmath119 , respectively .",
    "the scatter in stellar mass at a fixed halo mass is about 0.16dex ( behroozi et al . 2010 ) .",
    "moderate luminosity x - ray agn hosts however , have a broad stellar mass distribution ( e.g. shi et al .",
    "2008 , bundy et al . 2008 , georgakakis et al .",
    "2011 ) . using the stellar mass function of x - ray agn from georgakakis et al .",
    "( 2011 ) for example , we estimate mean stellar masses of about @xmath120 at @xmath1 and @xmath121 @xmath122 with a variance of about 0.4dex at both redshifts .",
    "this indicates that x - ray agn , for their dark matter haloes , live in smaller than average galaxies in terms of stellar mass .",
    "x - ray agn hosts have therefore experienced less merging and/or less star - formation ( possibly due to feedback processes associated with the central engine ) compared to typical galaxies in dark matter haloes of similar mass . alternatively , this might be interpreted as evidence that a fraction of the x - ray agn are not associated with the central galaxies of their haloes but with satellites , which are expected to have a much wider stellar mass function ( e.g. leauthaud et al . 2011 ) .",
    "recent studies on the halo occupation distribution of agn suggest that at least some of them live in sattelite galaxies ( e.g. padmanabhan et ak .",
    "2009 , miyaji et al , 2011 ) .",
    "contrary to that , starikova et al .",
    "( 2010 ) find that x - ray agn reside close to the centres of their dark matter haloes and tend to avoid satellites .",
    "evidence that x - ray agn are in lower mass galaxies for their dark matter haloes already exists in the literature .",
    "coil et al .",
    "( 2009 ) find that galaxies hosting x - ray agn are more likely to reside in more massive dark matter halos than the overall galaxy population of the same color and optical luminosity .",
    "digby north et al . ( 2011 ) also found that x - ray agn live on average in higher density environments compared to stellar - mass matched galaxy samples .",
    "the xmm / sdss survey is used to constrain the clustering of moderate luminosity ( @xmath123 ) x - ray selected agn at @xmath1 .",
    "these sources are found to reside in haloes with mass of about @xmath124 .",
    "comparison with studies at higher redshift , suggest that this halo mass scale corresponds to the typical environment of x - ray agn in the luminosity interval above at least out to @xmath8 .",
    "haloes with masses @xmath125 correspond to the group scale , where satellites dominated the stellar mass budget of the halo .",
    "this suggests that either accretion of hot gas associated with the group environment or interactions of the central galaxy with satellites are responsible for the activation of the smbh in our agn sample .",
    "splitting the agn sample by colours shows that those with red colours are more clustered than those in blue colours .",
    "this is in agreement with results at higher redshift , @xmath8 .",
    "we do not find a dependence of clustering on obscuration or accretion luminosity . a wider luminosity baseline than that spanned by our sample is probably needed to explore trends of the agn clustering with @xmath126 .",
    "there is also evidence that the hosts of moderate luminosity x - ray agn have lower stellar masses compared to the typical galaxy in haloes of the same size .",
    "this may have important implications for understanding the conditions under which supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies grow .",
