    "observations of a wide variety of astronomical objects suggests the existence of magnetic fields in relativistic environments .",
    "there have been many studies of magnetic fields emanating from differentially rotating systems .",
    "some of them confine themselves to the non - relativistic regime in which the displacement currents can be neglected .",
    "even then few of them are analytic e.g. @xcite , @xcite , , @xcite , while most of them are computational e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in the force - free case",
    "it was shown that the time evolution of the magnetic field arises solely from the time dependence of the boundary conditions so that the exact dynamical evolution can be calculated from the time dependent sequence of static models @xcite .",
    "those in turn can be derived from the energy principle .",
    "however , that simplification depends on both the force - free condition and the neglect of the displacement currents which is only valid when the velocities are much less than @xmath5 .",
    "relativistic problems are harder as that approximation is invalid , so most studies are purely computational e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite or semi - analytical e.g. @xcite .    despite this , @xcite was able to find an exact solution to the relativistic mhd problem of a point magnetic explosion .",
    "he derived a time dependent relativistic analogue of the grad - shafranov equation that governs axially symmetric force - free mhd by assuming that the radial coordinate and the time since the explosion only appear in the dimensionless combination @xmath6 . strictly speaking such equations",
    "are only valid when the length scale and @xmath7 the time scale of the region of the explosion are much smaller than @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the resulting prendergast equation is non - linear but becomes linear in a special case .",
    "it was this special case that prendergast studied in detail .",
    "however , he found that there are spherical nodes where the radial magnetic field is zero and these nodes occur before the highly relativistic regime @xmath10 is reached .",
    "this has the unfortunate consequence that magnetic field lines emanating from small @xmath8 turn back before they reach the extremely relativistic region where the displacement currents are very important .",
    "the field lines in that region are an appendage unattached to their origin .",
    "very similar effects are well known when one takes the analogous case , @xmath11 with @xmath12 constant , in non - relativistic mhd in spherical coordinates .",
    "when @xmath13 becomes large , the system gives way to oscillating solutions with a series of nodes .",
    "this difficulty occurs because @xmath14 has dimension @xmath15 and the field has to vary on this fixed length scale even at large r. at large distances there is too much current for unit field and the smaller scale is then reflected in the scale of oscillation .",
    "it is known that non - linear ansatzes for the non - relativistic grad - shafranov equation can avoid this , which we now recognise as a bad consequence of a mathematically simple linear approximation which is not generally justified in the physics of the problem .",
    "we shall therefore study the non - linear prendergast equation in all its glory !",
    "we generalise the idea of force - free fields by considering a configuration where for each point there exists a lorentz frame in which the electric field is zero and the current is along the magnetic field . the force density @xmath16 in the frame fixed at the origin is then :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the velocity of the moving frame . in this paper , we study such fields by solving the equation proposed by @xcite .",
    "however , before stepping to a solution , we extract as much information as possible about the fields that is independent of the detailed form of the solution .",
    "then we solve the equations semi - analytically as it impossible to achieve general analytical solutions .",
    "the solutions simplify in the non - relativistic limit and converge to those of @xcite .",
    "there are some other cases that are interesting and exactly soluble , namely the current - free magnetic dipole and the linear force - free field of prendergast .",
    "the introduction of currents in the system allows the existence of a toroidal component of the field at the cost of making analytical solutions much harder , however it is still possible to design analytical solutions for this structure .",
    "in accordance to prendergast s formalism we consider an electromagnetic field configuration for which there is at least one frame of reference at each point of space where the electric field vanishes and the magnetic field is parallel to the electric current .",
    "we denote these frames and the physical quantities appearing there by a prime .",
    "we take each of these frames to move uniformly with velocity @xmath6 .",
    "although each frame moves uniformly away from the origin and at each moment those frames further from the origin move faster , we are not using the expanding coordinates of cosmology .",
    "the frame of reference of the observer at the origin is the unprimed frame .",
    "the primed frames of reference move radially with respect to the unprimed frame under the scaled velocity @xmath19    @xmath20    then we may write for the primed frame of reference :    @xmath21    @xmath22    the magnetic field in the unprimed frame of reference is    @xmath23    where @xmath24 .",
    "the electric field in the unprimed frame of reference is    @xmath25    the electric current in the unprimed frame of reference is    @xmath26    by virtue of @xmath27 , @xmath28 , the self - similarity condition and ( 1 ) we re - express the fields in terms of the flux function @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 is the magnetic flux through the cap of a sphere of radius @xmath8 subtending a semi - angle @xmath32 at the origin , and @xmath30 is related to the toroidal component @xmath33 and to the specific torque carried by field lines between @xmath29 and @xmath34 . remembering that @xmath6 and @xmath35 we have    @xmath36,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "@xmath37.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now we substitute the currents ( 7 ) and the electric and magnetic fields into @xmath38 and finally take into account charge conservation to get prendergast s equation for the flux function    @xmath39    in prendergast s notation @xmath40 is @xmath41 and our @xmath29 and @xmath30 are @xmath42 times his .    the toroidal part @xmath30 is related to the source function @xmath43 by    @xmath44    our task is to determine the function @xmath29 by solving the partial differential equation ( 10 ) .",
    "this is not a straightforward task ; even under a numerical treatment of the problem , the solution depends on the form of the source function @xmath43 chosen .",
    "our strategy for solving equation ( 10 ) is + 1 . to study the non - relativistic limit so as to see how it connects to earlier work .",
    "+ 2 . to study the elementary case when there are no currents in the body of the plasma .",
    "the resulting self - similar solutions of maxwell s equations become singular at r = ct if the fields at the origin are turned on suddenly . we demonstrate how these singularities disappear when the fields are turned on over a small finite time .",
    "find what form of source function @xmath45 allows solutions of ( 10 ) that are separable in @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the special form of @xmath45 required can not be made to vanish at @xmath48 .",
    "however it gives an exact solution in regions where p is above a certain threshold , @xmath49 , where @xmath50 .",
    "when @xmath29 is below that threshold the field joins smoothly to one with no currents .",
    "+ 4 . the current - free solutions in this outer cocoon",
    "are not of product form but are found by analysis into suitable harmonics whose coefficients are computed to high accuracy .",
    "thus we end with a global solution that expands with the velocity of light within a narrow prescribed cone .",
    "it has high fields but no charges near @xmath51 .",
    "below that we enter the current free cocoon , soon followed by the basic relativistic solution of product form which is accompanied by charges and currents .",
    "in this section we focus on the properties of the field .",
    "it may seem more natural to achieve a solution for equation ( 10 ) and then investigate the details of the field .",
    "however it is possible to obtain some physical understanding by studying general properties of the field that do not depend on the details of the solution .",
    "we seek frames of reference where the electric field vanishes .",
    "such frames are particularly interesting as they determine the velocity of the field and allow us to trace the time evolution of the magnetic field lines @xcite .",
    "the setup of the problem gives an initial set of frames obeying this property , the uniformly expanding ones .",
    "indeed the motion of the field lines may be viewed as a simple expansion .",
    "a charge @xmath52 that is placed at distance @xmath53 from the origin at time @xmath54 with velocity @xmath55 , does not feel any force , as there is no electric field and the magnetic field in this frame has no effect on a particle at rest in it .",
    "the particle will remain on the same magnetic field line as those are determined by @xmath29 which in turn is a function of @xmath6 .",
    "however , as the fields have components in the all three directions the velocity field of uniform expansion is not perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "conventionally the velocity of field lines is chosen to be perpendicular to them .",
    "we examine other frames of reference where there is no electric field . in order to find such frames we use the following quadratic equation for the velocity field @xmath56 @xcite , that describes frames of reference where the magnetic and the electric fields are parallel to each other    @xmath57    this velocity field is clearly perpendicular to @xmath58 .",
    "given that the electric and the magnetic field by construction satisfy @xmath59 , which is a relativistic field invariant , we conclude that in a frame where @xmath60 either the electric or the magnetic field vanishes .",
    "thus equation ( 12 ) may be used to define the velocity of the magnetic field .",
    "however the general velocity @xmath61 of a frame in which @xmath62 and @xmath63 are parallel allows boosts in the direction of the magnetic field and only determines the motion in the direction transverse to the magnetic field .",
    "the solution of the above quadratic equation gives the velocity we are interested in , however it is feasible to achieve a simpler formula for the motion of the field lines .",
    "equation ( 1 ) yields that @xmath64 .",
    "any velocity field of the form    @xmath65    for arbitrary @xmath66 , gives a set of frames of reference where the electric field vanishes .",
    "the lorentz transformation of the electric field is given by @xcite    @xmath67    substituting ( 13 ) into ( 14 ) and working the cross products we obtain that @xmath68 .",
    "therefore equation ( 13 ) gives the general velocities that can be attributed to the field lines ; we follow @xcite in using the expression for @xmath69 which gives a velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "this is a solution to ( 12 ) provided @xmath70 . by virtue of equations ( 8) and ( 9 )",
    "we find that the usual velocity field is    @xmath71,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath72    @xmath73    relations ( 15)-(17 ) give the details of the motion of the field lines . at the first instance we can make some reasonable assumptions for the flux function @xmath29 .",
    "a magnetic field consists of field lines rising from and returning to an imaginary spherical cap of radius @xmath53 and confined between angles @xmath74 and @xmath75 corresponding to @xmath76 and @xmath77 . in the case of a dipole field instead of",
    "a spherical cap we have the whole spherical surface , and @xmath78 .",
    "the flux function @xmath29 is zero at the boundaries and has a single maximum at @xmath79 where the field lines turn back .",
    "the toroidal component @xmath30 has to obey @xmath80 approaching the edges and normally the decrease has to be such so there is no singularity .",
    "the above assumption allows the determination of the signs of the derivatives appearing at relations ( 15)-(17 )",
    ". therefore @xmath81 , as there can not be any flux generated as the field moves upwards ; @xmath82 for @xmath83 ; @xmath82 for @xmath84 and @xmath85 at @xmath79 .",
    "we conclude that the field lines viewed this way perform a complex motion that consists of a non - uniform radial expansion ; a meridional motion where the parts of the field lines that lie in @xmath86 move in the direction of @xmath87 , those in @xmath88 in the direction of @xmath89 ; and an azimuthal motion where the parts of the field lines lying in @xmath88 move in the direction of @xmath90 and the rest in the direction of @xmath91 .",
    "the magnitude of the velocity depends on the details of the solution and can not be determined by the previous arguments .",
    "the parameter @xmath47 , that is the expansion velocity scaled to the speed of light gives an estimate of the importance of the relativistic terms for the problem . in the limit of @xmath92 equation ( 10 ) becomes ,    @xmath93    equation ( 18 ) is similar to the grad - shafranov equation for axisymmetric magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "there are many solutions of this equation in astrophysical context , . amongst these solutions",
    "the most appropriate to our case is that of @xcite where the field is a self - similar quadruple . in our first paradigm",
    "we are going to apply this solution to a self - similar dipole .    assuming a self - similar solution we set @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is a flux normalisation , formally the maximum flux at @xmath96 ,",
    "so that the angular part of the flux @xmath97 , therefore equation ( 18 ) becomes    @xmath98    in order to achieve self - similar solutions we need @xmath99 . with @xmath29 a product of a function of @xmath47 and a function of @xmath46 , @xmath45 can only be proportional to a power of @xmath47 if @xmath43 itself is a power of @xmath29 , since @xmath29 is proportional to @xmath100 the required power is given by    @xmath101    a more detailed derivation is given in @xcite .",
    "setting @xmath102 , equation ( 19 ) reduces to    @xmath103    to solve equation ( 21 ) in a sphere we apply the boundary conditions @xmath104 , and determine @xmath105 by the condition that @xmath106 has a single maximum @xmath107 .",
    "these conditions are sufficient to solve the equation for any @xmath108 . for @xmath109",
    "the solution is @xmath110 and @xmath111 , for @xmath108 small the solution of ( 21 ) takes the form @xmath112 and in general for intermediate values it is solved numerically . therefore the fields take the following form in this non - relativistic limit    @xmath113,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath114.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the motion of the field lines can be found by equations ( 15)-(17 ) by applying the fields given at ( 22 ) and ( 23 ) .",
    "@xmath115.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this case is different to the grad - shafranov equation , as in the latter the field only depends on @xmath8 whereas here the field depends on @xmath116 .",
    "however , a snapshot of the configuration for any given @xmath117 satisfies the grad - shafranov equation .",
    "when there are no source terms on the right , equation ( 10 ) gives simple relativistic solutions with no toroidal magnetic field component .    in this section",
    "we study this case ; we show that one solution reduces to a linearly increasing magnetic dipole , where the field is zero outside a sphere expanding at the speed of light",
    ".    with @xmath118 equation ( 10 ) reduces to the simple form    @xmath119    by using ogilvie s transformation @xmath120 equation ( 25 ) becomes    @xmath121    we use the technique of separation of variables ; let @xmath122 and dash denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath123 , equation ( 26 ) becomes    @xmath124    equation ( 27 ) for @xmath125 is the legendre differential equation , therefore the solution is a linear combination of @xmath126 , that has to be finite in the interval @xmath127 , therefore @xmath128 , as @xmath129 becomes infinite at @xmath130 .    the angular part can be solved analytically using the following transformation @xcite , @xmath131 , therefore the second equality of ( 27 ) becomes :    @xmath132    this is again the legendre differential equation , and the solution for the angular part of @xmath29 is @xmath133 .",
    "therefore the flux function of the field is    @xmath134      let us consider @xmath109 , that corresponds to a field where a dipole of magnetic moment @xmath135 is initiated at @xmath136 .",
    "following the formalism of @xcite for the hertzian dipole modified for a magnetic dipole we can express the electric and the magnetic fields using the quantity @xmath137 which is a vector pointing at the axis of dipole @xmath138 and is a function of position and time ; dot denotes derivation with respect to @xmath9    @xmath139    @xmath140    it is shown in appendix a that for any function @xmath141    @xmath142    and the fields satisfy maxwell s equations .",
    "the fields are :    @xmath143    @xmath144    therefore , we can evaluate the electric and the magnetic fields for a linearly increasing dipole that is switched on at @xmath136 and lies at @xmath145 , it corresponds to @xmath146 , where @xmath147 is the heaviside function which is unity for argument greater than zero and zero otherwise .",
    "we divide the space into three regions .",
    "the first one ( i ) is @xmath148 ; the second ( ii ) is the surface @xmath51 and the third ( iii ) is @xmath149 . in the first region",
    "there is an electromagnetic field because of the dipole ; in the the third region the field is zero , as the message of switching on the dipole has not arrived yet ; the second region is the horizon surface of discontinuity .",
    "therefore in region ( i ) the fields are :    @xmath150    @xmath151    since the fields are related to derivatives of @xmath152 and the first derivative of @xmath152 is discontinuous at @xmath153 we expect singularities on the surface @xmath51 ( ii ) .",
    "indeed there are singular surface fields .",
    "these infinities we should have expected because in the analogous electric dipole case velocities are suddenly imposed on the charges to make the linearly growing dipole . thus initial accelerations are infinite so the power radiated should be singular .",
    "@xmath154    @xmath155    these fields are unacceptable . in region",
    "( iii ) there are no fields at all . to avoid the singularities in ( ii ) we take into account the finite time needed to accelerate the dipole to a given growth rate . to do this we smooth by averaging the fields over a small spread @xmath156 of switch - on times .",
    "thus region ( i ) now extends @xmath157 , region ( ii ) spreads into a spherical shell @xmath158 and ( iii ) @xmath159 .",
    "@xmath160 becomes :    @xmath161    this substitution increases the complexity of the formulae for the fields but removes the singularity at the horizon and allows us to study in greater detail the structure of the field near the horizon and how it depends on the time - scale for the dipole to establish a linear behaviour .",
    "the fields corresponding to @xmath162 are given by putting @xmath162 into ( 33 ) and ( 34 )    @xmath163    @xmath164    @xmath165    these are perfectly regular and acceptable .",
    "the higher order self - similar multipoles are given in appendix b.      in the previous sections we have given analytical expressions consisting of magnetic fields that lie on the meridional planes and electric fields that are azimuthal ; such fields do not contain currents , or charge densities and each arises from a growing multipole at the origin . in this section",
    "we seek analytical solutions for electromagnetic fields in which the magnetic field has an azimuthal component , the electric has a meridional component and there are charge and current densities in the space .",
    "we need to solve ( 10 ) , prendergast s equation .",
    "we seek a solution that is a product of a function depending on @xmath47 and one depending on @xmath46 ; using the usual transformation @xmath166 equation ( 10 ) reduces to    @xmath167+(1-\\mu^{2})\\frac{\\partial^{2}p}{\\partial \\mu^{2}}=-\\frac{1}{u^{2}-1}\\beta \\frac{d \\beta}{d p}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we multiply by @xmath168 and look for solutions in the form of @xmath169    @xmath170+(u^{2}-1)\\frac{1-\\mu^{2}}{f}\\frac{d^{2}f}{d\\mu^{2}}= \\nonumber \\\\ = -\\frac{\\beta}{p}\\frac{d\\beta}{dp}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we set :    @xmath171,\\\\ m(\\mu)=\\frac{1-\\mu^{2}}{f}\\frac{d^{2}f}{d\\mu^{2}},\\\\ \\frac{\\beta}{p}\\frac{d\\beta}{dp}=q(p),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    so the equation takes the form :    @xmath172    operating with @xmath173 we find    @xmath174    which is of the form @xmath175 , with @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "taking logs and operating with @xmath178 we find that ( i ) @xmath179 or alternatively ( ii ) @xmath180 which leads to prendergast s linear model @xmath181 .",
    "henceforward we consider only case ( i ) , @xmath182 is not constant since @xmath29 can not be a function of @xmath183 alone , so both @xmath184 and @xmath185 must equal the same constant @xmath186 .",
    "this is a generalisation of the @xmath108 used before in the current free case .",

    "@xmath200    evidently we must choose @xmath201 , so the first is satisfied and @xmath202 so the second is too .",
    "however in the non - relativistic approximation @xmath203 so then the second equation is all negligible compared with the first .    from the definition of @xmath204 we have :    @xmath205    so    @xmath206    and by normalising @xmath207 , so @xmath208    @xmath209    which is the same equation as that studied by @xcite , who found it in non - relativistic mhd .",

    "elsewhere we choose @xmath238 , the current - free solution .",
    "we avoid the use of the linear form @xmath239 because those solutions have an infinity of oscillations in the sign of @xmath29 as they approach @xmath130 ( see prendergast 2005 ) .",

    "we determine the fringing field in the cocoon region @xmath234 .",
    "we choose the boundary to be a cone with a total opening angle ( not semi - angle ) of less than @xmath241 .",

    "it is just that legendre polynomials or more generally legendre functions of @xmath46 replace the simpler bessel functions of the narrow cone cases .      since our main applications will be the jets and @xmath4-ray bursts it makes sense to study solutions within conical boundaries with quite narrow cones @xmath242 .",
    "provided the total opening angle ( not the semi - angle ) of the cone is less than @xmath241 the actual opening angle does not affect the form of the solution whereas at larger angles it does .",
    "thus there is a real advantage in studying the small angle case which allows us to replace high order legendre functions of angles by bessel functions of order 1 .",
    "the @xmath243 limit comes from our replacement of @xmath244 by 2 .",
    "the fractional error in neglecting @xmath245 as compared with 2 is @xmath246 which is less than @xmath247 for @xmath248    in the region where @xmath234 , @xmath232 is zero so the solutions of ( 43 ) that we need , have no currents , however they are solutions with a very awkward boundary on @xmath249 . in place of trying to fit a current - free solution on that boundary to our known solution within the region with @xmath234 we adopt the current - free solutions within the whole cone as our complete set .",
    "we expand the known right hand side of equation ( 43 ) in terms of our bessel functions of angle within the cone .",

    "the energy is mainly concentrated near the base of the jet and near the top of the jet .",
    "it is expected that the energy is strong near the base as the fields decrease with distance from the centre .",

    "that time scale determines the energy of the initial pulse ; it is inversely proportional to the time - scale of switching on the dipole .",
    "the physical system we have in mind is the following : as the core of a massive star collapses to form a compact object or a black hole it spins much faster and winds up the magnetic field where it connects to the rest of the star or to any disc that may form .",

    "we apply the self - similar solutions inside a narrow cone .",
    "these give a total energy of order @xmath3 in the jet from which @xmath358 is due to the switching on of the field concentrated in a very thin layer just below the light sphere .",
    "the width of this layer is @xmath359 and the fields contained are of order @xmath360 whereas the field at the main body of the jet at @xmath361 is of order of @xmath362 .",

    "@xmath364    @xmath365      the total energy depends on @xmath108 ( figures 10 and 11 ) .",
    "it can be seen ( tables 1 and 2 ; figures 4 and 5 ) that @xmath108 parametrises the twist .",
    "we prefer the use of the twist as parameter as it describes a physical process rather than @xmath108 which is just an index .",
    "thus a decrease in @xmath108 can be viewed as an increase on the differential rotation at the base .",
    "when differential rotation is imposed at the base there is a toroidal component in the field which increases the energy of the configuration , and in addition to that the poloidal part of the field expands to reach a force free state .",
    "this dual process leads to an increase in the total energy .",

    "we now apply the poynting theorem for the expanding volume    @xmath371    as opposed to the usual form for the poynting theorem , there is an extra term in the right hand side because of the expansion of the volume .",

    "thus the energy flows towards smaller @xmath47 .",
    "nevertheless the energy flow relative to fixed axes is outwards everywhere .",
    "this discrepancy occurs because the energy flow as described by the poynting vector is slower than the velocity due to the uniform expansion .",
    "the region at the top has to be treated separately . near the top @xmath373 and it is only the component due to @xmath374 that contributes to the energy . the energy in the top is compressed in a thin shell ( region ii ) .",
    "the width of this shell is @xmath355 .",
    "thus near the top the flux function drops from @xmath375 to @xmath74 within a distance @xmath355 as described in appendix b for the smoothing of the fields in the case of self - similar multipoles .",
    "@xmath375 is approximated with good accuracy by @xmath376 , where @xmath49 is defined for equation ( 62 ) and @xmath377 is the solution to equation ( 56 ) , note that the exact value of @xmath375 is not given by equation ( 63 ) but it is a sum of multiples of bessel and legendre functions .",
    "after we smooth the field we find that the energy contained in region ii    @xmath378    thus the energy of the shell ( region ii ) is constant .",
    "as the pressure of the magnetic field is proportional to @xmath379 for the case of the self - similar solutions in the non - relativistic region the field shall demand a special pressure environment so that it is contained within a cone .",
    "let us assume that the pressure of the surrounding medium is described by a power - law @xmath380 , thus as the field is differentially rotated it will expand primarily up the axis and if the index of the pressure of the medium @xmath381 is greater that @xmath382 then the jet will not have a constant opening angle but will expand sideways .      near the top",
    "the case is rather different , as there is a particularly strong ram pressure .",
    "this is because the head of the jet encounters the gas of the medium in a velocity @xmath383 that is close to the speed of light , let this velocity correspond to some lorentz factor @xmath4 . as there is only a @xmath348 component there , in the comoving frame the magnetic field",
    "is :    @xmath384    this magnetic field encounters an environment of density    @xmath385    where @xmath386 is the density of the medium in its rest frame .",
    "the @xmath4 factor is because the coordinate in the direction of expansion is shrunk by a factor of @xmath4 .",
    "balance of momenta gives a stagnation pressure in the comoving frame    @xmath387    setting the stagnation pressure equal to the magnetic pressure of the top field we can determine the @xmath4 that the magnetic field reaches as it expands .",
    "this depends on the magnetic field and the density the jet encounters ; as @xmath348 and @xmath386 are known we can easily find the value of @xmath4 . for densities around @xmath388 a lorentz factor of @xmath389",
    "is found , whereas for densities smaller than @xmath390 lorentz factors greater than 10 are found , and for the case of an hii region surrounding a massive star the jet becomes extremely relativistic with @xmath391 .",
    "however , near the centre of the star the density greatly exceeds the value of @xmath392 , thus the jet pushes its way through the material at non - relativistic speeds .",
    "however it is possible that a funnel forms by an other mechanism . in the case of @xmath4-ray bursts",
    "there is a black hole formed in the centre of a rotating star thus , the material on the axis will fall into the black - hole .",
    "then there will be an underdense region on the axis allowing the expansion of the jet , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "relativistic jets were first found emanating from radio galaxies and quasars , then more spectacularly still from @xmath4-ray burst sources and microquasars .",
    "related but non - relativistic jets arise from young stars with accretion discs and generate herbig - haro objects .",
    "we consider that all these phenomena come from the magnetic energy generated when a magnetic field is wound up by the differential rotation of its footpoints .",
    "the opening angles of many of these jets is of order @xmath393 , giving semi angles of @xmath394 or so .",
    "it is believed that massive wolf - rayet stars in rapid rotation generate the long - soft @xmath4-ray bursts when their cores collapse eventually to make black holes and the associated supernovae @xcite .",
    "then the differential rotation is between the collapsing core of the star and the enclosing envelope .",
    "it has also been suggested that the outcome of the collapse is a strongly magnetised compact object @xcite releasing energy in magnetic field .",
    "this magnetic energy is generated by differential rotation deep within the star . while the strong magnetic field expands to balance the external gas pressure the density of the external envelope initially prevents relativistic expansion along the rotation axis . under expansion at constant flux the field in a magnetic bubble or cavity varies , with length scale , @xmath15 , as @xmath395 and the magnetic pressure as @xmath396 .",
    "thus while it is within the body of the star the magnetic cavity is collimated when the ambient pressure falls less rapidly than @xmath2 subtending smaller angles at the star s centre as @xmath8 increases .",
    "such configurations of non - relativistic jets were described in @xcite and references therein and have been applied to @xmath4-ray bursts by @xcite . in the outer parts of the star",
    "the pressure falls more rapidly than @xmath2 and the head of the magnetic cavity accelerates until it breaks through the stellar surface and expands relativistically .",
    "numerical studies of ultrarelativistic mhd jets have been done by @xcite , where it was found that high collimation angles can be achieved by a configuration where the toroidal component of the magnetic field dominates .",
    "when the central object is a rotating black hole then the kerr geometry was taken into account . in the case",
    "we study the main source of confinement is ram pressure on the low density stellar wind .",
    "in this paper we have solved analytically the equation proposed by prendergast for relativistically expanding axisymmetric self - similar force - free fields .",
    "this equation is a relativistically moving extension of the grad - shafranov equation for static force - free fields with axial symmetry .    to excellent accuracy",
    "our solution is given everywhere by equations ( 62 ) and ( 63 ) with the @xmath397 function given by equation ( 57 ) or more accurately ( 60 ) .",
    "the resulting electromagnetic fields are given by equations ( 8) and ( 9 ) .",
    "all solutions of the prendergast equation need to be averaged over a small time @xmath398 that corresponds to the light crossing time across the magnetic explosion .",
    "his equation assumes a point explosion .",
    "exact solutions of prendergast s equation give singular fields where the expansion speed is that of light but we have shown how averaging over @xmath398 yields genuine solutions of maxwell s equations without singularities .",
    "nevertheless this @xmath398 may be quite short and the resulting fields close to @xmath51 are strong , carrying around @xmath247 of the system s energy .",
    "this may be related to @xmath4-ray burst precursors . however , the fields at the top require further modification as the ram pressure of their relativistic motion is retarded by the interstellar medium",
    ". considerations as those of @xcite are clearly important there , whatever drives the shock waves and it is there that the eponymous @xmath4-rays themselves are generated .    while this paper has given a basic mechanism that produces highly relativistic motion there is a big gap between that and the phenomenology of @xmath4-ray bursts .    on the way to understanding the solutions of the fully relativistic prendergast equation",
    "we were led to give purely poloidal solutions of maxwell s equations for time - dependent multipoles , interesting in their own right .",
    "we have also seen how in the non - relativistic limit our problem is related to the solutions found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "finally we have seen how small opening angles of the cone correspond to greater coiling of the magnetic field and thus to mush greater concentration of energy into the jet .",
    "setting some values for the magnetic field quoted from the stronger magnetars we find that we can power jets up to the energies of @xmath4-ray bursts , for which the isotropic energy is between @xmath399 to @xmath400 erg @xcite . in the case",
    "studied we found that the energy inside the jet is of order @xmath401 , where the isotropic energy is two orders of magnitude greater .",
    "the very strong magnetic field found at the top of the magnetic configuration can oppose the strong ram pressure because of expansion and swipe material out of the way for the jet to expand .",
    "this feature may be related to the precursor observed in some @xmath4-ray bursts e.g. @xcite , as it is the first to break out and carries a small fraction of the energy of the @xmath4-ray burst .",
    "jets of narrow opening angles can be more twisted than those of wide opening angles , giving evidence that collimation increases with twist .",
    "finally a strong stagnation pressure is found at the head of the jet .",
    "it prevents the jet from being relativistic near the base but as it expands outwards and encounters underdense material it becomes extremely relativistic as is indeed observed in @xmath4-ray bursts .",

    "following the formalism of @xcite we express the electric and the magnetic fields in the following way , dot denotes differentiation with respect to time , @xmath139    @xmath402    the fields must satisfy maxwell s equations in vacuum . by construction",
    "they satisfy    @xmath403    @xmath404    the other two equations will let us determine function @xmath137 . substituting into @xmath405",
    "we take    @xmath406    and by substituting in the equation @xmath407 we have :    @xmath408    given that the fields that have physical meaning are expressed in forms of derivatives of @xmath137 we can choose it to satisfy the wave equation without overconstraining the fields .",
    "the proof that follows uses a gauge transformation of @xmath137 .",
    "@xmath409    for @xmath410 .",
    "indeed :    @xmath411    @xmath412    integrating equations ( a5 ) and ( a6 ) , we take :    @xmath413    where @xmath414 and @xmath415 . using the gauge transformation that leaves the fields unaffected as we have shown above",
    ", we can substitute in favour of @xmath416 , and equation ( a10 ) becomes :    @xmath417    note that the divergence of the rhs vanishes .",
    "thus by choosing    @xmath418    we can make the rhs of ( a11 ) vanish and therefore , equations ( a5 ) and ( a6 ) reduce to the wave equation .",
    "the next task is to solve the wave equation . in axial symmetry with @xmath137 along @xmath138 everywhere , the wave equation becomes :    @xmath419\\pi=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    when @xmath420 , the magnitude of @xmath137 , has spherical symmetry , the solution to the above equation describes a wave emerging from the centre and expanding outwards .",
    "it is    @xmath142    where @xmath141 is any function .",
    "it is possible to extend the idea of the hertzian dipole to describe a multipole .",
    "these multipoles have electric and magnetic fields confined between co - axial cones .",
    "it is possible to isolate and apply the solutions only within the central cone or between any two cones ignoring the rest of the field as there is no interaction between them . in order to find such solutions",
    ", the vector potential @xmath137 will be a function of @xmath8 , @xmath117 and @xmath32 .",
    "although it is possible to find general solutions for the wave equation in spherical coordinates , we can by demanding self - similarity , design a set of multipole solutions that coincide with the prendergast system .                      where @xmath147 is heaviside s step function and @xmath46 is @xmath428 . for @xmath429 ,",
    "zero satisfies equation ( b2 ) . in order to find the equivalence of these solutions to the prendergast fields in empty space we will check if the fields defined in ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) obey the conditions set in expressions ( 1 ) and ( 6 )      indeed ( b5 ) reduces to ( b2 ) after the differentiations are done",
    "; therefore , a field that obeys the self - similar wave equation , it will obey ( 1 ) and ( 6 ) as well .",
    "thus the hertzian multipole is equivalent to the multipole fields that obey the empty space prendergast equation .    to check that this solution ( b4 ) holds not merely for @xmath425 and @xmath429 but also through @xmath130 we divide equation ( b4 ) by the regular function @xmath431 and integrate over the small region @xmath432 . after integrating by parts",
    "the left hand side gives :    @xmath433(u-1)\\big\\}^{1+\\epsilon}_{1-\\epsilon}{\\nonumber}\\\\ -\\big[(u^{2}-1)p_{l}'(u)h\\big]^{1+\\epsilon}_{1-\\epsilon } & & { \\nonumber}\\\\ -l(l+1)\\int^{1+\\epsilon}_{1-\\epsilon}(u-1)p_{l}'(u)hdu\\big)p_{l}(\\mu ) & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath147 stands for @xmath434 so it is @xmath435 when @xmath436 and zero when @xmath437 and its derivatives are zero at both places .",
    "the first term reduces to @xmath438 and the second to @xmath439 and the third reduces to the same integral without the @xmath147 but with the lower limit replaced by @xmath435 .",
    "it is clearly @xmath440 .",
    "thus the whole expression is @xmath441 and there is no @xmath442 function discontinuity in the equation at @xmath130 .",
    "it is interesting to remark that had we divided equation ( b4 ) by @xmath443 before integrating we have found the result      which equals @xmath445 , so the equation when divided by @xmath443 does have a @xmath442 function discontinuity between the two sides at @xmath130 ! it is only the extra factor @xmath446 that saves the situation above .",
    "the derivation of equation ( b2 ) from maxwell s equations does not involve any multiplication by @xmath447 .",
    "having demonstrated that our solution      is a solution everywhere we recall that our starting equations are independent of the zero point of time so an explosion that starts at @xmath449 will be described by setting @xmath450 rather than @xmath451 . also , since our equations are the linear maxwell equations , we can superpose solutions to obtain ,      if @xmath420 satisfies maxwell s equations @xmath453 , will too .",
    "the physics of this is that the explosion takes a finite time of order @xmath156 and occurs in a finite volume of order @xmath454 so we need to average the fields generated by a point explosion over radial distances @xmath455 .        where we used the fact that @xmath462 satisfies legendre s equation .",
    "now when the step in the heaviside function in equation ( b8 ) is at later times than those involved in the integral in ( b9 ) we replace h by unity .",
    "so provided @xmath463 we perform the integral in ( b9 ) and find      however when @xmath465 the heaviside function cuts into the range of integration in ( b9 ) .",
    "if we multiply equation ( b10 ) by @xmath434 we then find that the range of integration has its upper limit changed from @xmath466 to @xmath467 .",
    "to evaluate @xmath453 we need the three integrals            as a further check we took @xmath109 and showed that this expression for @xmath453 does indeed obey equation ( a13 ) which itself follows directly from maxwell s equations",
    ". thus our procedure of finding singular self - similar solutions and then averaging out the singularities is indeed giving non - singular solutions of maxwell s equations even in the region over which the singularity is smoothed out .",
    "of course in the new region ( iii ) @xmath475 there is no signal and @xmath453 is zero . remembering that @xmath476 we see that @xmath453 is given by    @xmath477p_{l}'(u_{0})p_{l}(\\mu ) & u_{0}-1 > \\frac{c\\tau_{0}}{2r}\\\\ \\{[(u_{0}^{2}-1)i_{0}+\\frac{1}{2}l(l+1)i_{2}]p_{l}'(u_{0})+ & \\\\ + l(l+1)i_{1}p_{l}(u_{0})\\}p_{l}(\\mu ) & |u_{0}-1|\\leq \\frac{c\\tau_{0}}{2r } \\\\ 0 & u_{0}-1<-\\frac{c\\tau_{0}}{2r}. \\end{array } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is easy to see that @xmath453 is continuous as @xmath478 at the edges of region ( ii ) , so @xmath479 and @xmath480 go from 1 and @xmath481 at the inner edge of region ( ii ) , to zero at the outer edge and @xmath482 is zero at both edges .",
    "such a continuity is actually inevitable since even the unsmoothed @xmath483 is continuous since @xmath484 is continuous but furthermore the first derivative of @xmath420 includes a heaviside function discontinuity .",
    "the result of smoothing in @xmath117 ensures that the @xmath485 is continuous but @xmath486 may have a heaviside function corresponding to finite sudden changes in field strength at the edges of region ( ii ) .",
    "even such jumps would be avoided had we used the gentler function @xmath487 with @xmath488 in the range @xmath489 to @xmath490 in place of the simpler function @xmath491 used above .",
    "the more complicated function has zero first derivatives at both ends of the range and would lead to continuous and differentiable field strengths everywhere but we felt that the much more complicated expression for the @xmath492 added unnecessary complexity .",
    "we notice that when @xmath156 is small , the smoothing produced a negligible modification of order @xmath493 in region ( i ) . in region ( ii )",
    "the changes are significant in that the @xmath442 function fields are removed and spread out over a region @xmath494 around @xmath51 .",
    "the @xmath482 term is especially significant here , despite its falling to zero at the inner and outer edges of this region ."
