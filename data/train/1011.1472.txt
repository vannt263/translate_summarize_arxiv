    ". it would be interesting to explore ways to include these data in a dispersion analysis with more general parametrizations of the imaginary part .    the new application of the timelike pion form factor described here once more underscores the importance of analyticity in relating observables measured in different kinematic regions",
    ". it would be helpful if phenomenological parametrizations of the form factors such as @xcite employed a framework which strictly respects analyticity , e.g.  by using analytic functions like the gs form , or by parametrizing only the spectral strength on the physical cut and generating the real part by a dispersion integral .",
