    "rare @xmath0 decays induced by flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) play important roles in particle physics , where they are always regarded as ideal places for probing signals of new physics .",
    "the gim suppression of fcnc amplitude is absent in many new physics scenarios beyond the standard model ( sm ) , which could give large enhancement of fcnc contributions over the sm predictions .",
    "however , due to our poor knowledge of non - perturbative qcd , predictions for many interesting exclusive decays are polluted by large hadronic uncertainties .",
    "therefore , it would be of great interest to explore rare @xmath0 decays , which are induced with few hadronic parameters as well as only by fcnc currents .",
    "two body radiative @xmath0 decays involve simple hadronic dynamics with only one hadron in the final states , so they suffer much less pollution than non - leptonic decays .    in studying",
    "the radiative decays such as @xmath12 , @xmath13 , the isospin breaking effects between the charged @xmath14 and neutral @xmath15 in these modes are mainly from the annihilation type diagrams @xcite .",
    "many of pure annihilation type radiative decays , such as @xmath16 and @xmath17 , have been analyzed in the qcd factorization approach @xcite and in the perturbative qcd approach @xcite .",
    "we find the branching ratio of @xmath18 is at the order of @xmath19 in the sm .",
    "the decay rate is too small to be observed at presently running @xmath0 factories , babar and belle .",
    "any measurements of the decays at babar and belle would be direct evidences of new physics . in this work",
    ", we explore the decay @xmath16 and similarly the decay @xmath20 in the non - universal @xmath7 model @xcite , which could be naturally derived in certain string constructions @xcite , e6 models @xcite and so on . generally speaking , within the such model",
    "a flavor mixing can be induced at the tree level in the up - type and/or down - type quark sector after diagonalizing their mass matrices . in some new physics model , fcncs due to @xmath7 exchange",
    "can be induced by mixing among the sm quarks and the exotic quarks , which have been predicted to have different @xmath7 quantum numbers . here",
    "we will consider the model in which the interaction between the @xmath7 boson and fermions are flavor non - universal for left handed couplings and flavor diagonal for right handed couplings .",
    "the effects of the @xmath7 on other processes of the interest have been investigated in a number of papers such as @xcite , especially in @xmath0 physics @xcite .",
    "the recent review about @xmath7 in detail is referred to ref .",
    "@xcite .    to keep completeness ,",
    "we first calculate these decays in the naive factorization approach .",
    "then we add the vertex corrections to the four quark operators , which have been performed in the so called qcd factorization approach @xcite in the sm , utilizing the light - cone wave functions of the light vector mesons .",
    "a similar work within the r - parity violating susy can be also found in ref .",
    ". however , in this work we will revisit these processes with the updated parameters in the non - universal @xmath7 model .",
