    "the structure of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is a fertile area for the testing of cosmological models , but the elimination of foreground effects due to processes in the galaxy , particularly in the halo , is not a trivial problem .",
    "the processes relate mainly to photons due to cosmic ray ( cr ) electrons and radiation from dust .",
    "the frequency used in the cmb maps ( @xcite hereafter referred to as the wmap ) is that for which the foreground contributions are a minimum .",
    "it is interesting to note @xcite that at this frequency the sum of the components gives almost the 2.7 k temperature spectral shape . in our recent publication ( @xcite ) , which confirmed results reported by us about ten years ago ( @xcite ) with the one - year only wmap data , @xcite , we have shown that there is strong evidence that the procedure of eliminating the known and identified foreground contributions is not perfect .",
    "we have found some contributions from large galactic structures which have not been taken into account yet .",
    "the method we used was based on the correlation of the explicit cosmic ray origin effects measured by the egret satellite @xcite , i.e. the gamma ray flux , and the cmb temperature characteristics .    in the present work we are still using the egret gamma ray measurement but comparing the high energy photon flux with the polarization characteristics of the microwave radiation registered by the wmap experiment .",
    "some remarks are necessary about the sources of the data .",
    "although the cmb temperature maps used earlier were cleaned of foreground , to the best degree available , by the authors , those for polarization  as published  have not been .",
    "there is thus an inevitable foreground contribution .",
    "turning to the gamma ray map , the egret measurements have been superseded by the fermi - lat data .",
    "however , a comparison of the two sky maps shows that they are very similar .",
    "the features in the maps which are relevant to the present analysis relate largely to the distribution of cr - target material , which is in the form of atomic and ( lumpy ) molecular hydrogen .",
    "it is the interaction of cr with the gas which produces the measured gamma rays .",
    "our hypothesis regarding the cmb foreground is that some , at least , will be due to cr - heated dust and electron synchrotron radiation , both of which are only indirectly connected with the gas .",
    "thus , and in order to preserve continuity with previous work , we continue to adopt the egret maps .",
    "the sky map of cmb temperature fluctuations has been analysed in many different ways .",
    "the most important and significant is the search for the cosmological structures observed against the background of random noise . on the other hand",
    "the observed sky map at any frequency of the electromagnetic spectrum has obvious structures related to the galactic shadow or to galactic sources .",
    "these structures make a foreground on the cmb sky and we need to identify them and then extract them . for the temperature maps the process of the foreground reduction gives the set of `` cleaned '' maps , which contains to a great extent the real cosmological cmb structures , but the process of cleaning is not obvious and there could be different strategies leading to slightly different results .",
    "this is a source of systematics in the further analysis of the cmb data and in turn the source of uncertainties in the resulting cosmological parameters . for the polarization case",
    "the vector character of the data makes the cleaning procedure much more complicated .",
    "in addition , the small degree of polarization makes the flux under consideration much harder to determine experimentally .",
    "all this is probably the reason that the set of polarization data of wmap available to the public do not contain the cleaned maps with any known cleaning procedure .",
    "the analysis of the wmap polarization data shows a strong enhancement of the intensity of radiation close to the galactic disk as would be expected for all foregrounds .",
    "the same structure is seen for the gamma ray flux in the egret map .",
    "we supposed that the egret map ( with point sources excluded ) is a view of the possible foreground on cmb maps caused by the cosmic rays and galactic matter structures .",
    "the correlation between the egret gamma ray flux and the temperature fluctuations measured in this direction by wmap was used in our previous papers @xcite .",
    "we have followed this way of constructing the sky map of the respective correlation coefficients for the polarization parameters of wmap .",
    "the polarization is measured as a set of stoke s parameters ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) . for each point ( pixel ) in the sky the number of independent observations is also given .",
    "the statistics ( exposure ) of different parts of the sky is not uniform and there are patterns relevant to the detector structures and measurement technique as mentioned already in @xcite.this is a factor which contributes slightly to the reported average values of polarization . the polarization intensity , @xmath2",
    ", even if there is a completely random polarized light registered , is defined as the square root of @xmath3 , and has non - zero average values .",
    "the square of @xmath2 fluctuates as the sum of the squares of two randomly distributed quantities .",
    "each value of @xmath0 and @xmath1 is the average value of a number of measurements , so it should in principle obey a normal , gaussian , distributions with width proportional to the square root of the measurement number .",
    "all stokes parameter values ( @xmath2 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) measured by wmap depend on how long each fragment of the sky was observed .",
    "this is very important when one is looking for the small structures of polarized cmb . in the present paper , however , we concentrate on big and very big structures , as were the ones we found in the temperature fluctuation analysis .    to diminish the effect of random fluctuations we used the technique of the running average thereby smoothing the small scale effects .",
    "the smoothing of the wmap polarization parameter maps was done by calculating the value of each parameter for each point on the high resolution wmap , averaging all the points within a cone of radius 10@xmath4 weighted with the exponential weight : @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "such smoothed @xmath1 and @xmath0 maps were used to derive the polarization intensity @xmath2 and the polarization angle we define the angle with respect to the n - s direction : value 0 represents the n - s direction and 90@xmath4 is for the w - e direction .",
    "is the w - e direction .",

    "the maps are obtained using the software of the healpix @xcite package .",
    "[ fig1],title=\"fig:\",width=464 ]    the procedure of running average was used to smooth the wmap data for all frequency bands .",
    "further analysis has been performed for each band separately , but also we add the fluxes of q , v and w bands to produce a less fluctuating picture .",
    "the results and conclusions do not change using the sum , so below we present some details only for this case .",
    "the input maps are given in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the polarization map shows the emission from the galactic disk , which is not excluded from the data sets .",
    "there is also visible the equatorial plane which could be partially an effect of the statistics discussed above .",
    "the angle map does not contain these well defined and understood structures , but in general the angle map could be misleading . at every point the value of",
    "is obtained whatever the values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 are , however small is the total polarization flux itself . due to the uncertainties of the measurement for small values of @xmath0 and",
    "@xmath1 the polarization direction is highly undetermined ( small fluctuations of @xmath1 around the value of 0 from a positive to negative value change abruptly the direction from n - s to w - e ) .",
    "the maps for the angle should therefore be used with great care .    ,",

    "the correlation with gamma ray intensity was calculated as a linear correlation coefficient for all point in the neighbourhood of the pixel defined as the directions in the sky within the cone of radius of 10@xmath4 .    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the egret gamma ray flux and @xmath8 - the polarization or the polarization angle towards the point @xmath9 .",
