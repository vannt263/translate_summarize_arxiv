    "heegaard floer homology was introduced by ozsvth and szab in @xcite,@xcite , and proved to be a powerful 3-manifold invariant .",
    "the construction of the invariant requires an admissibility condition though , which in general is not met by those `` simplest '' heegaard diagrams for a given 3-manifold @xmath1 with @xmath2 .",
    "a variant of the construction using novikov ring overcomes this shortcoming , and in some sense embraces the ordinary homology as a special case .",
    "the invariants , usually called _ perturbed _ heegaard floer homology , proved to be useful in some situations . for example , jabuka and mark made use of them in calculating ozsvth - szab invariants for certain closed 4-manifolds @xcite .",
    "this paper is aimed to compute the perturbed heegaard floer homologies for product three manifolds @xmath3 .",
    "the result is a little bit surprising as we find that the homology groups are independent of the exact direction of perturbations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we review the backgrounds of novikov ring @xmath4 and the perturbed heegaard floer homology . treating homology groups as @xmath4-vector spaces , we prove a rank inequality and an euler characteristic identity . in section 3 , we write down a special heegaard diagram for @xmath5 , and compute its perturbed heegaard floer homology .",
    "very similar argument can be applied to arbitrary torus bundles . in section 4 ,",
    "we compute the homology for nontorsion spin@xmath6 structure of @xmath0 .",
    "i would like to thank my advisor , zoltn szab , for suggesting me the problem and having many helpful discussions at various points .",
    "i am also grateful to yinghua ai , joshua greene and yi ni for conversations about this work .",
    "in ozsvth and szab @xcite , they sketch a variant of heegaard floer homologies analogous to the perturbed version of seiberg - witten floer homology . for the construction ,",
    "we work over the _ novikov ring _ @xmath4 ( which is in fact a field ) consisting of formal power series @xmath7 , for which @xmath8 and @xmath9 for any @xmath10 , endowed with the multiplication law : @xmath11    for a pointed heegaard diagram @xmath12 for @xmath1 , define the boundary map @xmath13 by @xmath14=\\sum_{y } ( \\sum_{\\{\\phi\\in \\pi_2(x , y ) | n_z(\\phi)\\leq i\\ } } \\#\\widehat{\\mathcal{m}}(\\phi ) t^{\\mathcal{a}(\\phi)}\\cdot [ y , i - n_z(\\phi)]),\\ ] ] where @xmath15 denotes the area of the domain @xmath16 .",
    "this construction depends on the area of each periodic domain , which can be thought of as a real two - dimensional cohomology class @xmath17 . and",
    "it is shown that the corresponding homology groups , denoted by @xmath18 , are invariants of the underlying topological data only .",
    "it is a natural question to ask for an explicit dependence of @xmath19 on @xmath20 .",
    "we are not quite achieving this yet , but our result provides a bound for the rank of @xmath21 as a vector space over @xmath4 .",
    "more precisely , it is bounded by @xmath22 and @xmath23 for two very special cohomology class @xmath24 $ ] and @xmath25 $ ] , where @xmath24 $ ] is a _ generic _ class in the sense that @xmath26 for any integral periodic domain @xmath27 ; and @xmath28 is a _ trivial _ class , i.e. @xmath29 for any periodic domain @xmath27 .

    "the rank of @xmath30 over @xmath4 is the same as the rank of the ordinary unperturbed @xmath31 over @xmath32 .",
    "the rank of @xmath22 over @xmath4 is the same as the rank of the non - torsion part of the completely twisted @xmath33)$ ] over the ring @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "3 .   in general",
    ", we have a rank inequality : @xmath35    the proof is based on the following simple fact from linear algebra :    [ l1 ] the rank of a matrix @xmath36 is the largest integer @xmath37 such that there exists some @xmath38 minor of @xmath36 with non - zero determinant .    note",
    "that lemma [ l1 ] provides us an algorithm to compute the rank of homology : choose a basis for the vector space @xmath39 , and write the boundary map @xmath13 in a matrix form @xmath36 . by definition , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , so @xmath42    in other words , in order to find the rank of @xmath43 , it suffices to find the rank of @xmath36 , which in turn is completely determined by the determinants of all its minors .",
    "both @xmath4 and @xmath44 $ ] consist of formal power series as their elements - this is a special property we are going to employ in deciding if a determinant is zero .",
    "more specifically , for a matrix @xmath45)$ ] , @xmath46 being a formal sum , terms ca nt be added unless their exponents are equal . hence , @xmath47 iff we can pair all the terms in the summand and cancel each other out .",
    "more formally , we find @xmath48 pairs , where within each pair of permutations @xmath49 and @xmath50 we have @xmath51 , or equivalently :    @xmath52    in general , entries of @xmath36 do nt have to be monomials like @xmath53 ; some entries could be like @xmath54 and some might even vanish .",
    "these happen when there are more than two holomorphic disks or no disk connecting two generators at all . nonetheless , we are still able to write the determinants as sums of the products of entries , and whether @xmath55 or not still depends on the existence of the pairing aforementioned .",
    "while finding exactly the pairing could be difficult , we will only apply the following simple philosophy:``the more terms in the summand are equal , the more likely the sum is zero . ''",
    "this philosophy is only valid in those fields with characteristic 2 and whose elements are formal sums . fortunately",
    ", that is so for @xmath4 and @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "fix an admissible diagram for @xmath1 , and find all generators @xmath56 .",

    "hence , by assumption , @xmath78 , @xmath79 when @xmath70 , while @xmath80 may or may not be zero .",
    "in other words , when we write @xmath81 as a formal sum , all terms are identical . for @xmath82 ,",
    "none of them are identical unless they are identical in @xmath62 already in the first place . for a general @xmath64 , the bigger the kernel of @xmath20 is , the more terms in the summand are equal .",
    "therefore , @xmath83 implies @xmath65 and @xmath65 implies @xmath84 ; but not the other way around .",
    "apply lemma [ l1 ] , we obtain part ( 3 ) of our proposition .",
    "when @xmath70 , @xmath85 , so @xmath82 equals zero iff @xmath62 equals zero .",
    "this implies @xmath86 , proving part ( 2 ) .",
    "since all terms in @xmath81 are identical , we may replace all @xmath87 by 1 , and denote the corresponding matrix by @xmath88 . then , @xmath84 iff @xmath89 , so @xmath90 .",
    "observe that @xmath88 corresponds to the boundary map for the ordinary unperturbed @xmath91 , this proves part ( 1 ) .",
    "it is implied in the course of the proof that @xmath92 does in fact depend only on the intersection @xmath93 of all integral periodic domains .",
    "this is a fact that we will repeatedly use throughout the paper .",
    "similar results hold for @xmath94 in a non - torsion spin@xmath6 structure @xmath95 :    [ main prop+ ]    1 .   when @xmath95 is a non - torsion spin@xmath6 structure , @xmath96 is finitely generated , and the euler characteristic @xmath97 where @xmath98 is turaev s torsion function , with respect to the component @xmath99 of @xmath100 containing @xmath101 .",
