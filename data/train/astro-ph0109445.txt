    "observations of high redshift clusters are valuable to test our current understanding of structure formation on cosmological scales ( e.g. eke , cole & frenk 1996 ; bahcall & fan 1998 )",
    ". in particular reliable mass estimates of these systems are important , as they provide strong constraints on cosmological models .",
    "the small , systematic , distortion in the shapes of background sources induced by massive structures , known as weak gravitational lensing , has proven to be a powerful method to measure the masses of clusters of galaxies ( for an extensive review see mellier 1999 ) .",
    "the weak lensing effect allows one to reconstruct the projected surface mass density ( e.g. kaiser & squires 1993 ) or measure the mass , without having to rely on assumptions about the state or nature of the deflecting matter .",
    "however , for an accurate mass estimate high number densities of background galaxies are needed , as well as a good estimate of their redshift distribution .",
    "lensing studies of high redshift clusters @xmath11 are difficult because the lensing signal is low and most of the signal comes from small , faint sources",
    ". these sources typically have sizes which are comparable to the size of the psf in ground based images . to extract the lensing signal from such observations large corrections are required .",
    "for these studies hst observations have great advantage over ground based observations because the background sources are much better resolved , resulting in a well calibrated weak lensing signal .",
    "in this paper we present the results of our weak lensing analysis of the @xmath12 cluster of galaxies ms  2053 - 04 .",
    "it is the third cluster of which we studied the mass distribution based on a deep two - colour mosaic of wfpc2 images .",
    "the other two clusters that have been studied this way are cl  1358 + 62 @xmath13 ( hoekstra et al . 1998 ; hfks hereafter ) , and ms  1054 - 03 @xmath14 ( hoekstra , franx , & kuijken 2000 ; hfk hereafter ) .",
    "all three clusters have been selected on the basis of their strong x - ray emission .",
    "ms  2053 was detected in the einstein medium sensitivity survey ( gioia & luppino 1994 ) .",
    "it is one of the few @xmath15 clusters found in this survey , and of these high redshift clusters it has the lowest x - ray luminosity .",
    "its x - ray luminosity is @xmath16 ergs / s ( henry 2000 ) .",
    "the x - ray temperature measured by bepposax is @xmath17 kev ( della ceca et al . 2000 ) .",
    "a more accurate temperature of @xmath18 kev has been determined from asca observations ( henry 2000 ) .",
    "luppino & gioia ( 1992 ) discovered a gravitationally lensed arc in deep images of ms  2053 .",
    "the arc is located approximately 15 arcseconds from the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) .",
    "its redshift is still unknown .",
    "the cluster mass distribution has been studied previously through weak lensing by clowe ( 1998 ) based on deep ground based images .",
    "we first present the results of the weak lensing analysis of ms  2053 . in section  2",
    "we briefly discuss the data , and in section  3 the object analysis is described .",
    "the cluster light distribution is examined in section  4 . in section  5",
    "we present the weak lensing signal and the reconstruction of the projected surface mass density .",
    "the mass and mass - to - light ratio inferred from our analysis are presented in section  6 . in section  7",
    "we present the combined results of a sample of 4 clusters that have analysed and calibrated in a uniform way .",
    "we compare the weak lensing mass estimates to dynamical estimates .",
    "we also study the average mass profile of the clusters , as well as their mass - to - light ratios .",
    "to study the cluster ms  2053 we use a mosaic of wfpc2 images taken with the hubble space telescope .",
    "figure  [ layout ] shows the layout of the mosaic constructed from the 6 pointings of the telescope .",
    "the cluster has been observed in two passbands .",
    "each pointing in each filter consists of three separate short exposures , which allows an effective rejection of cosmic rays .",
    "the total integration time per pointing was 3300s in the @xmath19 filter , and 3200s in the @xmath20 filter .",
    "the reduction is described in van dokkum et al .",
    "for the weak lensing analysis we omit the data of the planetary camera because the data do not reach the same depth as the wide field camera .",
    "the total area covered by the observations is approximately 26.5 arcmin@xmath21 .",
    "the weak lensing analysis technique is based on that developed by kaiser , squires , & broadhurst ( 1995 ) , and luppino & kaiser ( 1997 ) , with a number of modifications which are described in detail in hfks and hfk .",
    "we analyse each wfpc2 chip separately , and combine the object catalogs to a master catalog once all objects have been analysed and the appropriate corrections have been applied .",
    "we use the hierarchical peak finding algorithm from kaiser et al .",
    "( 1995 ) to find objects with a significance @xmath22 over the local sky .",
    "these are analysed , which yields estimates for their sizes , magnitudes and shapes .",
    "as described in hfk we also estimate the error on the shape measurements , which allows a proper weighting of the sources .",
    "the resulting catalogs are inspected visually , and spurious detections , such as diffraction spikes , hii regions in resolved galaxies , etc .",
    "are removed .",
    "we then identify the objects that are detected in both the @xmath19 and @xmath23 images .",
    "for these we determine colours using the same aperture for both filters .",
    "the aperture that is used scales with the gaussian scale length @xmath24 of the object .",
    "this results in a sample of 2155 objects , both galaxies and stars , with a corresponding number density of 81 objects arcmin@xmath25 .",
    "the objects that are detected in only one filter are small , and faint , and as a result not useful for the weak lensing analysis .",
    "the magnitudes are zero - pointed to vega , using the zero points given the _ hst _ data handbook ( voit et al .",
    "figure  [ sizemag ] shows the plot of the apparent magnitude versus the object half light radius of the detected objects .    because of the low galactic latitude of ms  2053 many stars are found in the observed field .",
    "these are located in the vertical sequence of points at a half - light radius @xmath26 .",
    "the brightest stars saturate and have larger half light radii . based on figure  [ sizemag ]",
    "we select a sample of 198 moderately bright stars .",
    "these stars are used to study the psf , and the results are used to correct the shapes of the faint galaxies for psf anisotropy and the size of the psf as described in hfks .",
    "the observed polarizations in the @xmath20 images of these stars are presented in figure  [ psf ] .",
    "hfks studied the wfpc2 psf using observations of the globular cluster m4 , and the pattern observed here is similar to the one presented in hfks .",
    "the psf changes slightly with time , and subtraction of the m4 model from the observations leaves systematic residuals . to improve the model for the psf anisotropy we fitted a modified model to the shape parameters of the stars in the ms  2053 .",
    "it is a scaled version of the m4 model with a first order polynomial added : @xmath27 this model fits the observed psf anisotropy of stars in the ms  2053 field well ( the reduced @xmath28 of the fit is 0.98 for 179 stars ) .    the next step is to determine the `` pre - seeing '' shear polarizability @xmath29 ( luppino & kaiser 1997 ; hfks ) .",
    "the measurements of @xmath29 for individual galaxies are rather noisy , and therefore we bin the measurements as a function of the gaussian scale length @xmath24 .    because of the poor sampling of wfpc2 images only the shapes of galaxies with size @xmath30 can be corrected reliably that is a factor @xmath31 too large .",
    "this affects all objects , and therefore the limit listed here corresponds to the 0 given by hfks . ] .",
    "we select objects that have @xmath32 and remove saturated stars from the catalogs . after this selection the sample of galaxies consists of 1540 galaxies analysed from the @xmath19 images , and 1545 from the @xmath20 images .",
    "we note that because of this cut not all objects appear in both catalogs anymore .    finally the shapes are corrected for the camera distortion , and the catalogs",
    "are combined into a master catalog .",
    "we use the estimated errors on the shape measurements to combine the results from the @xmath19 and @xmath20 images in an optimal way .",
    "the resulting catalog includes 1677 galaxies , which corresponds to a number density of 63 galaxies arcmin@xmath25 .",
    "figure  [ colmag]a shows the colour of the galaxies in the full mosaic versus their @xmath20 magnitude . compared to the other two clusters for which we obtained hst mosaics , ms",
    "2053 is less obvious from the optical images . as a result",
    "the contrast of the cluster colour - magnitude relation with the background is lower .",
    "however , in the diagram for galaxies within 1 arminute from the bcg the cluster colour - magnitude relation can be discerned ( fig .",
    "[ colmag]b ) .    to estimate the light contents of the cluster we define a sample of cluster galaxies as follows . down to @xmath33",
    "we select spectroscopically confirmed cluster members ( van dokkum et al .",
    "2001 , in preparation ) . at fainter magnitudes we use the colour - magnitude relation drawn in figure  [ colmag]b .",
    "we select galaxies with @xmath34 mag relative to the cluster colour - magnitude relation . to correct for contamination by field galaxies",
    "we subtract the counts from the hubble deep fields north and south . the smoothed luminosity distribution of this sample is presented in figure  [ lumdis]a . in figures",
    "[ lumdis]b and c grey scale images of the smoothed number density of bright @xmath35 and faint @xmath36 galaxies are presented . around the position of the bcg",
    "a significant overdensity of galaxies is detected .",
    "figure  [ lumdis]a shows most clearly that the light distribution is elongated in the direction where the arc is found ( luppino & gioia 1992 ) . figure  [ lumdis]c still shows an overdensity at the position of the cluster .",
    "interestingly , it also shows a clear overdensity south of the cluster .",
    "the overdensity is caused by galaxies bluer than the cluster , but it is not clear whether they belong to another cluster along the line of sight .",
    "we estimate the cluster luminosity in the rest frame @xmath37 band . to do",
    "so we use template spectra for a range in spectral types and compute the corresponding pass band correction ( this procedure is similar to the method described in van dokkum & franx 1996 ) .",
    "thus we find the following transformation from the hst filters to the rest frame @xmath37 band : @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the corrected @xmath37 band magnitude .",
    "the luminosity is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the solar absolute @xmath37 magnitude , @xmath42 is the distance modulus , and @xmath43 is the extinction correction in the @xmath20 filter towards ms  2053 .",
    "the redshift of @xmath12 for ms  2053 gives a distance modulus of @xmath44 .",
    "we use the dust maps from schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) to correct for the galactic extinction .",
    "because of the low galactic latitude of ms  2053 , we find a rather high value of @xmath45 .",
    "we have used sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) to determine total magnitudes for the galaxies .",
    "the cumulative light profile as a function of distance from the cluster centre is presented in figure  [ lumprof ] .",
    "the total luminosity within an aperture of radius @xmath5 mpc is @xmath46 .",
    "the error in the luminosity reflects the uncertainty in the determination of cluster membership , and the total magnitudes measured by sextractor .",
    "we note , however , that the error is small compared to the uncertainty in the weak lensing signal ( section  4 and further ) . at large radii",
    "the profile is rather steep . to compute the profile , we average the light distribution in circular bins .",
    "if the light distribution is elongated as suggested by figure  [ lumdis]a this leads to an overestimate of the light at large radii , where the coverage is incomplete .",
    "each galaxy gives only a noisy estimate of the weak lensing signal because of its intrinsic shape .",
    "therefore we average the shape measurements of many sources to obtain a useful estimate of the distortion @xmath47 .",
    "when we compute the ensemble averaged distortion , we weight the contribution of each object with the inverse square of the uncertainty in the measurement of the distortion as described in hfk .",
    "we select galaxies with @xmath48 , and @xmath49 in our sample of background galaxies .",
    "as mentioned above , we exclude objects with sizes comparable to the psf .",
    "the resulting sample consists of 1130 galaxies , and has a median magnitude of @xmath50 . comparison with figure  [ colmag ] shows that some faint cluster members might end up in this sample of background sources",
    ". the contamination will be most important in the central region of the cluster . to estimate the contamination by cluster members we examined the azimuthally averaged number density as a function of distance from the cluster centre .",
    "the profile is presented in figure  [ profbg ] .",
    "the number counts are slightly higher near the cluster centre , but the excess is not significant . in the further analysis we ignore the data inside 40  from the bcg .",
    "the average number density of sources is 43 galaxies arcmin@xmath25 .",
    "similar number densities can be reached in deep images taken from the ground ( e.g. , bzecourt et al . 2000 ) . however , the main advantage of our observations over ground based images is the much smaller correction for the size of the psf . as a result",
    "the lensing signal is better calibrated , and the noise in the shape measurements from hst data is lower .    figure  [ massrec]a shows the smoothed distortion field from the sample of source galaxies ( we used a gaussian with a fwhm of @xmath51 ) .",
    "the position of the bcg corresponds to the origin of the plot . a systematic tangential alignment of the sources with respect to the cluster centre can be observed .",
    "we use the distortion field presented in figure  [ massrec]a to reconstruct the projected surface mass density .",
    "the mass reconstruction has been computed using the maximum likelihood extension of the original ks algorithm ( kaiser & squires 1993 ; squires & kaiser 1996 ) .",
    "this algorithm has the advantage over direct inversion methods that it can be applied to fields with complicated boundaries , such as our mosaic .",
    "figure  [ massrec]b shows a grey scale image of the reconstructed surface mass density .",
    "the peak in the mass distribution coincides with the position of the bcg .",
    "a bootstrapping resampling of the shape measurements enables us to compute the noise map of the mass reconstruction , which is presented in figure  [ massrec]c .",
    "the noise in the mass reconstruction increases rapidly towards the edges of the observed field . from the noise map",
    "we find that the peak in the mass distribution is detected at the @xmath52 level .",
    "the azimuthally averaged tangential distortion @xmath53 as a function of radius from the cluster centre is a useful measure of the lensing signal ( e.g. , miralda - escud 1991 ; tyson & fischer 1995 ) . the tangential distortion is defined as @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the azimuthal angle with respect to the assumed cluster centre , for which we take the position of the bcg .    the azimuthally averaged tangential distortion as a function of radius from the cluster centre is presented in figure  [ gtprof ] . a singular isothermal sphere model ( @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the einstein radius ) gives a best fitted @xmath58 . to minimize the diluting effect of cluster galaxies on the weak lensing signal , we have excluded the measurements at radii smaller than 40  from the fit .",
    "the next step is to relate the measurement of the einstein radius to a velocity dispersion , for which we use photometric redshift distribution from the the northern and southern hubble deep fields ( fernndez - soto , lanzetta , & yahil 1999 ; chen et al .",
    "hfk examined the usefulness of photometric redshift distributions to calibrate the lensing signal and found that they work well .",
    "the amplitude of the lensing signal as a function of source redshift is characterized by @xmath59 , which is defined as @xmath60 $ ] , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the angular diameter distances between the lens and the source , and the observer and the source . to compute @xmath63 we also take into account that fainter galaxies are noisier and have a lower weight in the average . for our sample of sources",
    "we obtain @xmath64 ( taking @xmath65 , and @xmath66 ) . placing the background galaxies in a single source plane at @xmath67 would yield a similar @xmath63 . using these results",
    "we derive a velocity dispersion of @xmath68 km / s .",
    "the value of @xmath63 does not only depend on the redshifts of the sources , but it also depends on the cosmological parameters that define the angular diameter distances . for an @xmath69 , and @xmath66 model",
    "we find essentially the same @xmath63 , and @xmath70 km / s . in a @xmath71 dominated universe",
    "the changes are larger . assuming @xmath65 , and @xmath72 gives @xmath73 , and results in @xmath74 km / s .",
    "the result from the weak lensing analysis is in excellent agreement with the observed velocity dispersion of @xmath4 km / s , which was determined from the velocities of 52 cluster members ( van dokkum et al .",
    "2001 , in preparation ) .",
    "clowe ( 1998 ) obtained deep @xmath75 band images of ms  2053 with the keck telescope , and measured the weak lensing signal .",
    "he used a source redshift of @xmath76 and derived a velocity dispersion of @xmath77 km / s .",
    "such high average source redshifts are unrealistic , in particular when compared to the @xmath67 we use , based on photometric redshift distributions . for more realistic redshift distributions",
    "the result of clowe ( 1998 ) increases to @xmath78 km / s , in good agreement with our results .",
    "luppino & gioia ( 1992 ) discovered a gravitationally lensed blue arc in deep images of ms  2053 .",
    "the arc is located approximately 15 arcseconds north of the bcg . to date , the redshift of the arc is not known .",
    "if we assume a redshift of @xmath79 for the arc , and adopt a sis model ( where the position of the arc gives the eistein radius ) the corresponding velocity dispersion is about 1030 km / s .",
    "this value is higher than , but consistent with the weak lensing estimate .",
    "moreover , if the mass distribution is elongated in the direction of the arc the strong lensing mass estimate is lowered .",
    "figure  [ lumdis]a indicates that the light distribution is elongated , roughly in the direction of the giant arc . because of the low signal - to - noise ratio of the weak lensing signal , we can not constrain the elongation of the mass distribution .      from the sample of cluster galaxies we estimate a total cluster luminosity of @xmath80 within an aperture of radius @xmath5 mpc ( see section  4 ) .",
    "the best fit sis model gives a projected mass of @xmath81 in the same aperture .",
    "thus we obtain an average mass - to - light ratio of @xmath6 within @xmath5 mpc .",
    "kelson et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have studied the fundamental plane of ms  2053 .",
    "they find that the early type galaxies in the cluster define a clear fundamental plane .",
    "comparison with low redshift clusters suggests that the structure of early type galaxies has changed little since @xmath12 .",
    "similar analyses have been performed for other clusters ( e.g. van dokkum & franx 1996 ; van dokkum et al .",
    "1998 ) and have shown that the mass - to - light ratios of early type galaxies evolve with redshift , which is accounted to luminosity evolution .    as a result also the global cluster mass - to - light ratios evolve with redshift .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio of early type galaxies in ms  2053 in the @xmath37 band is @xmath82 lower than present day values ( kelson et al .",
    "1997 ) . under the assumption that the total luminosity of the cluster has changed by the same amount ,",
    "we find an average mass - to - light within @xmath5 mpc of @xmath8 , corrected for luminosity evolution to @xmath7 .",
    "the first contribution to the error budget is the statistical uncertainty in the determination of the mass - to - light ratio , and the second contribution is due to the uncertainty in the correction for luminosity evolution .    under the assumption that the light traces the mass we can derive the expected tangential distortion as a function of radius . to measure the mass - to - light ratio , we scale the computed tangential distortion @xmath83 to match the observed signal . in figure",
    "[ moverl]a the resulting profile ( solid line ) is shown .",
    "the ratio of the computed and observed signal is presented in figure  [ moverl]b .",
    "because of possible contamination by faint cluster members we exclude the points at radii less than 40  from the fit .",
    "we find that the results are consistent with a constant mass - to - light ratio with radius , and we find an average value of @xmath84 .",
