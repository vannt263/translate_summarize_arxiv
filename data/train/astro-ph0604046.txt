    "our _ chandra_/hetgs observation of 4u  1916@xmath005 revealed narrow , unresolved absorption lines in the persistent emission , attributable to hydrogenic neon , magnesium , silicon , and sulfur , in addition to the previous identified hydrogenic and helium - like iron absorption lines .",
    "this makes 4u  1916@xmath005 only the second of the classical x - ray dipper systems to show narrow absorption lines from mid-@xmath35 elements ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the properties of these lines is of particular interest for understanding the emission and absorption processes . with a 50  min orbital period ,",
    "4u  1916@xmath005 is the shortest period x - ray dipper , and as such should have the smallest accretion disk .",
    "if the lines are associated with the accretion disk , they should have widths comparable to the expected keplerian velocities in the disk . assuming a 1.42.0 @xmath36 primary and a 0.10.15 @xmath36 secondary ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we can estimate the outer disk velocity assuming that the disk fills 70% of the primary roche lobe .",
    "we find that the outer disk velocity should be in the range of 10001300  km  s@xmath2 , while the companion velocity should be 740840  km  s@xmath2 . in all cases ,",
    "the measured line widths are consistent with , or below , the instrument resolution . for and , the upper limits on the line widths are less than the estimated outer disk velocity .",
    "additionally , we measure no shift in the wavelength of the lines , ruling out a strong outflow .",
    "the line shows a slight shift ( @xmath170.004   ) but given that this is the least significant of our line detections and the possibility of systematic errors , we do not feel it is a significant result .",
    "we suggest two possible explanations for these results .",
    "first , the absorber could be static , producing the narrow lines and lack of wavelengths shifts .",
    "this however seems unlikely given the large quantities of angular momentum present in the system .",
    "instead , we propose that the line properties are a measure of the emission properties , particularly the extent of the emission . in this case , we assume that the ionized absorber is associated with either the accretion disk or its atmosphere , as suggested by the implied cylindrical geometry ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the rotation of the absorbing material is only measurable when it has a component along the line of sight to the emitter .",
    "if the bulk velocity is perpendicular to the line of sight , no velocity effects will be found in the absorption lines ( excluding thermal or turbulent motions which we take as small compared to the keplerian velocities in the disk ) . from the limits on the linewidths , we can calculate the maximum allowable radial extent of the emitter .",
    "we find that the x - ray emission region is @xmath37  km , assuming that the absorber is located at the outer edge of the accretion disk .",
    "this represents the maximum upper limit on the extent .",
    "we note that if the absorber is located at a smaller disk radius , the upper limit will be smaller , roughly 1/4 of the absorber radius .",
    "assuming that photoionization is the dominant ionization process for the absorbing material , we can estimate the ionization parameter , @xmath38 @xcite , from the ratio of the helium - like to hydrogenic column densities for each atomic species .",
    "we assume that the helium - like and hydrogenic ions are present at the same , single - valued ionization parameter .",
    "this is a simple approximation to the expected true state of the system in which the ions exist in different relative proportions over a range of ionization parameters .",
    "we used xstar to estimate the ion abundances as a function of @xmath39 for an optically thin plasma , with constant number density and solar abundances .",
    "we note that while the companion in 4u  1916@xmath005 is expected to be a hydrogen - deficient star , and solar abundances would therefore not apply , we found that varying the abundances made no significant difference in the helium - like to hydrogenic column density ratios for any element .",
    "the only xstar input that made a substantial difference in the inferred ionization parameters was the shape of the input spectrum .",
    "we tried three models , a power law with @xmath40 , a 10  kev bremsstrahlung , and a user defined model based on the continuum emission of 4u  1916@xmath005 .",
    "we compared the xstar results with the column density ratios for neon , magnesium , silicon , sulfur , and iron as given in table  [ tab : line ] .",
    "we note that these values are only valid if the lines are unsaturated .",
    "the limits for neon and magnesium are too high to provide any constraint on the ionization parameter . for silicon",
    ", we find @xmath411.72.0 and for sulfur , @xmath423.3 , given the error in the measurement and the variation in @xmath39 with spectral model ( highest values for the power law model , lower for the bremsstrahlung and user defined models ) .",
    "the most constraining result comes of course from the iron ratio , where we find @xmath43 3.50@xmath160.13 for the bremsstrahlung model , 3.73@xmath160.13 for the power law model , and 3.02@xmath160.12 for the user defined model .",
    "this rough estimate would suggest that the iron absorption is found in a material with higher ionization than the lower @xmath35 elements . our result is consistent with modeling of the ionized absorber in mxb  1658@xmath0298 which required a distribution of ionization parameters",
    "this is of course expected since in a material ionized enough to contain helium - like and hydrogenic iron , the lower @xmath35 elements would be completely stripped .",
