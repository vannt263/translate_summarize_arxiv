    "in treatment planning ( tp ) of radiotherapy , a patient body is commonly modeled to be h@xmath0o of variable effective density , which corresponds to electron density for high - energy photons or stopping - power ratio for charged particles .",
    "the effective density is normally converted from computed - tomography ( ct ) number for attenuation of kilovoltage ( kv ) x ray .",
    "the standard approach to construct such conversion functions involves experimental modeling of the x ray and stoichiometric analysis of body tissues.@xcite the effective density is , though practically successful,@xcite an approximate concept for radiations undergoing complex interactions .    with the advancement of computer technology , monte carlo ( mc ) simulation of radiotherapy is becoming feasible , where a radiation is handled as a collection of particles individually interacting with matter of known composition according to the basic laws of physics . for the modeling of body tissues , schneider , bortfeld , and schlegel ( sbs ) applied the stoichiometric calibration to construct functions to convert ct number to mass density and elemental weights.@xcite their conversion functions , though commonly used for research,@xcite are not applicable to the other ct systems .",
    "calibration and maintenance of the complex one - to - many relations may prevent mc simulation from applying to tp practice .    for patient dose calculation , tp systems commonly use a selectable function to convert ct number to effective density of interest .",
    "recently , a practical two - step approach was proposed for tp with proton and ion beams,@xcite where ct number is only converted to electron density that is automatically converted to interaction - specific effective densities using invariant relations . in the present study",
    ", we extend the two - step approach to promote mc - based tp practice .",
    "we used the standard body tissue data in icrp publication 110,@xcite which is the latest compilation of the kind . in the publication",
    "are mass density @xmath1 and elemental weights @xmath2 for 53 standard tissues that fully comprise 141 organs of reference male and female , for which we derived electron density @xmath3 and mass fraction @xmath4 per person ( 50% male/50% female ) .",
    "ignoring tiny mass of air , below 0.90 g/@xmath5 was only a lung at 0.384 g/@xmath5 occupying 1.4% of body mass , which we chose for elemental composition of air - containing tissues . in the 0.901.00 g/@xmath5 region",
    "were an adipose tissue at 0.95 g/@xmath5 ( 33.9% ) and medullary cavities including bone marrow all at 0.98 g/@xmath5 ( 0.4% ) . in the 1.001.07 g/@xmath5 region",
    "were a muscle at 1.05 g/@xmath5 ( 34.5% ) , spongiosa tissues ( 0.3% ) , and many other general organs ( 11.7% ) . in the 1.071.101 g/@xmath5 region were a skin ( 4.9% ) , a cartilage ( 0.6% ) , and spongiosa tissues ( 0.7% ) , which are miscellaneously epithelium , connective , and fatty bone tissues . in the 1.1011.25 g/@xmath5 region were only spongiosa tissues ( 5.7% ) .",
    "above 1.25 g/@xmath5 were a mineral bone at 1.92 g/@xmath5 ( 5.7% ) and a tooth at 2.75 g/@xmath5 ( 0.1% ) .    among the material properties , we adopted mass density @xmath1 as the independent variable and examined its correlation to the dependent variables : electron density @xmath3 and elemental densities @xmath6 of six major elements",
    "@xmath7 = \\{h , c , n , o , p , ca}. to define the regional representative tissues , we took mass - weighted mean for the set of densities @xmath8 over tissue @xmath9 in region @xmath10 by @xmath11 for the standard tissues and the regional representative tissues , we calculated the residual weight and the mean residual atomic number by adding weights and averaging atomic number @xmath12 over residual element @xmath13 , @xmath14 with which the residual mass could be approximately included in mc simulation .",
    "compared to muscle / organ tissues , adipose / marrow tissues have high concentration of fat .",
    "teeth have high concentration of minerals , connective tissues have high concentration of collagen , and bones are in between them .",
    "the concentration varies among and within individual tissues and are generally correlated with density .",
    "anatomically , adipose tissues are neighboring to muscles and organs , muscles are connected to bones via connective tissues , and teeth are connected to jaw bones . at these interfaces ,",
    "tissue mixing may occur in an image of finite spatial resolution .",
    "therefore , we modeled an arbitrary tissue of mass density @xmath1 to be mixture of representative tissues 1 and 2 that comprise a density segment of @xmath15 .",
    "the other densities are interpolated from those of the representative tissues by @xmath16 in a mass - weighting manner.@xcite in other words , we assigned the representative tissues to the polyline points for conversion from mass density to the other densities .    for fatty tissues lighter than the representative adipose / marrow tissue , we extended the soft - tissue region down to 0.90 g/@xmath5 , which is the mass density of human fat at 37@xmath17c.@xcite similarly , we extended the region for air - containing tissues up to 0.80 g/@xmath5 , leaving a transition segment of 0.800.90 g/@xmath5 to avoid discontinuity of the material properties and to cope with body fat that escape over the segment boundary as viewed in ct image .",
    "we also extended the hard - tissue region up to 3.00 g/@xmath5 for teeth heavier than their representative . to define the extended boundaries",
    ", we applied eq .",
    "[ eq:3 ] for extrapolation although , for the fat , the n , p , and ca weights were forced to zero and the c weight was adjusted to sum up to 100% to comply with general composition of fatty acid . for the polyline tissues , we compiled mass fraction , mass and electron densities , elemental and residual weights , and mean residual atomic number .",
