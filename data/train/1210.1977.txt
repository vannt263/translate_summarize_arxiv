    "in the classical parameter estimation theory a fundamental role is played by the cramer - rao inequality . according to the latter",
    "the variance - covariance of an unbiased estimator is bounded from below by the inverse of the classical fisher information matrix , which is constructed from the logarithmic derivatives of the parametric statistical model .",
    "the fisher information matrix provides a metric on the information manifold of the probability distributions of the model .",
    "a basic property of such a metric on a statistical manifold is its monotonicity under stochastic ( information loosing ) transformations .",
    "this means that the distributions are closer w.r.t . such metrics or become less distinguishable under such transformations . the well known theorem of cencov @xcite states that the classical fisher metric is the unique metric with the above monotonicity property .",
    "in the quantum parameter estimation problem there are new aspects in the parameter estimation inequalities .",
    "first a parameter of a quantum state is estimated using appropriate quantum measurements which provide classical probability distributions .",
    "these distributions give the classical fisher metrics with corresponding cramer - rao inequalities .",
    "second the question of the existence of metrics which are independent of the measurements and characteristic only of the quantum states is related to the existence of quantum fisher metrics with the monotonicity property under completely positive maps of the states .",
    "the theorem of cencov - morozova - petz @xcite gives the general form of all monotone metrics .",
    "with respect to these metrics there is a hierarchy of cramer - rao type inequalities which provide bounds for the variance - covariance of unbiased estimators .",
    "while the highest bound is given by the classical fisher metric of the measurement probability , the quantum monotone metrics give lower bounds @xcite .",
    "the highest among them is given by the symmetric logarithmic derivative ( sld ) and the lowest by the right logarithmic derivative ( rld ) .",
    "there is an extensive literature on the saturation of these inequalities for finite ensembles and in the asymptotic regime @xcite .",
    "we posed a question in the opposite direction .",
    "while the saturation of the inequalities can not be achieved for all measurements and all types of quantum states , we asked whether there exist higher bounds for a class of measurements that give a less informative estimation .",
    "this would be useful in classifying the effectiveness of certain measurements which may actually be realized .",
    "existence of higher bounds means less accuracy in parameter estimation for certain measurements .",
    "given the fact that the sld gives the highest bound which , anyway , is smaller than the classical fisher bound , a higher bound , in the spirit of quantum metrics , can be derived if one goes outside the family of metrics resulting from the cencov - morozova - petz theorem .",
    "since the non - uniqueness of the quantum information metrics is related to the non - commutativity of the logarithmic derivatives , it seemed natural to construct logarithmic derivatives indirectly through a phase - space correspondence .",
    "that is , for the given quantum state , we took the logarithmic derivatives of the corresponding husimi function and mapped them back as operators in the original hilbert space . using these operator valued objects we derived a metric",
    "but , as expected , at least for the case of one qubit , the form is not that of the petz family of metrics .",
    "this means that our metric is not manifestly monotone .",
    "nevertheless we investigated what could be its role in the hierarchy of cramer - rao type inequalities .",
    "we introduced a function which in some sense quantifies the deviation of the new metric from the sld metric . using this function we proved that there exist measurements for which the mean square error is bounded from below , with a bound even higher than the classical fisher bound .",
    "this result could be useful in the investigation of the effectiveness of certain estimation procedures .",
    "+ in the paper we first give a short introduction on the classical and quantum estimation problems with the corresponding inequalities .",
    "then we present the necessary tools for the phase - space correspondence .",
    "next we construct the new logarithmic derivatives and the new quantum metric . using this we state a theorem concerning the new bound and",
    "apply it to an example of one qubit .",
    "the proof is given in the appendix .",
    "finally we discuss open problems and further possibilities of this approach .",
    "here we present only the necessary concepts in order to establish the notation .",
    "we refer to the bibliography for the details @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0\\in \\xi\\}\\ ] ] be a parametric family of probability distributions on @xmath1 .",
    "this is an n - dimensional parametric statistical model @xcite .",
    "given the n observations @xmath2 , the classical estimation problem concerns the statistical methods that may be used to detect the true distribution , that is to estimate the parameters @xmath3 .",
    "to this purpose , an appropriate estimator is used for each parameter .",
    "these estimators are maps from the parameter space to the space of the random variables of the model .",
    "the quality of the estimation is measured by the variance -covariance matrix @xmath4 $ ] where @xmath5\\ ] ] suppose that the estimators are unbiased , namely @xmath6=\\xi \\quad   \\quad \\forall \\xi \\in \\xi\\ ] ] then a lower bound for the estimation error is given by the cramer - rao inequality @xmath7 where @xmath8 $ ] @xmath9\\ ] ] the classical fisher matrix with @xmath10 the score function . as it has been shown",
    "the fisher matrix provides a metric on the manifold of classical probability distributions .",
    "this metric , according to the theorem of chencov @xcite , is the unique metric which is monotone under the transformations of the statistical model .",
    "this means that if the map @xmath11 induces a model @xmath12 on @xmath13 then @xmath14 that is , the distance of the transformed distributions is smaller than that of the original distributions .",
    "thus monotonicity of the metric is intuitively related to the fact that in general we loose distinguishability of the distributions after applying any transformation to the information .",
    "+ the case of quantum estimation problem differs in two fundamental aspects from the classical one .",
    "first the parameters to be estimated are classical parameters of the apparatuses that prepare the quantum system to a given state .",
    "these parameters are measured through an interaction of the system with appropriate measuring devices .",
    "the measurements give classical distributions which must be estimated as in the classical case , and thus the estimation errors obey the corresponding cramer - rao inequalities .",
    "the efficiency of this procedure depends on the effectiveness of the measurements used .",
    "the immediate question is what is the ultimate bound for the estimation error .",
    "this bound must depend only on the state of the system and as it turned out it is given by the inverse of a quantity termed quantum fisher information metric @xcite .",
    "let @xmath15 be the measurements used to estimate the state @xmath16 of the system .",
    "then the probability distribution of the measurements is @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "the corresponding classical fisher information metric @xmath18 satisfies the inequality @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the quantum fisher information metric of @xcite , while the index _ s _ means _ symmetric _ and indicates the way this metric is constructed , that is the way the logarithmic derivative is generalized to an appropriate operator .",
    "more specifically this operator valued quantity is defined implicitly by the equation    @xmath21    and then @xmath20 is defined by the equation    @xmath22    from now on we write @xmath23 as @xmath24 denoting that it is constructed through a _",
    "symmetric logarithmic derivative_. the sld metric is monotone under completely positive maps , but it is not unique .",
    "this fact is the second fundamental difference from the classical case .",
    "there are various approaches for the definition and construction of quantum fisher information metrics @xcite .",
    "the cencov - morozova - petz theorem @xcite gives a general characterization of monotone metrics using operator monotone functions @xcite .",
    "for these metrics we have the inequalities    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is any monotone metric and @xmath27 is the metric corresponding to the _",
    "_ r__ight logarithmic derivative defined as @xmath28 for the case of one qubit that we analyze here , the monotone metrics have the general form @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 satisfies @xmath32 .",
    "the above inequalities satisfied by the quantum information metrics lead to the conclusion that , as far as the estimation problem is concerned , only the sld metric has any practical use , though there are some cases where other metrics play a role @xcite .",
    "a great part of the literature on the estimation problem deals with the question of saturation of these inequalities mainly in the asymptotic case @xcite . in the present work",
    "we pose a question in the opposite direction .",
    "we ask whether there exit measurements for which there is a higher bound in the estimation error . in the sequel , after introducing our phase - space construction of the logarithmic derivatives , we prove the existence of such measurements with a higher lower bound even higher than that of the classical fisher metric of the corresponding measurement .",
    "+ since our interest is on the question of the existence of measurements with higher lower bounds of estimation errors , we restrict our analysis to the one qubit case",
    ". then the hilbert space is 2-dimensional and the information manifold 3d @xcite .",
    "the state of one qubit is given by the density operator @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 with @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "explicitly we have @xmath39 @xmath40 are the coordinates of the information manifold for the qubit .",
    "the dynamical symmetry group for the system is @xmath41 and the phase space is the unit sphere @xmath42 .",
    "let @xmath43 be a point on @xmath44 .",
    "the weyl rule @xmath45\\ ] ] is a map of an operator a acting on the hilbert space to a function on the phase space .",
    "@xmath46 is a parametric family of operators defined on the phase space , and called stratonovich - weyl kernels @xcite .",
    "the inverse map is @xmath47 where here @xmath48 .",

    "for @xmath54 we get the husimi q - function , which is non - negative and thus a probability distribution .",
    "we have @xmath55\\\\=\\frac{1}{2}(1+rcos\\theta_{1}cos\\theta+rcos(\\phi_{1}-\\phi)sin\\theta_{1}sin\\theta)\\ ] ] + now having a genuine probability distribution associated directly to the state of the system , and not specific to a measurement , we may construct a fisher metric .",
    "@xmath56\\ ] ]    this was proposed as a way to avoid the non - commutativity difficulties of the direct hilbert space constructions @xcite . in @xcite a classical fisher metric",
    "was constructed for a squeezed state . as it turned out , this metric was proportional to the sld one . in @xcite using this phase space approach a metric was given in the form @xmath57 this metric is manifestly non - monotone , as it differs from the standard form of the monotone metrics @xcite .",
    "the conclusion is that , though the construction of the classical fisher metric through the phase - space distribution is very natural , it turned out that either it gives no new metric , or it gives one manifestly outside the monotone family . motivated by these results we looked at an alternative route , that of a construction of quantum logarithmic derivatives through the phace - space correspondence .",
    "+ we propose the following equally natural construction : starting from the quantum state , construct the phase - space distribution ( husimi function ) and take partial derivatives with respect to the relevant parameters of the model .",
    "these are functions on the phase - space . then using the stratonovich - weyl kernels map these functions back to hilbert space operators .",
    "finally use these operators to construct , in the standard way , the quantum fisher metric .",
    "we present our results for the one qubit case .",
    "+ we have for the new operator logarithmic derivative @xmath58 we get @xmath59    @xmath60    @xmath61    from these we have @xmath62 this is our new quantum fisher metric , which is manifestly non - monotone . using this metric",
    "we construct a new bound for the estimation error which for some measurements is even higher than that of the corresponding classical fisher bound .",
    "+ we introduce three operators which quantify the deviation of our new metric from the sld metric @xmath63    @xmath64    @xmath65    @xmath66    these operators are involved in the construction of the bound . here",
    "we define the main quantities and present the main results .",
    "the detailed proof of the theorem is presented in the appendix .",
    "we suppose that we approximately know the value of the parameter @xmath3 , with an error @xmath67 and that , to be general , the povm measurement depends on @xmath68 i.e. @xmath69 , where @xmath70",
    ". then the classical probability distribution to be estimated is @xmath71 $ ] we assume that the estimation is unbiased , namely @xmath72 let @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",

    "+ then we have @xmath81    the proof can be found in the appendix .",
    "it is based on a similar theorem of @xcite .",
    "+ the above inequality is general , and it holds for an arbitrary measurement .",
    "the crucial point is that it depends on the operators h which depend only on the state , and not on the measurement .",
    "this means that for a given state we may extremize w.r.t .",
    "the measurements in order to uncover a possible new lower bound for a class of measurements . since the general case is quite involved , and since our purpose is to show that there exist such bounds , we analyze in the next section the case of one unknown parameter .      for the one qubit case the parameters are @xmath82 .",
    "considering @xmath83 to be the single unknown parameter the theorem states that @xmath84 where @xmath85 @xmath86 a general povm in the present case has the form @xmath87 then we get @xmath88 where @xmath89 we note that the quantity inside the absolute value , according to the proof of the theorem 1 , is real .",
    "now for measurements independent of the estimated parameter we can state the result as a corollary    let the measurement be independent of the estimated parameter @xmath83 , then since @xmath90 and @xmath91 the inequality simplifies to @xmath92    we observe that the bound concerns a family of estimators with the same nondiagonal elements .",
    "we want to maximize the right hand side of the inequality .",
    "this means to find conditions on a class of measurements that maximize the quantity @xmath93 our purpose is to prove the existence of measurements for which the bound is higher than that of the classical fisher metric .",
    "we impose conditions which the measurements must satisfy and which make them to have a very restricted form .",
    "this is only to prove our point , that is to prove that the class of measurements for which there exists a higher bound is not empty .",
    "a better approach would be to determine the most general form which has the property of being bounded with this higher bound .",
    "the non - negativity of the povm gives the non - negativity of its eigenvalues , namely @xmath94 the unbiasedness condition of eq 33 with its lhs changed to @xmath95 is @xmath96 where we have made the following general assumptions and specific choices for the matrix elements of the povm @xmath97",
    "@xmath98 @xmath99 we assume further that @xmath100 , as a function of @xmath101 is symmetric w.r.t . @xmath102 .",
    "then if we choose @xmath103 the condition given by eq 51 is satisfied and we also have @xmath104 then the quantity to be bounded becomes @xmath105 with the given assumptions and special conditions a bound for c comes from the nonnegativity of the eigenvalue @xmath106 . we get @xmath107 assuming further that @xmath108 @xmath109    we have @xmath110^{2}\\ ] ] where @xmath111 @xmath112 thus for the selected class of measurements we have a lower bound for the variance of the estimator which is different from that given by the sld .",
    "the usefulness of this result is that this bound , for this class of povms is higher than not only the bound provided by sld , which is higher than all those provided by the monotone metrics , but it is higher even from the bound of the corresponding classical fisher metric , as it is shown in the next section .      to make the bound explicit we choose the form of @xmath113 so that an analytic integration is possible .",
    "we take @xmath114 and @xmath115 from eq 58 considered as equality , and with the appropriate signs . with this choice",
    "we get @xmath90 and @xmath116 for the classical fisher metric for the measurement we have @xmath117    where @xmath118\\ ] ]    now in order to plot the different bounds we have chosen a value for @xmath83 so that @xmath119 and @xmath120 . in figure 1",
    "we plot @xmath121 and the corresponding quantities @xmath122 for sld , rld and the classical fisher metric versus the parameter r , which is related to the puriness of the state .",
    "we see that the new bound is higher than all the others .",
    "the deviation becomes bigger for higher values of r.     +",
    "we have posed the question whether , for certain classes of quantum estimators the lower bound for the variance of the estimated parameter is higher than those given by the quantum cramer - rao inequalities .",
    "the current literature deals with questions of saturation of these inequalities , that is which measurements are optimal with respect to their accuracy of estimation .",
    "here we asked whether there exist `` bad '' measurements for which the error is bounded from bellow with higher bounds .",
    "this would be useful in the classification of measurements with respect to their effectiveness .",
    "the highest possible bound given by the monotone quantum metrics is that of the symmetric logarithmic derivative .",
    "this is majorized by the classical fisher bound associated with the probability distribution of the measurement . to go beyond these bounds means to construct a metric outside the family of manifestly monotone metrics . to do that we constructed the operator logarithmic derivatives indirectly through the phase space correspondence .",
    "that is we mapped the state to the husimi function , we took the logarithmic derivative and we mapped them back to hilbert space operators .",
    "the related metric is manifestly not monotone . then using an operator which quantifies the difference of this derivative from the symmetric one we were able to derive a bound for the variance",
    "this depends both on the state and on the measurement .",
    "we were not able to determine the general class of the measurements for which the new bound is higher than the previous ones , but using an explicit example we showed that this class is not empty . now observing that , under the conditions we have imposed on the measurement , we have",
    "that one of its eigenvalues is zero , namely @xmath123 , we see that the measurement belongs to the class of sharp measurements @xcite .",
    "further work is needed to determine the class of all measurements which have this property of bounded accuracy and , most importantly , to analyze the physical realizability and nature of such measurements .",
    "the proof is based on similar techniques used in @xcite . first the unbiasedness condition is @xmath124 taking the derivative w.r.t .",
