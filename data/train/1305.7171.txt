    "<S> most of the electrons that do not cross the tilted junction are redirected towards the source by the edges . </S>",
    "<S> these electrons , especially the secondary modes , are rejected by the initial collimator and tend to build up in the central wedge . </S>",

    "<S> [ onoff ] plus additional edge scattering based leakage pathways ( a model was presented in @xcite including a specularity parameter @xmath73 ) . in summary , by manipuilating the angle dependent chiral tunneling of gpnj with patterned gates alone , we can controllably suppress klein tunneling and create a transmission gap as opposed to a structural band - gap . </S>",
    "<S> this is accomplished by combining the angular filtering at a split junction with the experimentally demonstrated chiral tunneling across tilted junctions , such that the transmission lobes across multiple junctions become orthogonal to each other in the off state . </S>",
    "<S> since the on state simply requires changing the polarity of the central gate while sticking with otherwise pristine gapless graphene , the on current stays very high . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , making the second junction abrupt renders its critical angle and thereby the overall transmission gap highly gate tunable , yielding a subthermal low - voltage turn - on that beats the landauer switching limit . </S>",
