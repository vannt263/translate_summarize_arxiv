    "in the following , we formulate a one - electron microcanonical distribution for triatomic molecules . we denote the positions of the nuclei by @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 and the inter - nuclear distances by @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , see fig .",
    "one can show that the coordinates of the nucleus c are expressed in terms of the inter - nuclear distances as follows :        we denote the position vector of the electron by @xmath8 and the distances of the electron from nuclei a , b and c by @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",

    "note that the energy is given by @xmath25 . the electron momentum in terms of the confocal elliptical coordinates",
    "is expressed as follows          the @xmath36 distribution goes to zero and is thus well - behaved when the electron is placed on top of either nucleus a or b. however , when @xmath37 , i.e. , the electron is placed on top of nucleus c , @xmath38 .",
    "we eliminate this singularity by introducing an additional transformation . setting @xmath39 , @xmath40 and expanding @xmath41 around @xmath42",
    "we find @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively , when the electron is placed on top of the nucleus c. to eliminate the singularity in eq .",

    "the new distribution takes the form      since @xmath16}$ ] , @xmath49 and @xmath46 take both negative and positive values and therefore , if we choose one @xmath50 for all values of @xmath13 , @xmath50 must be odd .",
    "moreover , to avoid the singularity when the electron is placed on top of nucleus c , @xmath50 must be such that @xmath51 , i.e. , @xmath52 . combining the above two conditions , yields @xmath53 .",

    "we consider the @xmath78 triatomic molecule in its ground state , where the distance of the nuclei in the equilateral triangle arrangement is 1.65 a.u . and",

    "we find the ionization potentials and equilibrium distances of the initial state using molpro , which is a quantum chemistry package @xcite .",
    "for the microcanonical distribution the relevant ionization energy is @xmath81 , since @xmath82 is associated with the electron that tunnel - ionizes in the initial state .      in fig .",
