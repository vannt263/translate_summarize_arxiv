    "the tau lepton is the heaviest of the leptons , and provides a unique opportunity to study low energy qcd and the mechanism of hadronization . with the shut - down of both the b - factory collaborations , babar @xcite and belle @xcite ,",
    "this is a critical time to make the results from more than a decade of experimental research available in a useful manner to high energy physics community before the opportunity is lost . to accomplish this , interaction between experimentalist and theorists is required to determine the optimal way for comparing experimental data with the theoretical prediction .",
    "the approach used by this work is to compare theory to data by using a monte carlo event generator to simulate the theoretical models .",
    "the monte carlo event generator tauola is a long term project that started in the 90 s with the publication @xcite .",
    "the generator simulates more than twenty modes , including both the leptonic and hadronic modes . modeling the hadronic decay modes",
    "involves matrix elements that convey the hadronization of the vector and axial - vector currents . at present",
    "there is no determination from first principles for those matrix elements since they involve strong interaction effects in the non - perturbative regime .",
    "therefore , one has to rely on models that parameterize the form - factors originating from the hadronization .",
    "the hadronic currents implemented in the generator tauola @xcite were based on theoretical results presented in @xcite .    in these models ,",
    "the hadronic form - factors are written as a weighted sum of products of breit - wigner functions .",
    "this approximation , as it is demonstrated in @xcite , is not able to reproduce the next - to - leading - order @xmath1pt results .",
    "later the experimental collaborations , both cleo @xcite and aleph @xcite , introduced improvements based on the result of their data analysis and in some cases spoiling the theoretical constraints .",
    "data the cleo collaboration @xcite introduced two ad - hoc parameters and , as a result , the wess - zumino part does not reproduce the qcd normalization . ] as an alternative , it was proposed to apply the methods of the resonance chiral theory @xcite .",
    "this approach is a better theoretically founded than the approach of weighted products of breit - wigner functions .",
    "however , it requires comparison both babar and belle experimental data with the results from theoretical models which have to be implemented into tauola . in the next sections",
    ", we will present the result on the implementation the rcht hadronic currents for @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 modes in tauola , for details see @xcite .",
    "for any two meson @xmath7 decay channel , the most general form of hadronic currents ( @xmath8 ) , which is compatible with lorentz invariance , is written as @xmath9 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the momenta of hadrons , @xmath12 , @xmath13 . for a final state of three pseudoscalarsis @xmath14 + c_4",

    "@xmath20 , @xmath21 , corresponding to the axial - vector part of the hadronic currents , only two are model - independent . for our convenience",
    "we keep all of them in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fivef ] ) .    the model - dependence in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : twomes ] ) and ( [ eq : fivef ] ) is included in the hadronic form - factors ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 expressed in terms of @xmath24 , i = 1 ... 5 ) . for three meson decay modes",
    ", the hadronic form - factors calculated within r@xmath1 t can be written as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the chiral contribution , @xmath27 is the one resonance contribution and @xmath28 is the double - resonance part .",
    "the explicit form of the functions @xmath24 for 3@xmath0 and @xmath29 modes can be found in @xcite , section 2 , and in @xcite .",
    "the corresponding theoretical form - factors are obtained in the isospin limit ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) , except for the two pion and two kaons modes .",
    "to avoid problems with multi - dimensional integration of the @xmath32-meson propagator , which is rapidly - changing as a function of its arguments , we first tabulated the @xmath33 of eq .",
    "( 38 ) of @xcite",
    ". then we use linear interpolation to obtain the value of the @xmath32 width at the required @xmath34 .    to check the numerical stability of the generator and the multiple numerical integration ,",
    "the following tests have been done :    * for every channel one dimensional spectrum @xmath35 ( for the three meson decay modes ) and @xmath36 ( for the two meson decay modes ) produced by the generator has been compared with the semi - analytical results .",
    "for the three meson decay modes the gauss integration method has been applied to integrate the analytical results for the hadronic currents .",
    "the results agree within statistical errors except for the first and last bins . *",
    "the spectrum obtained by the gauss integration has been compared with the linear interpolated spectrum from the neighboring points and demonstrated that the fluctuations due to numerical problems of integration are absent ; * the total rate for every channel obtained from a monte carlo run has been compared with the semi - analytical method and required to agree within statistical error .",
    "the results of comparison are presented in tab.[tab : bench ] .",
    "the tests have been performed in the isospin limit of meson masses , except for the two pion and two kaons modes . for more details about these tests",
    "see @xcite .",
    "triple gaussian integration is used for the analytical calculation and double gaussian integration is used for the current calculation that enters the matrix elements of the monte carlo generation .",
    "thus , a pre - tabulation of the @xmath32 width , @xmath33 , is a convenient tool to significantly increase the generation speed .",
    "[ cols=\">,^,^,^ \" , ]     currently , only the differential spectrum of the two pion modes @xcite and three pseudoscalar modes @xcite are published .",
    "we begin with a fit to the spectrum of the @xmath37 mode .",
    "the result is presented in table [ tab : fit ] and fig.[fig : fit ] .",
    "the fit was done taking into account only the dominant s - wave mechanism ( we follow the determination done in @xcite ) . as suggested in @xcite the discrepancy in the low mass region",
    "could be described adding a contribution from a scalar particle , @xmath38-wave mechanism .",
    "we expect that inclusion of the lowest - lying scalar resonance @xcite will improve the value of @xmath39 .",
    "the values in the 5th row of table [ tab : fit ] are only the preliminary results .",
    "they do not necessarily correspond to the minimum of @xmath40 of the final fit .",
    "work is in progress .",
    "some technical aspects of the fitting strategy is given in talk by z. was @xcite .",
    "from the perspective of high energy experiments , such as those at lhc , a good understanding of tau leptons properties contributes important ingredients of new physics signatures . with the discovery of a new particle around the mass of 125 - 126 gev @xcite , tau decays are an important decay mode for determining if this is the standard model higgs .",
    "this is especially pertinent since cms has reported a deficit in the number of fermion decays from the new particle relative to the standard model higgs prediction .    at lhc , at the moment , tau decays are only used for identification and are not used to study their dynamic .",
    "however , the dynamics of tau decays are important for both modeling the decays and therefore the reconstruction , identification and for measuring the polarization of tau decays . as a result ,",
    "an upgrade to the tauola based on the babar and belle measurements of tau decays is of some interest for systematic errors evaluation for lhc measurements .",
    "the theoretical results for the hadronic currents of two and three pseudoscalar modes , namely , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , in the framework of r@xmath1 t have been implemented in tauola .",
    "these modes , together with the one - meson decay modes , represent more than 88% of the hadronic width of the tau lepton .",
    "r@xmath1 t is a more controlled qcd - based model than the usually used breit - wigner parameterization .",
    "however , before making conclusion about validity of the model the theoretical results have to be confronted with the experimental data . this can be achieved by fitting the model to data . as a consequence of comparisons with the data ,",
    "some of the theoretical assumptions may need to be reconsidered too .",
    "now that the technical work on current installation is complete , the work on fitting the data is in progress in collaboration with theoreticians and experimentalists .",
    "therefore , we consider this work as a step towards a theoretically rigorous description of hadronic tau decay data .",
    "as soon as the theoretical results are able to reproduce babar and belle data for the most important for lhc decays into two and three pions the tauola - rcht version will be installed into lhc environment as it is described in @xcite .",
