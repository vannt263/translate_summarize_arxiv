    "the future space mission planck will be able to measure , with unprecedented angular resolution and sensitivity , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy and polarization at 9 frequencies in the range 30857 ghz . in combination with balloon ",
    "borne experiments such as boomerang , maxima-1 , tophat and the recently launched space mission map , these observational data will provide a unique base for investigation of the history and the large  scale structure formation of the universe .",
    "the accuracy of the cosmological parameter extraction planned for the planck mission is determined by the corresponding accuracy of the systematic effects .",
    "systematic errors can be one of the most important sources of errors for high multipole range of the @xmath0 power spectrum ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is well known that extraction of the information about cosmological parameters such as baryonic density @xmath1 , cold dark matter density @xmath2 , hubble constant @xmath3 , and so on , needs additional information about the statistical characteristics of the measured cmb anisotropy signal from the sky .",
    "the pure cmb signal is assumed to be a realization of a random gaussian signal on the sphere with power spectrum @xmath0 .",
    "the gaussianity of the cmb signal means that all its statistical properties are specified by its power spectrum @xmath0 , which depend on @xmath4 and not on the phases .    in the framework of the cmb observations",
    "the signal measured by different instruments at different frequencies , however , displays some peculiarities in observational as well as in foreground manifestations .",
    "this is why a variety of the methods of the correct information extraction from the cmb data sets are now under discussion .",
    "all these methods are somewhat complementary to each other in the future highly sensitive cmb experiments , due to different sensitivity of the methods to different characteristics of the signal .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", the power spectrum of the true cmb signal is independent of fourier rings , meaning that it does not depend on the azimuthal number @xmath5 . for a flat patch of the sky it corresponds to homogeneity and isotropy of the signal , without angular dependency of the power spectrum @xmath6 on @xmath7 , where @xmath8 . in reality , the cmb signal from the sky has a more complicated structure reflecting some artifacts of the observation and different kinds of foreground contaminations , which can destroy the isotropy of the power spectrum",
    ". we will focus on a few important sources causing artificial anisotropy of the map : ( i ) `` non - gaussianity '' ( inhomogeneity and anisotropy ) of the foregrounds in the map ; ( ii ) asymmetry of the beam shape , which is now the standard part of investigation on systematic effects ; ( iii ) correlations of the instrumental ( pixel ) noise ; ( iv ) low multipole modes , e.g. @xmath9 for the whole sky ( @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the linear size of the path of the sky ) , which are statistically peculiar .",
    "some of the above  mentioned sources of the @xmath0 anisotropies are frequency  dependent , thus their contributions to the maps at different frequency channels of the planck are different .",
    "for example , the foregrounds such as dust emission , synchrotron , free  free , as well as bright and faint point sources , have different frequency dependencies and intensities at 33 and 857 ghz range , which definitely can manifest as some sources of errors in the pixel  pixel window function and in the corresponding correlation function of the signals .",
    "the influence of the low multipole modes ( point ( iv ) ) on the possible anisotropies of the maps in the flat sky approximation can be detected directly from the corresponding @xmath6 amplitudes of the power spectrum .",
    "this paper is mainly devoted to illustration of the idea about manifestation and estimation of the asymmetric ( elliptical or more irregular ) beam shapes incorporated in the pixelized data , using both analysis of the two - dimensional spectrum and of phases of the map ( @xcite ) .",
    "we concentrate on beam asymmetry estimation using simulated cmb map , which reflects directly the specific of the planck scan strategy , map making and noise level .",
    "there are some important issues related to the beam profiles of the antenna for the planck low frequency instrument ( lfi ) and high frequency instrument ( hfi ) frequency channels ( @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , down to the level -10 db at lfi , the antenna shapes have approximately elliptical forms and peculiarities will only be included at higher multipoles if the level decreases down to -20 db or less , according to the design of the focal plane unit ( fpu ) .",
    "thus , roughly speaking , decentralization of the feed horns in the fpu produces the optical distortions of the beam shapes from the circular gaussian shapes(@xcite ) .",
    "beam shape influence on the accuracy of the cmb anisotropy @xmath0 extraction from the observational data is related to the scanning strategy and pixelization of the maps from the time - ordered data(tod)(@xcite ) . during scanning of the cmb sky",
    "the antenna beam moves across the sky , meaning that antenna beam is a function of time .",
    "after pixelization of the tod the position of each pixel in the cmb map is related directly with some points in the time stream for which we need to obtain the information of the orientation of the beam and location of the beam center relative to each pixel . in principle , given the scanning strategy ( which for the planck mission is under discussion ) and the beam shapes for each frequency channel , we would be able to model the geometrical properties of the pixel beam shapes and their manifestation in the pixel ",
    "pixel window functions incorporated in the cmb power spectrum @xmath0 .",
    "however , the computational cost would increase dramatically due to the complicated character of the pixel ",
    "pixel beam matrix(@xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the scanning strategy and the instrumental noise combined with the systematic effects could transform the actual beam shape during the time of observation .",
    "we then should find some peculiarities of the complicated beam shape influence on the cmb signal .    if the response of an antenna on the measured signal is linear and the cmb signal and the instrumental noise are gaussian and not correlated , then the information about the beam anisotropy obtaining by both methods ( power spectrum analysis and phase analysis ) is the same .",
    "however in the general case the sets of encoded information obtained by both methods are different . thus using both methods",
    "is desirable .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we give some definitions of cmb signals and discuss the basic model of the planck sky map . in section 3 we introduce a general power spectrum and phase analysis of cmb signal and the concept of beam  shape extraction . in section 4",
    "we describe the main idea and its analytical approach .",
    "the numerical results are presented in section 5 and the conclusion in section 6 .",
    "let us introduce the standard model of cmb experiment where tod contain the information about the signal ( and noise ) from a large numbers of the circular scans .",
    "we suppose for simplicity that all systematic errors are removed after a preliminary `` cleaning '' of the scans . in the temporal domain",
    "the observed signal @xmath12 is the combination of the cmb + foreground signal @xmath13 and random instrumental noise @xmath14 , @xmath15 where @xmath16 with @xmath17 being the multipole expansion of the time  stream beam @xmath18 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq2 ] ) @xmath19 is the corresponding multipole coefficient of the cmb + foreground signal expansion on the sphere and @xmath20 is the spherical harmonics .",
    "following tegmark ( 1996 ) we will assume that map  making algorithm is linear .",
    "the signal in each pixel @xmath21 is then @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the corresponding pointing matrix and @xmath21 represents the cmb plus foregrounds signals from the sky convolved by the pixel beam @xmath24 , @xmath25 @xmath26 is the instrumental noise in each pixel : @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the coefficient of the pixel noise expansion .",
    "@xmath29 is a two  dimensional vector with the components ( @xmath30 ) to denote the location on the surface of the sphere .",
    "the pointing matrix @xmath31 depends on the scanning strategy of the observation .",
    "below , as a basic model , we will use the model of the planck mission scanning strategy discussed by burigana et al .",
    "( 2000 ) with stable orientation of the spin axis in the ecliptic plane and without precession of the spin axis .",
    "any precession of the spin axis will cause additional ( regular ) spin  axis modulation .    instead of the fast rotating beam model described by wu et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , we will use a stable  orientationed beam model during sky crossing for the spin and optical axes , i.e. , during the rotation of the optical axis around the spin axis of the satellite , the orientation of the beam is stable with respect to the optical axis . in addition",
    "we will also assume that instrumental noise is non - correlated for a single time ",
    "ordered scan , and between scans as well .",
    "definitely this model of instrumental noise is primitive , and needs modifications and more detailed investigation , but it nevertheless reflects , as shown in the next section , the geometrical properties of asymmetry of the beam and their manifestation in the pixelized maps by a given scanning strategy . under the assumptions mentioned above we will use the elliptical beam shape model of burigana et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . for a small part of the flat sky approximation",
    ", we will use the cartesian coordinate system with the @xmath32 axis parallel to the scanning direction and @xmath33 axis perpendicular to it .",
    "we denote by @xmath34 and @xmath35 the position of the center of the beam at the moment @xmath36 .",

    "the @xmath42-matrix denotes the beam dispersion along the ellipse principal axis , expressed as @xmath43 as mentioned by wu et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , the signal in the time stream is not the pixel temperature in @xmath21 itself .",
    "the observed signal in each pixel @xmath44 depends on the orientation of the pixel beam @xmath45 and the location of its center . for a non - symmetric spatially dependent beam",
    ", the convolution of the signal with asymmetric beam immediately produces asymmetry coupled with the underlying signal , which affects the estimation of angular power spectrum . for beam shape above -20 db level , where the beam shape is elliptical , we will use the flat sky approximation in order to demonstrate how we can estimate the beam shape in the phases diagram .",
    "in such an approximation we can describe the signal and instrumental noise on some small area of the sky using fft method instead of time consuming spherical harmonic expansion .",
    "in addition we will use the stable pixelized beam orientation model for a small area of the sky to reflect the scanning strategy of the observation .",
    "under the assumption of complete sky coverage , the spherical harmonics @xmath46 can be expressed as a product of the legendre polynomials @xmath47 and the signal can be written as ( burigana et al , 1998 )    @xmath48 , \\label{eq : eq52}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath49 and @xmath50 we assume for simplicity the cobe - like cubic pixelization , which satisfies the following symmetry properties : if @xmath51 , then @xmath52 also , and if @xmath53 , then @xmath54 .",

    "however , as we mentioned in the introduction , in the general case these methods give different sets of information .",
    "for the phase analysis we will `` perturb '' the phases by adding controlled white noise into the map .",

    "at the end of this discussion we would like to give the following remark .",
    "for estimation of the asymmetry of the antenna beam shape using the controlled noise method , we need to know the limit of the beam cross - level ( in db ) , for which we can extract the peculiarities of the beam .",
