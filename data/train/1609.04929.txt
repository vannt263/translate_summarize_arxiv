    "so altogether we have shown that @xmath404 from lemma  [ lem_a ] and from equation ( i ) of lemma  [ lem_c_fritz ] it also follows that for all @xmath386 we have @xmath405 which tends to @xmath406 for @xmath386 to infinity .",

    "in the first part of this section we consider products          where @xmath410 is again an i.i.d .  sequence .",
    "thus we can apply kolmogorov s law of the iterated logarithm @xcite ( see also feller @xcite ) in the i.i.d .  case .",
    "however , for later use we state this lil in a more general form below .    [ lemma7 ] let @xmath411 be a sequence of independent random variables with expectations @xmath412 and finite variances @xmath413 , and let @xmath414 .",
    "assume there are positive numbers @xmath415 such that @xmath416 then @xmath417 satisfies a law of the iterated logarithm @xmath418        in order to apply lemma  [ lemma7 ] to the sum , we note that @xmath423 and compute the variance @xmath424 this proves theorem [ th51 ] .",

    "@xmath27 with bounded continued fraction expansion , by corollary  [ co_prodb ] we have      for the second sum in we set @xmath428 and apply lemma  [ lemma7 ] . the random variables @xmath429 are clearly independent and thus we have to compute the quantities @xmath430 and check condition . obviously , @xmath431 and @xmath432 .",
