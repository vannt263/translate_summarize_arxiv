    "one of the most debated aspects of the unification scheme for active galactic nuclei ( agns ) is the origin of the difference between radio - loud ( rl ) and radio - quiet ( rq ) objects .",
    "whether or not an agn is able to develop a large - scale jet must be somehow intimately related to the central engine , for example , to the spin of the black hole ( blandford & znajek 1977 ) .",
    "x - ray observations are particularly relevant to this issue , as x - rays are thought to arise mostly in the neighbourhood of the nucleus itself .",
    "it was noted early on ( wilkes & elvis 1987 , canizares & white 1989 ) that the x - ray spectra of rl agn are generally harder than those of rq agn .",
    "further , it was found that the circumnuclear environment of rl and rq agns appears different : rl agns are often surrounded by cold absorbing material ( see , e.g. , cappi et al .",
    "1997 , sambruna et al . 1999 ) while many rq agn exhibit x - ray warm absorber features ( reynolds & fabian 1995 ) .    the origin of the apparently flat x - ray spectrum of rl objects was attributed to beamed emission , which would dominate over , if at all present , the compton upscattering by relativistic electrons off the uv photons from the accretion disk in rq agn",
    ". the apparently flatter slope of the underlying unabsorbed spectrum in rl agn ( cappi et al . 1997 ) lent some support to this .",
    "however , more recent work by sambruna , eracleous & mushotzky ( 1999 ) demonstrates that the intrinsic power law ( once absorption is accounted for ) is very similar in rl objects with a double - lobe radio structure ( i.e. , not suspected of being beamed towards the observer ) and rq agn ( photon spectral index @xmath8 ) .",
    "nevertheless there are differences in the x - ray emission properties of rl and rq agn , especially in the features that are thought to arise in the reprocessing of the primary radiation . both the fe k@xmath9 fluorescence line and the compton reflection shoulder , ubiquitous in rq objects ( pounds et al . 1990 ,",
    "nandra & pounds 1994 ) , are typically weaker in rl objects ( sambruna et al . 1999 ) .",
    "this probably implies a different structure in the inner accretion disk in rl and rq objects .",
    "mechanisms that suppress the reflected component include a truncated accretion disk converted into a geometrically thick structure ( e.g. an adaf , see meier 2001 ) , and reflection in an ionized disk ( ballantyne , ross & fabian 2002 ) .",
    "hasenkopf , sambruna & eracleous ( 2002 ) analyzed the @xmath3 and @xmath10 x - ray spectra of 3 moderate - redshift radioquasars with luminosities @xmath11 and found similar properties , i.e. , presence of cold absorption and weak reflection components .",
    "it is intriguing that absorption by cold material appears to play a role both in the distinction between rl and rq objects as well as in the optical emission line properties of agn .",
    "rq narrow - line agns ( seyfert 2s ) tend to be more absorbed than rq broad - line agns ( seyfert 1s and qsos ) as predicted by the unified agn scheme ( antonucci 1993 ) .",
    "however a number unabsorbed seyfert 2 galaxies has been found ( pappa et al .",
    "2001 , panessa & bassani 2002 ) , lending some support to the idea that optical emission line properties are , at least in some cases , intrinsic to the broad line region rather than modulated by reddening / absorbing material ( barcons , carrera & ceballos 2003 ) .",
    "in this paper we study a narrow - line radioquasar ( rx  j1011.2 + 5545 ) at @xmath1 , one of the few high redshift examples of this class .",
    "it was discovered in the @xmath2 medium sensitivity survey ( carballo et al .",
    "1995 ) , where its pspc x - ray spectral shape qualified it as the hardest of the sources in the survey . a subsequent follow - up ( barcons et al . 1998 ) revealed that its @xmath12 optical counterpart is a rl narrow - line qso , where the ciii]@xmath13 semi - forbidden line has no detectable broad components , and mgii @xmath14 is extremely weak . the combined @xmath2 and @xmath3 x - ray spectrum suggested intrinsic absorption ( at a low significance level ) and also hinted an underlying flat x - ray spectrum .",
    "barcons et al .",
    "( 1998 ) derived an x - ray luminosity of @xmath15 and @xmath16 in the @xmath17  kev and @xmath18  kev bands respectively ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 used throughout ) .",
    "the double - lobed morphology of the radio counterpart ensures that beamed emission does not dominate the x - ray spectrum .",
    "this source is therefore an interesting example of an agn that _ should _ be absorbed by cold gas , both because it is radio loud and because its optical spectrum exhibits very weak ( if at all ) optical broad emission lines .",
    "rx  j1011.2 + 5545 was observed for about 33 ks by @xmath0 ( jansen et al 2001 ) on the 23 of november of 2001 during revolution 353 , within the ao-1 programme .",
    "all the instruments were on , although the prime objective , given the flux of the source , was to use the epic cameras ( turner et al .",
    "2001 , strder et al .",
    "all the epic cameras were operated in full window mode and equipped with the thin1 filter .",
    "the observation data file was pipeline - processed by sas v5.2 , but the analysis presented here has been conducted entirely using sas v5.3.3 .",
    "the epic event lists ( mos1 , mos2 and pn ) were cleaned of high background flares , resulting in good - time intervals of 29.7 , 30.0 and 24.6 ks respectively .",
    "further filtering followed the standard procedures , keeping only single and double events and , in the case of epic pn , those with flag=0 .",
    "since the x - ray data has to be compared to much better angular resolution optical and radio data , we also refined the astrometric solution of the pipeline event lists and images which is based on the attitude and orbit control system of the @xmath0 spacecraft .",
    "this astrometric solution is known to leave small ( up to a few arcsec ) but significant residuals .",
    "we then extracted all sources in the usno - a2 catalogue in the epic field of view , and looked for a shift and rotation in the epic pn source list provided by the pipeline by using the internal sas task eposcorr .",
    "a total of 47 x - ray to usno - a2 matches were found , and the correction that we applied to the x - ray data was @xmath22 , @xmath23 and a rotation of @xmath24 .",
    "our narrow - line radioquasar is well detected in all 3 epic cameras .",
    "furthermore , in the epic pn and in the epic mos1 cameras , the source shows some structure , in terms of x - ray emission towards the ne .",
    "figure  [ ximage ] shows the epic pn image in the @xmath25  kev band around the target , where the ne emission is most obvious .",
    "the mos1 image shows a similar structure , but this ne emission is not present in the mos2 data .",
    "we attribute this fact to the `` triangular '' shape of the point spread function ( psf ) of the x - ray telescope corresponding to the mos2 detector , which is highly asymmetric .     epic pn image of rx  j1011.2 + 5545 in the @xmath25  kev band , shown in equatorial coordinates ( j2000 ) . the pixel size is @xmath26 .",
    "the grey scale is linear with values between 10 and 100 counts per pixel .",
    "contours are from the 3.6 cm radio data with spacing defined under caption of fig .",
    "[ vlaimage],width=302 ]    the pipeline processed source list for these data does not find a second source in the position of the ne extension , which lies approximately 14  away from the central source .",
    "we tried hard to modify the source finding algorithm parameters , lowering the detection likelihood to 6 ( instead of 10 ) and enabling 2 sources to be fitted around each detection box .",
    "however , the sas refused to find a source there .",
    "a test for extended emission only gave a marginal detection ( likelihood @xmath27 ) in the mos1 image .",
    "in spite of this , it is clear from fig .",
    "[ ximage ] that the x - ray emission is real .",
    "no other x - ray sources in the image show a similar patch in the same direction , thus ruling out a bad attitude solution origin for this second source .",
    "our extracted spectrum for this source contains @xmath28 and @xmath29 background - subtracted counts in the epic pn and epic mos1 images respectively ( see sect .",
    ". further support for the reality of this source comes from the positional coincidence of this x - ray emission with an extended optical source ( see section 3 ) . in what follows",
    "we will refer to this faint x - ray source as `` source 2 '' , as opposed to `` source 1 '' , which is the target object rx  j1011.2 + 5545 .",
    "x - ray spectra have been extracted from the 3 epic cameras , first for the full emission complex ( i.e. , sources 1 and 2 together ) , as was done for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 data .",
    "spectra were extracted around the centre of the target within a circle of 25 arcsec , resulting in @xmath30 background - subtracted counts for the epic pn spectrum and over @xmath31 background - subtracted counts in each of the epic mos spectra .",
    "x - ray spectra were grouped in 10 count bins and counts below @xmath32  kev were ignored .",
    "no attempt was made to co - add spectra from different instruments , but instead they were fitted together .    in the barcons et al .",
    "( 1998 ) analysis of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 spectrum of this source , it was suggested that the x - ray spectrum could be intrinsically flat ( @xmath33 was the best fit ) with some marginal evidence for absorption ( 99% level ) . we therefore fitted the @xmath0 spectrum with a single power law plus galactic absorption ( fixed at @xmath34 ) .",
    "the fit gave a very poor @xmath35 for 229 degrees of freedom , with the residuals immediatly suggesting the need for a further absorption component .",
    "adding an intrinsic cold absorber at the redshift of the source gives a spectacular improvement with @xmath36 for 228 degrees of freedom .",
    "the f - test gives a significance of @xmath37 for absorption not being detected .",
    "the best - fit parameters are reported in table  [ xraypars ] .",
    "[ xraypars ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     fig .",
    "[ vlaimage ] shows the contours of the @xmath6 maps overlayed on the @xmath38 optical image .",
    "the 3.6 cm map clearly resolves the nucleus ( concident with the optical counterpart of rx  j1011.2 + 5545 ) and two lobes in the n - s direction .",
    "the 6 cm data exhibits the same structure , but without a clear separation between the northern lobe and the nucleus .    the variation in radio spectral index @xmath9 ( defined as @xmath39 between the 3.6 and 6 cm bands ) across the source ranges from @xmath40 to @xmath41 .",
    "table  [ spectral - index ] shows the radio spectral index at various locations of the radio source ( see caption of fig .",
    "[ vlaimage ] for definitions ) .",
    "the overall nucleus and double - lobe structure is consistent with a synchrotron self - absorbed nucleus plus ageing effects in the relativistic electron population along the lobes .",
    "the flatter spectral index of the n - lobe ( as compared to the s - lobe ) could be due to a variety of reasons , including the jet meeting a denser medium in the n - lobe zone , different ordering of the magnetic field , the orientation of the source etc .",
    "the steep - spectrum ne tail is consistent with freely expanding radio gas .",
    "it is also clear from fig .",
    "[ vlaimage ] that source 2 detected in the epic pn does not emit in radio , down to a 3@xmath42 sensitivity below @xmath43  mjy at both 3.6 and 6 cm .",
    "to further emphasize this , we overlay the 3.6 cm contours on the epic pn image in fig .",
    "[ ximage ] ( see also fig .",
    "[ notimage ] for the x - ray contours on top of the optical image ) .",
    "it can also be appreciated that , within the @xmath0 angular resolution , the x - ray emission matches very well that of the nucleus resolved by the radio maps with little contribution from the lobes .",
    "using the positions of the optical counterparts for sources 1 ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 , j2000 ) and 2 ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 , j2000 ) we can compute the possibility of finding two such close sources by chance .",
    "the relevant parameter is the source density at the flux of source 2 ( @xmath17  kev flux of @xmath48 ) which we take @xmath49 .",
    "the probability of finding source 2 within 14 arcsec of source 1 , being unrelated , is @xmath50 . although this is not a very significantly small number , we checked the possibility that source 2 could be somehow related to source 1 .",
    "we have further explored the possibility that source 2 results from the emission of a knot in a putative jet of source 1 , should they be at all related .",
    "( note , however , that the geometry of the radio maps does not suggest that hypothesis ) .",
    "such knots have been found to be x - ray emitters in several objects , among them 3c273 ( marshall et al .",
    "2001 ) . if we take the a1 knot as quoted in marshall et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and scaling from the flux measured at @xmath51  kev from the @xmath0 data in source 2 ( @xmath52 ) we would expect a radio flux around 6 cm of @xmath53  mjy . our @xmath6 data , which sets a 3@xmath42 upper limit of 0.1  mjy  beam@xmath54 at the position of source 2 , clearly rules out that option .",
    "we can therefore conclude that source 2 is a real x - ray source , with an optical counterpart of @xmath7 and to our knowledge unrelated to source 1 .",
    "the main conclusion of this work is that the x - ray emission properties of this narrow - line radioquasar are very similar to those of broad - line radioquasars of similar luminosity .",
    "the apparently flat x - ray spectrum found by @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the result of a steep power law ( photon spectral index @xmath55 ) seen through an intrinsic absorbing column @xmath56 , in agreement with the results from hasenkopf et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for broad - line radioquasars of similar luminosity .",
    "the typically flatter spectral index attributed earlier to rl agns @xmath57 is totally excluded in this narrow - line radioquasar ( see again fig .  [ xcont_tot ] ) .",
    "this confirms that relativistic beaming does not play a major role in its x - ray emission , as expected from the double - lobe radio morphology .",
    "the x - ray spectrum displays moderate cold absorption ( in excess of galactic absorption ) , also in the same range as the hasenkopf et al .",
    "( 2002 ) broad - line radioquasars of similar luminosity ( but lower redshift ) @xmath58 .",
    "the overall spectral energy distribution ( shown in barcons et al 1998 ) is similar to the template for rl qsos as shown in fig .",
    "10 of elvis et al ( 1994 ) , except for the harder x - ray slope resulting from intrinsic absorption .",
    "the measured absorption column is , however , on the lower side of that expected for narrow - line agn . indeed , in a large sample of [ oiii]-selected narrow - line rq agn ( seyfert 1.8 , 1.9 and mostly 2 galaxies ) , risaliti , maiolino & salvati ( 1999 ) found that the majority of these sources are absorbed by columns @xmath59 .",
    "this should be expected in the framework of the agn unified model , where the lack or weakness of optical broad emission lines would be due to reddening by the same gas that absorbs soft x - rays .",
    "nevertheless , a number of examples of rq narrow - line seyferts have been found with small or no cold absorbing column at all ( pappa et al .",
    "2000 , panessa & bassani 2002 , barcons et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the narrow - line radioquasar studied here also belongs to this class of low - absorption column objects , where the lack of optical broad - lines is difficult to understand in terms of reddening / absorption and could be attributed to intrinsic properties of the broad line region .",
    "it is also remarkable that no reflection features are present in this object , down to the sensitivity level of our rather high quality x - ray data .",
    "however the 3@xmath42 upper limit found for the equivalent width of the fe line ( @xmath60 ev in the case of a relatively narrow line @xmath61  kev ) is not in conflict with a reflection component consistently small , as in broad - line radioquasars of similar luminosity ( hasenkopf et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "it would be interesting to study other narrow - line radioquasars of similar luminosity to check whether the properties of rx  j1011.2 + 5545 are peculiar ( in the sense of moderate absorbing column of cold gas and weak reflection features ) or relatively general .",
    "bright and medium sensitivity x - ray surveys performed with @xmath0 should be particularly sensitive to this type of sources ( even more heavily absorbed ) , where modest follow - up exposures could deliver x - ray data of enough quality to merit a spectral analysis as the one presented here .",
    "the work reported herein is based partly on observations obtained with @xmath0 , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and the usa ( nasa ) .",
    "the @xmath38 telescope is operated by the nordic optical telescope scientific association on the spanish observatorio del roque de los muchachos of the instituto de astrofsica de canarias .",
