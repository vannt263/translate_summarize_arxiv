    "the question of determining the model that best describes the universe is the ultimate goal of cosmology .",
    "the energy - momentum content of the present universe seems to be a perfect fluid mainly consisting of a dark sector ( possibly consisting of a dark energy and a dark matter component ) , baryonic matter , and radiation @xcite . in the standard model of cosmology ( namely , @xmath0cdm )",
    "dark matter @xcite and baryonic matter are considered to be dust , dark energy @xcite is taken to be the einstein s cosmological constant , and radiation is described by the usual energy - momentum term for radiation . although the standard model seems to be compatible with observations yet it has some problems .",
    "the magnitudes of potential theoretical contributions to cosmological constant ( cc ) are extremely higher than the value of cc deduced from the energy density of the universe @xcite .",
    "there are many attempts to solve this problem , namely , the cc problem .",
    "nevertheless none is wholly satisfactory .",
    "the best option seems to employ a symmetry such as metric reversal symmetry @xcite to cancel cc and then attribute the dark energy to something else e.g. to modified gravity @xcite , or to some scalar field such as quintessence @xcite .",
    "cold dark matter ( i.e. dust - like dark matter with no or negligible interaction with itself and with baryonic matter and photons ) scenario of @xmath0cdm as well suffers from some problems such as rotation curves of spiral - like galaxies i.e. cuspy halo problem , missing satellite galaxies problem @xcite .",
    "there are many alternatives to cold dark matter ( cdm ) scenario including warm - dark matter @xcite , bose - einstein condensate dark matter @xcite , and scalar field dark matter @xcite .",
    "the above considerations essentially hold for the time from the radiation dominated era till the present era . the standard paradigm for the era before the radiation dominated era is an inflationary era ( that serves to solve the problems of the standard cosmology such as horizon , flatness , absence of monopoles problems ) @xcite .",
    "usually the inflationary era and the epoch after this era are studied separately .",
    "this is not only due to the need to concentrate on each of these and to try to understand each epoch better before a possible unification .",
    "in fact the most serious problem in the direction of the unification of the whole cosmic history is the difficulty of merging these two epochs because of the form of the dependence of the energy density of dust and radiation on scale factor ( i.e. on redshift ) . in @xmath0cdm",
    "the energy density of radiation dominates over that of inflaton if one goes back to sufficiently large redshifts .",
    "this is due to the fact that the energy density of inflaton is essentially constant during inflationary era while the energy density of radiation scales like @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the scale factor . in other words , to have a true unification , the creation of radiation and matter after the inflationary era must be taken into account in the scale factor without destroying the standard cosmology before and after the inflation , and this is not an easy task .",
    "the models in literature that unify all eras of cosmological evolution in a single model @xcite are not wholly realistic since they do not include baryonic matter although they are able to produce eras of cosmological evolution with correct equations of state in the corresponding eras , and some have graceful exit from inflationary era . the matter in these models",
    "must be identified with dark matter since the energy densities of these models do not contain energy components that scale proportional to @xmath3 for all times ( or at least for a sufficiently long time ) .",
    "the models in @xcite use the energy densities expressed in terms of simple functions of hubble parameter and/or scale parameter as the starting point rather than starting from the scale factor .",
    "although one may , in principle , determine the scale factor from this information the form of scale factor may be rather complicated in some cases .",
    "on the other hand a relatively simple scale factor may result in a rather complicated and unmanageable functional form for the energy density when expressed in terms of the scale factor or the hubble parameter .",
    "therefore in some cases it may be more suitable to consider a specific ansatz for scale factor such as in this study and in @xcite .",
    "the same approach is adopted in this study .",
    "moreover the present study introduces a general prescription to include dust and radiation into unification .    in this study , first , in section ii , i introduce a scheme to unify the cosmological evolution before and after the radiation dominated era .",
    "then i give a concrete realization of this scheme in section iii . in section",
    "iv i discuss the observational compatibility of this scheme in the context of the model introduced in section iii .",
    "finally i conclude in section v. the scale factor in this model is a sum of two terms .",
    "the first term is a pure dark energy contribution .",
    "the second term is responsible for the baryonic matter and radiation terms and additional terms that may be mainly identified with dark matter .",
    "there is also an additional term due to coupling between these terms , and this term gives another contribution to the dark energy and dark matter .",
    "some of the ideas employed here have been already studied in literature . in this study",
    "i do not make a sharp distinction between dark energy and dark matter because the dark energy and dark matter terms are coupled and the equation of state ( eos ) of some terms e.g. eos of the coupling term between dark matter and dark energy terms evolve with time .",
    "the superficiality of a distinction between dark energy and dark matter is considered in many studies in literature , either explicitly or implicitly @xcite .",
    "this option is quite possible since dark energy and dark matter are not observed directly .",
    "what we see observationally is a missing element in the energy - momentum tensor of the einstein equations , other than baryonic matter and radiation , and this missing quantity may be described by two components ; dark energy and dark matter .",
    "it is , in principle , equally possible that this quantity is composed of a single component , say , dark fluid .",
    "in @xcite i had introduced a universe composed of a dark fluid ( that may be written in terms of two scalar fields ) .",
    "in fact the scale factor in that study is essentially @xmath4 in eq.([a2 ] ) of this paper .",
    "the present study , somewhat , may be considered as an extension of @xcite where baryonic matter and radiation are included .",
    "however there are important differences as well .",
    "the main aim of this study is to introduce a scheme to merge the cosmological evolution of the time before and after the production of radiation into a single scale factor with the baryonic matter and the usual radiation terms included .",
    "the modified form of @xmath4 in @xcite only serves as a realization of this scheme .",
    "furthermore i do not discuss the scalar field identification of the energy density due the part of the scale factor similar to @xmath4 of @xcite ( although it can be easily done ) , and i do not consider the cosmological perturbations of these quantities , and the inflationary era in this study because these points would cause divergence of the main goal of the paper and would increase the volume of this study drastically .",
    "i leave these points to future studies .",
    "consider the robertson - walker metric @xmath5 i take the 3-dimensional space be flat , i.e. @xmath6 for the sake of simplicity , which is an assumption consistent with cosmological observations @xcite .",
    "i let the form of the scale factor be @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the present time .",
    "we will see that @xmath4 is the part of the scale factor responsible for dark energy and dark matter , and @xmath9 is the one mainly responsible for dust and radiation and additional contribution to dark matter - energy , and we shall see later that a mixing between the sectors due to @xmath10 and @xmath11 act as an additional source of dark energy . we assume that @xmath4 and @xmath9 are chosen in such a way that @xmath12 for all @xmath13 . in general one may identify the dust by a mixture of baryonic matter and dust - like dark matter .",
    "the best fit values that i could find by trial and error for the specific toy model considered in this study for implementation of the present scheme seem to prefer the case where the dust term is wholly or almost wholly due to baryonic matter .",
    "we first focus on the @xmath9 term and specify it as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is some function that its form will be specified later .",
    "( [ a2 ] ) and ( [ a3 ] ) may be used to relate @xmath16 and @xmath4 , @xmath9 in a more applicable way , and to derive the corresponding hubble parameter .",
    "we observe that @xmath17 in a similar way the hubble parameter is found to be @xmath18 where we have used @xmath19 note that @xmath20 by convention .",
    "we let @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 are some constant coefficients , and @xmath24\\,,~   \\tilde{h}_2^{(2 ) }   \\,=\\,\\alpha_{o2}\\left[\\frac{\\alpha_b}{a^{\\frac{3}{2}}}+   \\frac{\\alpha_r}{a^2}-\\frac{\\alpha_k}{a}\\right]\\,,~   \\tilde{h}_2^{(3 ) }   \\,=\\,\\alpha_c\\left(\\frac{1}{a^3}-\\frac{1}{a}\\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ \\label{a10a } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 are some other constant coefficients .",
    "in fact , in ( [ a3a ] ) we could take the simpler form where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "this would be enough as long as we are concerned only with merging of the eras before and after the radiation domination , and the resulting model would be compatible with union2 data set at an order of magnitude level . the more involved form in ( [ a3a ] ) is used to make the model phenomenologically more viable .",
    "this point will be discussed when we discuss the phenomenological viability of the model in section iv .",
    "one may determine @xmath35 in eq.([a4b ] ) by using eq.([a3a ] ) , @xmath36\\ ] ] where @xmath37 \\label{c2 } \\\\",
    "k(t)&=&\\frac{a_2}{c_1-c_2}x_3\\left[c_2\\alpha_{o2}\\alpha_kx_2- \\alpha_c\\left(c_1x_1-c_2x_2\\right)\\right ] \\label{c3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence one may express ( [ a4b ] ) as @xmath38 where @xmath39    we let @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 . because the three dimensional part of metric is taken to be flat the present energy density is equal to the critical energy density the above equations imply that @xmath46 note that , at this point @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 can not be identified as density parameters since density parameters should satisfy @xmath52+@xmath53+@xmath54+@xmath55+@xmath56=1 . in chapter iv we will see that this condition is not satisfied for the phenomenologically viable sets of parameters , so @xmath47 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 can not be identified as density parameters separately , instead one must define the total density parameter for dark sector by @xmath57=@xmath58 rather than the separate contribution due to @xmath59 and @xmath60 while i identify @xmath48 , @xmath49 as the density parameters corresponding dust and radiation . therefore to retain the physical content of this paper more evident",
    "i will not make a distinction between @xmath48 , @xmath49 and the density parameters for baryonic matter , radiation ; @xmath53 , @xmath54 while i keep this distinction for the others i.e. for the ones due to @xmath59 and @xmath60 terms .",
    "the @xmath61 and @xmath62 terms result in energy densities that are identified as the energy densities for baryonic matter and radiation . in principle",
    ", there may be also contributions due to the @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the sign of the @xmath63 term is negative of the usual stiff matter .",
    "it may be identified as stiff matter under pressure so that it has a negative deceleration parameter .",
    "the main function of this term is to damp the energy densities of baryonic matter and radiation in the time before the radiation dominated era .",
    "the function of the @xmath65 term is similar .",
    "it ensures the behavior of the energy density in late times be well - behaved ( i.e. preventing the energy density to grow too fast ( through the @xmath65 term in @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) ) .",
    "although the @xmath64 term is similar to that of a negative curvature 3-space it is different from such a term since its origin is the hubble parameter @xmath68 while a usual 3-curvature term arises from the 3-curvature part of metric .",
    "note that this term arises even in a flat 3-space in this construction .",
    "therefore i identify the @xmath69 and @xmath70 terms in @xmath68 as additional contributions to dark sector .",
    "another point worth to mention is ; it is evident that the square of ( [ a4b ] ) ( in conjunction with ( [ a10a ] ) ) results in an @xmath71 term containing @xmath72 and @xmath73 terms that may be identified with the standard baryonic matter and radiation terms , respectively if @xmath74 is taken to be constant while it depends on time in this scheme as it is evident from ( [ a3a ] ) .",
    "in fact variation of @xmath74 with time makes it possible to go to zero before the radiation dominated era as desired .",
    "therefore , given the considerable success of the standard model at least in the observed relatively small redshifts , the variation in @xmath74 after the matter - radiation decoupling time should be small so that this scheme mimics the standard model at relatively small redshifts where observational data is available .",
    "if one takes @xmath75 sufficiently small one may guarantee an almost constant value for @xmath74 for a sufficiently long time ( e.g. from the present time till the beginning of the radiation dominated era ) .",
    "we will see in section iv that there exist such values of @xmath74 with reasonable phenomenological viability .",
    "another term arising from @xmath76 is the cross term , @xmath77 .",
    "this term may be identified as the energy density term due to the transitory time where massive particles that act as radiation at high energies turn into more dust - like at intermediate energies .",
    "another term in @xmath78 is @xmath79 .",
    "this term will be considered as a pure dark sector term .",
    "finally the cross term @xmath80 gives an additional contribution to the dark sector for the phenomenologically viable values of the parameters .",
    "it may be easily shown that this term does not necessarily imply strong interaction between the dark fluid and radiation and baryonic matter as its form may suggest if the parameters of the underlying physics at microscopic scale satisfy some restrictions .",
    "otherwise one may use screening mechanisms such as @xcite to explain the unobservablity of dark matter - energy .",
    "next we derive the general form of the equation of state for this model .",
    "we derive the explicit form of the equation of state after ( eos ) after we give the explicit form of @xmath4 in the section . however giving the general form of eos in this scheme",
    "provides us a more model independent formula and may be useful for other choices of @xmath4 in future .",
    "after using eqs.([a3ac],[a3da],[a3db],[a3dc ] ) one obtains eos , @xmath81 as @xmath82 the terms inside the first parenthesis in the second line correspond to the contribution of the dark sector term @xmath59 .",
    "the other terms in the same line correspond to the contributions of dust and radiation and their coupling with dark sector term @xmath59 .",
    "the remaining terms are the term corresponding to variation of @xmath74 , the term corresponding to coupling of curvature - like term and the stiff matter under negative pressure with dust and radiation , the term corresponding to coupling of curvature - like term and the stiff matter under negative pressure with @xmath59 , the term corresponding to coupling of curvature - like term and the stiff matter under negative pressure with the other terms , and the contribution of the curvature - like term and the stiff matter under negative pressure , respectively .",
    "it is evident from ( [ a11a ] ) that the pressure for baryonic matter is zero as should be , and the pressure for radiation is @xmath83 as expected .",
    "a point worth to mention at this point is ; the coupling term between baryonic matter and radiation in eq.([a11a ] ) has an equation of state @xmath84 ( that may be seen by considering the ratio of the @xmath85 in @xmath86 by the corresponding term in @xmath87 i.e. @xmath88 ) .",
    "the redshift dependence of this term is between that of baryonic matter and radiation .",
    "this time dependence is more natural than the standard picture where there is no such term .",
    "massive particles at high energies act as radiation and at lower turns into dust . the coupling term accounts for the transitory time when massive particles pass from radiation to dust state .    in order to obtain the evolution of @xmath81 as a function redshift or time explicitly",
    ", @xmath59 must be specified .",
    "this will be done in the next section .",
    "however i give a @xmath81 versus redshift graph in fig.[fig:1 ] for @xmath89 introduced in the next section for a phenomenologically viable set of parameters ( i.e. those with small @xmath90 values and with energy densities for recombination and nucleosynthesis as discussed in section iv ) to have an idea about the evolution of @xmath81 with redshift .",
    "to draw this graph i have converted time , t to redshift , z ( for union2.1 data ) through the relation @xmath91 , and then used mathematica to use this relation to make the calculations ( although the original quantities are expressed in terms of time ) .",
    "this procedure is applicable for small redshifts . however , in general , it becomes inapplicable due to highly non - linear form of scale factor and hubble parameter since it requires huge ram and cpu for computation , if it can be done at all , and hence requires a separate computational physics project by itself .",
    "therefore i have used equation of state versus and energy density versus time graphs ( instead of redshift ) in section iv .",
    "in fact , even that option required a long time of order of months to make the necessary computations .",
    "now we focus on the @xmath4 term .",
    "we take @xmath92^r\\,\\exp{[-b_1(b_2t)^{-1/s } ] } \\label{a13b } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 are some constants that to be fixed or bounded by consistency arguments or cosmological observations .",
    "this scale factor is a generalization of the scale factor in @xcite where @xmath98 , @xmath99 .",
    "a similar scale factor is considered in @xcite as well .",
    "one of the shortcomings of @xcite is that the present value of the equation of state parameter in that model ( for phenomenologically relevant choices of parameters where the model mimics @xmath0cdm ) is @xmath100 while observations imply that it should be @xmath101  @xmath102 @xcite . in the present study",
    "there is an additional contribution due to mixing of the terms due to @xmath10 and @xmath11 and hence there is less need to modify the scale factor in @xcite .",
    "however i prefer to adopt the more general form in ( [ a13b ] ) to seek a greater parameter space and to insure the correct equation of state parameter .      after determining the @xmath59 we are almost ready to find the explicit values of the energy density and the equation of state .",
    "the only missing element for calculation of these quantities is to find @xmath74 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 in ( [ a3ac ] , [ a3da ] , [ a3db ] , [ a3dc ] ) .",
    "another point to be addressed is to show that there exist sets of a whose variation with time are small for low redshifts so that the terms that are proportional to @xmath115 and @xmath116 in @xmath117 term may be identified with dust and usual radiation terms , respectively .    in order to determine @xmath74 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 ( and to determine the rate of variation of @xmath74 with time )",
    "one should derive an approximation scheme for the evaluation of these quantities because these quantities depend on @xmath118 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 ( that are defined in ( [ a3b ] ) and ( [ a3c ] ) ) , and these quantities , in turn , are defined in a recursive way since @xmath119=@xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) and @xmath122 depend on @xmath16 , and @xmath16 , in turn , depends on @xmath119 through eq.([a4a ] ) .",
    "in other words , in order to determine the approximate values of @xmath119 one must identify the zeroth order approximation and a method how to obtain the higher order approximations in an iterative way .",
    "one may use the following observations to obtain the zeroth order approximation ; @xmath123 and @xmath124 @xmath125 @xmath126 ( @xmath121 ) i.e. @xmath127 , @xmath128 for small redshifts .",
    "this implies that the zeroth order approximation for the scale factor @xmath16 should be taken as @xmath129 hence for phenomenologically viable cases ( where @xmath124 for small redshifts ) one may take the zeroth order approximations as @xmath130 where @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 is obtained from @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 by replacing @xmath16 by @xmath137 in those expression , for example , @xmath138 then @xmath139 one may get the next order approximation by using @xmath140 the next order quantities @xmath141 , @xmath142 may be obtained from ( [ d1 ] ) and ( [ d2 ] ) by replacing the superindices @xmath143 by @xmath144 where @xmath145 here @xmath146 is obtained from @xmath122 by replacing @xmath16 by @xmath147 . for kth approximation",
    "we replace @xmath16 by @xmath148 . in principle",
    "this may be done up to arbitrarily higher order approximations but it is quite difficult to calculate even @xmath141 even with the help of computers .",
    "in fact i have divided the interval @xmath149 in to coarser subintervals to decrease the cpu time and have used the approximate numerical values in the ith interval ( by assuming @xmath150 to be almost constant in those intervals ) by using the formula @xmath151 to find @xmath141 .",
    "i have seen ( by trial and error ) that it is possible to find almost constant @xmath150 and @xmath141 values for many relevant ( i.e. of small @xmath90 values considered in the next section ) choices of parameters , @xmath27 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath28 , @xmath157 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "for example the variations of @xmath150 and @xmath141 with time for one of the phenemonologically viable sets in table [ table-9 ] is given in table [ table-1 ] .",
    "now we check the phenomenological viability of the model .",
    "the observational analysis of the model for all possible values of the parameters , @xmath158 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath159 , @xmath154 , etc . is an extremely difficult job ( if not impossible at all ) because expressing the hubble parameter , deceleration parameter etc . in terms of the scale factor",
    "is quite difficult since these quantities are highly nonlinear functions of the scale factor in this model .",
    "therefore i adopt some guidelines to seek the phenomenologically viable sets of parameters .",
    "these guidelines are : + 1- i take the model mimic the standard model i.e. the @xmath0cdm model , at least from the time of decoupling of matter and radiation up to the present time . therefore i take the present time values of the equation of state of the whole universe and the density parameter of the baryonic matter and radiation to be the same as @xmath0cdm .",
    "+ 2- in searching for the phenomenologically viable parameter space i start from the values of the parameters in @xcite i.e. @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath160 , and @xmath161 since the universe studied in @xcite mimics the true universe roughly .",
    "+ 3- due to the highly non - linear relation between the hubble parameter and the scale factor i seek the relevant parameter space usually by trial and error rather than a continuous scan of the parameter space .",
    "therefore the optimum values obtained here most probably may not correspond to the best possible optimization .",
    "rather they hopefully correspond to a good approximation to the best optimal values .      in this subsection",
    "we use the union2.1 compilation data set to find the optimal values of @xmath158 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 starting from @xmath162 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 .",
    "we find the theoretical values of distance moduli , @xmath163 for the redshift values of union2.1 and calculate the corresponding @xmath90 value by using the measured values of @xmath163 and their errors .",
    "the expression for distance modulus is @xmath164 where @xmath165 where for small redshifts reduces to @xmath166 where we have used the requirement that @xmath167 at small redshifts as discussed in the preceding section ( see table [ table-7 ] ) , and @xmath168 . in @xmath0cdm @xmath169",
    "is usually expressed in terms of redshift , @xmath170 and hubble parameter @xmath68 , and then the results for different @xmath170 s are compared with the data directly .",
    "this is not possible in this model because @xmath68 can not be expressed in terms of @xmath16 in a simple way .",
    "therefore in this study first we convert redshift values of union2 to time values by using @xmath171 and then solve it for @xmath172 . the corresponding expression for the theoretical value of the luminosity distance @xmath173 in this case ( i.e. in terms of @xmath172 ) is @xmath174^r } \\int_\\gamma^1   d\\gamma\\frac{\\beta^{-1+\\gamma^{-\\frac{1}{s } } } } { [ 1+\\frac{\\gamma-1}{r}\\left(\\xi\\xi_1-\\frac{1}{s}\\ln{\\beta}\\right)]^r } \\label{mu2}\\ ] ] where @xmath137 is expressed in terms of @xmath158 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath175 by using the parameterization given in the preceding section .",

    ". then we find ( [ mu1b ] ) numerically for each of the @xmath172 corresponding to observational redshifts .",
    "finally we find the corresponding @xmath178 values by using the formula @xmath179 where the subscript @xmath180 in @xmath181 and the superscript @xmath143 in @xmath182 stands for the fact that @xmath16 is approximated by its zeroth order approximation i.e. by @xmath89 , the superindices @xmath183 and @xmath184 stand for the theoretical and observational values of @xmath163 , and the subindices @xmath185 denote the values of the corresponding quantity for the @xmath185th data point in union2 data set .",

    "however one may define a total density parameter for the dark sector by @xmath207 then the density parameters satisfies the necessary condition , @xmath208 .",
    "in other words , @xmath59 and @xmath60 terms can not be identified as separate contributions to dark sector , rather they must be considered as just a single object in order not to introduce an ambiguity in their identification .      in this subsection",
    "we investigate if this model is compatible with the cosmological depiction of the recombination and nucleosynthesis , at least , at the order of magnitude level . in a similar vein as the preceding subsection we require this model",
    "mimic the standard model , @xmath0cdm , as much as possible .",
    "we assume that the radiation and the baryonic matter are in thermal equilibrium in the eras of recombination and nucleosynthesis since we adopt the same equations of thermal equilibrium as @xmath0cdm .",
    "therefore , in the following , first we drive the condition for thermal equilibrium for this model",
    ". then we find the sets of parameters with least @xmath90 values that may produce successful recombination and nucleosynthesis eras .",
    "the correct choices should have sufficient radiation energy densities in these eras .",
    "in other words the redshift at the recombination time , @xmath209 should be in the order of @xmath210 where * denotes time of last scattering surface ; and in the nucleosynthesis era the energy density of neutrinos should reach energy densities of the order of @xmath211 .",
    "we seek an approximate , rough agreement with @xmath0cdm since the search of the parameter space is done by trial and error rather than a systematic search of the whole parameter space . therefore a detailed , thorough analysis and compatibility survey would be too ambitious especially considering this is a toy model .    before checking",
    "if there exist a set of parameters compatible with recombination and nucleosynthesis we should check if the thermal equilibrium is maintained in these eras in for the given set of parameters because we adopt the standard analysis in @xmath0cdm , and that analysis assumes existence of thermal equilibrium . as is well known , if there is thermal equilibrium then we should have @xmath212 where @xmath213 is the rate of the interaction between radiation and the matter and @xmath68 is the hubble parameter .",
    "however the implementation of this condition in this model is not exactly the same as in @xmath0cdm . in the case of recombination era",
    "the implementation of this condition does not give exactly the same result as @xmath0cdm since , in @xmath0cdm the recombination takes place in radiation dominated era and the total energy density is almost wholly due to radiation while , in this model , the total energy density of the universe at this era is not almost wholly due to radiation although the equation of state parameter for phenomenologically relevant cases is similar that of radiation dominated universe at the time of recombination and we require the radiation energy density to be the same or almost the same as @xmath0cdm . in the case of nucleosynthesis ,",
    "even the equation state parameter in this model does not mimic that of a radiation dominated universe .",
    "therefore we should derive the corresponding conditions for thermal equilibrium for this model .",
    "the condition for thermal equilibrium in the recombination era is @xmath214 here we have used the identities , @xmath215 where @xmath216 is the @xmath0cdm value and @xmath217 at the time of recombination and is not constant in this model , and i have used the pdg values , @xmath218 , @xmath219 . note that @xmath213 in ( [ rn5 ] ) is the same as the @xmath0cdm value while @xmath68 is different from the @xmath0cdm value .",
    "next consider the condition on thermal equilibrium at and before the time of nucleosynthesis .",
    "in thermal equilibrium we have @xmath220 where we have used the identity similar to ( [ rn5a ] ) , where @xmath221 and the subindex @xmath222 are replaced by @xmath223 and @xmath152 , respectively and the ratio is evaluated at the time of nucleosynthesis . in this case , as well , @xmath224 is the same as its @xmath0cdm value while the expression for @xmath68 in terms of temperature is different since @xmath225 and is not a constant ( i.e. it gives a different value when evaluated at different time during nucleosynthesis ) in this model while @xmath226 in @xmath0cdm . during thermal equilibrium",
    "the ratio of neutrinos to all nucleons , @xmath227 is given by @xmath228 where @xmath229 is the rest mass energy difference between a neutron and a proton , @xmath230 .",
    "after the thermal equilibrium between the neutrinos and the nucleons are lost i.e. after decoupling the value of @xmath227 further decreases due to decay of free neutrons as @xmath231 } \\label{rn9}\\ ] ] where @xmath232 is the @xmath227 of eq.([rn8 ] ) at the time of decoupling , and @xmath233 seconds is the lifetime of a free neutron .",
    "therefore the effect of this model is to change the value of @xmath232 ( that depends on @xmath223 ) and probably the value of @xmath227 as well .",
    "now we are ready to check the viability of this model .",
    "i could give only four graphs and three tables that partially summarize the results of my calculations related to this and the next paragraphs in order not to expand the size of the paper too much .",
    "otherwise the size of the manuscript would be almost doubled .",
    "first we check the viability of the model for recombination and nucleosynthesis eras . to this end",
    "i have used the equations ( [ a11a],[a16c],[a3db],[a3dc ] ) in the zeroth order approximation where @xmath234 ( as discussed before eq.([a3ba ] ) ) to draw @xmath81 , @xmath235 , versus time graphs by using a mathematica code that i have prepared for this aim for the sets of the parameters , @xmath152,@xmath153,@xmath158,@xmath236 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath237,@xmath238 , @xmath239 , @xmath157,@xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath8 @xmath240 , that correspond to some relatively small @xmath90 values obtained in preceding subsection .",
    "then i have tried to find at least one set of parameters with phenomenologically viable @xmath241 , @xmath235 , @xmath242 values i.e. @xmath241 , in the range @xmath243 @xmath244 ; @xmath245 ( in the range of redshifts @xmath246 ) at the time of recombination , and @xmath247 at the time of nucleosynthesis where i have approximated @xmath118 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 by @xmath248 , @xmath249 , @xmath250 ( that are defined in eq.([a3ba ] ) ) , and @xmath16 by @xmath137 ( that is defined in ( [ a13b ] ) ) as discussed in the preceding section .",
    "i have found two sets of parameters given in table [ table-9 ] that satisfy these conditions .",
    "a comment is in order at this point .",
    "the zeroth order approximation is reliable only for small redshifts .",
    "however this approximation is reliable at any redshift if one is only interested in the energy density - redshift relation .",
    "this may be seen as follows : assume that the energy density @xmath87 is related to redshift @xmath170 by @xmath251 in the zeroth order approximation ( where @xmath252 is an arbitrary function ) , and in an approximation better than the zeroth order we have @xmath253 i.e. @xmath254 . then the energy density after the correction is @xmath255 .",
    "if one rescales @xmath256 as @xmath257 then one obtains the same redshift and energy density values . in other words",
    "the redshift - energy density relation is invariant under such corrections .",
    "however this is not true for the redshift - time relation .",
    "if the approximation is not a good approximation to the true value then the redshift - time relation will be distorted .",
    "this , in turn , may cause the distortion of the value of the equation of state and the distortion of the variation of the energy densities with time in an amount depending on the reliability of zeroth order approximation . keeping these observations in mind",
    "i content to use zeroth order approximation for the times of recombination and nucleosynthesis because even employing zeroth order approximation needs a lot of computer cpu and ram , and in many cases the use of first order approximation as well does not improve the situation .",
    "we will come back to these points when discuss the times of recombination and nucleosynthesis .",
    "next i have checked if thermal equilibrium is maintained at the times of recombination and nucleosynthesis and if recombination and nucleosynthesis are realized in this model .",
    "one may have an idea on thermal equilibrium at the time of recombination by using the values of table [ table-9 ] at @xmath258 and eq.([rn5 ] ) . however a more rigorous way",
    "is to draw @xmath259 ( that may be obtained from eq.([rn5 ] ) ) versus time graphs to determine the time intervals ( and then the corresponding redshift intervals ) where @xmath260 for each of the sets a and b. in fact i have used @xmath261 for the relevant redshifts .",
    "the resulting intervals are the intervals where thermal equilibrium is maintained as shown in figure [ fig:15 ] for the set b in table [ table-9 ] .",
    "the smallest redshifts where the thermal equilibrium is lost are @xmath262 ( @xmath263 with @xmath264 ) and @xmath265 ( @xmath266 @xmath267 ) for the sets a and b , respectively .",
    "this implies that the photon electron decoupling takes place before the time of last scattering at an energy of @xmath268 ev@xmath269 ev and @xmath270 ev@xmath271 ev for the sets a and b , respectively ( assuming the transition being directly to the ground state of hydrogen atom ) to be compared to the value of photon energy of about @xmath272 ev@xmath273 ev for @xmath0cdm at the time of last scattering .",
    "this , in turn , implies that photon electron decoupling in this model for the sets of parameters a and b is at a smaller redshift than @xmath0cdm where thermal equilibrium is maintained until decoupling .",
    "( thermal equilibrium would be maintained till @xmath274 in @xmath0cdm if recombination of electrons and protons to form neutral atoms had not taken place as may be seen from ( [ rn5 ] ) by setting @xmath275 ) .",
    "in fact the corresponding times for decoupling are already smaller than that of @xmath0cdm by five orders of magnitude .",
    "a detailed comprehensive separate study is need to see if these imply some interesting phenomenologically viable alternatives or just an artifact of the toy model and/or the sets of parameters considered .",
    "this may also be due to the limitation of the applicability of zeroth order approximation that we have discussed above .",
    "@xmath234 is not violated badly at the time of recombination for the most of the relevant sets of parameters .",
    "for example for the sets of parameters given in table [ table-9 ] the first order approximation results in @xmath276 i.e. @xmath277 and does not vary much at the time of recombination .",
    "therefore it seems that the effect of the limitation of the applicability of zeroth order approximation to the time of recombination must be limited .",
    "however this shift does not introduce a major problem since the redshift values , hence the photon energy density at recombination remains almost the same and thermal equilibrium is maintained .",
    "next i have checked if thermal equilibrium is maintained at the peaks in table [ table-9 ] where the energy densities are sufficient for nucleosynthesis .",
    "i have used eq.([rn7 ] ) to find the range of temperatures where thermal equilibrium is maintained .",
    "i have found that this condition is satisfied for @xmath278 ( provided that @xmath279 ) for the second peaks .",
    "this value gives us @xmath232 in ( [ rn9 ] ) by using ( [ rn8 ] ) as @xmath280 which is quite large compared to the @xmath0cdm value of @xmath281 .",
    "the time that takes @xmath282 drop to 0.07 mev ( that is when @xmath283 ) in this model is something like @xmath284 seconds .",
    "therefore @xmath232 does not drop significantly through eq.([rn9 ] ) . in other words",
    "the final result @xmath285 is much larger than the @xmath0cdm value @xmath286 ( which agrees well with observations ) .",
    "probably the main source of this discrepancy is inapplicability of zeroth order approximations to redhifts and energy densities to this era to obtain correct energy density - time relations .",
    "the variations of @xmath287 and @xmath74 are quite large and their values are quite different than those at @xmath288 at the time of nucleosynthesis that makes the applicability of the zeroth order approximation extremely difficult to obtain correct energy density - time relation . in other words",
    "the main source of the discrepancy may be due to the fact that the real time of free decay may be of the order of @xmath289 seconds in this model instead of 90 seconds .",
    "the use of first order approximation does not improve the situation because in the calculation of first order approximations to @xmath287 and @xmath290 one uses the zeroth order approximation @xmath291 in the integrals for @xmath292 , @xmath121 .",
    "this , in turn , results in over contribution of large redshifts and hence larger and more varying @xmath292 with respect to their true values since @xmath293 and they get smaller i.e. @xmath287 gets larger at larger redshifts .",
    "therefore the energy density versus time graphs in the figures [ fig:9 ] , [ fig:10 ] and [ fig:15 ] must be considered with some care : the time values in those graphs should be taken with utmost care especially in the case of nucleosynthesis while the magnitudes of energy densities and the corresponding redshifts are expected to be the same as the exact values .",
    "all these points must be studied in more detail in future studies .",
    "however i have been able to show that this scheme can produce a model that mimics the standard model : there is a current accelerated epoch whose present equation of state ( for the whole universe ) is  -0.7 ( that is , at least , roughly in agreement with observations e.g. see the value in table [ table-9 ] for a phenomenologically relevant set of parameters ) .",
    "before this epoch @xmath81 changes sign and the time near this sign change may be considered as the matter dominated era .",
    "although the sign change of @xmath81 occurs at a later time in this model compared to @xmath0cdm the time and the redshift of onset of the accelerated era ( i.e. @xmath294 ) are comparable with those of @xmath0cdm .",
    "there is an epoch before the matter dominated era where @xmath81 is on average close to @xmath83 , and may be identified by radiation dominated era , and the time of the maximum value of @xmath81 may be considered as the time when the universe was like stiff matter or denser ( as in the cores of stars ) .",
    "then @xmath81 changes sign again reaches to two minima peaks as mentioned before and eventually approaches to -1 as time goes to zero ( due to the @xmath59 , in particular the first part of it ) and this epoch probably may be considered as the inflationary era .",
    "moreover the model is able to give relatively small reduced @xmath178 and @xmath90 values for union2.1 data set , and it can , at least roughly , account for recombination and nucleosynthesis times .",
    "i think this is a sufficiently well starting point for a toy model whose main aim is to embody the creation of matter and radiation in the scale factor of robertson - walker metric .",
    "however there is a great deal of points to be clarified and addressed in future studies such as checking the whole parameter space of this model by using a more elaborate software and to use more powerful computers that may give scan the whole parameter space in a better approximation than the one given here , and considering a more detailed analysis of the recombination and nucleosynthesis epochs , studying the evolution of cosmological perturbations in this model , and considering possible extensions of this model towards a more realistic model .",
    "in this study a scheme for obtaining a scale factor ( in robertson - walker metric ) that may account for the times before , during , and after the radiation dominated eras is introduced .",
    "the prescription to obtain the scale factor in this model is quite simple ; first one introduces a scale factor for the pure dark sector , and then the full scale factor is obtained by a relation between these two scale factors .",
    "the result is a scheme to produce the scale factor for the whole universe , including baryonic matter , radiation , and dark energy - matter ( i.e. dark sector ) in such a way that the times before , during , and after radiation dominated era are expressed by a single scale factor in robertson - walker metric .",
    "different choices of the pure dark sector scale factor ( denoted by @xmath10 in this paper ) and different choices of the relation between @xmath4 and the scale factor of the full universe , @xmath16 give different models . as an illustration of this scheme a model with a specific scale factor for the pure dark sector and a specific relation between @xmath4 and @xmath16 is considered .",
    "the phenomenological viability of this model is checked through its compatibility with union2.1 data set , and with recombination and nucleosynthesis by using trial error and mathematica software for almost randomly chosen sets of parameters .",
    "two sets of parameters with relatively small @xmath90 values for union2.1 data set , and that are compatible with successful recombination and nucleosynthesis at an order of magnitude level are found .",
    "these results are encouraging in view of the fact that only a tiny portion of the whole parameter space could be considered in this way .",
    "a separate , detailed , and comprehensive computational project with more advanced software codes and/or powerful computing facilities that may scan the full parameter space and may employ better approximation schemes is needed to reach a definite view on the observational viability of this scheme and/or this model .",
    "moreover the effect of this model on cosmological perturbations should be considered and possible implications and extensions of this scheme to inflationary era should be studied in future . furthermore different pure dark sector scale factors and different options to relate pure dark sector and the full universe scale factors may be considered in future to see the full range of possibilities that this scheme may offer .",
