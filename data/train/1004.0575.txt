    "over the past few years there has been a growing interest in the investigation of possible high - energy quantum - gravity - induced deviations from lorentz invariance , that would induce modifications of the energy - momentum dispersion ( on - shell ) relation @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis finds support in preliminary results obtained in some popular approaches to the study of the quantum - gravity problem , most notably approaches based on  spacetime noncommutativity \" @xcite or inspired by  loop quantum gravity \"  @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the scale governing such deviations from lorentz symmetry is the scale where the same frameworks predict a breakdown of the familiar description of spacetime geometry , the  quantum - gravity energy scale \" , here denoted by @xmath0 , which should be roughly of the order of the planck scale ( @xmath1 ev ) .    while the study of particles with energies close to the planck scale is far beyond our reach in particle - physics laboratories and even in astrophysical observatories , it is possible to look for the minute effects that planck - scale deviations from lorentz symmetry produce for particles with energies much lower than the planck scale . from this perspective of the search of small leading - order corrections",
    ", some astrophysical phenomena could provide meaningful insight , by either producing signals of the modified dispersion , or alternatively , providing constraints on the relevant models .",
    "indeed , astronomical observations have already set valuable limits on these leading - order corrections and as such on some of the alternative scenarios for  quantum gravity \" .",
    "most insightful are the studies based on the high - energy modifications of particle speeds @xcite and on the modifications to high - energy reaction thresholds ( as relevant for the ultra - high - energy cosmic - rays or very - high - energy @xmath2-rays ) @xcite .",
    "the rapid development of astronomical instrumentation over the last years has improved significantly our ability to test these scenarios .",
    "in particular the recent results of the fermi telescope collaboration @xcite , using a time - of - flight analysis of a short gamma - ray burst grb090510 , achieved a sensitivity to planck - scale effects and set for the first time a limit of @xmath3 ( for the case of effects introduced linearly in the quantum - gravity scale , defined below as @xmath4 ) .    the conceptual perspective that guides these studies is consistent with the history of other symmetries in physics , which were once thought to be fundamental but eventually turned out to be violated .",
    "there is no essential reason to believe that lorentz symmetry will be spared from this fate .",
    "if the symmetry is broken at a scale @xmath0 , we should expect leading - order corrections to arise even at much lower energies , and hence it is just natural to explore their possible implications .",
    "however , in view of the importance of lorentz symmetry in the logical consistency of our present formulation of the laws of physics , one should ask which modified dispersion relations can be placed into a viable and consistent theory ?",
    "the analysis presented here intends to contribute in this direction .",
    "we investigate this question from a rather general perspective , aware of the fact that it is quantum - gravity research that provides the key motivation for these studies , but also in principle open to the possibility that the conjectured modifications of the dispersion relation might have different origin .",
    "we consider a generic  low - energy \" , @xmath5 , leading - order modification of the dispersion relation of the form : is here introduced only for the consistency of @xmath0 in the description of speeds with the analogous parameter most commonly used in the relevant literature . ]",
    "@xmath6 the power of this leading correction , @xmath7 , and the parameter @xmath0 are model - dependent and should be determined experimentally .",
    "the conventional speed of light constant , @xmath8 , remains here the low - energy limit of massless particles speed , and we put hereafter @xmath9 ( with the exception of only a few formulas where we reinstate it for clarity ) .",
    "notice that the fact that we work in leading order in the planck - scale corrections allows us to exchange the ( modulus of ) momentum of a photon with its energy in all planck - scale suppressed terms .",
    "the modification of the dispersion relation produces a difference between energy and momentum of a photon , but this is itself a first - order correction and taking it into account in terms that are already suppressed by the smallness of the planck scale would amount to including subleading terms .",
    "the approach based on ( [ lidform ] ) , which is adopted here , has been considered by many authors as the natural entry point to the phenomenology of lorentz invariance violation @xcite .",
    "we are mainly concerned with the conceptual implications of such modifications of the dispersion relation for the way in which the same phenomenon is observed in different reference frames , and for our exploratory purposes it is sufficient to focus on ( [ lidform ] ) .",
    "our results apply to all cases in which ( [ lidform ] ) is satisfied to leading order .",
    "the findings should apply also to scenarios with birefringence , which could be induced by planck - scale effects ( see , _ e.g. _ , ref .",
    "our results may provide a first level of intuition even for the possibility of planck - scale induced  fuzziness \" , which is the case of scenarios in which there is no systematic modification of the dispersion relation but modifications roughly of the form ( [ lidform ] ) occur randomly , affecting different particles in different ways depending on the quantum fluctuations of spacetime that they experience ( for details see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    assuming , as commonly done in the related literature  @xcite , that the standard relation @xmath10 holds , the dispersion relation ( [ lidform ] ) leads to the following energy dependence of the speed of photons : @xmath11 this is an important phenomenological prediction of the modified - dispersion scenario .",
    "this effect is the basis for the most generic tests of the lorentz - violation theories .",
    "we will consider the case of subluminal motion , corresponding to the ` - ' sign in eq .",
    "( [ lawforspeed ] ) .",
    "a similar analysis can be performed for the case with superluminal speeds .",
    "we here contemplate an experiment where two relatively boosted observers detect two photons , which are emitted simultaneously at the source but arrive separated by a delay due to their different energies according to ( [ lawforspeed ] ) .",
    "the basic idea of our study is to compare , under different theoretical scenarios , the time delay measured in the different reference frames .",
    "this primarily serves as a gedanken experiment that establishes features which modified - dispersion models must include in order to have a consistent scenario .",
    "we show that if in all reference frames photons have a dispersion relation as in ( [ lidform ] ) and a speed law as in ( [ lawforspeed ] ) ( with fixed frame - independent parameters ) , then assuming the transformations between frames are governed by the standard lorentz laws would lead to a contradiction between the measurements of the different observers .",
    "this is expected , but we use our explicit derivation to deduce other requirements the models must fulfill for a solution .",
    "we consider two classes of modified - dispersion models .",
    "the first class consists of theories where the lorentz symmetry is broken ( lsb ) with the existence of a preferred inertial frame ( sometimes attributed to the cosmic microwave background frame ) .",
    "the small - scale structure and hence high - energy behavior is defined in this reference frame .",
    "therefore , the dispersion relation is allowed to take different forms in other frames . in the following",
    "we will consider only the most common lsb theories in which the lorentz transformations are still applicable when going from one frame to another .",
    "the second class of models describes a scenario where the lorentz symmetry is merely deformed , such that the equivalence of all inertial observers is maintained .",
    "this means that the lorentz symmetry makes way for a more complex symmetry , but the theory is still relativistic ( there is no preferred reference frame ) .",
    "these are called  doubly special relativity \" ( dsr ) models . within this scenario",
    "the laws of transformation are necessarily modified from the standard lorentz transformations .",
    "this is done in such a way that all observers agree on the physical laws , including the energy - momentum dispersion relation .",
    "not all models of dsr predict energy - dependent velocities of photons , but we deal with the analysis of the common dsr framework where the velocities behave as in ( [ lawforspeed ] ) .",
    "this is to say that we will have two complementary scenarios - lsb with standard lorentz transformations but allowing for departures between the dispersion relations in different frames , and dsr where the theory is frame - independent but the transformations between reference frames differ from the lorentz ones .",
    "we observe that the large effort recently devoted to the phenomenology of modifications to lorentz invariance has focused on analyses performed in a single frame .",
    "we believe that deeper insight on the fate of the lorentz symmetry can be gained by also investigating how the same phenomenon is viewed by two different observers .",
    "we argue that our study sheds light on several conceptual issues , which in turn may well provide guidance even for the ongoing effort utilizing the standard ",
    "laboratory frame \" tools .",
    "we obtain definitive results for our lsb scenario , and for the dsr case we find that some non - classical features of spacetime are required ( while the phenomenological dsr results are severely conditioned by our restrictive assumption of a classical - spacetime implementation ) . in principle",
    "( and perhaps one day in practice , after a lorentz - violating effect is observed in one frame ) our description of the effects of the lsb scenario for observations of the same phenomenon in two reference frames with a relative boost could be even exploited experimentally . in spite of the limitations associated with the assumption of a classical - spacetime implementation for the dsr case , our findings for",
    "the comparison between the lsb scenario and the dsr scenario provide some encouragement for the possibility that our scheme could also be exploited to discriminate between these alternative spacetime - propagation models .",
    "we turn now to the comparison between different observers which is the key point in our analysis .",
    "let us start by stressing that we shall focus for simplicity on flat ( minkowskian ) spacetime .",
    "while in actual studies of astronomical signals the cosmological curvature can play a significant quantitative role in the actual time delay  @xcite , we are here mainly concerned with a conceptual analysis and curvature will not change our qualitative results .    in a flat spacetime it follows immediately from ( [ lawforspeed ] ) that two photons with energies @xmath12 and @xmath13 , emitted simultaneously by a distant source , will not reach the observer simultaneously . for a source at distance @xmath14 from the observer",
    ", one should find a difference in arrival times at the detector given by : @xmath15 clearly then , if the time of arrival of a low - energy photon is @xmath16 , the time of arrival of a photon with high energy @xmath17 will be @xmath18 .",
    "we are interested in the comparison between the measurements of the same photons , emitted from a distant source , by two observers , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , in relative motion .",
    "we consider a photon of low energy @xmath12 and a photon of high energy @xmath13 .",
    "in addition to the mentioned assumption of flat spacetime , we assume that the two photons are emitted simultaneously from a single spacetime point . for simplicity",
    "we consider a source , @xmath21 , at rest with respect to the observer @xmath19 .",
    "we denote by @xmath22 the spatial distance from the source as measured by @xmath19 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath24 and @xmath25 the position coordinates of the source and the detector respectively , and we denote by @xmath26 the relative speed between observers @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the two observers are at the same spacetime point , where the faster photon reaches both of them , so they are synchronized there , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath27 at @xmath28 .",
    "we also implicitly assume that the synchronization of clocks between the two observers is essentially standard : they would perform clock synchronization using low - energy photons , which are practically unaffected by the modification of the dispersion relation .        in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] one can see the space - time diagrams in the two reference frames , the first at rest with respect to @xmath29 and the second at rest with respect to @xmath30 .",
    "only the case in which @xmath20 is moving away from @xmath21 is depicted , but in the formulas a `` @xmath31 '' in front of @xmath26 will clarify , where needed , that the formulas are valid also in the case in which @xmath20 is moving towards @xmath21 .",
    "each observer measures the delay in the time of arrival of the photon @xmath13 with respect to the photon @xmath12 in its own reference system .",

    "the formula can be used to relate the results of time - delay measurements performed by the two observers @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "this will impose limits on the free parameters , the speed law in the reference frame @xmath20 and the laws of transformation between observers .",
    "regarding the boost transformation that acting on @xmath46 gives @xmath45 , we can write : @xmath47 = \\delta t_{i } \\left ( \\frac{v(e_2)}{v(e_2 ) \\mp \\beta } \\right ) , \\ ] ] where we denoted formally by @xmath48 the action of the ( inverse ) boost that takes from @xmath20 to @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath49 reduces to the lorentz transformation in the case of lorentz invariance , and if the photons speed is independent of energy this condition is trivially satisfied .",
    "@xmath49 is also the usual lorentz transformation in our analysis of lsb .",
    "however , it takes a more general form in the case of dsr . the relation ( [ conscondboost ] ) should be viewed as a requirement of logical consistency : if all the assumptions we have made hold and there exist modified dispersion laws and a transformation action @xmath49 , then inevitably they must be connected through ( [ conscondboost ] ) .      if the speed of photons depends on their energy , but we keep the classical transformation laws between observers unmodified , it is easy to see that the law giving the quantitative dependence of the speed of photons on energy must be observer - dependent .",
    "we demonstrate explicitly in this subsection that if @xmath49 is the standard lorentz transformation action and both @xmath44 and @xmath45 obeyed the same frame - independent but energy - dependent speed law , the consistency condition would not be met .",
    "this derivation with lorentz transformations will then be used in sec .",

    "we use this to rewrite eq .",
    "( [ conscond ] ) as follows : @xmath52 next we notice that in this equation @xmath44 is of order @xmath53 ( clearly it must be the case that @xmath54 if @xmath55 ) .",
    "therefore , for an analysis in leading order of @xmath53 , where we also assume @xmath56 , it is possible to take @xmath57 on the right - hand - side of ( [ jocz ] ) : @xmath58 where we denoted by @xmath59 the relativistic doppler factor .    equation ( [ deltat2primobroken ] ) gives the time delay @xmath45 that @xmath20 must observe for consistency with the time delay @xmath60 seen by @xmath19 .",
    "we should describe @xmath45 in terms of quantities measured by @xmath20 itself , so that we can investigate the form of the time - delay formula according to @xmath20 on the basis of the form postulated for @xmath19 .",

    "accordingly , we can handle @xmath22 as the space component of a light - cone vector ( that is the vector connecting the point with space - time coordinates @xmath67 to the point with coordinates @xmath68 , see fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ) , and so it also transforms through the doppler factor : @xmath69 the same conclusion is of course drawn if we observe that according to @xmath30 the distance between @xmath21 and @xmath19 is @xmath70 ( standard lorentz contraction of the proper length @xmath22 ) , but in order to obtain @xmath66 ( the distance traveled by the photon according to @xmath30 - the distance between @xmath30 and @xmath21 at emission ) one must consider also the distance that according to @xmath30 the source @xmath21 travels during the time @xmath71 : @xmath72 in agreement with ( [ jocv ] ) .",
    "substituting ( [ jocu ] ) and ( [ jocv ] ) in ( [ jocw ] ) , we can finally describe the time delay seen by observer @xmath30 in terms of other quantities measured by @xmath30 : @xmath73 comparing ( [ delo ] ) with ( [ sec2final ] ) , we see that in such a scenario the speed law is not frame - independent .",
    "the modified dispersion relation is inconsistent with keeping the two familiar ingredients of frame independence and lorentz transformation laws .",
    "we have to abandon at least one of these appealing notions in order to have a consistent solution .",
    "the following sections discuss two different scenarios that can achieve consistency by allowing for these additional departures from special - relativity : ( i ) breaking the symmetry and having a  preferred - frame scenario \" ( sec .",
    "[ lsbsec ] ) or ( ii ) modifying the lorentz transformations ( sec .",
    "[ dsrsec ] ) .",
    "we have found that if we use the standard lorentz transformations , we necessarily reach a lsb  preferred - frame scenario \" .",
    "this means that in principle the theory could be formulated in one chosen frame of reference ( typically one where the laws take an appealingly simple form ) and then all other observers see the  lorentz - transformed image \" of the fundamental laws written in the preferred frame .",
    "this is indeed the conceptual perspective adopted in the most studied lorentz - invariance - violation models , where the scale @xmath0 in ( [ lawforspeed ] ) is expected to take different values for different observers .",
    "it is valuable to establish how exactly the laws change form in going from one reference frame to another , since this is the only way to combine the results of experiments performed by different observers .",
    "the result of the previous derivation turned out to provide a quantitative characterization of the frame dependence of the lsb scenario .",
    "we shall here continue that derivation , aware that it must be viewed in the context of an observer - dependent framework , and obtain further characterizations of the consistent broken - symmetry scenario .    according to the analysis of sec .",
    "[ clasanalsec ] , if we assume that the lorentz transformations hold and in a certain ( preferred ) frame the speed of photons behaves as in ( [ lawforspeed ] ) , the photon speed law must be quantitatively different for relatively boosted observers .",
    "the result ( [ sec2final ] ) , derived on the basis of our logical - consistency requirement , implies that starting from the speed law @xmath74 in a frame @xmath19 , one arrives at the following speed law in a frame @xmath30 : @xmath75 we therefore have an explicit characterization of the expected change of the in - vacuo - dispersion between reference frames .",
    "the laws in @xmath19 and in @xmath20 have the same functional form , but they differ quantitatively with the addition of the doppler factor parameter in @xmath20 .",
    "this parameter is determined in each frame by its relative speed with respect to the privileged frame - for any observer it is fixed and the addition is just a numerical constant .",
    "this allows us to treat the difference between observers as a variation in the scale of symmetry - breaking - marking with @xmath0 the scale as measured by @xmath19 , one then finds that the scale as measured by @xmath20 is : @xmath76 this definitive description of the quantum - gravity - scale transformation is in itself an important characterization .",
    "it is especially noteworthy as several authors had expected ( see , _ e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) that @xmath77 should be treated as a length scale , subject to standard lorentz - fitzgerald contraction . equation ( [ jocccc ] ) shows that this is not the case .",
    "another potentially valuable characterization is found upon recalling the assumption that the energy dependence of the speed of photons , ( [ lawforspeed ] ) , is describable as the group velocity of photons governed by a deformed dispersion relation : @xmath78 we now deduce from eq .",
    "( [ lawforspeedprimebroken ] ) with @xmath79 , that in the reference system of @xmath20 the dispersion relation takes the form : @xmath80 here on the right - hand - side we have highlighted a peculiar consequence of the law of transformation of the scale @xmath0 .",
    "its net result is that , for a given photon ( of given energy @xmath17 according to observer @xmath19 ) , the violation of the special - relativistic dispersion relation , @xmath81 , has exactly the same magnitude for all observers .",
    "this magnitude is fixed by the formula for the lorentz - violating term in the preferred frame , which is based on the photon energy @xmath17 , measured in that frame : @xmath82 any observer can compute the lorentz - violating term of the dispersion relation by finding the  special \" energy @xmath17 , according to its boost relative to @xmath19 , and using the same formula .",
    "we have evidently found , in the context of our frame - dependent scenario , an invariant term , which has the form of a mass term in special - relativity .",
    "we stress that obviously this invariant @xmath83 can not be viewed as an  effective mass for photons in the lsb scenario \" , as already implied by the fact that the speed law ( [ lawforspeedprimebroken ] ) is not obtained by treating @xmath84 as a mass in the ultrarelativistic limit : is found by observing that @xmath83 is an invariant under passive lorentz transformations but not an invariant under active lorentz transformations , something that is not at all surprising for cases where lorentz symmetry is broken . under passive boosts that establish how the properties of the same particle are measured by different observers",
    ", we have indeed found that @xmath83 is an invariant .",
    "of course the observation reported in ( [ jocjoc ] ) simply reflects the evident fact that @xmath83 is not invariant under active boosts , which for a single observer map a particle of energy @xmath12 into a different particle of energy @xmath13 .",
    "another example of corrections that are invariant under passive lorentz transformations but not invariant under active lorentz transformations is the case of correction terms of the form @xmath85 , with @xmath86 some  external \" lorentz - symmetry - breaking vector and @xmath87 the four - momentum of the particles : under a passive boost , of course , both @xmath86 and @xmath87 would transform in a way just such @xmath85 is left invariant , but under an active boost only @xmath87 is transformed and the term @xmath85 changes its value . ]",
    "@xmath88 of course , a generic correction @xmath83 to the dispersion relation will affect inertia in the way prescribed for mass only if , unlike our @xmath83 , it is independent of energy - momentum ( so that it would provide inertia in standard fashion in the group - velocity calculation , obtained by @xmath89 ) .",
    "one similarity between our case and the analogy of a massive - particle dispersion is that in transforming to a reference frame where the energy of the particle is smaller , the effect of the correction to @xmath90 becomes larger .",
    "this result for the case of lsb comes in contrast to the intuition , by which the phenomenological effect of lorentz invariance violation should become more significant when a particle has a larger energy which is closer to the quantum - gravity scale .    in conclusion , regarding the much - studied quantum - gravity scenario of a high - energy breakdown of lorentz symmetry with the emergence of a preferred frame",
    ", we have formulated explicitly the only allowed form of the modified dispersion relation , which is consistent with the lorentz transformations . to have a quantitative appreciation of the phenomenological effect of the lorentz - violating speed law in different reference frames , we observe again the result , ( [ deltat2primobroken ] ) , obtained for the time delay that would be measured in a general frame . for observations made from different reference frames with a relative speed @xmath26",
    ", the time delays between the photons will differ by a factor of the corresponding @xmath91 . since the difference between the reference frames is not suppressed by another power of @xmath92 ( but only by the smallness of the relative speed ) , it may in principle be an observed phenomenon .",
    "as an example , we may consider a detector moving at a speed of @xmath93 km / s ( the speed of nasa s helios 2 satellite , which was launched in the 1970s ) : @xmath94 ( when the detector is moving away from the photons ) .",
    "this means that if , for instance , a detector at  rest \" measures a lorentz - violation - induced time delay of @xmath95 s ( which the fermi telescope can measure if indeed a @xmath4 effect exists ) , the moving detector will measure a time delay greater by @xmath96 ms .",
    "this is small but not unrealistic to expect a possible test in the future .",
    "note that our result is that in the lsb context the time delay in the moving frame is larger even though the photons measured energies are lower .",
    "this is in contrast to the intuitive expectation of a smaller time delay in a frame where the photon energy is smaller ( see sec .",
    "[ closingsec ] for further discussion ) .",
    "a different scenario , which has recently generated interest - the dsr scenario , was essentially introduced  @xcite to explore the possibility that the quantum - gravity scale may affect the laws of transformation between observers while preserving the relativistic nature of the theory ( no preferred frame ) . within this dsr scenario the departures from ordinary lorentz invariance",
    "would take the shape of a  deformation \" ( rather than breakdown ) of symmetries .",
    "this can be thought of in a close analogy with the transition from galilean invariance to lorentz invariance .",
    "galilean invariance ensures the equivalence of inertial observers but makes no room for observer - independent relativistically - non - trivial scales .",
    "attempts to accommodate a maximum - speed law first relied on scenarios that would break galilean symmetry ( ether ) , but eventually found proper formulation in the shape of a deformation of galilean invariance .",
    "this formulation is lorentz invariance , which is still without a preferred frame , but the laws of transformation between inertial observers are deformed ( with respect to the galilean case ) in such a way that a velocity scale , setting the speed - of - light maximum value , is observer - independent .",
    "the dsr framework makes another step with a deformation of lorentz invariance that introduces an additional observer - independent scale .",
    "the aim here is exploring the possibility that the existence of a short - distance ( high - energy ) relativistically - invariant scale might eventually become manifest as we probe high - energy regimes more sensitively , just like the presence of a relativistic velocity scale becomes manifest in accurate observations of high - velocity particles .",
    "we are interested in considering the case of dsr models in which the new observer - independent law is a law of in - vacuo dispersion , based on a relativistic energy scale .",
    "this will offer us a framework for investigation which is complementary to our lsb case . in the lsb scenario",
    "one assumes the laws of transformation to remain unchanged , allowing for an observer - dependent scale of in - vacuo dispersion , while in a dsr scenario with in - vacuo dispersion one must insist on observer independence of the scale of in - vacuo dispersion , allowing the laws of transformation between observers to take a new form .",
    "our analysis is somewhat limited by the fact that these dsr scenarios are still  work in progress \" . among the residual grey areas for a dsr description of in - vacuo dispersion",
    "particularly significant for our purposes are the ones concerning the description of spacetime . in the following we assume a classical - spacetime geometry , within which we adopt , as done by most authors in the field  @xcite , concepts such as spacetime points , translational symmetries , energy , momentum and group velocity in the familiar manner .",
    "we find , below , that in - vacuo dispersion of the form ( [ lidform ] ) is inconsistent with dsr in such a classical spacetime .",
    "this provides new and particularly strong elements in favor of a non - classical spacetime picture .",
    "these findings are consistent with several independent arguments giving indirect evidence of the necessity to adopt a novel ,  quantum \" , picture of spacetime ( see , _ e.g. _ , refs .",
    "in such a quantum spacetime the sharp absolute concept of spacetime would be lost , and in particular one might have that two events that are simultaneous at the same spatial point for one observer are not simultaneous for another observer . however , a satisfactory picture of such a quantum spacetime has not yet been found .",
    "the dsr side of our analysis also intriguingly suggests that quantitatively important differences can be found between the lsb and dsr cases when a single phenomenon is observed from two different reference frames .",
    "while clearly conditioned by our restrictive assumptions , and therefore subject to further scrutiny in future dsr studies , the magnitude of the effect is large enough that it would be surprising if more refined analyses removed it completely .",
    "we shall argue that this might open the way to a future test for the discrimination between alternative in - vacuo dispersion scenarios ( provided that in - vacuo dispersion is detected ) .",
    "we proceed , inspecting the possibility of the dsr scenario with in - vacuo dispersion , using the logical - consistency criterion derived earlier .",
    "we here consider the difference in time delays seen by two observers as a result of in - vacuo dispersion in the dsr case .",
    "of course , as long as we consider a single observer there is no distinction between lsb - case and dsr - case in - vacuo dispersion , and also in the dsr scenario we have for observer @xmath19 : @xmath97 the differences between the lsb and dsr scenarios are instead very significant for what concerns the relationship between this formula for observer @xmath19 and the corresponding formula for an observer @xmath20 boosted with respect to @xmath19 .",
    "we now start from the axiom of our dsr scenario , that @xmath0 is an observer - independent scale and the speed law of photons is identical in all reference frames .",
    "this is in contrast to the property of the lsb case that enabled a consistent scenario . here ,",
    "we seek a consistent description through a new form of transformation laws between observers . )",
    "the transformations should converge to the standard lorentz transformations , and in leading order there would be some correction term with @xmath53 .",
    "] exploiting the observer independence of the speed law ( [ lawforspeed ] ) , we directly arrive at the time delay measured by observer @xmath20 : @xmath98    the measurements in the different reference frames , ( [ deltat1joc ] ) and ( [ deltat2primopreservedshort ] ) , have to be related through the criterion ( [ conscondboost ] ) for consistency .",
    "this clearly requires a departure from the standard lorentz transformations . for the purpose of comparing @xmath44 and @xmath45 we should re - express the formula ( [ deltat2primopreservedshort ] ) in terms of energies and distances measured by observer @xmath19 .",
    "we should , generally , write the relations between @xmath22 and @xmath66 and between @xmath17 and @xmath63 with a correction to the lorentz transformations .",

    "@xmath100 utilizing now the consistency criterion , @xmath101 we arrive at a formulation of the connection between the time interval @xmath46 and its transformation to the frame of observer @xmath20 : @xmath102 = \\mathcal{d}^{n+1 } ( 1 \\mp \\beta ) \\delta t_{ii } + \\mathcal{o}\\left(e_{qg}^{-2n}\\right ) .\\ ] ]    this last result poses an immediate challenge for the consistency of this scenario .",
    "the corresponding formula for the lorentz transformation of the proper time @xmath45 is : @xmath103 it is obvious that the expression ( [ dsrtranslawdeltat2 ] ) can not be a leading - order correction of ( [ srref ] ) .",
    "the crucial observation is that the difference between the transformation laws of ( [ dsrtranslawdeltat2 ] ) and ( [ srref ] ) is of zeroth order , _",
    "i.e. _ it is not proportional to any powers of @xmath104 . in our analysis",
    "we tried to meet the consistency requirement by allowing for some deformations of the transformation laws , such that at zeroth order the dsr transformations are the same as the special - relativistic ones .",
    "however , higher - order corrections of the transformations were not relevant in our derivation , which consisted only of quantities which are already suppressed by @xmath53 .",
    "since the only essential assumption that was used to derive this paradoxical result concerned the classicality of spacetime geometry , we conclude that there can not be any consistent classical - spacetime formulation of dsr with modified dispersion",
    ".      the comparison of ( [ dsrtranslawdeltat2 ] ) and ( [ srref ] ) allowed us to conclude , consistently with indications that emerged in previous dsr studies @xcite , but in our opinion more forcefully than in any previous related investigation , that a classical - spacetime formulation of dsr models with energy - dependent photon velocity can be excluded .",
    "we must either adopt a dsr framework with no energy - dependent photon dispersion or alternatively consider non - classical features of the dsr spacetime , such that there is no classical - algebraic - description of the transformations of spacetime coordinates between reference frames .",
    "instead the transition to dsr should be one that involves a change to the nature of spacetime .",
    "it is , indeed , not very surprising to find a contradiction between the implications of the dsr framework and the properties of classical spacetime , since the quantum - gravity motivation for dsr research is strongly related to the concept of  quantum spacetime \" .",
    "a quantum description of spacetime entails dramatic modifications to common features of spacetime geometry that are intuitive in our classical description .",
    "the sharp observer - independent identification of an event ( a spacetime point ) is not available in a quantum spacetime .",
    "instead we have some  fuzziness \" .",
    "the new geometry will have a fundamentally different structure .",
    "for example , a popular quantum - gravity - inspired description of these spacetimes relies on the formalism of  spacetime noncommutativity \" , where the coordinates of an event are described in terms of a set of noncommuting observables , governed for example by noncommutativity of the type @xmath105 = i { \\cal c}^\\alpha_{\\mu \\nu } \\frac{x_\\alpha}{e_{qg}}$ ] , with @xmath106 a model - dependent dimensionless matrix . among other approaches that resist the temptation of characterizing spacetime nonclassicality in terms of coordinates ,",
    "one of the most popular is the  rainbow metric \" picture proposed in @xcite , which essentially characterizes the nonclassicality of spacetime in terms of a metric tensor which is perceived differently by particles of different energy .",
    "this formalization attempts to also find support in some results obtained through direct analysis of dsr scenarios with in - vacuo dispersion .",
    "in particular , it is known  @xcite that observer - independent modifications of the dispersion relation for massive particles are inconsistent with a classical - spacetime picture .",
    "this is seen considering the case of two particles of masses @xmath107 and @xmath108 with the same velocity according to some observer @xmath19 .",
    "the observer @xmath19 could see two particles with different masses and different energies moving at the same speed and following the same trajectory ( for @xmath19 particles @xmath109 and @xmath110 are  near \" at all times ) , but , taking into account the dsr - deformed laws of transformation between observers @xcite , the same two particles would have different velocities according to a second observer @xmath20 ( so according to @xmath20 they could be  near \" only for a limited amount of time ) .",
    "this would clearly be a manifestation of spacetime nonclassicality , since it amounts to stating that a single spacetime point for @xmath19 is mapped into two ( possibly sizeably distant ) points for @xmath20 .",
    "the results so far obtained in this section provide a novel characterization of the  virulence \" of the modification of spacetime structure required by dsr scenarios with in - vacuo dispersion .",
    "our findings confirm previous indications in support of the idea that these scenarios require a _ soft deformation _ of energy - momentum space but a rather drastic change in the description of spacetime .",
    "with respect to previous studies that provided support for similar characterizations , our analysis contributes a perspective centered on time measurements , whereas earlier works  @xcite had focused mainly on spatial - position measurements .",
    "accordingly , our findings , particularly the form of eq .",
    "( [ dsrtranslawdeltat2 ] ) , could provide motivation for further investigation of the definition of time in dsr scenarios .",
    "already in some of the first dsr studies  @xcite it was realized that several subtle issues may affect such a definition of time , but these challenges have not been pursued further .",
    "regarding the peculiar properties of quantum spacetime , of particular relevance for our analysis is the concept of simultaneity .",
    "special relativity removes the abstraction of an  absolute time \" , but still affords us an objective , observer - independent , concept of simultaneity for events occurring at the same spatial point . in a quantum - spacetime setting",
    ", however , events which are simultaneous and at the same spatial point for a certain observer are not necessarily simultaneous for another observer  @xcite .",
    "this is easily seen by noticing that most models of spacetime quantization are inspired by the quantization of ( position - velocity ) phase space in ordinary quantum mechanics , where the heisenberg principle obstructs the possibility of two particles objectively having the same  position \" in phase space ( they can not have sharp values of both position and velocity , so they can not even be attributed sharply to a point of phase space in a classical sense ) .",
    "indeed , the related concept of a  generalized uncertainty principle \" , introducing an absolute limitation to combined sharp determinations of both position and time of an event , has been introduced in most approaches to the spacetime quantization  @xcite .",
    "the fact that simultaneity at the same spatial point might no longer be observer - independent exposes a possibly important limitation of the applicability of our classical - spacetime analysis to a non - classical spacetime : it was in fact crucial for our line of reasoning that we assumed that for both observer @xmath19 and observer @xmath20 the emission of the two photons by the ( point - like ) source was simultaneous .",
    "while this does not weaken our conclusion that only quantum - spacetime formulations of dsr are admissible , it might weaken the insight on properties of these quantum spacetimes that our analysis also provides .",
    "naively one might think that the needed quantum spacetimes should necessarily match our result ( [ dsrtranslawdeltat2 ] ) , but spacetime classicality was assumed in deriving ( [ dsrtranslawdeltat2 ] ) .",
    "therefore it is too restrictive to insist precisely on ( [ dsrtranslawdeltat2 ] ) , if the analysis we here reported is ever generalized to the case of ( some example of ) quantum spacetime .",
    "actually we feel that this is the direction where our analysis provides the most serious challenge ( and perhaps even an opportunity ) for dsr research : while it is true that the paradox we highlighted is not necessarily applicable to quantum - spacetime scenarios , it is clearly at this point necessary to address this issue within some specific quantum - spacetime picture and in explicit physical fashion .",
    "some explicit candidate quantum - spacetime pictures for dsr with energy - dependent speed of massless particles have been proposed  @xcite , but their analysis has not gone much further than the merely abstract / mathematical level , whereas we here showed that a serious challenge ( possibly excluding some or even all of these candidates ) will be met only upon a fully physical formulation of these concepts of spacetime quantization .",
    "we have analyzed in this work two scenarios of departures from lorentz invariance .",
    "demanding the consistency of observations in different reference frames , we arrived at a characterization of the requirements from each scenario . both scenarios require a costly departure from the present formulation of the laws of physics . for lsb",
    "we have the emergence of a  privileged rest frame \" in which @xmath0 is defined and measured ( and in all other frames we find that @xmath0 is given by a specific non - trivial transformation ) . for dsr",
    "we find no classical solution to the consistency problem , as we have shown that the required transformation laws between boosted frames do not yield the lorentz transformations as a limiting case .",
    "a potential resolution of the paradox is the departure from a classical spacetime and the possible emergence of apparently paradoxical spacetime nonclassicality .",
    "the current literature on quantum - gravity finds advocates for each of these new - physics descriptions .",
    "unfortunately , experiments of this nature , that will tell us which if any of these two possibilities should be adopted , can not be imagined at present . however , we recall the recent history of the quantum - gravity research , when , just fifteen years ago , it was not imagined that experiments would at all be able to test lorentz invariance violation at the planck scale",
    ".    still , even though an experimental test is unlikely at the immediate future , it is noteworthy what one finds by comparing the results ( [ deltat2primobroken ] ) and ( [ deltat2primopreserved ] ) , describing the behavior of the in - vacuo - dispersion - induced time delay @xmath45 measured by observer @xmath30 w.r.t .",
    "the delay @xmath60 measured by @xmath19 , as the relative speed between the two observers changes : @xmath111 in this comparison we want to stress the relevant fact that in the two cases @xmath45 behaves in the opposite way : when in the lsb case it shrinks w.r.t .",
    "@xmath60 , in the dsr case it grows , and vice - versa .",
    "if we consider again the conservative quantitative example of sec .",
    "[ lsbsec ] , we notice that even with present - day technology a possible measurement by two detectors would give a difference at a level of @xmath112 between the two scenarios in ( [ phenomcomparison ] ) .    while the result of the dsr analysis was derived in a classical - spacetime environment , which was shown to be an unfit description , it is probably safe to assume that the correct result , which may be derived when we have the full quantum - spacetime description , will admit our result as at least a rough approximation .",
    "though we do not claim here that our dsr - case formula should be trusted in detail , it appears likely that our preliminary analysis has uncovered a qualitative feature that could be robust - it might well be a valid assumption that for observables such as @xmath45 the dependence on the boost factor @xmath91 of the dsr case would differ significantly from the corresponding feature of the lsb case . and",
    "while we have concentrated here on a conceptual analysis , it is not unreasonable to imagine that if evidence of in - vacuo dispersion is ever found , a two - telescope experiment could be conducted to investigate further the departure from lorentz invariance , following the strategy of analysis we advocated here . since the contrast between the expected results of the different modified - dispersion scenarios appears to be a zeroth order effect , when the sensitivity of time - of - flight tests reaches scales above the quantum - gravity scale , such an experiment can in principle",
    "be performed .",
    "this would help establish in detail the fate of lorentz symmetry .",
