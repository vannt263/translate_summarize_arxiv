    "inspired by some aspects of string theory and loop quantum gravity , _ fuzziness _ of spacetime can be expressed using the following relation for non - commutativity of coordinate operators[1,2 ] @xmath0=i\\theta^{ij}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is a real , antisymmetric matrix , with the dimension of length squared which determines the fundamental cell discretization of spacetime manifold . as a consequence of above relation ,",
    "the notion of point in the spacetime manifold becomes obscure as there is a fundamental uncertainty in measuring the coordinates @xmath2 this finite resolution of the spacetime points especially affects the cosmological dynamics in early stages of the universe evolution . on the other hand ,",
    "inflation has been identified as a great opportunity to test theories of planck scale physics including noncommutative geometry .",
    "essentially , effects of trans - planckian physics should be observable in the cosmic microwave background radiation [ 3 - 9 ] .",
    "for this reason , various attempts to construct noncommutative inflationary models have been done by adopting various different approaches .",
    "these approaches include using relation ( 1 ) for space - space [ 10 ] and space - time [ 11 ] coordinates and constructing a noncommutative field theory on the spacetime manifold by replacing ordinary product of fields by weyl - wigner - moyal @xmath3 .",
    "another way to incorporate effects of high energy physics in inflationary models is using the generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) which is a manifestation of the existence of a fundamental length scale in the system [ 12 ] .",
    "+ recently a new approach to noncommutative inflation has been proposed by rinaldi [ 13 ] using the coherent state picture of noncommutativity introduced in [ 14 ] .",
    "this model is free from some of the problems that plagued models based on @xmath3 such as unexpected divergencies and uv / ir mixing ( see [ 15 ] for a full review ) .",
    "the key idea in this model is that noncommutativity _ smears _ the initial singularity and as a result there will be an smooth transition between pre and post big bang eras via an accelerated expansion .",
    "it has been shown that noncommutativity eliminates point - like structures in the favor of smeared objects in flat spacetime .",
    "as nicolini _",
    "have shown [ 16 ] ( see also [ 17 ] for some other extensions ) , the effect of smearing is mathematically implemented as a substitution rule : position dirac - delta function is replaced everywhere with a gaussian distribution of minimal width @xmath4 . in this framework , they have chosen the mass density of a static , spherically symmetric , smeared , particle - like gravitational source as follows @xmath5 as they have indicated , the particle mass @xmath6 , instead of being perfectly localized at a point , is diffused throughout a region of linear size @xmath4 . this is due to the intrinsic uncertainty as has been shown in the coordinate commutators ( 1 ) .",
    "recently we have constructed a noncommutative braneworld inflation scenario [ 18 ] based on the idea that initial singularity is smeared in a noncommutative background . within the same streamline ,",
    "the purpose of this letter is to study time evolution of cosmological perturbations in a braneworld inflation scenario in the context of spacetime noncommutativity .",

    "the effective field equations on the brane are derived from the gauss - codazzi equations and junction conditions ( using @xmath12-symmetry)[20,21 ] @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the high - energy correction term , which is negligible for @xmath15 , while @xmath16 is the projection of the bulk weyl tensor on the brane .",
    "the general form of the brane energy - momentum tensor for any matter fields ( scalar fields , perfect fluids , kinetic gases , dissipative fluids , etc . ) , including a combination of different fields , can be covariantly given in terms of a chosen 4-velocity @xmath17 as @xmath18 here @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the energy density and isotropic pressure and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the momentum density and anisotropic stress respectively .",

    ", momentum density and anisotropic stress can be written as [ 21 ] @xmath30 where superscript @xmath31 denotes the contribution of the bulk weyl tensor which enters the modified friedmann equation as a non - local dark radiation term . using these definitions ,",
    "the modified friedmann and raychaudhuri equations can be rewritten as @xmath32 the tracefree property of @xmath33 in equation ( 5 ) implies that the pressure obeys @xmath34 .",
    "+ the local conservation equations on the brane are [ 21 ] @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the volume expansion rate , which reduces to @xmath37 in the frw background ( @xmath38 is the background hubble rate ) , @xmath39 is the 4-acceleration , and @xmath40 is the covariant derivative in the rest space .",
    "the non - local conservation equations for the dark radiation matter can be expressed as [ 21 ] @xmath41 we now suppose that the initial singularity that leads to rs ii geometry afterwards , is smeared due to spacetime noncommutativity .",
    "a newly proposed model for the similar scenario in the usual 4d universe suggests that one could write the energy density as [ 13,18 ] @xmath42 note that we suppose that the universe enters the rs ii geometry immediately after the initial smeared singularity which is a reasonable assumption ( for instance , from a m - theory perspective of the cyclic universe this assumption seems to be reliable , see ref .

    "we define energy density and expansion perturbations as [ 26 ] using the covariant 3 + 1 analysis developed in [ 27 ] @xmath63 similarly , the perturbations in nonlocal quantities associated with the dark radiation matter are defined as @xmath64 with these definitions , the equations governing on the evolution of perturbations ( equations ( 16)-(19 ) ) will take the following forms @xmath65 \\delta \\,,\\\\ { \\dot{u } } & = & ( 3w-1)h {    u } + \\left({4c_{\\rm s}^2\\over 1+w}\\right)\\left({{\\rho^\\varepsilon } \\over\\rho}\\right ) h\\delta -\\left({4{\\rho^\\varepsilon } \\over3\\rho}\\right ) z - ad^2 { q}\\,,\\\\   { \\dot{q } } & = & ( 3w-1)h { q}-{1\\over3a } { u}-{{2\\over3 } } a { d^2\\pi}+{1\\over3 a}\\left [ \\left({4c_{\\rm s}^2\\over 1+w}\\right){{\\rho^\\varepsilon}\\over\\rho}-3(1+w ) { { \\rho\\over\\lambda}}\\right]\\delta\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 , @xmath58 and @xmath62 are given by equations ( 20 ) , ( 23 ) and ( 24 ) respectively . + in general ,",
    "scalar perturbations on the brane can not be predicted by brane observers without additional information from the bulk because there is no equation for @xmath66 in the above set of equations .",
    "nevertheless , it has been shown that on large scales one can neglect the @xmath67 term in equation ( 33 ) .",
    "so , on large scales , the system of equations closes on the brane , and brane observers can predict scalar perturbations from initial conditions intrinsic to the brane without the need to solve the bulk perturbation equations [ 26,27 ] .",

    "one should note that the subsequent evolution of the universe after times greater than a few @xmath4 should be governed by a matter content for particle creation in an expanding universe . ]",
    "different than the one used in equation ( 21 ) ( _ i.e. _ energy density of the initial singularity smeared by noncommutativity ) .",
    "so , the evolution of @xmath58 , @xmath90 and @xmath78 in the low energy regime essentially should be different .",
    "the solution ( 43 ) is valid when there is no dark radiation in the background .",
    "if @xmath91 , then one should solve the system of equations ( 37 ) and ( 38 ) using the explicit form of @xmath49 .",
    "generally the time dependence of @xmath49 for brane observer is not determined .",
    "here we introduce a possible candidate for this quantity : as we have mentioned previously , the constraint from nucleosynthesis on the value of @xmath49 is so that @xmath50 at the time of nucleosynthesis .",
    "based on this constraint , we can assume for instance that @xmath49 is a small fraction of @xmath19 at a given time .",
    "since the time evolution of @xmath19 is determined by ( 20 ) , the time evolution of @xmath49 can be supposed to be @xmath92 where @xmath93 is a small constant and less than @xmath94 .",
    "this form of @xmath95 can be used to solve the system of equations ( 37 ) and ( 38 ) explicitly .",
    "nevertheless , this procedure needs a lot of calculations with very lengthy solutions that we ignore their presentation here .",
    "+ the curvature perturbation defined in metric - based perturbation theory is @xmath96 which reduces to @xmath97 on uniform density ( @xmath98 ) hypersurfaces .",
    "if there is no dark radiation in the background ( @xmath99 ) , the total curvature perturbation on large scale is given by the following differential equation [ 24 ] @xmath100 { \\delta\\rho^{\\varepsilon } \\over ( \\rho+p)(1+\\rho/\\lambda)}\\,.\\ ] ] where @xmath101 is matter perturbation which is zero for adiabattic perturbations . since the time variation of @xmath19 , @xmath38 , @xmath20 , @xmath62 and @xmath102 are given by equations ( 20 ) , ( 21 ) , ( 22 ) , ( 24 ) and ( 39 ) respectively , we can obtain the time evolution of the curvature perturbation explicitly as follows @xmath103 @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the exponential integral defined as @xmath106 .",
    "figure @xmath107 shows the evolution of @xmath108 versus the cosmic time for both commutative and noncommutative brane inflation . for the commutative braneworld inflation",
    ", we have considered the chaotic inflation with @xmath109 and we obtained the form of @xmath110 using its relation with @xmath19 .",
    "the amplitude of perturbations in the commutative regime decays faster than the noncommutative regime with the same parameter values . as a result",
    "we need smaller number of e - folds in the noncommutative regime to have a successful braneworld inflation .",
    "spacetime noncommutativity as a trans - planckian effect , essentially could have some observable effects on the cosmic microwave background radiation . in this respect , it is desirable to study an inflation scenario within a noncommutative background .",
    "recently we have shown the possibility of realization of a non - singular , bouncing , early time cosmology in a noncommutative braneworld scenario [ 18 ] . in that work , using the smeared , coherent state picture of the spacetime noncommutativity , we have constructed a braneworld inflation that has the potential to support the scale invariant scalar perturbations . here , following our previous work ,",
    "we have studied the time evolution of the perturbations in this noncommutative braneworld setup .",
    "we have neglected the contribution of the dark radiation term ( originating in the bulk weyl tensor ) in the background geometry to have a closed set of equations on the brane .",
    "however , the contribution of this term in the evolution of perturbations on the brane are taken into account . in this way , by studying the effective quantities ( such as the effective equation of state and speed of sound ) we have realized the possibility of a phantom evolution in the early , inflationary stage of the universe history .",
