    "recent advances in optical and electron - beam lithography offered possibility to fabricate arrays of micron and submicron - size magnetic structures with controlled magnetic properties . among such structures are mesoscopic circular disks of soft ferromagnetic materials .",
    "arrays of such disks , as well as individual disks , have been intensively studied @xcite due to their unusual magnetic properties and potential for technological and biomedical applications@xcite .",
    "micron - size circular disks exhibit a wide variety of magnetic equilibrium configurations due to geometric constraints on the spin field@xcite .",
    "their applications are based on static and dynamic properties of one of the essentially non - uniform ground states , the _ vortex state_. it is characterized by the curling of the magnetization in the plane of the disk , leaving virtually no magnetic `` charges '' .",
    "the very weak uncompensated magnetic moment of the disk sticks out of a small area confined to the vortex core ( vc ) .",
    "the diameter of the core is comparable to the material exchange length@xcite .",
    "the low frequency dynamics of the vortex state is due to the gyrotropic mode , consisting of the spiral - like precessional motion of the vc as a whole@xcite , and it is intrinsically distinct from conventional spin wave excitations .    because of the strong exchange interaction among the out - of - plane spins in the vc , it behaves as an independent entity .",
    "the research on excitation modes of vortices has focused on the low - frequency gyroscopic mode that describes circular motion of the vortex about the center of the disk .",
    "it can also be viewed as the uniform precession of the magnetic moment of the disk due to the vortex .",
    "the natural question is whether the gyroscopic mode allows spatial dispersion similar to spin waves of finite wavelength in ferromagnets .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study spin waves related to the gyroscopic motion of the vortex .",
    "such a wave is shown in fig .",
    "1 . it must exist due to finite elasticity of the vortex provided by the exchange interaction .",
    "most of the research on the gyroscopic motion of vortices in circularly polarized disks ignores the inertial mass of the vc .",
    "such a mass has a dynamical origin stemming from the variation of the shape of the vc as it moves inside the disk .",
    "meantime , experimental studies of vortex oscillations in micrometer permalloy rings@xcite hinted towards a non - negligible vortex mass of order @xmath0 kg . on a theoretical side",
    "the vortex mass has been previously computed in a two - dimensional heisenberg model with anisotropic exchange interaction @xcite . in disks made of soft magnetic materials that have been experimented with ,",
    "the exchange interaction is isotropic .",
    "we will show that in this case the finite mass density of the vortex originates from the geometrical confinement of the spin field and the magnetic dipole - dipole interactions .    in this paper we will derive the generalized thiele equation that describes spin waves in the vortex core of finite mass density and will obtain the spectrum of such waves .",
    "we will show that the conventional gyroscopic mode , @xmath1 , appears as a gap in the spectrum of the spin waves in the vortex , @xmath2 , when the vortex mass is neglected . from the mathematical point of view",
    "the above problem resembles the problem of the motion of a charged string in a potential well in the presence of the magnetic field .",
    "the latter problem is a generalization of the problem of landau levels of an electron in a two - dimensional potential well in the magnetic field .",
    "we will show that this problem has a nice exact solution for quantized oscillations of the string , thus providing the spectrum of magnons in the vortex in the quantum regime as well .",
    "classical and quantum solutions for the spectrum of excitations of the vortex lead to the same dispersion law , @xmath3 , in the limit of small @xmath4 .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "ii a lagrangian formulation of the problem is presented .",
    "formal derivation of the massive elastic thiele s equation that allows deformations of the vortex line is given in section iii .",
    "the spectrum of spin waves in the vortex core is obtained in section iv .",
    "we show that a finite mass of the vortex results in the additional excitation mode that is absent in the case of zero mass . quantum mechanical treatment of magnons in the vortex core is developed in section v. the vortex mass in a circularly polarized disk",
    "is computed in sec .",
    "vi and is shown to be in good agreement with experimental findings .",
    "the field dependence of the vortex excitation modes and effects of dissipation are discussed in sec .",
    "viii contains final conclusions and suggestions for experiment .",
