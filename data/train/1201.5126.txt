    "experimentally accessible @xmath0-violating effects , such as the mixing of neutral mesons , are often resonantly enhanced .",
    "this suggests that the matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe may have emerged from resonant mixing as well .",
    "the enhancement is maximized when the mixing states are nearly degenerate in their masses and couplings .",
    "for example , resonant leptogenesis  @xcite relies on almost mass - degenerate singlet neutrinos @xmath1 , where the masses are of majorana type and violate lepton number .",
    "the degeneracy may result from an approximate global symmetry or from parametric tuning .",
    "one reason for introducing it is to allow for low reheat temperatures . barring resonant enhancement ,",
    "the observed asymmetry can only arise at temperatures above @xmath2 , which lead to the overproduction of unwanted thermal relics in some particle physics scenarios .    in the most generic realizations , the couplings of the singlet neutrinos are so small that they escape detection in colliders , even if their masses are of electroweak scale or within an experimentally accessible range above .",
    "( see , however , ref .",
    "it is therefore interesting to consider the question whether particles that are not gauge singlets can lead to a resonantly enhanced asymmetry as well .",
    "such particles could be found in collider experiments .",
    "obvious candidates are additional higgs doublets @xmath3 .",
    "these fields combine to gauge singlets with the standard model ( sm ) lepton doublets @xmath4 , such that they can couple to a singlet neutrino at the renormalizable level . due to its arbitrarily small couplings ,",
    "the singlet may deviate from equilibrium in the early universe , thus breaking @xmath5 invariance , which is necessary in order to make the @xmath0-violation needed for leptogenesis effective , what would be barred by the @xmath6-theorem otherwise .",
    "the masses and couplings of the higgs doublets do not violate lepton number , but generically violate lepton flavor .",
    "this implies that before washout , no lepton asymmetry , but only a flavor asymmetry can be generated .",
    "the flavor asymmetries suffer different amounts of washout , such that eventually , a lepton asymmetry emerges .    with the basic mechanism outlined , its quantitative description should address the following key questions :    * concerning @xmath0-violation from mixing , the higgs doublets assume the role of the singlet neutrinos in conventional leptogenesis .",
    "gauge interactions keep these doublets close to thermal equilibrium .",
    "the deviation from equilibrium is mediated by loops involving the singlet neutrinos .",
    "does this induce a @xmath0-violating bias in the production of leptons ? to answer this , an analysis with accurate account for real intermediate states must be performed . for this purpose , we use the closed - time - path ( ctp ) formalism .",
    "the lepton production rate follows from the imaginary part of the diagram in figure  [ fig : sigellcpv ] , and the correct counting of real and virtual states is incorporated automatically  @xcite .",
    "* when the masses of the extra doublets @xmath3 are of electroweak or @xmath7 scale and @xmath1 is much heavier , the relevant cut that corresponds to the process @xmath8 is kinematically forbidden in the vacuum . in a thermal background",
    "however , it receives contributions from the distribution functions of @xmath1 and @xmath4 .",
    "again , this can be reliably calculated using ctp methods . * the resonance for",
    "almost degenerate higgs - doublets should be limited by their widths .",
    "we show that the relevant contributions arise from higgs - flavor violating yukawa and scalar self - interactions , while the universal flavor conserving gauge interactions do not limit the resonant enhancement .",
    "note that a partial cancellation of the widths that limit the enhancement is familiar from conventional resonant leptogenesis  @xcite .",
