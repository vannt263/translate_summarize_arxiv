    "_ @xcite and huse @xcite pointed out , using renormalization group techniques and numerical calculations , respectively , that there is universality and scaling behavior even at an early stage of the time evolution of dynamic systems without conserved order parameter ( model a in the terminology of halperin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "since then , a great deal of works on phase transitions and critical phenomena using monte carlo simulations in the short - time regime have been published and their results are in good agreement with theoretical predictions and numerical results found in equilibrium @xcite .",
    "in addition , the new approach has proven to be useful in determining with good precision the dynamic exponent @xmath4 , as well as the new exponent @xmath3 which governs the so - called critical initial slip @xcite , the anomalous behavior of the magnetization when the system is quenched to the critical temperature @xmath7 .    the dynamic scaling relation obtained by janssen _",
    "@xcite for the _",
    "_ k__th moment of the magnetization , extended to systems of finite size , is written as @xmath8 where @xmath2 is the time evolution , @xmath9 is an arbitrary spatial scaling factor , @xmath10 is the reduced temperature and @xmath11 is the linear size of the lattice .",
    "the exponents @xmath6 and @xmath5 are as usual the equilibrium critical exponents associated respectively with the order parameter and the correlation length and @xmath12 is related to the exponents @xmath4 , @xmath3 , @xmath6 and @xmath5 by the equation @xmath13    by setting the scaling factor @xmath14 and @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling ] ) , we obtain the first moment of the magnetization @xmath16 where @xmath17 represents the initial magnetization of the system .",

    "@xcite studying the behavior of the global persistence probability @xmath1 that the order parameter has not changed its sign up to the time @xmath2 . at criticality @xmath1",
    "is expected to decay algebraically as @xmath18 where @xmath0 is the global persistence exponent .",
    "if the time evolution would be a markovian process , then the exponent @xmath0 should obey the equation @xcite @xmath19 however , as shown in several works @xcite the exponent @xmath0 is an independent critical index closely related to the non - markovian character of the process .    in this paper , we estimate the global persistence exponent of the 4-state potts model employing an alternative order parameter first used by vanderzande @xcite in the study of the z(5 ) model .",
    "our estimate is in complete agreement with the results obtained recently for the ising model with three - spin interactions in one direction and for the 4-state potts model @xcite with its traditional order parameter ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : old ] ) ) .",
    "in addition , comparing with estimates for the ising and 3-state potts models @xcite , there are consistently increasing values from @xmath20 to @xmath21 . in order to check the validity of that alternative order parameter , we also estimate the dynamic critical exponents @xmath3 and @xmath4 , along with the static critical exponents @xmath5 and @xmath6 . our results [ @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are in complete agreement with previous results found in the literature . in section [ section2 ]",

    "the _ q_-state potts model @xcite is a generalization of the ising model that preserves the next - nearest neighbour interaction , works with only two energies ( neighboring spins are in the same state or not ) but permits to put at each site any number of states ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "this model encloses a quite number of other problems of statistical physics .",
    "it undergoes a first - order phase transition when @xmath27 and a continuous phase transiton for @xmath28 . thus along with the ising model",
    ", the potts model is an important laboratory to check new theories and algorithms in the study of critical phenomena . although its exact solution is not known , several results were obtained during the last fifty years @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the _ q_-state potts model is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath32 represents nearest - neighbor pairs of lattice sites , @xmath33 is the dimensionless ferromagnetic coupling constant and @xmath34 is the spin variable which takes the values @xmath35 on the lattice site @xmath36 .",
    "it is well known that the critical point of this model is given by @xcite @xmath37 usually , the order parameter of this model is given by @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath11 is the linear size of the lattice and @xmath39 is the dimension of the system .    in this paper , we use a different definition for the order parameter , first proposed by vanderzande @xcite studying the z(5 ) model .",
    "it can be written as @xmath40 where the average @xmath41 is taken over independent initial configurations .",
    "we performed short - time monte carlo simulations to obtain the critical exponents for the 4-state potts model .",
    "simulations were carried out for square lattices with periodic boundary conditions and dimensions @xmath42 , 180 and 240 .",
    "we also used the lattice sizes @xmath43 , 30 , 40 , 50 , 60 and 90 just to estimate the exponent @xmath4 through the scaling collapses for different lattice sizes .",
    "the estimates for each exponent were obtained from five independent bins in the critical temperature . for the exponents @xmath0 , @xmath4 , @xmath6 and @xmath5 , each bin consisted of 20000 samples , whereas for the exponent @xmath3 we have used 100000 samples . when estimating the exponent @xmath4 through the scaling collapses , we used 50000 samples .",
    "the error bars are fluctuations of the averages obtained from those bins .",
    "the dynamic evolution of the spins is local and updated by the heat - bath algorithm .    in the following sections we show the results for the dynamic and static exponents of the 4-state potts model .",
    "first of all we are concerned with the global persistence probability @xmath1 .",
    "it is defined as the probability that the global order parameter has not change its sign up to time @xmath2 . for @xmath15 ,",
    "the global persistence probability decays algebraically as @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath0 is the global persistence exponent .",
    "in order to estimate the critical exponent @xmath0 , a sharp preparation of the initial states is demanded in order to obtain a precise value for the initial magnetization @xmath45 . after obtaining the critical exponent @xmath0 for several values of the initial magnetization @xmath17 ,",

    ", it is worth to explain how obtain a small value of @xmath17 in eq .",

    "first , each site on the lattice is occupied by a spin variable which takes the values @xmath47 , 1 , 2 or 3 with equal probability .",
    "after , the magnetization is measured by using @xmath48 and then , the variables in the sites are randomly chosen up to obtain a null value for the magnetization .",
    "the last procedure is to change @xmath49 sites on the lattice in order to obtain the desired initial magnetization .",

    "we emphasize that sometimes the value of the initial magnetizations for the lattice size @xmath57 are slighty different from those of the @xmath52 .",

[ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     our results show that the anomalous dimension of the 4-state potts model has a null value whose meaning is the presence of the marginal operator , i.e. , the operator which has the scaling dimension equal to dimensionality of the system and whose effect is not modified under renormalization - group operations .",

    "@xcite for this model and for the ising model with three - spin interactions in one direction .",
