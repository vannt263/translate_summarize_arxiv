    "the frequency conversion of light fields has been an important theme in optical physics for around half a century . in quantum information physics the conversion of single photons to and from the telecom wavelength band is a topic of more recent vintage , and is motivated by the desire to minimize optical fiber transmission losses when distributing entangled states over distant quantum memory elements in a quantum repeater @xcite .",
    "an associated technical problem is that telecom light is not readily stored in ground level atomic memory coherences .",
    "retrieval processes in atomic ensembles , for example using electromagnetically induced transparency @xcite , or more specifically the dark - polariton mechanism @xcite , generate shorter wavelength radiation correlated to the stored atomic excitation by raman scattering .",
    "such radiation , optically resonant to the ground level of typical atoms and ions , has been retrieved in numerous experiments @xcite .",
    "an important advance would involve generation of atomic memory coherences quantum - correlated with telecom wavelength radiation , thereby minimizing transmission losses over long distances .",
    "recently there has been a breakthrough in this direction using a pair of cold , nondegenerate rubidium gas samples @xcite .",
    "the stored excitation is correlated with an infrared field ( idler ) in one gas sample , and the idler is then frequency converted to a telecom wavelength signal field in the other ensemble .",
    "the frequency conversion mechanism involves the diamond configuration of atomic levels shown in fig . 1 .    in a probabilistic protocol",
    "it is important to maximize all efficiencies , e.g. , fiber transmission , single - photon detection and quantum memory lifetime @xcite . in the present work",
    "we investigate the efficiency of frequency up- and down- conversion in the diamond atomic configuration @xcite , as a function of the ensemble s optical thickness , and the intensity and detuning of the pump fields involved in the near - resonant , four - wave mixing process .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we discuss the four wave mixing process and present solutions for the up- and down- converted fields ; the dressed state picture is used as a guide to understand the characteristic features of the absorption and signal - idler field coupling , as a function of the microscopic interaction parameters . in sec .",
    "iii we present results of an optimization of the conversion efficiency as a function of the optical depth of the atomic ensemble . in sec .",
    "iv we investigate the effects of finite pulse duration by integrating the maxwell - bloch equations for the system .",
    "section v presents our conclusions .",
    "the derivations of the maxwell - bloch and parametric equations are relegated to the appendix .     and propagated probe fields ( single line ) @xmath0 interact with the atomic medium .",
    "various detunings are defined in the appendix and the atomic levels used in the experiment @xcite are @xmath1,width=340,height=245 ]",
    "in this paper , we consider a cold and cigar - shaped @xmath2rb atomic ensemble with co - propagating light fields similar to the experimental setup in ref .",

    "[ four ] involves two pump lasers with frequencies @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively ; their rabi frequencies are given by @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "two weak probe fields , signal and idler , with frequency @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively , propagate through the optically thick atomic medium . unlike the cascade driving scheme , where two - photon excitation generates a photon pair spontaneously @xcite , pump laser b experiences a transparent medium if both the signal and idler fields are in the vacuum state . with an incident signal field , four wave mixing with the pumps generates an up - converted idler field , while an incident idler field generates a down - converted signal .",
    "the maxwell - bloch equations for the interacting system of light and four light fields is derived in the appendix . by linearizing the equations with respect to the signal and idler field amplitudes , and adiabatically eliminating the atoms ,",
    "one arrives at coupled parametric equations for the signal and idler fields .",
    "we discuss their solution in this section , and leave numerical solutions of the maxwell bloch equations to sec .",
    "the calculation of conversion efficiencies can also be carried out with the quantized heisenberg - langevin version of the coupled parametric equations .",
    "the resulting conversion efficiencies are identical to the semi - classical treatment ; the additional quantum noise contributions vanish as the @xmath9 transition driven by pump laser b has vanishing populations and atomic coherence .",
    "a similar simplification occurs in the calculation of the storage efficiency of spin waves in a system of atoms in the @xmath10 configuration @xcite .    the co - moving propagation equation for c - number signal and idler fields ( respectively , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) under energy conservation ( @xmath13 ) and four - wave mixing conditions ( @xmath14 ) are@xmath15 the coupled equations are similar to those found for the double @xmath10 system @xcite .",

    "there is a conservation condition @xmath42  the parametric coupling coefficients are not identical , but in the regime of strong coupling they approach each other . as noted by gogyan ,",
    "when the pump - a intensity is large ( @xmath43 ) the @xmath44 is saturated , the atomic coherence is negligible and @xmath45 .",
    "alternatively , in the limit @xmath46 and @xmath47 the atomic coherence of @xmath44 dominates and once again @xmath48 .",
    "the ac - stark splitting induced by the pump lasers shifts the resonant absorption condition for the idler and signal fields . the idler and signal experience resonant absorption at the transition frequency of the dressed atom .",
    "the corresponding transitions for the idler are shown in fig.[dress ] .",
    "the bare states are shifted by @xmath49 and @xmath50 respectively .",

    "the idler transition resonances are at @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 and these delineate three windows separated by these four absorption peaks . for @xmath56",
    "the centers of these windows are at @xmath57 @xmath58 and @xmath5 , respectively . choosing the idler detuning @xmath59 as in @xcite , the idler interacts with the atomic medium at the center of the left or right window .    as an example of the strong coupling windows created by intense pump lasers , we show in fig .",
    "[ coefficient ] the self- and cross - coupling coefficients for the signal and idler fields as a function of the idler frequency .",

    "we choose the optical depth ( opd ) @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the number density , @xmath66 the resonant absorption cross section , and @xmath67 the atomic ensemble length in the propagation direction .",
    "three parametric coupling windows are separated by two strong absorption peaks on the left and two relatively weak ones on the right .",
    "the imaginary part of the self - coupling coefficients are seen to vanish in each window at a certain point , while the real parts are small away from resonances . at the same time",
    "the cross - coupling coefficients have a large imaginary part .",
    "the positive gradient of im@xmath68 and im@xmath69 , inside the windows is indicative of normal dispersion .",
    "it is important to ascertain the parameters which allow maximum efficiency of conversion due its potential in practical quantum information processing .  in principle",
    "we need to search the three parametric coupling windows to find the optimum conditions for an atomic ensemble of a given optical thickness .    in the previous section",
    "we have discussed how three parametric coupling windows appear for some particular values of pump laser parameters .  in the search for the maximal conversion efficiency , five parameters @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72",
    "are varied to maximize the conversion efficiency for a fixed optical depth of atomic ensemble , using functional optimization .",
    "the optical depth @xmath73 appears through the dependence on atomic number @xmath74 in the arecchi - courtens cooperation time @xmath75",
    "@xcite @xmath76  in fig .",
    "[ opd ] , we show the maximum of down conversion efficiency using eq.([down ] ) for different optical depths from @xmath77 to @xmath78 .  the maximum is found by varying five parameters mentioned above and the conversion efficiency reaches @xmath79 asymptotically when the optical depth becomes larger .  in the strong parametric coupling regime as we discussed in the previous section , @xmath80 $ ] and",
    "it has a maximum when @xmath81 see fig.[coefficient ] .",
    "since @xmath82 is proportional to optical depth and inversely proportional to the rabi frequencies of the driving lasers , an order of magnitude estimate of the optical depth necessary for near unit conversion efficiency is opd@xmath83 .",
    "the behavior of the cross - coupling coefficient @xmath84 as a function of idler detuning indicates where large conversion is to be found , as a comparison with fig.[trans ] shows",
    ".  the maximum efficiency of about @xmath85 is located in the left parametric coupling window at the intersection of @xmath84 and @xmath86 .  inside the windows",
    "the trade - off between conversion and transmission is clear .  in the region where absorption is large , on the sides of the window ( especially for the left window ) , the efficiency and the transmission are both low although the valley in conversion efficiency corresponds to a peak in transmission as expected in parametric coupling .",
    "the transmission approaches unity when the incident idler field is far off - resonance .",
    "we note that the symmetry @xmath87 gives degenerate optimal conversion conditions .",
    "the effect of finite - duration input probe pulses , which are often employed in practice , can be assessed by numerically solving the maxwell - bloch equations for the coupled atoms - fields system .",
    "the characteristic scales of time and length are given by the arecchi - courtens time @xmath75 and @xmath88 , respectively , which are inversely proportional to the square root of the opd .",
    "the cooperative electric field is the product of the atomic number and the idler electric field per photon , i.e. , @xmath89    scaling the space , time , and electric field amplitude accordingly , indicated by tildes , the light propagation equation becomes @xmath90 a consistent scaling can also be applied to the atomic dynamical equations presented in the appendix .",
    "the maxwell - bloch equations were integrated with a semi - implicit finite difference method @xcite .",
    "the mid - point integration method is stable and has high accuracy without sacrificing memory for finer grids @xcite .",
    "the algorithm has been tested by comparing with the parametric equations solutions in appropriate limits , and these solutions are recovered when fine enough grids are employed .    to illustrate the influence of finite pump pulse duration , we compute the down conversion efficiency @xmath91    in fig . [ pulse ] , we show the computed values of @xmath24 for two different input idler pulse durations .",
    "we fix the opd@xmath92 and use the near optimum parameters ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 ) @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 determined from the coupled parametric equations .",
    "the temporal shape of the pump laser intensities are also shown .",
    "pump laser b is taken to be continuous wave , while pump a is a square pulse with duration large enough to completely overlap the input idler pulse .  to compare with the steady state solutions , we choose the rabi frequency of idler as @xmath98 which is small compare to those of the pumps .",
    "we find that the conversion efficiency is reduced for shorter idler pulse inputs .",
    "a @xmath99 ns idler pulse is long enough that it has _ * a * _ almost the same maximum conversion efficiency of  @xmath85 as in fig.[opd ] for opd=150 .  while for the shorter idler pulse of @xmath100 ns , the signal develops significant temporal modulation and this reduces the conversion efficiency , although it is still quite appreciable .",
    "the modulation frequency is at the generalized rabi frequency of pump - a @xmath101 .",
    "we note the characteristic time and space scales of the calculations are @xmath102 ns and @xmath103 mm for a moderate atomic density @xmath104@xmath105 and @xmath106 mm .",
    "the grid size for dimensionless time @xmath107 and space @xmath108 were chosen for both @xmath99 and @xmath100 ns idler pulse durations and the convergence is reached with an estimated relative error less than @xmath109 .",
    "we have studied light frequency conversion in an atomic ensemble with a diamond configuration of atomic levels such as @xmath2rb .",
    "the motivation stems from the need to efficiently convert light resonant with ground state transitions ( storable in the sense of quantum memories ) to and from the telecom wavelength band for low - loss quantum network communication .",
    "the optically thick atomic sample is driven by two strong co - propagating pump fields , and a probe idler or signal field depending on whether we consider down- or up - conversion .",
    "parametric equations for the probe fields are derived and used to compute conversion efficiencies . by performing a global search",
    "we find conditions of pump rabi frequencies , detunings and signal / idler input frequency to maximize the conversion efficiency as a function of optical depth of the ensemble . only in the limit of very large optical depth",
    "does the maximum efficiency approach the ideal strong coupling result @xcite . under conditions routinely obtained in cold , non - degenerate rubidium gas , with opd @xmath110 ,",
    "optimal conversion efficiencies of the order @xmath111 to @xmath112 are predicted . numerical solution of the maxwell - bloch equations confirms the solution of the parametric equations in the limit of long pulse duration , and indicates that for shorter pulses , pump pulse induced modulation may reduce the conversion efficiency .",
