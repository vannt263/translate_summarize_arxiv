    "in  @xcite aerts constructed an remarkable macroscopic model in which he could operationally define coincidence experiments violating ( the chsh version of ) bell s inequality ( bi ) , with exactly the same numerical value @xmath0 as the one obtained in typical coincidence experiments with entangled microscopic entities in a singlet state  @xcite ( which corresponds to the maximal violation obtainable in quantum mechanics  @xcite ) .",
    "subsequently , the model was generalized in  @xcite , with the introduction of two parameters , @xmath1 $ ] , quantifying the degree of indeterminism and of non - locality present in the model , respectively .",
    "more precisely , @xmath2 corresponds to the classical situation of absence of indeterminism , whereas @xmath3 to the situation of maximum indeterminism , typical of pure quantum systems . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath4 corresponds to the situation of maximum locality , when the two pairs forming the double - system are totally disconnected , whereas @xmath5 corresponds to the opposite situation of perfect correlation .",
    "the authors of  @xcite obtain that bi can only be violated if @xmath6 , and that the violation takes its maximal numerical value @xmath7 when @xmath5 ( maximum correlation ) and @xmath2 ( minimum indeterminism ) . also , they find that for any @xmath8 , it is always possible to restore the validity of bi by increasing @xmath9 , whereas this is not any more possible if @xmath10 .    to sum up , the study of the model described in  @xcite has showed that the source of the violation of bi is the existence of a non zero correlation between the two pairs forming the double - system ( @xmath6 ) , whereas the only effect of increasing the level of indeterminism ( increasing @xmath9 ) is to decrease the value the inequality can take .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to analyze a different macroscopic model in which two parameters @xmath9 and @xmath11 will also be introduced , as in  @xcite , to continuously vary the level of indeterminism and non - locality ( correlation ) .",
    "this will allow us to confirm that a non zero correlation ( @xmath6 ) is the necessary condition for the violation of the inequality .",
    "however , we will also show that by increasing the indeterminism ( increasing @xmath9 ) we can either increase or decrease the value bi can take , depending on the state in which the system is prepared before the coincidence experiments .",
    "before describing our macroscopic model , we briefly recall the expression of bell s inequality ( bi ) .  @xcite . on a given physical entity",
    ", we assume that four different experiments can be performed : @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "we call @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 the outcomes associated to these four experiments , which can only take the values @xmath20 or @xmath21 .",
    "we also assume that experiments @xmath12 and @xmath13 can be performed together with either of experiments @xmath14 and @xmath15 , so defining additional _ coincidence _ experiments : @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 . to every coincidence experiment @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , we can then associate the expectation value @xmath29 of the product of outcomes @xmath30 , by : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the probability that the coincidence experiment @xmath26 yields the outcomes @xmath33 .    under certain hypothesis ( usually referred to as _ bell locality _ , which have to do with the existence of hidden variables independently determining the experiments outcomes ) , one can prove the following ( bell ) inequality  @xcite : @xmath34    inequality ( [ bell inequalities ] ) is generally violated by quantum systems in entangled states , like for instance those formed by two spin-@xmath35 entities in a _ singlet ( zero ) spin state _ , for which one can show that @xmath36 .",
    "@xcite this means that entangled quantum systems generally violate bell s locality assumption , a fact which remains true even when the two subsystems are separated by a very large spatial distance . in other terms , no local physical theory in the sense specified by bell can agree with all statistical implications of quantum mechanics , and spatial separation is not a sufficient condition for _ experimental separation_.",
    "let us consider a solid object , of homogeneous density , shaped as a rectangular @xmath37-prism ( @xmath37 even ) , i.e. , as a polyhedron formed by @xmath37 identical parallelogram - faces , and two lateral regular polygon - faces with @xmath37 sides ( see fig .",
    "[ esagono singolo ] for the case @xmath38 , of an hexagonal prism ) .",
    "we consider the prism as a special kind of die with @xmath37 faces , which can be rolled on a flat surface ( perpendicular to the gravitational field ) , along a given `` roll - direction , '' parallel to the two short sides of the rectangular upper face ( see fig .  [ esagono singolo ] ) .",
    "each rectangular face of the prism shows either a symbol `` @xmath39 , '' or a symbol `` @xmath40 . ''",
    "the `` + '' symbol is only printed on @xmath41 parallel ( opposed ) rectangular faces of the prism , whereas the symbol `` - '' is printed on all the remaining @xmath42 rectangular faces .",
    "we also assume that the `` + '' and `` - '' faces are made of different materials .",
    "the two `` + '' faces can slide with an extremely low friction on the flat surface , whereas the @xmath42 `` - '' faces present a very high coefficient of friction with respect to it .",
    "considering that the upper and lower faces of the prism always present the same symbol ( and therefore are made of the same material ) , we have that when the prism presents a `` + '' upper face , it can slide with almost no friction , whereas it can not do so if the upper face has a `` - '' symbol .    in the following , when the prism presents a `` + '' ( respectively , `` - '' ) upper face , we shall simply say that it is in state ( + ) [ ( respectively , state ( - ) ] .",
    "let us now describe what we shall call a _ rolling experiment _ with the prism .",
    "it consists in placing a specific shooter ( similar to a `` flipper ball shooter '' ) behind the prism , along the roll - direction , pulling firmly its knob and then releasing it , thus communicating to the prism an a priori unpredictable impulsion ( see fig .",
    "[ shooter esagono ] ) .",
    "one then waits until the prism stops completely , and read the symbol on its upper face .",
    "if it is a `` +  , '' the outcome of the experiment is the value @xmath20 , otherwise the value @xmath21 .",
    "if the prism is in state @xmath43 , then , because of the very low friction of the face in contact with the surface , it will not roll , but only glide on it , until all translational kinetic energy will be converted into heat .",
    "therefore , the rolling experiment will not change the prism s upper face , and the outcome will be @xmath20 , with certainty",
    ".    on the other hand , if the prism is in state @xmath44 , then the face in contact with the surface will present an extremely high coefficient of friction with it , so that the prism will not anymore slide but roll ( i.e. , rotate around its longitudinal axis ) .",
    "typically , most of the energy communicated to it by the shooter will be initially transformed into rotational kinetic energy , then , because of the positive work performed by the friction forces , the rotational energy will be gradually transformed into translational kinetic energy and heat , and of course in the end the prism will stop and show a specific upper face .",
    "however , the prism will roll only for as long as the non - elastic effects associated with the _ rolling frictions _",
    "remain lower than the _ sliding frictions _",
    ", since in this case the prism requires less energy to be moved by rolling than by sliding .",
    "but since two of the @xmath37 faces involved in the rolling movement ( those with the `` + '' symbol ) present a very low sliding friction , it is highly probable that the prism will conclude its run sliding on one of them , before it will ultimately totally stops .    in other terms ,",
    "apart from exceptional circumstances , which we can simply ignore not to complicate unnecessarily our discussion , we can _ ideally _ assume that , following a rolling experiment , if the initial state is @xmath44 then the final state will be @xmath43 , with certainty .",
    "so , our prism is so conceived that , independently of its initial state [ @xmath43 or @xmath44 ] , the outcome of a rolling experiment will always be @xmath20 [ i.e. , its final state will always be @xmath43 ] .",
    "we now consider two identical @xmath37-prisms , and use them to construct an entangled system by connecting them through space , by means of a rigid rod ( the length of the rod is arbitrary , but we assume it is made of an extremely light and rigid material ) whose two ends are glued at the center of the two opposed polygon - faces of the two prisms , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ esagoni - connected ]",
    ".    clearly , the connecting rod creates correlations between the @xmath37 different rectangular faces of the two prisms .",
    "here we assume that the two prisms have been connected in such a way that the correlations in question are those described in fig .",
    "[ n - prism - correspondence ] .",
    "we assume that the glue used to connect the rod to the two prisms is strong enough , so that if the two prisms are hit together , simultaneously ( in the same direction ) they will be able to maintain their connection while rolling , i.e. , to remain a whole entity .",
    "but we also assume that the glue , although strong , is not as strong as to allow the two prisms to remain connected if only one prism is hit at a time .    in other terms ,",
    "if we hit with the shooter only one of the two prism , then , because of the inertia of the other prism , the impact will cause the rod to suddenly detach and fall , thus disconnecting the two solids ( one of which will then move in the roll - direction , whereas the other one will remain still ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if two experimenters hit with two shooters both prisms at the same time , then the torque experienced by the rod will be much lower , so that the latter will not detach and the two prisms will be able to roll together on the surface , as a one piece entity .",
    "on the double - prism system we have just defined , we perform four different coincidence experiments and show that they produce a violation of bi . for this",
    ", we assume that two experimenters ( who we shall call experimenter @xmath47 and experimenter @xmath48 ) are placed close to each one of the two prisms .",
    "experimenter @xmath47 can perform on his prism ( say , the left one ) two different experiments , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , which are defined as follow .    experiment @xmath12 is the rolling experiment we have defined in sec .  [ a rolling prism ] : it consists in hitting the left prism with a shooter along the roll - direction , then reading the symbol marked on the obtained upper face , producing in this way one of the two outcomes : @xmath49 , or @xmath50 .",
    "experiment @xmath13 is much simpler : it simply consists in looking at the prism s upper face and check whether it is flat or not .",
    "if it is so , then the outcome is @xmath51 , otherwise it is @xmath52 .",
    "experimenters @xmath48 can perform on its prism ( the right one ) the same two experiments as experimenters @xmath47 . in other terms , @xmath14 is defined as @xmath12 , and @xmath15 as @xmath13 .    clearly ,",
    "all of the four above mentioned experiments , when singly performed , can only produce the outcome @xmath20 . also , when the coincidence experiments @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are performed by the two experimenters , the only possible outcome for them is @xmath53 , so that according to ( [ expectation value ] ) , @xmath54 .",
    "the situation is however more articulate for experiment @xmath22 , which creates correlations between upper faces .",
    "indeed , if the two experimenters hit simultaneously the two prisms , then , as we explained , the rod will not separate and they will remain connected as they roll ( the double - prism system can not slide , but only roll , as one of its two lower faces is always a high - friction face ) .",
    "therefore , according to fig .",
    "[ n - prism - correspondence ] , we have that the probability for the outcome @xmath55 is zero , the probability for each one of the two outcomes @xmath56 and @xmath57 is @xmath58 , and the probability for the outcome @xmath55 is @xmath59 .",
    "thus , @xmath60 = 1-(8/n)$ ] . inserting all this in ( [ bell inequalities ] ) ,",
    "we obtain : @xmath61    eq .",
    "( [ violation - n ] ) clearly violates bi ( [ bell inequalities ] ) .",
    "it does so in a maximal way ( @xmath62 ) for the case @xmath63 of two tetragonal prisms , and with a value which is very close to the quantum mechanical maximum of @xmath64 for the case @xmath65 of two decagonal prisms ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "before continuing in our analysis , let us mention that it was diederik aerts who was the first , in the early eighties of last century , to conceive an explicit macroscopic model with non - local correlations violating bi in a maximal way ,  @xcite , as our double - prism system with @xmath63 can do ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite and the references cited therein ) .",
    "an important difference between our double - prism model and the historical ( connected vessels of water ) model of aerts , is that in the latter it is the fact that the system is broken which is the mechanism responsible for the creation of correlations , whereas in our model it is exactly the contrary : it is only when the double system is _ not _ broken that the coincidence experiment @xmath22 can produce correlations between upper faces ( it is important to distinguish `` faces '' from `` upper faces , '' as only the latter are created in a rolling experiment : if we do nt create upper faces , by rolling the prisms , bi can not be violated  @xcite ) .",
    "we want now to vary the amount of indeterminism and non - locality in our model , to see how this can affect the degree of violation of bi , thus elucidating their role in the violation .",
    "first of all , let us observe that if the number @xmath37 of rectangular faces of the two prisms tends to infinity , the probability @xmath67 tends to @xmath68 , so that in this limit , according to ( [ violation - n ] ) , @xmath69 .    one could be tempted then to affirm that the level of indeterminism decreases as @xmath70 , and that this produces a corresponding decrease of the degree of violation of bi , contrary to what was obtained by aerts and collaborators , who showed instead that a decrease of indeterminism produces a stronger violation of bi .",
    "@xcite    this however would be a wrong conclusion .",
    "indeed , if by increasing @xmath37 we can reduce the value taken by bi , this is so because for each different @xmath37 we have a different physical system , and not because we are decreasing the level of indeterminism in a given physical system .",
    "what we have to do , instead , is to vary such level within a same double - prism system , characterized by a fixed value of @xmath37 .",
    "there are of course different ways to do so . a simple one is to consider that the two experimenters , who have to hit the prisms in the rolling experiments , may not just do it aimlessly , but trying to obtain the specific effect of having the two prisms rolling over a predetermined distance , thus producing a predetermined total angle of rotation .",
    "of course , this will make a difference only when the two experimenters are executing the coincidence experiment @xmath22 , as is clear from the fact that when they do nt hit the two prisms together ( in experiments @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) , then because of the extreme low friction of the `` + '' faces ( and the fact that , according to the protocol , they have to pull the knob firmly , i.e. , hit the prism strongly ) they will not succeed in altering the predetermined @xmath71 outcome .",
    "now , let us assume that if the two players are successful in producing the chosen rotation in the coincidence experiment @xmath23 , then , considering the state in which the system was prepared , the outcome of the rolling experiment will be @xmath72 ( or @xmath73 ) . in general terms , we can characterize the ability of the two players in obtaining the desired effect by means of a continuous parameter @xmath74 $ ] , such that @xmath75 corresponds to the totally random situation , of maximum indeterminism , when the experimenters hit the two prisms without trying to obtain any specific result , and @xmath2 corresponds to the opposite situation where the two players are able to perfectly control their shot and therefore produce the @xmath72 ( or @xmath73 ) outcome , without fail . in other terms , by varying @xmath9 from @xmath68 to @xmath76 , we can decrease the degree of indeterminism in the measurement processes .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we also want to introduce , in addition to the indeterminism parameter @xmath9 , an additional continuous parameter @xmath77 $ ] , characterizing the connectedness of the two prisms ( i.e. , the strength of the correlations between the rectangular faces of the two prisms )",
    ". a simple and natural way to do so is to consider the possibility that , sometimes , the rod can also detach and fall during the execution of the @xmath22 experiment .",
    "let us simply assume that @xmath11 corresponds to the probability for the rod of remaining duly glued to the two prisms , when @xmath22 is executed .",
    "this means that @xmath5 corresponds to the case of maximum correlation , whereas @xmath4 to the case of absence of correlation . in other terms , by varying @xmath11 from @xmath68 to @xmath76 , we can decrease the degree of connectedness ( non - locality ) of the two entangled prism - entities .",
    "clearly , when the rod detaches , the two prism will necessarily end their respective roll by showing an upper face with the `` + '' symbol , and this means that the outcome @xmath53 is now also possible for the experiment @xmath22 , with probability @xmath78 .",
    "assuming for simplicity a linear variation of the probabilities as a function of the ability parameter @xmath9 , we can write for the four different outcomes of experiment @xmath22 : @xmath79    then , observing that the probabilities associated with the other three coincidence experiments are not directly affected by the values taken by @xmath9 and @xmath11 ( this because , when the two prisms are rolled independently from one another , they will inevitably end their run by showing a `` + '' upper face ) , we obtain , after a short calculation : @xmath80.\\ ] ]    visibly , ( [ i - epsilon - rho ] ) generalizes ( [ violation - n ] ) , and in accordance with the analysis of the model in  @xcite , we can observe the following . only for the value @xmath4 , corresponding to two totally disconnected prisms , bi is obeyed , and this means that it is the correlation between the two subsystems , i.e. , the non - locality ingredient , which is really responsible for the violation .    also , we can see that when we increase @xmath9 , i.e. , the amount of uncertainty in the outcome of the experiments , we clearly also diminish the value of ( [ i - epsilon - rho ] ) , i.e. , the degree of violation of bi , which means that , in accordance with  @xcite , not only indeterminism ( associated here to parameter @xmath9 ) does nt contribute to the violation , but actually tends to reduce it .",
    "clearly , the maximum violation , @xmath62 , is obtained for @xmath81 and @xmath2 , i.e. , for the situation of perfect correlation and full predictability .",
    "it is however important to observe that although inequality ( [ violation - n ] ) is independent of the choice of the initial state of the double - prism system ( which can either be @xmath82 , @xmath83 or @xmath84 ) , this is not anymore the case when the outcomes of the experiments are affected by the ability parameter @xmath9 . indeed , for a given rolling distance ( i.e. , for a given total angle of rotation ) that the two experimenters will try to obtain , if we change the initial state of the system , then we will also change the expected outcome of the experiment , and therefore the value taken by bi .    to see this ,",
    "let us assume this time that the system is prepared in a state such that when the two experimenters can successfully impart to the double - prism the chosen total rotation angle , the final outcome is now @xmath55 , instead of the previous @xmath72 ( or @xmath73 ) .",
    "then , we obtain the following probabilities for the four outcomes of experiment @xmath22 : @xmath85.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    observing once more that the probabilities associated to the other three coincidence experiments are not affected by the specific values taken by @xmath9 and @xmath11 , we find after a short calculation : @xmath86    as we can see , ( [ i - epsilon - rho - bis ] ) differs sensibly from ( [ i - epsilon - rho ] ) , and the effect produced by a variation of parameter @xmath9 is now exactly opposite : an increase of the level of indeterminism ( i.e. , an increase of @xmath9 ) produces a strengthening of the violation of bi , and not a weakening of it .",
    "also , the situation of full predictability ( @xmath2 ) is not anymore associated to a maximal violation of the inequality , but to the non - violation of it !",
    "we conclude with a few comments .",
    "first of all , it could be objected that , contrary to the model explored in  @xcite , @xmath9 is not the only source of indeterminism in our model , considering that we have defined the parameter @xmath11 as a probability , and that the outcomes of the coincidence experiments @xmath22 clearly depend on whether the rod will detach or not during their execution . in other terms",
    ", @xmath11 also contributes to the degree of unpredictability of the outcomes of @xmath22 .",
    "this is obviously true , but can not alter our conclusion . indeed ,",
    "if we keep @xmath11 fixed , then an increase of @xmath9 does actually correspond to a global increase of the level of indeterminism in our model , which , according to ( [ i - epsilon - rho ] ) and ( [ i - epsilon - rho - bis ] ) , can either reinforce or weaken the degree of the violation of bi , depending on the state in which the system was prepared .",
    "in fact , our probabilistic description of non - locality in the model highlights an additional mechanism through which a variation of the amount of indeterminism can affect the value taken by bi , in a way that is not unique . indeed ,",
    "as regards the randomness incorporated in @xmath11 , we can consider that the situation @xmath87 corresponds to the one of maximum uncertainty .",
    "then , when from that value of maximum uncertainty we increase @xmath11 , and therefore reduce the uncertainty , according to ( [ i - epsilon - rho ] ) and ( [ i - epsilon - rho - bis ] ) we increase the violation of bi , and this independently of the initial state of the system .",
    "but when starting from the same value @xmath87 we decrease @xmath11 , also in this case we reduce the uncertainty , yet this time we decrease the violation of bi ( which for the limit value @xmath4 is obeyed ) , independently of the initial state of the system .",
    "having said that , let us now explain why , when the level of indeterminism is increased in our model , by increasing @xmath9 , we can either increase or decrease the violation of bi , depending on the initial state of the system . for simplicity ,",
    "let us set @xmath5 ( perfect correlation ) .",
    "considering that in our model @xmath88 , independently of the value taken by @xmath9 , we can write : @xmath89 .",
    "now , having assumed perfect correlation , it is clear that only three outcomes are possible for experiment @xmath22 : @xmath84 , @xmath83 and @xmath82 . according to ( [ expectation value ] )",
    ", outcome @xmath84 contributes positively to @xmath90 , whereas outcomes @xmath83 and @xmath82 contribute negatively to it .",
    "therefore , if the outcome of experiment @xmath22 is predetermined , and corresponds to @xmath84 , @xmath91 and bi is obeyed ( @xmath92 ) . on the other hand , if the predetermined outcome is @xmath83 , or @xmath82 , @xmath93 and bi is maximally violated ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "assuming that we are in the situation where @xmath91 , for @xmath94 , then by increasing @xmath9 the system will start sometimes to also explore the outcomes @xmath83 , or @xmath82 , and since the latter contribute negatively to @xmath95 , their possible selection will cause its value to diminish , thus producing an increase in the violation of bi . and of course , the situation is reversed when @xmath93 , for @xmath94",
    ".    the reason why aerts et al . could nt highlight in  @xcite this double role played by indeterminism in coincidence experiments , is because the statistics of outcomes of their model does not depend on the specific state in which the system is prepared , but only on the relative orientation of the measuring apparatus ( as is the case in spin measurements on singlet states , provided the direction of flight of the entangled pair is orthogonal to the directions of orientation of the stern - gerlach filters ) .",
    "therefore , although they have studied a model which is more elaborated than ours ( as meant to reproduce the same statistics as spin measurements on singlet states ) , it was actually too specific to fully elucidate the question of the role played by indeterminism in the violation of bi .    to conclude",
    ", we briefly summarize our results . in agreement with  @xcite",
    ", we have found that it is the aspect of non - locality , expressed by the connecting rod in our model , which produces the violation of bi , through the _ creation of correlations _ between outcomes of experiments performed in coincidence .    in agreement with  @xcite",
    ", we have also found that by increasing the indeterminism ( increasing @xmath9 ) , we can decrease the value taken by bi .",
    "however , we have also shown that this is not a general fact : depending on the state in which the system is prepared , an increase of the level of indeterminism is also capable of increasing the value taken by bi .",
    "an additional source of indeterminism can also be envisioned , that was not considered in  @xcite , associated to the possibility of actualizing different degrees of non - locality ( connectedness ) in a coincidence experiment .",
    "this possibility was described in our model by assuming that not only correlations between `` upper faces '' had to be considered as potential before a coincidence experiment , but also correlations between `` faces . ''    when we do so , we find that if the amount of indeterminism associated to this additional level of potentiality is decreased , it can either increase or decrease the value of bi , depending on whether the decrease produces a strengthening or a weakening of the non - local aspect , respectively . as far as this author",
    "can judge , it is still an open experimental question to know if a quantum microscopic system in an entangled state , like a singlet state , has also a probability of `` breaking '' during a coincidence experiment ( in the same way the rod in our macroscopic model has a probability of detaching ) , and produce in this way uncorrelated outcomes , instead of correlated ones .",
    "@xcite    a last remark is in order .",
    "the description of the rolling / sliding behavior of the @xmath37-prisms must be understood , as we already said , in an idealized sense .",
    "we have never performed real experiments with systems of this sort , and therefore can not guarantee that the way we have theoretically described their behavior , although reasonable , would be perfectly adequate from the perspective of a real experiment .",
    "but of course , this is not an essential point in the present analysis : what is important is that the idealized system we have considered behaves in a logical manner , according to coherent mechanisms .",
    "the question of how to exactly implement such behavior in real models , which can be subject to real experiments , is a technological issue which goes beyond the purely conceptual scope of the present note .",
