    "the conventional quantum description of open systems employs density matrices and their nonunitary evolution equations , i.  e. master equations .",
    "an equivalent description can be given in terms of wave functions , at the expense of introducing damping and noise terms in the schrdinger equation ( see e.  g.  ) . for a given open system , both the master equation and the corresponding stochastic schrdinger equation can be derived by treating the interaction , usually weak , with an environment .    whether one deals with a master equation or the equivalent stochastic schrdinger equation is mostly a matter of convenience .",
    "less work is involved in determining @xmath0 components of a state vector for a single realisation of the noise process rather than @xmath1 elements of a density matrix ; however , many realisations of the noise must be followed in order to establish the full information stored in the density matrix .",
    "apart from occasional computational convenience the stochastic schrdinger equation has a certain conceptional appeal .",
    "recent experiments on individual ions or atoms stored in electromagnetic traps have revived the old question about what quantum mechanics has to say about the course of a single run of an experiment .",
    "the so - called quantum jumps of an atom into or out of a metastable state and the accompanying random - telegraph modulation of a fluorescence signal , for instance , strengthen our interest in a formulation of dissipative quantum dynamics where random jumps are naturally reflected in the time dependence of the wave function .",
    "the stochastic schrdinger equation is particularly welcome to some researchers interested in quatum measurement theory .",
    "the seemingly scandalous effective collapse of a superposition to a mixture upon measurement is by now rather well understood , even on the basis of exactly solvable models @xcite .",
    "however , it is still esthetically satisfying to see the wavefunction of a pointer variable evolve , in each realization of the noise , to one particular distinguished displacement corresponding to one eigenvalue of the measured observable of some microsystem ; and to see many independent realisations of the noise build up the relative frequencies of the possible outcomes .",
    "other peculiarities of quantum mechanics , like schrdinger s cat and the epr paradox , appear under an interesting new perspective in the description by a stochastic schrdinger equation .",
    "the fate of schrdinger s cat was recently investigated numerically in a simple model in this manner @xcite .",
    "previous treatments of such problems using the density matrix @xcite were thus complemented in rather more intuitive ways .",
    "we here take up the cat problem again .",
    "we present a rigorous solution of a stochastic schrdinger equation for the damped harmonic oscillator , starting from an initial state of the cat type .",
    "it is most gratifying to see how the wavevector chooses randomly between the two possible and `` macroscopically '' distinguishable locations .",
    "the choice is made on the so - called _ decoherence _ time scale @xmath2 which is shorter than the mechanical damping time by a factor measuring the difference between the two initial locations . for each realization of the noise ,",
    "jumps between the two locations become exceedingly unlikely after several units of @xmath2 .",
    "noise can be accounted for in the stochastic schrdinger equation in different but essentially equivalent ways .",
    "one possibility is to let the noise represent vacuum and/or thermal fluctuations of the environment ; it is then natural to speak of input noise .",
    "alternatively , we may let the noisy part of the output of the system appear as stochastic driving .",
    "both forms of the noise are of course related to one another , as described by the input - output formalism of collet and gardiner @xcite . depending on which form of the noise",
    "is chosen in the stochastic schrdinger equation , the latter takes a linear or nonlinear appearance .",
    "the equivalence of the two formulations , recently shown by ghirardi , pearle and rimini @xcite , by belavkin and staszewski @xcite and by goetsch and graham @xcite , will be illustrated again below .",
    "we first discuss the solution of the linear stochastic schrdinger equation @xcite @xmath3 here @xmath4 is a real noise increment independent of its predecessors in time ; otherwise , @xmath4 need not be specified at this point . the index @xmath5 on the wave vector is meant to indicate the contingency of that vector on the noise history : @xmath6 is a functional of the noise increments arisen in the past but independent of the one arising at present , @xmath7 . to include the description of homodyning with a local oscillator of constant phase @xmath8 we have allowed for the phase factor @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "obviously , the generator appearing on the rhs of the stochastic schrdinger equation is non - hermitian for which reason the normalization of the vector @xmath6 is not preserved in time .",
    "due to its linearity in the state vector @xmath6 and the bilinearity of the generator in @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the stochastic schrdinger equation ( [ eq:2 - 1 ] ) can be solved rigorously .",
    "for instance , initial coherent states @xmath12 , defined as eigenstates of @xmath10 with eigenvalues @xmath13 , evolve into @xcite @xmath14 i.  e.  coherent states of amplitudes @xmath15 multiplied with stochastic factors of non - unit modulus , @xmath16 of special interest to us will be an initial superposition of two coherent states , @xmath17 for large values of the amplitudes , @xmath18 , for which the constituents @xmath19 become `` macroscopically distinguishable '' , such a superposition is customarily called a _ schrdinger cat state_. invoking the superposition principle we obtain the state originating from the superposition ( [ eq:2 - 4 ] ) as @xmath20 we can now address the mean of the quadrature component @xmath21 with respect to the normalized version of the time - evolved cat state ( [ eq:2 - 5 ] ) . to avoid unnecessary complication we shall henceforth take the amplitude @xmath22 as real and thus get @xmath23 clearly , this mean displacement vanishes initially , due to the symmetry of the initial state , and for large times , @xmath24 , due to the decay of @xmath25 .",
    "however , at intermediate times we encounter a nonvanishing functional of the noise @xmath26 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath27 on the phase of the local oscillator is interesting : for @xmath28 the overlap of the two normalized coherent states @xmath29 , @xmath30 enters only through the normalization factor @xmath31 ; for @xmath32 , on the other hand , the presence of that overlap is essential for the transient appearance of a finite mean @xmath33 , the exponential smallness of @xmath34 notwithstanding .",
    "having pointed out this delicate dependence on the phase @xmath8 we proceed to setting @xmath28 and writing @xmath35 instead of @xmath36 , for simplicity .",
    "we shall mostly be concerned with times small compared to the `` mechanical '' relaxation time @xmath37 . in that regime",
    "the mean displacement takes the simple form @xmath38 this results by approximating as @xmath39 and dropping the exponentially small overlap @xmath40 .",
    "we should note that the conditional mean @xmath41 , being a functional of the noise @xmath42 in @xmath43 , is a random quantity itself .",
    "it fluctuates from one realization of the process @xmath26 to another one , each of which one might feel tempted to associate with a particular run of an experiment .",
    "in order to compute full quantum averages of oscillator observables @xmath44 like the displacement @xmath35 we still have to average over the noise @xmath26 which we now need to specify .",
    "we want to describe an oscillator weakly interacting with a zero - temperature reservoir . by invoking the usual born and markov approximation ,",
    "the stochastic schrdinger equation was derived in @xcite , together with the prescription for calculating quantum means @xmath45 we here encounter the wiener measure @xmath46 for finding a realization @xmath42 of the noise during the time interval @xmath43 .",
    "the result ( [ eq:2 - 10 ] ) allows us to think of @xmath26 as the vacuum fluctuations of the reservoir forced on the oscillator as an `` input '' .",
    "an alternative useful way of thinking of the noise is suggested by introducing the normalized version of the state @xmath25 @xmath47 and rewriting ( [ eq:2 - 10 ] ) as @xmath48 we may interpret @xmath49 as a noise measure as well ; indeed , by choosing @xmath50 in ( [ eq:2 - 12 ] ) we have the correct normalization @xmath51 . as was noted in @xcite one may regard the random process with the measure @xmath52 as the output of the oscillator driven by vacuum fluctuations , i.  e.  a wiener process @xmath53 as input , @xmath54 here , we have intentionally restored the index @xmath8 on the quadrature component @xmath55 since the input - ouput connection ( [ eq:2 - 14 ] ) remains in fact valid for arbitrary values of the phase of the local oscillator .",
    "the two interpretations of the noise suggest different possibilities of calculating the means @xmath56 by numerical simulation .",
    "one , and in fact the simpler one , is to generate random numbers with the wiener measure @xmath57 , use them in evaluating @xmath25 , and then employ ( [ eq:2 - 10 ] ) . according to the second strategy one would again construct realizations of the wiener process and a set of ensuing @xmath25 but",
    "then proceed to the new measure @xmath58 and finally average as required in ( [ eq:2 - 12 ] ) .",
    "we should stress that the expectation value @xmath41 in the definition ( [ eq:2 - 14 ] ) is meant in the sense of the second strategy , i.  e.  conditioned on the measure @xmath58 for the past history @xmath42 , @xmath59 .",
    "we now propose a closer inspection of the measure @xmath52 for times @xmath60 .",
    "as already noted above we may    then drop the overlap @xmath61 , thus obtaining @xmath62,\\quad        t\\ll 1/\\gamma.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in writing out the measure @xmath63 more explicitly it is convenient to discretize the time as @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and to consider increments @xmath67 such that @xmath68 . assuming @xmath69 we then have @xmath70.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when averaging the mean displacement ( [ eq:2 - 9 ] ) with this measure we may first reduce @xmath63 to the marginal density of the single variable @xmath71 @xmath72 the two gaussians here appearing are not resolved from one another as long as their separation @xmath73 is smaller than their width @xmath74 .",
    "however , as soon as @xmath75 the density @xmath76 has two non - overlapping peaks .",
    "since the so - called decoherence time @xmath77 @xcite is , for strongly excited coherent states @xmath78 , much shorter than the mechanical life time of excitations @xmath37 , the separation in question takes place well within the range of validity @xmath79 of the various simplifications made in arriving at ( [ eq:2 - 17 ] ) .",
    "we may conclude that the displacement of the oscillator has an overwhelming likelihood , at all times in the interval @xmath80 , to take on either one or the other of two `` macroscopically '' distinguishable values rather than their vanishing ensemble average .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the density @xmath76 for various moments of time",
    ".    moreover , one intuitively expects jumps between the two macroscopically distinct values of @xmath41 to become less and less frequent as @xmath81 begins to exceed the decoherence time @xmath2 . in order to substantiate this expectation",
    "we consider the joint density @xmath82 with @xmath83 . by noting @xmath84 and doing the gaussian integrals we arrive at @xmath85    it is interesting to realize how the double - peak structure ( [ eq:2 - 17 ] ) of the single - point density generalizes to the two - point density ( [ eq:2 - 20 ] ) .",
    "in particular , the absence of cross terms @xmath86 suggests that there is no interference between what happens near @xmath87 and near @xmath88 . for a quantitative estimate of the frequency of jumps between the two branches we measure @xmath81 and @xmath89 in units of the decoherence time @xmath90 and evaluate the probability of finding @xmath5 within a width @xmath74 around the peak at @xmath91 , and @xmath92 within a width @xmath93 around the peak at @xmath94 , @xmath95\\nonumber\\\\    & & \\quad{\\text{and } } \\ \\theta'\\left(\\frac{\\tau'}{2\\gamma\\alpha^2 }      \\right)\\in\\left[\\frac{1}{\\alpha\\sqrt{\\gamma } }      \\left(\\tau'-\\sqrt{\\tau'/8}\\right),\\frac{1}{\\alpha\\sqrt{\\gamma } }      \\left(\\tau'+\\sqrt{\\tau'/8}\\right)\\right]\\bigg\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "we immediately obtain this `` jump probability '' as @xmath96 with the integration intervals @xmath97\\nonumber\\\\    \\text{i}_2 & = &     \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\tau-\\tau ' } }      \\left[-2\\tau'-\\tau x-\\sqrt{\\tau'/8}\\,,\\,-2\\tau'-\\tau x+        \\sqrt{\\tau'/8}\\right]\\nonumber\\\\       \\text{i}'_1&= &        \\left[2\\sqrt{\\tau}-1/\\sqrt{8}\\,,\\,2\\sqrt{\\tau}+         1/\\sqrt{8}\\right]\\nonumber\\\\       \\text{i}'_2 & = &         \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\tau'-\\tau } }       \\left[-\\tau x-\\sqrt{\\tau'/8}\\,,\\,-\\tau x+\\sqrt{\\tau'/8}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now first consider @xmath98 , @xmath99 .",
    "then the first summand in the jump probability ( [ eq:2 - 22 ] ) becomes negligibly small since @xmath100 covers a relatively small interval far out in the wing of the gaussian integrand ; the second summand in ( [ eq:2 - 22 ] ) , however , approaches a limit independent of @xmath101 since @xmath102 $ ] ; therefore , the jump probability @xmath103 is not small compared to unity .",
    "however , now consider what happens for large times , @xmath104 ; then both summands in ( [ eq:2 - 22 ] ) tend to become vanishingly small , i.  e.  of the order @xmath105 as @xmath106 grows large .",
    "indeed , once one has waited several decoherence times after the preparation of the cat state , jumps between the macroscopically distinguishable values @xmath107 become exceedingly unlikely .",
    "this behavior is fully borne out by numerical simulations , as exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] where two `` trajectories '' @xmath41 pertaining to two realizations of the noise @xmath26 are displayed .",
    "the foregoing reasoning makes for a certain temptation to associate single realizations of the noise @xmath26 and the accompanying @xmath41 with single runs of an experiment . we shall discuss the legitimacy of such an interpretation further below .",
    "it may be appropriate , however , to right away ease the temptation mentioned by throwing a glance at fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] which depicts a simulation of @xmath108 for a single realization of the noise @xmath109 .",
    "obviously , in contrast to @xmath110 the mean of the quadrature component @xmath111 shows no tendency towards choosing one of the two distinguished values @xmath112 ; even until times of the order of the mechanical relaxation time @xmath37 the mean @xmath33 stays close to zero before beginning to display some sizable fluctuations and then eventually quieting down at zero again for @xmath24 .",
    "this behavior @xcite of @xmath108 is easily understood by recalling the remark on the dependence of that mean on the phase @xmath8 of the local oscillator , made after ( [ eq:2 - 7 ] ) ; for @xmath113 one must wait until the overlap ( [ eq:2 - 8 ] ) of the two coherent states @xmath114 has grown to values of order unity before one can expect to see sizable fluctuations of the mean @xmath108 away from zero .",
    "in @xcite the linear stochastic schrdinger equation ( [ eq:2 - 1 ] ) was shown to be equivalent to the following nonlinear stochastic schrdinger equation @xmath115 where the mean displacement @xmath116 is meant with respect to the state @xmath117 itself , @xmath118 the noise increment @xmath53 represents a wiener process .",
    "the derivation of the nonlinear evolution equation ( [ eq:3 - 1 ] ) from the linear one , ( [ eq:2 - 1 ] ) proceeds in two steps @xcite .",
    "first , one interprets the noise @xmath4 in ( [ eq:2 - 1 ] ) as output noise driven by a wiener input @xmath53 according to ( [ eq:2 - 14 ] ) . by then normalizing as @xmath119 one arrives at ( [ eq:3 - 1 ] ) .",
    "this equation has been employed previously by several authors ( see e.  g.  @xcite ) .    due to the equivalence of the linear and the nonlinear stochastic schrdinger equation and due to the existence of a rigorous solution of the linear equation , it should also be possible to construct the exact solution of the nonlinear equation .",
    "this has in fact been achieved recently by carmichael , kochan and tian @xcite in the following way .",
    "one removes part of the nonlinearity from the nonlinear stochastic schrdinger equation ( [ eq:3 - 1 ] ) by working with the non - normalized wave vector @xmath120 ( see ( [ eq:3 - 3 ] ) ) , thus obtaining @xmath121 the ansatz @xmath122 yields an ito differential equation for the random process @xmath123 .",
    "the associated fokker - planck equation for the density @xmath124 happens to allow for the solution given in @xcite . after simplifying as before , i.  e.  @xmath125 , @xmath126 , the solution @xmath124 originating from @xmath127",
    "takes the form of a sum of two gaussians , @xmath128 which in structure resembles our density ( [ eq:2 - 17 ] ) of the output noise @xmath26 .",
    "it is most interesting to again see the width of each of the two gaussians grow as @xmath74 while their separation grows as @xmath81 , i.  e.  much faster .",
    "moreover , we again find the separation to become manifest after a time of the order of the decoherence time @xmath129 .",
    "the equivalence of the two versions ( [ eq:2 - 1 ] ) and ( [ eq:3 - 1 ] ) of the stochastic schrdinger equation is worth one more illustration .",
    "the nonlinear equation ( [ eq:3 - 1 ] ) is easily seen to imply the following equation for the mean @xmath130 defined in ( [ eq:3 - 2 ] ) , @xmath131 the ito integral of this equation takes the form @xmath132 obviously , we have arrived at an integral equation rather than an explicit solution .",
    "however , the equivalence of the integral equation ( [ eq:3 - 7 ] ) with the solution ( [ eq:2 - 9 ] ) of the linear schrdinger equation can clearly be seen with the help of eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 - 14 ] ) .",
    "imagine a spin 1/2 ( or equivalently , a two - level atom ) prepared in an eigenstate of the component @xmath133 with eigenvalue @xmath134 . in the @xmath135 representation that state will take the form    @xmath136 with @xmath137 .",
    "let , on the other hand , an harmonic oscillator be prepared in the vacuum state @xmath138 , with @xmath139 .",
    "if we couple the two systems impulsively according to the hamiltonian    @xmath140    we will produce the composite state @xmath141 in which the coherent state @xmath142 of the oscillator is correlated with the `` up '' state @xmath143 of the spin while the coherent state of the opposite amplitude , @xmath144 , is correlated with the spin - down - state @xmath145 .",
    "needless to say , the composite state ( [ eq:4 - 2 ] ) is not a cat state of the oscillator , even if the amplitude @xmath22 is large .    in order to proceed towards preparing a cat state",
    "we let the spin be exposed to a magnetic field in the @xmath146 direction such that spin states are transformed as @xmath147 this corresponds to a spin rotation by @xmath148 about the @xmath146 axis .",
    "the composite state ( [ eq:4 - 2 ] ) is thus transformed into @xmath149 now both eigenstates of @xmath135 are correlated with cat states of the oscillator , if @xmath18 .",
    "we may finally imagine a measurement of @xmath135 .",
    "every time we find @xmath150 we know that the oscillator is prepared in the cat state    @xmath151 .    in principle ,",
    "the thought experiment just sketched can be realized by playing with two level atoms traversing microwave or optical cavities .",
    "care would have to be taken that the two - step preparation takes less time than a decoherence time @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the damping constant of the cavity within which the cat state is to be produced .",
    "mostly employing a linear version of the stochastic schrdinger equation we have presented a rigorous description of the fate of an initial state of the cat type for the damped harmonic oscillator . while our description is stochastically equivalent to one using the master equation for the density operator , it has the additional appeal of being more closely related to individual runs of an experiment rather than to ensembles of such .",
    "indeed , the fate of the cat state described here makes for a certain temptation to associate a single realization of the noise @xmath26 and the accompanying mean displacement @xmath41 with a single run of an experiment .",
    "in fact , such an interpretation is known to be legitimate only with respect to balanced homodyne experiments where the output of the quantum oscillator is put to interference with a local oscillator of large amplitude and stable phase @xmath28 ; sharp values are then in effect recorded for the output noise @xmath26 of the quantum oscillator .",
    "inasmuch as the mean displacement @xmath41 tends to assume , for times in the interval @xmath154 , either one of the two values @xmath13 , one may even feel inclined towards regarding the displacement @xmath35 itself as a measured observable .",
    "the exceedingly small likelihood of jumps between the two preferred values @xmath13 during the time interval mentioned does permit some such indulgence .",
    "one must keep in mind , though , that both for early times , @xmath155 , and large times , @xmath156 , the displacement can not be considered as sharp in an individual run of the experiment ; nor can the quadrature component @xmath157 at any time .",
    "some further caution is indicated against hurried conclusions for quantum measurement theory .",
    "the heat bath providing the damping of the quantum oscillator is , strictly speaking , not the one needed for `` objectivation '' of sharp `` pointer readings '' ; nor is the displacement @xmath35 really playing the role of a pointer variable . in our context the quantum oscillator rather acts as a measured object and objectivation only arises in the photodetector which generates a macroscopic electric current .",
    "the pointer variable with respect to which the detector must secure decoherence , i.  e.  objectivation , is just the output noise @xmath26 for which sharp values are recorded .",
    "a striking manifestation of the potential `` nonobjectivity '' of the interaction of the oscillator with the heat bath may also be seen in the sensitive dependence of the statistics of @xmath158 on the phase @xmath8 of the local oscillator , discussed in section [ sec : linear ] and already noted in @xcite .",
    "astounding as that sensitivity may be , it does not make for worries in the context of quantum measurement theory ; while the phase of the local oscillator does not influence the interaction of the quantum oscillator with its damping reservoir , that phase does enter the oscillator observable coupled to the detector , i.  e.  the ouput noise @xmath26 .",
    "the interested reader is referred to zurek s discussion of `` pointer bases '' with respect to which fast decoherence takes place @xcite .",
