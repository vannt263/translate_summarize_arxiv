    "it is remarkable that the basis of some of the most fundamental theories of nature , such as general relativity and gauge theories , is the mathematics of fiber bundles .",
    "a fiber bundle is locally characterized by its curvature tensor ( the strength of the gauge field ) , and globally by its topological invariants .",
    "for example the quantization of the magnetic charge of a dirac monopole @xcite is equivalent to the quantization of the first chern number , @xmath8 , for the @xmath9 bundle over @xmath10 ( see @xcite and subsection [ subsec : chern number ] below ) . another well - known example is the @xmath11 instanton @xcite .",
    "the instanton number is given by the integral of the second chern character , @xmath12 , for the @xmath11 bundle over @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "under the influence of such topologically nontrivial background gauge field , the dynamics of the particles that interact with it is profoundly affected .",
    "for example wu and yang have shown that in the presence of a dirac monopole the orbital angular momentum quantum number of a charge @xmath14 particle can become odd integer multiples of @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "under such condition we need to generalize `` wave function '' to `` _ _ wave section _ _ '' which is patch - wise defined in space @xcite .",
    "the eigensections of the angular momentum are called _ monopole harmonics _",
    "@xmath16 , where @xmath17the magnetic charge .",
    "the allowed values of @xmath18 are multiples of half - integers , and the allowed values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 are : @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "thus half - integer @xmath18 gives half - integer @xmath19 , which means @xmath16 can form a complete representation of @xmath11 whereas ordinary spherical harmonics @xmath23 can only represent @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , without introducing the spinor structure , applying nontrivial field strength alone can lift the wave function representation to fulfill the universal covering group .    as stated above , the first chern number counts the number of fundamental monopoles enclosed by a 2-dimensional closed surface . in a 3-dimensional space ,",
    "field configurations with the same chern invariant may have different linking topologies for the loops of the magnetic lines .",
    "_ chern - simons invariant _ further distinguishes this topology . in this paper , in the spirit of wu and yang , we investigate the effect of self - linking magnetic field on charged particle dynamics . to make this problem tractable analytically",
    ", we consider a high- symmetry situation where the particle moves in a three - sphere @xmath0 .",
    "the vector potential is obtained from the berry connection of the two by two hamiltonian @xmath25 , where @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the pauli matrices @xcite . in order to produce linking flux lines ,",
    "the map @xmath5 is made to possess nontrivial homotopy . for a particular mapping ( @xmath6 ) the problem is exactly solvable .",
    "the resulting eigenfunctions are @xmath7 spherical harmonics , the same as those when the magnetic field is absent .",
    "the highly nontrivial magnetic field lifts the degeneracy in the energy spectrum in a way reminiscent of the zeeman effect .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : berry s phase ] , we briefly review the physics of berry s phase . in section [ sec : chern - simons",
    "] , we study the topological classifications by chern and chern - simons invariants . later , in section [ sec : shrodinger ] , with the help of berry connection , we construct the schrdinger equation in the presence of magnetic field with nontrivial chern - simons invariant .",

    "finally , in section [ sec : nonzero field ] , the schrdinger equation with magnetic field of nonzero chern - simons invariant is solved .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : discussion ] with a discussion of our results .",
    "in quantum mechanics , the overall phase of a wave function is often regarded as an irrelevant factor .",
    "berry pointed out that the phase may have observable consequences if the system undergoes an adiabatic change @xcite .",
    "in fact , berry s phase has a deep geometrical meaning with gauge nature @xcite and can be used to give the electromagnetic potential as showed in example [ ex : monopole 1 ] .",
