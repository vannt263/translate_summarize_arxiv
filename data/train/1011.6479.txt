    "the main objective in cancer phase i clinical trials is to identify a tolerable dose of a cytotoxic or therapeutic agent for subsequent studies .",
    "phase i trials represent the first testing of an investigational agent or combination of agents whose safety profile has been established individually .",
    "these trials typically enroll patients with advanced cancer stages and who have exhausted available standard treatment options @xcite .",
    "cancer phase i trials are carried out sequentially , assigning dose levels to subjects based on the observed side effects of the previously treated patients . from a safety and therapeutic perspective",
    ", these trials should be designed to minimize the number of unacceptable toxic events and maximize the number of patients treated at an optimal dose .",
    "ideally , the design should control the probability of overdosing patients at each stage of the trial , produce a sequence of doses that converge to the mtd , and should take into account the heterogeneous nature of cancer phase i trial patients @xcite .",
    "decisions to escalate or de - escalate dose levels in cancer phase i trials are made after one cycle of therapy to patients .",
    "the length of a cycle is usually between @xmath0 and @xmath1 weeks .",
    "therefore , the target phase i dose is typically defined in terms of treatment - related side effects , ignoring treatment efficacy .",
    "this is due to the fact that treatment efficacy , expressed as a reduction in tumor size or an increase in survival , requires months ( if not years ) of observation @xcite , a length of time far greater than the length of one cycle of therapy .",
    "thus , it can be stated that the main objective of a cancer phase i clinical trial is to determine a safe dose of a new drug or combination of drugs for subsequent clinical evaluation of efficacy .",
    "this dose is known as the maximum tolerated dose ( mtd ) , or phase ii dose .",
    "specifically , the mtd , @xmath2 , is defined as the dose expected to produce some degree of medically unacceptable , dose - limiting toxicity ( dlt ) in a prespecified proportion @xmath3 of patients @xcite , @xmath4    the target probability of dlt @xmath3 depends on the severity of the treatment - attributable toxicity .",

    "tighiouart , rogatko and babb @xcite introduced a class of correlated priors for @xmath105 on @xmath106\\times[x_{\\min } , \\infty)$ ] using truncated normal distributions for the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "they showed that a candidate joint prior for @xmath107 with negative a priori correlation structure results in a safer trial than the one that assumes independent priors for these two parameters while keeping the efficiency of the estimate of the mtd essentially unchanged .",

    "@xcite , tighiouart and rogatko @xcite , and xu , tighiouart and rogatko @xcite .",
    "the rationale behind this approach is that uncertainty about the mtd is high at the onset of the trial and a small value of @xmath108 offers protection against the possibility of administering dose levels much greater than the mtd . as the trial progresses , uncertainty about the mtd declines and the likelihood of selecting a dose level significantly above the mtd becomes significantly smaller .",
    "however , design operating characteristics were not studied .",
    "chu , lin and shih @xcite compared the performance of different versions of crm with ewoc with both constant and varying @xmath50 .",
    "the design of ewoc with varying @xmath50 was termed `` hybrid design . ''",
    "the authors conducted extensive simulations to compare these designs in terms of ( 1 ) the proportion of patients given doses above the `` true '' mtd and ( 2 ) the proportion of times the recommended dose is the `` true '' mtd after each patient is enrolled in the trial and his or her dlt status is resolved .",
    "it was found in general that both the hybrid and crm designs had better convergence rate than ewoc with fixed @xmath50 and that ewoc with fixed and varying feasibility bound @xmath50 provide a better overdose protection than the crm designs in the sense that fewer patients are given doses above the `` true '' mtd .",

    "the overprotection property of ewoc is with respect to the posterior distribution of the mtd , given the data .",
    "the overprotection property states that the posterior probability of exceeding the mtd given the current data is bounded by @xmath50 .",
    "this overprotection is as good as the posterior distribution of the mtd at each stage of the trial .",
    "for instance , if we used a flat prior on the mtd and the true mtd turns out to be very close to the initial dose , then it would take many patients for the median of the posterior distribution to cluster around the true mtd .",
    "another aspect of cancer phase i clinical trials not discussed here is the choice of the number of patients to enroll .",
    "most sample size recommendations in the literature are based on prespecified stopping rules ; see , for example , the work of zohar and chevret @xcite on selecting the number of patients by considering different stopping rules using the crm .",
    "lin and shih @xcite and ivanova @xcite described sample size recommendations based on the expected number of patients allocated to each dose selected from a set of prespecified dose levels .",
    "however , these methods apply to a prespecified set of discrete doses and it is not clear how they can be applied to continuous doses . unlike the frequentist approach , there is no consensus on a specific bayesian method for the sample size determination problem ; see the article by adcock @xcite for a review of bayesian approaches .",
    "we conducted extensive simulation studies in order to estimate the sample size based on a desired accuracy of the bayes estimate on the average .",
    "specifically , we determined the minimum number of patients so that the posterior variance of the mtd on the average over all possible trials is no more than a specified margin . tabulated values of the average mean posterior standard deviation , length of @xmath179 and @xmath126 hpd intervals for different values of the target probability of dlt @xmath180 are available from the authors upon request .",
    "the methodology described in this article assumes that dlt status is binary and does not account for patients time to toxicity .",
    "information on time to dlt is crucial to clinicians in that it permits a dynamic updating of the posterior distribution of the mtd based on the number of patients who experienced dlt and the ones who are still at risk .",
    "if new patients are eligible to enter the clinical trial while the dlt status of currently enrolled patients is still being resolved , then the new patients are allocated to the current established dose because it is not ethical to resolve dlt status at the expense of treatment delay . in this case",
    ", there is no adaptation to the most current information and the design will not be efficient .",
    "time to dlt was first investigated by cheung and chapell @xcite and later adapted to estimation of a maximum cumulative dose by braun et al .",
    "these methods are extensions of the crm and incorporate information on partially observed patients using weighted binomial likelihoods .",
    "ewoc can be adapted to this framework by modeling time to dlt as a cox @xcite type model with a parametric or nonparametric baseline risk of toxicity @xmath181 .",
    "we are currently investigating the performance of a large class of models within this framework via extensive simulations .",
