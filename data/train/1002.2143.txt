    "the solar optical telescope ( sot ) ( @xcite , @xcite ) onboard hinode @xcite has discovered ubiquitous tiny jets in the active region chromosphere , called chromospheric anemone jets , with ca h broadband filter observations @xcite .",
    "these jets are typically 37 arcsec ( 25 mm ) long , and 0.20.4 arcsec ( 0.150.3 mm ) wide , and their apparent velocity is 1020 km / s . their morphology shows the inverted y shape , which is quite similar to the shape of coronal x - ray anemone jet discovered by yohkoh ( @xcite , , @xcite ) .",
    "detailed observational analysis using magnetogram @xcite and magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations ( @xcite , ) of the x - ray anemone jet showed that the anemone shape is foamed as a result of magnetic reconnection , so it can be an indirect observational evidence of the magnetic reconnection in the solar corona .",
    "these findings have been recently confirmed and extended to even smaller x - ray jets with the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) onboard hinode ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the discovery of ubiquitous tiny chromospheric anemone jets suggests that these jets may be generated by the magnetic reconnection similar to that occurring in the corona .",
    "recently , @xcite reported in their preliminary observations that some of the footpoint of the jets correspond to the mixed magnetic polarities , suggesting reconnection in the photosphere or chromosphere .",
    "the total energy involved in a single chromospheric anemone jet was estimated to be 10@xmath10 erg , which is comparable to the energy of nanoflares proposed ideal by @xcite .",
    "hence it may be interesting to study the relation between these ubiquitous jets and the coronal heating , although at present the number of these jets are too small to explain the coronal heating @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that there are even more smaller jets or jet - like features in the chromosphere whose footpoints are not well resolved so by definition they can not be identified as the chromospheric anemone jet .",
    "( note that a chromospheric anemone jet has a bright footpoint that has an anemone shape , or inverted y shape structure . )",
    "there are number of unanswered questions concerning the chromospheric anemone jet , e.g. , what is the true velocity ( doppler velocity ) of these jets ?",
    "are mixed polarities universal at the footpoint of these jets ? what is the relation to other chromospheric jets , such as surges ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , h@xmath9 jets ( e.g. , @xcite ) , euv jets ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) , and spicules ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) ?",
    "the footpoint of chromospheric anemone jets reminds us of similar tiny brightening features , called ellerman bombs ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , , @xcite ) .",
    "so the question arises whether the footpoints of these jets correspond to the ellerman bombs .    in this paper",
    ", we report the first simultaneous observations of the chromospheric anemone jets with sot / hinode ca h broadband filter and ca k spectroheliogram on the domeless solar telescope ( dst ) at hida observatory @xcite . since the hinode / ca h filter is a broadband filter",
    ", it is not possible to derive velocity and other information such as occurrence height of the jets . using the spectroheliogram on dst",
    ", we first derived the true doppler velocity and height information of the chromospheric anemone jet . in this paper , we have made comprehensive analysis of the chromospheric anemone jets , also using sot / hinode magnetogram data as well as hida h@xmath9 filtergram , to develop an observation - based physical model of the jet .",
    "the paper is organized in the following manner : in section 2 , we present observational method for both hinode and hida observations , and in section 3 , we describe observational results for typical three examples of the chromospheric anemone jets in very detail .",
    "finally , we discuss the energy release rate and the physical model of the jets .",
    "in order to study evolution and dynamics of the chromospheric anemone jets and the related phenomena , we performed coordinated observations of the active region , using the sot / hinode broadband filter imager ( bfi ) of filtergraph ( fg ) and the 60  cm domeless solar telescope of the hida observatory , kyoto university .",
    "these observations were performed under the hinode observation plan 12 ( hop12 ) .",
