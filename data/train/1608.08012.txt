    "recent photometric and spectroscopic observations of gcs have established the presence of multiple stellar populations in most of the investigated galactic gcs ( e.g. , gratton et al . 2012 for a recent review ) .",
    "strong evidence for the multiple stellar populations includes , for example , the multiple main - sequence turn - offs and triple main sequence in @xmath4 cen and ngc 2808 ( e.g. , bedin et al .",
    "2004 ; piotto et al . 2005 ; 2007 ) , ubiquitous anti - correlations between light elements in most galactic gcs ( e.g. , carretta et at .",
    "2009 ) , and internal star - to - star variations in @xmath5-process elements in some massive gcs ( e.g. , yong et al . 2014 ; marino et al . 2015 ; m15 ) .",
    "these observations have raised a number of fundamental questions regarding the gc formation and evolution : ( i ) whether or not the presence of multiple stellar populations means the multiple generations of stars ( e.g. , bastian et al 2013 ; renzini et al .",
    "2015 ) , ( ii ) how the observed c - n and o - na anti - correlations can be explained by theoretical models based on the self - enrichment by asymptotic giant branch stars ( agb ) or fast - rotating massive stars ( frms ) in the early evolution of gcs ( e.g. , decressin et al . 2007 ;",
    "dercole et al .",
    "2008 ; d08 ) , and ( iii ) how multi - generation of stars can be successively formed in gcs ( e.g. , d08 ; bekki 2011 ; b11 ) .",
    "one of the key unresolved problems related to multiple stellar populations of gcs is the origin of ` anomalous gc ' with internal metallicity spreads ( @xmath6[fe / h]@xmath7 dex ) among gc stars ( see table 10 in m15 for a nice summary of chemical properties for the 8 anomalous gcs ) .",
    "each of these 8 gcs is observed to show internal spreads in chemical abundances of stars other than [ fe / h ] , such as c+n+o and @xmath5-process elements .",
    "for example , marino et al .",
    "( 2011 ) found that ( i ) m22 has at least two groups of stars with the [ fe / h ] difference of @xmath8 dex among the two groups , ( ii ) fe - rich group also shows a higher abundance of @xmath5-process element , and ( iii ) c - n and na - o anti - correlation can be seen in each of the two groups .",
    "yong et al .",
    "( 2014 ) have recently revealed the presence of three distinct populations with [ fe / h ] of @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 and internal abundance spreads in @xmath5-process elements in the galactic gc m2 and thus suggested that the formation history of m2 can be quite similar to other anomalous gcs such as @xmath4 cen ( see lardo et al .",
    "2013 for similar results on the abundance spread in m2 ) .",
    "internal abundance spreads in @xmath5-process elements , @xmath12-capture elements , and c+n+o are observed in ngc 1851 ( e.g. , yong & gundhahl ( 2008 ) , carretta et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , villanova et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , and youg et al .",
    "( 2014 ) .",
    "johnson et al . (",
    "2015 ) have recently investigated chemical properties of stars in ngc 6273 ( m19 ) , which is not listed as an anomalous gc in m15 , and found @xmath6[fe / h ] of @xmath13 dex among the gc stars , a significant [ la / fe ] enhancement in more metal - rich stars , and a possible third metal - rich population .",
    "lee et al .",
    "( 2009 ) investigated the @xmath14 index in rgb sequences of 37 galactic gcs and found that more than half of them show discrete or broad distributions of the @xmath14 index . if @xmath6[ca / h ] among gc stars is responsible for the observed broad @xmath14 index distribution , then self - enrichment by supernovae needs to occur in most of gcs at their formation phases .",
    "the number of anomalous gcs appears to be currently increasing whereas the latest observations of massive gcs ( e.g. , ngc 2808 and 47 tuc ) does not show large [ fe / h ] spreads ( e.g. , carreta 2015 ; milone et al . 2015 ; marino et al .",
    "these imply that chemical evolution processes in forming gcs is more complicated than previous theoretical models of gc formation predicted ( e.g. , dercole et al . 2008 ; b11 ) .    in spite of these recent observational developments , theoretical studies of gc formation",
    "have not yet discussed the origin of the observed unique chemical and dynamical properties of anomalous gcs extensively .",
    "bekki & yong ( 2012 , by12 ) discussed the origin of the stellar halo around ngc 1851 , which is one of anomalous gcs in the galaxy , in the context of gc formation from dwarf galaxy with stellar galactic nuclei .",
    "dantona et al .",
    "( 2016 ) have recently constructed a new model in which the detailed star formation history and chemical enrichment process by type ii supernovae and agb stars are derived for explaining the observed chemical abundances of the major five stellar populations in ngc 2808 .",
    "these recent theoretical studies , however , discussed either only the dynamical process of gc formation or only the chemical evolution process of forming gc .",
    "theoretical models that can predict both various chemical abundances ( e.g. , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17process elements ) and dynamical processes of gc formation and evolution ( e.g. , gc merging and tidal stripping of gc stars ) are thus required for better understating the origin of the anomalous gcs .",
    "the purpose of this paper is thus to investigate _ both _ dynamical evolution of gcs in host dwarf galaxies and chemical evolution of the gc hosts in order to make a more comprehensive understanding of the origin of the galactic anomalous gcs .",
    "we adopt a new dynamical model in which both gcs and their host dwarfs are represented by n - body particles in a fully self - consistent manner so that dynamical friction of gcs against field star and dark matter , gc merging , and tidal stripping of gc stars can be investigated .",
    "therefore , this model is significantly better than our previous model used in by12 .",
    "furthermore , using one - zone chemical evolution models for dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , tsujimoto 2011 , t11 ; tsujimoto & bekki 2013 ; tsujimoto & shigeyama 2014 ) , the present study investigates the time evolution of various chemical abundances , such as [ fe / h ] , [ ba / fe ] , and [ eu / fe ] and their dependences on the star formation histories and the initial stellar mass function ( imf ) .",
    "the results can be interpreted in the context of the chemical abundances of anomalous gcs .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "we describe the new dynamical evolution models of dwarf galaxies with two gcs orbiting around the galaxy in  2 .",
    "we present the numerical results on the possibility of gc merging in dwarfs and its dependence on the physical properties of gcs and dwarfs in  3 .",
    "we mainly discuss whether the large spreads in [ fe / h ] and @xmath5-process elements observed in the anomalous gcs can be possible in new gcs formed from gc merging using one - zone chemical evolution models in  4 .",
    "we provide important implications of the present results in terms of the origin of multiple stellar populations in gcs in this section in  5 .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in  6 .",
    "it should be noted that we do not numerically investigate the formation of gcs from gas clouds within high-@xmath18 dwarfs in the present paper : we have recently investigated how gcs can be formed from massive gas clumps formed in gas - rich dwarf galaxies using hydrodynamical simulations of dwarfs ( bekki 2016 ) .",
    "we adopt the gc merging scenario for the formation of anomalous gcs , which is illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "the present study consists of ( i ) dynamical simulations of gc mergers in gc - host dwarf galaxies and ( ii ) chemical evolution study of the gc hosts .",
    "we first investigates the dynamical evolution of two gcs in massive dwarf galaxies using our own original simulation code that can be run on gpu clusters ( bekki 2013 ) . in this first investigation ,",
    "the probability of gc merging and the merging timescale of two gcs in dwarfs are discussed in detail .",
    "although this dynamical simulations is similar to by12 , it is more sophisticated than by12 in that ( i ) two gcs are represented by n - body particles in a self - consistent manner and ( ii ) gcs can be represented by fg+sg systems or by fg - only systems .",
    "therefore , the present study can make more precise predictions on the dynamical fate of gcs in massive dwarfs .",
    "we also investigate the chemical evolution of dwarfs , in particular , the evolution of [ fe / h ] , [ @xmath5-process elements / fe ] , and [ @xmath19-process elements / fe ] in dwarfs , using one - zone chemical evolution models developed by t11 .",
    "the present study considers that chemical abundances of anomalous gcs can reflect the chemical evolution of their host dwarfs and thereby investigates the possible spreads in the above chemical abundances within gcs .",
    "we do not discuss self - enrichment processes in the formation of sg stars from ejecta from fg stars , because they have been discussed by many authors ( e.g. , fenner et al .",
    "2004 ; bekki et al .",
    "2007 ; dercole et al . 2010 ) .",
    "since the numerical methods for the dynamical evolution of dwarfs with gcs in the galaxy were already given in by12 , we briefly describe them below . for clarity",
    ", we describe the one - zone chemical evolution models originally developed by t11 and the results of the models in a separate section ,  4 .",
    "a gc - host dwarf galaxy is assumed to consist of a dark matter halo and a stellar disk without nucleus .",
    "both the dark matter halo and the stellar disk of the dwarf are represented by collisionless n - body particles .",
    "gas dynamics , star formation , chemical evolution , and dust formation are not included at all in the present study ( i.e. , the simulations are purely collisionless ones ) .",
    "the dark matter halo with with the total mass of @xmath20 is represented by the ` nfw ' one ( navarro et al .",
    "1996 ) with a central cusp predicted by the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model : @xmath21 where @xmath19 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are the distance from the center of the cluster , the central density , and the scale - length of the dark halo , respectively . the virial radius ( @xmath24 ) , the scale radius ( @xmath23 ) , and the ` @xmath25 ' parameter ( = @xmath26 )",
    "are chosen such that the values are consistent with recent cosmological simulations for the adopted @xmath20 ( neto et al .",
    "2007 ) .    for comparison",
    ", we also investigate the models with ` cored dark matter ' halos ( salucci & burkert 2000 ; sb profile ) , the density profile of which is described as follows : @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the central dark matter density multiplied by @xmath30 and the core ( scale ) radius , respectively .",
    "bekki et al .",
    "( 2003 ) already demonstrated that dwarf galaxies with sb profiles are more susceptible to tidal destruction by larger and more massive halos than those with nfw profiles and discussed the transformation of nucleated dwarfs into naked nuclei .",
    "therefore , we do not discuss much about dwarf destruction processes for dwarfs with sb profiles and gc evolution within them . we show the results for only one model with @xmath31 , @xmath32 kpc , and @xmath33 kpc .",
    "the dwarf is assumed to be as a bulge - less disk galaxy with the total stellar mass of @xmath34 and the size of @xmath35 .",
    "the radial ( @xmath36 ) and vertical ( @xmath37 ) density profiles of the stellar disk are assumed to be proportional to @xmath38 with scale length @xmath39 and to @xmath40 with scale length @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "in addition to the rotational velocity caused by the gravitational field of disk and dark halo components , the initial radial and azimuthal velocity dispersions are assigned to the disc component according to the epicyclic theory with toomre s parameter @xmath42 = 1.5 . the vertical velocity dispersion at a given radius",
    "is set to be 0.5 times as large as the radial velocity dispersion at that point .",
    "the stellar disk is assumed to have no stellar nucleus initially , which is different from the initial disk model adopted by by12 .",
    "a dwarf galaxy is assumed to have two gcs located in different regions within the dwarf .",
    "two gcs are denoted gc1 and gc2 for convenience , and they are represented by collisionless particles .",
    "gc1 and gc2 have different total mass ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively ) and distances ( @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively ) . for convenience ,",
    "the larger gc is referred to as gc1 in the present study .",
    "recent theoretical studies of gc formation have shown that new stars can be formed from gas ejecta from agb stars of gcs ( d08 , b11 ) .",
    "the new stars and the existing stars are often referred to ` sg ' and ` fg ' stars , respectively , and we adopt these abbreviations in the present paper .",
    "the sg systems are demonstrated by these previous works to be more compact than the fg ones , because sg stars can form in the deep potential wells of fg stellar systems . following these results",
    ", we mainly investigate ` two - component ' gc models in which a gc is composed of fg and sg systems with different masses ( e.g. , @xmath47 and @xmath48 for gc 1 ) and sizes ( @xmath49 and @xmath50 for gc1 ) . for comparison",

    "the mass - ratio of two gcs ( @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is always larger than or equal to @xmath55 ) is one of the most important parameters that can determine whether the gcs can merge with each other before the complete destruction of their host dwarfs .",
    "we mainly investigate the models in which @xmath56 ( i.e. , major gc merging ) , because by12 have shown that major merging is more likely to occur than minor merging with @xmath57 within dwarfs .",
    "vesperini et al .",
    "( 2013 ) investigated the dynamical evolution of gcs with fg and sg stars that have initially different spatial distributions using n - body simulations .",
    "they found that complete spatial mixing of the two stellar populations due to two - body relaxation is possibly only in the advanced stage of dynamical evolution .",
    "we do not discuss the two - body relaxation effects on the evolution of merged gcs with initially two populations in the present study , though it is a quite interesting issue .",

    "although these results are quite useful for understanding the origin of rotation in gcs ( e.g. , anderson & king 2003 ; bekki 2010a ) , we do not conduct such an extensive study of structural and kinematical properties of merged gcs , because our main interest is the probability of gc merging .",
    "we mainly investigated two models , ` the present ' and ` young ' galaxy ( milky way ; mw ) models to discuss the gc merging and stripping in early and late phases of the galaxy evolution .",
    "the model parameters for halo , bulge , and disk components of the galaxy are different between the present and young mw models . the galaxy in present mw models",
    "is assumed to have a _ fixed _ three - component gravitational potential and the orbit of the dwarf can be determined by the details of the potential for given its initial 3d positions , ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath18 ) , and 3d velocities , ( @xmath60,@xmath61,@xmath62 ) , with respect to the galactic center .",
    "the following logarithmic dark matter halo potential is adopted for the galaxy , @xmath63 where @xmath64 = 12 kpc , @xmath65 = 131.5 km @xmath66 and @xmath19 is the distance from the center of the galaxy .",
    "the gravitational potential of the galactic disk is represented by a miyamoto - nagai ( 1975 ) potential ; @xmath67 where @xmath68 = 1.0 @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 , and @xmath51 = 6.5 kpc , @xmath72 = 0.26 kpc , and @xmath73 . the following spherical hernquist ( 1990 ) model",

    "for the young mw models , the above three potential profiles with different parameters for the total masses of the three components are adopted : @xmath68 = 1.0 @xmath69 @xmath76 @xmath71 , @xmath75 = 3.4 @xmath69 @xmath78 @xmath71 , and @xmath65 = 93.0 km @xmath66 .",
    "this combination of parameters is chosen to mimic the young mw ( at the time of major gc formation ) with a possibly much lower mass and thus a lower maximum circular velocity .",
    "the epoch of dwarf accretion onto the galaxy can be quite different between different dwarfs with gcs and the galactic potential should be time - evolving owing to hierarchical mass accretion . by using the two extreme cases of the galactic gravitational potential , we try to understand how the galactic tidal field can influence gc merging during dwarf destruction .",
    "the 3d position of the galactic center is fixed at ( @xmath58,@xmath59,@xmath18 ) = ( 0,0,0 ) whereas the initial 3d position and velocity of a dwarf galaxy are free parameters that can determine the orbital evolution of the dwarf around the galaxy .",
    "the three basic parameters are ( i ) the initial distance of the dwarf from the galactic center ( @xmath79 ) , ( ii ) the initial velocity @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the circular velocity at @xmath79 and @xmath82 is a parameter that controls the orbital eccentricity and ranges from 0.1 ( highly eccentric orbit ) to 1 ( circular orbit ) . and ( iii ) the inclination angle between the galactic disk plane ( = the @xmath58-@xmath18 plane ) and the orbital plane of the dwarf ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "the initial @xmath58-component of the velocity of the dwarf is set to be 0 , which means that @xmath79 corresponds to the apocenter distance of the dwarf s orbit , because @xmath82 is always less than 1 .",
    "we mainly investigate the model ( ` standard orbit ' , defined as ` o1 ' ) in which @xmath79=17.5 kpc , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 , because dwarf galaxies can be destroyed almost completely within @xmath86 gyr in this model .",
    "we also investigate models with different @xmath79 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 in order to investigate how the details of the orbital evolution of dwarfs can influence the merging processes of gcs .",
    "the initial angle between the stellar disk of a dwarf and the orbital plane of the dwarf is 60 degrees for all models in the present study .",
    "although we investigated numerous models ( 56 models ) , we present the results of 19 representative models , for which the model parameters are described in table 1 .",
    "the model parameters for 6 dwarf galaxy models investigated in the present study ( d1-d6 ) and the adopted orbits of the dwarfs ( o1-o4 ) are summarized in table 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "two gcs are assumed to exist initially in a simulated dwarf , because we think that the time delay between the formation epochs does not influence their evolution within the dwarf .",
    "we mainly show the results of the fiducial model ( m1 ) with the dwarf galaxy model d1 ( @xmath87 @xmath88 ) @xmath89 , @xmath90 pc , @xmath91 ( the mass - ratio of two gcs ) , @xmath92 pc , @xmath93 pc , and the standard orbit model o1 , because it clearly shows a typical behavior of gc merging in a massive dwarf galaxy being destroyed by the galaxy .",
    "we mainly focus on the possibility and timescale of gc merging in dwarf galaxies and their dependency on model parameters such as @xmath20 and @xmath94 .",
    "the timescale of gc merging ( @xmath95 ) for each model is given in table 1 .",
    "we define @xmath95 as the time when ( i ) the separation of two gcs becomes less than 10pc and ( ii ) the separation becomes the minimum for the first time . the above condition ( i )",
    "is necessary , because some models do not show gc merging .",
    "we also investigate the fraction of sg stars in the halo regions around merged gcs in order to discuss the observed physical properties of stellar halos around gcs ( e.g. , olszewski et al . 2009 ) .",
    "gc merging process can be influenced by the presence of stellar galactic nuclei , however , we do not discuss this possible important effect in the present study .",
    "appendix a discusses briefly this issues using a few models with stellar galactic nuclei .",
    "we investigate the evolution of dwarfs with gcs over 2.82 gyr and 5.64 gyr for the models with smaller @xmath79 ( = 8.5 and 17.5 kpc ) larger initial @xmath79 ( 35 kpc ) , respectively .",
    "we run a low - mass dwarf model ( @xmath96 ) without gcs ( m19 ) in order to show the orbit of a dwarf that is not influenced by gcs ( e.g. , dynamical friction ) and stripped field stars for a given gravitational potential : a dwarf s orbit defined by the time evolution of the position of the central star can be slightly influenced by massive gcs and stripped stars .",
    "gcs can continue to lose a significant fraction ( @xmath97% ) of their stars through two - body relaxation and tidal stripping by the galactic tidal field over the time scale of @xmath98 gyr ( e.g. , vesperini 1997 ; vesperini et al .",
    "these long - term effects are not properly included , because we run simulations for only @xmath99 gyr .",
    "accordingly , the final masses of gcs could be larger than the observed ones in the present study .",
    "for example , if the present - day mass of m22 is @xmath100 ( e.g. , marks & kroupa 2010 ) , then its mass before losing stars through the above long - term dynamical effects should be at least @xmath101 .",
    "the initial mass of m22 at its birth could be even by a factor of @xmath102 larger than this @xmath101 , because fg stars can be lost during the early evolution of gcs ( e.g. , dercole et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "we use a newly revised , more sophisticated version of our original simulation code adopted in by12 so that we can investigate not only global dynamical evolution of dwarf galaxies influenced by the galactic tidal field but also the orbital evolution of gcs within them .",
    "the time integration of the equation of motion is performed by using 2nd - order leap - flog method with the maximum time step interval being @xmath103 yr for particles in a dwarf galaxy and @xmath104 yr for particles representing gcs .",
    "the adopted individual time step scheme with rather small time step interval for gc stars enables the present study to investigate gc merging more properly than by12 , because such scheme was not introduced by by12 .",
    "the total number of particles for dark matter , stellar disk , gc of a dwarf galaxy is 500,000 , 500,000 , and 60,000 , respectively .",
    "the fg and sg systems are represented by 20000 and 10000 collisionless particles in all models .",
    "only a limited amount of computations time is allocated for the research project on which the present study is based and we need to run at least @xmath97 models with different model parameters in the present investigation . we therefore consider that the total number particle of @xmath105 is reasonable ( not numerically costly ) that we can adopt for each model .",
    "the gravitational softening lengths ( @xmath106 ) for dark matter halo , stellar disk , fg system , and sg system ( of a gc ) are denoted as @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 , respectively .",

    "figure 3 shows how the spatial distributions of field stars of a dwarf disk galaxy and stars from fg and sg systems in two gcs evolve with time during the accretion of the dwarf onto the galaxy in the fiducial model m1 .",
    "this model corresponds to a later accretion of a dwarf onto the present galaxy so that the strong tidal field of the galaxy can rapidly destroy the dwarf within @xmath86 gyr .",
    "a significant fraction of fg stars can be efficiently stripped from gc1 and gc2 by the dwarf s tidal field while the two gcs are orbiting around the host dwarf ( @xmath113 gyr ) .",
    "these stripped fg stars spread over the entire disk region of the dwarf ( @xmath114 gyr ) and then are stripped from the dwarf while the stellar disk component of the dwarf is being destroyed by the galactic tidal field ( @xmath115 and 2.24 gyr ) . after the complete destruction of the dwarf by the galactic tidal field , the new gc ( or naked nucleus ) can continue to lose their fg and sg stars with fg stars being more efficiently stripped by the tidal field .",

    "the final total mass of gc stars at @xmath117 gyr is @xmath118 for @xmath119 pc and @xmath120 for @xmath121 pc .",
    "since the dynamical friction of gcs against disk field stars of the dwarf is quite effective owing to the lower velocity dispersion of field stars ( bekki 2010b ) , the two gcs can spiral into the central region of the dwarf and finally merge with each other . as shown in figure 4",
    ", the two gcs can rather quickly merge to form a new gcs ( a single nuclear gc ) at @xmath122 gyr .",

    ". a significant fraction of the fg stars can be stripped to form a stellar halo during gc merging .",
    "the final remnant of gc merging can have diffuse fg and compact sg system , and the remnant can still have a nested structure ( @xmath114 gyr ) .",
    "the stellar halo around the new gc is quite extended within its host dwarf and the halo is dominated by fg stars at @xmath113 gyr when the new gc can be identified as an off - center nucleus .",
    "thus , this fiducial model demonstrates how two massive gcs with fg and sg stars can be transformed into one new gc with four distinct stellar populations ( i.e. , original fg and sg stars from gc1 and gc 2 ) during the destruction of their host galaxies .",
    "figure 5 shows how the mass fractions of disk field stars of the dwarf ( @xmath123 ) depends on the distance ( @xmath36 ) from the center of the remnant of gc merging .",
    "the mass fraction is not so large ( @xmath124% ) in the halo region of the new gc ( @xmath125 pc ; original radius of the fg system ) at @xmath117 gyr , which means that the field stars can not be tidally captured by the merged gc so efficiently in this model . these stars that are gravitationally trapped within the merged gc ( i.e. , those with their velocities less than the escape velocity of the gc ) are mostly from the inner regions of the dwarf .",

    "the @xmath19-process yield from a neutron star merger is assumed as follows .",
    "we adopt the ejecta mass of a neutron star merger is 0.01 @xmath154 . since the frequency of neutron star mergers is estimated to be one per a few 1000 sne ii ( tsujimoto & shigeyama 2014 ) , we determine its frequency within the possible range so as to be the nucleosynthetic [ eu / fe ] ratio of + 0.5 as observed in m22 or galactic halo stars , where the fe yield is the average from an sn ii : in this case , the predicted ( calculated ) [ eu / fe ] exactly becomes + 0.5 .",

    "we do not consider the contribution from type ia sne ( sne ia ) since no signature of chemical enrichment by sne ia is seen in the ratio of @xmath158-elements to fe for the two populations of m22 .",
    "this assumption seems incompatible with the delay time distribution of sne ia obtained from the studies on the sn ia rate in distant and nearby galaxies , which claim that sne ia start from a @xmath159 yrs delay from the initial star formation ( e.g. , maoz et al .",

    "the best model denoted by the red solid line broadly reproduces the correlation of [ ba / fe ] and [ fe / h ] corresponding to the two populations of m22 with a short timescale of a few @xmath161 yrs .",
    "comparison of this model result with that for the model with a high @xmath153 of 50@xmath156 ( black dot - dashed line ) reveals that an efficient ba enrichment in comparison with fe enrichment is realized by introducing a small @xmath153 .",
    "it is attributed to the result that a small @xmath153 yields a reduction in the fe mass ejected from each generation of sne ii , whereas the amounts of s - process elements synthesized in low - mass agb stars remain unchanged .",
    "it should be noted here that the time evolution of [ ba / fe ] is rather rapid ( i.e. , steeper age - dependence of [ ba / fe ] ) for ages less than 0.5 gyr and then it becomes less rapid ( i.e. , flatter [ ba / fe]-age relation ) .",
    "this might have some constraints on the formation epochs of two gcs that finally merge with other to form a single anomalous gc in dwarfs : larger [ ba / fe ] differences in earlier formation of anomalous gcs via merging .",
    "as shown in the upper panel of figure 8 , the model with low sfr and low @xmath153 ( blue short - dashed line ) has an almost same trend of [ ba / fe ] evolution as obtained for the best model , which suggests that the rapidity of sf does not much influence the evolution of [ ba / fe ] in dwarf galaxies .",
    "however , this model with low sfr shows ( i ) a rather low [ fe / h ] that is not consistent with [ fe / h ] of metal - poor gcs ( [ fe / h]@xmath162 ) and ( ii ) a very slow [ fe / h ] evolution that can not cause a significant [ fe / h ] difference of @xmath163 dex after 0.3 gyr , as required for the case of the host of m22 .",
    "these results of three models therefore clearly demonstrate that both high sfr and lower @xmath153 are required for explaining both the increase of [ ba / fe ] by @xmath164 dex and that of [ fe / h ] by @xmath8 dex within @xmath164 gyr chemical evolution of dwarf galaxies .",
    "it it our future work to investigate how such a rapid sf with lower @xmath153 is possible for gc - host dwarf galaxies .",
    "the upper panel of figure 9 shows the time evolution of [ eu / fe ] for the best model , which is assumed to be `` massive '' dwarf galaxies such as the fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( see  5.3 for the discussion on how the results depend on the stellar masses ) . in this model ,",
    "mergers between neutron stars ( ` ns - ns merger ' ) can occur so that [ eu / fe ] can be kept constant ( e.g. , tsujimoto & shigeyama 2014 ) .",
    "however , the evolution of [ eu / fe ] in low - mass dwarf galaxy models can not be constant as this best model , because ns - ns merger is an extremely rare event ( i.e. , almost no ns - ns mergers , which end up with a decreasing trend of [ eu / fe ] with [ fe / h ] ) .",
    "the lower panel of figure 9 shows that the time evolution of [ ba / eu ] is very similar to that of [ ba / fe ] in figure 8 , which is totally expected for a flat evolution of [ eu / fe ] in massive dwarf galaxies ( tsujimoto & shigeyama 2014 ) .",
    "these results in figure 9 suggest that [ eu / fe ] and [ ba / eu ] of gcs have fossil information of the chemical evolution of their host dwarfs .",
    "although the present one - zone chemical evolution model can reproduce the observed [ ba / fe ] difference in the two populations of m22 reasonably well , it can not simply explain the observed difference in [ ( c+n+o)/fe ] in the two populations ( fig .",

    "this threshold gc mass for the formation of sg stars has already been discussed by several authors ( e.g. , d08 ; b11 ; conroy & spergel 2011 ) .",

    "if this @xmath95 is shorter than the destruction timescale of gc host dwarf ( @xmath136 ) by the galactic tidal field during dwarf accretion onto the galaxy , then anomalous gcs with metallicity spreads can form from gc merging .",
    "if @xmath95 is longer than @xmath136 , then gcs are stripped from their host dwarfs before gc merging and consequently become the galactic ` normal ' gcs . since the dynamical friction process of gcs within dwarfs is a key determinant for @xmath95 , @xmath183 and mass densities and kinematics of field stars can control @xmath95 .",

    "the fourth parameter is @xmath136 , which can control the duration of star formation in dwarfs .",
    "star formation can last longer in more massive dwarfs , because they are more likely to be disrupted by the galactic tidal fields more slowly .",
    "if @xmath136 in a massive dwarf is as long as several gyr , then chemical enrichment in the central region can lead to a very large [ fe / h ] spread and a significant contribution of low - mass agb stars to the evolution of @xmath5-process elements .",
    "the stellar nucleus or nuclear cluster in the dwarf can therefore show large abundance spread in different elements ( like @xmath4 cen ) .",
    "the fifth parameter is @xmath143 ( the mass - ratio of a gc to its host galaxy s dark matter halo ) , which controls the capability of merged gcs to capture field stars .",
    "gcs in dwarfs with higher @xmath143 are more likely to have field stars within them after gc merging , and these field stars are not initially in gcs and later captured by the gcs .",
    "these captured field stars may well be observed as anomalous metal - rich stars in anomalous gcs .",
    "figure 11 illustrates how the five parameters determine the levels of internal abundance spreads of gcs and table 4 summarizes the physical meaning of the five parameters : this is just one of possible unified scenarios of gc formation .",
    "there are only five different classes of gcs in this illustration and only one proto - type of each gc class is shown just for clarity . in this scenario ,",
    "the levels of internal abundance spreads in gcs depend not only on the physical properties of gcs ( @xmath183 ) but also on the chemical and dynamical histories of their host gcs .",
    "this scenario is based on _ separate _ investigation of chemical and dynamical evolution of gcs and their host dwarfs , and accordingly they are not fully self - consistent .",
    "it is thus our future study to investigate how the chemical properties of gcs depend on their formation processes and the evolution of their host dwarfs using chemodynamical simulations of galaxy formation with a model for gc formation .",
    "using dynamical simulations of dwarf galaxies with gcs and chemical evolution models , we have investigated ( i ) merging processes of gcs in their host dwarf galaxies , ( ii ) stripping of gcs from their host dwarfs , ( iii ) tidal capture of field stars by merging gcs , ( iv ) final kinematics of merged gcs , and ( v ) various chemical abundances ( e.g. , [ fe / h ] and [ ba / fe ] ) of merged gcs . the present dynamical simulation is better than by12 in that both gcs and their host dwarf galaxy are represented by n - body particles .",
    "furthermore , the present study has considered that the chemical evolution of gc host dwarfs are linked to the internal abundance spreads of gc stars .",
    "the main results are summarized as follows .",
    "+ ( 1 ) merging between massive gcs with their masses ( @xmath185 ) larger than @xmath186 @xmath88 is inevitable in their host dwarf galaxies with @xmath187 $ ] @xmath88 because of more efficient dynamical friction of the gcs against disk field stars in the host dwarfs .",
    "given that the time scale of gc merging ( @xmath95 ) is less than a few gyr in these massive dwarfs , the merged gcs can become off - center nuclei before their hosts are completely destroyed by the galactic tidal field .",
    "these results do not depend on whether gcs have both two generations ( i.e. , fg and sg ) of stars or just single generation of stars . +",
    "( 2 ) low - mass gcs with @xmath188 @xmath88 can not lose their orbital energy and angular momentum efficiently so that they can not sink rapidly into the central regions of their hosts .",
    "therefore they are more likely to be tidally stripped from their host dwarfs before gc merging to become ` normal ' gcs ( with c - n and na - o anti - correlations ) .",
    "this result combined with the above result ( 1 ) strongly suggests that gc masses can distinguish between normal gcs and anomalous ones with [ fe / h ] spreads .",
    "it has long been suggested that chemical enrichment of intra - cluster gas through gas ejection from type ii supernovae might proceed more efficiently in more massive gcs and consequently cause [ fe / h ] spreads among gc stars .",
    "the present study suggests that simple gc - gc merging can also equally explain the observed [ fe / h ] spreads in anomalous gcs .",
    "+ ( 3 ) if the formation epochs of two gcs in dwarfs are separated by @xmath3 myr , then the chemical abundances of [ fe / h ] and [ ba / fe ] can be different by 0.15 dex and 0.3 dex , respectively , owing to chemical enrichment by agb stars and supernovae within the dwarfs .",
    "however , star formation in the gc - host dwarfs needs to proceed rather rapidly to obtain such rapid chemical enrichment , and the upper - mass cutoff ( @xmath153 ) of imf can influence the chemical evolution .",
    "the internal abundance spreads of merged gcs depend both on the star formation histories of their host dwarfs and on the time lag between two gc formation events .",
    "we suggest that star formation histories of dwarfs hosting anomalous gcs can be different from dwarfs hosting normal gcs .",
    "the observed no / little dependence of [ eu / fe ] on [ fe / h ] in m22 is consistent with a scenario in which m22 was formed in a massive dwarf galaxy at a high redshift .",
    "+ ( 4 ) field stars can be captured by merged gcs in the central regions of gc - host dwarfs , if the mass - ratios of gcs to their hosts are large ( @xmath189 ) .",
    "the chemical abundances of these field stars should be different from those of stars initially in merging gcs .",
    "we suggest that metal - rich ` anomalous stars ' observed in some gcs ( e.g. , ngc 6273 ; johnson et al .",
    "2015 ) can be formed as a result of tidal capture of field stars by merging gcs within dwarfs .",
    "as already discussed in by12 , stellar halos can be formed around merged gcs after tidal destruction of their host dwarfs .",
    "+ ( 5 ) gc merger remnants inevitably show global rotation , because orbital angular momentum of merging gcs is converted into internal rotation of the remnants .",
    "the present study has investigated only merging of gcs with initially no net global rotation ( i.e. , dense stellar systems dynamically supported only by velocity dispersion ) and found that the rotation amplitude is only @xmath190 km s@xmath127 for @xmath191 @xmath88 .",
    "the stellar kinematics of gc merger remnants could depend on the initial stellar kinematics of merger progenitor gcs , which should be investigated in our future works .",
    "+ ( 6 ) the details of chemical abundances in anomalous gcs can depend on the time lag between two gc formation events , the timescale of gc host destruction , and the chemical evolution processes of gc host dwarfs , if they were formed mainly from gc merging .",
    "the time lag between the formation epochs of two gcs that finally merge to form a single gc is very short for the case of ngc 1851 with little / no [ fe / h ] spread whereas it should be at least a few myr in the merger scenario of anomalous gcs with significant [ fe / h ] spreads : gc merging alone does not necessarily form single anomalous gcs in this scenario . @xmath4",
    "cen could possibly have experienced both multiple gc merging and gas inflow from the outer part of its host dwarf for a longer time scale so that it could have a very large [ fe / h ] spread .",
    "the unique history of @xmath4 cen needs to be discussed in detail by a separate paper .",
