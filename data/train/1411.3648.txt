    "some years ago we proposed @xcite",
    "@xcite @xcite @xcite that the constant @xmath2 ( the speed of light ) and the expansion of the universe are two aspects of one single concept connecting space and time in the expanding universe by putting ( with coordinates normalized to the present epoch ) @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a constant , where @xmath5 is the cosmic scale factor and where it must be emphasized that @xmath6 is constant .",
    "this equation ( [ c ] ) lead us to propose a cosmological model one of its interests being to drastically reduce the number of problems of standard cosmology . among our results",
    ", we showed that eq.([c ] ) leads to interpret the distance modulus vs. redshift curve _ without having to consider any acceleration of the universe_. recently quite independently and from statistical considerations , harmut traunmller @xcite , using data on magnitude and redshift from 892 type 1a supernovae showed that a statistical study suggests that for standard candles , `` magnitude @xmath7 + const.$ ] gives the best fit of all results '' so that @xmath8 this last expression being exactly the one we obtain @xcite with ( [ c ] ) , we come back to this result .",
    "we also show that our result agrees with a high precision with the one obtained in the range of @xmath9 to @xmath10 by marosi @xcite who compared the hubble diagram calculated from the observed redshifts data of 280 supernovae with hubble diagrams inferred on the basis of different cosmological models .",
    "to calculate the expression for the distance modulus @xmath11 with respect to @xmath12 let us consider an object at cosmic coordinate @xmath13 and let us suppose that the light that is emitted at cosmic time @xmath14 is just reaching us at time @xmath15 .",
    "let us also write the robertson - walker metric ( with coordinates normalized to the present epoch and @xmath16 ) in the form @xmath17 using ( [ c ] ) which obviously gives @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 is the hubble constant at time @xmath15 ) the luminosity distance @xmath21 of the object can be expressed as @xmath22 @xmath13 can be obtained by writing that light travels on a radial null geodesic so that @xmath23 . using ( [ c ] ) we thus have : @xmath24 introducing this result into eq.([dl1 ] ) with @xmath25 , gives @xmath26 the distance modulus",
    "is related to the luminosity distance via @xmath27 so that introducing @xmath21 into that equation gives @xmath28 that equation which we found in @xcite is exactly the one that harmut traunmller @xcite found quite independently as being the best to interpret the observations of 892 type 1a supernovae . +     vs. redshift @xmath12 ) .",
    "the unbroken line represents predictions from eq.([c ] ) and ( [ mu ] ) ( we take @xmath29 ) .",
    "all data points are taken from hao wei paper @xcite . the dotted line ( which is barely visible because it is so close to our result ) corresponds to the best function ( @xmath30 ) obtained by marosi @xcite .",
    "[ fig 1 ] ]    fig(1 ) shows our result for @xmath11 vs.@xmath12 ( all data points are taken from the paper of hao wei @xcite ) .",
    "it exactly corresponds to the one ( [ ht ] ) of harmut traunmller @xcite",
    ". it also agrees with the one of marosi @xcite ( dotted line in fig.1 ) who , comparing the hubble diagram calculated from the observed redshift data of 280 supernovae with hubble diagrams inferred on the basis of two cosmological models in the range of z = 0.0104 to 8.1 , found that the best way to represent observations would be expressed by @xmath31 calculating the difference between ( [ mu ] ) and ( [ mub ] ) in fact shows that , at worst , his numerical values agree with ours within at worst @xmath32 ( this worst value being obtained for @xmath33 ) .",
    "this agreement explains that marosi s result is barely visible in fig.1 ( dotted line ) because it is so close to our result .",
    "although the supernovae results are interpreted in the standard cosmology as indicating an accelerating universe , the first point to emphazise is that the result ( [ mu ] ) is obtained _ without having to consider at all such an acceleration of the expansion _",
    "( and consequently without having to solve related problems ) .",
    "eq.([c ] ) in fact leads to the deceleration parameter @xmath34 .",
    "+ it can be also noted that our result does not depend on @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 and that however it directly gives the expected result without having to adjust any parameter .",
    "+ in the standard model the general expression of the luminosity distance @xmath21 can be expressed in terms of an integral over the redshift @xmath38 of the propagating photon as it travels from @xmath38 to us at @xmath39 .",
    "we thus have in that case : @xmath40 with @xmath41 the reason why our eq.([mu ] ) does not depend on @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 comes from the fact that using eq.([c ] ) implies a variation with time ( more precisely as @xmath42 ) of the cosmological constant which is not the case for calculations leading to ( [ pee ] ) .",
    "+ of course , our numerical value for @xmath20 is different from the one obtained in the standard cosmology model but it must be underlined that the same observations do nt lead , within a given model , to the same numerical values in another one",
    ". it would consequently be fallacious to judge a model with the presuppositions of another one .",
    "at the price of accepting a variation with time of the cosmological `` constant '' and a density of the universe varying as @xmath42 ( so that the mass of the universe varies as @xmath5 ) , the cosmological model we deduced from eq.([c ] ) allows to reduce and enlights a number of problems of the standard cosmology .",
    "we know that it may raise questions and so we will present it in more details .",
    "+ however , we can not think that such an agreement between our eq.([mu ] ) and that of traunmller @xcite and of marosi @xcite could be a fortuitous coincidence . noting that the reason of such an agreement comes from eq.([c ] ) which gives @xmath43 and thus introduces the @xmath44 in the result , we are forced to consider the interest of eq.([c ] ) .",
    "+ the constant c was first introduced as the speed of light .",
    "however , with the development of physics , it came to be understood as playing a more fundamental role , its significance being not directly that of a usual velocity ( even though its dimensions are ) and one might thus think of @xmath6 as being a fundamental constant of the universe . moreover , the advent of einsteinian relativity , the fact that @xmath6 does appear in phenomena where there is neither light nor any motion ( for example in the fundamental equation @xmath45 ) and its double - interpretation in terms of velocity of light and of velocity of gravitation forces us to associate it with the theoretical description of space - time itself rather than that of the phenomena taking place there so we have connected the two . for this purpose",
    ", we note that there are two universal relations connecting space and time ( one is given by the einstein s constant @xmath6 and the other appears in the expansion of the universe ) and we consider as a logical necessity that there are not two different universal relations between space and time having the same physical dimension of a velocity .",
    "we are thus lead to tie the two .",
    "equation ( [ c ] ) thus gives a physical interpretation of @xmath6 and shows that @xmath6 can be defined solely from the knowledge of the geometry of space - time , that is from its size and its age .",
    "+ eq.([c ] ) , thus gives _ mathematically _ to @xmath6 the status of a fundamental geometrical constant of the universe , a status that everybody admits without ever giving it any mathematical formulation or any physical origin .",
