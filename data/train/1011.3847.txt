    "@xmath20    a direct corollary of this lemma is    [ thm fcc main ] the irreducibility classes of the fcc elementary move , applied to unrooted polygons in the fcc , coincides with the knot types of the polygons as piecewise linear embeddings in @xmath7 .    _",
    "proof : _ observe that since @xmath138 is a sublattice of the fcc which is isotopic to the simple cubic lattice , the irreducibility classes of the fcc elementary move applied to unrooted polygons in @xmath221 coincides with the knot types of the polygons as piecewise linear embeddinds in @xmath7 .",
    "this follows directly from the observation above that all bfacf moves on a polygon in @xmath138 can be induced by using the fcc elementary move , and from theorem  [ thm 11 ] or theorem  3.11 in reference @xcite .    by lemma  [ lemma c ]",
    "any unrooted polygon in the fcc can be ( reversibly ) swept into the sublattice @xmath138 using the fcc elementary move .",

    "the positive move @xmath210 in @xmath83 is a bfacf move , and it is performed in two steps in the fcc by @xmath222 , since @xmath223 and @xmath224 .",
    "the other cases , and neutral and negative sc bfacf moves can similarly be checked .    hence , since the standard sc bfacf moves in figure  [ figa4 ] can be performed on the polygon in @xmath138 , using composite fcc elementary moves , the theorem follows immediately .",
    "in this paper we have shown that the bfacf elementary moves on simple cubic lattice polygons can be generalised to similar moves on the bcc and fcc lattices . for the bcc lattice",
    ", we propose a set of four elementary moves ( two are neutral , and two are positive / negative ) , while on the fcc lattice we propose a single ( reversible ) elementary move ( of type positive / negative ) .",
    "we proved that , on the bcc and fcc lattices , these moves are suitable to give irreducibility classes of unrooted polygons that coincide with the knot types of the polygons .",
    "this is , we have generalised theorem  3.11 in reference @xcite to both the fcc and bcc lattices . for the bcc lattices , our method of proof relied on all four proposed elementary moves and so we know that these moves are sufficient .",
    "it is not clear that any of these are necessary , or that a smaller set of similarly defined elementary moves may be sufficient .    using the proposed moves we have implemented the gas algorithm @xcite to sample knotted polygons on both the fcc and bcc lattices .",
    "we give some results in table  [ table ] and further numerical results will be published elsewhere .      in the gas implementation @xcite of the algorithm , lattice polygons of ( fixed ) knot type @xmath86",
    "are sampled along a markov chain by executing the elementary ( or atmospheric ) moves on the polygons .",

    "the expected value of the weight of sequences ending in states of length @xmath260 is @xmath261 , and the basic gas theorem states that @xmath262 where @xmath263 are all possible sequences of states ending in a state of length @xmath264 , and @xmath265 are all the possible sequences of states ending in a state of length @xmath266 .    in this implementation ,",
    "the fcc and bcc elementary moves described in this paper will give an approximate enumeration algorithm , and estimates of the number of polygons of knot type @xmath86 and length @xmath4 , @xmath267 , can be obtained .",
    "this approach produced the data in table [ table ] .",
    "the gas algorithm is by no means a standard simulation method ( though the authors hope that it might become more popular ) , and so we finish the paper by discussing how the proposed moves may be implemented in a bfacf - style algorithm , as implemented in reference @xcite ; further implementations can be found in references @xcite .    in general the bfacf algorithm",
    "is applied to either a self - avoiding walk or self - avoiding polygons and so we will discuss the implementation of the bcc and fcc moves to sample either walks or polygons . since these moves do not translate the endpoints of a self - avoiding walk , assume that the walk is rooted at its endpoints .",
    "the simple cubic lattice moves are not irreducible on the state space @xmath268 of walks with fixed endpoints @xmath269 ( the origin ) and a lattice site @xmath270 @xcite unless those endpoints are a distance of at least 2 apart ( for details , see reference @xcite ) .",
    "we believe that a similar result will hold for the bcc and fcc moves we have proposed , but we have not yet investigated this .",
    "let @xmath271 be the current walk or polygon ( or `` state '' ) of length @xmath272 edges .",
    "choose an edge @xmath273 from @xmath271 with uniform probability .",
    "enumerate the possible elementary moves on @xmath273 ; in the bcc lattice there are @xmath67 possible moves while in the fcc there are @xmath38 possible moves . at most one these elementary moves is a negative atmospheric move ( will shorten the polygon or walk ) , while the remaining moves are positive or neutral .",
    "choose one of the possible moves so that a particular positive move is done with probability @xmath241 , a particular negative move is carried out with probability @xmath243 and a particular neutral elementary move is performed with probability @xmath242 .",
    "this produces a state @xmath274 .",
    "if this state is self - avoiding then we accept it and set @xmath275 and otherwise we reject it and set @xmath276 .",
    "it remains to specify the probabilities @xmath241 , @xmath243 and @xmath242 , and hence a probability is attached to each of these moves .",
    "this must be done differently on each lattice .",
    "consider a polygon or walk in the bcc lattice and a given edge @xmath273 .",
    "the possible moves we can perform on @xmath273 depend on the conformation of the of @xmath273 and its predecessor and successor edges . in particular , the moves on a given edge are in one the following classes :    * all the possible moves on the edge @xmath273 are positive elementary moves increasing the length of the walk or polygon ; this gives @xmath67 positive elementary moves on @xmath273 .",
    "* the possible elementary moves include @xmath277 positive and @xmath278 neutral move ; denote this as @xmath279 . *",

    "in addition , one has the boltzmann type relation @xmath288 relating the probability of making a positive elementary move , to that of making a negative elementary move . the cases above sets up a set of bounds on the different probabilities : @xmath289 we need to maximise the value of @xmath241 while satisfying these bounds .",
    "since @xmath290 and @xmath291 , it follows that @xmath292 . if we additionally assume that @xmath293 , then the first six inequalities are redundant and one can simply study the last two ( that is , the bottom row ) .",
    "maximising then gives @xmath294 note that @xmath295 .",
    "the situation is simpler on the fcc lattice due to the simplicity of the elementary move .",
    "when an edge @xmath273 is selected from the polygon there are only two possibilities :    * the four possible moves on the edge @xmath273 are positive elementary moves * three of the possible elementary moves are positive and one is a negative elementary move .",
    "this gives the following set of inequalities for the probabilities @xmath241 , and @xmath243 : @xmath296 since there are no neutral moves in the fcc algorithm we do not require @xmath242 ( or we can simply set @xmath297 ) .",
    "again we have a boltzmann factor relating the probabilities , namely @xmath298 with @xmath290 .",
    "since @xmath292 the first of these equations is redundant , and the second gives @xmath299    with the above choices of @xmath300 on either the bcc or fcc lattices , the algorithm for polygons runs as described below .",
