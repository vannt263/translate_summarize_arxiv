    "this letter focuses on the results of the first three - dimensional ( 3-d ) study of the ballistic interaction of a moderately supersonic dense cloud with a warmer _ magnetized _ tenuous medium .",
    "magnetic fields are ubiquitous in astrophysical environments and can not be neglected in any realistic ism related study .",
    "mac low ( 1994 ) and jones ( 1996 ) have studied the two - dimensional ( 2-d ) magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) of cosmic bullets , extending earlier gasdynamical simulations and addressing the importance of magnetic field in preventing the cloud disruption due to fluid instabilities . in particular jones ( 1996 ) found that a region of strong magnetic pressure ( or magnetic bumper ) develops at the nose of the cloud during its motion through a magnetized medium , whenever its velocity is perpendicular to the initial unperturbed background field ( transverse case ) .",
    "this enhancement was attributed to a strong stretching of the magnetic field lines .",
    "miniati ( 1999b ) further investigated the problem pointing out that the behavior observed in the transverse case was typical , except in the case of a very small angle ( @xmath0 ) between the cloud velocity and the initial magnetic field .",
    "in addition , the development of this magnetic shield in front of the cloud was recognized to play a crucial role in the outcome of cloud collisions ( miniati 1999a ) , because it dramatically reduced the degree of cloud disruption .",
    "further , it was important in terms of exchange of magnetic and kinetic energy between different phases in the ism ( miniati 1999b ) and to highlight cosmic ray electrons ( jones 1994 ) .    while supersonic motion of an individual cloud is obviously idealized ,",
    "there are numerous astronomical contexts which can be illuminated by its example .",
    "for example , mhd wind - cloud interaction may be important for the evolution of synchrotron emission processes from planetary nebulae ( dgani & soker 1998 ) . recently a multi - phase structure has been proposed for the dynamical state of the cosmic intra cluster medium ( fabian 1997 ) , in order to explain euv radiation in excess to what expected from the hot gas there ( bowyer , lieu & mittaz 1998 ) .",
    "although the issue has not been settled yet , this suggestion reinforces the necessity to understand the proper evolution of clouds in a multi - phase medium .",
    "all the previous mhd cloud - motion results were based on 2-d numerical simulations , so the importance of following them up with more realistic 3-d calculations is clear .",
    "stone and collaborators ( stone & norman 1992 ; xu & stone 1995 ) have reported 3-d hydrodynamical simulations of shocked gas clouds .",
    "they found qualitative agreement with analogous 2-d gasdynamical simulations .",
    "however , as we shall see , introduction of nonisotropic maxwell stresses produces very significant effects that differ in 3-d from what has been seen in previous , 2-d mhd simulations .",
    "the numerical computation is based on a total variation diminishing ( tvd ) scheme for ideal mhd ( ryu & jones 1995 ; ryu , jones & frank 1995 ; ryu 1998 ) .",
    "the cloud , initially spherical , is set in motion with respect to the uniform ambient medium with a velocity aligned along the @xmath1-axis .",
    "its velocity is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the sound speed in the ambient medium and the mach number is @xmath4 .",
    "the initial cloud density is @xmath5 , with @xmath6 the intercloud density and @xmath7 .",
    "the direction of the magnetic field is chosen along the @xmath8-axis .",
    "its intensity is conveniently expressed in terms of the familiar parameter @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the hydrodynamic pressure and @xmath11 is the magnetic pressure . in these numerical simulations",
    "we have considered both the cases of a strong field ( @xmath12 ) and a weak field ( @xmath13 ) . to be able to compare with pure hydrodynamic effects ,",
    "a case with @xmath14 ( no magnetic field ) has also been computed .",
    "the calculations have been performed using a @xmath15 zone box containing one quarter of the physical space with radial symmetry applied in the @xmath8-@xmath16 plane around the @xmath1 axis .",
    "the initial cloud radius spanned 26 zones .",
    "additional details on the numerical setup can be found in a companion paper describing quantitative results ( gregori 1999 ) .",
    "since the cloud motion is supersonic , its motion leads to the formation of a forward , bow shock and a reverse , crushing shock propagating through the cloud .",
    "the approximate time for the latter to cross the cloud is referred to as the `` crushing time '' ( jones 1994 ) : @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the initial cloud radius .",
    "as we will see , the crushing time is a relevant dynamical quantity since it is proportional to the time over which disruptive instabilities develop .",
    "as the cloud moves through the ism , its surface is subjected to several instability mechanisms : namely , kelvin - helmholtz ( k - h ) , rayleigh - taylor ( r - t ) and , at start - up , the richtmyer - meshkov ( r - m ) instability .",
    "these instabilities , but especially the r - t instability , will ultimately disrupt the entire cloud . grid - scale noise provides the seed for initial development of such instabilities ( kane 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "at the same time , finite numerical resolution may suppress the large wavenumber ( small scale ) mode components that have the fastest initial growth rate ( chandrasekhar 1961 ) .",
    "the k - h instability is related with the shearing motion at the separation between two fluids .",
    "typically , we should expect such an instability to develop on the lateral boundaries of the cloud .",
    "from our simulations we can see that its effects are generally limited , especially considering that , in the mhd case , the development of the instability tends to be suppressed by the magnetic field for wave vectors in the @xmath1-@xmath8 plane ( chandrasekhar 1961 ; jones 1996 ) .",
    "the most disruptive instability for a supersonic cloud is the r - t .",
    "it develops at the interface between two fluids when the lighter accelerates the heavier one . in the limiting case of an impulsive acceleration , as at the beginning of our simulations where the clouds are set into instantaneous motion",
    ", the r - m instability applies .",
    "however , the linear growth of the r - m instability and the presence of a thin boundary layer on the initial cloud makes the r - m instability relatively unimportant . before a time @xmath19",
    "the cloud interface remains r - t stable , since there is no ongoing acceleration of the cloud body to drive this instability .",
    "when the crushing shock exits the cloud , however , a pressure gradient between the front and the rear is established .",
    "the cloud body is then decelerated , and this induces the r - t growth at its front interface ( mac low 1994 ; jones 1994 ; kane 1999 ) .    in the general hydrodynamic case",
    "a r - t perturbation of wavenumber @xmath20 grows with a characteristic time @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the cloud deceleration ( chandrasekhar 1961 ) . following klein ( 1994 ) , we can estimate the deceleration as @xmath23 with the cloud velocity @xmath24 and the intercloud medium assumed at rest .",
    "it is easy to show that the most destructive modes , those with the largest wavelength , @xmath25 , develop on a timescale @xmath26 .",
    "thus , in the absence of magnetic field influences , the cloud will be disrupted only on a time scale of several @xmath27 ( jones 1996 ; xu & stone 1995 ) .",
    "it is usually pointed out in the literature that in the interaction of a cloud - like object with a magnetized wind , the stretching of magnetic field lines draping around the body of the cloud is limited by their ability to escape by slipping around it ( mac low 1994 ; dgani & soker 1998 ) . on the contrary ,",
    "our results show that the magnetic field influences the development of the cloud deformations produced by instabilities so that the field lines become trapped in such deformations .",
    "this trapping of the field lines is indeed the most important physical process that has been revealed from our 3-d simulations .",
    "its main consequence is then the development of a region of strong magnetic pressure at the leading edge of the cloud .",
    "this is clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ f_lines ] , which shows that even at simulation end most of the `` overrun '' field lines are indeed kept within the r - t fingers without slipping away .",
    "this behavior is different from what is seen at the earth s magnetopause or as predicted for the magnetopause of comets ( yi 1996 ) .",
    "there , field lines do seem to slip past the object , so that it behaves somewhat like a rigid body .",
    "indeed , for both of those cases the impacted body is stiff , because compression produces an increasingly greater restoring force .    in fig .",
    "[ den_hb ] we compare the cloud evolution for the three studied cases of the field intensity through 3-d volume rendering images of gas density .",
    "the four pictures in the ( first , second , third ) columns correspond to different evolutionary times for the progression of cases : @xmath28 respectively .",
    "the most significant conclusion is that the presence of a strong background magnetic field ( @xmath12 ) dramatically modifies the dynamical evolution of the cloud . for the hydrodynamic simulation",
    "the cloud is initially uniformly crushed in the direction aligned with its motion and the disruptive instabilities , which are radially symmetric because of the imposed symmetry , become evident only by the end of the simulation ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "our resolution is not sufficient to allow really fine k - h instabilities to develop on the cloud perimeter such as those evident in the hydrodynamical shocked - cloud results of xu & stone ( 1995 ) , but the global evolutions in our hydrodynamic simulations are comparable . by contrast with this behavior , the presence of a strong field ( @xmath12 case ) causes the cloud to be additionally compressed along the @xmath8-axis by the draping magnetic field lines . as a result",
    "the cloud is `` extruded '' in a direction orthogonal to the plane containing its motion and the initial field .",
    "this behavior is already well visible after one crushing time .    as noted earlier",
    ", magnetic fields inhibit the r - t instabilities in the @xmath1-@xmath8 plane ( jones 1996 ) .",
    "the development of this instability only along the @xmath16-axis , then produces the c - shaped structure of the cloud ( last panel in fig .",
    "[ den_hb ] ) , as opposed to the symmetrical `` sombrero '' surface of the hydrodynamical case .",
    "in addition , the presence of the magnetic field enhances the growth of the r - t instability . in the strong field case ( @xmath12 ) , this can be assessed by replacing the ram pressure @xmath30 with an effective pressure @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ decel ] ) .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that , for small @xmath32 , @xmath33 becomes comparable to or larger than the ram pressure @xmath30 during times @xmath34 ( see also miniati 1999b ) .",
    "taking into account this additional magnetic term then shortens the time scale for the development of the instability by a factor @xmath35 .",
    "the instability enters the nonlinear stage sooner and its exponential growth determines the dramatic differences from the hydrodynamical case as shown in fig .",
    "[ den_hb ] . in this sense ,",
    "our results describe the cloud disruption by a _",
    "magnetically enhanced r - t like instability_.    a weak field ( @xmath13 ) changes the cloud dynamics in a similar way , but more slowly and less dramatically . with a limited growth of a c - shaped structures , the development of the r - t instability in front of the cloud looks typical , although it still shows evidence of the asymmetric maxwell stresses . also at @xmath36",
    "the magnetic pressure is still a small fraction of the ram pressure in front of the cloud .",
    "therefore , although the shape of the cloud undergoes some deformation compared to the hydrodynamical case , the growth rate of the instability has not been enhanced significantly .",
    "further discussions on the magnetic energy evolution and its effect on the cloud morphology are given by gregori ( 1999 ) .",
    "in this paper we have presented the first results of a series of 3-d mhd numerical simulations of cloud motion in a multi - phase interstellar medium .",
    "we have considered a spherical cloud that moves transverse to the magnetic field , with two different cases for its initial strength ; namely @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "both the weak ( @xmath38 ) and strong field ( @xmath37 ) simulations showed a comparable behavior with a substantial enhancement of the magnetic pressure at the leading edge of the cloud as a result of field line stretching there .",
    "this confirms and extends previous 2-d results ( jones 1996 ; miniati 1999b ) .",
    "the importance of field line stretching to field amplification and cloud motion can now be fully appreciated , since the slipping of the field lines around the cloud ( which was prevented in 2-d simulations by their geometry ) turned out to be a minor effect in our 3-d simulations . in general moving clouds",
    "are reshaped by the field lines draping around their bodies , generating elongated structures oriented perpendicular to both the background magnetic field and the flow velocity .",
    "this is also important in terms of cloud collisions because it means that if two clouds are approaching each other moving through the same large scale magnetic field , their elongated , cylindrical bodies will tend to collide with the longer axis aligned . this helps validate previous 2-d mhd cloud collision calculations ( miniati 1999a ) and sets important constraints for future work on that subject .",
    "_ the main result of this study is that contrary to 2-d geometry where fluid instabilities were prevented by the growth of a strong magnetic field , in 3-d they are instead considerably hastened by it .",
    "_ this was clearly shown in fig .",
    "[ den_hb ] where the dramatic difference between the purely hydrodynamic and the @xmath12 mhd case is attributed to the accelerated development of a r - t instability in the latter .",
    "it was also shown that for @xmath39 the timescale for the cloud disruption is reduced by a factor @xmath35 .",
