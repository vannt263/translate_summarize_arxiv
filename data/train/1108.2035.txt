    "we provide a specific design which admits a strong coupling of a nanomechanical resonator to an lc circuit and simultaneously admits optical coupling ( fig .",
    "[ f : setup ] ) .",
    "specifically we envision a parallel plate capacitor where we replace one of the plates by a set of wires of thickness @xmath22 , width @xmath23 , and separated by a distance @xmath24 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : capacitor](a ) . in order to have an interaction with light we introduce a hole in the capacitor to allow for laser beams to get through ( not shown ) .",
    "this hole has a minimal effect on the capacitance when the membrane area is much larger than the mode cross section of the cavity , consistent with a ( 1 mm)@xmath33 membrane and a 50 @xmath34 m cavity waist .",
    "a dielectric membrane of thickness @xmath25 is inserted into the capacitor a distance @xmath8 from the top of the wires .",
    "the replacement of one of the capacitor plates by the set of wires creates a spatial inhomogeniety of the electric field , which attracts the membrane towards the wires when the capacitor is charged . at the same time",
    "this inhomogeniety also means that the capacitance @xmath35 will depend on the position of the membrane @xmath36 . expanding the capacitance around the equilibrium position",
    "gives rise to an lc - membrane coupling @xmath37 .",
    "this is analogous to the radiation pressure coupling that occurs in the optical domain , i.e. , a @xmath38 type nonlinearity . as such",
    ", we can enhance the coupling strength by providing a classical displacement of the lc circuit s charge , with either a dc or ac voltage bias @xmath39 providing an offset charge , @xmath40 . for simplicity",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case of a dc voltage , though generalization to the ac case is a simple extension of these ideas and allows to frequency match the lc and mechanical systems .",
    "the coupling between the membrane position and the charge fluctuations around the equilibrium @xmath41 is then @xmath42 and is enhanced by the large charge @xmath43 induced on the capacitor , in direct analogy to the similar effect for cavity optomechanics .",
    "the full hamiltonian including electrical and mechanical contributions is : @xmath44 here @xmath45 is the equilibrium membrane position at @xmath46 .",
    "the fixed point of the classical charge @xmath43 at a given bias voltage and the equilibrium displacement @xmath47 are then found from @xmath48 which yields @xmath49 here we have introduced a characteristic length scale @xmath50 defined by @xmath51 , which describes the relative change in the capacitance at the new equilibrium position @xmath47 .    around these classical values , we consider the remaining quantum fluctuations @xmath52 .",
    "we change to annihilation and creation operators @xmath53 for the membrane ( lc ) , and find a hamiltonian @xmath54 with @xmath55 .",
    "this corresponds to the model hamiltonian examined in the beginning . assuming a constant value of @xmath56 from @xmath45 to @xmath47 , the coupling constant can be expressed in a more intuitive form @xmath57 , i.e. , through the capacitance change @xmath58 caused by the displacement of the membrane due to the applied voltage @xmath39 .",
    "the solution is a stable point under the condition @xmath59 .",
    "we have neglected a small nonlinear correction , due to the femtometer length scale of the zero - point membrane fluctuations .",
    "devices which enhance this nonlinear coupling are of interest , but beyond the scope of the present work .    to obtain quantitative estimates of the feasible coupling constant , we assume the plate electrode to be much larger than the separation of the plate and transverse dimensions of the wires @xmath60 .",
    "we can then find the capacitance for a given position of the membrane by solving for the potential using the finite element method .",
    "we express the capacitance as @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is a dimensionless number of order unity , which describe the deviation from a standard parallel plate capacitor .    as an example , we take a sin membrane of dielectric constant @xmath30 and thickness @xmath63 nm inserted into a capacitor with a separation @xmath64 @xmath34 m and dimensions @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 . a simulation with these values",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : capacitor ] ( b ) . from this simulation",
    "we extract the values of @xmath65 @xmath34 m for a distance of @xmath66 @xmath34 m . hence if the applied voltage shifts the equilibrium position by @xmath67 nm around @xmath66 @xmath34 m the coupling constant is @xmath68 and the system is in the strong coupling regime if the q values of the lc circuit and membrane exceed 100 . assuming an operating frequency of @xmath69 mhz and an oscillator length @xmath70",
    "fm this displacement only requires an applied voltage on the order of a few volts .",
    "if a larger initial separation is desirable , a similar coupling ( @xmath71 ) could be achieved if the equilibrium distance is shifted from @xmath72 @xmath34 m to @xmath73 @xmath34 m ( @xmath74 @xmath34 m for @xmath73 @xmath34 m ) with an applied voltage of several hundred volts .",
    "the membrane may be efficiently cooled via optomechanical coupling between the radiation pressure force of a cavity field and the position of the central area of the membrane .",
    "the details of this process have been analyzed by a wide variety of groups  @xcite .",
    "in essence the effect on the membrane degree of freedom @xmath75 is to induce a damping @xmath76 , which is much greater than the intrinsic damping rate of the membrane @xmath77 , but is limited by the cavity decay rate @xmath78 .",
    "this additional damping only produces moderate additional quantum fluctuations associated with the vacuum noise of the light field ( which can be accounted for by adjusting the temperature of @xmath79 defined below ) . working with the lc circuit with damping @xmath80 , resonant with the membrane ( @xmath81 )",
    ", we may expect an efficient coupling between the optomechanical system and the lc circuit , provided that @xmath82 such that we can get excitations out of the system faster than they leak in .",
    "we use the input - output formalism in the rotating wave approximation to find a full description of this combined mode cooling .",
    "the heisenberg - langevin equations describing this situation are @xmath83    in a strong damping limit ( @xmath84 ) , we can treat the coupled lc resonator as a perturbation and arrive at @xmath85 this equation describes the cooling of @xmath86 through the membrane - light system with a rate @xmath87 . in the continuous cooling limit , we expect to achieve a thermal population in @xmath86 given by @xmath88 where @xmath89 are the original thermal occupation of modes @xmath75 and @xmath86 . typically this population will be dominated by the heating of the lc circuit ( the first term ) since the membrane can have a very large @xmath90  @xcite .    in the mode - resolved , strong - coupling limit , with @xmath91 and @xmath92 , each of the two normal modes @xmath93 and @xmath94 have frequencies @xmath95 and a damping rate given given by the average of the two damping rates @xmath96 .",
    "the optomechanical coupling then works independently on each of the two modes .",
    "assuming again the @xmath97 of the membrane to be much higher than the @xmath97 of the lc , a standard argument for optomechanical cooling  @xcite leads to a thermal occupation number of @xmath98 .    comparing the two limits derived above we see that the minimal thermal occupation is achieved at a cooling laser power and detuning such that @xmath99 , where we obtain a population @xmath100 .",
    "the cooling of the membrane is , however , limited by the cavity decay rate @xmath78 .",
    "hence the cooling limit is the larger of @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "we have neglected optical heating effects , consistent with our assumption of good sideband - resolution ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "the cooling identified above realizes an interface between optical fields and rf excitations of the lc circuits at the single photon level , and we now turn to a possible application of this interface .",
    "often lc circuits are used in sensitive detectors to pick up very small signals  @xcite . as we will now show",
    ", the sensitivity in such experiments can be improved by detecting the cooling light leaving the cavity .",
    "this takes advantage of the fact that the homodyne detection of laser light can be quantum noise limited with near - unit quantum efficiency , thus avoiding many of the noise sources present for low frequency signals . to show this we will work in the strong damping limit identified above @xmath103 with the lc circuit tuned into resonance with the membrane ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "again we also assume the damping of the mechanical motion of the membrane to be negligible @xmath105 . in this limit",
    "the membrane and the cavity mediate an effective interaction between the lc mode @xmath86 and the optical cavity input / output modes @xmath106 with the effective cooling rate @xmath107 introduced above . in the rotating wave approximation",
    "this situation is described by the generic equations @xmath108 here , we have introduced an incoming signal to be measured , which is described by @xmath109 . if the signal is from a voltage @xmath39 applied to the system , @xmath110 .",
    "suppose that we want to measure the fourier components of the incoming signals @xmath111 detuned by a frequency @xmath112 with respect to the resonance frequency of the lc circuit @xmath113 within a certain bandwidth @xmath114 .",
    "this can be done by splitting the outgoing signal on a beamsplitter ( @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the annihilation operator for the other mode incident on the beamsplitter ) and inferring the two quadratures @xmath117 and @xmath118 from a homodyne detection of the @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) quadrature of the @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) mode .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio for , e.g. , a measurement of the amplitude can be defined by @xmath123 . here",
    "@xmath124 describes the noise @xmath125 in the absence of any signal . from the equations of motion we find @xmath126}(2n_d+1)}}\\ ] ] here @xmath127 describes the number of thermal excitations in the field used to probe the circuit and we assume that the fields incident on the beamsplitter are of the same type such that @xmath128 .",
    "let us compare our approach to the case where the lc circuit is read out by homodyne detection with an rf amplifier assumed to have a similar number of thermal excitations as the system being measured @xmath129 . disregarding any additional noise added during the amplification , @xmath130 is optimized for @xmath131 and is limited to @xmath132 with a detection bandwidth @xmath133 .",
    "in contrast , with the optical readout , the incoming laser fields can be quantum noise limited with @xmath134 if light is in a coherent state . in this case",
    "we obtain twice the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath130 for @xmath135 .",
    "the optimal sensitivity is thus better with optical detection , even if we assume ideal detection of the fields in both cases .",
    "such an ideal detection is routinely achieved by homodyne detection of optical fields with near unity quantum efficiency , whereas it is hard to achieve for rf fields . for realistic limited detect or efficiencies of rf fields ,",
    "the sensitivity may thus be significantly improved using optical readout .",
    "furthermore the high sensitivity with laser cooling is obtained over a much larger bandwidth which is determined by @xmath136 . in other words ,",
    "if , prior to laser cooling , the lc circuit had a high - q and a narrow bandwidth @xmath80 that is less than the bandwidth @xmath137 required for a particular application , laser cooling allows an increase of the bandwidth with a limited decrease in the sensitivity ( @xmath138 db ) if @xmath139 . using regular rf techniques",
    ", an alternative approach would be to increase the bandwidth by increasing the damping of the circuit , but this would result in a decrease of the sensitivity by a factor of @xmath140 . crucially , since optical fields are shot - noise limited even at room temperature , this measurement setup does not involve cryogenics .",
    "the potential benefits of this approach  high quantum efficiency conversion from radio frequency to optical photons , and the corresponding potential for low temperature detection of radio frequency signals  are limited by the finite q values for room temperature inductors .",
    "appropriate replacements may be considered , such as crystal resonators or cryogenic superconducting resonators .",
    "an additional benefit of a cryogenic setup is the possibility to enter the quantum strong coupling limit , @xmath141 , at which point the conversion from radio frequency to optical domain can be used as a quantum interface .",
    "however , understanding of these features and improvements requires further investigation .",
