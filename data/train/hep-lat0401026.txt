    "so far most investigations of the static potential , and the dynamics that drives it , have concentrated on the quark - antiquark ( @xmath1 ) system , while little is known about the forces of the three - quark ( @xmath2 ) ensemble . for understanding the structure of baryons and , in particular , for modelling the nucleon  @xcite , it is important to learn about the forces and the distribution of color electric flux in the @xmath2 system as well .",
    "a particularly interesting question is whether a genuine three - body force exists and the confining flux tube is of y  shape , or whether the long - range potential is simply the sum of two - body potentials , in agreement with a @xmath3ansatz , resulting in a flux tube of @xmath3shape . by a flux tube of y and @xmath3shape",
    "we understand a flux tube between the three quarks having shortest possible length and a junction , and a flux tube constructed out of three quark - antiquark flux tubes taken with a factor @xmath4 .",
    "several lattice quenched qcd studies report evidence for a @xmath3type long - range potential  @xcite , while others claim a genuine three - body force  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite various patterns of the three - quark system were considered with the distance between quarks in an equilateral triangle , @xmath5 , up to 0.8 fm .",
    "it was found that at large distances the @xmath6ansatz gives a better description of the three - quark potential than the @xmath3ansatz . on the other hand , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite found that at distances @xmath7 fm the three - quark potential is described quite well by @xmath3ansatz , while it rises like the @xmath6ansatz at larger distances , @xmath8 fm .",
    "the @xmath6ansatz is also being supported by the field correlator method  @xcite .",
    "the difference between a @xmath3 and y  shape potential is rather small and difficult to detect , because the underlying wilson loop decays approximately exponentially with increasing interquark distance .",
    "a computation of the distribution of the color electric flux inside the baryon might help to resolve this problem .    in this paper we shall study the static potential and the flux tube of the @xmath2 system .",
    "the long - distance physics appears to be predominantly abelian  being the result of a yet unresolved mechanism  and driven by monopole condensation .",
    "the use of abelian variables is an essential ingredient in our work , as it leads to a substantial reduction of the statistical noise .",
    "preliminary results of this investigation have been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we describe the details of our simulation , including the correlation functions that we are going to compute .",
    "the results of the calculation are presented in sections 3 and 4 .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the study of the @xmath2 system at zero temperature , while section 4 deals with the finite temperature case . finally , in section 5 we conclude .",
    "we employ the wilson gauge field action throughout this paper . in our studies of full qcd",
    "we are using non - perturbatively @xmath9 improved wilson fermions , @xmath10 with @xmath11 flavors of dynamical quarks , where @xmath12 is the ordinary wilson fermion action .",
    "further details of the dynamical runs are given in  @xcite .",
    "the system of three static quarks propagating from @xmath13 to @xmath14 may be described by the ` baryonic ' wilson loop @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the ordered product of link matrices @xmath17 along the path @xmath18 , as shown in fig.[fig : wil2 ] .",

    "the physical properties of the @xmath2 system can be infered from correlation functions of appropriate operators with the corresponding wilson loop .",
    "abelian operators take the form @xmath28 for c - parity even operators @xmath29 , like the action and monopole densities , the correlator of @xmath30 with the abelian wilson loop is given by  @xcite @xmath31 for c - parity odd operators , like the electric field and monopole current which carry a color index , the correlator is defined by @xmath32 where summation over @xmath33 is assumed .",
    "it is natural to use wilson loop to study the static potential at zero temperature since it gives directly a singlet potential .",
    "the polyakov loop correlator gives in general a color - averaged potential , i.e. a mixture of the singlet and octet potentials , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "at nonzero temperature one can use only the polyakov loop correlator to study the static potential and we use the product @xmath34 of three polyakov loops closed around the boundary as baryonic source instead of @xmath35 : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the abelian polyakov loop , @xmath20 being the temporal extent of the lattice here .",
    "the correlators of @xmath30 with @xmath34 are defined analogously to ( [ even ] ) and ( [ odd ] ) .",
    "the observables we shall study are the action density @xmath38 , the color electric field @xmath39 and the monopole current @xmath40 .",
    "the action density is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the plaquette angle .",
    "the color electric field and monopole current correlators are defined by @xmath43 and @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the monopole current  @xcite .",
    "the calculations in full qcd at zero temperature are performed on the @xmath46 lattice at @xmath47 , @xmath48 , which corresponds to a pion mass of @xmath49 and a lattice spacing of @xmath50  @xcite ( i.e. @xmath51 fm assuming @xmath52 fm ) .",
    "the calculations in full qcd at finite temperature @xmath53 are done on the @xmath54 lattice at @xmath55 for various hopping parameters ranging from @xmath56 to @xmath57 , which covers the temperature range  @xcite @xmath58 .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath59 corresponds to @xmath60 . at this @xmath61",
    "we find @xmath62 . for comparison",
    ", we also did quenched simulations at zero temperature on the @xmath63 lattice at @xmath64 . at this @xmath65",
    "the lattice spacing is @xmath66 , i.e. it is roughly the same as on our full qcd lattices . to reduce the statistical noise we smeared the spatial links of the abelian wilson loop using 10 sweeps of ape smearing @xcite with @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is a coefficient multiplying the sum of staples",
    "the minimal y - type distance between the quarks , i.e. the sum of the distance from the quarks to the fermat point is @xcite @xmath69 where @xmath70 marks the position of the @xmath71 quark , @xmath72 and @xmath73 is the area of the triangle spanned by the three quarks .",
    "the @xmath6ansatz predicts that the confining part of the baryonic potential is @xmath74 , with string tension @xmath75 equal to the @xmath1 string tension @xcite : @xmath76 the full expression describing both large and small distances is @xmath77 where , similarly to the @xmath1 static potential , @xmath78 is a selfenergy term , the coulomb term with effective coupling @xmath79 comprises one gluon exchange as well as a lscher term , recently derived for the baryonic string in @xcite , and the confining term has string tension @xmath75 .",
    "the @xmath3ansatz prediction @xcite is that the confining part of the potential is proportional to the perimeter of the triangle formed by the quarks @xmath80 with string tension @xmath81 the short distance part is of the same form as in eq.([y - ansatz ] ) .",
    "thus the full expression for the @xmath3ansatz potential is @xmath82 for short distances perturbation theory arguments relate the selfenergy and the coulomb term coefficient to those of the @xmath1 static potential @xcite : @xmath83 on the other hand fitting the numerical data including both long and short distances by ( [ y - ansatz ] ) or by ( [ d - ansatz ] ) one may find results which differ from ( [ 32rule ] ) , e.g. due to the lscher term contribution . in ref.@xcite a rough agreement between the fit parameters and ( [ 32rule ] ) has been found for both @xmath6ansatz and @xmath3ansatz fits .",

    "an unphysical constant @xmath85 has been subtracted from the potentials . for equal distances between the quarks , i.e. @xmath86 for @xmath87 , eq.([y - ansatz ] ) becomes @xmath88 fitting our data for three quarks in equilateral triangles by eq.([y - poten ] ) for distances @xmath89 fm we found the abelian string tension @xmath90 and 0.0395(12 ) for the quenched and full theory , respectively .",
    "these values agree within error bars with the abelian string tension for the @xmath1 flux tube @xmath91 and 0.0402(11 ) @xcite thus supporting the @xmath6ansatz .",
    "note , that both @xmath2 and @xmath1 abelian string tensions are slightly higher in full qcd .",
    "we found values for the selfenergy and the coulomb term coefficient smaller than prescribed by ( [ 32rule ] ) : @xmath92 in full qcd and @xmath93 in quenched qcd .",
    "the fits are also shown in fig.[fig : pot - q - f ] .    in fig.[fig",
    ": potsu3ab ] the abelian and the nonabelian quenched potentials are plotted together with respective fits .",
    "the data for the nonabelian potential is taken from ref .",
    "comparison of @xmath94 with the su(3 ) result  @xcite gives @xmath95 , which lends further support to the hypothesis of abelian dominance .",
    "( top ) and @xmath96 ( bottom ) , respectively .",
    "the curves show fits ( [ y - poten ] ) ( top ) and ( [ d - ansatz ] ) ( bottom ) to the data with equal distances between the static sources.,width=321 ]    if the confining flux is of y - shape we would expect the long - distance part of the potential to be a universal function of @xmath97 . in fig.[fig:3qamp3 ]",
    "we plot the abelian potential as a function of @xmath97 ( top ) , and as a function of @xmath98 ( bottom ) .",
    "the data show a universal behavior when plotted against @xmath97 .",
    "this is to a lesser extent the case when plotted against @xmath98 , which supports a genuine three - body force of y - type . in fig.[fig:3qamp3 ] the fits by the @xmath99ansatz and by the @xmath3ansatz for the quarks in the equilateral triangle are shown in the top and bottom parts , respectively .",
    "note that for the quarks in the equilateral triangle these two fits are essentially the same with @xmath100 and equal selfenergy and coulomb coefficient .    in fig.[fig",
    ": comparison.poten ] and fig.[fig : comparison.poten2 ] we show further comparison of our data with @xmath3 and @xmath6anstze for full and quenched qcd . the data for the three - quark potential are plotted as a function of distance @xmath5 for equilateral triangle . in the same figures the curves showing respective @xmath6ansatz and @xmath3ansatz predictions are plotted .",
    "we fix all parameters in the anstze using relations ( [ y - tension ] ) , ( [ d - tension ] ) and ( [ 32rule ] ) .",
    "we see that for both full and quenched qcd at distances @xmath101 fm the three quark potential data agree with the @xmath3ansatz , while at larger distances it agrees with @xmath6ansatz up to an additive constant indicating that the string tension @xmath102 is equal to @xmath103 as was already discussed above .",
    "similar findings were presented for the quenched nonabelian potential in @xcite .",
    "thus we conclude that our data for the abelian potential confirm the @xmath6ansatz for large distances .",
    "the agreement with the @xmath3ansatz at short distances , which was also observed in @xcite , is probably a coincidence since the @xmath3ansatz prediction eq.([d - tension ] ) is formulated for large quark separations . on the other hand , the proximity of the potential to the @xmath3ansatz at distances which are relevant for the spectrum calculations might be important for the phenomenologists since the calculations with the @xmath3ansatz potential are much simpler .",
    "the disagreement with the y - anzatz at small distances was first clearly observed in ref.@xcite .",
    "one can guess that the finite size of the junction play the role in appearance of this discrepancy .",
    "although our data for the static potential at small distances behave similar to that of ref.@xcite we are not in a position to make strong statements about the short distances since we are using the abelian projection which , as many earlier observations suggest , gives correct description of the static potentials at large distances only .",
    "although the results for the static potential are in favor of the @xmath6ansatz , the difference from the @xmath3ansatz prediction is rather small .",
    "thus it is worthwhile to study the color flux distribution . in fig.[fig :",
    "ergb ] we show the distribution of the color electric field @xmath104 , and its surrounding monopole currents @xmath40 , on the @xmath105 lattice in full qcd . the time direction of the wilson loop has been taken in one of the spatial directions of the lattice .",
    "points on the hyperplane orthogonal to the time direction of the wilson loop are marked by @xmath106 .",
    "the static quarks are placed at @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , respectively , i.e. they lie in the @xmath110 plane .",
    "the color index of the electric field operator ( cf .",
    "( [ electric ] ) ) is identified with the color index of the quark in the bottom - right corner ( in the center bottom figure ) .",
    "note that the sum of the electric field over the three color indices vanishes at any point .",
    "as expected , the flux emanates from the quark in the bottom - right corner and at about the center of the @xmath2 system splits into two parts .",
    "the flux lines are schematically drawn in fig.[fig : ele ] .",
    "a similar picture holds for the top and bottom - left quark and their respective fluxes . in the adjacent figures we show the monopole current in the planes perpendicular to the electric flux lines , i.e. the @xmath111 and @xmath112 planes .",
    "they form a solenoidal current , as in the case of the @xmath1 system , in agreement with the dual superconductor picture of confinement",
    ".    we may decompose the abelian gauge field into a monopole and photon part according to the definition  @xcite @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the lattice coulomb propagator , @xmath115 is the lattice backward derivative , and @xmath116 counts the number of dirac strings piercing the plaquette @xmath117 .",
    "if one computes @xmath45 from @xmath118 one recovers almost all monopole currents . in fig.[fig:3qamp3 ] we see that the monopole part is largely responsible for the linear behavior of the potential , as was found already in case of the @xmath1 potential  @xcite .",
    "the ratio of monopole to abelian string tension turns out to be 0.81(3 ) .    in fig.[fig :",
    "epma ] we show the distribution of the abelian color electric field photon parts .",
    "the photon part shows a coulomb - like distribution , while the monopole part has no sources . outside the flux tube",
    "the monopole and photon parts of the color electric field largely cancel .",
    "the middle figure shows clearly that the flux lines are attracted to a y - type geometry .    in fig.[fig :",
    "pma455action ] we show the action density @xmath38 of the @xmath2 system in full qcd . also shown is the monopole and photon part of @xmath38 separately .",
    "let us first look at the ( full ) abelian density .",
    "it clearly displays a y - type geometry of the color forces .",
    "this is , of course , indistinguishable from a geometry of purely two - body forces with strongly attracting flux lines .",
    "the monopole part of the action density shows no sources .",
    "apart from that , it appears that the action density originates almost entirely from the monopole part .",
    "the sources show up in the photon part of the action density as expected .",
    "we have done similar calculations ( to the ones shown in figs.[fig:3qamp3 ] , [ fig : ergb ] , [ fig : epma ] , [ fig : pma455action ] ) in quenched qcd as well .",
    "part of our findings have been reported in  @xcite , and we refrain from repeating them here .",
    "qualitatively , we found the same results as in full qcd at @xmath49 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : action.section ] we compare the action density of full and quenched qcd .",
    "we see that at the center of the flux tube the action density in full qcd is slightly higher than for the quenched case , while the shapes are rather similar .",
    "the same feature has been observed for the @xmath1 flux tube @xcite .",
    "we have estimated the width @xmath119 of the flux tube using a gaussian fit @xcite .",
    "the result is @xmath120 fm and @xmath121 fm in full and quenched qcd , respectively .",
    "this is to be compared with the width of the @xmath1 flux tube , which turned out to be 0.29(1 ) fm in full and quenched qcd @xcite .",
    "we found that the width increases closer to the junction .",
    "so the numbers quoted above are only to tell that the width of the baryon flux tube , away from the junction is not very different from that of the @xmath1 flux tube . for a more precise determination of the width larger quark separation",
    "is necessary .",
    "it is interesting to compare the action density shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pma455action ] with the action density constructed out of three @xmath1 flux tube action densities multiplied , in agreement with ( [ d - tension ] ) , by a factor @xmath4 to take into account that we are dealing with pairs of quarks rather than with @xmath1 pairs .",
    "such a comparison has been done in ref.@xcite for the potts model .",
    "for the @xmath1 action density we used the results of ref.@xcite .",
    "the resulting density is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : action.sum - q - aq ] .",
    "figures [ fig : pma455action ] and [ fig : action.sum - q - aq ] look rather different .",
    "the most important difference is that the measured density has a bump in the center , while the @xmath3ansatz density has a dip .",
    "this comparison gives further support to the @xmath6ansatz .",
    "we expect the flux tube to disappear and the color electric field to become coulomb- or yukawa - like above the finite temperature phase transition @xmath59 and when the string breaks in full qcd .",
    "this phenomenon has been observed in case of the @xmath1 system in the pure su(2 ) gauge theory for temperatures @xmath122  @xcite and in full qcd for @xmath53 just below and above @xmath59  @xcite . throughout this section",
    "we shall use the polyakov loop ( [ p3q ] ) to create a baryon .    in fig.[fig:3qpotft ]",
    "we show the baryon potential on the @xmath54 lattice at @xmath55 for several values of @xmath61 . at this @xmath65 value",
    "@xmath123 increasing @xmath61 thus increases the temperature .",
    "we cross the finite temperature phase transition at @xmath124  @xcite .",
    "we see that the potential flattens off while we approach the transition point . however , the distances we were able to probe are not large enough to make any statement about string breaking .",
    "( @xmath125 ) and @xmath98 ( @xmath126 ) , respectively.,width=355 ]    to compute the action density @xmath38 and the electric field and monopole correlators @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively , we need to reduce the statistical noise .",
    "we do that by averaging over time slices and using extended operators @xmath127 @xmath128 @xmath129 where ( again ) we have assumed that the quarks lie in the @xmath110 plane , and we consider the monopole current in the @xmath130 plane . in fig.[fig : ftaction ] we plot the abelian action density in the deconfined phase at @xmath57 .",
    "as was to be expected , the action density shows three coulomb - like peaks at the position of the quarks , similar to the photon part of the action density at zero temperature as shown in fig.[fig : pma455action ] .",
    "= 9.5 cm = 14.5 cm    in fig.[fig : r04mon ] we show the monopole part of the electric field , averaged over the color components , and the accompanying monopole current for three values of @xmath61 , corresponding ( from left to right ) to the confined case , to @xmath131 and to the deconfined phase . in the confinement phase ( @xmath132 )",
    "we find the flux to be of y - shape , similar to the zero temperature case where we used wilson loop correlators .",
    "note that the polyakov lines do not have a y - shape junction like the wilson loop does , which excludes the possibility that the flux is being induced by the color lines .",
    "just below @xmath59 ( @xmath133 ) we still see a y - shape flux , while in the deconfined phase ( @xmath57 ) the electric field becomes coulomb - like .",
    "we have studied the @xmath2 system in the maximally abelian gauge in full qcd at zero and at finite temperature . among the quantities we have looked at are the abelian baryon potential as well as the flux distribution and the action density . while on the basis of the potential it is hard to decide whether the long - range potential is of @xmath3- or y - type , the distribution of the color electric field and the action density clearly shows a y - shape geometry . as in the @xmath1 system , we identified the solenoidal monopole current to be responsible for squeezing the color electric flux into a narrow tube .",
    "little difference to the quenched theory was found . in the deconfined phase the flux tube disappears , and the color electric field assumes a coulomb - like form .",
