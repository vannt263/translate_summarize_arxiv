    "recently , the miniboone collaboration reported its results of searching for @xmath7 oscillations @xcite . in the experiment , the @xmath8 energy spectrum has a peak centered at 700 mev and extends to 3000 mev . for the oscillation range @xmath9 mev where @xmath10 is the energy of the produced neutrino , no significant excess of events is found .",
    "this result excludes sizable appearance of @xmath11 via two neutrino oscillation and disfavors the previous lsnd measurement @xcite .",
    "however , they observed that outside of the oscillation range , there is a clear peak of the electron - neutrino - like events ( @xmath12 events ) lying above background at @xmath13 mev .",
    "although the origin of the excess is still under investigation , we may assume that they are indeed electron neutrinos at present .",
    "the beam is completely composed of @xmath14 and the oscillation can only produce @xmath11 with the same energy , therefore the observation would be a serious challenge to the present theories .",
    "namely a reasonable explanation about the appearance of the low energy @xmath11 is needed . to answer this question ,",
    "there are some interesting proposals , for example , in @xcite the authors suggest a ( 3 + 2 ) neutrino oscillation scenario where two sterile neutrinos are introduced into the game to explain the miniboone results and bodek@xcite considered the internal bremsstrahlung as an alternative source of the excess @xmath11 events . instead , in this work",
    ", we are looking for possible mechanisms other than the neutrino oscillation , supposing that there are only standard model ( sm ) neutrinos . an explanation that @xmath14 may decay into @xmath15 where @xmath4 denotes some possible light products , seems reasonable .",
    "definitely , neutrino decay must be realized via interactions beyond the sm .",
    "the possible candidates of @xmath4 could be @xmath16 , light bosons ( for example axion etc . ) and the unparticle which we are going to explore in this work .",
    "in fact , the idea of neutrino decay is not new .",
    "it has been put forward by some authors @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to introduce a heavy , unstable neutrino ( usually assuming a sterile one ) which decays into light neutrino or antineutrino plus a scalar particle .",
    "the interactions between the scalar particle and neutrinos are described by a lepton flavor violating effective lagrangian which depends on the details of various new physics models .",
    "instead , we suggest an alternative scenario , namely the heavier @xmath1 which is a mass eigenstate and a component of the flavor eigenstate @xmath14 , is the constituents of the beam and decays into a light neutrino @xmath2 and a scale - invariant unparticle proposed recently by georgi @xcite .",
    "it is well known that at very high energy scale , the unparticle physics contains the sm fields and a sector of banks - zaks field ( defined in @xcite ) with a non - trivial infrared fix point .",
    "below an energy scale @xmath17 which is of order of tev , the banks - zaks fields are matched onto a scale invariant unparticle sector .",
    "the unparticle is different from the ordinary particles as it has no mass since the mass term breaks the scale invariance , but the lorentz - invariant four - momentum square needs not to be zero , @xmath18 .",
    "the scale dimension of unparticle is in general fractional rather than an integral number ( the dimension for a fermion is half - integers ) .",
    "this special characteristic brings us a natural explanation of the shape of low energy @xmath11 bump observed by the miniboone collaboration .",
    "if @xmath19 decays into a @xmath2 and a real scalar particle where @xmath20 are neutrino mass eigenstates , it is a two - body decay where the energy - spectrum of the produced @xmath11 should be discrete .",
    "it is in contrary to the observation where the energy spectrum of the produced @xmath11 is continuous .",
    "indeed , the incident @xmath14 beam has an energy distribution which can result in a natural energy spreading for the produced electron - neutrino , however , it demands that the shape of @xmath11 spectrum must be similar to that of the incident @xmath14 beam . instead ,",
    "if the produced @xmath4 is an unparticle , the energy spectrum of @xmath11 would naturally spread and it may be more consistent with the present measurements .",
    "the interactions between the unparticle and the sm particles are described in the framework of low energy effective theory and lead to various interesting phenomenology .",
    "there have been many phenomenological explorations on possible observable effects caused by unparticles @xcite and much more are coming up .",
    "the miniboone results indicate that the energy of the events of excess is about a half of the peak position at the energy spectrum of the muon neutrino .",
    "as discussed above , we suggest a decay mode @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the unparticle and a consequent transition @xmath23 might be observed , namely @xmath14 and @xmath11 are not physical eigenstates , but are that of weak interaction and can be caught by detector as an appearance of @xmath11 at lower energy .",
    "as indicated in @xcite , the unparticle stuff with scale dimension @xmath24 can not be `` seen '' directly , it would manifest itself as a missing energy .",
    "when the scale dimension @xmath24 is not very large , the energy spectrum of electron neutrino can fall into the allowed range of the miniboone measurements .",
    "this process has also been considered in @xcite .",
    "a transition into a three - body final state @xmath25 is also a possible process to explain the miniboone data .",
    "the two decay modes : @xmath26 and @xmath25 are both lepton flavor violating processes and can only occur via new physics mechanism beyond the sm .",
    "if the mechanism proposed above can explain the observed peak which depends on its decay width , the possible detection rate of the number of @xmath11 is roughly @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the muon neutrino number , @xmath29 is the lifetime which should be calculated in the aforementioned scenario and @xmath30 is a detection rate which is also very small , say , @xmath31 or even smaller .",
    "t is the flight time from the source to the detector and since the speed of the beam neutrino is very close to the speed of light , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the distance and approximately 500 m in the miniboone experiments .",
    "in addition the ratio would be further suppressed by the time dilation factor @xmath34 .",
    "since @xmath33 is only of several hundred meters , to make a sizable ratio which can be observed , @xmath29 must not be large .",
    "we will obtain its value by imputing all the concerned model parameters which are fixed by fitting data of other experiments into our numerical computation .    as is well - known",
    ", neutrino oscillation had been observed in the solar , atmospheric , accelerator neutrino experiments and the present theoretical studies almost completely confirm the msw mechanism .",
    "the relevant mixing parameters and the mass - square differences are determined by fitting the data , even though the absolute values of the neutrino masses are still not fixed yet .",
    "while theoretically determining the parameters , possible neutrino decays are not taken into account seriously . how to reconcile the neutrino decay with the present theoretical works on the neutrino oscillation is an open question , namely , one should explore if there exists discrepancy between the theoretical predictions and data .",
    "obviously if the decay rate is sufficiently small , one does not need to modify the present theoretical framework about the neutrino oscillation , but if the decay rate is not too small , the data fitting should be re - considered , therefore the miniboone result indeed provides a new challenge to the neutrino physics and we will return to this topic in our next work @xcite .",
    "we start with a brief review of the unparticle physics .",
    "first let us consider an unparticle @xmath22 with scale dimension @xmath24 and momentum @xmath35 .",
    "the unparticle momentum satisfies the constraint @xmath18 . according to @xcite",
    ", the unparticle stuff can be viewed as a tower of massive particles with mass spacing tends to zero .",
    "scale invariance provides the most important constraint on the properties of unparticles .",
    "the two - point function of scalar unparticle field operator @xmath36 is written as 0|o_(x ) o^_(0)|0=e^-ipx    with momentum @xmath35 and the phase space factor is    vector unparticle field @xmath37 , we have 0|o_^(0)|pp|o_^(0)|0(p^2)= a_d_(p^0)(p^2)(-g^+p^ p^/p^2)(p^2)^d_-2 , where the transverse condition @xmath38 is required .",
    "the lorentz structure of unparticle can also be tensor @xcite or spinor @xcite . in this study",
    ", we restrict our discussions to scalar and vector unparticles .",
    "obviously similar analysis can be done for the tensor and spinor unparticles .    about the virtual effects ,",
    "the propagator of the scalar unparticle field is given as d^4 x e^ipx0 |to_(x)o_(0)|0&= & i e^-i(d_-2 ) , and for the vector unparticle field , the propagator is d^4 x e^ipx0    @xmath39 at the denominator implies that the scale dimension @xmath24 can not be integers for @xmath40 in order to avoid singularity .",
    "the phase factor @xmath41 provides a cp conserving phase which produces peculiar interference effects in high energy scattering processes @xcite and cp violation in b decays @xcite .    in this study",
    ", we will discuss interactions between the unparticles and neutrinos .",
    "the framework which describes these interactions is a low energy effective theory . for our purpose , the coupling of unparticle to neutrinos ( @xmath8 and @xmath11 )",
    "is given in the form as _",
    "eff=| _ _ ( 1-_5)_^o _ + | _ _ ( 1-_5)_o_^+h.c . . here",
    ", we have used the @xmath42 type current as in the sm .",
    "the @xmath43 and @xmath44 are dimensionless coefficients .",
    "the @xmath45 and @xmath46 are weak eigenstates with different flavor numbers @xmath47 and @xmath48 .    as in @xcite , the neutrino decay is conveniently represented in the basis of mass eigenstates @xmath20 ( i=1,2 , we only consider two generations in this case ) .",
    "the interactions between unparticle and neutrinos are rewritten by | _",
    "j_(1-_5)_i o_^+h.c . .",
    "the relation between the coupling coefficients @xmath49 and @xmath50 can be obtained from neutrino mixing matrix . for a simple case , considering two neutrino mixing ,",
    "(    c _ e + _    ) = (    cc cos & -sin + sin & cos    ) (    c _ 1 + _ 2    ) , the coefficients in the mass basis are related to those in the flavor basis by c_s(v)^_1_2=cos^2   c_s(v)^__. for a maximal mixing where @xmath51 , @xmath52 . the coefficients in the different basis differ by a constant factor .      assuming two generation neutrinos and the heavier one is @xmath1 and lighter is @xmath2 , the decay of @xmath26 is realized via the transition @xmath21 which is a typical lepton flavor violating process and its feynman diagram is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . here",
    ", it is natural to assume that the basis of the interaction between unparticle and neutrino is the same as the weak interaction , namely @xmath11 and @xmath14 are the eigenstates of the interaction .",
    "the final unparticle is invisible and behaves as a missing energy .",
    "the decay @xmath21 seems to be a two - body process .",
    "but it is different from the common case with two final particles whose momenta are single - valued and fixed . for the unparticle case ,",
    "the energy of @xmath2 depends on the momentum square of unparticle @xmath53 which only is constrained by the condition @xmath18 .",
    "namely , one can expect that @xmath53 can vary within a range @xmath54 where @xmath55 would be determined by the momenutum conservation in @xmath14 decay .",
    "thus the varying @xmath53 causes a continuous energy spectrum of @xmath56 and it is a characteristic effect of the unparticle .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "motivated by the new measurement of the miniboone collaboration , which observed an excess of electron - like events at low energy , it motivates us to search for a possible mechanism beyond the sm to explain this phenomenon ,",
    "so the first idea which hits our mind is that @xmath1 might decay into @xmath2 accompanied by some other very light products .",
    "we should testify if this scenario can produce results which are theoretically plausible and can explain the data",
    ".    there may be several possible modes , the first one is @xmath57 which is a three - body decay , the second one is @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a single boson particle , for example an axion etc . , and the third one is @xmath60 where @xmath22 represents an unparticle .",
    "all the three possibilities can not be realized in the framework of the sm , so new physics beyond the sm is necessary .",
    "the first one was numerically estimated in this work and our results indicate that the decay rate determined by the three - body decay mode is too small and is ruled out immediately .",
    "the second mode is a two - body decay , therefore the spectrum of the electron neutrinos is discrete and it is not consistent with the measurement of the miniboone .",
    "even though we consider the energy spreading of the incident muon neutrino beam , the shape of the resultant electron neutrino bump can not be well understood in this scenario .",
    "therefore the third candidate is the most favorable . in this work ,",
    "we work out the formulations of neutrino decays within the framework of unparticle physics .",
    "the formulations in the laboratory frame are given for the first time .",
    "the smallness of the decay width given by our numerical results indicates that the unparticle scenario may not explain the excess of electron neutrinos at low energy .",
    "the life time predicted in the unparticle model is qualitatively consistent with the the cosmological constraint @xcite which is about @xmath61 sec . by eq .",
    "( 1 ) , we know the suppression of @xmath62 with @xmath63 sec . , would kill any possibility of observing a decay event .",
    "the reasons are : ( 1 ) very tiny neutrino mass ( 2 ) very weak interactions between the unparticle and neutrino .",
    "since our numerical results are consistent with the cosmology constraints and the results by other authors @xcite , we can be convinced that the calculation is right , but the proposal does not work here .",
    "thus in this work , we definitely obtain a negative conclusion that the peak of electron - neutrino at lower energy observed by the minimoone collaboration can not be explained by the neutrino decay . on other aspect ,",
    "the phenomenon is there and demands theoretical explanations , so that we propose another scenario which might overcome the aforementioned restrictions which forbid the appearance of electron neutrinos to appear at low energy for the miniboone experiments .",
    "we will present the scenario in our next work .",
