    "wikipedia ( wp ) is a truly amazing product of the 21st century .",
    "it is a free online encyclopedia edited by volunteers , which has achieved within short period of time enormous success : this encyclopedia , which practically anyone can contribute to has a comparable reliability to the highly professional encyclopedia britannica @xcite and has got by now the number one general work of reference in everyday practice .",
    "the main question related to wikipedia is : how can an encyclopedia be reliable if anyone can edit it ?",
    "the _ bon mot _ of wikipedians is not a satisfactory answer , namely that `` it works only in practice . in theory",
    ", it can never work . ''",
    "the literature about wp is overwhelming . without seeking completeness , okoli et  al .",
    "@xcite tracked more than 2000 related articles .",
    "however , there are rather comprehensive reviews , e.g. , @xcite and an overview of the visibility of wp in scholarly publications @xcite . in addition , there are also online platforms to collect and index wp - related academic literature ; among them are `` wikilit '' @xcite , `` acawiki '' and `` wikipapers . ''",
    "a monthly review of the most recent scholarly studies on wp is also available at `` wikimedia research newsletter . ''",
    "first wikipedia studies were mostly on its size and growth , showing an initial exponential growth @xcite , which was later reported to be saturating by other authors @xcite .",
    "another main line of wp research is focused on vandalism detection @xcite . assessing user reputation @xcite and investigating",
    "the articles quality @xcite are other two important topics .",
    "to understand the management system of wp , there have been interesting studies on user authority , adminship , governance and promotion strategy @xcite , in addition to analysis of wp policies and bureaucracy @xcite . a considerable amount of wp policies are on what to be / not to be in wp .",
    "consequently , there are studies on topical coverage and notability of entries @xcite .",
    "seeing wp as a network of articles , various researchers offer analysis and models for topology and growth of the wikigraph @xcite , whereas some others used wp to build up knowledge taxonomies and semantic structures @xcite .",
    "masucci et al",
    ". showed that semantic space has a scale - free structure by analyzing information extracted from wp @xcite .",
    "more to the sociological side , restivo and van de rijt studied the effect of social awards on users activity @xcite and lam et  al . explored the gender imbalance among wp editors @xcite .",
    "massa presented an algorithm to extract the social network of editors @xcite , and danescu - niculescu - mizil et  al .",
    "have studied talk page conversations to observe the relation between language coordination and social power of editors @xcite .",
    "clearly , scholarly studies in the field of peer - production go beyond wp and for instance roth et  al .",
    "studied dynamics of communities of wiki - based projects in the whole `` wikisphere '' @xcite .",
    "finally , in a rather different approach , mestyn et al . have made use of wp edit and page view data to predict the movies box office revenue @xcite .    our motivation to study wikipedia comes from the need of understanding the laws of modern collaborative value production .",
    "this is of great importance as in our increasingly complex world the role of information communication technology ( ict ) mediated peer collaboration is expected to become more and more important in the future . due to its relation to ict , the methods of `` computational social science '' ( css ) @xcite are adequate tools of investigation of such collaborations .",
    "css is a truly multidisciplinary endeavor with a considerable contributions from physicists ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the main difference between traditional social science and css is that the latter is data driven : it uses the digital footprints we leave behind in almost all our activities in the digital era @xcite .",
    "collaboration has always been fundamental to most human achievements .",
    "modern information communication technology opens up entirely new ways of cooperation , where partners can interact remotely with an unprecedented speed exchanging extremely large amount of information .",
    "tim barners - lee developed originally the world wide web @xcite at cern in order to create an appropriate platform for huge collaborations , which are ubiquitous in high energy physics .",
    "another important example is that of free software development as defined by the free software foundation .",
    "nowadays all major scientific projects from the human genome to hubble space telescope rely heavily on ict mediated collaboration but even on smaller scale we often use current version management , wiki @xcite and related environments to increase efficiency .",
    "wp is a paradigmatic example of collaborative environment with the additional advantage that all the changes and interactions are well documented and publicly available , which makes it particularly suitable for scientific studies .",
    "many questions arise when studying wp from our point of view .",
    "what are the characteristic features of editorial activities ? how are they related to other examples of human dynamics , which have been intensively studied in css @xcite ?",
    "what is the mechanism behind the emergence of an article ?",
    "how can the complexity of the product of the cooperation , namely that of the articles be characterized ? how do conflicts emerge and get resolved ? in the following we will present analysis of wp data in order to contribute to the clarification of these questions .    to accustom the unfamiliar readers to the terminology and work - flow of wikipedia , in the next section we briefly review main tools and objects in the wikimedia platform .",
    "familiar readers are encouraged to skip this section . in section  [ sec : methods ] , we explain different methods and sources for collecting wp data , and in section  [ sec : results ] , a summary of our recent @xcite and some new results is provided and compared to the related reports by other authors .",
    "we close the paper with a conclusion ( section  [ sec : conclusion ] ) .",
    "wp has more than 280 language editions at the moment .",
    "main concepts and structures are similar in all language editions with little variations due to local modifications by the editors community of the specific edition .",
    "later we will deal with several wps , however , whenever it is not specified else explicitly , the english wp is meant .    describing the structure of wp",
    ", there are two main elements to name , i ) articles ii ) wp editors , also called `` wikipedians '' .",
    "the rest is all about the internal and inter - element connections and interactions of the members of these two groups , which we name `` accessories '' in this paper .",
    "wikipedia , similarly to any other encyclopedia consists of entries about different topics , hereafter called articles .",

    "heterogeneity is present in the level of activity .",
    "not only the total number of edits by each editor has a largely extended distribution @xcite , but also the number of different articles each editor contributes to is varying considerably from one editor to another @xcite . finally , the number of editors contributing to an article has also a fat - tailed distribution ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : user - article ] ) , however , with a lower cut - off when we only consider a selection of `` featured articles '' , which are supposed to be articles with high level of completeness and accuracy .",
    "one source of the inhomogeneity is that statistical characteristics of editors show time evolution ; different phases can be identified in the editorial behavior as they get more and more mature .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig : edit - article ] the number of edits per different articles as a measure of the editors focus , versus total number of edits , calculated for a large sample of editors ( all editors with at least 1 edit ) is showed .",
    "the general trend is as follows : editors start by less intensive edits on different pages , then gradually they get more focused on few articles and the ratio of the number of edits per number of different articles increases .",
    "once they reach a level of maturity , again their field of interest becomes wider and finally extremely senior editors , distribute they editorial efforts on a huge number of articles .",
    "note that this is the average trend and it may differ from editor to editor . in the same plot , same quantity is shown for a sample of `` bad editors '' who have been blocked from editing at least 7 times per 1000 edits .",
    "although the overall trend is the same as the whole sample , but a larger peak , indicating more intensive focus on few pages , is clearly visible .",
    "this is very intuitive : editors seeking conflict and having the tendency to violate the guidelines have special interests in a limited number of pages , where they disturb the collaborative environment .",
    "since all edits are recorded along with a timestamp , it is very convenient to perform temporal analysis on editorial activities at different time scales .",
    "[ [ burstiness ] ] burstiness : + + + + + + + + + + +    most of the editors do their edits following a certain type of inhomogeneous temporal pattern .",
    "there are periods or bursts of high activity separated by low or no activity intervals .",
    "compared to a homogeneous poisson process the distribution of the inter - event times has a much fatter tail in the case of a bursty pattern .",
    "one trivial source of the temporal inhomogeneity is the circadian pattern of human activity .",
    "however , recently it was shown by introducing the notion of bursty periods that `` burstiness '' often origins from memory effects and reinforcement mechanisms @xcite .",
    "these bursty periods are separated by intervals of length @xmath0 of no activity and the distribution of the number of events in the bursty periods follows a power law in contrast to the memory free case , where it is exponential .",
    "our investigations on short time scale temporal features of editorial activities , reveal strong evidences for the presence of similar mechanisms @xcite .",
    "for instance , in fig .",
    "[ fig : user - burst ] two characteristic measures of temporal patterns for the activity train of a class of active users are shown .",
    "first , the distribution of inter - edit time intervals ( fig .",
    "[ fig : user - burst ]  ( a ) ) is extremely fat - tailed , indicating the presence of long silence periods .",
    "second , the distribution of the number of edits in bursty periods follows a power law , which is not sensitive to the choice of @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : user - burst ]  ( b ) ) .",
    "however , in the absence of memory effects , these the latter would be an exponential distribution @xcite , as it is indeed the case when we shuffle the data fig .",
    "[ fig : user - burst ]  ( b ) .    .",
    "the bump is due to the circadian patter and corresponds to 24 hours .",
    "b ) probability distribution function of the number of edits in the bursty periods separated by windows of silence with the width of at least @xmath0 .",
    "color circles are the original data and empty squares corresponds to the shuffled sequence .",
    "the exponent of the power - law fit is @xmath1 and the decay for the shuffled data tends to an exponential form . from panels",
    "( b ) it becomes clear that there is long term correlations in edit trains at the level of editors in addition to broad distribution of time intervals shown in panel ( a ) .",
    "_ these figures were originally published in @xcite under the terms of the creative commons attribution license._,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    ung and dalle , also reported a power law distribution of the inter - edits time intervals and interpreted their observation as an outcome of editors focus on few certain tasks ( articles ) .",
    "they measured the slope for different class of users and showed that more / less skewed distributions correspond to more focused / dispersed editors @xcite .",
    "[ [ daily - patterns ] ] daily patterns : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    as mentioned above , the activity pattern of individual editors are quite heterogeneous in time .",
    "however , if we consider the whole editorial pool of a language edition of wikipedia , we can define an average activity level for all editors which also has its own large scale characteristics .",
    "in @xcite , it is shown that wp is mostly edited between 1  pm and 11  pm , almost in a universal manner for all language editions .",
    "this is in accord with the results in @xcite .",
    "deviations from this universality originates from cultural differences and working habits , such that language editions with more editors from countries with longer working hours , are even more edited in later time in evening and around midnight .",
    "in addition , for more global language editions , the activity curves are flattened , due to contributions from different time zones ( see [ sec : origin ] ) .",
    "[ [ weekly - patterns ] ] weekly patterns : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    weekly patterns are quite universal within one wp and different wps can be classified in different categories based on the activity pattern of their editors @xcite .",
    "for example , german , english , spanish , and italian wps are mostly edited during the working days , in contrast to japanese , korean , and chinese wps being mostly edited on weekends .",
    "our findings are in accord with @xcite but in contrast with @xcite .",
    "however , the latter work studied a sample of four languages only and a shorter monitoring time , and we believe that these lead to the conclusion that editorial activity in wp `` while showing a clear diurnal pattern , do not have a clear weekday - weekend pattern . ''      as mentioned earlier in section .",
    "[ sec : editors ] , personal information of editors is rarely available .",
    "that includes their nationality and living place .",
    "however , to understand many aspects of social characteristics of the editors societies , as well as conflicts and potential biases in content , such information could be crucial . to achieve exact data on the location of editors",
    ", analysis must be restricted to unregistered users with edits recorded along with ip addresses , whose edits are typically between 5% to 10% of the total community contributions in different language editions , and clearly not representing the whole community . moreover , a considerable part of such editors are atypical ( vandals , single act editors ) .",
    "nevertheless , hardy et  al . followed edits of 2.8 million such editors and geolocated them and the edited articles . by counting the number of edits as a function of distance between editor and article , an exponentially decaying distance dependence",
    "was obtained @xcite .",
    "cohen has investigated the contribution of unregistered editors to english wp and concluded that most of unregistered edits are from large cities and metropolitan areas @xcite .",
    "however , normalization to population of regions seems to be a missing essential for such conclusion .",
    "based on the results on daily patterns of editing for geographically localized wps , such as german , italian , hungarian and defining a `` standard activity pattern '' , one could estimate the global distribution of editors to global language wps in the following way ; initially some candidate regions , from which large population of editors would contribute to the given wp are selected . in the next step ,",
    "a linearly weighted superposition of standard activity patterns shifted to the local time of the candidate regions is made . by minimizing the difference between this composed activity pattern and the activity pattern constructed from the real data , a set of optimal weights",
    "is obtained . clearly , these weights are proportional to the share of editors contributing from the corresponding regions . surprisingly , it turned out that english wp is almost equally edited by north americans and editors from the rest of the world @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : share ] , estimations for the share of contributions from different regions to each language edition are shown .",
    "as mentioned above , each editor has her own unique characteristics and editorial personality .",
    "however , similar patterns could be observed by considering types of edits . in a novel approach , wettenberg et  al . established a visualization method to illustrate different editorial actions , e.g. adding , spelling correction , reverting , etc . in a time sequence . in the next step based on the patterns of activity",
    "they could distinguish different kinds , namely systematic activity , reactive and mixture activity patterns @xcite .",
    "kittur et  al .",
    "have classified editors based on number of edits and also specifically followed admins contributions from the inception of wp @xcite .",
    "they concluded that in the beginning of the wp history , large amount of contributions were offered by ",
    "elite users , however , it has gradually changed in a way that after 2004 , average users overtook the elites . by counting the number of added and removed words for different editors , they suggest that elite users in average add more words per edit compared to normal editors .",
    "we considered the volume of contributions by measuring the volume of each edit in unit of characters .",
    "naturally , negative volume is assigned to deletion . in fig .",
    "[ fig : volume ] two examples of edit volume profile of two different type of users is shown : fig .",
    "[ fig : volume ]  ( a ) shows a typical `` producer '' and fig .  [",
    "fig : volume ]  ( b ) shows a typical `` maintainer '' , it is needless to mention that there are many different type of users , but by analyzing the edit volume profile of few tens of most active editors , these two types are found dominantly . in other words , although the results shown here are for two single editors , they are representative of large groups of editors , who can be categorized in one of the these groups based on their edit volume profile .",
    "note that , for the case of producer editors , a separation between additions in the size of  sentences ( first peak ) or `` paragraphs '' ( second peak ) is nicely visible .",
    "the content of wikipedia is generated by large number of editors collaboratively and without any professional or external supervision .",
    "that makes the resulting written language of wp articles a unique multilingual corpus of natural languages .",
    "a single sentence in wp might be written , edited and polished by various editors many times , therefore any personalization bias is eliminated on large scales .",
    "moreover , the fully recorded history of articles give the opportunity to follow the short time scale evolution of language and characterize the gradual changes of written language in the digital era . finally , since wp is huge , and available in many different languages , statistical approaches can be taken in a proper way .    in a practical perspective , tyers and pienaar used wp to extract pairs of corresponding words in different languages @xcite .",
    "serrano et al , used wp corpus along with two others , to build up statistical models concerning fundamental concepts of patterns of word appearance in the text and vocabulary size @xcite .",
    "gabrilovich and markovitch , introduced a method to calculate semantic relatedness of text fragments by extracting a `` high - dimensional space of concepts '' from wp @xcite . in a recent paper @xcite kornai argued that the maturity of wp and the activity on it are important indicators for the chances of survival of a language in the digital age .",
    "our approach to wp as a text corpus is based on readability measures .",
    "we analyzed the readability of the english wp by applying the `` fog index '' @xcite , a simple empirical formula suggested by gunning in the middle of the last century for the english language : @xmath2 where , complex words are those with three or larger syllables .",
    "the readability measure @xmath3 is interpreted as the length of needed education time in years , to be able to read and understand the text .",
    "we found out that the overall @xmath3 of english wp is high with @xmath4 compared to other standard english corpora , for instance british national corpus with @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "however , readability is not homogeneous among articles in different topics .",
    "we observed that articles on more sophisticated topics or concepts , especially in science and philosophy are less readable than , e.g. , biographical articles .",
    "an interesting language edition of wp is `` simple wikipedia '' , which is meant to be a proper reference for readers with weaker knowledge of english , e.g. , children , language learners or non - native speakers .",
    "editors of simple wp are explicitly requested to use a simpler language , limited vocabulary , less complex words , shorter sentences , and easy structures .    in a recent work @xcite ,",
    "simple is examined by measuring the flesch reading score @xcite and it is found that simple is not simple enough compared to other english texts , however with a positive trend in time towards more simplicity .",
    "there have been also attempts to use simple wp for establishing text simplification algorithms @xcite , however with the assumption that simple wp is really simple .",
    "the comparison of simple and english wps enables to study the ability of the editors to fulfill a preset task ( namely enhance readability ) and , at the same time , it also sheds more light to the concept of language complexity in general .",
    "we measured the readability index for a sample extracted from simple wp @xcite .",
    "we fund it to be @xmath6 , i.e. , indeed much lower than for the english wp but just as large as a corpus made of wall street journal articles .    to further analyze language complexity of simple wp",
    ", we made the statistics at the word level , and surprisingly observed that vocabulary richness of simple is comparable to that of main english wp .",
    "moreover , by examining two fundamental laws of linguistics , namely zipf s law @xcite and herdan - heaps law @xcite , we again confirmed that vocabulary richness of simple and main english wp are not significantly different @xcite , although the directives explicitly suggest self - restriction in this respect for simple editors .",
    "detailed analysis of longer units ( n - grams ) of words shows that the language of simple is indeed less complex than that of main but due to more frequent use of predefined language blocks , e.g. , chains of words in the length of 4 or 5 words in simple .",
    "lengths of sentences are also shorter in simple compared to main .",
    "one can conclude that simple editors solved fairly well the task to write more readable texts as compared to those in the main english wp without following slavishly the directives but mostly by reducing the variation of language compounds .      in the process of creating a common product by various agents , occurrence of controversies due to different opinions",
    "are unavoidable .",
    "wp is neither an exception in this sense . wp editorial wars and disputes are known and studied phenomena @xcite .",
    "editorial wars could be evoked both by internal and external causes .",
    "for example life events of celebrities @xcite or natural disasters @xcite could conduct flows of editors to an article leading to tensions and disagreements .",
    "apic et  al",
    ". showed that disputes in wp are corresponding to real world geopolitical instabilities in many cases @xcite . to study editorial wars in details ,",
    "the first step is to establish an algorithm to locate and rank the debated articles among the relatively large number @xcite of peacefully written ones .",
    "there are different proposals for this goal in the literature @xcite . in the following section we briefly describe our previously established method @xcite for locating and ranking editorial wars .",
    "the algorithm to identify disputed articles , introduced in @xcite , is based on counting mutual reverts by pairs of editors , i.e. when an editor undoes another editor s edit completely . to detect reverts ,",
    "we first assign a md5 hash code @xcite to each revision of the article and then by comparing the hash codes , detect when two versions in the history line are exactly the same . in this case ,",
    "the latest edit ( leading to the second identical revision ) is marked as a revert , and a pair of editors , namely a reverting and a reverted one , are labeled .",
    "a `` mutual revert '' is recognized if a pair of editors @xmath7 is observed once with @xmath8 and once with @xmath9 as the reverter .",
    "the weight of an editor @xmath8 is defined as the number of edits @xmath10 performed by her , and the weight of a mutually reverting pair is defined as the minimum of the weights of the two editors .",
    "the controversiality @xmath11 of an article is defined by summing the weights of all mutually reverting editor pairs , excluding the topmost pair , and multiplying this number by the total number of editors @xmath12 involved in the article . in formula ,",
    "@xmath13 where @xmath14 is the number of edits on the article committed by reverting / reverted editor .",
    "the sum is taken over mutual reverts rather than single reverts because reverting is very much part of the normal workflow , especially for defending articles from vandalism .",
    "the minimum of the two weights is used because conflicts between two senior editors contributing more to controversiality than conflicts between a junior and a senior editor , or between two junior editors . in fig .",
    "[ fig : revert ] , a network representation of mutual reverts of the article on `` anarchism '' in english wp is shown .",
    "clearly , as the time goes on , more mutual reverts could happen in the history of the article .",
    "this makes @xmath11 a dynamic , monotonically increasing variable . having calculated @xmath11 for all articles , we are able to find and rank most disputed ones and investigate them in details .",
    "we carried out a detailed comparative study of possible single measures and found that @xmath11 is in most cases as good as its alternatives if not better with the additional advantage of being applicable to different languages .",
    "the superiority of our single parameter measure was reinforced by a recent independent investigation @xcite .",
    "[ [ controversial - topics ] ] controversial topics : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    based on the calculated controversy measure for articles in different languages , first conclusion is that , although there are sever editorial wars on some articles , but most of the articles in different languages evolve rather peacefully .",
    "however , the truly disputed articles consume a considerable amount of editorial resources .",
    "interesting patterns are observed by comparing the debated titles in different language editions @xcite .",
    "for instance , issues related to politics and religion are commonly among the most disputed articles in many language wps , whereas , some category of topics only become controversial in specific languages . science and philosophy in french and soccer clubs in spanish wps",
    "are examples of locally debated topics .",
    "there are even articles , in top of the controversy list in one wp , which is not even covered in other language edition , or does not have a separate article .",
    "here examples are detailed articles around `` bahai faith '' related topics in persian wp . finally , surprisingly , in the hebrew wp , sport is debated as much as religion and politics .",
    "the understanding of the emergence of conflicts , their escalation and resolution is important for maintaining wp and may give hints in general for techniques of conflict management .",

    "was also found to be rather small ( c=0.05 ) , considering the whole sample of articles in english wp .",
    "we also considered smaller samples of `` featured '' and `` controversial '' articles , based on the lists described in section  [ sec : article ] and compared them to a sample of articles selected randomly .",
    "when looking at the distribution of the burstiness @xmath22 we could not find significant differences between the three categories of articles .",

    "[ fig : article - e ] clearly shows that in the sample of disputed article , edits come in condense bursty trains with long range memories , whereas the statistics of the number of edits in the bursty periods in peaceful articles is much closer to an uncorrelated process ( signalized both by the data point from the shuffled sequence and the exponential fit ) . in a recent paper @xcite",

    "the correlation between talk page length and @xmath11 for the english wp is much more significant ( c=0.54 ) than that with the edit frequency .",

    "ii ) stepwise conflicts , fig .",
    "[ fig : m - n ]  ( b ) ; after the first cycle of conflict - resolution , the consensus state might be altered mainly because of one of two reasons , namely occurrence of an external event which generates new controversy or arrival of new editors , who are not satisfied with the previously compromised content of the article .",
    "therefore , other conflict - resolution cycles may appear in the overall history of the article .",
    "iii ) never - ending war , fig .",
    "[ fig : m - n ]  ( c ) ; if the rate of incoming editors or external events related to the topic of the article , is considerably larger than the typical time to reach consensus , even a temporary equilibrium can not be achieved and the increase of @xmath11 becomes permanent .",

    ", scaledwidth=80.0% ]      motivated by empirical results on editorial wars in wp , we aimed at providing a minimalistic agent - based model capturing the main features of the wars  @xcite .",
    "the model belongs to the class of bounded confidence models of opinion dynamics introduced by deffuant et  al .",
    "it consists of two types of elements ; @xmath29 editors and one article . in each monte carlo step , editors interact if their scalar opinions @xmath30 $ ] , @xmath31 are already closer to each other than a threshold value @xmath32 and then they adopt the opinion of the arithmetic mean .",
    "an editor edits the article if she finds it in a state @xmath33 $ ] with a difference larger than @xmath34 to @xmath35 , otherwise she revises her own opinion which gets closer to the article state by an amount controlled by a parameter @xmath36 .",

    "however , the relaxation time to consensus very much depends on the parameters set .",
    "there are three different scenarios to approach the consensus state : i ) for small values of @xmath36 , system needs astronomically long time to reach the final state , although @xmath23 is always very close to the system average of @xmath35 .",

    "iii ) large values of @xmath36 leads to exaggerated fluctuations of @xmath23 , however with fast convergence of extremist editors and a shorter relaxation time compared to the previous cases .",
    "[ [ dynamic - editorial - pool ] ] dynamic editorial pool : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the constant rate of replacement of old editors by new ones with random opinions can hinder the system to reach a time - independent state .",
    "the interplay of two time scales , namely relaxation and renewal leads to three different phases . for small renewal rate ,",
    "the system experiences well separated periods of conflict ( large fluctuation of @xmath23 ) followed by long consensus state , with only minor fluctuations of @xmath23 , whereas for larger rates , even temporary consensus state is never reached and the system is constantly pushed outwards consensus . finally , there is a narrow transition regime in the phase space , in which there are numerous short periods of peace and war appearing consequently .",
    "this three regimes are corresponding to the war scenarios discussed in section .",
