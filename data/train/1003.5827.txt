    "the top quark is the heaviest known particle in the standard model ( sm ) of fundamental interactions . because of its large mass",
    ", it is expected to couple strongly with the fields responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking , and the detailed study of top - quark properties is likely to play a key role in elucidating the origin of particle masses .",
    "the measurement of top - quark related observables is therefore one of the main goals of the fermilab tevatron and cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) . to date , thousands of top - quark events have been observed by two different experiments at the tevatron , and the top - quark mass has been extracted at the percent level @xcite .",
    "the experiments at the lhc are expected to observe millions of top - quark events per year already in the initial low - luminosity phase , bringing the study of the top - quark properties into the realm of precision physics . in particular , the total inclusive cross section for top - quark pair production is expected to be measured with a relative error of @xmath12 to @xmath13 at the lhc @xcite .",
    "in addition to the mass and the total inclusive cross section , kinematic distributions and charge asymmetries are also of interest .",
    "for instance , the @xmath14 invariant mass distribution can be used as a complementary method for measuring @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the presence of bumps in the smoothly decreasing @xmath14 invariant mass distribution would be a clear signal of an @xmath16-channel heavy resonance , which is predicted in many new physics scenarios @xcite .",
    "such searches have been pursued at the tevatron @xcite , and results for the top - pair invariant mass distribution were recently obtained from data collected by the cdf collaboration @xcite .",
    "the forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath14 production has also been measured recently @xcite and shows a potential deviation from the theoretical predictions .    to make optimal use of the experimental measurements",
    "requires theoretical predictions of similar precision . at hadron colliders , a leading - order ( lo )",
    "prediction is usually insufficient , and including higher - order corrections in qcd is mandatory .",
    "current theoretical predictions for @xmath14 production in fixed - order perturbation theory are based on next - to - leading order ( nlo ) calculations of the total cross section @xcite , differential distributions @xcite , and the forward - backward asymmetry @xcite .",
    "the nlo computations suffer from theoretical uncertainties larger than @xmath13 , both for tevatron and lhc center - of - mass energies .",
    "these uncertainties are partly due to our imperfect knowledge of the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , and partly to the truncation of the perturbative series in the strong coupling constant , which introduces a dependence on the unphysical renormalization and factorization scales into the physical predictions .",
    "the latter uncertainty is typically reduced by including more terms in the perturbative series , and for this reason the calculation of the partonic cross section to next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) has been an area of active research .",
    "this includes studies of the two - loop virtual corrections @xcite , the squared one - loop corrections @xcite , and the nlo corrections to the final state @xmath14 + jet @xcite .",
    "however , due to the complexity of the calculations , complete results for the cross section at nnlo are not yet available .    in the absence of full nnlo results ,",
    "one way to improve the nlo predictions is to utilize threshold resummation methods @xcite to incorporate some ( presumably ) dominant contributions from higher orders . for the total cross section",
    ", a common approach is to work in the limit where the top - quark pair is produced nearly at rest , and to resum logarithms in the velocity @xmath17 , with @xmath18 the partonic center - of - mass energy .",
    "such resummations have been carried out at leading - logarithmic ( ll ) @xcite , next - to - leading - logarithmic ( nll ) @xcite , and approximate next - to - next - to - leading - logarithmic ( nnll ) order @xcite . only very recently have the complete expressions at nnll order been obtained @xcite .",
    "the calculation of differential cross sections is more involved due to the appearance of several kinematic variables .",
    "a typical approach in that case is to work in the threshold limit where the parameter @xmath19 , with @xmath1 the invariant mass of the @xmath0 pair , and to resum logarithms in @xmath20 . in that case",
    "real gluon emission is soft , but the parameter @xmath21 is a generic @xmath22 variable .",
    "the current frontier for resummation in this limit is nll calculations for differential cross sections @xcite and the forward - backward asymmetry @xcite .",
    "in addition , approximate nnll calculations were performed in @xcite . extending these results to full nnll order",
    "has been made possible by our recent calculation of the two - loop anomalous - dimension matrices @xcite .",
    "we have presented an approximate nnlo formula for the @xmath14 invariant mass distribution in @xcite .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to derive a renormalization - group ( rg ) improved expression for the doubly differential cross section at nnll order , in which all threshold - enhanced terms are resummed .",
    "we will match this expression with the exact fixed - order nlo results and study the top - pair invariant mass distribution , the forward - backward asymmetry , and the total cross section at nlo+nnll order .",
    "an important part of our analysis is a comparison of the total cross section obtained here with those obtained in the limit @xmath23 .",
    "the outcome of this comparison leads us to conclude that the predictions obtained in this paper are the most precise available at present .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : kin ] we review the kinematics and the structure of factorization in the threshold region .",
    "we then derive the factorization formula for the hard - scattering kernels into products of hard and soft matrices using soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) in section  [ sec : scetfact ] . in section  [ sec : matching ] we present the calculation of the hard and soft matrices at nlo , and describe several checks on our results .",
    "section  [ sec : resummation ] deals with the rg properties of the hard and soft functions .",
    "we derive a formula for the resummed cross section in momentum space using rg methods and describe its evaluation at nnll order .",
    "we also review the derivation of the approximate nnlo formula , which has been presented first in @xcite . in section  [ sec : pheno ] we perform numerical studies of the invariant mass distribution , the total cross section , and the forward - backward asymmetry , utilizing both rg - improved perturbation theory at nnll order and the nnlo approximate formula .",
    "this section includes the aforementioned comparison of different methods for obtaining the total cross section .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we consider the process @xmath24 where @xmath25 is an inclusive hadronic final state .. ] at born level this proceeds through the @xmath26 annihilation and gluon - fusion channels @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we define the kinematic invariants @xmath30 and momentum conservation at born level implies @xmath31 .",
    "in this section we consider the structure of the differential cross section near the partonic threshold . while the fully differential cross section depends on three kinematic variables , in this paper we are mainly interested in the doubly differential cross section expressed in terms of the invariant mass @xmath1 of the @xmath14 pair and the scattering angle @xmath32 between @xmath33 and @xmath34 in the partonic center - of - mass frame . to describe this distribution",
    "we introduce the variables @xmath35 the quantity @xmath36 gives the 3-velocity of the top quarks in the @xmath14 rest frame .",
    "one often considers a related variable @xmath37 , which coincides with @xmath36 in the limit @xmath38 .    before moving on",
    ", we would like to clarify our definition of the so - called `` threshold region '' .",
    "in general , the definition of this region depends on the measured observable .",
    "for instance , to describe the total inclusive cross section , one often considers the limit @xmath23 @xcite . to describe the @xmath14 invariant mass distribution , on the other hand",
    ", we consider the limit @xmath38 , with @xmath36 a generic @xmath39 variable . in that case",
    "the top quarks are not produced at rest , nor are they highly boosted , and the emitted partons in the final state @xmath25 are constrained to be soft .",
    "this threshold limit is often referred to in the literature as the pair - invariant - mass kinematics , and the theoretical framework to deal with this situation was developed in @xcite .",
    "a closely related framework can be applied to processes where only a single top - quark is observed @xcite , but will not be considered here .",
    "threshold resummation at fixed invariant mass @xmath1 is completely analogous to the well - studied case of drell - yan or higgs production , and it becomes more and more important as @xmath1 is increased .",
    "therefore , the rg - improved result for @xmath40 offers the best possible prediction for this observable .",
    "moreover , integrating this distribution over @xmath1 then yields the best possible prediction for the total cross section .",
    "in particular , we believe that in this way we obtain a better description of the total cross section than the usual approach of resumming soft gluon and coulomb terms for @xmath41 .",
    "the reason is that at the tevatron and lhc , the cross section is dominated by events with @xmath420.6 , which is not especially small .",
    "we will come back to this important point in section  [ sec : totcross ] .    according to the qcd factorization theorem @xcite",
    ", the differential cross section in @xmath1 and @xmath43 can be written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the factorization scale , and the parton luminosity functions @xmath46 are defined by @xmath47 the @xmath48 are universal non - perturbative pdfs of the parton @xmath49 in the hadron @xmath50 , which can be extracted from experimental data .",

    "it can be obtained from the expression for @xmath54 by replacing @xmath63 , which is a symmetry at tree level but not beyond .    at higher orders in @xmath52",
    "the hard - scattering kernels receive corrections from virtual loop diagrams and real gluon emissions in the @xmath64 and @xmath65 channels , as well as from other partonic channels such as @xmath66 .",
    "the calculation of these corrections near threshold is greatly simplified .",
    "for @xmath38 there is no phase - space available for hard gluon emission , which is thus suppressed by powers of @xmath20 .",
    "moreover , contributions from channels such as @xmath66 , which involve external soft - quark fields , are also suppressed . the partonic scattering process is thus dominated by virtual corrections and the real emission of soft gluons .",
    "the phase - space for such processes is effectively that for a two - body final state , so the hard - scattering kernels can be written in terms of the kinematic invariants from the born - level processes .",
    "therefore , up to corrections of order @xmath20 , we can rewrite ( [ eq : genfact ] ) in the threshold region as @xmath67 \\",

    "we will derive this formula in the next section , using techniques from scet .",
    "( a similar factorization formula in mellin moment space was derived in @xcite . )",
    "the hard functions are related to the virtual corrections and are ordinary functions of their arguments , while the soft functions are related to the real emission of soft gluons and contain singular distributions in @xmath20 .",
    "in addition to terms proportional to @xmath56 , the @xmath73-th order corrections in @xmath52 also contain plus distributions of the form @xmath74_+ ; \\qquad m = 0,\\ldots,2n-1 \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath75_+ g(z ) = \\int_\\tau^1 dz \\",

    "these singular distributions make the perturbative series badly convergent near threshold and must be resummed to all orders in perturbation theory . in this paper",
    "we perform such a resummation directly in momentum space @xcite , up to nnll order . to this end",
    ", we extend the procedure for deep - inelastic scattering @xcite , drell - yan process @xcite , higgs production @xcite , and direct photon production @xcite to processes with four colored external particles .",
    "the formalism will be described in section  [ sec : resummation ] .",
    "in this section we derive the factorization formula ( [ eq : threfact ] ) for the hard - scattering kernels in the threshold region using scet @xcite and heavy - quark effective theory ( hqet ) ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "the derivation is similar to the ones in @xcite , but is more complicated due to the presence of additional dirac and color structures .",
    "the derivation of factorization in the effective theory relies on a two - step matching procedure . in the first step ,",
    "fluctuations at the hard scale from virtual corrections are integrated out by matching qcd onto an effective - theory with collinear and soft degrees of freedom .",
    "the wilson coefficients from this matching step give the hard function when squaring the amplitude . in the second step , the soft degrees of freedom are integrated out , giving rise to a soft function , which is defined as the vacuum expectation value of a wilson loop operator .",
    "the scattering amplitude for @xmath14 production involves several scales , which we assume to satisfy @xmath77 in the threshold region .",
    "the elements of the first set of scales are taken to be of the same order and shall be collectively referred to as hard scales , whereas @xmath78 defines the soft scale .",
    "the small quantity @xmath79 then serves as the expansion parameter in the effective theory . note that we treat @xmath1 and @xmath15 as of the same order , which means that the top quarks are not highly boosted . to describe the invariant mass spectrum in the region where @xmath80",
    ", a more appropriate treatment would require a different effective theory to separate these two scales , and two jet functions have to be introduced for the top and anti - top quarks .",
    "such an approach was adopted in @xcite for top - quark production in @xmath81 collisions , where @xmath82 was used as a small expansion parameter . however , given that even for @xmath1 as large as 1.5tev the ratio @xmath83 is still a reasonable @xmath39 parameter , we see no need to adopt it for the present work .",
    "the formalism for scet applied to a generic @xmath73-body scattering process involving both heavy and light partons was set up in @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the effective theory contains two sets of collinear fields to describe the degrees of freedom in the incoming hadrons , two sets of hqet fields to describe the outgoing heavy quarks , and a single set of soft fields describing the final state @xmath25 and the soft interactions among particles . in classifying the collinear fields we define two light - like vectors @xmath73 and @xmath84 in the directions of the colliding partons , which satisfy @xmath85 . the collinear quark fields are related to the qcd fields by @xmath86 the collinear gluon fields in a single collinear sector are identical to those in qcd , with their momenta restricted to be collinear to the given direction . in constructing operators below , it will be convenient to introduce the manifestly gauge - invariant combinations of fields @xcite @xmath87 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath73-collinear wilson line is defined by @xmath88 and @xmath89 denotes path ordering .",

    ", this property leads to the factorized form ( [ eq : threfact ] ) for the hard - scattering kernels .",
    "a complication is that the color indices on the wilson lines representing the soft - gluon interactions act on the color structures ( [ eq : colorstructures ] ) and can mix them into each other .",

    "<S> precision predictions for phenomenologically interesting observables such as the @xmath0 invariant mass distribution and forward - backward asymmetry in top - quark pair production at hadron colliders require control over the differential cross section in perturbative qcd . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we improve existing calculations of the doubly differential cross section in the invariant mass and scattering angle by using techniques from soft - collinear effective theory to perform an nnll resummation of threshold logarithms , which become large when the invariant mass @xmath1 of the top - quark pair approaches the partonic center - of - mass energy @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we also derive an approximate formula for the differential cross section at nnlo in fixed - order perturbation theory , which completely determines the coefficients multiplying the singular plus distributions in the variable @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we then match our results in the threshold region with the exact results at nlo in fixed - order perturbation theory , and perform a numerical analysis of the invariant mass distribution , the total cross section , and the forward - backward asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that these are the most accurate predictions available for these observables at present . using mstw2008nnlo parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) along with @xmath4 and @xmath5gev </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain for the inclusive production cross sections at the tevatron and lhc the values @xmath6pb and @xmath7pb , where the first error results from scale variations while the second reflects pdf uncertainties .    </S>",
