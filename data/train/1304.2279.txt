    "understanding topological order in extended systems is one of the major challenges in modern physics .",
    "such an issue has immediate spinoff in condensed matter physics@xcite , but encompasses important aspects of quantum information as well@xcite .",
    "topologically ordered systems are ( generically ) gapped systems characterized by a specific degeneracy of the ground states@xcite .",
    "the main attraction for quantum computation applications relays on the intrinsic robustness of such an order to external perturbations .",
    "indeed such a property is nothing but a rephrasing that no local order parameter can be defined to characterize topologically ordered states ( elitzur theorem ) .",
    "this turns the main virtue of topological phases into a bottleneck , because any search for such kind of order in actual physical systems is problematic . for the same reason ,",
    "also more generic spin liquids , that may be not topologically ordered , but nevertheless possess a gap and no local order parameter , are long - sought states in nowadays condensed matter physics .",
    "@xcite    in the last few years , topological order in many - body system has been studied resorting to new approaches .",
    "it is believed that topological order can be characterized by the entanglement encoded in the states of the system@xcite .",
    "more precisely , it is understood that such an order is related to a long range entanglement , meaning that topological states can not be adiabatically connected to non - topological ones resorting to quantum circuits made of local ( on the scale of the range of interaction in the underlying hamiltonian ) unitary gates@xcite .",
    "accordingly , any observable that would be able , in principle , to detect the topological order , is intrinsically non local@xcite .",
    "here we push forward the idea that progress can be made on this aspect , by analyzing how topologically ordered ground states change by varying the control parameter , within the quantum phase ( instead of looking at a single copy of ground state corresponding to a fixed value of the control parameter)@xcite .",
    "in particular , we explore whether the ground state ` evolution ' by changing the hamiltonian s control parameter @xmath3 can be achieved by locc , after having bi - partitioned system .",
    "the tool we exploit is provided by the differential local convertibility@xcite : a given physical system is partitioned into two parties , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , limited to local operations on their subsystems and classical inter - party communication ( locc ) .",
    "we comment that the notion of locality we refer does depend on the partition that has been employed ; therefore the locc can indeed involve a portion of the system that can be very non - local on the scale fixed by the interactions in the hamiltonian .",
    "this should be contrasted with the protocols defining the topological order in terms of local unitary transformations mentioned above@xcite .",
    "assuming that @xmath4 and @xmath5 can share an entangled state ( ancilla ) , the differential local convertibility protocol can be feasibly expressed through a specific behavior of the rnyi entropies @xmath6 .",
    "the differential convertibility holds if and only if @xmath7 , @xmath8 , or @xmath9 , @xmath8@xcite . in the present paper",
    "we will be using the latter characterization .",
    "such an approach was first discussed in the realm of quantum critical phenomena in the ref.@xcite . in particular , we note that paramagnets and phases with non vanishing local order parameters are indeed locally convertible@xcite .    in this paper , we focus on spin systems in one spatial dimension , where topological order is protected by the symmetry of the system@xcite .",

    "the convertibility property is encoded in the specific response of the entanglement spectrum to the perturbation : the distribution of eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix get sharpened in the most represented eigenvalues ; this implies that high @xmath78rnyi entropies ca decrease ; at the same time , the spectrum acquires a tail made of small eigenvalues , because more states are involved by increasing the correlation length ( see fig.([convert_cluster ] ) @xmath79 , @xmath80 and fig.([conver_lambdad_symm ] ) @xmath81 , @xmath82 ) ) .",
    "the local convertibility is achieved , when the sharpening is compensated by the tail of the distribution ( see fig.[convert_cluster ] , fig.[conver_lambdad_symm])@xcite .",

    "indeed , similar phenomenon was discovered in the @xmath83 toric code @xcite , corroborating the scenario described in the present paper . in particular , it was noticed that , despite non topologically ordered , also certain spin liquids result non - locally convertible for specific perturbations .",
    "then , an interesting question that arises is concerning the stability of the local convertibility by changing the perturbation .",
    "we observe that , on the other hand , that spin liquids with some symmetry protection , are indeed stable , spanning a well defined quantum phase , distinct from a paramagnet .",
    "the results of the present letter indicate that the same symmetry protection is also able to protect their non local convertibility .",
    "the non local convertibility occurs in the topological phases even for subsystems sizes _ smaller than the correlation length _ of the system ( see appendix [ app_lambda - d ] , [ app_clusterising ] for the behavior of @xmath66 in the models we analyzed ) ; the degeneracy in the entanglement spectrum , in contrast , is exhibited when the afore mentioned size is much larger than @xmath66 .",
    "clearly , this paves the way to experimental tests through local measures on spatial region of sizes made of few spins , with the assistance of the protocols to address the rnyi entropies provided recently@xcite .",
    "incidentally , we note that for the symmetric partition @xmath23 there is differential local convertibility , but this is a fine tuned effect that disappears if the two blocks have different size , see fig.[convert_cluster ] and fig.[conver_lambdad_symm ] . ultimately , the size and type of subsystems @xmath4 and @xmath5 on which the differential local convertibility is displayed depends on the recombination of the edge states that form at edges of the bipartition ( see @xcite for an extensive discussion of such edge state recombination phenomenon ) . with our results we can claim that the local convertibility can characterize the phase , independently of the way the system is partitioned .",
    "we believe that such a scenario provides a valuable assistance to standard routes in experimental solid state physics to disclose topological order in the system .",
    "our work opens several questions that will be subject of future investigation .",
