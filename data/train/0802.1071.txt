    "it is well established that ionization of pah molecules dramatically enhances the emission in the 6 - 9 region , suggesting that most of the observed ir emission arises from highly vibrationally excited cations .",
    "this excitation generally proceeds via the absorption of ultraviolet ( uv ) , visible ( vis ) , and near - ir ( nir ) radiation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while the early , low to moderate resolution spectroscopic observations suggested that the dominant pah features are invariant , analysis of higher resolution spectra of many objects revealed that the pah features vary between different classes of object and spatially within extended objects ( e.g. *",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , showing that the details in the emission spectrum depend on , and therefore reflect , the specific pah molecules present and the conditions within the emission zones .",
    "most previous work on the ir spectroscopic properties of pahs focused on species containing about 50 or fewer carbon atoms because large pahs are not readily available for experimental study and computational techniques for such large systems were not practical .",
    "while large pah accessibility remains limited , computational capabilities have increased and the spectra of large pahs can be determined with good precision . here",
    "we report and discuss the computational ir spectra of several large , compact , and symmetric pahs , namely , , , and .",
    "when combined with our previous work on the large pahs and @xcite , these spectra provide new insight into the effect of pah size and structure on their ir spectra .",
    "the ir spectra of comparably sized , but less compact and less symmetric , pahs are discussed in a subsequent paper ( bauschlicher et al . in preparation , paper ii ) .",
    "these two studies , together with the previous work on nitrogen substitution , substantially deepen our understanding of the pah populations that contribute to the astronomical spectra .",

    "the spectra for the neutral , cation and anion forms for all these pahs have been computed .",
    "the geometries are optimized and the harmonic frequencies and ir intensities are computed using the b3lyp @xcite hybrid @xcite functional in conjunction with the 4 - 31 g basis sets @xcite .",
    "the calculations are performed using the gaussian 03 computer codes @xcite .",
    "the number of bands determined for these large species is so great that we do not show all of the data here .",
    "these data are available upon request from the authors and will become part of the publicly available ames pah ir spectral database which is now under construction . to illustrate these results ,",
    "synthetic spectra are presented in which the computed frequencies have been scaled by 0.958 and the behavior of some of the more important band positions are discussed .",
    "the scaling factor of 0.958 has been found to bring the computationally determined pah vibrational frequencies into very good agreement with experimentally measured spectra @xcite .",
    "for example , most computational and experimental peak positions fall within 5 @xmath0 of each other , some within 10 @xmath0 , and a handful within 15 @xmath0 . the observed trends in peak position with size and between cations , anions and neutrals should be more accurate than this absolute uncertainty , hence the small shifts we report in this paper should be valid .",
    "the intensities are unscaled , despite the potential factor of 2 overestimation of the computed intensity for the ch stretching modes of the neutrals that has been discussed previously @xcite .",
    "to permit comparison of these absorption spectra with astronomical observations which are measured in emission , the natural mid - ir linewidth for a large molecule emitting under interstellar conditions has to be taken into account . up to now , this has been taken as about 30 @xmath0 across the mid - ir .",
    "as discussed in cami et al .",
    "( in preparation ) , the natural linewitdth can be band dependent . here a linewidth of 30 @xmath0 is taken for the bands shortward of 9 , 10 @xmath0 for the bands longward of 10 , values consistent with current observational and theoretical constraints .",
    "for the 9 to 10 region , the fwhm is scaled in a linear fashion ( in wavenumber space ) from 30 to 10 @xmath0 .",
    "in addition to ignoring any further variations of linewidth as a function of mode , fermi resonances are not taken into account . despite these limitations",

    "the peak positions of the bands which dominate the ch stretching region for each of the pahs considered here are listed in table [ t1 ] .",
    "the spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_33 ] .",
    "the peak wavelength for the neutrals is essentially independent of pah size and falls at @xmath153.26 .",
    "for both the cations and anions however , there is a small shift with increasing size . including coronene ( ) , the peak wavelength for the cations increases from 3.238 to 3.257 with size while that for the anions drops from 3.296 to 3.276 with pah size .    turning to band strengths ,",
    "table  [ t1 ] shows that the ch stretching ( ch@xmath16 ) band intensities increase with pah size for the neutrals , cations , and anions . while an increase in total band strength with size is to be expected because the number of ch bonds increase with pah size , the non - additive behavior of the increase is noteworthy . to illustrate this effect ,",
    "table  [ t1 ] also lists the integrated band strengths ( a values ) per ch for each pah .",
    "several important points become apparent from this tabulation .",
    "first , it is clear that the behavior of coronene is not at all typical for the larger pahs treated here .",
    "this is important because coronene has been considered archtypical of astronomical pahs , while significantly larger pahs dominate the cosmic mix .",
    "second , when one removes coronene from further consideration , pah ch@xmath16 intensity per ch steadily increases with pah size for both the cations and neutrals , but much less so for the anions .",
    "third , the ch@xmath16 intensity drop upon ionization is small for these large pahs .",
    "for example , the integrated intensity per ch for the ch@xmath16 in neutral is 41 km / mol and it is 27 km / mol for the cation form . in contrast , consider the a values for coronene in table  [ t1 ] .",
    "its a value is reduced from 24 km / mol to 5 km / mol , nearly a factor of 5 , upon ionization .",
    "significant ch@xmath16 a value reduction upon ionization is typical for all the small pahs considered to date ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus the dramatic reduction in the a value per ch for the ch@xmath16 upon ionization that is observed for small pahs disappears as pah size increases .",
    "this behavior is a consequence of spreading the positive ( or negative ) charge over more carbon atoms with increasing pah size , thereby reducing the difference in the ch stretching dipole derivative between the neutral , cation , and anion , and hence reducing the difference in the observed intensities of the ch stretching vibrations .",
    "the astronomical emission bands arising from the ch stretching vibrations were discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "these authors compared their astronomical data with experimental and theoretical spectra of over 100 small pahs ( @xmath22 c@xmath23 ) in their neutral and positively charged states , supplemented by the spectra of a few larger pahs , and 27 small pah anions .",
    "this analysis is extended here to include the impact of the spectrum of the larger pahs shown in fig .",
    "[ structure ] on the earlier conclusions .",
    "[ fig_average]a shows the feature produced by averaging the bands associated with each charge state previously presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_33 ] .",
    "this clearly demonstrates the shift in peak position as a function of pah charge .",
    "[ fig_chstr ] shows the 3.29 astronomical emission feature from ngc 7027 along with grey bars which represent the full range of pah ch stretching peak positions for the neutral , cationic , and anionic pahs in the sample described above .",
    "superposed on this figure is the range in peak positions for the very large compact pahs presented in table  [ t1 ] ( dark grey bar connecting filled diamonds ) . to facilitate the comparison between the spectra presented here and the astronomical spectra , all laboratory and theoretical spectra",
    "have been redshifted by 15 @xmath0 to take the redshift into account that is intrinsic to the emission process @xcite .",
    "the peak positions for compact , very large pahs fall within the regions spanned by the earlier sample , but span a much narrower range .",
    "consequently , the principle conclusion presented in @xcite for this feature , namely that its peak position is most consistent with an origin in neutral and negatively charged pahs , while clearly ruling out an origin in pah cations , remains unaltered .",
    "the proximity of the ranges in the ch@xmath16 peak position for the neutral and anion pah forms suggests that the two classes of astronomical 3.3 band designated as a@xmath24 and b@xmath24 by @xcite reflect the relative contributions of pah neutrals and anions .    the narrow range in ch stretch frequencies listed in table  [ t1 ] and illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_chstr ] , and the predominance of one feature in the ch stretching region are characteristics inherent in the spectroscopy of compact and largely symmetric pahs .",
    "such structures require that the molecules have similar edge structures .",
    "this , in turn , leads to similar spectra involving the ch modes as the local environment of each peripheral ch group is similar along the edge of the molecule within a given molecule and from one molecule to the next .",
    "the similarity between the absorption band of the ch stretch in the large compact pahs described here and the astronomical 3.29 feature suggests that compact and somewhat symmetric pah cations and anions dominate the pah mixture producing this astronomical feature .",

    "the bands in the 6 - 9 region of the spectra correspond to cc stretching and ch in - plane bending vibrations .",

    "this behavior is consistent with that found for all pahs studied to date , namely the bands in the 6 - 9 region undergo significant intensity enhancement upon pah ionization ( see table  [ t2 ] ) .",
    "since the 6 - 9 bands are rather weak for the neutrals , this discussion will focus on the cations and anions .",
    "consider first the pure cc stretching region ( @xmath156.2 to 6.5 ) in the spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_62 ] .",
    "the spectrum produced by cc stretching vibrations ( cc@xmath16 ) of the cations is slightly richer than that of the anions .",
    "nonetheless , the strongest band in this region falls between 6.267 and 6.443 in most cases ( this excludes which has two nearly equal peaks at 6.326 and 6.479 ) .",
    "the peak position of the cc@xmath16 features in the spectra of the anions also show less variation than the peak wavelength in the spectra of the cations and they are slightly weaker in both an absolute sense and relative to the bands between 7 and 9 .",
    "the anion band peak tends to fall at somewhat longer wavelengths than that of the cation , ranging from 6.326 to 6.423 .",
    "for the three largest pah cations , there is a second peak in the range 6.443 and at 6.498 and a third peak around @xmath15 6.7 . for @xmath17 ,",
    "the 6.443 component is stronger than the 6.297 component .",
    "there is some surprising variation in the intensity of the cation bands from one molecule to the next , and in this regard note that this band is rather weak for @xmath17 .",
    "there are a lot of modes in this spectral range and those with significant intensity derive that intensity from details of the molecular shape and the charge distributed throughout the molecule .",
    "consider next the bands produced by vibrations involving pah cc stretching and ch in - plane bending vibrations . these fall from about 7 to 9 in the spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_62 ] .",
    "the features in the 7 to 8 region are associated with vibrations in which cc stretching and ch in - plane bending motions are coupled , while those between 8 and 9 primarily arise from ch in - plane bending vibrations . the 7 to 9 spectra of the cations and anions resemble one another and , at first glance , the spectra of the three largest pahs appear similar . however , upon closer inspection important differences become evident .",
    "the following trends emerge when comparing the spectra .",
    "for the three largest pahs , the strongest feature near 7.7 ( the position of the strongest astronomcial feature ) falls between 7.732 and 7.822 for the cations and between 7.795 and 7.867 for the anions .",
    "this tendency for the cation bands to fall at slightly shorter wavelengths than for the anions holds for the smaller pahs considered here as well , although the spread is somewhat larger .    the variation in peak position of the strongest band near 7.7",
    "is less pronounced for the anions than for the cations , mostly because the bands in the small anions tend to fall at longer wavelengths than those in small cations .",
    "for example , for @xmath17 the band falls close to 7.67 , but for @xmath17 the maximum is closer to 7.56 . for the corresponding anions , the difference is less than 0.05 .",
    "the 7.7 band of the two smallest pah cations , @xmath17 , and @xmath17 is not very pronounced .",
    "however , further increasing the size leads to a shift toward @xmath157.8 for the three largest pah cations considered here .",
    "we turn now to the bands that arise primarily from ch in - plane bending vibrations , the features in the 8 to 9 region of the spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig_62 ] .",
    "overall , the spectral features of both the anions and cations in this region are rather similar .",
    "while there is slight variation in the position of these bands , there appears a general shift to longer wavelength with increasing size of the pah cation .",
    "there is a band in the 8.279 to 8.467 range for the three smallest pahs , but it is not very strong .",
    "however , as pah size increases , the intensity of this band increases significantly and it shifts to longer wavelength , producing the very prominent band that appears near 8.5 in the spectra of the 4 largest pahs for both the cations and anions .    for the molecules studied in this work ,",
    "there are many allowed modes throughout the spectra .",
    "it is therefore interesting to note that for some molecules , a few bands carry all the intensity in the 6 - 9 @xmath18 m region , while for others there are several bands with significant intensity .",
    "this is very different from the c - h stretching region where the band position varies little for the molecules studied here .",
    "thus , the 6 - 9 region of the spectra may yield some insight into the character of the molecules present in the astrophysical environment . with this in mind",
    ", we have viewed the modes that compose the bands that carry significant intensity , for both the molecules in this work and the lower symmetry species presented in paper ii .",

    "this duo band impacts the interpretation of the astronomical pah emission spectrum in two ways .",
    "first , the number of trio hydrogens deduced with respect to solo and duo hydrogens on the emitting astronomical pah population must be reduced .",
    "the spectra shown in figures [ fig_oops ] and [ fig_average]c suggest that an important fraction of the intensity of the 12.8 astronomical feature can arise from the ch@xmath19 bending vibrations from duo h s . for ngc  7027",
    ", this may be as high as 50% .",
    "this , in turn , implies that the structures @xcite deduced as being most important in these objects and others with spectra between 9 - 15 which show clear evidence for the 12 duo h band should be modified to more compact and symmetric forms similar to those shown in figure 1 here .",
    "second , this overlap between the duo and trio bands in neutral pahs may resolve a longstanding puzzle regarding the origin of the blue shading on the 12.8 astronomical feature .",
    "the lower frame in figure [ fig_oops ] shows that the ch@xmath19 trio ch bands for small neutral pahs fall in a narrow band , from 13.0 to 13.5 while the ch@xmath19 duo bands for the neutral pahs considered here range from 12.5 to 13.2 .",
    "figure [ fig_average]c shows this holds for the charged forms of these pahs as well . overlap between this duo band with the trio feature could produce the observed , blue - shaded profile .",
    "keep in mind that this study involves only compact , symmetric pahs that contain only solo and duo hydrogens and that using lower symmetry species will allow more types of hydrogens leading to additional couplings .",
    "these results suggest that caution is warranted when constraining the number and nature of adjacent hydrogens and implied structures using the out - of - plane bending modes alone .",
    "this issue is considered further in paper ii which treats the spectra of less symmetric and less compact very large pahs .",
    "the mid - ir spectroscopic properties of the large pahs presented above will now be compared with observations .",
    "the discussion parallels the order in sect .  [ lab ] .                ) with the peak positions of the ch stretch in various pahs .",
    "the striped , narrow grey feature in the spectrum of ngc7027 is the pf@xmath20 line .",
    "the pah data are redshifted by 15 @xmath0 , a shift which is intrinsic to the emission process ( see text for details ) .",
    "the connected , filled diamonds indicate the range of the ch stretch in the large pahs considered here .",
    "the shaded horizontal bars indicate the full range of the pah ch stretching modes for the smaller pah sample described in the text ( sect .",
    "[ astro_33 ] ) .",
    "the symbols crossed by short horizontal lines represent the average wavelength and standard deviation for that bar .",

    "previous to this study , the mid - ir spectroscopic properties of pahs was essentially limited to species containing about 50 or fewer carbon atoms .",
    "these data provide new insight into the effect of size , structure and charge on pah ir spectra and enhances our understanding of the pah populations that contribute to the observed astronomical spectra .",
    "the main conclusions regarding the principle astronomical emission features follow .    _ the 3.29 feature : _ the strongest feature in the ch stretching region near 3.3 is similar for all pah species considered in this work .",
    "the peak position of this band in these compact , very large pahs falls within the regions expected based on the spectroscopy of smaller pahs , but covers a narrower range . while clearly ruling out an origin in pah cations , these spectra suggest that the astronomical a@xmath24 and b@xmath24 bands reflect the relative contribution of pah neutrals and anions .    _",
    "the 5 - 9 features : _ consistent with earlier work on smaller pahs , the intensities of the major features between 5 and 9 in these larger pahs are enhanced by an order of magnitude or more upon ionization .    the dominant bands in the cc stretching region between 6.1 and 6.4 show less variation in the spectra of the anions than in the spectra of the cations and they are slightly weaker relative to the bands between 7 and 9 .",
    "the average band in the cation and anion spectra peaks slightly redward of 6.3 , far to the red of the astronomical 6.2 band . thus , as with small pahs , the cc stretch in large pahs comprised of only c and h can not reproduce the peak position of the astronomical feature , reinforcing our previous suggestion that astronomical pahs contain nitrogen ( panhs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the largest pah cations and anions considered have strong bands close to 7.7 , the position of the strongest astronomical emission feature .",
    "the strong feature produced by the cations and anions overlap to a large extent , but the average anion peak falls about 0.1 to the red of the average cation peak .",
    "these data suggest that the astronomical 7.7 band is produced by overlapping bands from a mixture of small and large pah cations and anions , with small pahs contributing more to the 7.6 component and large pahs more to the 7.8 component .",
    "this implies that the variation in the peak position of the 7.8 feature may be related to the variation in relative amounts of large pah cations and anions since negatively charged large pahs emit at slightly longer wavelenths than do the pah cations .    a band near 8.5 grows in strength and shifts slightly to the red as pah size increases for both anions and cations .",
    "the bands from both the large pah anions and cations overlap , with the anions contributing more strongly at slightly longer wavelengths .",
    "@xcite found a correlation between the peak position of the astronomical 7.7 feature and that of the 8.6 band .",
    "the inability of small pahs to reproduce this correlation suggests that the astronomical 7.8 component and the 8.6 feature originate primarily in large , cationic and anionic pahs , with the specific peak position and profile reflecting the particular cation to anion concentration ratio in any given object .    _",
    "the 10 - 15 features : _ the prominent features that span this region correspond to ch@xmath19 bending vibrations .",
    "the large pahs in this sample contain only solo and duo hydrogens . the solo modes for these large , compact , symmetric pahs fall in the wavelength range expected for the solo ch@xmath19 bend",
    "however , this is nt the case for the duo ch@xmath19 modes . the duo and solo ch@xmath19 vibrations couple in these large , compact pahs , causing a splitting of the duo band .",
    "one component remains close to the traditional duo band position while the other shifts to about 13 , the region traditionally assigned to trio bands .",
    "the excellent agreement between the strong 11.2 astronomical feature and the average of the computed spectra for neutral pahs presented here lends strong support to its assignment to large , neutral astronomical pahs .",
    "however , the previously unrecognized component of the duo modes near @xmath1512.8 overlaps the astronomical emission feature at 12.8 which is normally attributed to trio ch@xmath19 modes .",
    "this overlap impacts the interpretation of the astronomical pah emission spectrum in two ways .",
    "the number of trio hydrogens deduced with respect to solo and duo hydrogens on the emitting astronomical pah population must be reduced , in some cases , by as much as a factor of two , implying that the pah structures @xcite previously deduced should be modified to favor more compact and symmetric forms .",
    "second , the overlap between the duo and trio bands in neutral pahs may produce the puzzling , blue - shaded profile of the 12.8 feature that is commonly observed .                                                                          ,",
