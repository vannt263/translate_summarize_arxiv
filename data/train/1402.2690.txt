    "for compressible flow problems in computational fluid dynamics ( cfd ) , the physical features such as shock waves and/or contact discontinuities , across which the fluid density , velocity and/or pressure vary abruptly , often appear in the solution .",
    "they are usually referred as riemann problems ( named after bernhard riemann ) in mathematics @xcite .",
    "based on the characteristics analysis , the exact solutions can be obtained through iterations and they perform well for simple problems @xcite . however , exact riemann solvers are computational expensive for two- and three - dimensional problems , for which thousands or millions of mesh elements are used to discretise the whole flow domain @xcite .",
    "therefore , great efforts have been made in the past several decades to develop the efficient approximate riemann solvers .",
    "for this purpose , harten , lax and van leer proposed the hll riemann solver with a two - wave model resolving three constant states @xcite . to restore the intermediate wave missing from the hll solver , toro et al .",
    "@xcite proposed the hllc riemann solver composing a three - wave model to separate four averaged states .",
    "consequently the contact discontinuity was identified by the hllc solver @xcite .",
    "batten et al .",
    "further modified the wavespeeds estimate of the scheme , assuming the intermediate wave speed equals to the average normal velocity between the intermediate left and right acoustic waves @xcite .",
    "the hllc scheme is a versatile approximate riemann solver and it has attractive features including exact resolution of isolated contact and shock waves , positivity preservation and enforcement of entropy condition @xcite .",
    "it is now one of the most popular approximate riemann solvers used by the researchers investigating compressible flow problems with mesh methods @xcite .",
    "these facts trigger off our intention to extend the hllc scheme from mesh methods to meshless methods .",
    "meshless methods are relatively new and currently they are not as mature as mesh based methods including finite difference , finite element and finite volume . since the important work of batina in meshless methods for computational gas dynamics @xcite , many studies have been accomplished to explore the advantages of these methods for simulating external aerodynamics problems using the jst ( jameson - schmidt - turkey ) scheme or upwind schemes @xcite .",
    "some concerns were raised by researchers regarding the efficiency of meshless methods , because these kinds of methods are usually not faster or even slower than mesh methods on a per - point basis as indicated by batina@xcite .",
    "while this topic is beyond the scope of the current work , readers may refer to the following important works using implicit method @xcite , adaptive method @xcite , hybrid method @xcite and multi - level cloud method @xcite , which have been accomplished to address this issue .",
    "it was noticed by the current authors that the hllc scheme was claimed to be used in meshless methods for gas dynamics problems @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it was not clearly stated whether the flux terms were computed in a dimensional split or non - split manner , and the wavespeeds estimate for the hllc scheme was not clarified .",
    "after a relatively thorough investigation of the above - mentioned works for meshless methods , it is interesting to discover that these researcheres mainly focused on the compressible gas flows and only the perfect gas equation of state ( pg - eos ) was adopted to correlate the state variables ( density , pressure and temperature / energy ) . consequently , it is a little difficult to foresee whether they will extend the meshless methods to the simulation of compressible liquids for high pressure and/or high speed flow problems in hydrodynamics .",
    "the objective of the present work is to conduct a comprehensive study of the hllc approximate riemann solver within the framework of least - square meshless method ( lsmm ) for compressible flows . a dimensional non - split meshless hllc riemann solver is presented with specific implementation details in this paper . a corresponding step - by - step instructive computing algorithm , which is easy to follow ,",
    "is also provided in the paper .",
    "the main work concentrates on the compressible gas flows , which are very important for computational aerodynamics . referring the liquid flows in hydrodynamics ,",
    "they are generally considered to be incompressible due to their small density variations . however , for high pressure and/or high speed problems , simply assuming the liquids as incompressible will encounter difficulties in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "therefore , a tentative study of the compressible liquid flow problems with the meshless hllc solver is also presented to gauge the capability of the method .",
    "considering the fact that the pg - eos may be not very suitable for liquids to correlate the state variables , the stiffened gas equation of state ( sg - eos ) is adopted in the present work .",
    "this enables the presented method to effectively handle the gases and liquids with the appropriate polytropic constants and pressure constants . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the implementation of the hllc solver for the sg - eos in meshless methods has not been reported in the literature .",

    "<S> the hllc riemann solver , which resolves both the shock waves and contact discontinuities , is popular to the computational fluid dynamics community studying compressible flow problems with mesh methods . </S>",

    "<S> the capability of the meshless hllc solver to deal with compressible liquid flows is not completely clear yet as very few related studies have been reported . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a comprehensive investigation of a dimensional non - split hllc riemann solver for the least - square meshless method is carried out in this study . </S>",
    "<S> the stiffened gas equation of state is adopted to capacitate the proposed method to deal with single - phase gases and/or liquids effectively , whilst direct applying the perfect gas equation of state for compressible liquid flows might encounter great difficulties in correlating the state variables . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial derivatives of the euler equations are computed by a least - square approximation and the flux terms are calculated by the hllc scheme in a dimensional non - split pattern . </S>",
    "<S> simulations of gas and liquid shock tubes , moving shock passing a cylinder , internal supersonic flows in channels and external transonic flows over aerofoils are accomplished . </S>",
    "<S> the current approach is verified by extensive comparisons of the produced numerical outcomes with various available data such as the exact solutions , finite volume mesh method results , experimental measurements or other reference results .    </S>",
