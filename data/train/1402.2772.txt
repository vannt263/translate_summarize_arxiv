    "search processes occur on many different scales , ranging from the passive diffusive search of regulatory proteins for their specific binding site in living biological cells @xcite over the search of animals for food @xcite or of computer algorithms for minima in a complex search space @xcite . here",
    "we are interested in random , jump - like search processes .",
    "the searcher , that is , has no prior information on the location of its target and performs a random walk until encounter with the target . during a relocation along its trajectory ( a jump ) , the walker is insensitive to the target . in the words of movement ecology occupied with the movement patterns of animals ,",
    "this process is called _ blind search _ with _ saltatory motion_. it is typical for predators hunting at spatial scales exceeding their sensory range @xcite .",
    "for instance , blind search is observed for plankton - feeding basking sharks @xcite , jellyfish predators and leatherback turtles @xcite , and southern elephant seals @xcite .",
    "saltatory search is distinguished from _ cruise search _",
    ", when the searcher continues to explore its environment during relocations .",
    "the first studies on random search considered the brownian motion of the searcher as a default strategy , until shlesinger and klafter proposed that lvy flights ( lfs ) are much more efficient in the search for sufficiently sparse targets @xcite . in a markovian lf the individual displacement lengths @xmath3 of the walker",
    "are power - law distributed , @xmath4 , where due to @xmath5 the second moment of the jump lengths diverges , @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this lack of a length scale @xmath7 effects a fractal dimension of the trajectory @xcite , such that local search is interspersed by long , decorrelating excursions .",
    "this strategy avoids oversampling , the frequent return to previously visited points in space of recurrent random walk processes , such as brownian motion in one and two dimensions @xcite .",
    "the latter are indeed the relevant cases for land - based searchers . even for airborne or marine searchers ,",
    "the vertical span of their trajectories is usually much smaller than the horizontal span , rendering their motion almost fully two dimensional .",
    "the outstanding role of lfs for random search processes in one and two dimensions was formulated in the _ lf hypothesis : superdiffusive motion governed by fat - tailed propagators optimize encounter rates under specific ( but common ) circumstances : hence some species must have evolved mechanisms that exploit these properties @xmath8 $ ] _ @xcite .",
    "starting with the report of lf - search by albatross birds @xcite there was a surge of discoveries of such scale - free search strategies , _",
    "inter alia _ , for marine predators @xcite , insects such as moths @xcite , land - based mammals such as deer and goats @xcite , as well as microorganisms such as dinoflagellates @xcite . in some cases",
    "these reports were debated .",
    "for instance , an additional investigation showed that spider monkeys indeed move deterministically @xcite and mussels have multimodal rather than power - law relocations @xcite .",
    "similarly , plant lice exhibit lvy motion on the population level but not for the motion of individuals @xcite .",
    "in particular , the disqualification of the lf statistics for albatrosses @xcite became a strong argument against the lf hypothesis .",
    "however , there is strong evidence that for individual albatross birds lfs are indeed a real search pattern @xcite .    from extensive studies of human trajectories",
    "it was shown that lf motion patterns are indeed characteristic @xcite , although in some cases correlations in the motion exist @xcite .",
    "similarly the paths of fishing boats follow lf statistics @xcite , although this observation has also been put in question @xcite .",
    "interesting findings were reported from robotics , where one of the important questions is how robots should search for hidden targets . from simulations",
    "it was concluded that the most successful robots performed motion consistent with lf foraging @xcite .",
    "a number of other search strategies was proposed as an alternative to lfs .",
    "these include intermittent dynamics switching between local diffusive search and ballistic relocations @xcite , which may also be of power - law form @xcite .",
    "moreover , searchers may perform persistent random walks with finite tangential correlations @xcite .",
    "however , while the difference in performance between models with a scale and lfs may be small , the central advantage of the lf strategy is its robustness : while other models work best when their parameters are optimized for specific environmental conditions such as the target density lfs remain close to optimal even when these conditions are altered @xcite .",
    "lfs have thus been promoted as a preferred strategy when there is insufficient prior knowledge on the search space . in particular , for sufficiently sparse targets several analyses claim that the optimal value for the power - law exponent is @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "following the continuing debate over the validity of the lf hypothesis we here extend our recent study in ref .",
    "@xcite and scrutinize the lf hypothesis from a different angle .",
    "namely , we analyze the performance of the lf search mechanism in the presence of an external bias .",
    "such a bias could , for instance , correspond to an underwater current biasing the search motion of marine predators or search robots , or to an airflow driving birds of prey in a preferential direction .",
    "it could be a bias in an abstract landscape searched by a computed algorithm .",
    "finally , it could also simply be the personal bias of the searcher based on some prior experience .",
    "such biases are commonplace and their effect needs to be considered in models for random search processes .",
    "it turns out that an external bias may have profound consequences for the efficiency of lf search .",
    "thus , even in the presence of a small bias lf search may fare worse than brownian search . depending on the initial separation between searcher and target and on whether from the perspective of the searcher",
    "the bias is directed towards or away from the target , we find that the optimal power - law exponent @xmath1 may range in the entire interval from one to 2 , and explicitly include brownian motion . without prior knowledge ,",
    "it may turn out that brownian search is indeed the more efficient search method .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we set up our model in terms of the fractional fokker - planck equation . in sec .",
    "we explicitly calculate the first arrival density and the search efficiency in absence of a bias .",
    "in particular , we obtain the optimal search parameters as function of the initial distance between searcher and target . in sec .",
    "iv we generalize these findings to the case when an external bias is present .",
    "we analyze the temporal decay of the first arrival density and introduce a generalized pclet number .",

    "v. in the appendix , we detail several calculations .",

    "a random walker moves by random jumps , whose lengths are chosen according to the power - law distribution @xmath10 with @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the fourier transform of @xmath10 .",
    "its stretched gaussian form in @xmath13 space defines a symmetric lvy stable distribution , with the long - tailed asymptotic form @xmath14 for @xmath5 .",
    "consequently the variance of @xmath10 diverges , @xmath15 , while fractional moments @xmath16 of order @xmath17 are finite @xcite .",
    "in addition to such lvy stable jump lengths we consider an external drift . this _ bias _ is called uphill ( or downhill ) when the bias is directed against ( along ) the walker with respect to the original walker - target location .",
    "a searcher finds the target when after a jump its position coincides with the location of the target .",
    "that is , the successful search corresponds to the first arrival at the target coordinate",
    ". this process will be substantially different from that of brownian search , and consists of a tradeoff between two effects : ( i ) due to the scale - free jump length distribution ( [ jld ] ) the above - mentioned oversampling is diminished , and less points are revisited multiply before eventual location of the target .",
    "( ii ) due to the existence of extremely long jumps the walker may severely overshoot the target , producing so - called leapovers ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the length of these leapovers is distributed as @xmath18 , and is thus wider than the original jump length distribution ( [ jld ] ) @xcite .",
    "this property renders the first arrival of an lf different from the process of first passage , and the first arrival efficiency worsens with decreasing @xmath1 @xcite .",

    "a brownian walker always explores the space continuously and therefore localizes any point on the line .",

    "thus , even for the brownian downhill case the simulated value of probability to eventually find the target becomes less than 1 .",
    "this effect needs to be remedied by the appropriate choice of a finite target size .",
    "the tradeoff is now that the target needs to be sufficiently large to avoid the overshoot by the searcher . at the same time",

    "however , in contrast to the situation with a fixed target density , @xmath75 diverges for simple brownian search on a line without bias @xcite .    for this reason we propose a different measure for the search efficiency , namely @xmath78 instead of the average search time",
    ", we average over the inverse search time .",
    "this can be shown to be a useful measure for situations when @xmath75 is both finite or diverging . using the relation @xmath79 it is straightforward to show that @xmath80    as an example , consider the efficiency @xmath81 of a brownian walker without bias . with eq .",

    "we generalized the prominent lvy flight model for the random search of a target to the case of an external bias .",

    "the brownian searcher is more efficient , as it can not overshoot the target . with increasing @xmath30",

    "there is a strong asymmetry depending on the direction of the bias with respect to the initial location of the searcher and the target . for the downhill scenario the brownian searcher always fares better , as it is advected straight to the target while the lf searcher may dramatically overshoot the target in a leapover event and then needs to makes its way back to the target , against the bias .",
    "the observed behaviors can be non - monotonic , leading to an optimal value for the power - law exponent @xmath1 . for strong uphill bias and large initial separation",
    "the optimal @xmath1 value is unity , for short separations and downhill scenarios the brownian limit @xmath58 is best .",
    "there exist optimal values for @xmath1 in the entire interval @xmath2 , depending on the exact parameters .",
    "the search reliability for a given value of @xmath1 solely depends on the generalized pclet number . for unbiased search",
    "the searcher will always eventually locate the target , that is , the search efficiency attains the value of unity . in the presence of a bias , unity is returned for the search reliability for a brownian searcher in the downhill case .",
    "it decays exponentially for the uphill case . for lf searchers with @xmath1 smaller than two",
    ", the probability of leapovers reduces the value of the search reliability in the downhill case . in the opposite , uphill scenario",
    "the search reliability is larger for lf searchers compared to the brownian searcher .",
    "the absolute gain in this case , however , was found to be smaller than the loss to a brownian competitor in the downhill case . without prior knowledge of the bias",
    "a brownian search strategy may turn out to be overall advantageous .",
    "we also found a non - monotonicity of the search reliability as function of the initial searcher - target separation @xmath30 .",
    "it will be interesting to see whether our results for both the search efficiency and reliability under an external bias turn out similarly for periodic boundary conditions relevant for finite target densities .",
    "we note here that we analyzed lf search in one spatial dimension . what would be expected if the search space has more dimensions ? for regular brownian motion we know that it remains recurrent in two dimensions , that is , the sample path is space - filling in both one and two dimensions . on the other hand lfs with @xmath157",
    "are recurrent in one dimension but always transient in two dimensions .",
    "hence in two dimensions lfs will even more significantly reduce the oversampling of a brownian searcher . at the same time , however , the search reliability will go to zero . in both one and two dimensions ( linearly or radially )",
    "lfs are distinct due to the possibility of leapovers , owing to which the target localization may become less efficient than for brownian search .",
    "many search processes indeed fall in the category of ( effectively ) one or two dimensions .",
    "for example , they are one - dimensional in streams , along coastlines , or at forest - meadow and other borders . for ( relatively ) unbounded search processes as performed by birds or fish , the motion in the vertical dimension shows a much smaller span than the radial horizontal motion , and thus becomes effectively two dimensional .",
    "if we modify the condition of blind search and allow the walker to look out for prey while relocating , in one dimension this would obviously completely change the picture in favor of lfs with their long unidirectional steps .",
    "however , in two dimensions the radial leapovers would still impede the detection of the target unless it is exactly crossed during a step .",
    "so what remains of the lf hypothesis ?",
    "conceptually , it is certainly a beautiful idea : a scale - free process reduces oversampling and thus scans a larger domain .",
    "if the target has an extended width , for instance , a large school instead of a single fish , lfs will then optimize the search under certain criteria .",
    "however , even when the stable index is larger than unity , in two or three dimensions an lf may also never reach the target , due to its patchy albeit scale - free exploration of the search space .",
    "thus , even under lf - friendly conditions such as extremely sparse targets and/or uphill search , the superiority of lfs over other search models depends on the exact scenario .",
    "for instance , whether it is important that the target is eventually located with certainty , or whether in an ensemble of equivalent systems only sufficiently many members need a quick target localization , for instance , the triggering of some gene expression process responding to a lethal external signal in the cells of a biofilm .",
    "the lf hypothesis even in the case of blind search without any prior knowledge is therefore not universal , and depending on the conditions of initial searcher target separation or the direction of a naturally existing gradient with respect to the location of the target the regular brownian motion may be the best search strategy .",
    "lfs are most efficient under the worst case conditions of blind search for extremely sparse targets and , as shown here , for uphill motion . while very rare targets certainly exist in many scenarios",
    ", we should qualify the result for the uphill motion .",
    "the above uphill lf scenario holds for abstract processes such as the blind search of computer algorithms in complex landscapes or for the topology - mediated lfs in models of gene regulation . for the search of animals moving against a physical air or water stream ,",
    "however , we have to take into consideration that any motion against a gradient requires a higher energy expenditure .",
    "unless the gradient is very gentle , this aspect relativizes the lf hypothesis further .",
    "having said all this , one distinct advantage of spatially scale free search processes remains .",
    "namely , they are more tolerant to gradually shifting environmental conditions , for instance , a change in the target distribution , or when the searcher is exposed to a new patch with conditions unknown to him . this point is often neglected in the analysis of search processes .",
    "a more careful study of this point may in fact turn back the wheel in favor of lf search .",
    "it should be noted that lfs are processes with a diverging variance @xmath158 , and may therefore be considered unphysical .",
    "there exists the closely related superdiffusive model of lvy walks , they have a finite variance due to a spatiotemporal coupling introducing a finite travel velocity , compare , for instance , ref .",
    "this coupling penalizes long jumps .",
    "however , both models converge in the sense that the probability density function of a lvy walker displays a growing lvy stable portion in its center , limited by propagating fronts .",
    "the trajectory of such a lvy walk appears increasingly similar to an lf : local search interspersed by decorrelating long excursions .",
    "we expect that at least qualitatively our present findings remain valid for the case of lvy walks",
