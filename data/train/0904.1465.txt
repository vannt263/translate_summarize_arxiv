    "the direct observation of gravitational waves is a significant attempt in theoretical and experimental physics . in order to accomplish this great purpose , several ground - based laser interferometric detectors with kilometer - size arm , such as ligo , tama300 , geo600 , and virgo , are currently operating and the next - generation detectors are also on the menu @xcite .",
    "in addition to the ground - based detectors , the projects to launch a detector in space , such as lisa @xcite and decigo @xcite , are in progress .",
    "the importance to detect gravitational waves directly is that one can obtain a new method to see the universe by gravitational waves , which is called  gravitational - wave astronomy \" .",
    "in fact , by using the gravitational waves associated with the oscillations of compact object , it is possible to determine the stellar radius , mass , equation of state ( eos ) , and so on @xcite . additionally , with collecting the observational data of gravitational waves , we may able to verify the gravitational theory , and new physics at a high density or high energy region .    for both ground - based and space detectors ,",
    "the nonspherical stellar collapse is one of the most promising sources of gravitational waves . with their sensitivity ,",
    "the black hole formation with stellar mass is a target for the ground - based detectors , while the space detectors might detect signals radiated from the creation of supermassive black holes @xcite .",
    "the most hopeful approach to calculate these gravitational waves emitted during the black hole formation , is the numerical relativity , i.e. , via direct numerical integration of the exact einstein and hydrodynamic equations , which are full - nonlinearly coupled with each other . in the last decade , the numerical relativity made dramatic developments and it becomes possible to treat many complicated matter and spacetime @xcite .",
    "still , the computation of gravitational waves with high accuracy is not technically easy , because the gravitational waves emitted from the stellar collapse are very weak and sometimes they could contain unphysical noises due to gauge modes and/or numerical error .",
    "so in this paper , as an alternative approach , we consider the linear perturbation theory .",
    "this is possible to extract the weak gravitational waves with precision and also becomes a cross - check for the numerical results with numerical relativity .    with respect to the calculation of gravitational waves radiated from the stellar collapse to the black hole , initially , cunningham , price and moncrief derived the perturbation equations on the oppenheimer - snyder solution , which describes a homogeneous dust collapse @xcite , and",
    "calculated radiated gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "subsequently , seidel and co - workers studied the gravitational waves emitted from the stellar collapse when a neutron star would be born @xcite , where they used the gauge - invariant perturbation formalism on the spherically symmetric spacetime formulated by gerlach and sengupta @xcite .",
    "iguchi , nakao and harada investigated nonspherical perturbations of a collapsing inhomogeneous dust ball @xcite , which is described by the lematre - tolman - bondi solution @xcite .",
    "further , harada , iguchi and shibata calculated the axial gravitational waves emitted from the collapse of a supermassive star to a black hole by employing the covariant gauge - invariant formalism on the spherically symmetric spacetime and the coordinate - independent matching conditions at stellar surface , which is devised by gundlach and martn - garca @xcite . recently , with the same formalism , sotani , yoshida and kokkotas considered the magnetic effect on the axial gravitational waves emitted from the collapse of homogeneous dust sphere @xcite ( hereafter , we refer to this article as paper i ) .    in spite of many investigations of gravitational radiation from the stellar collapse with linear perturbation analysis",
    "as mentioned the above , they have not included the effect of the magnetic fields on the emitted gravitational waves , except for paper i. it should notice that cunningham , price and moncrief also dealt with the electromagnetic perturbations on the oppenheimer - snyder solution , but they did not consider the direct coupling between fluid and magnetic field @xcite . while , the importance of magnetic effects on the evolution of compact objects has been recently realized due to the appearance of new instruments with high performance .",
    "one of the most remarkable examples is the discovery of magnetars , which are neutron stars with strong magnetic field such as @xmath0 gauss . with magnetar models",
    ", it is successful to explain the observed specific frequencies of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) in the decaying tail of the giant flares @xcite .",
    "since there exists a quite strong magnetic field in some neutron stars , which would be produced after the stellar collapse , it is natural to take into account its effect on stellar collapse . and",
    "it could be also probable that the magnetic fields of the collapsing object are amplified during the collapse due to the magnetic flux conservation and they would affect the emitted gravitational waves , even if the initial magnetic field is weak .",
    "actually , paper i shows the possibility that the magnetic fields affect on the axial gravitational waves emitted during the dust collapse .",
    "additionally , there exists another example showing the importance of magnetic effects in the evolution of compact objects , which is related to gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) , i.e. , the short - duration grbs could arise from hypergiant flares of magnetars associated with the soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) @xcite or collapse of magnetized hypermassive neutron star @xcite .",
    "indeed , all examples mentioned above suggest that the magnetic fields play an important role in the stellar collapse and its effect should not be negligible .",
    "so in this paper , in order to explore the effects of magnetic fields on the emitted gravitational waves for the black hole formation , we consider the polar gravitational waves radiated during the collapse of homogeneous dust ball with weak magnetic field . in particular , along with paper i",
    ", we focus on the only quadrupole gravitation waves , which could be more important in the astrophysical point of view . the weak magnetic fields are treated as small perturbations on the oppenheimer - snyder solution and we make an investigation with the covariant gauge - invariant formalism on the spherically symmetric spacetime and the coordinate - independent matching conditions at stellar surface proposed by gundlach and martn - garca @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that so far there is no calculation of polar gravitational waves on the dynamical background spacetime with the same method , i.e. , this paper is first calculation .",
    "the reason why the polar gravitational waves could not be solved , might be the difficulty to deal with the boundary conditions at the stellar surface due to the existence of many perturbative variables , in contrast to the axial gravitational waves .",
    "furthermore , as shown in the main text for ordering of perturbations , we consider the first order perturbations for the metric and fluid motion while the second order perturbations for magnetic fields , to see the magnetic effects on the emitted gravitational waves .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ii ] we briefly describe the gauge - invariant perturbation theory on the spherical symmetric background , the background solution that we adopt in this paper , and how to introduce the magnetic fields as the perturbations .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ sec : iii ] , we derive the perturbation equations for polar gravitational waves emitted during the collapse of magnetized dust sphere .",
    "then the details of numerical procedure are shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : iv ] , and we devote sec . [",
    "sec : v ] to description of the code tests . in sec .",
    "[ sec : vi ] , we show the numerical results related to the influence of existence of magnetic fields on the gravitational waves radiated during the formation of black hole . finally we make a conclusion in sec .",
    "[ sec : vii ] . in this paper",
    ", we adopt the unit of @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote the speed of light and the gravitational constant , respectively , and the metric signature is @xmath4 .",
    "as with paper i , we deal with the electromagnetic fields as the small perturbations on the dust sphere , since the magnetic energy is much smaller that the gravitational binding energy even if the source of gravitational waves would involve a strong magnetic field like a magnetar .",
    "thus the background metric @xmath5 and four - velocity of fluid @xmath6 are determined as solutions of a collapsing spherical dust sphere without the electromagnetic fields .",
    "now it is convenient to introduce two small dimensionless parameters related to strength of the magnetic field and to amplitude of the gravitational waves , i.e. , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is stellar radius and we assume that the fluid perturbations are also small , i.e. , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "then the leading terms for the perturbations of @xmath12 and @xmath13 are @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 express the energy - momentum tensors for the fluid and for the electromagnetic fields , respectively . in this paper since we focus on the effect of magnetic field upon the emitted gravitational waves during the stellar collapse , we omit terms of higher order such as @xmath16 and @xmath17 . further with assumption that @xmath18 , the perturbed einstein equations of order @xmath19 are reduced to the following form @xmath20 notice in this approximation the gravitational perturbations are driven both by the magnetic field and the fluid motions of the collapsing dust sphere .      for spherically symmetric background spacetime ,",
    "the first order gauge - invariant perturbation theory has been formulated by gerlach and sengupta @xcite and further developed by gundlach and martn - garca @xcite . in this subsection",
    "we briefly describe this formalism for the polar parity perturbations .",
    "the background spacetime , which is a spherically symmetric four dimensional spacetime @xmath21 , can be described as a product of the form @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a 2-dimensional ( 1 + 1 ) reduced spacetime and @xmath24 a 2-dimensional spheres . in other words ,",

    "i , to avoid numerical instabilities we integrate the wave equations by using a first order finite difference scheme , while in regions ii and iii the numerical integration is a second order finite difference scheme . in region",
    "i we adopt the equally spaced grids for @xmath162 , i.e. , @xmath194 and @xmath195 are constant , and we set to be @xmath196 . with this assumption ,",

    "the grid points in region ii are determined so that at the stellar surface they agree with the grid points produced with the coordinates in region i. that is , @xmath200 and @xmath201 are not constant and @xmath202 in region ii .",
    "it is noted that with initial data sets on @xmath203 in region i and on @xmath204 in region ii , the evolutions in regions i and ii can be calculated , independently of the information in region iii . after the calculation of the evolutions in regions",
    "i and ii , with the data set on the null hypersurface , @xmath191 , and initial data set on @xmath204 the evolution in region iii can be calculated , where we adopt the equally spaced grids for @xmath193 . as mentioned before ,",
    "hereafter we focus only on the quadrupole gravitational waves ( @xmath142 ) , which are coupled with the dipole magnetic fields ( @xmath205 ) .",
    "finally it should note that in region iii we calculate the time evolution for only variable @xmath179 , which is subject to the zerilli equation ( [ exterior_gw ] ) , while in region ii , to make it easy to deal with the junction conditions on the stellar surface , we also calculate the time evolutions for the variable @xmath172 as well as @xmath179 .",
    "the perturbation equation for @xmath172 is derived from the equation ( [ perturbation-01 ] ) , which is described with null coordinates as @xmath206 in the rest of this section , we describe the initial data , the boundary conditions at the stellar center and at the spatial infinity , and the special treatment of the junction condition as the stellar surface approaches the event horizon .     or @xmath207 , is the boundary between regions i and ii , and the shaded region corresponds to the stationary region outside star . , height=264 ]      to start numerical simulations , we need to provide a data set on the initial hypersurface for the quantities @xmath159 , @xmath208 , and @xmath209 as well as the magnetic perturbations of @xmath129 and @xmath130 for the interior region , while @xmath179 , @xmath210 , and @xmath211 for the exterior region . outside the star ,",
    "we assume that the initial perturbations are `` momentarily static '' , which is similar initial condition in @xcite . with this assumption the initial distribution of @xmath212",
    "is determined by using the following equation ;",
    "@xmath213 with the boundary condition at infinity as @xmath214 where @xmath215 is a constant denoted the quadrupole moment of the star . similar to @xcite , we assume that @xmath216 . since this solution is a static , the initial perturbation outside the star , @xmath217 , does not evolve until a light signal from the stellar interior arrives there , i.e. , on the gray region in fig .",

    "( [ maxwell1 - 0 in ] )  ( [ maxwell1 - 2 in ] ) .",
    "as mentioned before , since in this paper we focus only on the case that the magnetic fields are confined inside the star , we should put the boundary conditions at @xmath207 , such as @xmath131 . then ,",
    "similar to the exterior region , if the momentarily static condition for @xmath159 would be assumed , with the given initial distributions for magnetic fields , the initial data for @xmath159 can be determined by integrating the equation of @xmath225 it should notice that for the case of the non - magnetized sphere the value of @xmath226 at the stellar surface is independent from the central value of @xmath159 , because the equation ( [ initial - zeta ] ) does not have the source term . thus in this case we produce the initial data of @xmath159 so that at the stellar surface the metric perturbation is not smooth but just continuous .",
    "however , the effect of this non - smoothness on the emitted gravitational waves looks like very small ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : waveform ] and [ fig : test ] ) .",
    "actually cunningham , price & moncrief also adopted the non - smoothness initial condition in their calculations @xcite .",
    "additionally the initial data for @xmath155 , @xmath157 , and @xmath156 at @xmath207 are derived from the junction conditions .",
    "then , as mentioned in the previous section , the variables for matter perturbations , @xmath227 , @xmath228 , and @xmath229 , can be determined by using the initial distributions for metric perturbations .",
    "finally we also add an assumption that @xmath230 at @xmath203 .      for the numerical integration we have to impose the boundary conditions .",
    "one is the regularity condition at the stellar center ( @xmath231 ) and the other is the no incoming - waves condition at the infinity .",
    "the regularity condition at the stellar center demands that @xmath232 , which is reduced to @xmath233 . with respect to the no incoming radiation condition at the infinity , we adopt the condition as @xmath234 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "when the stellar surface reaches the event horizon , the junction conditions discussed earlier in  [ sec : iii-3 ] can not be used any more because the terms related to @xmath235 diverge . instead of these junction conditions , following @xcite",
    ", we adopt an extrapolation for the value of @xmath179 on the junction null surface , @xmath191 , in the vicinity of the point @xmath192 in fig .",
    "[ fig : calculation - region ] as @xmath236 where @xmath237 and @xmath238 are the values of @xmath179 and @xmath29 on @xmath191 at @xmath239-th time steps , while @xmath240 denotes the total number of time steps in region ii , and @xmath241 .",
    "in order to verify our numerical code , we have calculated quadrupole gravitational radiations emitted during the collapse of a nonmagnetized homogeneous dust sphere , i.e. , the gravitational waves emitted from the oppenheimer - snyder solution .",
    "the number of spatial grid points inside the star , @xmath242 , which corresponds to region i , is chosen to be @xmath243 , because we can not see a dramatic improvement with lager number of grid points . actually , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : waveform ] , the waveforms of gravitational waves emitted from the collapsing dust ball with @xmath243 are very similar to those with @xmath244 , and the total energies of emitted gravitational waves defined later also agree with each other within @xmath245 % for @xmath246 and @xmath247 % for @xmath248 . in region",
    "iii , the step size for integration is given as @xmath249 , where @xmath250 is determined with the expected maximum time for observer , @xmath251 , and the position of observer described in tortoise coordinate , @xmath252 , as @xmath253 .",
    "in this paper we adopt that @xmath254 and @xmath255 , respectively , where the position of observer is the same choice as the previous study by cunningham , price & moncrief @xcite .",
    "since the numerical code in this region is essentially the same as that in paper i , the number of grid points for outgoing null coordinate , @xmath256 , in region iii is assumed to be @xmath257 in this paper ( see table i in paper i for the convergence test ) .",
    "then we have only one parameter to determine the emitted gravitational waves , i.e. , the initial radius @xmath258 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this article , with the gauge - invariant perturbation theory we have studied the dependence of the stellar magnetic fields on the polar gravitational waves during the collapse of a homogeneous dust sphere .",
    "it should be emphasized that this is first calculation of emitted polar gravitational waves on the dynamical background spacetime with the covariant gauge - invariant formalism on the spherically symmetric spacetime and the coordinate - independent matching conditions at stellar surface , which is devised by gundlach and martn - garca @xcite .",
    "so far , such calculations could not be done due to the difficulty to treat the boundary conditions at stellar surface . while , in order to solve this difficulty , we evolve not only zerille function , @xmath179 , but also metric perturbation , @xmath172 , in the intermediate exterior region ( region ii ) and the calculation of emitted gravitational waves is successful .    with this nemerical code , we consider the magnetic effects on the polar gravitational waves from the oppenheimer - snyder solution describing collapsing dust , where the magnetic fields are introduced as a second order perturbation term . even if the initial magnetic perturbations are small , as the collapse proceeds they could get amplified and become significant because of the conservation of magnetic flux . in particular , similar to paper",
    "i , we have assumed that the magnetic field is axisymmetric , where the dipole magnetic field perturbations are the ones that couple to the quadrupole polar perturbations of the gravitational field .",
    "additionally , we assumed momentarily static initial data and we have not taken into account the influence of the exterior magnetic field in the propagating gravitational waves .    through the investigation",
    ", it is found that there exists an evidence of the strong influence of the magnetic field in the gravitational wave luminosity during the collapse .",
    "depending on the initial profile of the magnetic field and its ratio between the poloidal and toroidal components , the energy outcome can be easily up to a few order higher than what we get from the nonmagnetized collapse .",
    "in addition , it is possible to observe an important change before the quasi - normal ringing is detected , which is induced by the presence of the magnetic field .",
    "these magnetic effects can be seen the collapsing model with large inital radius and with large magnetic ratio between the poloidal and toroidal components , since for a large initial radius the time needed for the black hole formation is longer and then the magnetic field acts for longer time on the collapsing fluid .",
    "it notes that the magnetic effects on the polar gravitational waves are different from those on the axial ones , i.e. , the axial gravitational waves are independent from the magnetic ratio while they depend only on the magnetic strenght such as the value of @xmath259",
    ". such magnetic effects could be helpful to extract some information of inner magnetic profiles of progenitor form the detection of gravitational waves radiated from the black hole formation after the stellar collapse .    at the end , we believe that although this study might be considered as a `` toy problem '' it has most of the ingredients needed in emphasizing the importance of the magnetic fields in the study of the gravitational wave output during the collapse . the final answer to the questions raised here would be provided by the 3d numerical mhd codes ( see in @xcite for the recent developments ) , but this work provides hints and raises issues that need to be studied .",
    "furthermore , as future studies , we condiser to study magnetic effects on the gravitational waves emitted from the more complicated background collapsing models such as inhomogeneous dust collapse and the stellar collapse with perfect fluid , while it should be also important to take into account the background magnetic field such as @xcite",
