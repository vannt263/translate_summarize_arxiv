    "we will prove the following :    let @xmath3 be a one - ended , simply connected , locally compact anr with pro - monomorphic fundamental group at infinity . if @xmath3 admits a @xmath722 action by covering transformations that is not cocompact , then @xmath3 is simply connected at infinity .",

    "so the techniques of  [ section : rectangular neighborhoods ] , applied to @xmath755 , show that this space has arbitrarily small rectangular neighborhoods of infinity with fundamental group described by a graph of groups with just two vertices and one edge  all labeled by @xmath274 .    to understand the fundamental group at infinity for @xmath756 , first use theorem [ th : stably free theorem ] to deduce that @xmath3 has a stable finitely generated free fundamental group at infinity . if @xmath757 , where @xmath758 is a finitely generated free group , then by lemma [ lemma : torus - like nbds - stable case ] , @xmath759 has stable pro-@xmath230 isomorphic to a semidirect product @xmath760 . applying lemma [ lemma : torus - like nbds - stable case ] a second time , we see that @xmath756 has a stable fundamental group at infinity of the form @xmath761 .",
    "combining the above observations , we have @xmath762 . when a semidirect product is abelian , the factor groups must both be abelian and the product an ordinary direct product .",
