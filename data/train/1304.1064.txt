    "in earlier papers we described a stimulated thermal rayleigh scattering process ( strs ) that can account for observed modal instability in large mode area fiber amplifiers , and we described in detail our numerical model of this process@xcite . our model computes the mode coupling gain and the laser gain for fiber amplifiers with practically achievable step index profiles operating at realistic pump and signal powers .",
    "it was shown that the quantum defect heating associated with laser amplification , in conjunction with a frequency offset between the strong fundamental mode and the weak parasitic higher order mode , leads to a high exponential gain for the parasitic mode .",
    "consequently , mode instability has a sharp power threshold , above which the output beam quality is severely degraded .",
    "the essence of the strs process responsible for mode instability is that laser gain necessarily deposits quantum defect heat in the core of the amplifier fiber , and the asymmetric heating produced by the asymmetric signal irradiance profile due to interference between modes lp@xmath1 and lp@xmath2 leads to an asymmetric thermal lens that couples light between those two modes .",
    "an additional requirement is that there be a phase shift between the temperature grating and the signal irradiance grating which , in our strs model , is created by the time lag between an irradiance grating traveling along the fiber and the temperature grating that it creates .",
    "our model imposes a steady - periodic condition on the temperature grating because we assume the frequency offset between modes has a narrow linewidth .",
    "alternative strs models have been presented by hansen _",
    "et al._@xcite and by dong@xcite .",
    "they used similar approximations , including the steady - periodic assumption , and they predict instability thresholds similar to ours .",
    "another model by ward _",
    "et al._@xcite is based on strs , but without the steady - periodic assumption .",
    "it also predicts thresholds similar to ours .",
    "the primary difference in the physics of the various models is that the models of hansen _ et al .",
    "_ and dong assume the profile of the quantum defect heating matches the profile of the signal light , while our model and that of ward _",
    "_ compute the heat profile based on the local change in either the pump or signal irradiance calculated using the local upper state population . in the model of ward _",
    "the increase of signal power in a mode due to laser gain is found from the overlap of the local gain @xmath3 with the field of that mode . in our bpm model laser gain",
    "increases the total signal field locally and is then apportioned among the modes automatically by diffraction in the presence of the core index step .",
    "either the local signal field growth or the local pump irradiance loss is used to compute the quantum defect heating .",
    "hansen _ et al . _ and dong showed that using their assumed heat profile the mode coupling gain is related in a simple way to the laser gain .",
    "this would imply that the mode instability threshold is largely determined by the net laser gain , and can be adjusted only by changing the modal profiles and their overlap with the yb@xmath0 doping profile .",
    "in fact , they show that by using a low value of the @xmath4 parameter or by confining the yb@xmath0 doping to the central portion of the core , the threshold is raised .",
    "however , we show in this report that the existence of depletion of the upper state yb@xmath0 population breaks the simple connection between laser gain and mode coupling gain , making it possible to design fibers with substantially higher mode coupling thresholds than predicted by hansen _",
    "et al . _ and by dong .",
    "an amplifier that is designed to reach a specific level of laser amplification can be designed to avoid the mode instability .",
    "specifically , by designing the amplifier so it has a higher ratio of pump cladding diameter to core diameter , the strs threshold can be raised .",
    "of course this requires a longer fiber and a smaller core , a combination that is problematic for sbs suppression . in practice",
    "the amplifier must achieve a suitable balance between strs and sbs suppression .",
    "we will also discuss how to achieve this balance .",
    "in computing the upper state population fraction @xmath5 we use the steady state expression @xmath6 here the @xmath7 s are the absorption and emission cross sections for the pump and the signal , the @xmath8 s are the optical frequencies , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the pump and signal irradiances .",
    "the amplifier parameters used throughout this report are listed in table 1 .",
    "we model a fiber with a 50 @xmath11 m diameter step index core with a typical numerical aperture of 0.054 .",
    "the yb@xmath0 doping density is also typical of high power amplifiers ."
