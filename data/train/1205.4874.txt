    "perfect secrecy systems ( or codes ) play a prominent role in information theory and cryptography . in terms of information theoretic security",
    ", these systems shall ensure protection of the confidentiality of sensitive information in the presence of eavesdropping .",
    "the information theoretic , or unconditional , security model does not depend on any complexity assumptions and hence can not be broken given unlimited computational resources .",
    "a well - known example of a perfect secrecy system is vernam s one - time pad . in his landmark paper `` communication theory of secrecy systems ''  @xcite , shannon established a fundamental characterization of optimal perfect secrecy systems : a key - minimal secrecy system achieves perfect secrecy if and only if the encryption matrix is a latin square and the keys are used with equal probability .",
    "important generalizations have been obtained since then ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to the concept of perfect secrecy , various scenarios require that the systems provide robustness against spoofing attacks . concerning the aspect of authenticity , the integrity of information that is communicated via a potentially insecure channel",
    "shall be assured .",
    "often such constructions involve a variety of tools from combinatorics ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .    in this paper , we present novel perfect secrecy systems that provide immunity to spoofing attacks under equiprobable source probability distributions . in the past decades various perfect secrecy systems",
    "have been constructed that offer zero ( like vernam s one - time pad ) or onefold security against spoofing .",
    "recently , in  @xcite , the first infinite classes of optimal perfect secrecy systems that achieve twofold security have been constructed as well as further optimal systems that offer up to @xmath4-fold security against spoofing under equiprobable source probability distributions .",
    "this has been achieved by means of particular steiner @xmath0-designs , e.g. , the famous witt design .",
    "however , as steiner are not known to exist for @xmath5 , the level of security can not be augmented any further via this approach . in the present paper , we develop a more general construction method , which allows us to use for higher values of @xmath0 under equiprobable source probability distributions . on the theoretical side ,",
    "relying on teirlinck s existence result for @xmath0-designs  @xcite , our method constructively generates systems that can reach an arbitrary high security level . on the practical side , by using cyclic difference families , we give very efficient constructions of new optimal systems that are onefold secure against spoofing . by employing for large values of @xmath0",
    ", we also present the first near - optimal systems that are @xmath1- and @xmath2-fold secure as well as further systems with a feasible number of keys that are @xmath3-fold secure against spoofing .",
    "moreover , we apply our results to an extended authentication model , where the opponent has access to a verification oracle .",
    "this model , which has been recently introduced and investigated in  @xcite , allows a more powerful pro - active attack scenario .",
    "the opponent may send a message of the opponent s choice to the receiver and observe the receiver s response whether or not the receiver accepts it as authentic .",
    "this can be modeled in terms of a verification oracle with an online / offline variant that provides a response to a query message in the same way as the message would be accepted or not by the legitimate receiver .",
    "we obtain this way novel perfect secrecy systems with immunity to spoofing attacks in the verification oracle model .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : the underlying information theoretic shannon ",
    "simmons model is given in section  [ model ] .",
    "section  [ combstru ] introduces background material on combinatorial structures that is important for our further purposes .",
    "section  [ known ] presents a short overview of known constructions of perfect secrecy systems that provide robustness against spoofing attacks . in section  [ newmethod ] ,",
    "a general construction method is developed and we examine the level of security from a theoretical point of view . the subsequent two sections deal then with the practical side : we give explicit constructions of optimal systems with onefold immunity to spoofing in section  [ one_immune ] , and of near - optimal and other feasible systems with multifold immunity in section  [ multi_immune ] . in section  [ oracle ] , we apply our constructions to the verification oracle model .",
    "the paper is concluded in section  [ conl ] .",
    "we rely on the _ information theoretic _ ( or _ unconditional _ ) secrecy model developed by shannon  @xcite , and by simmons ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) including authentication .",
    "our notation follows , for the most part , that of  @xcite . in this model of authentication and secrecy",
    "three participants are involved : a _ transmitter _ , a _ receiver _ , and an _ opponent_. the transmitter wants to communicate information to the receiver via a public communications channel .",
    "the receiver in return would like to be confident that any received information actually came from the transmitter and not from some opponent ( _ integrity _ of information ) .",
    "the transmitter and the receiver are assumed to trust each other .",
    "this is known as an _ authentication system _ ( or _ authentication code , @xmath6-code _ ) .    in what follows ,",
    "let @xmath7 denote a set of @xmath8 _ source states _ ( or _ plaintexts _ ) , @xmath9 a set of @xmath10 _ messages _ ( or _ ciphertexts _ ) , and @xmath11 a set of @xmath12 _ encoding rules _ ( or _ keys _ ) .",
    "using an encoding rule @xmath13 , the transmitter encrypts a source state @xmath14 to obtain the message @xmath15 to be sent over the channel .",
    "the encoding rule is an injective function from @xmath7 to @xmath9 , and is communicated to the receiver via a secure channel prior to any messages being sent . for each encoding rule @xmath16 ,",
    "let @xmath17 denote the set of _ valid _ messages .",
    "a received message @xmath18 will be accepted by the receiver as being authentic if and only if @xmath19 .",
    "when this is fulfilled , the receiver decrypts the message @xmath18 by applying the decoding rule @xmath20 , where @xmath21 an authentication system can be represented algebrai - cally by a @xmath22__-encoding matrix _ _ with the rows indexed by the encoding rules , the columns indexed by the source states , and the entries defined by @xmath23 ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) .    concerning authenticity , we address the following scenario , called _ spoofing attack _ of order @xmath26 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) : suppose that an opponent observes @xmath27 distinct messages , which are sent through the public channel using the same encoding rule .",
    "the opponent then inserts a new message @xmath28 ( being distinct from the @xmath26 messages already sent ) , hoping to have it accepted by the receiver as authentic .",
    "the cases @xmath29 and @xmath30 are called _ impersonation game _ and _ substitution game _ , respectively .",
    "these cases have been studied in detail in recent years , whereas less is known for higher orders .    for any @xmath26",
    ", we assume that there is some probability distribution on the set of of source states , so that any set of @xmath26 source states has a non - zero probability of occurring . for simplification ,",
    "we ignore the order in which the @xmath26 source states occur , and assume that no source state occurs more than once . given this probability distribution @xmath31 on @xmath7 , the receiver and transmitter",
    "choose a probability distribution @xmath32 on @xmath11 ( called _ encoding strategy _ ) with associated independent random variables @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",

    "the _ deception probability _ @xmath37 is the probability that the opponent can deceive the receiver with a spoofing attack of order @xmath26 .",
    "combinatorial lower bounds can be given as follows ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    in an authentication system with @xmath8 source states and @xmath10 messages , for every @xmath38",
    ", the deception probabilities are bounded below by @xmath39    an authentication system is called @xmath0__-fold secure against spoofing _ _ if @xmath40 for all @xmath38 . the following theorem ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) establishes a combinatorial lower bound on the number of encoding rules for this kind of attack .",
    "[ thm_mas_sch ] if an authentication system is @xmath41-fold against spoofing , then the number of encoding rules is bounded below by @xmath42    such a system is called _ optimal _ if the number of encoding rules meets the lower bound with equality .    concerning secrecy , we recall shannon s fundamental idea of perfect secrecy ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) : an authentication system is said to have _ perfect secrecy _ if @xmath43 for every source state @xmath14 and every message @xmath44 .",
    "that is , the _ a posteriori _ probability that the source state is @xmath45 , given that the message @xmath18 is observed , is identical to the _ a priori _ probability that the source state is @xmath45 . from bayes",
    "theorem follows that @xmath46 this yields :    [ frequency ] an authentication system has perfect secrecy if and only if @xmath47 for every source state @xmath14 and every message @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , if the encoding rules in a system are used with equal probability , then a given message @xmath18 occurs with the same frequency in each column of the encoding matrix .",

    "we present a simple example ( due to van rees , cf .",
    "@xcite ) :    a @xmath65 array @xmath6 can be constructed by developing the five rows @xmath66 modulo 11 .",
    "every pair @xmath67 occurs in three rows of @xmath6 . within these three rows",
    ", @xmath68 occurs once in each of the three columns , as does @xmath69 .",

    "this more powerful , _ pro - active _ attack scenario can be modeled in terms of a v - oracle that provides a response ( _ accept _ or _ reject _ ) to a query message in the same way as the message would be accepted or not by the legitimate receiver .",
    "this attack model was recently introduced in  @xcite .",
    "we recall and slightly adjust the notation as far as it is necessary for our consideration .",

    "the query and the spoofing phase are separated .",
    "first , the opponent makes all his queries to the oracle , and then uses this collected ( state ) information to construct a spoofing message . in both scenarios ,",
    "the opponent is assumed to be adaptive .",
    "the online attack models an opponent s interaction with a verification oracle such as an atm machine , while in the offline attack the opponent may have captured an offline verification box .",
