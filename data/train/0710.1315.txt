    "graphene , a single layer of graphite , has lately attracted increasing attention , especially since its experimental realization @xcite . this material presents a number of unusual electronic features , such as a landau level structure that gives rise to half - integer quantum hall effect . in general , those properties can be traced back to the low - energy spectrum , governed by two - component massless fermions that come in four flavors : two due to electronic spin and two from degenerate dirac points in the band structure @xcite .",
    "the quasi - relativistic electronic spectrum is characterized by a velocity @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the speed of light . however , the coulomb interaction , which is instantaneous for all practical purposes , breaks this emergent lorentz invariance .",
    "in particular , the electron velocity becomes scale - dependent  @xcite .",
    "it was noted recently @xcite that a generalizaton of the low - energy theory that describes graphene possesses a quantum critical point .",
    "reference   considered a model of @xmath0 species of @xmath5 dimensional two - component massless dirac fermions interacting through a 3d instantaneous coulomb interaction with a coupling constant @xmath6 .",
    "it was then shown , by analyzing the renormalization group ( rg ) flow of the fermion velocity , that for sufficiently large @xmath0 , the strongly coupled limit @xmath7 is a quantum critical point , characterized by a dynamic critical exponent @xmath8 .",
    "it was also argued that real graphene is close to this critical point for a large momentum window .    in the present work",
    "we further explore the quantum critical properties of this theory by studying the rg flow of various quartic perturbations of the thirring @xcite and gross - neveu @xcite varieties .",
    "these four - fermion interactions are irrelevant at weak coupling , but obtain nontrivial anomalous dimensions of order @xmath2 at the strong coupling fixed point .",
    "if a four - fermi coupling becomes relevant below some @xmath0 , one may expect dynamical gap generation , in which case the system becomes an insulator , or that the system would flow to another fixed point .",
    "the question of whether the coulomb interaction makes graphene an insulator has been considered previously . in ref .",
    "it was found from solving the gap equation with a screened coulomb interaction that , for @xmath9 , a gap opens at sufficiently large coupling . for @xmath10",
    "the system remain gapless at all couplings .",
    "this was confirmed in ref .   using a similar approach .",
    "however , as the approximations employed in these works are uncontrolled , one would like to explore alternative approaches to this problem .",
    "the rg analysis in this paper is one of them .",
    "( instability toward ferromagnetism has also been considered  @xcite . )",
    "we implement a wilson - fisher rg transformation and find the anomalous dimensions of the various couplings . throughout the paper",
    "the coulomb parameter @xmath11 is kept finite and the limit @xmath12 is discussed at the end . in this limit we identify both relevant and irrelevant directions in the parameter space of the quartic couplings and discuss possible scenarios , including gap generation and the the flow to a new non - gaussian fixed point . at the end of our results section we address the relevance of our findings for real graphene .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the model and feynman rules are presented in section ii , the details of the calculation are outlined in section iii , the results are discussed in section iv and the conclusions presented in section v.",
    "consider a model of @xmath13 flavors of four - component relativistic fermions ( or @xmath0 flavors of two - component fermions ) @xmath14 interacting through an instantaneous coulomb interaction and through generic u(@xmath13)-symmetric quartic interactions .",

    "in the real world @xmath22 , corresponding to two spin polarizations of the electrons .",
    "the two two - component spinors near the two valleys are combined into a four - component spinor .",
    "the action  ( [ se ] ) is invariant under spin rotations , but is not invariant under rotations in the valley space .",
    "notice that the four - fermi terms are rotationally invariant , but not lorentz invariant : the latter is broken by the coulomb interaction .",
    "apart from the four - fermi terms written in  ( [ se ] ) , one can also introduce an independent set equal to @xmath23 times the vertices already included , where @xmath23 is linearly independent from the other @xmath24-matrices and @xmath25 . one possible choice is @xmath26 such matrices , together with the ones already considered , form a complete basis for the algebra of @xmath27 dirac matrices .",
    "we restrict for the moment to the action ( [ se ] ) , but we shall comment on these extra vertices in our discussion section .",
    "we shall use the large-@xmath0 limit to do calculations at large values of the coupling @xmath6 , so @xmath0 will remain arbitary ( but large ) until the end .",
    "notice that , unlike the fermionic degrees of freedom , the coulomb field @xmath28 lives in @xmath29 dimensions , which is reflected in its kinetic term . in the strong coupling @xmath30 limit this term disappears and the @xmath28 propagator is dominated by quantum corrections coming from the fermion loops , as we shall see below .",

    "the only significant step that remains to be discussed is straightforward dirac algebra to find the products of a small number of @xmath24 matrices ( coming from the vertices and the fermion propagators ) .",

    "only diagonal flow is generated , i.e. this vertex does not contribute to the flow of the others .",
    "in general , however , there is operator mixing : each vertex contributes to its own flow but also to other vertices .",
    "our result turns out to be @xmath80      upon integration of the high - momentum degrees of freedom , new coordinates and fields are defined , that are rescaled versions of the original ones . doing this",

    "@xmath84 @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and ... contains all the terms in the action that are not quadratic in the fermion fields .",
    "we shall renormalize the field as @xmath87 and enforce the nonrenormalization of the fermion velocity by requiring @xmath88 which means that the integration shells should actually be non - spherical and have radii related by @xmath89 however @xmath90 , therefore the deviation from spherical symmetry is small and is not important to the order of @xmath2 we are considering .",

    "the diagram of fig .",
    "( [ fig : selfenergy ] ) would be of order one .",
    "to see how the wavefunction renormalization affects the running of the four - fermi coupling , we write down a generic quartic term in the action @xmath92 rescaling of the momenta and the fields as discussed above leads to a renormalization of the coupling constant @xmath1 according to @xmath93 where we have also included the contribution @xmath94 from the vertex renormalization , and where @xmath95 comes from wavefunction renormalization .    from eqs .",

    "this is simply a consequence of @xmath103 .",
    "there is no mixing between these new vertices and the ones considered in our calculation .",
    "the list of the most relevant operators may then be extended to include @xmath104 whose the anomalous dimensions are also @xmath100 .    in the large @xmath0 limit ,",
    "the anomalous dimensions are small , hence all four - fermi operators have dimensions close to 4 and are irrelevant",
    ". however , as one decreases @xmath0 the dimensions of some operators decrease as well .",
    "naively , at @xmath105 the operators in  ( [ operators ] ) and  ( [ operators2 ] ) would have dimensions less than 3 , and become relevant .",
    "of course , this is only an extrapolation of our leading - order result to finite @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , it is quite interesting that @xmath106 is close to the real - world value of @xmath107 .",
    "( for comparison , for the lorentz - invariant thirring model the critical number of four - component dirac fermions is quoted as @xmath108  @xcite , to be compared with @xmath109 . ) due to the limitation of our calculations , we can not determine whether the exact @xmath106 is smaller or larger than 4 .    if @xmath110 , then the physics at @xmath107 and infinite coupling is governed by the strong - coupling fixed point discussed in ref .  .",
    "if @xmath111 , then there are two further possibilities for @xmath107 , @xmath112 .",
    "it may turn out that the system develops a gap , and becomes an insulator . in this case one",
    "expects a bifermion operator to have a nonzero expectation value , breaking a discrete symmetry .",
    "unfortunately , simply from the form of the operators  ( [ operators ] ) and ( [ operators2 ] ) it is not possible to conclude , with definiteness , which of the discrete symmetries will be spontaneously broken .",
    "another possibility is that the coupling flows into a new stable fixed point ( a similar situation was discussed in ref .  .",
