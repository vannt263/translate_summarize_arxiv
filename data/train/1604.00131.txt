    "while they found the position of 1024-br  to be coincident with that of the pulsar to within @xmath24 , they rejected an association between 1024-br  and the pulsar because ( i ) 1024-bris much more distant than the distance estimate for the pulsar then available ; ( ii ) the proper motion of 1024-br , which they estimated by comparing their observations with earlier catalogs , disagreed with the proper motion of the pulsar reported by @xcite ; and ( iii ) the very small timing residuals of the pulsar suggested that it was an isolated object , with no evidence for binary motion .",

    "all of these recent pulsar timing distances are consistent with each other , and they are incompatible with the distance upper limit @xmath30  kpc derived from the shklovskii effect using the latest proper motion measurements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "three of these papers argued that the discrepancy between these distances could be resolved if the pulsar were undergoing acceleration , @xmath31 , due to gravitational interaction with another object @xcite .",

    "if the pulsar were undergoing negative acceleration , @xmath34 , the resulting negative @xmath35 term would allow for a larger positive @xmath36 term , which in turn would allow it to contain a larger distance than the previous upper limit of 0.430  kpc .",
    "such a gravitational interaction ( i.e. , an orbit ) could potentially be manifested in timing observations as a rotation period second derivative , @xmath37 , due to the jerk , or change in acceleration , of the pulsar ( details discussed below ) .",

    "the arrival times were fit to a standard timing model using the tempo package .",
    "the timing model included : astrometric parameters ; independent dispersion measure at every epoch ( where epoch is defined as a period of six days or less ) ; a white noise model ; and a pulsar frequency model as described below .",

    "arrival times were adjusted following the tt(bipm15 ) time scale , and parameters are ultimately presented in barycentric dynamical time ( tdb ) . besides using updated ephemeris and time standards , the primary difference between our work and the analysis procedure of @xcite is our use of frequency derivatives , as described below , instead of a red noise model .",

    "we measured a significant rotation frequency second derivative , @xmath67 .",
    "this could arise due to binary motion or due to noise in the rotation of the pulsar ( `` timing noise '' ) .",
    "to check for the latter possibility , we compare our observations with a scaling law for timing noise developed by @xcite .",
    "we use their model which incorporated canonical pulsars , millisecond pulsars , and magnetars . given the @xmath61 and @xmath68 of psr  j1024@xmath00719 , and given the time span of our observations , their model predicts excess residuals of 0.06  @xmath11s , albeit with large uncertainty .",
    "we estimate that our measured @xmath69 would contribute 0.40  @xmath11s if not included in the timing model , substantially more than the noise model prediction .",
    "therefore it is unlikely , though not impossible , that the observed @xmath69 is due to timing noise . for the remainder of this paper ,",
    "we interpret @xmath69 as the jerk , or change in acceleration , of the pulsar due to binary motion .",
    "the measured @xmath69 is equivalent to period second derivative @xmath70 .",
    "this is in agreement with the value of @xmath71 reported by @xcite .",
    "our measurement uncertainty is relatively large due to covariance between @xmath69 and variations in interstellar dm , which we fit independently at every epoch simultaneously with the other parameters ; in contrast , @xcite used a linear model in dm which was held fixed in their final timing solutions . in the presence of significant dm variations ( figure  [ fig : residual_dmx ] )",
    "we believe our method yields the most robust values of @xmath69 or @xmath37 .",
    "this same reasoning applies to our ( non - significant ) measurement of @xmath72 . for example , changing the nature of the dm fit in our 6-year long data - set from a constant value , to a polynomial of degree up to 7 , or to the by - epoch fit given in table 2 , changes @xmath65 by @xmath73 .",

    "we varied orbital period @xmath165 , inclination @xmath164 , eccentricity @xmath187 , distance @xmath12 , companion mass @xmath161 , and proper motion @xmath11 , along with nuisance parameters for the mean anomaly and the longitude of periastron .",
    "as in  [ sec : circularorbits ] , for simplicity , we held the pulsar mass fixed at @xmath188 ; analysis with different pulsar mass values would produce qualitatively similar results , with minor rescalings of parameter values .",
    "we assumed prior distributions on the parallax ( @xmath189mas ) and proper motion ( @xmath190 ) from our updated timing (   [ sec : timing ] ) , and @xmath191 to match our sed fitting .",
    "we also included flat prior distributions on @xmath192 and @xmath193 .",
    "the posterior was evaluated with a hard cutoff for @xmath8 , requiring it to be between 0 and @xmath194 .",
    "we evaluated goodness - of - fit by comparing the inferred @xmath184 against the measured value of @xmath195 as well as the projected separation with best - fit value of 0 and uncertainty of @xmath104 .",
    "using ` emcee ` @xcite we used 600 `` walkers '' for 50,000 iterations each , starting the walkers off randomly distributed in phase space according to the priors described above . after removing 100 iterations for `` burn - in '' and thinning the samples by a factor of about 1000 to account for correlations among the points , we had roughly 20,000 individual samples for each parameter .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : mcmc ] .",
    "we see results broadly consistent with our inferences from the edge - on circular orbits : binary periods near @xmath196yr are preferred , as are edge - on orbits , and overall lower eccentricities are better but no eccentricity is excluded .",
    "there is a general covariance between @xmath165 and @xmath164 , with smaller periods needed at more face - on inclinations ( reinforcing our results from above ) but allowing larger distances , and the minimum binary periods are around 2kyr . the lower binary periods are preferred solutions with higher eccentricities , and there is a clear selection of eccentricity based on the sign of @xmath197 : if @xmath198 then more circular ( and hence wider and more edge - on ) orbits are preferred , but if @xmath199 then circular orbits can not fit the data ( following fig .",
    "[ fig : pdot ] ) and we need higher eccentricities , lower @xmath165 , and more face - on orbits .",
    "overall , we conclude that a wide binary system is completely compatible with all of the observational constraints on psr  j1024@xmath00719  and 1024-br .",
    "we now consider the implications of such a binary system for some of the puzzling measurements discussed above .",
    "the @xmath21-ray efficiency should be revised for the updated @xmath41 and distance .",
    "the @xmath21-ray flux is @xmath200 @xcite , so the luminosity is @xmath201 ( assuming beaming into @xmath202ster ) . if @xmath8 is as high as @xmath194 which is certainly possible ( figs .",
    "[ fig : pdot ] and [ fig : mcmc ] ) , this implies a spin - down luminosity as large as @xmath203 , or a @xmath21-ray efficiency as low as @xmath204% .",
    "likely the true value is not this low , but this at least resolves the possible problem raised by @xcite regarding the apparent extremely high efficiency at the parallax distance .",
    "similarly , we must revise the analysis of the x - ray luminosity .",
    "@xcite find a thermal luminosity of @xmath205 .",
    "if @xmath206 is as high as that in the previous analysis , the x - ray efficiency would be as low as @xmath207 , which is somewhat lower than most objects in @xcite but less discrepant than it was before .    while a wide binary system resolves some of the puzzles regarding the distance , a major remaining puzzle is its high transverse velocity , @xmath208 , and what that implies about the possible formation mechanisms . as discussed by @xcite ,",
    "if placed at its parallax distance , psr  j1024@xmath00719  has a much higher velocity than most msps . using a radial velocity @xmath209 , we find velocities @xmath210 relative to the local standard of rest using the solar motion from @xcite .",
    "this agrees roughly with the velocity ellipsoid for metal - poor halo stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "although it prefers metallicities @xmath211dex ) , or with the radial ( * ? ? ?",
    "* edition ) and tangential ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) velocities of globular clusters .",
    "however , it is about 4 times the velocity dispersion for msps @xcite , and if we integrate the orbit of psr  j1024@xmath00719  in the galactic potential ( using ` galpy ` ; @xcite ) we find a scale height of 24kpc ( fig .",
    "[ fig : galactic ] ) , compared to @xmath212kpc for msps ( * ? ? ?",
    "* also see @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that kinematically , psr  j1024@xmath00719  belongs to a separate population than the vast majority of msps , and this may relate to how it was formed .",
    "young pulsars with very high space velocities are known ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and they likely rely on binary disruption and/or supernova kicks for their high velocities .",
    "similarly , hypervelocity stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are often thought to originate @xcite from binaries disrupted by a supermassive black hole ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or a supernova @xcite ; other possibilities such as a tidal stream @xcite or dynamical ejection following an exchange in a dense stellar environment may also operate .",
    "however , the case of psr  j1024@xmath00719  is different from both young pulsars and hypervelocity stars , in that it is presumably recycled following prolonged stellar evolution in a close ( @xmath213day ) binary ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with a companion that is now absent .",
    "instead its companion is anomalous , more like the eccentric binary @xcite .",
    "we note that estimates suggest less than 1% of the msp population originates from the halo @xcite , which could be consistent with finding a single object like psr  j1024@xmath00719  in the @xmath214hundred well - timed msps , but psr  j1024@xmath00719  likely requires a denser natal environment such as a globular cluster ( cf .",
    "* ) to have had the dynamical encounters that removed the original companion and left the current one .",
    "to further explore this topic we compare with @xcite in the globular cluster m4 , which has a white dwarf in a 191-day orbit and a jupiter - mass companion in a decades - long outer orbit @xcite .",
    "most formation scenarios favor a dynamical encounter in the dense core of the globular cluster @xcite which exchanged the planet into the msp system to explain the wide eccentric orbit .",
    "recoil following the exchange can explain why the psr  b1620@xmath026 system is currently on the outskirts of m4 on a wide orbit in the cluster s potential , although it is still likely bound .",
    "as much as 50% of the globular cluster msp population could be ejected @xcite , and further objects could be tidally stripped @xcite , which could explain the origin of psr  j1024@xmath00719  in the galactic plane ( cf .",
    "we suggest that psr  j1024@xmath00719  was formed in a globular cluster ( which form msps at a very high rate due to the many stellar encounters ; e.g. , ) , and that its initial evolution was much like most other such systems with recycling in a compact binary with a white dwarf .",
    "a subsequent dynamical encounter with another binary ( also see * ? ? ? * ) exchanged / ejected the white dwarf and led to the current system .",
    "there might have also been a phase including a triple system , whose disruption might explain the very wide orbit .",
    "eventually , either as the result of the initial encounter or subsequent encounters the psr  j1024@xmath00719  system would have been ejected from the globular cluster ( which only requires a recoil velocity of @xmath215 , consistent with most dynamical predictions ) .",
    "the velocity of the system now would be the halo velocity of the cluster plus a small amount , consistent with the orbit we now see .",
    "note that we can not trace back the system to a potential cluster of origin given the poor knowledge of space velocities for most globular clusters and the unknown age of this system .",
    "however , the sub - solar metallicity we see for 1024-br  is consistent with typical values for globular clusters .",
    "@xcite analyzed the msp velocity distribution and posited a model in which the bulk of the msp population is formed in the galactic disk and has velocities similar to the thermal velocities of other old stellar populations , but in which there are a few high - speed outliers .",
    "our formation scenario for psr  j1024@xmath00719  suggests that ejecta of globular clusters may be the source of the outlier population .",
    "@xcite came to conclusions very similar to ours regarding the nature of the psr  j1024@xmath00719  system using largely independent radio and optical data - sets .",
    "they proposed a formation scenario in which the system is the remnant of a hierarchical triple system formed in the galactic disk , with its high space velocity the result of a supernova kick . in both scenarios",
    "some degree of fine tuning is required to end up with the current barely - bound binary and to match the space velocity .",
    "the true origin may be a combination of both scenarios , with a hierarchical triple evolving in a globular cluster and being ejected as it evolves into a wide msp binary system .",
    "such a scenario might remove some of the fine tuning needed above and in @xcite .",
    "we have presented new radio timing along with archival optical data that strongly suggest psr  j1024@xmath00719  is in a wide ( 220kyr ) binary orbit with a low - mass stellar companion .",
    "our preferred formation mechanism is that the system was formed through a dynamical exchange in a globular cluster , which would explain the strange companion , the wide orbit , and the large space velocity , but this needs to be confirmed with detailed numerical experiments .",
    "the currently available radio timing data can not determine the orbital parameters uniquely , but further observations and astrometric measurements of this system might help pin down its parameters and constrain formation scenarios .",
    "the detection of further period derivatives is one such measurement , although care must be taken to separate dynamical period derivatives from timing noise , dispersion measure variations , and other effects . with observations made over a longer time span , the next - accessible parameter of interest is period third derivative , @xmath197 .",
    "positive values of @xmath197 are required for circular orbits and highly favored for elliptical orbits .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : mcmc ] , the value should be of order @xmath216 , or @xmath217 .",
    "we estimate that such a measurement could be achieved at @xmath218 significance by observations such as ours , using dual - receiver measurements with monthly cadence , made over 15  years .",
    "we emphasize that dual - receiver measurements are critical : even in the existing data set , psr  j1024@xmath00719 shows time - variable dispersion measures more complex than a simple quadratic or cubic pattern over time , the effect of which can only be removed through observations at widely separated radio frequencies .",
    "additional progress will be made by _",
    "observations of the companion to tie its astrometry directly to the icrf at high precision : while the distance is unlikely to be significantly refined for the companion , which leads to a parallax uncertainty of 300@xmath11as @xcite and no radial velocity measurement .",
    "this compares with an uncertainty of 140@xmath11as from @xcite or 230@xmath11as from table  [ table : timing ] . ]",
