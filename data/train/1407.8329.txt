    "the observation of a significant triangular flow parameter @xmath0 of charged hadrons is considered one of the most interesting results from recent heavy ion experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) energies  @xcite .",
    "this large value is attributed to the fluctuations in the initial qcd matter density distribution  @xcite . as thermal emission of photons",
    "is known to be sensitive to the initial temperature of the system , the study of photon @xmath0 can provide valuable information about initial state fluctuation and and its evolution complementary to hadronic observables .",
    "hydrodynamic model calculation with event - by - event ( e - by - e ) fluctuating initial conditions ( ic ) explain the data for hadronic spectra and elliptic flow well upto a large @xmath2 even for most central collisions  @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that fluctuations in the ic enhance the production of thermal photons significantly for @xmath6 2 gev/@xmath4 compared to a smooth initial - state - averaged profile and a better approximation of the direct photon data is obtained in that @xmath2 region  @xcite . in a recent study",
    "we have demonstrated that e - by - e fluctuating ic result in much larger elliptic flow of thermal photons than a smooth ic for @xmath7 2 gev/@xmath4 both at rhic and at the lhc energies  @xcite .",
    "however , we see that the effect of ic fluctuations in not sufficient to explain the direct photon @xmath1 data and our elliptic flow results still underestimate the data by a large margin  @xcite . since a nonzero @xmath0 arises only if there are fluctuations in the initial matter density distribution , photon @xmath0 can provide information about the fluctuating initial state more directly than the elliptic flow parameter  @xcite .",
    "we calculate thermal photon @xmath0 for 040% central collisions of pb nuclei at lhc using the ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional e - by - e hydrodynamic framework developed in  @xcite . this ideal hydrodynamic model with fluctuating ic",
    "is in good agreement with charged particle spectra and elliptic flow  @xcite as well as spectra and elliptic flow of thermal photons at rhic and at the lhc energies  @xcite .",
    "we use state of the art photon rates ( complete leading order plasma rates from  @xcite and hadronic photons from  @xcite ) integrated over the hydrodynamical evolution to calculate the spectra and the anisotropic flow parameters . the initial formation time @xmath8 of the plasma is assumed to be 0.14 fm / c and the fluctuation size parameter @xmath9 as 0.4 fm ( see  @xcite and references therein for details ) .",
    "spectra from smooth ( sic ) and fluctuating ( fic ) initial conditions along with alice direct photon data  @xcite for 040% central collision of pb nuclei at lhc .",
    "@xmath2 spectra calculated using leading order ( lo ) plasma rates  @xcite , next - to - leading order ( nlo ) plasma rates  @xcite and nlo pqcd photons are also plotted for comparison [ see  @xcite].,width=491 ]    figure  [ spec_lhc ] shows thermal photon spectra from e - by - e hydrodynamics along with alice direct photon data  @xcite for 040% central collisions of pb nuclei at lhc  @xcite .",
    "similar to rhic , the @xmath2 spectrum from fluctuating initial conditions ( fic ) is found to be much harder than the result obtained from smooth initial conditions ( sic ) in the region @xmath6 2 gev/@xmath4 .",
    "thermal photons from fluctuating ic along with next - to - leading order ( nlo ) pqcd photons ( which starts dominating the direct photon spectrum for @xmath10 3.5 gev/@xmath4 ) explain the alice data well for @xmath11 gev/@xmath4 .",
    "however , for @xmath12 2 gev/@xmath4 our result underestimates the data which can only be explained if the contribution from the hadronic phase is increased by an order of magnitude .",
    "we see that the inclusion of the nlo plasma rates  @xcite to our calculation enhance the production of thermal photons by a factor of about 1020% in the region @xmath12 2 gev/@xmath4 . for @xmath7 2 gev/@xmath4 however , the difference between the complete lo and nlo results is not significant as shown in figure  [ spec_lhc ] .",
    "in addition , e - by - e calculation of anisotropic flow parameter using the nlo plasma rate is numerically expensive process .",
    "hence , in practice we calculate thermal photon @xmath0 using the complete lo plasma rates  @xcite which is an excellent approximation .",
    "the triangular flow parameter @xmath0 of thermal photons for 040% central collisions of lead nuclei at 2.76a tev at lhc is shown in figure  [ v3 ] .",
    "@xmath0 is calculated with respect to the participant plane ( pp ) by taking average over a sufficiently large number of events using the relation @xmath13 here the participant plane angle @xmath14 is defined as @xmath15 @xmath16 is the energy density , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the azimuthal angle in the above equation . the initial triangular eccentricity of the matter density is calculated using @xmath19 \\varepsilon \\left (    x , y,\\tau_{0}\\right ) } { \\int \\mathrm{d } x \\mathrm{d } y \\ ; r^{3 } \\varepsilon    \\left ( x , y,\\tau _ { 0}\\right ) } \\ , .\\ ] ]     with respect to participant plane ( pp ) and reaction plane ( rp ) for 2.76a tev pb+pb collisions at lhc and for 040% centrality bin along with photon @xmath1 results  @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath0(pp ) and the reaction plane ( rp ) @xmath0 are shown in figure  [ v3 ] along with the elliptic flow parameter @xmath1 of thermal photons for comparison .",
    "we see a large value of @xmath0(pp ) for @xmath12 6 gev/@xmath4 compared with the elliptic flow results .",
    "in addition , @xmath0(pp ) shows similar qualitative nature to the photon @xmath1 where it is small at low @xmath2 , then rises with @xmath2 , peaks around 23 gev/@xmath4 , and then drops for larger values of @xmath2 .",
    "it is well known that the average collision geometry plays a significant role in determining @xmath1 and thus one finds large elliptic flow even with smooth initial conditions and with respect to the reaction plane angle .",
    "however , @xmath0 ( rp ) from individual events is found to be both positive and negative as @xmath5 is uncorrelated with the rp , and thus after averaging over a large number of events we find @xmath0(rp ) close to zero .    in case of hadrons ,",
    "the magnitude of the initial triangular eccentricity @xmath5 is the main determining factor for the size of the final state @xmath0 .",
    "however this is not true for photons . from a study of individual events",
    "we see that events with larger early time values of transverse flow velocity ( @xmath20 ) correlate best with @xmath0 for thermal photons and that conversely the magnitude of @xmath0 does not strongly correlate with the value of @xmath5 .",
    "we conclude that fast @xmath20 builtup driven by fluctuations dominates over the initial geometry effects in determining the @xmath0 of thermal photons ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the photon @xmath0 results are expected to be sensitive to the initial parameters of the model calculation and we study this dependence by changing @xmath9 and @xmath8 from their default values",
    ". a larger @xmath9 results in a smaller triangular flow whereas a larger @xmath8 gives larger @xmath0 especially in the region @xmath6 2 gev/@xmath4 .",
    "the initial density distribution becomes smoother for larger @xmath9 and we get smaller @xmath0 . on the other hand for larger @xmath8 , a large fraction of the high @xmath2 photons with smaller flow velocities are not included in the calculation and we get a much larger @xmath0 at higher @xmath2 ( at the expense of significantly reducing the total yield ) .",
    "we see a positive and substantial value of the triangular flow parameter @xmath0 of thermal photons at lhc from e - by - e ideal hydrodynamic model .",
    "@xmath0(pp ) is found to be about half of the value of @xmath1(pp ) at @xmath2= 1 gev/@xmath4 .",
    "however , for @xmath21 gev/@xmath4 the difference between these two anisotropy parameters is less than 25% .",
    "we know that for hadronic @xmath0 the initial triangular geometry of the overlapping zone dominates over the local fluctuations , however this is not true for photon @xmath0 .",
    "we conclude from a study of individual events that unlike in the case of hadron @xmath0 where the magnitue of @xmath5 is a good predictor for the observed value , photon @xmath0 is driven by a different dynamics having to do with fast buildup of transverse flow due to fluctuations .",
