    "transmission over long distances often requires significant amounts of energy in order to overcome attenuation .",
    "energy is usually a scarce commodity in wireless ad hoc networks , as nodes typically operate on batteries , which in many cases are difficult to replace or recharge .",
    "thus , energy - efficient schemes for long - distance transmission in wireless networks have recently been of much interest . in some such situations ,",
    "multihop may be a preferred solution .",
    "however , there are several challenges in transmitting real - time services over multiple hops .",
    "for example , the traditional csma / ca based medium access control ( mac ) for avoiding collisions does not work well in a multihop scenario because transmitters are often out of reach of other nodes sensing ranges .",
    "thus , packets traveling across the network experience interference and a large number of collisions , which introduce long delays . also , multihop networks require a high node density which makes routing difficult and affects the reliability of links @xcite .",
    "recently , a collaborative beamforming technique was proposed in @xcite , in which randomly distributed nodes in a network cluster form an antenna array and beamform data to a faraway destination without each node exceeding its power constraint .",
    "the destination receives data with high signal power .",
    "beamforming with antenna arrays is a well studied technology ; it provides space - division multiple access ( sdma ) which enables significant increases in communication rate .",
    "a challenge with implementing beamforming in ad hoc networks is that the geometry of the network may change dynamically . in @xcite , it was shown that randomly distributed nodes can achieve a nice average beampattern with a narrow main lobe and low side lobes .",
    "the directivity of the pattern increases as the number of collaborating nodes increases .",
    "such an approach , when applied in the context of a multihop network reduces the number of hops needed , thereby reducing packet delays and improving throughput .",
    "however , to study network performance , one must take into account the information - sharing time that is required for node collaboration .",
    "if a time - division multiple - access ( tdma ) scheme were to be employed , the information - sharing time would increase proportionally to the number of source nodes ( i.e. , the nodes having packets to transmit ) .    in this paper",
    "we propose a scheme that is based on the idea of collaborative beamforming , and reduces the time required for information sharing .",
    "a preliminary version of the proposed scheme appeared in @xcite .",
    "the work in this paper contains error analysis that provides insight into the performance of the proposed approach .",
    "the main idea is as follows .",
    "different source nodes in the network are allowed to transmit simultaneously .",
    "collaborating nodes receive linear mixtures of the transmitted packets .",
    "subsequently , each collaborating node transmits a weighted version of its received signal .",
    "the weights are such that one or multiple beams are formed , each focusing on one destination node , and reinforcing the signal intended for a particular destination as compared to the other signals .",
    "each collaborating node computes its weight based on the estimated channel coefficients between sources and itself .",
    "this scheme achieves higher throughput and lower delay with the cost of lower sinr as compared to @xcite . in the preliminary version of this work @xcite ,",
    "the analysis of interference at the receiving node was done asymptotically , i.e. , as the number of collaborating nodes tends to infinity . here",
    "we provide analytical expressions for symbol error probability ( sep ) that directly depend on the number of collaborating nodes .",
    "the analysis shows how sep is affected by transmission power , signal - to - noise ratio , number of simultaneously transmitting nodes and number of collaborating nodes .",
    "for simplicity , let us assume that sources and destinations are coplanar .",
    "we index source nodes using a subscript @xmath0 with @xmath1 denoting the @xmath2-th node . at slot @xmath3",
    ", one source node @xmath4 needs to transmit the signal @xmath5 to a faraway destination node @xmath6 .",
    "suppose that set of @xmath7 nodes , designated as collaborating nodes @xmath8 , have access to @xmath5 .",
    "the locations of these collaborating nodes follow a uniform distribution over a disk of radius @xmath9 .",
    "we denote the location of @xmath10 in polar coordinates with respect to the origin of the disk by @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath12 , or simply @xmath13 , represent the distance between @xmath10 and the destination @xmath6 , where @xmath14 is the azimuthal angle of @xmath6 with respect to the origin of the disk .",
    "@xmath15 or @xmath16 denotes the distance between the origin of the disk and @xmath6 , so the polar coordinates of @xmath6 are @xmath17",
    ". moreover , let @xmath18 denote the distance between @xmath10 and some receiving point with polar coordinate @xmath19 .",
    "the initial phases at the collaborating nodes are set to @xmath20 this requires knowledge of distances ( relative to wavelength @xmath21 ) between nodes and destination , and applies to the closed - loop case @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the initial phase of node @xmath2 can be @xmath22 which requires knowledge of the node s position relative to some common reference point , and corresponds to the open - loop case @xcite . in both cases synchronization",
    "is needed , which can be achieved via the use of the global positioning system ( gps ) .",
    "the path losses between collaborating nodes and destination are assumed to be identical for all nodes .",
    "the corresponding array factor given the collaborating nodes at radial coordinates @xmath23 $ ] and azimuthal coordinates @xmath24 $ ] at location with polar coordinate @xmath25 is @xmath26    under far - field assumptions , the array factor becomes @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "the random variable @xmath30 has the following probability density function ( pdf ) : @xmath31 finally , the average beampattern can be expressed as @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the first - order bessel function of the first kind .",
    "when plotted as a function of @xmath34 , @xmath35 exhibits a main lobe around @xmath14 , and side lobes away from @xmath14 .",
    "it equals one in the target direction , and the sidelobe level approaches @xmath36 as the angle moves away from the target direction .",
    "the statistical properties of the beampattern were analyzed in @xcite , where it was shown that under ideal channel and system assumptions , directivity of order @xmath7 can be achieved asymptotically with @xmath7 sparsely distributed nodes .",
    "as we have noted , all of the collaborating nodes must have the same information to implement beamforming .",
    "thus , the source nodes need to share their information symbols with all collaborating nodes in advance .",
    "if a tdma scheme were to be employed , the information - sharing time would increase proportionally to the number of source nodes . in the following ,",
    "we propose a novel scheme to reduce the information - sharing time and also allow nodes in the network to transmit simultaneously .",
    "here we refine the model of @xcite , focusing more directly on the physical model for the signal , fading channel and noise .",
    "in addition to the above assumptions , we will further assume the following :    1 .",
    "the network is divided into clusters , so that nodes in a cluster can hear each other . in each cluster",
    "there is a node designated as the cluster - head ( ch ) .",
    "nodes in a cluster do not need to transmit their packets through the ch .",
    "a slotted packet system is considered , in which each packet requires one slot for its transmission .",
    "perfect synchronization is assumed between nodes in the same cluster .",
    "nodes transmit packets consisting of phase - shift keying ( psk ) symbols each having the same power @xmath37 .",
    "also , nodes operate under half - duplex mode , i.e. , they can not receive while they are transmitting .",
    "communication takes place over flat fading channels . the channel gain during slot @xmath3 between source @xmath1 and collaborating node @xmath38",
    "is denoted by @xmath39 .",
    "it does not change within one slot , but can change between slots .",
    "the channel gains are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "complex gaussian random variables with zero means and variances @xmath40 across both time and space , i.e. , @xmath41 .",
    "the complex baseband - equivalent channel gain between nodes @xmath10 and @xmath6 is @xmath42 @xcite , where @xmath43 is the path loss .",
    "the distances between collaborating nodes and destinations are much greater than the maximum distance between source and collaborating nodes .",
    "thus , @xmath43 is assumed to be identical for all collaborating nodes and equals the path loss between the origin of the disk and the destination , denoted by @xmath44 .",
    "suppose that cluster @xmath45 contains @xmath46 nodes . during slot @xmath3 ,",
    "source nodes @xmath47 need to communicate with nodes @xmath48 that belong to clusters @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "the azimuthal angle of destination @xmath50 is denoted by @xmath51 .",
    "the packet transmitted by node @xmath52 consists of @xmath53 symbols @xmath54 $ ] . due to the broadcast nature of the wireless channel , non - source nodes in cluster @xmath45",
    "hear a collision , i.e. , a linear combination of the transmitted symbols .",
    "more specifically , node @xmath10 hears the signal @xmath55 where @xmath56 $ ] represents noise at the receiving node @xmath10 .",
    "the noise is assumed to be of zero mean and with covariance matrix @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is an @xmath59 identity matrix .",
    "once the ch establishes that there has been a transmission , it initiates a collaborative transmission period ( ctp ) , by sending a control bit to all nodes , e.g. , @xmath60 , via an error - free control channel .",
    "the ch will continue sending a @xmath60 in the beginning of each subsequent slot until the ctp has been completed .",
    "the cluster nodes can not transmit new packets until the ctp is over .",
    "let @xmath6 denote the destination of @xmath61 . in slot @xmath62 ,",
    "each collaborating node @xmath10 transmits the signal @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a scalar used to adjust the transmit power and is the same for all collaborating nodes .",
    "@xmath64 is of the order of @xmath36 .",
    "collaborating nodes need to know which are source nodes and then estimate the channel between all source nodes and themselves .",
    "one possible way to implement this is to use orthogonal ids , as discussed in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "also , collaborating nodes require the knowledge of their initial phases .",
    "in closed - loop mode , each collaborating node can independently synchronize itself to a beacon sent from the destination and adjusts its initial phase to it @xcite . in open - loop mode ,",
    "each collaborating node needs to know its relative position from a predetermined reference point ( e.g. the origin of the disk ) within the cluster , which can be achieved by the use of gps . to obtain initial phases , collaborating nodes also require knowledge of the azimuths of the destinations so that the beams can be steered toward desired directions , which may be broadcast by the ch via a control channel .",
    "given the collaborating nodes at radial coordinates @xmath23 $ ] and azimuthal coordinates @xmath24 $ ] , the received signal at an arbitrary location with polar coordinates @xmath25 , is @xmath65 where @xmath66 represents noise at the receiver during slot @xmath67 .",
    "the covariance matrix of @xmath66 equals @xmath68 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that , as @xmath69 and omitting the noise , @xmath70 .",
    "thus , the destination node @xmath6 receives a scaled version of @xmath61 .",
    "the beamforming step is completed in @xmath71 slots , reinforcing one source signal at a time .",
    "assuming that all of the @xmath71 source packets have distinct destinations at different resolvable directions , multiple beams can be formed in one slot , each beam focusing on one direction and reinforcing one source signal . in the rest of the paper , for simplicity we will consider only the case in which a single beam is formed during slot @xmath67 , focusing on destination @xmath6 .",
    "the results obtained under this assumption can be readily extended to multiple simultaneous beams .",
    "taking into account the assumptions on channels and noise , the average beampattern was derived in @xcite .",
    "defining the throughput , @xmath72 , as the average number of packets that are successfully transmitted in a time slot , we showed in @xcite that @xmath73 , which could be greater than 1 . also , in @xcite , we showed that under a fixed transmit power , the average signal - to - interference plus noise ratio ( sinr ) is asymptotically @xmath74 times less than that of @xcite , where @xmath75 .",
    "in the following , for simplicity we omit the time index , and replace @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 in the above equations by @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 ( i.e. , with one of their samples ) respectively .",
    "our analysis will be conditioned on @xmath71 , the number of simultaneously transmitting nodes . in general",

    ", @xmath71 has a binomial distribution .",
    "once the distribution of @xmath71 is given then we can determine the sep as @xmath89 .    from ( [ rec ] ) ,",
    "the received signal at the destination @xmath6 is @xmath90 where the first term is the desired signal and the remaining terms represent interference and noise .",

    "thus , under certain transmit powers , no matter how large @xmath7 is , the sep of the proposed scheme is always lower bounded by the sep under awgn .    since @xmath106 is rayleigh distributed , @xmath107 .",
