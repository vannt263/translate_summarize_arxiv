    "the study of the qcd phase diagram is a key issue in modern theoretical and experimental physics of dense matter .",
    "recent heavy - ion collision experiments at rhic brookhaven @xcite have led to the insight that the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) at high temperatures behaves as a perfect fluid with a low viscosity to entropy ratio @xmath1 @xcite which is very close to the kss bound @xcite for this number , @xmath2 .",
    "this strong deviation from the behavior of a gas of weakly interacting quarks and gluons is attributed to the occurence of mesonic bound states @xcite or resonances @xcite in the strongly coupled qgp ( sqgp ) .",
    "it has been pointed out @xcite that this situation in hot and dense qcd matter bears similarities with strongly coupled plasmas in other systems where bound state dissociation or mott - anderson delocalization @xcite occurs since the effective coupling strength is modified by electronic screening and/or pauli blocking effects .",
    "it is thus a very general effect expected to occur in a wide variety of dense fermi systems with attractive interactions @xcite .",
    "when this mott transition from truly bound to resonantly paired states occurs under conditions of bose condensation one speaks of a bec - bcs crossover @xcite .",
    "recently , this transition became accessible to laboratory experiments with ultracold gases of fermionic atoms coupled via feshbach resonances with a strength tunable by applying external magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the bec - bcs crossover transition in quark matter is of particular theoretical interest due to the additional relativistic regime it offers @xcite .",
    "theoretical concepts explaining the appearance of nonperturbative phenomena like quantum condensates and bound states in dense fermi systems with their observable consequences shall apply here but must be formulated within a quantum field theoretic approach .",
    "a systematic treatment of these effects is possible within the path integral formulation for finite - temperature quantum field theories .",
    "this approach is especially suited to take into account the effects of spontaneous symmetry breaking . here",
    "we will apply this approach on the example of a model field theory of the njl type to quark matter as a relativistic strongly interacting fermi system .",
    "it is our aim to delineate relationships between the regions of the njl model phase diagram where @xmath0sb and color superconductivity occur and the possibility to observe quasi - bound pionic states in hic experiments where hot , dense qcd matter produced in the form of rather short - lived fireballs .",
    "as a generic model system for the description of hot , dense fermi - systems with strong , short - range interactions we consider quark matter described by a model lagrangian with four - fermion coupling .",
    "the key quantity is the partition function @xmath3 from which all thermodynamic quantities can be derived . in the imaginary time formalism ( @xmath4 )",
    "it can be expressed as a path integral @xcite @xmath5 where the chemical potential @xmath6 is introduced as a lagrange multiplier for assuring conservation of baryon number .",

    "this form is suitable since it allows to obtain nonperturbative results already in the lowest orders with respect to an expansion around the stationary values of these fields . in performing this expansion , we may factorize the partition function into mean field ( mf ) , gaussian fluctuation ( gauss ) and residual ( res ) contributions @xmath31 in the following we will discuss the physical content of these approximations . in thermodynamical equilibrium ,",

    "it shifts also the border between color superconductivity ( 2sc ) and chiral symmetry broken phase ( @xmath0sb ) to lower values of the chemical potential . for very strong coupling @xmath58 , a coexistence region developes where",

    "when this mott transition occurs within the 2sc phase we speak of a bec - bcs crossover .",
    "now we discuss the interesting question of the quasiparticle excitations in these phases . to this end",
    ", we will expand the action functional in the partition function up to quadratic order in the mesonic fields and arrive at a tractable approximation for the bosonized quark matter model .",

    "the only threshold for the imaginary parts of meson decays is @xmath90 , since @xmath97 .",
    "the @xmath80 mass is always above the threshold and therefore this state is unstable in the present model .",
    "the pion , however , is a bound state until the critical temperature for the mott transition @xmath98 mev is reached . as can be seen from the slow rise of the decay width @xmath99 ,",
    "the pion is still a well - identifyable , long - lived resonance .",
    "the detailed analytic behavior of the pion at the mott transition has been discussed in the context of the njl model by hfner et al .",
    "@xcite , see also the inset of the left panel of fig .",
    "[ pion_mu000 ] .",
    "it shows strong similarities with the behavior of bound states of fermionic atoms in traps when their coupling is tuned by exploiting feshbach resonances in an external magnetic field , see @xcite . in the context of rhic experiments ,",
    "one has discussed such quasi - bound states as an explanation for the perfect liquid behavior of the sqgp @xcite .",
    "next we want to discuss the pionic excitations in the presence of a diquark condensate in the 2sc phase , see the right panel of fig .",
    "[ pion_mu000 ] .",
    "we observe the remarkable fact that the 2sc condensate stabilizes the pion at @xmath50 as a true bound state , although the pion mass exceeds by far the threshold @xmath90 .",
    "this effect is due to a compensation of gapped and ungapped quark modes and has been discussed before by ebert et al .",
    "@xcite for @xmath50 only .",
    "here we extend this study to the finite temperature case , where the pion obtains a finite width but is still a very good resonance .",
    "finally , an interesting insight can come looking at fig .",
    "[ phase_life ] . in this figure",
    "we have reported the essential phase diagram of the two - flavor quark matter in the case of coupling @xmath100 .",
    "the dashed line represents the chiral crossover line and the solid line refers to the phase transition towards 2sc phase .",
    "the dot - dashed line shows the border above which the pion turns out to be a quasi bound state in the quark plasma .",
    "the dotted line indicates the region border ( a ) below which the quasi - stable pionic states have a lifetime greater than 1 fm / c , which is a typical lifetime of fireballs . ]",
    "thus they would be measured as bound states and could be significant in the framework of hic experiments . region ( b ) confirms our claim about the absence of stable pions in a two - flavor superconductor .",
    "however this claim needs a comment .",
    "first of all , it can be easily understood how the presence of a finite diquark gap ( 2sc phase ) at t=0 stabilizes the pion .",
    "indeed as soon as the quark mass drops due to chiral symmetry restoration , the diquark gap tends to be finite and thus takes over the role of the quark mass in the dispersion relations . roughly speaking the quark start to be dressed by his interactions .",
    "thus the pion does not `` feel '' the drop of the quark mass .",
    "but as @xmath47 melts with increasing @xmath51 , the pion width @xmath101 raises , first slowly and then rapidly , reflecting the behaviour of @xmath47 as a function of t. this leads inevitably to a destabilization of the the pion states in the vicinity of the 2sc phase border .",
    "the discussion of the mesonic modes in the 2sc phase points to a very rich spectrum of excitations which eventually leads to specific new observable signals of this hypothetical phase .",
    "the cbm experiment planned at fair darmstadt and the nica project at jinr dubna could be capable of creating thermodynamical conditions for the observation of these excitations in the experiment",
    ". one promising signal could be the scalar resonance in the pion - pion scattering at the two - pion threshold which is in principle observable , e.g. , in the two - photon decay channel @xcite .",
    "however , the description of this state goes beyond the gaussian approximation to which we restrict ourselves in this work .",
    "in this work we have derived and evaluated the gap equations and the scalar - pseudoscalar meson spectra within a path integral approach to the two - flavor njl type model of superconducting quark matter .",
    "after fixing the parameters of the model to the light meson spectrum in the vacuum , the diquark coupling remains as a free parameter which has been used to extend the model beyond the traditional range of applications into the region of bec - bcs crossover .",
    "we have presented the phase diagram of quark matter at strong and very strong coupling .",
    "the origin of the bec - bcs crossover in superconducting quark matter is the mott transition for diquark bound states .",
    "we explain the physics of the mott transition on the example of mesonic correlations . we have investigated the meson spectra ( bound and scattering states ) outside ( @xmath102 ) and for the first time also inside ( @xmath103 ) the color superconductivity region .",
    "we find the thresholds for the dissociation of pionic bound states into unbound , but resonant scattering states in the quark - antiquark continuum and we have shown that outside the @xmath0sb region where the pion is a zero - width bound state , there are two regions where it can be considered as a quasi - bound state with a lifetime exceeding that of a typical heavy - ion collision fireball : ( a ) the high - temperature @xmath0sb crossover region at low densities and ( b ) the high - density color superconducting phase at temperatures below 100 mev .",
