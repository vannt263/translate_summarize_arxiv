    "addition of small amount of salt to a binary mixture near a demixing critical point can significantly change its properties . when inorganic salt is added to water and organic liquid",
    ", the two - phase region enlarges  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , antagonistic ( or amphiphilic ) salt added to such mixture leads to shrinking of the two phase region ; it can even disappear when the amount of salt is large enough @xcite .",
    "in addition , in the case of the antagonistic salt a peak in the structure factor for the wavenumber @xmath2 was observed in the one - phase region  @xcite .",
    "the peak indicates thermodynamically stable inhomogeneities on the length scale @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "moreover , in a few cases a lamellar phase was observed for some region of the phase diagram @xcite . for low salt concentration",
    "the shape of the structure factor was described with a good accuracy by the formula obtained by onuki and kitamura @xcite . for larger amount of salt ( when the two - phase region disappears )",
    "the experimental structure factor was described with better accuracy by the formula derived earlier for bicontinuous microemulsion or sponge phases  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the structure factor of the lamellar phase was fitted with a good accuracy  @xcite by the formula developed for a stack of membranes @xcite .",
    "these observations strongly suggest that the key features of the mesoscopic structure do not depend on whether antagonistic salt or surfactant is added to a mixture of inorganic and organic solvents . in this work",
    "we address the question of the above similarity on a theoretical level by comparing the landau - type functionals for the two systems . for this purpose",
    "we first develop a landau - type functional starting from a microscopic density functional theory and using the same coarse - graining procedure as used earlier for the hydrophilic salt  @xcite . in the next step",
    "we verify under what conditions the brazovskii functional of the solvent concentration , developed earlier for amphiphilic systems  @xcite can be obtained .",
    "the effects of confinement on the near - critical mixture with antagonistic salt were not investigated experimentally yet .",
    "theoretical investigations based on the theory of onuki and kitamura  @xcite focused very briefly on colloid particles immersed in the critical mixture with salt  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the effective potentials between a flat substrate and a colloid particle immersed in the critical mixture with hydrophilic salt , and between two particles in such mixture were measured in several impressive experiments @xcite .",
    "similarity between the structure factors in the investigated system and sponge phases suggests that an oscillatory force between confining surfaces , observed experimentally for surfactant mixtures @xcite , could occur in a presence of antagonistic salt too .",
    "the effective potential between surfaces confining the critical mixture with ions is interesting from both the fundamental and the practical point of view .",
    "surfaces with similar adsorption preferences attract each other , while surfaces with different adsorption preferences repel each other  @xcite when the confined fluid is near its critical point .",
    "the range of this so called thermodynamic casimir potential @xcite is equal to the bulk correlation length @xmath4 with @xmath5 , and becomes macroscopic when the critical temperature @xmath6 is approached .",
    "when the surfaces are charged , then depending on the surface charges electrostatic repulsion or attraction is added to the casimir potential .",
    "the resulting potential can have a minimum or a maximum , depending on the ratio between @xmath7 and the screening length @xmath8 . by changing the salt concentration and the temperature , one can change @xmath8 and @xmath7 , and tune the shape of the potential between the surfaces , e.g. the surfaces of particles @xcite .",
    "temperature can be changed in a reversible manner , and reversible structural changes can be induced @xcite . in particular ,",
    "when the effective potential has a minimum , then analogs of the gas - liquid and liquid - solid transitions between the particles were observed  @xcite .",
    "the experimental results for inorganic salt show that the effective potential can not be described by just a sum of the casimir and the electrostatic potential @xcite . in particular ,",
    "attraction was measured for some temperature range between like charge hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces  @xcite , whereas both the casimir and the electrostatic potentials are repulsive in this case . both potentials , however , can be modified because of different solubility of the ions in the two components of the solvent . for this reason quite different behavior of the effective potential between charged and selective surfaces",
    "can be expected for the antagonistic salt  @xcite , and we address this question here .",
    "several groups tried to explain the experiment in ref .",
    "the attraction for a range of temperatures was obtained in two different approaches . the first one is based on the theory of onuki and kitamura  @xcite .",
    "the attraction appears when the solubility in water of the anion and the cation differ significantly from each other and the hydrophobic surface is neutral  @xcite . on the other hand , in the theory developed in ref.@xcite for hydrophilic ions , the concentration profile near the charged hydrophobic surface can be nonmonotonic , because the attraction of the organic particles competes with the attraction of the hydrated ions  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath9 , excess of water may appear at some distance from the surface , therefore it may act as a hydrophilic one .",
    "the shapes of the effective potential for different temperatures in this theory are quite similar to the experimental curves , but the fitting was not attempted yet  @xcite .",
    "importantly , good quantitative agreement between this theory and the experiments conducted for @xmath10  @xcite was obtained in ref.@xcite , in contrast to the theories based on the onuki and kitamura functional . in this work",
    "we develop a landau - type theory for the antagonistic salt following the same strategy as in ref.@xcite .    in the onuki and kitamura model the critical binary mixture",
    "is described by the phenomoenological landau functional of the concentration @xmath11 .",
    "the ions are treated as a two - component ideal gas whose particles interact with the coulomb potential , and the corresponding entropy and electrostatic energy are added to the landau functional .",
    "finally , the coupling between the critical mixture and the ions of the form @xmath12 is added , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the density and the preferential salvation of the @xmath15-th ion .",
    "note that in this model the van der waals interactions between the ions are neglected , and the entropy of the four - component mixture is approximated by a sum of the entropy of the two two - component subsystems .",
    "for this reason the coupling between the two subsystems beyond the above bilinear term is not taken into account .",
    "the full microscopic density - functional theory of a four - component mixture is more accurate and justified than a phenomenological model , but in practice it is too difficult .",
    "moreover , such a detailed description is not necessary when the characteristic length scales are mesoscopic . on the other hand ,",
    "a microscopic theory is a good starting point for a derivation of the landau - type functional by a coarse - graining procedure .",
    "such a strategy was successful in the case of the hydrophilic salt @xcite . in the next section",
    "we develop in the same way a landau - type functional for the antagonistic salt added to the near - critical binary solvent . in sec.3",
    "we focus on the disordered phase in the bulk .",
    "we calculate the correlation function , and compare our functional with the landau - brazovskii functional for microemulsions .",
    "in sec.4 we consider the concentration and charge profiles in a semiinfinite system and in a slit , and calculate the effective potential between the surfaces . in sec.5",
    "a comparison of the structure factor with the experimental results reported in ref.@xcite is performed . for the model parameters obtained from the fitting of the structure factor to the experimental results",
    "the concentration profiles and the effective potential are computed .",
    "sec.6 contains summary and discussion .",
    "in particular , we compare the effective potential obtained in the models for the hydrophilic and the antagonistic salt .",
    "we consider a four - component mixture containing water , organic liquid and antagonistic salt which has hydrophilic cations and hydrophobic anions .",
    "the fluid is in contact with a reservoir with fixed temperature and chemical potential of all the components . in equilibrium",
    "the distribution of the components corresponds to the minimum of the grand potential @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are pressure , volume and entropy respectively , and @xmath20 , @xmath21 are the electrostatic and the van der waals contributions to the internal energy . @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the local number density and the chemical potential of the @xmath15-th component respectively , with @xmath24 corresponding to water and organic solvent ( for example lutidine or methylpyridine ) , and @xmath25 corresponding to the cations and the anions .",
    "we consider dimensionless distance @xmath26 and dimensionless densities , i.e. the length is measured in units of @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the average volume per particle in the liquid phase , and @xmath30 denotes the number of the @xmath15-th kind particles in the volume @xmath18 .",
    "we neglect compressibility of the liquid and assume that the total density is fixed , @xmath31 the microscopic details , in particular different sizes of molecules are disregarded , since we are interested in the local densities in the regions much larger than @xmath27 . to simplify the notation we shall omit the asterisk for the dimensionless distance .",
    "the electrostatic energy is given by @xcite @xmath32,\\\\\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the electrostatic potential which satisfies the poisson equation ( note that the length @xmath34 and density are dimensionless ) @xmath35 we neglect the dependence of the dielectric constant @xmath36 on the solvent concentration ( @xcite ) .",

    "+ we assume the usual form of the internal energy @xmath40 , @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the vdw interaction and the pair correlation function between the corresponding components respectively .",
    "the very complex expression for @xmath40 can be approximated by a much simpler form in systems with particular properties of @xmath42 , and in special thermodynamic states , such as the neighborhood of the critical point .",
    "close to the critical point and for small amount of ions the correlation and screening lengths are large , and the local densities vary slowly on the microscopic length scale .",
    "thus , the density @xmath44 can be taylor expanded about @xmath45 . in the case of attractive interactions the expansion can be truncated at the second - order therm  @xcite . as a result , @xmath40 is given by a single integral over @xmath45 with the integrand depending on the densities and their gradients at @xmath45 , and on the zeroth , @xmath46 , and the second , @xmath47 , moments of @xmath48  @xcite . since we consider two inorganic ( water and cation ) and two organic ( metylpyridine and anion ) components , we can further simplify the expression for @xmath21 by assuming appropriate relations between @xmath49 .",
    "we assume that the differences between the interactions of all the inorganic components are negligible ; likewise , we neglect the differences between the interactions of all the organic components .",

    "for this reason @xmath67 can be easily expressed in terms of @xmath66 and @xmath37 with the help of the equation @xmath69 ( see appendix a ) , and the grand potential becomes a functional of two fields , @xmath66 and @xmath70 .",

    "we should note that our theory is similar to the theory developed by onuki and kitamura  @xcite and studied in ref.@xcite .",

    "we take into account the van der waals interactions between the ions , and consider the entropy of the four - component mixture , instead of a sum of the entropies of the two 2-component subsystems .",
    "important advantage of our approach is the link between the mesoscopic and the microscopic description that was a starting point of our derivation .",
    "thanks to this link our theory is justified on a more fundamental level . however , in the case of the antagonistic salt the difference between our theory and the theory of onuki and kitamura is less significant than in the case of the inorganic salt . in the latter case",
    "the nonlinear coupling between @xmath63 and @xmath64 plays a crucial role in our theory , and is ignored in ref.@xcite .",
    "the effect of very small amount of solute should be independent of its kind .",

    "nevertheless , we have verified that for small amount of ions and not very close to the critical point ( for example for @xmath278 and @xmath279 ) the effective potential between parallel external surfaces has essentially the same form for the inorganic and antagonistic salt . for larger @xmath76 a quantitative difference between @xmath263 in the presence of the inorganic or the antagonistic salt",
    "can be seen ( fig.[pot.11 ] ) .",
    "qualitatively different shapes of @xmath263 are obtained if the correlation length is sufficiently large compared to the period of the concentration oscillations .",
    "the same amount of antagonistic salt leads to a deeper minimum of the effective potential at shorter separation than in the case of the inorganic salt , and the repulsion barrier occurs .",
    "this shape of the potential may occur when @xmath76 is big enough , and the critical point is approached ( fig.[pot.11 ] ) .",

    "a functional of the same form was successfully applied to amphiphilic systems @xcite .",
    "thus , our theoretical result and the experimental observations of similarity between the mesoscopic structure induced by amphiphiles and antagonistic salt @xcite are complementary .",
    "we have limited to the gaussian approximation here .",
    "it is well known that beyond the gaussian approximation the fluctuations with the wavelength @xmath143 yield a significant contribution to the correlation function , especially close to @xmath141 .",
    "the @xmath97-dependence , however , is not changed up to a small correction ; only @xmath144 is renormalized in the 1-loop approximation .",
    "we fitted our expression for @xmath112 to the experimental curves . since the decay of the op and the shape of the effective potential",
    "are determined by the correlation function , in our results for @xmath280 the renormalization of the model parameters is partially taken into account . this way we avoid the overestimation of the mesoscopic structure typical for the men - field results .",
    "we have calculated the effective potential for 4 samples investigated experimentally in ref.@xcite .",
    "the maximum of the structure factor occurs for @xmath113 for three of these samples .",
    "the oscillatory concentration and effective potential can be seen only in the sample with the largest concentration of ions , however .",
    "this is because the period of oscillations , @xmath281 is large compared to the decay length @xmath282 ( table i ) , whereas a detectable oscillatory potential can be expected for @xmath283 .",
    "based on our results ( fig.[opsadakane ] ) and on the analogy with surfactant mixtures where such forces were measured  @xcite , we may expect oscillatory effective potential between the confining surfaces closer to the critical point or near the transition to the lamellar phase .",
