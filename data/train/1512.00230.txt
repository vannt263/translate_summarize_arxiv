    "in 1986 haider and liu  @xcite , based on the coupled - channel analysis of the @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 reactions  @xcite , postulated the existence of @xmath1-mesic nuclei in which the @xmath1 meson is bound within a nucleus via the strong interaction .",
    "since then , the search for @xmath1- and @xmath8-mesic bound states was performed in many laboratories as e.g. : cosy  @xcite , elsa  @xcite , gsi  @xcite , jinr  @xcite , jparc  @xcite , lpi  @xcite , and mami  @xcite , however , till now none of the experiments confirmed its existence .",
    "the status of the search was recently described in the following reviews  @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical studies e.g.  @xcite support the search for @xmath1 and @xmath8-mesic nuclei .",
    "phenomenological and theoretical investigations of @xmath1 production in hadronic- and photo- induced reactions result in a wide range of possible scattering lengths from @xmath9  fm to @xmath10  fm  @xcite , which do not exclude the formation of a bound states for the helium  @xcite and even the deuteron  @xcite .",
    "the observation of an steep rise in the total cross - section of the and @xmath2 @xmath11 reactions close to the kinematic threshold  @xcite , gives a strong evidence for the existence of a bound state .",
    "similar observations were carried out in case of the cross section for the photoproduction process @xmath12 @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "it shows that the rise of the cross section above threshold is independent of the initial channel giving a strong argument for the existence of the pole in the scattering matrix which could be associated with a bound state .",
    "therefore , we consider the @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath14-@xmath1 as a good candidates for the @xmath1-mesic bound states",
    ".    the discovery of postulated @xmath1-mesic nuclei would be interesting on its own as well as would be very important for ( i ) better understanding of the @xmath1 and @xmath8 meson properties  @xcite and their interaction with nucleons inside nuclear matter , ( ii ) providing information about the @xmath15(1535 ) resonance  @xcite and ( vi ) about flavour singlet component of the quark - gluon wave function of the @xmath1 and @xmath8 mesons  @xcite .",
    "we performed the search for the @xmath0-@xmath1 bound state with unique accuracy with the wasa facility , installed at the cosy synchrotron in forschungszentrum jlich ( germany ) .",
    "the advantage of this detection system is the possibility of a simultaneous measurement of all ejectiles with high acceptance while continuously changing the beam momentum around the @xmath1 production threshold .",
    "the signature of the nuclei is searched for by studying the excitation function for the chosen decay channels of the system , formed in deuteron - deuteron collision  @xcite .  till",
    "now two experiments were carried out focusing on the bound state decay into @xmath14 and a nucleon - pion pair  @xcite .",
    "the first experiment was carried out in june 2008 , by measuring the excitation function of the @xmath2 @xmath4 reaction near the @xmath1 production threshold covering the excess energy range from -51.4  mev up to 22 mev . in the excitation function no structure which could be interpreted as a resonance originating from decay of the @xmath1-mesic @xmath0",
    "was observed . the upper limit of the total cross - section for the bound state formation and decay in the process was determined and varies from 20 nb to 27 nb at the confidence level 90%  @xcite .",
    "in the second experiment , in november 2010 , about 10 times higher statistics were collected with respect to the previous measurement .",
    "the search for the @xmath0-@xmath1 bound state was performed for two reactions @xmath2 @xmath3 and @xmath2 @xmath4 via the measurement of the excitation function for each of them in the vicinity of the @xmath1 production threshold .",
    "the deuteron beam momentum was varying continuously within each acceleration cycle from 2.127  gev / c to 2.422  gev / c , crossing the kinematic threshold for the @xmath1 production in the @xmath16 @xmath11 reaction at 2.336  gev / c , which corresponds to a range of excess energy .    here",
    "we show result for the channel @xmath2 @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath14 was identified in the forward detector based on the .",
    "the neutral pion @xmath17 was reconstructed in the central detector from the invariant mass of two gamma quanta originating from its decay while the neutron was identified via the missing mass technique .",
    "events corresponding to the bound states production were selected by applying cuts in the @xmath14 center of mass ( cm ) momentum , nucleon cm kinetic energy , pion cm kinetic energy and the opening angle between neutron - pion pair in the cm based on monte carlo simulations .",
    "the excitation functions for the reaction were determined for a region rich in signal corresponding to momenta of the @xmath14 in the cm system in range .",
    "the excitation function was obtained by normalizing the events selected in individual excess energy intervals by the corresponding integrated luminosities ( the detailed description of the luminosity determination one can find in ref .",

    "therefore , the upper limit of the total cross section for the @xmath18-@xmath19 @xmath3 process was determined on the 90% confidence level . for this purpose",
    "the excitation function was fitted with a quadratic function describing the background combined with the breit - wigner function which can describe the signal from the bound state . in performing the fit ,",
    "the binding energy and the bound state width are fixed parameters while the polynomial coefficients and the amplitude of the breit - wigner distribution are treated as free parameters .",
    "the fitting procedure was performed for various values of binding energy and width .",
    "an example of the fit for @xmath20  mev and @xmath21  mev is presented in fig .",
    "the upper limit of the total cross section for considered process varies from 21 to 36  nb for the bound state width ranging from 5 to 50  mev , while the systematic error varies from 12% to 27% ( see fig .",
    "the performed analysis allows for the determination of the excitation function for @xmath18-@xmath19 @xmath3 process and the estimation of the upper limit of the cross section for the @xmath1-mesic @xmath0 formation and decay .",
    "the obtained excitation function does not show any narrow structure which could be a signature of the bound state with width less than 50  mev .",
    "the upper limit is by a factor of five larger than theoretically predicted value  @xcite therefore , the current measurement does not exclude the existence of bound state in this process .",
