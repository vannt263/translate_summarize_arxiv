    "quarks and gluons are believed to lose energy while traversing the strongly interacting hot and dense matter produced in relativistic heavy - ion collisions , leading to a significant softening and broadening of the jets , also known as the phenomenon of jet - quenching .",
    "energy loss of high-@xmath6 partons manifests itself in the suppression of the particle production at high-@xmath6 in nucleus - nucleus collisions , compared to expectations from binary scaled @xmath1+@xmath1 results .",
    "the amount of suppression and its transverse momentum dependence reflect the opacity of the medium .",
    "the medium - induced effects on particle production are quantified with the nuclear modification factor : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the differential yields per event in nucleus - nucleus and p+p collisions , respectively , and @xmath10 is the number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions averaged over the impact parameter range of the corresponding centrality .",
    "the studies of hadron production in @xmath1+@xmath1 , @xmath2+au and au+au collisions in the first three runs of rhic allowed to establish that ( i ) neutral pions at high-@xmath6 are strongly suppressed in central au+au collisions @xcite , ( ii ) no suppression is observed at high-@xmath6 for direct photons in au+au collisions @xcite and ( iii ) for inclusive and identified hadrons in @xmath2+au collisions @xcite .",
    "contrary to the strong suppression of neutral pions , protons show a very different binary - collision scaling behavior from that of pions in au+au collisions @xcite .",
    "the proton production is enhanced at intermediate @xmath11  2 - 5  gev/@xmath12 compared to scaled @xmath1+@xmath1 results .",
    "the measurements by the star collaboration indicate that at high @xmath6 the nuclear modification factor of protons becomes similar to that of pions @xcite and also that the r@xmath13 patterns for @xmath14 and @xmath15 mesons are different from that of the @xmath16 baryon ( note that @xmath17 ) @xcite .",
    "further studies of identified hadron production reveal that despite a factor of about 4 difference in mass , @xmath18 mesons follow the suppression pattern of neutral pions over the entire @xmath6 range of the measurements @xcite .",
    "the latter suggests that the differences in the behavior of baryons and mesons are not related to the difference in their mass but rather to the number of constituent quarks .",
    "the @xmath0-meson , with a mass comparable to that of the proton and @xmath19 baryon , but carrying two quarks , differentiates between hadron mass and number of constituent quark effects .",
    "moreover , being an almost pure @xmath20 state , it provides insight on the effects of flavour composition on the hadron suppression pattern .",
    "the @xmath21 results presented in this contribution were obtained from the data samples accumulated by the phenix experiment @xcite during @xmath1+@xmath1 , @xmath2+au , cu+cu and au+au collisions at @xmath3  gev in the 2003 - 2005 physics runs . charged particle tracking and measurements of their momentum are accomplished by the high - resolution multi - wire proportional drift chambers ( dc ) and the first layer of the pad chambers ( pc1 ) .",
    "the typical value of the momentum resolution is @xmath22 .",
    "charged particle identification ( pid ) is based on the particle mass calculated from the momentum and the time - of - flight information derived from the time of flight ( tof ) detector or the lead scintillator ( pbsc ) part of the electro magnetic calorimeter and the beam beam counters ( bbc s ) . the tof subsystem with a time resolution @xmath23 @xmath24 120  ps and the pbsc with @xmath23 @xmath24 500  ps allow to achieve reliable pion - kaon separation in the @xmath6 ranges @xmath25  gev/@xmath12 and @xmath26  gev/@xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the zero degree calorimeters ( zdc s ) and bbc s are dedicated subsystems that determine the collision vertex and event centrality and also provide the minimum bias ( mb ) interaction trigger .",
    "the mb trigger used for @xmath1+@xmath1 , @xmath2+au and cu+cu collisions requires a coincidence between the bbc s with at least one hit in each bbc arm . for au+au collisions",
    "the mb trigger requires a coincidence between the bbc s and zdc s with at least two hits in each bbc arm , and at least one neutron detected in each zdc arm .",
    "all events used in the analysis are required to have the collision vertex position along the beam axis within 30 cm of the geometrical center of phenix .",
    "there are three different techniques that were used for the @xmath21 mass reconstruction .",
    "the first ( `` no pid '' ) does not require identification of charged tracks in the final state and assumes that all tracks are kaons .",
    "the second ( `` one kaon pid '' ) requires identification of only one kaon in the tof . in the third technique",
    "( `` two kaons pid '' ) both kaons are identified in the tof or the pbsc ; four different subsystem combinations have been considered : tof - tof , tof - pbsc@xmath27 , pbsc@xmath27-pbsc@xmath27 , pbsc@xmath28-pbsc@xmath28 .",
    "the @xmath2+au data were analyzed using `` no pid '' , @xmath1+@xmath1 and cu+cu using `` no pid '' and `` one kaon pid '' , and au+au using `` no pid '' and `` two kaons pid '' . combining the results obtained with complimentary techniques the @xmath6 range accessible for the @xmath0 measurements extends from @xmath291  gev/@xmath12 to 7  gev/@xmath12 ( to 5.1  gev/@xmath12 in @xmath2+au ) .",
    "the three analysis techniques have very different sources of systematic uncertainties and provide a valuable consistency check . in every technique all kaon candidates from each event passing the track selection requirements are combined into unlike - sign pairs . the invariant mass and the transverse momentum for each pair is then calculated based on the 2-body decay kinematics .",
    "the resulting mass distributions contain both the @xmath0-meson signal and an inherent combinatorial background .",
    "the combinatorial background is estimated either by simultaneously fitting the mass distribution to the sum of a breit - wigner function to account for the signal , convoluted with gaussian to account for the mass resolution , and a polynomial function to account for the background , or by an event - mixing technique described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the raw yields are extracted by integrating the invariant mass distributions in the vicinity of the pdg value of the @xmath0-meson mass ( 1.019  gev/@xmath30 ) after subtracting the combinatorial background .",
    "corrections to the raw yields for the limited detector acceptance and resolution , reconstruction and trigger efficiency , multiplicity effects and various analysis cuts are determined from the full single - particle monte carlo simulation and analysis of the data .",
