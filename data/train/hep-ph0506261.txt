    "spacetime supersymmetry ( susy ) has become one of the leading candidate extensions to the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics  @xcite . besides the aesthetic appeal of maximally extending the poincar group  @xcite , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )",
    "also provides a natural weakly - interacting dark matter candidate , a solution to the higgs sector naturalness problem , and likely unification of gauge couplings near the planck scale , among other features .",
    "if susy exists , it must be a broken symmetry at low energy , as we do not observe the opposite - spin - statistics partners of the sm field content which would necessarily exist . as a result",
    ", the squarks , sleptons , charginos and neutralinos of the mssm must be fairly massive in comparison to their sm counterparts .",
    "previous high - energy physics experiments such as lep and run  i of the tevatron have put stringent bounds on some of the sparticle masses .",
    "it will fall to the cern lhc proton - proton collider to perform a conclusive susy search , although the real physics would only begin were a potential susy discovery to be made .",
    "if lhc finds candidate susy particles , a great deal of work would be required to prove or disprove the hypothesis that the new particle content belongs to the susy partner spectrum of the sm content , and if confirmed to perform a sufficient number of measurements to determine the parameters of the susy lagrangian  @xcite . for the lhc",
    "the prospects of undertaking both tasks is uncertain , since many of the weakly - interacting spartners might go unobserved , and many of the colored spartners would have overlapping signatures ; disentangling these would be a daunting prospect .",
    "the lhc will also be hard pressed to measure sparticle masses : for some , only mass differences may be accessible  @xcite . performing such tasks as measuring the spins of new state , or confirming that their couplings are indeed identical to the gauge and yukawa couplings of the sm , is largely unexplored territory phenomenologically .",
    "ideally , a future linear collider ( ilc ) will be constructed which could address many of these precision measurement problems  @xcite , and there is considerable effort to understand the synergy that would exist between lhc and ilc  @xcite .",
    "however , there is also now the planned luminosity upgrade to lhc , the slhc  @xcite . while it certainly wo nt be able to bring about a precision - era of physics and guarantee disentanglement of whatever new physics is found at lhc ,",
    "our goal here is to explore just how far lhc and slhc could push the envelope in measurements of the new physics .",
    "susy phenomenology at lhc has so far focused mainly on the dominant @xmath3 processes , which for colored sparticles is qcd production of gluino pairs , same - flavor squark pairs , and mixed gluino - squark pairs .",
    "these production channels probe only the susy - qcd vertices .",
    "while the sparticle cascade decays will necessarily involve weak - interaction vertices , the actual measurement is the number of events resulting from the production cross section times branching ratio ( br ) to a given final state .",
    "this alone is not enough information to separate the different vertices .   of the br . ]",
    "analogous to the case of single - top production in the sm  @xcite , observing mixed - flavor squark production , which occurs via the weak vertex @xmath0-@xmath4-@xmath5 and semi - weak vertex @xmath0-@xmath6-@xmath4-@xmath5 , would add additional information about the sparticle interaction vertices .",
    "note that the weak interaction , being left - handed , involves only the left - handed squark partners of the quarks .",
    "in fact , assuming that the various sparticle brs were determined in qcd pair production , mixed - flavor production would then provide absolute measurements of the weak vertex couplings .",
    "weak production processes are navely approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than qcd production processes - although this also depends on the relative mass spectrum with respect to which parton luminosity dominates for that regime of @xmath7 .",
    "this would present a problem for identifying this mixed - flavor signal .",
    "there is some hope , however . in maximally - unifying scenarios , a.k.a .",
    "`` gut - inspired '' , over much of parameter space the colorless sparticles would be lighter than the colored sparticles . the cascade decay chains of squarks would typically therefore proceed ultimately through the lightest slepton ( almost always a stau in popular unifying scenarios ) or lightest chargino , in either case giving a final - state lepton   boson plus lsp .",
    "this scenario in general presents problems for susy analyses in disentangling production processes . ] .",
    "mixed - flavor production often preferentially gives same - sign leptons in the final state , compared to opposite - sign leptons from qcd pair production . since the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite detectors at lhc will be able to identify lepton charge sign to better than @xmath8 accuracy , this characteristic of weak mixed - flavor production could provide a separation from the much greater rate of qcd production events .",
    "our physics goal is to find and exploit characteristics of mixed - flavor squark production which would make these weak cross sections stand out against the much larger qcd squark production processes , providing a way to measure the weak vertices .",
    "the best hope to look for mixed - flavor squark production is in the third generation , i.e. top and bottom squarks .",
    "the reasons for this are threefold .",
    "first , the largest first- and second - generation squark pair production mechanism at lhc is typically @xmath9 , which proceeds via a @xmath10-channel majorana gluino and dominates over squark - antisquark production because of the very high initial - state valence @xmath11 quark luminosity .",
    "this state would decay predominately to same - sign leptons via @xmath12 , with the pair of lightest charginos , @xmath13 , decaying to same - sign leptons .",
    "second , the first- and second - generation squarks are impossible to cleanly separate from each other and from gluino pair and gluino - squark production , due to the inability to tag light flavors . tagging the @xmath14 jets in stop - sbottom mixed pairs would eliminate the first- and second - generation squark contributions , up to the level of fake @xmath14 tag rates .",
    "third , because gluinos are majorana , their decay chains give equal probability for either fermion sign  @xcite . as a result , gluino pairs and squark - gluino production would be large sources of same - sign leptons .",
    "tagging @xmath14 jets can likewise reduce this fake source of same - sign leptons , except that , depending on the spectrum , gluinos may decay into stops or sbottoms themselves .",
    "we will come back to these issues later as background considerations .",
    "for the third generation , the left- and right - handed squarks @xmath4 , @xmath15 can mix , forming mass eigenstates @xmath16 , @xmath17 , with @xmath16 defined as lighter .",
    "the mixing is proportional to the yukawa couplings of the sm fermions .",
    "the general mass matrix for stops is given by : m_^2 & = & (    cc m__l^2 & + m_t ( a_t^ * - ) + + m_t ( a_t - ^ * ) & m__r^2    ) [ eq : sqmass ] where @xmath18 is the ratio of higgs sector vacuum expectation values @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the higgsino mass parameter , @xmath21 is the top squark trilinear scalar coupling in the soft susy breaking potential , and m__l^2 & = & m__l^2 + m^2_z 2 ( i_3 t - s^2_w q_t ) + m^2_t , [ eq : sq_diagonal_left ] + m__r^2 & = & m__r^2 + m^2_z 2 s^2_w q_t + m^2_t .",
    "[ eq : sq_diagonal_right ] where @xmath22 , @xmath23 are the soft - breaking masses in the susy lagrangian . for @xmath14 instead of @xmath10 , replace @xmath24 with @xmath18 . because of this @xmath25-@xmath26 mixing in the third generation , the susy weak vertices @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 are more complicated than the corresponding @xmath0-@xmath10-@xmath14 vertex in the sm : they contain not just the super - ckm angle @xmath27 , but also the mixing angles of the stops and sbottoms , which reflect the left - handed component of each squark .",
    "expressed in terms of reduced parameters , the @xmath0-@xmath28-@xmath29 coupling is @xmath30 , where the mixing angles are those that diagonalize eq .  [ eq : sqmass ] for stop and sbottom squarks , respectively . for @xmath17 instead of @xmath16 ,",
    "@xmath31 is replaced by @xmath32 to obtain the left - handed component .",
    "if susy were an exact symmetry , @xmath33 .",
    "this is a very good approximation even after susy breaking and evolution down to the electroweak scale  @xcite , although it can be altered if susy breaking is not flavor - blind .    as in sm single - top production , there are three ways to produce mixed - flavor squarks at lhc : @xmath34-channel , @xmath10-channel , and @xmath0-associated production .",
    "the first two are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : s - prod ] and  [ fig : t - prod ] , respectively .",
    "the third is typically about 1/3 of the @xmath10-channel rate , but would be likely be experimentally indistinct from qcd sbottom pair production .",
    "we will therefore ignore this channel .",
    "the analogy to sm single - top production is not complete , since in the sm case the light @xmath14 quark mass allows it to be treated as an initial - state parton , which can not happen here .",
    "the sm process also involves only one heavy state , whereas here we have two , leading to different kinematics . finally , in the susy case , because the squarks are scalars , there is a four - point vertex which does not exist in the sm . although the graphs of fig .  [ fig : t - prod ] are part of the real - emission qcd corrections to the basic process of fig .  [",
    "fig : s - prod ] , they behave very differently . as we will see , the @xmath10-channel cross sections are always much larger than the @xmath34-channel .",
    "this is a combination of the larger suppression from an @xmath34-channel propagator at large squark pair invariant mass , and initial - state gluon versus sea quark luminosity .    to calculate cross sections , we use matrix elements generated by a new mssm version of madgraph  @xcite , called smadgraph  @xcite .",
    "our calculations utilize cteq6l1 structure functions  @xcite for the incoming protons at lhc , @xmath35  tev , and we choose the average of the two final - state squark masses as the factorization and renormalization scales .",
    "we begin by analyzing the cross sections for the mssm parameter space benchmark point   sps1a  @xcite .",
    "for this point , the squark masses are @xmath36  gev and @xmath37  gev .",
    "as seen in table  [ tab : sps1a ] , the lo total cross sections for sps1a are typically quite small , on the order of a few fb , although even this would produce many hundreds of events for the planned luminosity of 300  fb@xmath38 per experiment at the lhc , or thousands of events for the 3000  fb@xmath38 per experiment for the planned luminosity upgrade to the lhc , the slhc  @xcite    -channel @xmath39 production at a hadron collider . ]",
    "-channel @xmath40 production at a hadron collider .",
    "the dot highlights the weak vertex to be measured . ]",
    ".cross sections [ fb ] for mixed stop - sbottom production at lhc at mssm benchmark point sps1a . for the @xmath10-channel results",
    ", we do not impose a kinematic cut on the final - state quark . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     because of the anticipated large detection efficiency for long - lived staus , about a factor 5 over staus which would promptly decay to taus , our rough estimate of observability here will be for the lhc already , rather than the slhc . using a jet veto strategy",
    "we would anticipate approximately 620 double-@xmath14-tagged signal events ( including hadronic top decay ) , on top of a total background of about 400 events ; s / b would be better than 1/1 .",
    "this would provide for a remarkable @xmath41 detection and statistical uncertainty on the signal cross section to this final state of about @xmath42 . even if the background rejection factors due to @xmath0 or jet veto turn out to be off by an order of magnitude , this would still allow for a @xmath43 observation and up to an @xmath44 statistical uncertainty on the cross section .",
    "needless to say , at slhc this channel would rapidly become dominated by systematic errors , such as the qcd uncertainty on the signal theoretical cross section or the measurement of the @xmath45 rate and its brs . however , because the dominant background is likely this squark pair rather than squark+gluino production , there is an additional handle one could apply to improve the situation : the signal has an approximately 2:1 asymmetry for ( + + ) v. ( @xmath46 ) production , due to the predominance of initial - state valence @xmath11 over valence @xmath47 partons .",
    "qcd sbottom pair production is totally symmetric , in contrast .",
    "thus , by measuring the charge asymmetry of the final state , [ eq : asym ] a = , one could gain additional strong leverage over residual systematic uncertainty of the qcd background .",
    "a particularly interesting scenario is gauge - mediated susy breaking ( gmsb ) , which has a gravitino lsp . because the decay of the nlsp would be of gravitational strength , the nlsp is typically long - lived , and if charged would be extraordinarily noticeable in experiment as a heavy charged object passing through the muon chambers . because of this , the efficiency to detect susy events would be very close to @xmath48 if the nlsp is charged , completely eliminating sm backgrounds and retaining nearly the whole rate of stop - sbottom pairs , modulo the efficiency for @xmath14-tagging , needed to identify that the susy signal comes from third - generation squarks .",
    "sps7 is a gmsb scenario with stau nlsp , but because of the very large stop and sbottom masses , there is practically no rate for mixed - flavor pairs at lhc .",
    "we instead look for parameterizations of gmsb where the stops and sbottoms are light enough to be produced at the lhc , and also where the gluino is slightly lighter than the sbottoms , so that the br(@xmath49 ) does not dominate .",
    "susy backgrounds are then composed only of light squarks and gluinos which decay to same - sign staus , with light jets mistagged as @xmath14 jets .",
    "the large suppression of such fakes may make such a scenario feasible for much smaller signal cross sections than in sps1a or sps5 .",
    "we easily find an example of such a parameterization , by choosing @xmath50  tev , @xmath51  tev , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and the presence of 3 lepton and 2 quark messenger states .",
    "the latter is a somewhat odd choice , but is not restricted in any way . for these choices , @xmath54  gev .",
    "only the @xmath55 cross sections are of decent size : that for @xmath56 is about 1  fb and that for @xmath57 is about 3.6  fb , both obtained by requiring the forward - tagged jet as previously discussed",
    ". this would produce @xmath58 events at slhc , including detector efficiencies but no kinematic cuts , which should be highly efficient given that the @xmath14 quarks would come from the decays of very heavy states .",
    "another interesting susy scenario is that of anomaly - mediation ( amsb ) , which typically possesses the characteristic of very small mass splitting between the lsp and nlsp , which are usually the lightest neutralino and chargino , respectively .",
    "the nlsp can exhibit dramatic vertex displacements in the detector of many centimeters before decaying .",
    "because of this , sm backgrounds would be non - existent and the efficiency for capturing amsb events would be extremely high , close to @xmath48 , as in some gmsb scenarios .",
    "charginos would decay to @xmath59 and @xmath20 each about 1/7 of the time , giving an overall clean , charge - identifiable state about @xmath60 of the time in stop - sbottom events .",
    "we do not explore amsb parameter space widely , but find in general that it is difficult to obtain light - enough squark masses for lhc stop - sbottom production to be large enough to be useful , while at the same time avoiding the lep constraints on the chargino mass .",
    "our conclusions from this initial study relevant for lhc / slhc are threefold .",
    "first , it does appear that there is a path to separately measuring weak production of mixed - flavor third - generation squark pairs in many susy scenarios at the lhc / slhc . if further , more detailed studies bear this out , it represents a significant increase in the physics capability of lhc .",
    "second , the interpretation of weak cross section measurements would depend strongly on what additional information is extractable from other production processes .",
    "the signals proposed here could represent a way to help disentangle third - generation squark mixing , at worst , or a potential measurement of the weak vertex and the flavor matrix that diagonalizes squarks , relative to the ckm matrix of the standard model .",
    "this would depend mostly what variety of susy is realized in nature , if at all : the relative spectrum , the overall scale of susy masses , and other unforeseeables .",
    "while hints of generational squark mixing may show up in qcd production channels , measuring the weak production vertex would greatly aid in testing the flavor - diagonal hypothesis and measuring deviations from it .",
    "third , any scenario which has a long - lived nlsp is a boon for this measurement , as it would improve upon the detection efficiency of the signal by ( at a minimum ) a factor 4 - 5 .",
    "thus , any given model with squark and gluino masses that would appear to have a viable measurement of stop - sbottom production at slhc would probably become viable at lhc if it also had a long - lived nslp .    finally , we observe that our ability to pursue this interesting physics is limited only by cross section . because squarks are typically heavy , copious production at future colliders",
    "could potentially open a new window onto these deeper questions , if susy is found in nature .",
    "one path is a next - generation ( or beyond ) linear collider  @xcite , which could study the decays of squark pairs with great precision to help disentangle the mixing angles  @xcite .",
    "another possible path would be a higher - energy hadron collider such as the proposed vlhc  @xcite , which would have the ability to produce mixed - flavor squark pairs with cross sections typically two order of magnitude larger than at lhc .",
