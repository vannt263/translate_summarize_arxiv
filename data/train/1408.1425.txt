    "the overwhelming majority of the more than 100 gravitationally lensed quasars known so far consist of two quasar images or , due to the ellipticity of the gravitational potential in the lensing mass , four images .",

    "the non - simultaneously observed psf star in @xmath15 band was used to simulate the observed system 100 times , where each simulation differs in terms of the added noise , taken from a portion of the observed image that is devoid of sources .",

    "the errors resulting from these simulations are the standard deviations in the 100 values of each best - fitted parameter around the known true value .",

    "an implicit assumption in this method is that the observed psf star can be used as a representation of the actual psfs in the @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath13 bands , albeit solely for the purpose of estimating realistic error bars .",
    "this assumption is partly justified by the similarity of the analytical parameters describing the four psfs in table [ tab : analpsf ] , in particular _ fwhm1 _ , _ e1 _ , _",

    ", we have determined that the morphology of g1 and g2 is consistent with extended objects ( galaxies ) . however , due to the low s / n and close proximity to g2 , it can not be reliably distinguished whether gx is extended or point - like . in case it is fit by a sersic profile",
    ", it has a small effective radius and an unreliably determined sersic index . on the other hand ,",
    "gy consists of three features .",
    "while the central feature is extended , the morphology of the other two can not be constrained , and for the purpose of extracting the astrometry , they have been fitted as point sources .",
    "using the new high resolution observations , photometric redshifts were computed and a color - color plot was drawn for the objects seen in the field of view that is shown in figure [ fig:1405fov ] .",
    "the magnitudes of the isolated galaxies were measured with aperture photometry , and those of g1 , g2 and gx were obtained from profile fitting . as gy seems to consist of 3 objects , which all appear to be red in figure [ fig:1405closeup ] , and are difficult to model analytically due to the low s / n , aperture photometry was performed assuming they all have the same color . for this , all other objects were removed , using the best - fit model obtained with the hybrid psf , and the residuals were covered with nearby blank sky .",
    "three different blank sky covers were considered , in order to account for possible systematics .",
    "an aperture of 30 pixel radius was chosen for the aperture photometry , centered on gyb .",
    "the resulting error bars in all bands are smaller than 0.05 mag .    according to the color - color plot ( figure [ fig:1405color ] ) ,",
    "the galaxies seen in figure [ fig:1405fov ] show various colors , indicative of different redshifts rather than physical association into a group of galaxies .",
    "we estimated photometric redshifts from the @xmath21 bands using the template - fitting methods implemented in the publicly available software hyperz @xcite .",
    "as templates , we employed the observed mean spectral energy distributions of galaxies from @xcite .",
    "in particular , g3 , g4 and g6 have a redshift probability ( g3 is shown in figure [ fig:1405photoz ] ) consistent with @xmath22 , which is the estimated redshift of g3 in the sdss . on the other hand , g1 , g2 and g8 have similar colors and redshifts in agreement with @xmath23 , the spectroscopically estimated redshift of g1 .",
    "gx has different estimated colors in the extended / point - source cases , and assuming that it is a galaxy , it would be located at @xmath24 .",
    "more interestingly , gy appears to have a large redshift , consistent with that of the quasar .",
    "in this section , we test various mass models by exploring different scenarios given the complexity of this system",
    ". the most important constraint for strong lensing models is astrometrical .",
    "table [ tab:1405astrometry ] provides high - precision astrometry , as a result of the multi - band adaptive optics observations .",
    "we also used as constraint the flux ratio @xmath25 , which is very consistent between bands , and also with the optical flux ratio in @xcite .",
    "an uncertainty of 10% was set on the observed flux ratio constraint used for the gravitational lens models @xcite . even in the case of gx",
    "being the third quasar image , since its flux is likely to be affected by chromatic processes , we do not use it as a constraint in our model .",
    "the singular isothermal profile has extensively been shown to be a good approximation for the mass distribution in lensing galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references within ) .",
    "we therefore considered a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) , or the more general power law profile @xmath26 , as our mass models .",
    "we performed all gravitational lens modeling with _ glafic _ @xcite .      here , we discuss two mass models @xmath27 assuming that the system consists of only 2 lensed quasar images a and b , and @xmath28 assuming that the system consists of 3 lensed images , a , b , and gx . the latter case is suggested by the insecure morphology of gx ( section [ sect : psf ] ) , as well as the subsequent analysis based on its colors , which we will show in section [ sect:3imag ] .",
    "first , we considered the case when there are only two quasar images .",
    "g2 must be taken into account as a lens , due to its small distance to a and b , which is similar to the separation between them , and its similar luminosity to g1 .",
    "given the agreement between the photometric redshift of g1 and g2 ( figure [ fig:1405photoz ] ) , we assumed that they are both located at the lens redshift @xmath29 , and that the ratio of their velocity dispersions is constrained from their relative luminosities , through the faber - jackson relation @xcite .",
    "we used the 2sis+@xmath30 model , where the external shear @xmath30 was considered at the location of g1 .",
    "we ignored the gravitational lens effect of gx which , assuming it is a galaxy , appears to have different colors and therefore redshift compared to the main deflectors , and is located very close to g2 while being much fainter , making it a comparatively weaker lens .",
    "the parameters of this best - fit model , as well as those described below , are given in table 7 .",
    "next , the case when gx is an additional quasar image was considered . here",
    ", the observed position of image gx is an additional observational constraint .",
    "no flux ratio constraints were used , but the velocity dispersions of both g1 and g2 were fitted as free parameters . a perfect fit ( d.o.f .",
    "@xmath31 ) was obtained , with the velocity dispersion ratio g2/g1 @xmath32 , very close to the value obtained from the faber - jackson relation ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "this result shows that it is indeed possible for this two - galaxy system to produce three quasar images at the observed positions .    if an attempt is made to model the observed flux ratio @xmath25 as well , @xmath34/d.o.f .",
    "@xmath35 is obtained . while this is not a very good fit ,",
    "the model might be oversimplified . allowing for a third order perturbation @xcite a perfect fit",
    "is obtained ( model 4 in table 7 ) , where the orientation of the new component is fixed to correspond with that of the shear , in order to avoid a model with negative number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the use of a third order perturbation may be justified by the presence of the crowded environment in which the system is embedded ( figure [ fig:1405fov ] ) . as a last model ,",
    "a power law ( g1 ) + sis ( g2 ) + @xmath30 profile was also considered , with @xmath34/d.o.f.@xmath36 ( model 8 in table 7 ) .",
    "the reason why this is not a perfect fit is that the source is very close to the caustic , which is a curve in the source plane determined from the observed image , lens configuration and lens profile , whose crossing changes the observed image multiplicity ( figure [ fig:1405mass ] ) .",
    "this can be avoided ( i.e. the relative position of the source and caustic can be modified ) if ellipticity is also introduced , in the form of the singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) , at the expense of having negative degrees of freedom : a power law + @xmath30 ( g1 ) + sie ( g2 ) model produces @xmath34/d.o.f.@xmath37 ( model 9 in table 7 ) . for all mass models described here ,",
    "elliptical counterparts were also considered ( table 7 ) , where the orientation of the major axis was fixed to the value obtained from morphological fitting ( table [ tab:1405morphology ] ) , and the same was done for the ellipticity , unless this can not reproduce the number of observed images .",
    "this approach uses the known correlation between the orientations of mass and light profiles in elliptical lens galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as their mass and light ellipticity ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite , but see also @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",

    "[ fig:1405color],width=340 ]    .",
    "the vertical lines mark the spectroscopic redshift of the source quasar and of the main lensing galaxy g1 , respectively .",
    "the vertical axis represents the probability of exceeding the @xmath34 value obtained during the fit by chance , as a function of the number of degrees of freedom (= 2 ) .",
    "[ fig:1405photoz],width=317 ]      as we have shown above , gx is consistent with the position of a third lensed quasar image .",
    "morphological modeling in the @xmath15 and @xmath13 bands can not distinguish conclusively between a point source and an extended morphology .",
    "furthermore , g2 has an estimated einstein radius of @xmath38 ( table 7 ) , assuming it is located at the redshift of g1 , and the separation between g2 and g3 is only @xmath39 .",
    "since the colors of gx ( figure [ fig:1405photoz ] ) would put it at @xmath24 , in the background of g2 , it would be strongly lensed .",
    "in fact , four or five images of gx would be produced , some of them brighter and at a larger separation from g2 .",
    "such case is clearly inconsistent with the data .    in view of the above",
    ", we discuss the possibility of gx being a quasar image , based on its colors .",
    "although the colors are not consistent with those of images a and b , chromatic differences between quasar images are common in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such chromatic effects can be caused by dust extinction and microlensing in the lensing galaxy , as well as the intrinsic , time - delayed variability of the source quasar .",
    "it is clear that , assuming gx has a point - like morphology , according to figure [ fig:1405color ] , it must be reddened in comparison to a and b. here we test whether this can be explained by dust extinction .",
    "we assume that neither image a nor b is affected by extinction , since their colors are very similar .",
    "the color difference between a and gx ( hereafter renamed image c , when referring to its flux / colors ) , assumed to be due to extinction , can be used to estimate the extinction , using the equation    @xmath40 here , the left hand side is the observed magnitude difference of the two images , and @xmath41 refers each of the three observed bands , @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath42 denotes the model - predicted image flux , and @xmath43 is the extinction in the lensing galaxy rest frame , therefore @xmath44 .    to estimate @xmath45",
    ", we use the lensing models from section [ section : lens3 ] , which predict @xmath46 ( ignoring those with large mass ellipticity ) .",
    "the equation can therefore be solved for @xmath47 , obtaining a value of @xmath48 ( @xmath14 ) , @xmath49 ( @xmath15 ) and @xmath50 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "using an extinction curve from @xcite , and an @xmath51 extinction parameter with the galactic value of @xmath52 ( in agreement with the value found from the sample of lasdttir ) , a visual extinction @xmath53 ( @xmath14 ) , @xmath54 ( @xmath15 ) and @xmath55 ( @xmath13 ) is obtained , which translates to @xmath56/@xmath57 . although rare , such large visual extinction and color excess have been observed in lensing galaxies before ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we therefore conclude that color change due to extinction is plausible .",
    "a problem with this interpretation however is why image b , located similarly close to the larger g1 , also a similar elliptical galaxy , is not similarly affected by extinction .",
    "an alternative explanation is provided by microlensing due to stars in g2 , which can also cause large color differences ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the small separation between g2 and gx ( @xmath58 effective radius ) makes both extinction and microlensing plausible .",
    "if gx is the third quasar image , it has a negative parity , and is therefore more sensitive to microlensing effects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "microlensing is also expected to produce a flux change that is decreasing with wavelength , as observed . since",
    "neither a spectrum of gx ( which would also convincingly show whether it is the third quasar image ) , nor multi - epoch observations in the same band are available , the relative effects of extinction and microlensing can not be distinguished using the current data .",
    "on the other hand , intrinsic variability is not expected to play a significant part , since it generally produces much smaller color differences than observed here ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and in addition the similar time delays expected between images b and c ( table 7 ) would mean that differences should also be seen between a and b.",
    "lastly , we also investigated whether gx is a chance superposition of a nearby star . such a case",
    "is however excluded due to the observed colors , which are inconsistent with any stars observed in the infrared @xcite .      from figure [ fig:1405mass ] , it is immediately apparent that the source is located very close to a caustic ( red curve ) . as the source crosses inside the caustic ,",
    "two additional images are created .",
    "these images will be located close to , and on each side of the critical line ( blue curve ) .",
    "therefore , it is perhaps not coincidental that the observed elongated galaxy gy is located close to the position where the two additional images are predicted to be . since morphologically gyb is not consistent with a point source , but only gya and gyc ( although this is not certain , due to the low s / n ) , the case when gya and gyc are two additional quasar images was considered .",
    "however , this possibility is ruled out because the position of these two objects can not be reproduced , and in addition they are predicted to be brighter than image a. more specifically , two cases were considered , with or without accounting for gyc as an additional sis perturber ( 3sis+@xmath30 and 2sis+@xmath30 , respectively ) , and only the positions of the 5 images were fitted .",
    "this resulted in @xmath591400 for 3 and 4 d.o.f .",
    ", respectively .    there is , however , another interpretation for gy .",
    "its photometric redshift suggests that it may be associated with the quasar . as an isolated galaxy at high redshift",
    ", it would be lensed by g1 and g2 into multiple images , a fact which is ruled out by the observed data .",
    "it could , however , be interpreted as the quasar host galaxy . in fact , as the source is very close to the caustic and the host galaxy is an extended object , a portion of the host galaxy can cross the caustic and be significantly magnified , whereas the point - like quasar does not .",
    "indeed , figure [ fig:1405mass ] shows that an extended circular source centered on the source quasar would be lensed into an elongated object whose position , elongation and orientation shows remarkable agreement with gy .    to test this interpretation",
    ", we modeled the source as a superposition of a point - like and an extended ( elliptical ) sersic profile , and fitted it to the observed data , using _ glafic_. we used the @xmath13 band , where gy is detected at larger s / n , and we modeled the psf with two concentric moffat profiles .",
    "the reason why the hybrid psf considered in section [ sect : psf ] is not used is that , through the way it was constructed , it already includes a contribution from the extended source , which can not be modeled in this case as a different component .",
    "we kept fixed the mass model parameters determined from fitting the astrometry and flux ratio constraints in section [ section : lens3 ] , and varied only the parameters of the psf and the extended source .",
    "figure [ fig:1405torus ] depicts the result , which shows that the overall flux of gy is indeed well reproduced by the models , in case of two as well as three observed quasar images .",
    "this profile modeling therefore can not solve the issue of the number of point - like images that are observed , given the current observational data .",
    "faint features are still visible at the peaks of gya , gyb and gyc , which are not accounted for with this parametric - based source modeling .",
    "we computed the total magnification of the extended source models as the flux ratio in the image plane and source plane , and found a model - dependent value of @xmath60 .",
    "we also computed the magnification of the modeled gy profile as the ratio of the flux in gy , where all other images were masked , and the region of the source which is mapped into gy ( located inside the intersection area of all the caustics shown in figure [ fig:1405mass ] ) .",
    "here we found a magnification factor of @xmath61 .",
    "the magnification of gy relative to the whole unlensed source is @xmath62 .",
    "[ tab : lensing ]    the analysis above shows that the data is fully consistent with gy being the quasar host galaxy , lensed into an elongated arc .",
    "a question that arises with this interpretation is why gy consists of three components .",
    "this might be due to luminous substructure in the host galaxy , irregular overall morphology , a merging system , or small perturbers in the lens plane , which might disturb the arc .",
    "in particular , since gya and gyb are on each side of the critical line , it is plausible that they are mirror - symmetric images of the same feature .",
    "this was successfully checked by using one of the mass models predicting three quasar images , and considering a second point - like source to be lensed into gya and gyb ( figure [ fig:5imag ] ) .",
    "the use of a second source sets tighter constraints on the mass model ( models 6 and 7 in table 7 ) .",
    "three additional images are predicted , and their non - detection can presumably be explained by their close proximity to the quasar images , and their expected small fluxes .",
    "the two sources are separated by @xmath63 in the source plane , or @xmath64 kpc .",
    "this is on the order of one effective radius for typical galaxies at the source redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we also tried to fit two sources to the mass models predicting two quasar images , but this produced poor fits , with large lens ellipticity for g1 and g2 , at vastly different orientations than the observed light profiles .    in conclusion , in view of the photometric redshifts , as well as the good overall fit with the flux distribution expected for an extended source crossing a caustic",
    ", the data implies that gy indeed represents part of the quasar host galaxy .",
    "we refrain however from making quantitative estimates of the physical properties of the host galaxy from the current data .",
    "this is because of the quasar image number ( and therefore the magnification factor ) being unconfirmed , the fragmentation of gy , not accurately reproduced by a single analytical source profile , and the fact that it is difficult to assess whether the analytical psf is reliably disentangled from , or biases the parameters of the extended source",

    "we have conducted high resolution , near - infrared , multi - band adaptive optics observations with the subaru telescope of the gravitationally lensed quasar sdss  j1405 + 0959 . despite the low strehl ratios , the observations were successful in uncovering unprecedented detail in this system , and in particular in discovering two new components named gx and gy .",
    "we used a new technique to derive the psf , and determine the morphology , astrometry and photometry of the individual components that constitute the observed system .",
    "we showed that gx is likely to be the third quasar image in this system , based on its colors as well as lens modeling .",
    "if confirmed , it will be the first small - separation three - image lensed quasar produced by a pair of lensing galaxies , and in addition will allow the study of the interstellar medium of g2 .",
    "the nature of gx may be tested via high spatial resolution spectroscopy , or alternatively via deep observations with the hubble space telescope ( @xmath65 ) , which produces a better characterized psf , and may distinguish between the point - source or extended morphology of gx .",
    "in addition , such observations would also better separate the extended quasar host emission from the point - like quasar source .",
    "we note that our technique to obtain the psf may be affected by faint host emission underneath the bright quasar image",
    ". this might be responsible for some of the discrepancies in the morphology of g1 and g2 in the three observed bands , since the host galaxy is more prominent at longer wavelengths .",
    "we also showed that gy consists of additional lensed images of an extended region of the quasar host galaxy , based on the observed colors and the match between the observed light distribution and that expected for an extended lensed source , given the best available lensing models .",
    "adaptive optics - assisted or @xmath65 spectroscopy to determine a redshift would unambiguously confirm the nature of gy , as well as allow us to study its physical properties , such as star formation .",
    "the added advantage here is that gy shows emission from the quasar host galaxy alone which is free of contamination from the bright quasar components .",

    "<S> we present the result of subaru telescope multi - band adaptive optics observations of the complex gravitationally lensed quasar sdss  j1405 + 0959 , which is produced by two lensing galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> these observations reveal dramatically enhanced morphological detail , leading to the discovery of an additional object 026 from the secondary lensing galaxy , as well as three collinear clumps located in between the two lensing galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the new object is likely to be the third quasar image , although the possibility that it is a galaxy can not be entirely excluded . </S>",
    "<S> if confirmed via future observations , it would be the first three image lensed quasar produced by two galaxy lenses . in either case </S>",
    "<S> , we show based on gravitational lensing models and photometric redshift that the collinear clumps represent merging images of a portion of the quasar host galaxy , with a magnification factor of @xmath0 , depending on the model .    </S>",
