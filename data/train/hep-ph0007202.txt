    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite is one of the most promising extensions of the standard model .",
    "it offers a natural solution of the hierarchy problem @xcite , amazing gauge coupling unification @xcite , and dark matter candidates @xcite .",
    "if nature chooses low energy supersymmetry ( susy ) , sparticles will be found _ for sure _ , as they will be copiously produced at future colliders such as the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern or tev scale @xmath8 linear colliders ( lc ) .",
    "the lhc would be a great discovery machine if susy breaking masses lie below a few tev @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , there are several on - going and future projects searching for lsp dark matter .",
    "one of them even claims a positive signal @xcite , although the current situation is rather contradictory @xcite . in any case",
    ", it seems very plausible that both susy collider signals and lsp dark matter in the universe will be found in future .",
    "recently interesting possibilities have been pointed out where non  thermal production of dark matter is significant @xcite .",
    "generally the known bound from the thermal lsp density may easily be evaded by assuming a low post  inflationary reheating temperature of the universe , without endangering the standard successes of big bang cosmology @xcite . if the reheating temperature is below the neutralino decoupling temperature , the relation between neutralino pair annihilation rates and the mass density of the universe disappears .",
    "the mass may then be determined by other parameters , such as the q ball formation rate and decay time @xcite , or the moduli masses and their decay rates to lsps @xcite .    while these non  thermal mechanisms open exciting new possibilities , direct experimental or observational tests of them might be difficult , since they all have to occur before big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "it is therefore interesting to determine    1 .   the actual lsp relic density , both `` locally '' ( in the solar system ) and averaged over the universe ; and 2 .   the predicted thermal lsp relic density ,    as precisely as possible .",
    "these quantities are closely related to the mass and interactions of the lsp . a positive difference between the actual and predicted lsp density would indicate the existence of non  thermal relics , whereas a negative difference would hint at large entropy production below the lsp freeze  out temperature ( e.g. due to a low reheating temperature ) .    the matter density in the universe divided by the critical density , @xmath9 , is claimed to be tightly constrained already ; @xmath10 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the thermal relic density of the universe @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) has been calculated through the mass and interaction of the lsp , which is likely to be the lightest neutralino @xmath13 . in the absence of direct production of sparticles we have to rely on experimental lower bounds on sparticle masses as well as naturalness arguments to conclude that the predicted @xmath11 lies somewhere between @xmath14 and @xmath15 ; clearly this is not a very useful prediction , although it is encouraging that this wide range at least includes the correct value .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to discuss how future lhc experiments can contribute to the determination of the mssm parameters that are needed to predict the thermal lsp relic density and the lsp ",
    "nucleon scattering cross section .",
    "our goal is thus somewhat different from that of ref.@xcite , where it was simply assumed that all relevant parameters had somehow been determined by various experiments , with given errors ; the main emphasis was on estimating the resulting uncertainties in the predictions of the thermal lsp relic density and the lsp ",
    "nucleon scattering cross section .",
    "in contrast , we discuss in some detail _ how _ these parameters can be determined , and with what errors .",

    "3 we relax the assumption of universal scalar masses for higgs bosons . it is then easy to find cases with comparable higgsino and gaugino masses , @xmath22 , while keeping all squared scalar masses positive at @xmath16 .",
    "the lsp then has a significant higgsino component , so that its density can not be predicted by only studying @xmath23 decays .",
    "the situation is further complicated if we also relax the assumption of universal gaugino masses , since the neutralino mass matrix then depends on three independent , unknown mass parameters .",
    "we point out that the cascade decay @xmath24 can then often be identified , providing clear evidence that @xmath22 . in sec .",

    "in the minimal supergravity model one assumes universal soft breaking parameters at the gut scale : a universal scalar mass @xmath27 , universal gaugino mass @xmath28 , universal trilinear coupling @xmath29 , and higgs mass parameter @xmath30 .",
    "the renormalization group evolution of soft breaking squared higgs masses then leads to consistent breaking of the electroweak symmetry , provided the higgsino mass parameter @xmath31 can be tuned independently . in this paper , we chose the weak scale input parameters @xmath32 gev , @xmath33 gev , and @xmath34 .",
    "we minimize the tree level potential at renormalization scale @xmath35 , which reproduces the correct value of @xmath31 obtained by minimizing the full 1loop effective potential .",

    "in such a case @xmath51 exchange effects and/or lsp annihilation into @xmath50 pairs are expected to be more important than in the strict msugra scenario studied in the previous section , and one needs more information to predict the thermal contribution to @xmath11 .",

    "discriminating experimentally between scenarios with @xmath215 , where these new signals are small , and @xmath211 , where they are expected to be significant , would be important to predict the mass density of the universe . in the next section",

    "isajet @xcite was used to generate this spectrum . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to extract squark branching ratios from the number of events with a lepton pair in the final state , one must know @xmath216 and @xmath217 .",
    "these branching ratios also depend on mssm parameters , as shown in table  7 . here",
    "we assume that the @xmath218 and @xmath219 soft breaking mass parameters are the same as for first and second generation sleptons .",

    "the least critical quantity in table  7 is the branching ratio for @xmath223 decays .",
    "it decreases slightly with decreasing @xmath31 , due to the shrinking wino component of @xmath46 .",

    "however , such scenarios are already tightly constrained by lep data , and would give rise to a variety of higgs signals at the lhc . ]",
    "unfortunately this is not true for the branching ratio for @xmath227 decays , which does depend strongly on the mass and mixing angle of @xmath228 .",
    "note that the prediction in table  7 for the input point ( 0.296 ) differs from the input value in table  2 ( 0.236 ) .",
    "this is because we ignored the reduction of soft breaking @xmath136 masses through rg effects when computing the entries of table  7 . in the given case",
    "these effects only reduce @xmath229 by @xmath230 gev .",
    "this is sufficient to increase the partial width for @xmath231 significantly ; note that @xmath232 decays are pure p  wave in the limit @xmath233 , and the available phase space for these decays is not large in our case . since for both fit solutions shown in table  4 @xmath125 is significantly larger than the input value , these solutions predict even lighter @xmath124 states and enhanced @xmath234 mixing .",
    "the use of these parameters would therefore underestimate the true branching ratio for @xmath235 decays significantly .    in order to extract",
    "the squark branching ratios of table  6 to better than a factor of 2 one will therefore need additional information on the @xmath218 sector .",

    "3 , it should be possible to determine the edge of the di@xmath237jet invariant mass distribution to @xmath143",
    ". this would be sufficient to detect large differences between @xmath218 and @xmath238 masses ; however , it would not suffice to distinguish between the three cases used in table  7 . to this end",
    "one would need to determine the ratio of branching ratios for @xmath239 and @xmath236 decays .",
    "the precision of this measurement might be limited by systematic effects , since the two signals have very different efficiencies .",
    "mass difference is quite small , one may have to allow one of the @xmath142jets to be quite soft .",
    "] however , given that this ratio of branching ratios differs by more than a factor of 4.5 between the three scenarios of table  7 we think it likely that its measurement will help to reduce the errors of the extracted squark branching ratios significantly . finally , once a linear collider of sufficient energy becomes available precision studies of @xmath228 production and decay will be possible @xcite .",
    "let us summarize this somewhat complicated discussion by turning the argument around .",
    "one should first extract information about the @xmath218 sector , e.g. by comparing signals from @xmath240 to those from @xmath239 .",
    "this will give information on the soft breaking masses in the @xmath218 sector as well as on the product @xmath241 .",
    "this information , together with the result of the kinematic fit described above , will allow one to predict the branching ratios of the decays listed in table  7 with reasonable precision .",
    "this in turn will allow to translate the measured strengths of the signals from decay chains d1 ) and d2 ) into squark branching ratios .",
    "finally , these branching ratios can be used to greatly reduce the error on @xmath31 .    another way to further constrain the relevant mssm parameters is to include @xmath129 decay edges from decays d3 ) and d4 ) in the fit .",
    "just measuring @xmath242 values of these decay modes with 1% errors allows to reduce @xmath243 to 214 gev .",
    "however , this would still not allow us to give an upper bound on @xmath244 . at the @xmath245 level , but @xmath246 remains allowed at @xmath247 .",
    "] moreover , this edge may not be visible for larger gluino and squark masses , where the production cross section is substantially smaller .    given that the very weak upper bound @xmath248 which we imposed in the fit summarized in table  4 is sufficient to predict @xmath249 , it seems certain that the strategy outlined above will again allow to predict the thermal relic density to better than 20% .",
    "the only loophole occurs if @xmath244 is very large . in this case",
    "the @xmath250 mass difference becomes so small that the @xmath150 from @xmath228 decays become effectively invisible at hadron colliders . at the same time @xmath251 co  annihilation reduces the predicted lsp relic density by up to a factor of ten @xcite",
    "one would then need to increase @xmath27 and/or @xmath28 in order to get a cosmologically interesting value of @xmath11 ; @xmath227 decays may not be open . in this case",
    "straightforward kinematic fitting as we described here will not be possible at the lhc , although one should still get a hint for the relative ordering of @xmath228 and @xmath60 masses by observing @xmath142jets in missing @xmath252jets events , which will yield the most robust susy signal in this case .",
    "in such a somewhat contrived scenario kinematical precision measurements would probably only be possible at a lepton collider .",
    "in this paper , we argued that lhc experiments can play a substantial role in predicting the contribution @xmath253 of thermal relic lsps to the mass density of the universe .",
    "previous simulations in the literature were mostly done using msugra assumptions , where usually @xmath254 .",
    "in such a case the measured @xmath47 cascade decay determines @xmath20 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "once we know that the lsp is mostly bino , these three masses are sufficient to determine @xmath253 within 20% .    on the other hand ,",
    "if nature does not respect universality of all scalar soft breaking masses , it is possible that @xmath22 . in such a case",
    ", one needs to know @xmath31 and @xmath28 in addition to @xmath19 and @xmath20 to determine @xmath253 , because @xmath255-channel exchange of @xmath51 and @xmath256 , or @xmath176 production might play important roles in @xmath13 pair annihilation in the early universe .",
    "we showed that , if @xmath22 , @xmath26 and @xmath129 will be produced copiously in @xmath199 decays .",
    "one can then determine all mssm parameters needed to predict @xmath253 through the study of these cascade decay channels , using fits of kinematic end points and edges of invariant mass distributions .",
    "the isolation of @xmath257 decays by observing the subsequent @xmath258 decay may be used to improve the reconstruction of the @xmath26 production and decay kinematics .",
    "moreover , the measurement of the relative number of events from different decay chains further constrains mssm parameters . in the end",
    "it should again be possible to predict the thermal lsp relic density with an error of 20% or better even in this more complicated scenario .",
    "in fact , this scenario is advantageous , since it allows us to determine both the gaugino and higgsino components of the lsp ; these are needed to predict the strength of the lsp couplings to higgs bosons , which in turn are required for predicting the lsp ",
    "nucleon scattering cross section . in msugra scenarios with @xmath259 one",
    "can probably only establish an upper bound on the higgsino component of the lsp , which only allows one to derive upper bounds on lsp ",
    "higgs couplings .    notice that we _ only _ used information that can be extracted from studies at the lhc to arrive at this rather optimistic conclusion . if any one of the relevant masses could be determined with better precision elsewhere , e.g. at a lepton collider , the allowed region would shrink significantly , since the fit of hypothetical lhc data resulted in an almost one  dimensional @xmath260 domain .",
    "in this paper we discussed the case where @xmath261 so that neutralino decay into sfermion is open .",
    "this is a good assumption if @xmath13 is gaugino like , as @xmath13 density overclose the universe if @xmath127 . for increased higgsino component of @xmath13 , such a requirement is no longer necessary .",
    "it is interesting to see if one can extract sparticle masses from decay distributions for such cases .    in this paper",
    ", we did not study the case where @xmath262 , where the higgsino  like states @xmath13 , @xmath47 and @xmath46 are nearly degenerate in mass .",
    "in such a case we should observe @xmath263 production from squark decays in addition to @xmath191 production , which is now mostly @xmath264 . if scalar masses are not too large so that decays of the heavier neutralinos and charginos into real sfermions are open , the analysis is similar to the one that has been given in sec .",
    "4 . if the sfermion decay mode is closed , the decay to a ( virtual ) higgs boson might play an important role , unlike the case where @xmath22 .",
    "while on  shell higgs bosons produced in susy cascade decays can be identified @xcite , the kinematical fitting would be more difficult since it would be entirely based on jets .",
    "note , however , that the thermal relic density of higgsino  like lsps is small unless @xmath265 gev , in which case it might be difficult to even discover supersymmetry at the lhc .",
    "we also did not discuss the case where @xmath266 suggested in models with anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "these models predict a rather heavy gluino .",
    "this results in a limited number of events even at the lhc , making precision studies rather difficult . in models with a not too heavy gluino while keeping @xmath267 , the relative number of events from @xmath268 and @xmath269 might be useful to show that @xmath270 , if both modes are open",
    ". this would be sufficient to show that the thermal lsp relic density is small , independent of the relative ordering of @xmath174 and @xmath31 , since both wino  like and higgsino  like lsps with mass in the ( few ) hundred gev range annihilate efficiently .",
    "we thus conclude that whenever lhc experiments find a large sample of susy events , it will be possible to either predict the thermal relic density of lsps with a fairly small error , or else one will be able to conclude that thermal relic lsps do not contribute significantly to the overall mass density of the universe . in the latter case",
