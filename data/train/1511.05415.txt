    "quantum mechanics provides various resources .",
    "one of them is quantum non - locality @xcite .",
    "given the ability to perform measurements on a bipartite quantum state , one can obtain correlations which do not have a classical explanation in that they can not be predetermined before the measurements . to ensure this",
    ", one can perform statistical tests for quantum non - locality @xcite , known as the bell inequalities , the famous chsh @xcite inequality being a prominent example .",
    "the applications of non - locality go beyond quantum theory @xcite , reaching as far as device - independent security against a so called non - signaling adversary - a person possibly empowered with more than quantum resources , but still obeying the no - faster - than - light communication principle @xcite .",
    "another application of quantum non - locality is to communication complexity @xcite , where the use of quantum non - local correlations lowers the communication cost of evaluating a function using distributed computers .",
    "bell non - locality is a special case of the general phenomenon called _",
    "this phenomenon which had been discovered first by kochen and specker @xcite stems from the fact that in quantum mechanics the results of the measurement of an observable may depend on the context ( i.e. , the particular set of commuting observables ) in which it is measured . in consequence even for a single quantum system , sometimes a measurement can be said to create the outcomes , instead of merely revealing preexisting ones .",
    "quite a long history of research on contextuality has led to various non - contextuality inequalities @xcite , bell inequalities being a special case .",
    "quantum contextuality has for long been studied as a fundamental quantum property , reaching recently a connection to a resource which is required for universal quantum computing @xcite and quantum cryptography @xcite .",
    "two - party bell inequalities have also been studied in theoretical computer science in terms of two - prover interactive - proof systems , commonly referred to as \" ` games \" @xcite between two players and a referee . in this formulation",
    "one can let the players pre - share quantum data ( an entangled quantum state ) and the use of outcomes of measurements on it can lead to a higher probability of winning the game than in the case of classical shared randomness .",
    "yet higher success probability may be obtained , when the players are provided with a general system ( device ) which is only required to satisfy the no - signaling principle . in this framework ,",
    "the main quantity of interest is the winning probability of the game or in general the amount of violation of a bell inequality . in the case of a single player ,",
    "the bell inequality becomes a non - contextuality inequality or simply a constraint satisfaction problem ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in general it is np - hard to find the classical value of a general constraint satisfaction problem with many variables per constraint @xcite , so one considers special classes of games .",
    "a celebrated class of games is the so - called _ unique games _ with two players .",
    "these are games where for each pair of questions by the referee @xmath0 and for any answer of one player @xmath1 there exists only one answer of the other player @xmath2 which leads to winning . in other words ,",
    "the winning constraints are permutations : one - to - one mappings of the answers of one player into acceptable answers of the other : @xmath3 .",
    "computing the exact classical value of a unique game is known to be np hard @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is conjectured , that it is even np hard to distinguish whether a unique game has classical probability of winning almost @xmath4 , or close to zero .",
    "this conjecture , known as the unique games conjecture , has vast consequences for many questions in computer science @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it is known that the quantum winning probability of the unique game can be approximated to within a constant factor in polynomial time @xcite , in particular for a unique game with quantum value @xmath5 , one can find in polynomial time ( in the number of inputs and outputs of the game ) an entangled strategy which achieves value at least @xmath6 for the game .",
    "a subclass of unique games are the so - called xor games for two players , where the players return binary answers and the winning constraint for the game only depends on the xor of the players answers .",
    "computing the classical value of even this simplest class of unique game turns out be np hard @xcite , however it is known from the results of @xcite that the exact quantum value of the two - party xor game can be computed in polynomial time .",
    "it is notable that the xor games are equivalent to correlation based bell inequalities for two outcomes and have also been extensively studied in the physics literature @xcite . as such , virtually all applications of quantum non - locality such as in device - independent cryptography @xcite or randomness generation @xcite use two - player xor games or their multi - party generalization in terms of ghz paradoxes @xcite .",
    "while xor games have found widespread use , recently there has been much interest in developing applications of higher - dimensional entanglement @xcite for which bell inequalities with more than two outcomes are naturally suited .",
    "therefore , both for fundamental reasons as well as for these applications , the study of bell and non - contextuality inequalities with more outcomes is crucial . in this paper",
    ", we study a natural generalization of xor games which we call generalized xor ( gxor ) games or xor - d games @xcite .",
    "such games in case of two ternary inputs per party appeared first in the context of experiments @xcite , the specific example of the generalized chsh game was studied in @xcite and a general bound on the quantum value of xor - d games was proposed in @xcite . in this paper , we introduce a graph - theoretic characterization of these games , and apply it to the problem of finding the maximal classical and quantum values of such games .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the section [ sec : xor - and - beyond ] introduces the graph - theoretic formulation of xor games and the expression of the game value using graph - theoretic invariants involving edge labeling .",
    "we then describe an axiomatic generalization of the xor games in terms of two properties and show that the previously defined class of linear games @xcite is the unique class which satisfies these properties .",
    "we subsequently establish the graph - theoretic characterization of the subset of xor - d games and illustrate this with the example of games with ternary outputs .",
    "we then describe one of our results in section [ sec : labeled - eq ] , where we use the graph - theoretic formalism established in previous sections to identify when two games can be considered equivalent , in particular we establish a relation to the graph - theoretic notion of signed graphs and switching equivalence .",
    "then in section [ sec : bin - xor ] we study the classical value of these generalized xor - d games in a graph - theoretical manner .",
    "our results in this section include a characterization of the complexity ( as maxsnp - hard ) of computing the classical value of the simplest class of xor games , namely single - party anti - correlation games . in the next section [ sec : lovas ] ,",
    "we study the quantum value of these games , in particular we establish that the well - known lovsz theta number of the orthogonality graph of a contextuality game only gives an upper bound to its quantum value , unlike in the previously considered scenario of non - contextuality inequalities involving rank - one projectors .",
    "xor - d games have the important property that their optimal quantum strategies involve locally random and correlated outcomes , thus permitting them to be ideal candidates for device - independent applications . in section [ sec : diapp ] , we prove that no non - trivial finite xor - d game for prime @xmath7 can be perfectly won with a quantum strategy , thus providing evidence that the frequently used chained bell inequalities might indeed be the best candidates for such applications .",
    "we also extend the result to multi - party `` partial '' xor games which involve only two - body correlation functions , showing that such bell inequalities can not achieve algebraic violation . the final section [ sec : comparing - cl - qn ] is devoted to a numerical analysis of the classical and quantum values ( using semi - definite programming ) of games with upto three ternary inputs per party .",
    "we end with conclusions and some open problems .",
    "the aim of this section is to introduce the generalized xor games in a graph theoretical manner . in order to do it ,",
    "let us first recall a formulation of binary outcome xor games in terms of graphs with two types of edges corresponding to correlated and anti - correlated answers in section [ subsec : xorgames ] .",
    "specifically , the constraints will be represented by two differently labeled edges on a graph with vertices representing the questions to the players so that the graph is a bipartite graph .",
    "we then define the main objects of study - the winning probabilities of a game given classical , quantum and super - quantum resources respectively . in section [ subsec :",
    "genxorgames ] , we define the generalized xor ( xor - d ) games and establish their graph - theoretic formulation",
    ". the constraints of the game are represented by colored edges ( with more than two colors ) , we illustrate this with the example of games with ternary answers .",
    "we then use the graph - theoretic formulation to also represent a single player contextuality game .",
    "this is simply a _ constraint satisfaction problem _ : the constraints of the game still being represented by colored edges , but with no bi - partition on the vertices .",
    "the xor game involves a referee and two players : alice and bob .",
    "the referee asks questions @xmath8 to alice and @xmath9 to bob according to an input probability distribution @xmath10 .",
    "each player has two possible answers @xmath11 respectively . whether the players win or lose",
    "depends solely on the xor of their outputs : @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes addition modulo @xmath14 . to give an example , in the famous chsh game",
    ", the players win if @xmath15 , i.e. , when the @xmath16 of their answers equals the @xmath17 of the questions , with @xmath18 being binary .",
    "xor games are equivalent to correlation bell inequalities with binary outcomes , since the correlation functions @xmath19 are simply given by @xmath20 .",
    "in the game , the players can have access to certain resources .",
    "three types of resources are usually considered .",
    "the first are classical corresponding to shared randomness between the players . the second are quantum , i.e. , access to a bipartite entangled quantum state , and the set of measurements that can be performed on it by each player . and finally one also considers super - quantum resources , which correspond to access to a general device with inputs and outputs with the only constraint being that the device does not allow for signaling between the players .",
    "all the three resources have a common mathematical formulation as a conditional probability distribution @xmath21 from a certain set : classical ( @xmath22 ) , quantum ( @xmath23 ) and super - quantum @xmath24 , and in general @xmath25 .",
    "the no - signaling condition is expressed mathematically as _",
    "a p(a , b|x , y ) & = & _ a p(a , b|x,y ) _ x , x,y , b + _ b p(a , b|x , y ) & = & _ b p(a , b|x , y ) _ y , y,x , a , [ eq : nscondition ] in other words , the conditional probability distribution of each player is independent of the other party s input .",
    "the main object of study in xor games is the winning probability of the players , which is written as : [ eq : xor - game ] _",
    "s(g ) = _ p s _ ( x , y)_a , b \\{0,1}v(a , b|x , y)p(a , b|x , y ) where @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the indicator function reporting if the answers are correct ( for xor games @xmath28 only depends on @xmath29 ) .",
    "for example , in the case of the chsh game @xmath30 if @xmath15 and is set to @xmath31 otherwise . the three quantities are accordingly called the classical , quantum and super - quantum value of the game .",
    "we are now ready to present the formulation of xor games in graph - theoretic terms .",
    "an xor game is represented by a graph @xmath32 with a specific edge - labeling that denotes the winning constraint of the game .",
    "the inputs , i.e. , the questions asked by the referee , are represented by the vertices of a graph @xmath32 .",
    "two inputs are adjacent in the graph ( i.e. , connected by an edge ) if and only if the corresponding measurements can be performed simultaneously .",
    "the winning constraint @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : xor - game ] ) is represented by two types of edges - a solid edge corresponding to @xmath33 ( perfect correlations between the players ) and a dashed edge corresponding to @xmath34 ( perfect anti - correlations between the players ) that connect the inputs @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "a bell inequality is thus represented by a bipartite graph ( with the bi - partition corresponding to the two players ) .",
    "every xor game is a _ unique _",
    "game i.e. for every pair of questions @xmath0 and an answer of one player @xmath1 there is a unique answer @xmath2 of the second player that leads to winning .",
    "for this reason , we can also depict the two kinds of correlations as permutations of the set of outcomes .",
    "correlations are denoted by the identity @xmath37 ( i.e. @xmath38 ) and anti - correlations by the transposition @xmath39 ( i.e. @xmath40 ) ( see fig [ fig:2permutacje ] ) .",
    "we can formally define this as a labeling @xmath41 of the edges of graph @xmath32 . for an xor game depicted by a graph @xmath32 with an edge - labeling @xmath42",

    "note that these games belong to the class of linear games studied in @xcite where the answers @xmath57 of the parties are required to obey @xmath58 for a given set of functions @xmath59 that characterize the game .",
    "let us now prove that ( up to local relabeling of answers ) for odd @xmath7 , up to local relabeling of answers the above set of permutations in eq .",
    "( [ eq : def - gxor2 ] ) is the only one which satisfies the two properties above , i.e. , that the two properties ( p1 ) and ( p2 ) completely characterize the xor - d game . for even @xmath7 ,",
    "this is no longer the case .",
    "note that the prime @xmath7 corresponds to the case where the operation a + b mod d in eq.([eq : def - gxor ] ) is the addition in a finite field @xmath60 , which is the interesting case of linear games studied for example in @xcite .    for odd @xmath7 , up to local relabeling of answers by the parties , the only games which satisfy the properties @xmath61 and @xmath62 are those given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : def - gxor ] )",
    ".    the permutations that obey @xmath61 clearly have cycles of length at most two , i.e. , they consist of fixed points and transpositions only .",
    "let us first note that a permutation consisting of an even number of fixed points can not be part of the set of permutations considered , because the permutations consists only of transpositions besides the fixed points . also , a permutation consisting of an odd ( greater than one ) number of fixed points can not be part of the set of permutations considered .",
    "this is because of the requirement that there be @xmath7 permutations in the set and each permutation consists of at least one fixed point due to the previous considerations , so that having a permutation with more than one fixed point in the set leads to a contradiction with @xmath62 .",
    "we therefore see that each permutation in the set of @xmath7 permutations contains exactly one ( distinct ) fixed point .",
    "now , the number of permutations @xmath63 of a set of @xmath7 objects ( with @xmath7 odd ) consisting of only transpositions and exactly one fixed point is given by @xmath64 now , the @xmath7 permutation set @xmath65 defined by eq.([eq : def - gxor2 ] ) clearly obeys @xmath61 and @xmath62 . also , any set of @xmath7 permutations obtained from @xmath65 by a local relabeling , i.e. , applying a permutation @xmath66 to each element @xmath1 and @xmath67 for all @xmath68 and @xmath69 also obeys @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the number of permutations obtained by this operation is @xmath70 but this involves over counting since many of the permutations thus obtained are equivalent .",
    "a precise counting argument shows that the exact number of permutations obtained is given by @xmath71 which after some algebra is seen to be exactly equivalent to @xmath63 in eq.([eq : trans - fix ] ) .",
    "the generalized xor - d game is represented by a graph @xmath32 in analogous fashion to the xor game .",
    "namely , the vertices of the graph represent the inputs in the game and an edge between two vertices denotes that the corresponding measurements can be performed simultaneously . in the graph - theoretic representation of xor - d games ,",
    "we will use the notion of  colors \" to denote the edge - labelings that represent the winning constraints ( permutations ) in the game .",
    "we now also see the effect of the properties ( p1 ) and ( p2 ) characterizing the xor - d game .",
    "while the graph - theoretic approach can also be applied to general unique games , most non - linear games have to be represented by a directed graph , as the permutations defining the winning constraints need not be their own inverse . in fig .",
    "[ fig:3colors ] , we show an example of a game for a ternary output game with three possible winning permutations : red corresponding to @xmath72 , blue corresponding to @xmath73 and green corresponding to @xmath74",

    ". the proof of the statement follows directly from the fact that every unbalanced cycle leads to a contradiction , and from the following characterization of balanced signed graphs in @xcite .    a signed graph is balanced if and only if its set of vertices can be partitioned into two disjoint subsets in such a way that each positive edge joins two vertices in the same subset while each negative edge joins two vertices from different subsets .",
    "we now consider a subclass of xor games in which the winning constraints only ask for anti - correlations between the outcomes .",
    "this type of game is represented by a graph in which all the edges are dashed ( i.e. labeled by the permutation @xmath167 ) .",
    "clearly , all bipartite graphs with such a labeling are satisfiable , i.e. , the corresponding bell inequalities have classical value one .",
    "thus , single color games are trivial in the bell scenario and only relevant in a scenario of contextual games .",
    "also , for general graphs if the edges are all solid ( labeled by the identity ) then clearly , the game is won by a classical strategy .",
    "we now characterize the classical value of contextuality games corresponding to single @xmath39 color non - bipartite graphs , as we shall see computing the classical value is hard even in this simplest possible scenario .    for a graph @xmath32 with dashed edges only , @xmath89 equals the minimal number of edges needed to be removed , so that the resulting graph is bipartite .",
    "clearly , a bipartite graph with only dashed edges is satisfiable : one can assign value @xmath31 to all vertices in one partition , and value @xmath4 to the vertices in the other partition . to see the converse , recall that a graph is bipartite if and only if it does not contain an odd cycle .",
    "now , if a graph @xmath168 obtained from @xmath32 by removal of edges is not bipartite , it must contain an odd cycle .",
    "an odd cycle of @xmath39 edges clearly contains a contradiction for every vertex assignment .",
    "thus , determining the classical value of a single color contextuality xor game is equivalent to finding the edge - bipartization number @xmath169 of the corresponding graph .",

    "note that for the corresponding single color subclass for xor - d games , the edge - bipartization number only gives an upper bound on @xmath172 ( a lower bound on the classical value ) .",
    "since all cycles of even length in such graphs have @xmath173 , removing all cycles of odd length will result in a graph without contradictions . however , this is not always an optimal solution .",
    "for example , considering @xmath174 ( the cycle graph of length @xmath175 ) labeled with any single permutation @xmath176 , we find that @xmath177 while clearly @xmath178 since a vertex assignment satisfying such a winning constraint can always be found ( by assigning the same value to all vertices according to @xmath139 ) .",
    "the classical value of the specific xor - d game called the chsh - d game has been studied in @xcite using techniques from algebraic geometry . in this section",
    "we study the classical value of generalized xor - d games using graph - theoretic methods . clearly , if the game graph is cycle - free ( forms a tree ) , then any set of winning constraints for this graph can be satisfied",
    ". hence it must be the presence of the cycles , which disallows satisfiability .",
    "just like an unbalanced cycle in an xor game graph leads to a contradiction , there are also `` bad '' cycles in xor - d game graphs .",
    "these are the cycles for which no consistent vertex - assignment exists that satisfies all the winning constraints in the cycle .",
    "there are `` good '' cycles in an xor - d game graph analogous to the balanced cycles in the binary xor case , for which any consistent vertex assignment satisfying the winning constraint is admissible .",
    "however , in the case of xor - d game graphs , we encounter new `` ugly '' cycles , for which only certain particular vertex assignments satisfy the cycle ( see fig [ fig : good - bad - ugly ] ) .",
    "it then becomes a non - trivial question to study how many edges one needs to remove in order to make a graph satisfiable , as for instance in the fig . [",
    "fig : przyklad ] removing a bridge ( a single edge connecting two components ) of the graph can lead to a better result than a brute - force removal of one edge per each `` ugly '' cycle .",
    "we say that a cycle @xmath22 in a graph @xmath32 with edge - labeling @xmath179 is _ bad _ if it has no vertex - assignment that satisfies the constraints and _ good _ if it has @xmath7 such assignments ( i.e. the largest possible number ) , otherwise the cycle is _",
    "ugly_. we denote by @xmath180 with the corresponding subscript ( g , b , u ) the number of good , bad and ugly cycles respectively .",
    "clearly , any bad cycle has to be removed to make the graph satisfiable , while also removing all the ugly cycles necessarily leaves a satisfiable graph .",
    "now , if there are no ugly cycles @xmath181 , then @xmath182 if however @xmath183 , we can leave at least one ugly cycle .",
    "this is because the single ugly subgraph has an assignment , which determines a consistent assignment for the whole graph .",
    "therefore , we have the following observation .    for any xor - d game graph @xmath32 with edge - labeling @xmath42 using @xmath7 colors , if @xmath184 then @xmath182 , and if @xmath185 we have _",

    "an important property of the xor - d game bell inequalities is that for these , an optimal quantum strategy can be found for which the outcomes of each party are uniformly distributed and correlated .",
    "this makes these games ideal candidates for device - independent applications . indeed xor games , in particular the braunstein - caves chained bell inequalities have found widespread use in such tasks .",
    "we showed that for both partial and total functions , no finite xor - d game ( for prime number of outcomes ) exhibits the property of pseudo - telepathy , i.e. , maximum algebraic violation of such bell inequalities can not be obtained in quantum theory .",
    "we also extended the result to multi - party `` partial '' xor games which involve only two - body correlation functions , showing that such bell inequalities can not achieve algebraic violation .",
    "an interesting question is to develop this framework to get more analytical bounds such as in @xcite",
    ". it would also be important to study more general unique games using a similar approach . given that finite xor - d games do not exhibit pseudo - telepathy , an important open question is whether the chained bell inequalities and their generalization to many outcomes are the class of xor - d games that exhibit the best asymptotic rate of convergence of the quantum value to unity .",
    "numerical studies for small size games indicates that apart from the chsh - d games considered earlier , the quantum value for ternary output games is achieved at the level @xmath403 of the sdp hierarchy from @xcite",
