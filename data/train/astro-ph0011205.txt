    "3 ( leong et al .  1971 ) is a persistent x - ray source in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "it has an orbital period of 1.70  d , and a mass function @xmath6 ( cowley et al .  1983 ) .",
    "the optical brightness of @xmath7 indicates that the system has a massive companion ( van paradijs et al .",
    "the companion is often classified as a b3v star ( cowley et al .",
    "1983 ) , although a b5iv spectral type has also been suggested ( soria et al .",
    "the non - detection of eclipses in the x - ray curve implies that the orbital inclination of the system is  @xmath8 ( cowley et al .  1983 ) .",
    "the inferred mass of the compact star is  @xmath9 ( paczynski 1983 ) , thus establishing that the system is a black - hole candidate ( bhc ) .",
    "most bhcs show soft and hard x - ray spectral states .",
    "their x - ray spectrum in the soft state generally consists of both a thermal and a power - law component .",
    "the thermal component can be fitted by a blackbody spectrum with a temperature @xmath10  kev , and it is interpreted as thermal emission from the inner accretion disk . the power - law component is believed to be comptonised emission from a disk corona ( sunyaev & titarchuk 1980 ) or from the high - speed infalling plasma near the black - hole event horizon ( titarchuk & zannias 1998 ) . the photon index @xmath11 of the power law is @xmath124 . in the hard state ,",
    "the thermal component is insignificant .",
    "the spectrum is dominated by a flat ( @xmath13 ) , extended power - law component .",
    "3 is found in the soft state most of the time .",
    "lmc x-1 , another high - mass bhc in the lmc , has been seen in the soft state only .",
    "in contrast , cyg x-1 , the high - mass bhc in our galaxy , tends to be in the hard state for the majority of the time .",
    "such preference for either the hard or the soft state is not evident in the low - mass transient bhcs ( e.g.  gro  j1655@xmath1440 ) .",
    "it is still unclear how mass transfer occurs in 3 : whether via roche - lobe overflow or capture of the stellar wind from the companion",
    ". given the fact that a b3v star is unable to drive a strong stellar wind or to fill its roche lobe if it is in a binary system with a 1.7-d orbital period , it is difficult to explain the observed x - ray luminosity of the system .    in this letter",
    ", we report on the observations of 3 between 2000 february and june .",
    "the system was in an unusual hard state in april , and our observations span the transition from the soft state to the hard state and then back to a softer state . making use of these new x - ray spectral data , we attempt to shed light on the question of mass transfer in the system ( see also soria et al .",

    "epic observation log [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     ( 6.6,5.8 ) ( 0,0 )    ( 6.6,5.8 ) ( 0,0 )    ( 6.6,5.8 ) ( 0,0 )      we consider the rgs data to search for possible emission lines , and to constrain the value of the column density .",
    "the rgs spectra are fitted with the same model used in the analysis of the pn data .",
    "as the rgs spectra cover only the 0.35@xmath142.5  kev energy range , the thermal and the power - law components can not be constrained simultaneously .",
    "we therefore fix @xmath11 to the values determined from the epic fits ( with a correction to the value of @xmath11 from rev0045 to take the pile - up into account ) .",
    "because of the low count rate , the data in the rev0066 observations are binned in groups of 100 channels each .",
    "the error - weighted means of the fit values of @xmath1 are 0.52 kev and 0.29 kev for observations before and after rev0066 respectively .",
    "we do not find strong evidence of emission lines .",
    "the column density @xmath15 was generally below @xmath16",
    "@xmath5 , except for rev0066 , where @xmath15 is not well constrained . after the line - of - sight column density to the lmc is subtracted , the value of the column density for the observations before rev0066 is @xmath17  @xmath5 , and the value after rev0066 is @xmath18  @xmath5 .",
    "( these values are smaller than those obtained from the fits to the epic data . )",
    "given that the error may be dominated by systematic effects , the error obtained in the fits may not truly represent the statistical weights of the fit parameters .",
    "apart from the conclusion that the spectra do not show strong column absorption , we are unable to determine whether the variations in @xmath15 are correlated with the x - ray luminosity .",
    "previous /pca observations ( wilms et al .",
    "2000 ) have shown that when the source was bright ( with /asm count rates @xmath19  ct  s@xmath20 ) , the disk blackbody component was prominent , and its fit temperature @xmath21  kev .",
    "there was also a power - law tail with @xmath22 in the spectra .",
    "the temperature @xmath1 appeared to decrease when the x - ray luminosity decreased , while the normalisation parameter @xmath23 remained approximately constant .",
    "when the /asm count rate dropped below @xmath24  ct  s@xmath20 , @xmath1 was reduced to @xmath25  kev .",
    "the transition was accompanied by the hardening of the power - law component .",
    "the photon index @xmath11 became @xmath26@xmath27 .",
    "when the /asm count rate decreased below the 0.3-ct  s@xmath20 level , the disk blackbody component was not detected , and the spectrum was a power law with @xmath28 .",
    "the soft - to - hard transition was also seen in our data .",
    "the spectra obtained in the rev0028rev0045 observations show a disk blackbody component with @xmath29@xmath30 , and a power - law component with @xmath31 .",
    "the /asm count rate was below @xmath32  ct  s@xmath20 during the observations .",
    "the spectral properties are similar to those observed previously when the system had similar /asm count rates .",
    "the spectrum obtained in the rev0066/101 observations is dominated by a power law with @xmath33 .",
    "the photon index is consistent with that observed in the previous hard states ( wilms et al .",
    "2000 ) , while a lower value of @xmath34 was obtained by boyd et al .",
    "( 2000 ) on 2000 may 7 .",
    "the @xmath35 of the fit which includes a thermal disk black - body component ( best fit @xmath36  kev ) is 58.486 for 52 degrees of freedom .",
    "if the thermal component is not included , then we obtain @xmath37 for 54 degrees of freedom .",
    "the thermal component is therefore insignificant .",
    "the system was at the transition from the hard state back to the soft state during the rev0092 observations ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "the power - law component had steepened , with @xmath38 ( for the pn data ) .",
    "the disk blackbody component reappeared , with a temperature @xmath39  kev , significantly lower than that before rev0066 .    in summary , between 2000",
    "february and june 3 underwent a transition from a soft to a hard state , and then in the process of returning to the soft state . during the soft - to - hard transition the fit temperature of the disk blackbody component decreased , and the power law component became harder .",
    "as the system started to return to the soft state , the disk blackbody component became more prominent .",
    "the power law appeared to be steeper than that obtained from the rxte / pca observations near the middle of the faint state , yet the disk blackbody temperature was still well below the values of the previous soft state .",
    "the rgs data constrain the value of @xmath15 within the system to be @xmath40  @xmath5 , in contrast to the larger intrinsic column density expected for a companion with a strong stellar wind .",
    "the non - detection of obvious emission lines in the rgs spectra also indicates the absence of wind matter ejected in previous epochs ( cf .",
    "the p cygni lines seen in cir x-1 , brandt & schulz 2000 ) .",
    "thus , the spectral data do not support the mass - transfer scenario for 3 in which the black hole accretes matter mainly from a strong stellar wind from a massive companion . the high luminosity observed in the x - ray bands",
    "therefore requires the companion to overflow its roche lobe .",
    "a similar conclusion is also obtained independently from an analysis of the optical / uv properties of the system ( soria et al .",
    "the om data obtained in the rev0066 suggest that the companion is a b5 subgiant instead of a b3 main - sequence star .",
    "roughly 3% of the x - rays would be intercepted by the companion , so that the rate at which energy is deposited into its atmosphere can be @xmath41  erg s@xmath20 in the soft state .",
    "this rate is larger than the intrinsic luminosity of the companion . if the companion in 3 is indeed a subgiant star its tenuous envelope is susceptible to irradiation heating .",
    "the soft - to - hard transitions seen in the observations in 1997/1998 and the observations in 2000 may be caused by variations in the rate of mass overflow from the roche lobe of the subgiant companion .",
    "wilms et al .",
    "( 2000 ) s interpretation of the decreases in the rxte / asm count rate as evidence for transitions from soft to hard state is consistent with our data .",
    "we further propose that the decrease in the x - ray luminosity is caused by the decrease in the fraction of the roche lobe filled by the companion star .",
    "when the companion is detached from its critical roche surface , mass transfer will be dominated by a focused wind .",
    "it is worth noting that the three known high - mass bhcs are all persistent x - ray sources which show preferential x - ray spectral states .",
    "while cyg x-1 tends to be in the hard state , lmc x-1 and 3 are more often found in the soft state .",
    "recent studies ( e.g.  igumenshchev , illarionov & abramowicz 1999 ; beloborodov & illarionov 2000 ) have shown that accretion of matter with low angular momentum will give rise to hard x - rays instead of soft x - rays .",
    "the relative angular momentum of the accreting matter is smaller for wind accretion than for roche - lobe overflow .",
    "cyg x-1 has a 33-@xmath42 o - type companion ( giles & bolton 1986 ) , which has a strong stellar wind .",
    "the companion stars in lmc x-1 and 3 are less massive ( @xmath43  m@xmath44 ) b stars , whose stellar wind is much weaker .",
    "therefore , we suggest a unified scenario which relates the mode of mass transfer ( wind or roche - lobe overflow ) to the spectral state preferentially observed in these three high - mass bhc binaries ( hard or soft respectively ) .",
    "the subgiant companion of 3 may occasionally underfill its roche lobe because of feedback irradiative processes or instabilities in its envelope .",
    "this leads to the residual accretion of the ( focused ) wind matter which has relatively low angular momentum .",
    "the bhc 3 was observed in 2000 february  june , with the epic and rgs , throughout a soft - hard transition .",
    "the system was apparently in the process of returning to the soft state in 2000 june .",
    "the hard - state spectra are dominated by a power - law component with a photon index @xmath45 .",
    "the soft - state spectra consist of a thermal component with an inner - disk temperature @xmath1 of @xmath46  kev and a power - law tail with @xmath31@xmath47 .",
    "the line - of - sight absorption deduced from the epic and rgs data is @xmath48  @xmath5 .",
    "our observations therefore do not support the wind accretion model for this system in the soft state .",
    "the transition from the soft to the hard state appears to be a smooth process associated with the changes in the mass - transfer rate .",
