    "what is the best strategy to find a missing object ?",
    "anyone who has ever lost his keys has already been facing this problem .",
    "this every day life situation is a prototypical example of search problem , which under its simplest form involves a searcher  either a person , an animal , or any kind of organism or particle  in general able to move across the search domain , and one or several targets .",
    "even if very schematic , the search problem as stated turns out to be a quite universal question , which pops up at different scales and in various fields , and has generated an increasing number of works in recent years , notably in the physics community .",
    "theoretical studies of search strategies can be traced back to world war ii , during which the us navy tried to most efficiently hunt for submarines and developed rationalized search procedures @xcite .",
    "similar search algorithms have then been developed and utilized in the context of castaway rescue operations @xcite , or even for the recovery of an atomic bomb lost in the mediterranean sea near palomares in 1966 .",
    "one can cite for instance the rescue of the scorpion , a nuclear submarine lost near the azores in 1968 @xcite . at the macroscopic scale , other important and widely studied examples of search processes concern animals searching for mate , food or shelter @xcite which will be discussed in more details in this review .",
    "one can even mention pre - historic migrations , which , apart from classical archaeological literature , have also been studied as a search problem , in which human groups search for new profitable territories @xcite . at the microscopic scale ,",
    "search processes naturally pop up in the context of chemical reactions , for which the encounter of reactive molecules  or in other words the fact that one searcher molecule finds a reactive target site  is a required first step .",
    "one should obviously mention the theory of diffusion - controlled reactions , initiated many years ago by the celebrated theory of @xcite and developed by innumerable researchers ( see for instance the review by @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , this field has regained interest in the context of biochemical reactions in cells , where the sometimes very small number of reactive molecules makes this first step of search for a reaction partner crucial for the kinetics .",
    "one can think for instance of reactions involved in genomic transcription , a representative example of which being the search for specific dna sequences by transcription factors @xcite .    in all these examples , the time needed to discover a target is a limiting quantity , and consequently minimizing this search time often appears as essential . in order to get an intuition of what could be an efficient search strategy on general grounds , let us go back to the everyday - life example mentioned above ( see figure [ key ] ) .",
    "we consider a searcher who lost a tiny object  let us say a key  in a large sandy beach , where the key is so small that it can not be detected if the searcher passes by too fast .",
    "in addition , we assume that the searcher has no prior information on the position of the key , except that the key is in a bounded domain ( the beach ) . what is then the best strategy for the searcher to find the key as fast as possible ?",
    "a first strategy consists in a slow and careful exploration ( to make sure that the key will be detected upon encounter ) of the sand all along the beach . in the case of a very large beach , the search time",
    "can then be very long .",
    "an alternative strategy one can think of consists in interrupting the slow and careful exploration of the sand by mere displacement phases , during which the searcher relocates on the beach very fast , but without even trying to detect the key ( typically the searcher `` runs '' ) .",
    "we will call hereafter intermittent search strategies such processes that combine two distinct phases : a phase of slow displacement which enables target detection , and a phase of faster motion during which the target can not be detected ( note that the word intermittent has also been used more recently by @xcite with another definition )",
    ".    the efficiency of such intermittent strategies results from a trade  off between speed and detection and can be qualitatively discussed . intuitively , the advantage of the fast relocation phases for the searcher is to reach unvisited regions .",
    "the drawback is however that during these phases time is consumed without any chance of detecting the target .",
    "the net efficiency of this strategy is therefore not trivial , and these last years , many works have focused on the following questions : ( i ) can phases of fast motion which disable detection make the global search more efficient ?",
    "( ii ) if so , is there an optimal way for the searcher to share the time between the two phases ? ( iii ) are these intermittent search patterns relevant to the description of real situations ?",
    "the goal of this article is to review these works while bringing explicit answers to these questions .",
    "more precisely , we will first show that intermittent transport patterns are actually widely _ observed _ at various scales . at the macroscopic scale , this is for example the case of foraging animals ( see section [ section_animaux ] ) ; at the microscopic scale , we will show that intermittent transport patterns are involved in reaction pathway of dna binding proteins as well as in intracellular transport ( see section [ section_adn ] ) .",
    "second , we will show on generic stochastic models that intermittent strategies are _ efficient _ strategies which enable to minimize the search time ( see sections [ section_animaux],[section_adn],[section_generic ] ) , and therefore suggest that this efficiency could justify their frequent observation in nature .",
    "last , beyond these modeling aspects , we will propose that intermittent strategies could be used also in a broader context to _ design and accelerate _",
    "search processes .",
    "the search problem can take multiple forms @xcite ; in this section we define more precisely the framework of this review  namely the random intermittent search strategies  and introduce the main hypothesis which will be made .",
    "although in essence in a search problem the target location is unknown and can not be found from a rapid inspection of the search domain , in practical cases there are often cues which restrict the territory to explore , or give indications on how to explore it .",
    "we can quote the very classical example of chemotaxis @xcite , which keeps arising interest in the biological and physical communities ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "bacteria like e.coli swim with a succession of `` runs '' ( approximately straight moves ) and `` tumbles '' ( random changes of direction ) .",
    "when they sense a gradient of chemical concentration , they swim up or down the gradient by adjusting their tumbling rate  : when the environment is becoming more favorable , they tumble less , whereas they tumble more when their environment is degrading . this behavior results in a bias towards the most favorable locations of high concentration of chemoattractant which can be as varied as salts , glucose , amino - acids , oxygen , etc",
    "... more recently it has been shown that a similar behavior can also be triggered by other kinds of external signals such as temperature gradients @xcite or light intensity @xcite .",
    "chemotactic search requires a well defined gradient of chemoattractant , and is therefore applicable only when the concentration of cues is sufficient . on the contrary , at low concentrations cues can be sparse , or even discrete signals which do not allow for a gradient based strategy .",
    "it is for example the case of animals sensing odors in air or water where the mixing in the potentially turbulent flow breaks up the chemical signal into random and disconnected patches of high concentration .",
    "@xcite proposed a search algorithm , which they called infotaxis , designed to work in this case of sparse and fluctuating cues .",
    "this algorithm , based on a maximization of the expected rate of information gain produces trajectories such as zigzagging and casting paths which are similar to those observed in the flight of moths @xcite .    in this review",
    "we focus on the extreme case where no cue is present that could lead the searcher to the target .",
    "this assumption applies to targets which can be detected only if the searcher is within a given detection radius @xmath0 which is much smaller than the typical extension of the search domain . in particular",
    "this assumption clearly covers the case of search problems at the scale of chemical reactions , and more generally the case of searchers whose motion is independent of any exterior cue that could be emitted by the target .",
    "whatever the scale , the behavior of a searcher relies strongly on his ability , or incapability , to keep memories of his past explorations .",
    "depending on the searcher and on the space to explore , such kind of spatial memory can play a more or less important role @xcite .",
    "in an extreme case the searcher , for instance human or animal , can have a mental map of the exploration space and can thus perform a systematic search .",
    "figure 2 presents several systematic patterns : lawn - mower , expanding square , spiral ( for more patterns , see for example @xcite ) .",
    "these type of search have been extensively studied , in particular for designing efficient search operated by humans ( dobbie , 1968 ; stone , 1989 ) .        in the opposite case where the searcher has low  or no  spatial memory abilities",
    "the search trajectories can be qualified as random , and the theory of stochastic processes provides powerful tools for their quantitative analysis ( for a short reminder on random walks , see appendix [ resume_random_walks ] ) .",
    "this is obviously the case for `` molecular '' searchers at the microscopic scale which are subject to thermal brownian motion , but also at larger scales of animals with low cognition skills .",
    "this review is mainly focused on random search problems , and effects of spatial memory will be briefly discussed in the last section .    note that we will keep using the word `` strategy '' for animals with low cognitive abilities and even for molecules , although such searchers are not able to design strategies themselves since of course their dynamics are simply governed by the laws of physics . in the context of proteins searching for targets on dna , we mean that the search time depends on parameters such as the ionic strength or the protein / dna affinity which , if varied , can lead to a minimization of the search time . in the case where the search kinetics is a limiting constraint , such good or even optimal values of these parameters",
    "might have been selected in the course of evolution .",
    "we call strategy this very fact that physical parameters can be tuned ( implicitly by evolution ) to optimize a biological function",
    ". note however that the real optimization problem depends on many parameters and constraints .",
    "the models studied in this review are restricted to kinetic constraints , which can be dominant both at the microscopic and macroscopic scale , as discussed in sections ii and iii .",
    "this key assumption will be used throughout this review .      to summarize , in this review",
    "we shall focus on intermittent search strategies for targets which emit no cue .",
    "the searchers will be assumed to have no ( or low ) memory skills , resulting in their trajectories being intermittent random walks .",
    "depending on the example to be treated , different quantities can be used to assess the efficiency of search strategies , such as the energy necessary for reaching the first prey , the number of preys collected in a given time , or the time for encountering the first prey . in this review",
    "we will discuss the efficiency of search strategies uniquely from a kinetic point of view .",
    "we shall mainly consider the mean first passage time to a target as a quantitative measure of the search efficiency , and study the minimization of this quantity .",
    "note that the full distribution of the first - passage time is a priori needed to quantify the search kinetics on all time scales .",
    "however , in most of the situations that we will consider in this review , in can be checked numerically that the distributions of the search time can be well approximated by an exponential , which means that the kinetics is fully characterized by the mean first - passage time .",
    "[ section_animaux ]    searching for a randomly located object is one of the most frequent tasks of living organisms , be it for obtaining food , a sexual partner or a shelter @xcite . in these examples ,",
    "the search time is generally a limiting factor which has to be optimized for the survival of the species .",
    "the question of determining the efficiency of a search behavior is thus a crucial problem of behavioral ecology , which has inspired numerous experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite works . in this context",
    ", lvy walk strategies have been proved to play a crucial role in such optimization problems . in this section ,",
    "we first remind why these lvy walks are advantageous with respect to simple random walks when searching randomly , as first put forward by @xcite .",
    "we also remind the pioneering model of viswanathan et al . , which has played a major role in the development of ideas on random search strategies . on the other hand ,",
    "we show how intermittent strategies are naturally involved as soon as hidden targets are considered and define a basic model relying on intermittent strategies , introduced to account for the search behavior of `` saltatory '' animals .",
    "this one - dimensional model is then extended to a bi - dimensional model , which is shown to be a minimal model optimizing the search time .",
    "last , we discuss the relationships between these two main classes of search strategies  lvy and intermittent  and come back on the famous `` albatross story '' .        the ballistic phases interspersed with turns of animals trajectories have often been interpreted as lvy walks @xcite . actually , @xcite were the first to report that , due to their weak oversampling properties ( see figure  [ illustration_levy ] ) , lvy walks could be an efficient way to explore space and could be used to model in particular trajectories of foraging animals . as a matter of fact",
    ", the mean number of distinct sites visited in @xmath1 steps  which is a measure of the territory explored  is known to behave for a standard random walk like @xmath1 in dimension @xmath2 , and like @xmath3 if @xmath4 .",
    "this is less efficient in low dimension than for a lvy walk , of jump probability in dimension @xmath5 of the form @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 is the index of the walk ) , for which the mean number of distinct sites visited in @xmath1 steps behaves like @xmath1 , as soon as @xmath8 . from the point of view of the extension of the territory explored after a given number of steps ,",
    "the advantage of lvy walk patterns over standard random walks is thus clear , and this effect turns out to be as much marked as the number of searchers involved in the process is high @xcite .    [ illustration_levy ]     ( green , not present on the zoom ) , @xmath9 ( red ) , @xmath10 ( blue ) .",
    "the total path length is the same for the 3 examples.,height=10 ]      these observations led @xcite to propose the following lvy search model , in the presence of fixed targets randomly and sparsely distributed  : they consider a searcher performing ballistic step at constant speed , and detecting targets closer than @xmath11 .",
    "a target is found when the searcher encounters it for the first time .",
    "the step lengths are drawn from a lvy distribution @xmath12 , with @xmath13 . for @xmath14 ,",
    "the probability distribution is not defined . for @xmath15 ,",
    "the distribution has no mean and no variance . for @xmath16 ,",
    "the distribution has a mean but no variance . for @xmath17 ,",
    "the distribution has both a mean and a variance , thus it obeys the central limit theorem  : after enough steps , the probability distribution of the difference between the starting point and the last position is a gaussian , as if it were diffusion , with the mean square distance scaling linearly with time .",
    "@xcite are interested in the mean number of targets detected after a large observation time @xmath18 .",
    "more precisely , they ask the following question : is it possible to optimize this number with respect to the exponent @xmath19 characterizing the motion of the searcher ? to answer , they actually consider two different types of targets , which lead to two very different optimal strategies .",
    "* in the first case of what they call `` revisitable targets '' - meaning that , as soon as detected , a target reappears _ at the same location _ - they rely on a mean - field approximation of the problem and find that the encounter rate is optimized for a lvy exponent @xmath20 . * in the second case of `` non revisitable targets '' ( or destructive search ) where each target can be found only once , or in the case of a single available target , the optimal strategy proposed in @xcite is not anymore of lvy type , but reduces to a simple linear ballistic motion .",
    "several extensions of this pioneering model have been proposed .",
    "@xcite studied the case of non - revisitable moving targets .",
    "they showed that a lvy strategy with @xmath21 is often better than a `` brownian '' one ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "however , @xcite extended the study to ballistic motion , that outperformed these lvy strategies .",
    "an intermediate situation between revisitable and non revisitable targets has been studied by @xcite . in these works ,",
    "the immobile target is destroyed upon encounter , but regenerates after a time @xmath22 at the same place ( for example a plant bearing new fruits after previous fruits have been eaten ) .",
    "two regimes are found .",
    "when @xmath22 is large ( @xmath23 , a critical time evaluated in @xcite ) , the simple ballistic motion remains the best strategy .",
    "when @xmath24 , the best @xmath19 is between @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "however , one could argue that in this regime the simple strategy where the searcher does not move and waits for the renewal of the target outperforms searching for an hypothetical other target .    in @xcite ,",
    "the targets are in patches ( such as fish schools ) or lvy distributed . even if the targets are destroyed upon encounter , finding a target means that the presence of other targets in the vicinity is likely , which is close to the case of revisitable targets .",
    "hence , like for revisitable targets , the optimum is achieved for a lvy distribution , with @xmath27 .    in @xcite ,",
    "the optimum for destructive targets is @xmath28 except in two cases ( where @xmath29 ) . on the one hand",
    "the optimum is not ballistic when the searcher can fail in capturing a detected target . on the other hand , for targets destroyed upon encounter , and for the very specific one - dimensional case ,",
    "as the measure of efficiency is the number of targets captured during a long time , the searcher is after some time in a situation with a target close on one side , but the next target on the other side very far away  : a pure ballistic motion is not favored because it can take the wrong direction .    finally , in the case of revisitable targets and the related cases ( regenerating targets , patches , failed capture ) , the lvy strategy @xmath9 emerges as a compromise between trajectories returning to one and the same ever target zone , and straight ballistic motion which is indeed the best way to explore space .",
    "note however that , as stated above , in this case the strategy which consists simply in waiting for target renewal performs even better . in the case of non revisitable targets",
    " the generic situation considered hereafter  the best strategy for the searcher is a mere ballistic motion without reorientations .    in all",
    "these lvy walks models , the searcher is assumed to be able to detect targets all along its trajectory .",
    "qualitatively , it corresponds to the case of targets `` not too difficult '' to detect .",
    "however , as it was the case with the example of the lost small key given in introduction , it is evident that in some situations the velocity degrades the perception .",
    "what happens if the targets are really `` hidden '' , that is to say more precisely , if searching and moving are incompatible ?",
    "in recent years , many works have been devoted to answering this question .",
    "most of them rely on the following simple two - state model , historically introduced to account for the search behavior of the `` saltatory animals '' .",
    "anyone who has ever lost his keys knows that instinctively we often adopt an intermittent behavior combining local scanning phases and relocating phases . indeed ,",
    "numerous studies of foraging behavior of a broad range of animal species show that such an intermittent behavior is commonly observed and that the durations of search and displacement phases vary widely @xcite .",
    "the spectrum , which goes from cruise strategy ( for large fishes that swim continuously such as tuna ) , to ambush or sit - and - wait search , where the forager remains stationary for long periods ( such as rattlesnake ) , has remained uninterpreted for a long time . as explained in the introduction , the interest of this type of intermittent strategies , often referred to as `` saltatory''@xcite in the context of foraging animals ,",
    "can be understood intuitively when the targets are `` difficult '' to detect and sparsely distributed , as it is the case for many foragers ( such as ground foraging birds , lizards , planktivorous fish ... ) : since a fast movement is known to significantly degrade perception abilities @xcite , the forager must search slowly . then",
    ", it has to relocate as fast as possible in order to explore a previously unscanned space , and search slowly again .    even though numerous models based on optimization of the net energy gain @xcite predict an optimal strategy for foragers , the large number of unknown parameters used to model the complexity of the energetic constraint , renders a quantitative comparison with experimental data difficult . in the model presented in this section , the search time",
    "is assumed to be the relevant quantity optimized by the forager in order to obtain a sufficient daily amount of food and to precede other competing foragers .",
    "the energy cost is treated only as an external constraint that sets the maximal speed of the animal .",
    "as explained in the next sections , this purely kinetic model of target search captures the essential features of saltatory search behavior observed for foragers in experiments @xcite , when the predator has no information about the prey location .",
    "[ chien ]    the central point of this schematic model @xcite is that it relies on the explicit description of searching trajectories as intermittent . in the following it",
    "is assumed that the searcher displays alternatively two distinct attitudes ( see figure [ chien ] )  :    * a scanning phase , named phase 1 , during which the sensory organs of the searcher explore its immediate vicinity .",
    "this phase is modeled as a `` slow '' diffusive movement ( a continuous random walk with diffusion coefficient @xmath30 ) .",
    "the target is found when this movement reaches the target location for the first time . as focusing and processing the information received by sensory organs require a minimum time",
    ", the scan phase can not be too short , which implies a minimal mean time spent in this phase @xmath31 .",
    "* a motion phase , named phase 2 , during which the searcher moves `` fast '' and is unable to detect targets .",
    "these relocating moves are characterized by a ballistic motion ( at constant velocity @xmath32 ) . in the case of animals , there is usually correlations in the angles between two successive ballistic phases @xcite .",
    "we limit ourselves here to the case of high correlations , which allow us to consider an effective 1-dimensional problem for both phases , with phase 2 always in the same direction .",
    "next , it is assumed that the searcher randomly switches from phase 1 ( respectively , 2 ) to phase 2 ( respectively , 1 ) with a fixed rate per unit time @xmath33 ( respectively , @xmath34 ) , that is with no temporal memory .",
    "it leads to exponentially distributed phase durations , in agreement with numerous experimental studies @xcite , the mean duration of phase @xmath35 being @xmath36 .",
    "last , the preys are assumed to be immobile ( see section [ pascal ] for a discussion of moving vs immobile targets ) .",
    "we now evaluate the average time needed to find a target .",
    "the chosen geometry is a single target in @xmath37 on a segment of size @xmath38 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this geometry is equivalent to the case of regularly spaced targets or to the case of one target centered in a finite domain with reflective boundaries .",
    "@xmath38 is thus the typical distance between targets , or the size of the search domain .",
    "the instantaneous state of the searcher can be described by its position @xmath39 on the segment and by an index @xmath35 which specifies its motion : @xmath25 corresponds to the slow detection phase , and @xmath26 to the ballistic non - reactive phase .",
    "the survival probability @xmath40 that , when the searcher starts at time @xmath41 from @xmath39 and in state @xmath35 , the target has not yet been found at time @xmath18 , is known to satisfy the backward chapman - kolmogorov differential equations @xcite  : @xmath42 @xmath43 knowing that @xmath44 , the mean first passage time at the target , starting from @xmath39 in phase @xmath35 , is given by @xmath45 it is easily found from eqs.([1dcorrel1 ] ) , ( [ 1dcorrel2 ] ) to satisfy @xmath46 @xmath47 these differential equations have to be completed by boundary conditions . as we have periodic boundary conditions and as the target at @xmath37",
    "can be found only in state 1 , we get @xmath48 , @xmath49 .      the average search time @xmath50 is defined as the average of @xmath51 over the initial position @xmath39 of the searcher , which is uniformly distributed over the segment @xmath52 $ ] , as the searcher initially does not know the target s location .",
    "it is found to be given by @xcite  : @xmath53 with  : @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 in the limit of @xmath57 , this expression simplifies  : @xmath58 note that thanks to intermittence , @xmath59 , whereas for diffusion alone the mean detection time is @xmath60 ) .",
    "intermittence is thus favorable ( meaning that the gain , defined as @xmath61 is grater than 1 ) , at least for @xmath38 large enough .",
    "intermittence is favorable and the strategy can even be optimized .",
    "the mean search time is minimized for @xmath62 , and @xmath63 satisfying the relation  : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is an extra characteristic time , depending on the searcher s characteristics .",
    "this minimum takes a simple form in two different regimes .    *",
    "if @xmath66 , the minimum of the search time is for @xmath67 , and  : @xmath68 in this regime , denoted by s for `` searching '' , one has @xmath69  : the searcher spends more time scanning than moving . *",
    "if @xmath70 , the minimum of the search time is for @xmath67 , and  : @xmath71 in this regime , denoted by `` m '' for moving , one has @xmath72 , which means that the searcher spends more time moving than scanning .",
    "these results have been compared to experimental data from @xcite and @xcite , who provide the average duration of detection and ballistic phases , characterizing the saltatory behavior of 18 different species , as various as planktivorous fish , ground foraging birds , or lizards .",
    "the optimal strategy obtained above is shown to account reasonably well for these data ( see fig .",
    "[ compareanimaux ] and @xcite for further details ) .",
    "[ compareanimaux ]    these results show that the saltatory patterns observed are a way to optimize the search , and that it is probably a reason why this type of patterns is observed so often , as it could have been favored by natural selection .",
    "the model of intermittent search presented previously was one - dimensional , with ballistic phases infinitely correlated , in the sense that the direction taken is always the same .",
    "here we present a model of intermittent search strategies in dimension two @xcite which encompasses a much broader field of applications , in particular for animal or human searchers .",
    "it is shown that bidimensional intermittent search strategies _ do optimize _ the search time for non revisitable targets , i.e. targets that are destroyed upon discovery ( see section [ optimizing ] ) . the optimal way to share the time between the phases of non reactive displacement and of reactive search",
    "is explicitly determined .",
    "technically , this approach relies on an approximate analytical solution based on a decoupling hypothesis , which proves to reproduce quantitatively numerical simulations over a wide range of parameters .",
    "static mode .",
    "the slow reactive phase is static and detection takes place with finite rate @xmath73 .",
    "diffusive mode .",
    "the slow reactive phase is diffusive and detection is infinitely efficient .",
    "following the previous model , we consider a two state searcher ( see figure  [ figmodel ] ) of position @xmath74 that performs slow reactive phases ( denoted 1 ) , randomly interrupted by fast relocating ballistic flights of constant velocity @xmath32 and random direction ( phases 2 ) . we assume the duration of each phase @xmath35 to be exponentially distributed with mean @xmath75 . as fast motion",
    "usually strongly degrades perception abilities , we consider again that the searcher is able to find a target only during reactive phases 1 .",
    "the detection phase involves complex biological processes that we do not aim at modeling accurately here .",
    "however , we put forward here two modes of detection .",
    "the first one , referred to in the following as the `` diffusive mode '' , corresponds to a diffusive modeling ( with diffusion coefficient @xmath30 ) of the search phase like in the previous model , in agreement with observations for vision @xcite , tactile sense or olfaction @xcite .",
    "the detection is assumed to be infinitely efficient in this mode  : a target is found as soon as the searcher - target distance is smaller than the reaction radius @xmath0 . on the contrary , in the second mode ,",
    "denoted as the `` static mode '' , the reaction takes place with a finite rate @xmath73 , but the searcher is immobile during search phases . note that this description is commonly adopted in reaction - diffusion systems @xcite or operational research @xcite .",
    "a more realistic description is obtained by combining both modes and considering a diffusive searcher with diffusion coefficient @xmath30 and finite reaction rate @xmath73 . in order to reduce the number of parameters and to extract the main features of each mode , we study them separately by taking successively the limits @xmath76 and @xmath77 of this general case . more precisely , in these",
    "two limiting cases , we address the following questions  : what is the mean time it takes the searcher to find a target ? can this search time be minimized ? and if so for which values of the average durations @xmath75 of each phase ?",
    "we now present the basic equations combining the two search modes introduced above in the case of a point - like target centered in a spherical domain of radius @xmath78 with reflexive boundary .",
    "note that this geometry mimics both relevant situations of a single target and of infinitely many regularly spaced non revisitable targets . as in the previous model , the mean first passage time to a target satisfies backward equations @xcite ( see section [ section_methods ] ) for derivation ) , which write here : @xmath79 @xmath80 where @xmath81 stands for the mean first - passage time starting from state 1 at position @xmath82 , and @xmath83 for the mean first passage time starting from state 2 at position @xmath82 with velocity @xmath84 , of direction characterized by the angle @xmath85 . here",
    "@xmath86 if @xmath87 and @xmath88 if @xmath89 .",
    "in the present form , these integro - differential equations do not seem to allow for an exact resolution with standard methods .",
    "we thus resort to an approximate decoupling scheme , which relies on the following idea .",
    "if the searcher initially starts in phase 2 , and if the target is close , its initial direction matters .",
    "but as soon as the initial position is far from the target , there are numerous reorientations before finding the target , implying that the initial direction does not matter .",
    "consequently , if @xmath90 and once the mean search time has been averaged over the starting position , the effect of the initial direction can be neglected .",
    "it allows us to make an approximation and solve the system ( for more technical details , see appendix and @xcite ) .      for the diffusive mode of detection ( @xmath76 ) , an analytical approximation for the search time",
    "can be obtained ( see appendix [ section_generic_2dvd ] ) . in the case of low target density ( @xmath91 ) , which is the most relevant for hidden target search problems , three regimes arise . in the first regime @xmath92 , the relocating phases are not efficient and intermittence is useless . in the second regime @xmath93 ,",
    "it can be shown ( see section [ section_generic_2dvd ] ) that the intermittence can significantly speed up the search ( typically by a factor 2 ) , but that it does not change the order of magnitude of the search time . on the contrary , in the last regime @xmath94 , the optimal strategy , obtained for @xmath95 leads to a search time arbitrarily smaller than the non intermittent search time when @xmath96 .",
    "note that this optimal strategy corresponds to a scaling law @xmath97 which does not depend on @xmath32 .",
    "we now turn to the static mode ( @xmath98 ) ( see appendix [ section_generic_2dvk ] ) . in this case",
    ", intermittence is trivially necessary to find the target , and the optimization of the search time leads for @xmath99 to  : @xmath100 @xmath101 which corresponds to the scaling law @xmath102 , which still does not depend on @xmath32 .",
    "this bidimensional two - state model of search processes for non - revisitable targets closely relies on the experimentally observed intermittent strategies adopted by foraging animals . using a decoupling approximation numerically validated , it can be analytically solved , allowing us to draw several conclusions .",
    "( i ) the mean search time @xmath103 presents a global minimum for finite values of the @xmath75 , which means that intermittent strategies constitute optimal strategies , as opposed to lvy walks which are optimal only for revisitable targets .",
    "( ii ) the optimal @xmath104 obtained for two modes of detection are different and depend explicitly on @xmath30 and @xmath73 , leading to different scaling laws which are susceptible to discriminate between the two search modes .",
    "( iii ) a very striking and non intuitive feature is that both modes of search studied lead to the _ same optimal value _ of @xmath105 . as this optimal time",
    "does not depend on the specific characteristics @xmath30 and @xmath73 of the search mode , it seems to constitute a general property of intermittent search strategies .",
    "the robustness of these conclusions will be discussed further in section [ section_generic ] in the framework of a more general model .      as seen before ,",
    "intermittent strategies are an alternative to lvy walks ( defined in section [ subsection_levy ] ) for interpreting trajectories of foraging animals . however , the lvy walks are often thought as optimal and widespread in nature .",
    "is it really true ?",
    "many foraging animals , including albatrosses , deers and bumblebees to name a few , have been thought for long to adopt lvy strategies described in the pioneering work of @xcite .",
    "these foraging behaviors were repeatedly accounted for by a simple model stating in the more general framework of search processes that lvy walks are optimal search strategies , as they constitute the best way to explore space .",
    "recently , @xcite reanalyzed these data , completed by newly gathered data on foraging albatrosses , and showed that in fact there was no experimental evidence for the lvy walk behavior .",
    "this study questions the interpretation of several experimental works , but also raises a new important and puzzling question  : why animals do not adopt the lvy walk strategy which has however been reported to be an optimal search strategy ?",
    "here we clarify this apparently paradoxical situation .      as the optimality of lvy strategies crucially requires conditions on the targets ( regenerating at the same place , patched or hard to capture ) and conditions on the searcher ( no switch when a target is found , which is a very simple form of memory ) , it can not be taken as a general rule even if realistic for certain species . on the contrary , we argue that the general question of determining the best strategy for finding a single hidden target belongs to the situation of destructive search , where in the framework of the model of @xcite , the most efficient way to find a randomly hidden target is simply a linear ballistic motion and _ not _ a lvy strategy ( see section [ subsection_levy ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "there is no paradox  : the reason why lvy walks are not observed in the work of @xcite is probably because they do not constitute robust optimal search strategies .    and what about other experimental observations ? among experimental studies analyzing organisms trajectories as a succession of segments interspersed with turns , an important proportion reports times between turns distributed exponentially ( a list of examples far from exhaustive  :",
    "_ c.elegans _ worm @xcite , fish @xcite , plankton in a part of the conditions studied by @xcite , amoebae @xcite , etc . ) .",
    "however , apart from the controversial albatrosses study @xcite , there is a boom in articles claiming that lvy behavior is observed for some animal species .",
    "a part of them can be dismissed as evidence of lvy behavior . on the one hand , as explained in details in @xcite , due to experimental limitations , most data cover only a very limited range , which makes difficult a reliable identification of power laws . on the other hand , patterns and processes",
    "should not confused , as underlined by @xcite . the same observed patterns ,",
    "can often be explained by different models .",
    "it is not because a trajectory is similar to lvy walk trajectories that the underlying process is necessarily a lvy walk .",
    "for example , a composite classical random walk can look very similar to a lvy walk for a time short enough ( see figure  [ levy_compositerw ] ) .",
    "nonetheless , not all studies should be discarded , since limited studies neither prove nor rule out lvy strategies .",
    "( see @xcite for a review ) . as underlined by @xcite",
    ", other selection pressures could be predominant .",
    "for example , when targets location is known , exploitation could be optimized instead of search , and lvy walks could emerge from interactions between the environment and the searcher @xcite .",
    "lvy walk with @xmath9        composite random walk  : alternation of about 10 short steps ( mean 1 , distributed exponentially ) , and one large step ( mean 10 , distributed exponentially ) .",
    "lvy walks are a fashionable model for interpreting trajectories of foraging animals .",
    "however , on the one hand , there is controversy about at least a part of the experimental data which were thought to support lvy walks . on the other hand , the conditions in which lvy walks are optimal are very restrictive .",
    "however , it does not rule out any contribution of lvy statistics in the context of search processes .",
    "for example , as discussed by @xcite and in section [ section_temporal_levy ] , lvy statistics can be advantageously used in the context of intermittent trajectories . additionally , we argue that some animals can not detect their target when they are moving ballistically , and in fact alternate these fast but blind phases with detection phases .",
    "mean search time with intermittence can be smaller than with detection phase alone , and it can be minimized tuning the mean durations of each phase .",
    "intermittent search strategies , because they rely on the experimental observation that speed degrades perception , and because they prove optimal an robust , are good candidates for interpreting animals trajectories .",
    "the previous section has shown that intermittent search strategies are observed at the macroscopic scale . they are also observed at the microscopic scale . in the following ,",
    "we will focus on two examples : the localization by a protein of a specific dna sequence , and the active transport of vesicles in cells .",
    "various functions of living cells - and therefore at larger scales of living organisms - are regulated by coordinated chemical reactions between specific molecules , which are often present only in a few copy number .",
    "the importance of the kinetics of such search processes between reaction partners can be illustrated by the bacterial restriction and modification system @xcite , which involves couples of methyltransferase and restriction enzymes that recognize the same sequence on dna ( for example _ _",
    "eco__rv recognizes the sequence @xmath106 @xcite ) .",
    "methyltransferase enzymes methylate this specific sequence on the bacterial dna in order to protect it from restriction enzymes , whose function is oppositely to cut the dna at this specific sequence .",
    "this function is first aimed at impairing any intruder viral dna which enters the cell and which is very likely to contain the target sequence . indeed , this sequence , typically 4 - 8 base pairs , is very short as compared to the viral genome , which , depending on the virus , can be made of @xmath107 base pairs ( typically @xmath108 for bacteriophages ) .",
    "the infected bacteria then faces a vital search problem : restriction enzymes must find their target sequence on the viral dna reliably to inactivate the virus before it exploits the bacteria machinery and kills it .",
    "more generally , it is well established that some sequence - specific proteins find their target site in a remarkable short time . for the lac repressor for example ,",
    "@xcite measured association rates orders of magnitude larger than those expected for reactions limited by the classical three - dimensional diffusion ( results confirmed by @xcite at different salt concentrations , ruling out electrostatic effects as the only explanation ) .",
    "@xcite argues that in fact only a few enzymes react significantly faster than the 3-dimensional diffusion limit .",
    "however , this author underlines that many enzymes react at rates close to the diffusion limit , and that this observation is still impressive . indeed ,",
    "classical experiments are performed with a considerable excess of dna , which is very likely to contain sequences similar to the target sequence and therefore act as traps slowing down the enzymes in their search . in a series of seminal articles , @xcite proposed that 3d diffusion ( or `` hopping''/``jumping '' ) was not the only motion available to the protein , even if no energy is consumed ( unlike some enzymes which consume energy to scan dna processively ) .",
    "they suggested that in some cases , proteins could bind non specifically to dna due to a weak electrostatic interaction and diffuse along the chain in a process named sliding ( see @xcite and @xcite for more details on the weak electrostatic interaction ) . it was then argued that the combination of sliding and 3d diffusion , _",
    "i.e. _ facilitated diffusion , can make the search for a sequence two orders of magnitude faster than 3d diffusion alone and henceforth sufficiently efficient ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "actually , this search mechanism can be classified as intermittent , in the general meaning defined in introduction .",
    "indeed , on the one hand , 3-dimensional diffusion off the dna is fast , but does not allow for target detection . on the other hand , sliding is a phase of motion along dna , which therefore enables target detection , but which is much slower due to a higher effective friction .",
    "the pioneering studies on facilitated diffusion @xcite are based on ensemble measurements , which were for a long time the only way to experimentally access to protein / dna interaction .",
    "recently developed techniques make possible the observation of this interaction at the level of a single molecule , with a resolution in space and time still improving ( for a recent review on the experimental results of such techniques , see @xcite ) .",
    "it is now confirmed directly that many proteins searching for a specific sequence on dna combine `` hopping / jumping '' and `` sliding '' ( see figure [ dna ] ) . sliding phases have been clearly identified ( both in vitro @xcite and in vivo @xcite ) , as well as hopping / jumping phases @xcite .    with these new single - molecule experiments , theoretical models have bloomed too .",
    "here , we first present a stochastic approach of a simplified version of the problem , which shows that it is the intermittent nature of the trajectories that makes possible such high reaction rates .",
    "this minimal model permits to calculate explicitly the mean search time for such intermittent reaction paths , and shows that reactivity can even be optimized by properly tuning simple dynamic parameters of intermittent trajectories .",
    "next , we discuss the different directions of extension of recent theoretical models . .",
    "we present here a simple model of intermittent reaction paths with minimal ingredients @xcite .",
    "we first define the model , then explain the main steps of the calculation , and eventually give the results .       _ definition of the model . _",
    "we consider a generic protein searching for its target site on a dna molecule ( see figure [ dnamodel ] ) .",
    "the pathway followed by the protein , considered as a point - like particle , is a succession of 1d diffusions along the dna strand ( sliding phases denoted phases 1 ) and 3d excursions in the surrounding solution ( denoted phases 2 , during which the target is not accessible ) . in this minimal model",
    "we assume that the target site is a perfect reactive point of the dna molecule , which means that reaction occurs as soon as the target is reached by the protein .",
    "note that in this case the protein can find the target site only by diffusing along dna , and therefore follows the scheme of intermittent search presented in introduction .",
    "the key quantity that we evaluate in this section is the search time , or reaction time , defined as the mean first - passage time @xcite of the protein at the target , here denoted by @xmath109 .",
    "this quantity gives directly access in a mean field approximation to the first order reaction constant @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "we now introduce further ingredients of the model .",
    "the time spent by the protein on dna during each sliding phase is assumed to follow an exponential law with dissociation frequency @xmath33 .",
    "this law relies on a markovian description of the chemical bond which is commonly used for bimolecular association .",
    "the probability density that the protein leaves the dna at a random time @xmath18 is then given by @xmath111 , and the mean duration of a sliding event reads @xmath112 .",
    "the one  dimensional motion on dna during sliding phases 1 is modeled by a continuous brownian motion with diffusion coefficient @xmath30 .",
    "we assume that the ends of the dna chain act on the protein as reflecting boundaries ( see for instance @xcite ) , but in practice this assumption is unimportant for long dna molecules .",
    "moreover , the case of circular dna , such as plasmids , is readily obtained by taking the particular case @xmath113 .",
    "we next assume that the 3d excursions of phase 2 are uncorrelated in space .",
    "this means that after dissociation from dna , the protein will rebind the dna at a random position independently of its starting position .",
    "this is justified when the dna is in a random coil conformation , as in this case even short 3d excursions can lead to a long effective translocation of the linear position of the protein on dna .",
    "we further assume that the probability density @xmath114 of the duration @xmath18 of such 3d excursions is exponentially distributed , and write @xmath115 .",
    "this assumption is justified , at least for the tail of the distribution , as soon as the 3d excursions of the protein are confined in a closed volume , for instance an experimental volume in vitro , or in vivo the cell or a cell compartment .",
    "the mean time @xmath116 spent in the surrounding solution in phase 2 can then be shown to be proportional to the confining volume @xcite .",
    "we next introduce @xmath117 , which is the conditional probability density that the protein , being on the dna at position @xmath39 and at time @xmath41 , will dissociate at time @xmath18 before any encounter with the target site .",
    "we rewrite this quantity as :    @xmath118    where @xmath119 is the conditional probability density that the protein , starting from the position @xmath39 , does not meet the target site during a single sliding event .",
    "the probability density @xmath120 of the first passage to the target site position at time @xmath18 without dissociation is then related to @xmath119 according to @xmath121 .",
    "last , we introduce @xmath122 , which is the conditional probability density that the protein , being on dna at position @xmath39 at time @xmath41 , will find the target site for the first time at time @xmath18 within a single sliding phase 1 , without leaving the dna :    @xmath123    given these quantities , we show below that the first - passage density of the protein to the target site , and consequently the reaction constant , can be calculated explicitly .       _ first - passage density . _    by calculating the first - passage density , we obtain the mean reaction time , as well as all associated moments .",
    "we assume that the protein starts at @xmath41 in state 1 ( bound to the dna ) at position @xmath39 .",
    "we consider a generic event whose number of 3d excursions is @xmath124 , and denote the duration of successive sliding phases @xmath125 , and the duration of successive 3d excursions @xmath126 .",
    "the probability density of such an event , for which the protein finds the target site for the first time at time @xmath127 is :    @xmath128    where @xmath129 and @xmath130 are averaged over the initial position of the protein : @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "we denote by @xmath38 the dna length on the `` left '' side of the target site and by @xmath133 the length on the `` right '' side of the target site .",
    "the average of a function @xmath134 over the initial position @xmath39 is given by @xmath135 .    to obtain the density of first passage to the target site , @xmath136",
    ", we sum over all possible numbers of excursions and we integrate over all intervals of time , ensuring that @xmath137 .",
    "the average over the initial position of the protein , @xmath138 , can be expressed as : @xmath139\\left[\\prod_{i=1}^{n-1}p_{1d}(t_i ) \\right ] \\bar{p}_{1d}(t_{n}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] taking the laplace transform of @xmath140 , @xmath141 , we obtain : @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the laplace transform of @xmath120 .",
    "this expression completely solves the problem _ for any 1d motion_. we will see next that the main quantities of physical interest can be extracted from this formula .       _",
    "optimal search strategy .",
    "_    the relevant quantity to describe the protein / dna association reaction is the mean time @xmath144 necessary for the protein to find the target site ( see above ) .",
    "this mean time is obtained from the derivative of the first passage density by the following relation :    @xmath145    which combined with equation ( [ densite ] ) gives :    @xmath146    this expression is general and holds for any @xmath147 motion in the slow phase 1 .",
    "now , we calculate this quantity in the case where the phase 1 is a free @xmath147 diffusion .",
    "the one  dimensional laplace transform of the first passage probability density is well known ( see @xcite ) , and leads to , after averaging over the starting position @xmath39 : @xmath148 where @xmath30 is the diffusion coefficient .",
    "this defines as a by product the association constant of the reaction as @xmath149 .",
    "two first comments are in order .",
    "( i ) first , as soon as the length of the dna strand is large enough ( more precisely as soon as @xmath150 or @xmath151 ) , @xmath144 grows linearly with the length of the dna .",
    "this mirrors the efficiency of intermittent reaction paths , as compared to the quadratic growth obtained in the case of pure sliding .",
    "in particular , the boundary effects are negligible for this quantity as soon as the overall length is large enough .",
    "( ii ) second , this expression is valid for a very large class of 3d motions .",
    "more precisely , it holds as soon as the mean first return time @xmath152 corresponding to the 3d motion is finite and independent of the departure and arrival points .",
    "we now come to an important question recently addressed in @xcite , which concerns the _ optimization _ of such intermittent reaction paths .",
    "we here assume that the mean search time is a limiting quantity which might have been minimized in the course of evolution . in this context , we consider @xmath153 , which characterizes the protein / dna affinity , as the adjustable parameter . indeed",
    ", this quantity depends strongly both on the structure of the protein and on physiological conditions such as the ionic strength , and therefore could widely vary from one protein to another . on the contrary",
    "@xmath154 depends mostly on the properties of the environment , such as the dna conformation , which is itself subject to very stringent constraints and therefore much less likely to be varied .",
    "another adjustable parameter is the 1d diffusion coefficient @xmath30 .",
    "optimizing the search time with respect to this parameter is trivial : it is found that @xmath30 should be as large as possible ( assuming that @xmath30 and @xmath33 are independent ) , but obviously one should keep in mind that @xmath30 is controlled by the hydrodynamic radius of the protein which can not be too small .",
    "for these reasons we focus here on @xmath33 .",
    "it can be seen qualitatively that @xmath144 is large for both @xmath33 very large ( in the limit @xmath33 infinite , the protein is never on the dna ) , and @xmath33 very small ( pure sliding limit which gives a quadratic growth with the dna length ) , and could therefore be minimized for and intermediate value of @xmath33 .",
    "the sign of the derivative of the mean search time at @xmath155 shows that it can indeed be minimized provided that @xmath156 this condition means that bulk excursions , to be favorable , should be shorter than a fraction of the typical time needed to scan the full dna molecule by 1d diffusion . in particular",
    ", it requires that the dna length is long enough .",
    "if this condition is fulfilled , the search time can indeed be minimized ( see figure [ kdna ] ) . a careful analysis of the implicit equation satisfied by @xmath33 at the optimum leads to the following expansion for large @xmath157    @xmath158    equations ( [ condex ] ) and ( [ lammin ] ) refine the result of @xcite , which predicts than the optimal strategy is realized when @xmath159 .",
    "this result actually holds in the large @xmath160 limit , or more precisely for @xmath161 . for intermediate values of @xmath160 boundary effects",
    "become important and the minimum can be significantly different .",
    "the @xmath144 value at the minimum is particularly interesting .",
    "we compare it to the case of pure sliding where @xmath162 : @xmath163 the efficiency of the 3d mediated strategy is therefore much more important when the dna chain is long . for example , using standard values for @xmath33 ( a few @xmath164 ) and @xmath30 ( typically @xmath165 ) and for a dna substrate of length @xmath166 bp , the mean reaction time is three orders of magnitude smaller than for a pure sliding strategy . beyond the importance of such results for understanding the kinetics of gene transcription , this first minimal model shows that intermittent reactive paths are indeed very efficient , and that they can even allow to optimize the reaction kinetics .",
    "the model introduced above provides a simple way to discuss the minimization of the search time .",
    "further approaches have been developed to model target search by proteins .",
    "we present below the main models used in the literature , and discuss their relevance to real target search problems by proteins in cellular conditions .",
    "[ [ main - approaches ] ] main approaches + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +       generally speaking , theoretical models of facilitated diffusion rely on the basic assumption that the protein alternates phases of 1d diffusion along the dna and phases of free diffusion when the protein is desorbed from the dna .",
    "the existence of such two distinct states , whose dynamics is usually characterized by association / dissociation rates , is supported by direct experimental observations as discussed above .",
    "additionally , molecular dynamics simulations taking into account the electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged dna and the locally positively charged protein ( see for example @xcite ) have shown that these two states naturally arise on the basis of the electrostatic interaction only , suggesting the robustness of the facilitated diffusion mechanism .",
    "such studies at the molecular scale could serve as a tool to calculate the association / dissociation rates used in the models of facilitated diffusion discussed in this section , which all take into account only effectively the molecular interactions .",
    "_ stochastic modeling _",
    "the minimal model presented in section [ section_dna_minimal_model ] relies on the statistical analysis of the trajectory of a single protein , and can henceforth be qualified as a stochastic model .",
    "similar stochastic methods have been used and complemented in @xcite , ... and have the advantage , when solvable , of giving access to the full distribution of the search time , yielding a refined information on the search kinetics .",
    "moreover they can be adapted in some cases to take into account anomalous transport both in the 1d and 3d phases as discussed below .",
    "_ kinetic approach _",
    "the main alternative to the stochastic approach is given by what can be called kinetic models , which assume a steady - state homogeneous concentration of proteins in contrast with the single protein description of stochastic models .",
    "such models therefore rely on a mean - field approximation which proves to be efficient to evaluate the mean search time thanks to scaling arguments .",
    "a first example is given by @xcite , where scaling arguments are used to roughly estimate the time for the protein to find the dna coil , and then the time to find the target inside the coil , which eventually yields an optimal sliding length . more generally , the key ingredient of kinetic models , developed mainly in @xcite , is that the system is assumed to be in a stationary state . under this hypothesis ,",
    "the flux of particles delivered by the 3d diffusion into the sphere of influence of the target , whose size is defined as the `` antenna length '' @xmath167 , must be equal to the flux of particles delivered by 1d diffusion into the target . such balance equation generically reads @xmath168 where the concentrations of free ( @xmath169 ) and adsorbed ( @xmath170 ) proteins are assumed to be at equilibrium , _ ie _ satisfying @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the equilibrium constant associated to the association / dissociation rates .",
    "importantly , the antenna length , defined as the typical scale below which the dominant transport is sliding instead of 3d diffusion , has size @xmath167 when measured in 3d space , but takes another value @xmath173 when measured along the dna . making assumptions on the dna conformation ( for instance random coil or fractal globule ) , different scaling laws between @xmath173 and @xmath167 can be proposed .",
    "equation ( [ grosberg ] ) then permits to determine @xmath167 and henceforth to give the scaling of the mean search time @xmath174 .",
    "the advantage of this method is that it permits , through the relation between @xmath173 and @xmath167 , to take into account various models of dna conformations , which is much harder to achieve in the stochastic approach .",
    "such models , whose results are compatible with the stochastic approach , provide in addition a useful picture of facilitated diffusion .",
    "indeed , in these models the effect of sliding can be seen as effectively making the target of the size of the antenna length , which is much larger than the real target size , and therefore speeding up the search .",
    "finally , these two approaches are quite complementary and both require as an input the modelling of 1d and 3d phases .",
    "the minimal model of section [ section_dna_minimal_model ] describes the 1d phase as regular diffusion , while 3d phases are assumed to result in completely random relocations over the dna . beyond this minimal model ,",
    "the specific description of these two phases has motivated numerous works and many refinements have been discussed in the literature .",
    "we review in the next sections the main models that have been proposed to provide a more realistic description of 1d and 3d phases .",

    "such crowding effects in one dimension are known to potentially lead to a subdiffusive behavior .",
    "additionally , even in the case of a single protein , it should be kept in mind that the dna sequence is not homogeneous , and the disorder in the sequence can also impact on sliding .",
    "the heterogeneity in the sequence is often modelled by a disordered energy landscape , whose distribution is gaussian @xcite .",

    "the diffusive behavior is recovered only at larger times , or equivalently for sliding lengths longer than a hundred of base pairs .",
    "anomalous diffusion in the sliding phase has been discussed at the theoretical level in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , which extend the minimal model of facilitated diffusion @xcite summarized in section [ section_dna_minimal_model ] . in particular , the laplace transformed search time distribution is obtained for several non brownian sliding motions such as ballistic , self - similar or halted motions ( in particular when halts durations are widely distributed , leading to a subdiffusive behavior ) , therefore covering standard models of anomalous diffusion .",
    "importantly , @xcite find that whatever the model of sliding , there are always regimes in which intermittence is favorable , similarly to the case of brownian sliding .",

    "this quantity depends both on the dynamics of the protein and on the conformation of the dna , and in practice can be determined explicitly only in the case of an ideal infinite cylindrical dna ( see below ) , which makes assumptions necessary in realistic situations .",
    "depending on the relocation length @xmath181 , 3d excursions have been given in the literature different names , mainly either `` hops '' ( referring to `` small '' @xmath181 ) and jumps ( referring to `` large '' @xmath181 ) .",
    "since the definition of jumps and hops may vary according to authors , the limit between both being somehow arbitrary , we give below the one that will be used in this review .",
    "[ model_adn_3d ]       _ jumps _",
    "we define as jumps the 3d excursions whose starting and ending points on the dna sequence are uncorrelated , _ ie _ such that the relocation probability @xmath179 is independent of @xmath39 .",
    "this definition of course depends on the dna conformation , and makes sense only for dense enough conformations such as a random coil ( for instance for free dna in solution ) or even denser packings that can be expected in vivo ( such as fractal globule structures @xcite ) . in such structures , sequences which are far apart along the dna chain",
    "can be actually very close in the 3d space .",
    "hence , 3d excursions whose relocation length is larger than the typical distance between dna segments are likely to end at any remote location on the dna sequence , and should therefore be considered as jumps according to our definition .",
    "the lower bound of the relocation length of jumps therefore strongly depends on the dna conformation and is in practice hard to evaluate . in the case of interest of a confined dna ( as in cellular conditions )",
    ", the typical distance between dna segments can be estimated by the dna density - density correlation length @xmath182 .",
    "this suggests an alternative and equivalent definition of jumps as 3d excursions whose relocation length is larger than @xmath182 . a widespread assumption used for example in the minimal model of section [ section_dna_minimal_model ] ( see also @xcite at scales larger then the antenna size or @xcite ) consists in taking all 3d excursions as jumps , _ ie _ as random uniform relocations over the dna .",
    "even if not exact , this assumption has been checked numerically on the example of a quenched self avoiding dna and as proved to be very satisfactory @xcite at high enough dna concentration .",
    "interestingly , this definition of jumps highlights the importance of the local dna concentration on the search efficiency , as observed in @xcite : the more densely packed the dna , the smaller the correlation length @xmath182 , and therefore the higher the probability of jumps enabling the protein to explore previously unscanned areas , and the less the time spent in 3d phases .",
    "the assumption that all excursions of relocation length larger than the typical distance between dna segments lead to a completely uniform relocation over the dna is however not exact . indeed ,",
    "large scale correlations in the 3d conformation of the dna chain may exist , as in the model case of a free random coil conformation .",
    "in particular in eukaryots , where dna is packed in the nucleus , recent studies such as @xcite support a hierarchized structure of dna which could induce long range correlations in the conformation and therefore a non uniform relocation probability . the impact of dna conformation on the relocation probability has been tested on the example of an annealed worm - like chain polymer by @xcite who found that at short times , 3-dimensional excursions of approximately the dna persistence length are actually less abundant than both shorter and a bit larger relocations : by definition , closer sequences along the dna are closer in 3d space , but sequences further than the persistence length can take advantage of loops and actually be even closer in 3d space .",
    "more generally , the loop statistics impacts on the relocation probability and can lead to a non uniform relocation probability @xmath179 .",
    "@xcite argue that since polymers form loops whose linear size @xmath39 is distributed according to @xmath183 ( for instance @xmath184 for gaussian chains , @xmath185 for self - avoiding walks ) , relocations distributed according to the same law are favored and should also be taken into account . in an annealed version of such a model , the authors show that depending on @xmath186 the optimal strategy can widely vary .",
    "it should be added that loops can enable another relocation mechanism for proteins with multiple binding sites called intersegmental transfer ( see @xcite and @xcite ) which can be shown for modelling purposes to be widely equivalent to 3d excursions .",
    "finally , the approximation of uniform random relocations proved to be useful and can be validated numerically for simple dna conformations    @xcite , but a better knowledge of the in vivo conformation of dna would be necessary to assess more precisely the relocation probability .",
    "_ hops _    echoing the definition of jumps ,",
    "we define hops as 3d excursions whose starting and ending points on the dna sequence are correlated , or equivalently as 3d excursions whose relocation length is smaller than the typical distance between dna segments , which is given by the correlation length @xmath182 for confined dna . due to their local character , hops are often effectively taken into account in the sliding mechanism ( see @xcite for example ) .",
    "if this assumption is in practice useful , it also raises additional questions .",
    "( i ) first , hops do not explore continuously the dna , and a protein performing hops have higher chances to miss the target ( note that hops permit as a counter part to bypass obstacles on the dna ) , and this non perfect reactivity has to be taken into account .",
    "( ii ) second , if hops are included in an effective sliding mechanism , then the effective diffusion coefficient as to be determined , as well as the effective transition rate from this effective sliding state to the jumping state .",
    "this last point amounts in practice in calculating the relocation probability @xmath179 of hops , which gives as a byproduct the probability that after desorption from dna , the protein performs a jump rather than a hop .",
    "this problem , which has been studied numerically in @xcite , can actually be studied analytically @xcite , since at the scale of hops , which are smaller than the dna persistence length @xmath187 , the dna can be simply modelled as a cylinder of effective radius @xmath188 ( see figure [ fig1 ] left ) . denoting @xmath30 the 3d diffusion coefficient of the protein ( assumed point - like ) .",
    "the density probability @xmath189 of being adsorbed on the dna at the longitudinal abscissa @xmath39 , starting from the point @xmath190 then satisfies ( for details on derivation of this equation and the following ones , see @xcite , and @xcite for similar analysis ) : @xmath191 assuming radiative boundary condition on the cylinder surface to account for the adsorption rate on dna , @xmath192 one can show that : @xmath193 where @xmath194 are bessel functions .",
    "this relocation distribution , in good agreement with experimental data from @xcite obtained on an extended dna , enables to address the questions of point ( ii ) above .",
    "first , eq.([pi ] ) gives the analytical distribution of hops , since for @xmath195 the dna can be well approximated by a cylinder . in turn , as shown in @xcite , this gives access to the effective diffusion coefficient of a combine motion of sliding and hops .",
    "second , according to our definition , all relocations with @xmath196 will be jumps .",
    "thus , the probability that a 3d relocation is a jump rather that a hop is given by the complementary cumulative distribution : @xmath197    going back to the search problem , in regimes where jumps are favorable , decreasing the correlation length speeds up the search process , as found by @xcite .       _ crowding effects _    in both prokaryots and prokaryots ,",
    "the cellular medium is very crowded , and 3d excursions of proteins are likely to be hindered .",
    "the normal or anomalous nature of transport in cellular medium is still debated .",
    "for instance , @xcite supports that 3d motion is mostly normal diffusion ; whereas @xcite suggest that there is more and more evidence for subdiffusion . experimentally , it is found that some tracers exhibit transient behavior ( subdiffusive at small timescales , diffusive at larger time scales ) : measures however depend on the size and nature of the tracer , on the time and length - scales covered and other experimental conditions , which may explain the lack of consensus on the problem .",
    "the influence of subdiffusion on target search will depend on the microscopic mechanism at play .",
    "there are three main mechanisms leading to subdiffusion , as underlined section [ resume_random_walks ] : random walk on a fractal medium , random walk with long waiting times ( ctrw ) , or random walk with long range correlations such as fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) . which of these possibilities best describes transport in crowded environments such as the cellular medium is however still unclear ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite or @xcite for various opinions on the subject ) .",
    "@xcite explore the effect of a crowded environment with subdiffusion @xmath198 ( @xmath199 ) caused by waiting times distributed as @xmath200 .",
    "they argue that because of these waiting times , the probability that the protein has not yet left the dna at time @xmath18 and the probability that an unbound protein has not yet bound to dna after a time @xmath18 both scale as @xmath201 .",
    "their results have two main practical implications .",
    "on the one hand , in an experiment , since proteins can remain stuck for very long times , ensemble averages do not lead to the same results as time averages as also highlighted by @xcite . on the other hand , since proteins would slide for a longer time and as it would take them a very long time to return to dna , the genes coding for transcription factors should be close to their target sequences , as also underlined by @xcite .",
    "the analytical determination of the relocation distribution above can be extended to a fractal medium @xcite . in this case , using the @xcite formalism , the large @xmath39 behavior of the relocation distribution is obtained as @xmath202 where @xmath203 is the dimension of the projection of the fractal on the axis parallel to the cylinder @xcite .",
    "hence , the relocation distribution always decays faster than in the case of normal diffusion ( @xmath204 ) . as a consequence , the proportion of jumps in the case of random conformation of dna in the fractal type crowding scales like @xmath205  : it is much smaller than for regular diffusion , which shows that fractal crowding favors hops and changes the overall intermittent search .",

    "however , the entire distribution of the search time can be needed to assess the search kinetics on all time scales .",
    "obviously in the case of simple exponential distributions of the search time , the mean is sufficient to describe the full dynamics .",
    "however , several models discussed below have shown that the search time distribution could not always be a single exponential .",
    "such departure from an exponential distribution can have important consequences , such as large fluctuations of the search time which could be an extra source of variability in gene expression .",
    "_ effect of trapping sequences _",
    "a first possible source of fluctuations in the search time could come from the existence of trapping sequences along the dna .",
    "since a target sequence is typically 10 base pairs long , very similar sequences are statistically unavoidable and can be expected to be local minima in the protein / dna interaction energy landscape . @xcite",
    "propose a model in which the protein can be stuck on such sequences which are similar to the target .",
    "the corresponding trapping times naturally introduce new time scales in the problem , which potentially could be very long . in the framework of this model",
    ", it is shown that the search time distribution is best described by _ two _ exponentials .",
    "in particular , the mean search time is controlled by long trapping events even when they are very unlikely , and can be orders of magnitude larger than the median search time which is controlled by the trajectories that do not fall into the traps .",
    "the main outcome of such model is that it reconciles the possibility of having long lived stable complexes ( _ ie _ deep traps ) , and very fast typical search times , which were casted so far as paradoxical requirements .",
    "_ effect of @xmath1 searchers _",
    "the influence of the number of searchers has been discussed by several authors @xcite .",
    "importantly , as stressed in @xcite , the mean time for @xmath1 independent searchers is simply given by the mean time divided by the number of searchers only if the search time distribution for a single searcher is a single exponential .",
    "in the case of non exponential distributions ( _ eg _ a sum of weighted exponentials ) it can be shown that the effect of the number of searchers can be much stronger since the weight of long time scales decreases exponentially with @xmath1 , selecting for @xmath1 large enough only the shorter time scale of the problem ( see @xcite ) . moreover ,",
    "if the concentration of searchers increases considerably , searchers can not be considered as independent anymore and will act as `` roadblocks '' along the dna .",
    "these roadblocks will decrease the effective sliding length , and may also hide the target , overall slowing down the search process .",
    "this results in a trade - off , as stressed in @xcite . on the one hand ,",
    "the more the proteins , the more the searchers for the target and the quicker the search . on the other hand , the more the proteins , the more the crowding , the less efficient the search of a single protein .",
    "these authors predict that the optimum is obtained for @xmath206 dna binding proteins for e.coli , which is close to the experimental value of 30  000 proteins .",
    "_ dependence on the starting point : colocalization _    another origin of fluctuations of the search time can be due to its dependence on the starting position of the protein .",
    "@xcite show that a target which is close to the starting point of the protein can be found within a single sliding phase , which yields a very short search time and a rather low variability .",
    "in contrast , if the target is far away from the starting point of the protein , it is found after numerous 3d excursions .",
    "the mean search time is then much longer , and the spread of the distribution of the search time is larger .",
    "@xcite then argue that for increasing the efficiency of the transcription factor , its coding sequence ( _ ie _ its starting position ) should be colocalized with its target sequence ( see also @xcite for a further optimization of this colocalization effect with respect to the diffusion coefficient of the protein ) .",
    "colocalization is indeed observed in real prokaryotes genomes .",
    "such mechanism can however be invoked only in prokaryotes , where there is no cell compartments separating protein production from dna .",
    "more generally , geometric effects on search kinetics have been discussed in @xcite , where it is shown that low dimensional effects , such as sliding or diffusion on fractals , can lead to non exponential distributions which depend strongly on the starting position of the searcher .",
    "such mechanism could be important for eukaryots .",
    "indeed , in eukaryotes , dna is packed inside the nucleus in what is called the chromatin , and some dna regions could be more or less accessible depending on the chromatin configuration . for example",
    "the dna close to the nucleus pores is much more accessible to incoming proteins than the dna buried deep inside the nucleus , leading potentially to very different search times .",
    "@xcite argues qualitatively that proteins binding to dna could take advantage of the heterogeneities of the chromatin , and , depending on the searched sequence , adopt different optimal strategies .",
    "the geometric effect can be particularly important in the case of genes which need to be activated simultaneously .",
    "indeed , their colocalization in the nucleus permits to share the transcription material , since the search time for a transcription factor going from one to the other will be much smaller than in the case of a random localization in the nucleus .",
    "the mechanism of facilitated diffusion of proteins on dna is intrinsically intermittent in the general meaning defined in this review  : it is a combination of one dimensional motion in close interaction with dna , called `` sliding '' , which enables target detection , and faster 3d excursions . from the theoretical point of view , this further example of intermittent process has been shown to significantly speed up the search . over the past few years , strong experimental evidences have been brought in , showing that this mechanism is indeed at play .",
    "interestingly , in this case in the `` fast '' phase the searcher is not able to detect the target not because of a lowering of its perception abilities , but simply because the motion takes place in a geometrical space which does not contain the target .",
    "most of microscopic realizations of intermittence fall in this case as we will see in next section on a further example .",
    "after this first microscopic example of intermittent search , we turn to another example  : active transport of vesicles reacting at specific locations in cells .",

    "as many molecules or larger cellular organelles like vesicles , lysosomes or mitochondria , hereafter referred to as tracer particles , can randomly bind and unbind to motors , the overall transport of a tracer in the cell can be described as alternating phases of standard diffusive transport ( sometimes subdiffusive ) , and phases of active directed transport powered by motor proteins @xcite ( see figure  [ comparaison_transport_vesicules ] ) . in particular , @xcite studied the rate of transitions between ballistic , diffusive and `` on the target '' states of vesicles , and found that the vesicles studied are much more likely to react in the free diffusive phase than when bound to motors .",
    "active transport in this case is therefore clearly a further example of intermittent behavior",

    "this transport is important for example for dynamically regulating the distribution of proteins such as membrane receptors .",

    "as shown in previous sections , intermittent search strategies are observed at the macroscopic scale ( foraging animals ) as well as at the microscopic scale ( localization of a dna sequence by a protein , vesicle transport in cells ) .",
    "the models we have used to interpret these findings , in particular in sections [ animaux_alternative ] and [ section_generic_vesicles ] , present similar general features .    in @xcite , a generic model of intermittent search based on these general features has been introduced , and studied systematically in 1 , 2 , and 3 dimensions , and for three different modelings of the detection phase .",
    "this rather technical section ( completed by appendix ) gathers the main tools usually involved in the calculation of first - passage properties of intermittent random - walks , and utilized throughout this review .",
    "finally , general conclusions on intermittent random walks can be drawn from this systematic study , and are summarized in table [ recapgeneral ] .",
    "the generic model presented in this section follows the original definition of intermittence given in introduction and relies on a succession of slow phases with detection , and ballistic phases without detection , without direction correlation between ballistic phases .",
    "this model is minimal in the sense that the searcher has low memory skills . indeed , without correlations between ballistic phases",
    ", there is no spatial memory .",
    "we also assume a markovian searcher , _",
    "i.e. _ with no temporal memory .",
    "as previously we address the following main questions : is it beneficial for the search to perform such fast but non reactive phases ? is it possible , by properly tuning the kinetic parameters of trajectories ( such as the durations of each of the two phases ) to minimize the search time ?",
    "we develop in what follows a systematic analytical study of intermittent random walks in one , two and three dimensions and fully characterize the optimal regimes .",
    "overall , this systematic approach allows us to identify robust features of intermittent search strategies .",
    "in particular , the slow phase that enables detection is often hard to characterize experimentally .",
    "here we propose and study three distinct modelings for this phase , which allows us to assess to which extent our results are robust and model independent .",
    "our analysis covers in details intermittent search problems in one , two and three dimensions and is aimed at giving a quantitative basis  as complete as possible  to model real search problems involving intermittent searchers .",
    "we first define the model and introduce the methods .",
    "then we summarize the results for the search problem in dimension one , two and three , for different types of motion in the slow phase .",
    "eventually we synthesize the results in the table [ recapgeneral ] where all cases , their differences and similarities are gathered .",
    "this table finally leads us to draw general conclusions .",
    "we consider an intermittent searcher that switches between two phases",
    ". the switching rate @xmath33 ( resp .",
    "@xmath34 ) from phase 1 to phase 2 ( resp . from phase 2 to phase 1 ) is time - independent , which assumes that the searcher has no temporal memory and implies an exponential distribution of durations of each phase @xmath35 of mean @xmath36 .",
    "static mode    diffusive mode    ballistic mode    phase 1 denotes the phase of slow motion , during which the target can be detected if it lies within a distance from the searcher which is smaller than a given detection radius @xmath0 , which is the maximum distance within which the searcher can get information about target location .",
    "we propose 3 different modelings of this phase , in order to cover various real life situations ( see figure  [ modes_generic ] ) .    * in the `` static mode '' , the searcher is immobile , and detects the target with probability per unit time @xmath73 if it lies at a distance less than @xmath0 .",
    "* in the second modeling , called the `` diffusive mode '' , the searcher performs a continuous diffusive motion , with diffusion coefficient @xmath30 , and finds immediately the target if it lies at a distance less than @xmath0 . * in the last modeling , called the `` ballistic mode '' , the searcher moves ballistically in a random direction with constant speed @xmath288 and reacts immediately with the target if it lies at a distance less than @xmath0 .",
    "we note that this mode is equivalent to the model of lvy walks searches proposed in @xcite , except for the law of the time between reorientations ( see section  [ subsection_levy ] ) .",
    "it was shown that for destructive search , _",
    "i.e. _ targets that can not be revisited , the optimal strategy is obtained for a straight ballistic motion , without reorientations ( see section  [ subsection_levy ] ) . in what follows",
    "it is shown that if another motion , `` blind '' ( _ i.e. _ without detection ) but with higher velocity is available , there are regimes outperforming the straight line strategy .",
    "some comments on these different modelings of the slow phase 1 are to be made .",
    "first , these three modes schematically cover experimental observations of the behavior of animals searching for food @xcite , where the slow phases of detection are often described as static , random or with slow velocity .",
    "several real situations are also likely to involve a combination of two modes . for instance",
    "the motion of a reactive particle in a cell not bound to motors can be described by a combination of the diffusive and static modes . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "these modes are treated independently , and this approach can therefore be considered as a limit of more realistic models . finally , combining these three schematic modes covers a wide range of possible motions , from subdiffusive ( even static ) , diffusive , to superdiffusive ( even ballistic ) . beyond the modeling of real - life systems ,",
    "studying different detection modes enables us to assess the robustness of the results .",
    "the phase 2 denotes the fast phase during which the target can not be found . in this phase ,",
    "the searcher performs a ballistic motion at a constant speed @xmath32 in a random direction , redrawn for each new phase 2 , independently of previous phases . in real examples correlations between successive ballistic phases",
    "could exist , as observed for foraging animals @xcite .",
    "if correlations are very high , it is close to a one dimensional problem with all the phases 2 in the same direction , a different problem already treated in section [ section_animaux_2005 ] .",
    "we consider here the limit of low correlation , that is of a searcher with no memory skills .",
    "we assume that the searcher evolves in a @xmath5-dimensional spherical domain of radius @xmath78 , with reflective boundaries and with one centered immobile target of radius @xmath0 . as the searcher does not initially know the target s location , we start the walk from a random point of the @xmath5-dimensional sphere , and average the mean target detection time over the initial position .",
    "this geometry models the case of a single target in a finite domain , and also provides a good approximation of an infinite space with regularly spaced targets .",
    "such regular array of targets corresponds to a mean - field approximation of random distributions of targets , which can be more realistic in some experimental situations .",
    "we explain here the general methods , and introduce the notations .",
    "we define @xmath289 the probability that the searcher has not yet found the target at @xmath18 , _ starting _ from @xmath290 in state @xmath35 , where state @xmath291 is the slow motion phase with detection and state @xmath292 is the fast motion phase without target detection .",
    "note that in dimension one , the space coordinate will be denoted by @xmath39 , and in the case of a ballistic mode for phase 1 , the upper index in @xmath293 stands for ballistic motion with direction @xmath294 .",
    "the survival probability @xmath289 is solution of the following standard backward differential chapman - kolmogorov equations @xcite : @xmath295 with @xmath296 when @xmath297 , and 0 else , and @xmath298 is the adjoint operator of the transport operator .",
    "for example @xmath299 for diffusion and @xmath300 for a ballistic motion of velocity @xmath301 .",
    "the mean first passage time to the target @xmath302 for a searcher _ starting _ in the phase @xmath35 from point @xmath303 is then given by  : @xmath304    consequently , for each phase @xmath35 , @xmath302 is solution of : @xmath305 we assume that the searcher starts in phase 1 , and to take into account the fact that it does not initially know the target s location , we average the mean detection time over the starting point , leading to the following definition of the mean search time  : @xmath306 with @xmath226 the d - dimensional sphere of radius @xmath78 and @xmath307 its volume . unless specified , we will consider the low target density limit @xmath91 .",
    "our general aim is to minimize @xmath308 as a function of the mean durations @xmath309 of each phase , and in particular to determine under which conditions an intermittent strategy ( with finite @xmath274 ) is faster than a usual single state search in the phase 1 only , which is given by the limit @xmath310 . in the static mode ,",
    "intermittence is necessary for the searcher to move , and is therefore always favorable . in the diffusive mode",
    ", we will compare the mean search time with intermittence @xmath308 to the mean search time for a single state diffusive searcher @xmath311 , and define the gain as @xmath312 .",
    "similarly in the ballistic mode , we will compare @xmath308 to the mean search time for a single state ballistic searcher @xmath313 and define the gain as @xmath314 .",
    "the upper index `` opt '' is used to denote the value of a parameter or variable at the minimum of @xmath308 .",
    "calculations are exact in dimension one , whereas approximation schemes ( which can be checked numerically ) are needed in dimension two and three .",
    "the main calculation steps are given in appendix and further technical details can be found in @xcite .",
    "we now summarize the main results for each dimension .",
    "besides the fact that it involves more tractable calculations , the one - dimensional case is also interesting to model real search problems . as discussed before , at the microscopic scale ,",
    "tubular structures of cells such as axons or dendrites in neurons can be considered as one - dimensional @xcite .",
    "the active transport of reactive particles , which alternate between diffusion phases and ballistic phases when bound to molecular motors , can be schematically captured by this generic model with diffusive mode @xcite . at the macroscopic scale , one could cite animals like ants @xcite which tend to follow tracks or one - dimensional boundaries .",
    "more generally , borderlines between different habitats , such as a shoreline , can be considered as one - dimensional .",
    "it is showed in appendix that intermittent search strategies in dimension one share similar features for the static , diffusive and ballistic detection modes . in particular , all modes show regimes where intermittence is favorable and lead to a minimization of the search time .",
    "strikingly , the optimal duration of the non - reactive relocation phase 2 is quite independent of the modeling of the reactive phase  : @xmath315 for the static mode , for the ballistic mode ( in the regime @xmath316 ) , and for the diffusive mode ( in the regime @xmath317 and @xmath318 ) .",
    "this shows the robustness of the optimal value @xmath319 .      as discussed previously ,",
    "the two - dimensional problem is particularly well suited to model animal behaviors ; it is also relevant to the microscopic scale , since it mimics for example the case of cellular traffic on membranes@xcite .",
    "while in dimension one the mean search time can be calculated analytically , in dimension two ( and later in dimension three ) approximation schemes are necessary , and can be checked by numerical simulations .",
    "remarkably , for the three different modes of detection ( static , diffusive and ballistic ) , there is a regime where intermittence minimizes the search time for one and the same @xmath319 , given by @xmath320 . as in dimension one",
    ", this indicates that optimal intermittent strategies are robust and widely independent of the details of the description of the detection mechanism .",
    "the three dimensional case is also relevant to biology . at the microscopic scale",
    ", it corresponds for example to intracellular traffic in the bulk cytoplasm of cells , or at larger scales to animals living in dimension three , such as plankton @xcite , or _",
    "c.elegans _ in its natural habitat ( soil ) @xcite . as it was the case in dimension two ,",
    "different assumptions have to be made to obtain analytical expressions of the search time .",
    "such assumptions can be checked by numerical simulations using the same algorithms as in dimension two .",
    "for the three possible modelings of the detection mode ( static , diffusive and ballistic ) in dimension three , there is a regime where the optimal strategy is intermittent .",
    "remarkably , and as was the case in dimensions one and two , the optimal time to spend in the fast non - reactive phase 2 is independent of the modeling of the detection mode and reads @xmath321 .",
    "additionally , while the mean first passage time to the target scales as @xmath322 , the optimal values of the durations of the two phases do not depend on the target density @xmath323 .      to summarize , the methods of calculation developed in this section allow one to show that the mean search time of intermittent random walks can be minimized under broad conditions .",
    "the table [ recapgeneral ] summarizes the main results of this minimization .",
    "this study shows that the optimal durations of the two phases and the gain of intermittent search ( as compared to a single state search ) do depend on the target density in dimension one",
    ". in particular , the gain can be very high at low target concentration .",
    "interestingly , this dependence is smaller in dimension two , and vanishes in dimension three .",
    "the fact that intermittent search is more advantageous in low dimensions ( 1 and 2 ) can be understood as follows . at large scale , the intermittent searcher effectively performs a random walk , and therefore scans a space of dimension two . in an environment of dimension one ( and marginally of dimension two ) , the searcher therefore oversamples the space , and it is favorable to perform large jumps to go to previously unexplored areas . on the contrary , in dimension three , the random walk is transient , and the searcher on average always scans previously unexplored areas , which makes large jumps less beneficial .    additionally , these results show that , for various modeling choices of the slow reactive phase , there is one and the same optimal duration of the fast non reactive phase , which depends only on the space dimension .",
    "this further supports the robustness of optimal intermittent search strategies .",
    "such robustness and efficiency could explain why intermittent trajectories are observed so often , and in various forms .",
    "far from closing the problem , the generic model presented previously opens interesting perspectives . in this section ,",
    "we highlight a few promising directions : ( i ) influence of the targets distribution ; ( ii ) taking into account a more involved searcher , enjoying now some orientational and temporal memory .",
    "indeed , in the generic model of section [ section_generic ] , the searcher has minimal memory skills .",
    "on the one hand , the phase duration distribution is exponential , which means that there is no temporal memory : the effect of other duration distributions is studied in section [ section_autres_temps ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the direction of each new ballistic `` blind '' phase is taken at random , independently of the previous phases , meaning that there is no orientational memory : we study the effect of correlations in section [ section_correlations ] .",
    "( iii ) moving targets , which can be more realistic both at the microscopic and macroscopic scale .",
    "next , we briefly review in section [ section_autres ] similar models of intermittent search which have been proposed recently in other contexts and finally discuss how further models could also be applied to design efficient searches instead of interpreting biological systems ( see section  [ section_desing ] ) .",
    "we first study the influence of target distribution on the previous results .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we study the one dimensional model of section [ section_animaux_2005 ] .      in the context of foraging animals ,",
    "target distributions are often described as regular , random or patched @xcite ( see figure [ repartition_cibles_fig ] ) . in the models presented in previous sections ,",
    "the chosen geometry can be interpreted as one target in a finite domain , or as an infinite array of regularly spaced targets .",
    "the regular distribution is representative of the real - life case of targets that repel each other , thus being as far from each other as possible .",
    "this distribution is also a mean - field approximation of other distributions .",
    "as the regular distribution has already been studied , let us discuss the other representative distributions .",
    "regular distribution           poissonian distribution           patched distribution    if targets are in patches , for example when they attract each other , when a target is found it is likely that other targets are present in the immediate surroundings .",
    "thus a simple strategy is to switch behavior when a target is encountered , as proposed for example by @xcite .",
    "the search is then in two steps : finding a patch , and exploiting it .",
    "for the first step , previous results are still valid , except for the density of targets which has to be replaced by the density of patches . in the following we focus on the last case of poissonian targets , which corresponds to situations of non - interacting targets .      in the case of a 1 dimensional poissonian distribution of targets ,",
    "the distance between two consecutive targets is exponentially distributed .",
    "except for this change , the other parameters remain as defined in the model of section [ section_animaux_2005 ] .",
    "the mean search time is in general hard to calculate for a poissonian target distribution , which can be seen as frozen disorder .",
    "however , estimates ( for @xmath324 ) can be given in 3 regimes ( see @xcite for details )  :    * in the large ballistic displacements limit ( when @xmath325 ) , two successive diffusive phases can be considered as non - overlapping .",
    "it can be shown that in this regime  : @xmath326 * in the small ballistic displacements limit ( when @xmath327 ) , successive diffusive phases often overlap .",
    "it leads to  : @xmath328 * the most interesting situation is the intermediary regime .",
    "indeed , in the first case ( large ballistic displacements ) , relocations are too long and overshoot the target ; and in the second case ( small ballistic displacements ) , there are often repetitive scans of the same areas . in the intermediary regime , the mean first passage time to the target can be approximated by  : @xmath329 with @xmath330 and @xmath331 .",
    "this last regime enables a discussion of the efficiency of the intermittent search .",
    "the efficiency can be quantified by comparing @xmath332 , the mean search time with intermittence at the minimum with @xmath333 , the mean search time with diffusion alone .",
    "it can be shown that intermittence decreases the search time in the limit of low target density , and that the mean search time is minimized for @xmath233 as small as possible .",
    "the optimization with respect to @xmath274 leads to two regimes , depending on the minimal value of @xmath233 as compared to the previously introduced timescale @xmath65 , characteristic of the searcher .  :    * when @xmath66  : @xmath334 at the optimum , the mean search time is  : @xmath335 and the gain is  : @xmath336 where @xmath337 is the typical time needed to travel in the ballistic mode the distance between two consecutive targets . as we shall see in the following , in this regime",
    "the approximations are very accurate .",
    "* when @xmath70  : @xmath338 at the optimum , the mean search time is  : @xmath339 and the gain is  : @xmath340 as we shall see in the following , the approximations are qualitatively good in this regime , but not as precise as in the other regime .",
    "indeed , the gain obtained here would mean that the mean first passage time to the target is smaller than @xmath341 , which is the minimal mean time to travel to the target ( except if @xmath342 ) .",
    "in fact , as can be seen in figure [ gain ] , simulations show that @xmath343 .",
    "it means that very fast intermittence enables the searcher to retain the best of the two phases  : reactivity of phase 1 and motion of phase 2 .",

    "it shows that the approximations of large and small ballistic displacements are valid in the expected conditions , and the intermediary approximation ( [ poisson_t_inter_ball ] ) correctly reproduces the existence and the position of the minimum of @xmath50 .",
    "figure [ opt ] supports the scaling laws relating @xmath233 and the corresponding optimal waiting time @xmath274 at the optimum .",
    "the exponent 3/4 of the theoretical scaling law ( [ poisson_tau2_tau1gd ] ) for @xmath356 is very well confirmed by the simulations .",
    "this is not the case for the law ( [ poisson_tau2_tau1pt ] ) for @xmath357 , which indicates that the approximations should be handled with care for short waiting times @xmath233 , @xmath274 , although their results are qualitatively correct .",
    "figure [ gain ] shows the gain as a function of @xmath233 in different possible conditions .",
    "it supports the conclusions of the theoretical study , and indeed confirms that the gain due to intermittence can be very important if @xmath358 .      in the case of a poissonian distribution of targets ,",
    "intermittence remains valid as a strategy minimizing the search time .",
    "the optimal strategy still consists in taking @xmath233 as small as possible .",
    "however , @xmath319 is different from the case of regularly spaced targets .",
    "the optimal mean duration of ballistic flights scales as @xmath359 in the limit @xmath360 . in this regime , at the optimum , @xmath361 , with a gain compared to diffusion alone @xmath362 .",
    "the models developed in sections [ section_animaux_2005 ] and [ section_generic ] , are very similar .",
    "the searcher alternates between a slow reactive phase , and a fast ballistic blind phase .",
    "the main difference is that in section [ section_animaux_2005 ] , ballistic phases are always in the same direction , whereas on the contrary , in section [ section_generic ] , the direction of each new ballistic phase , is random and independent of the previous ballistic phase .    in the case of animal trajectories ,",
    "the successive directions of ballistic phases are usually correlated @xcite .",
    "we have considered so far two extremes cases  : no correlation or infinite range correlations . in both cases , there are regimes where intermittence is favorable . however , in the case of infinite range correlations , the shorter the duration of each phase , the smaller the search time .",

    "the mean durations of the phases ( free or bound to the interface ) are the main adjustable parameters enabling to minimize the mean search time , and therefore to maximize the reaction rate .",
    "the main idea is that in the `` teleportation '' approximation ( see section [ section_dna_minimal_model ] ) , after a bulk excursion , the distance between the reactant landing point on the surface and its starting point is larger than the typical distance between targets .",
    "in such a regime , each new bound phase is independent from the previous one , and the trajectory overlap is limited , which enhances the reactivity .",
    "the mean durations of the phases can actually be tuned in real systems .",
    "first , the mean time a reactant remains bound to the interface depends on its affinity with the interface , which could be tuned .",
    "second , the mean time spent in the bulk is mainly controlled by the confinement volume @xcite .",
    "the confinement volume has therefore to be as small as possible , but it should be large enough to make the `` teleportation '' approximation valid .",
    "this constraint defines a critical volume , and can actually be by - passed by applying a hydrodynamic flow parallel to the surface , which makes the teleportation approximation valid even for a very short bulk excursions , provided that the velocity of the flow is high enough ( see figure [ desing_micro ] right ) . in this regime it can be shown @xcite that the reaction rate can be optimized by tuning the affinity of the reactant for the interface in a similar way as in section [ section_dna_minimal_model ] .    at the molecular level , we stress that intermittent transport could also be useful for in vitro chemistry .",
    "indeed , we have shown that intermittent transport naturally pops up in the context of reaction at interfaces , where reactants combine surface diffusion phases and bulk excursions , and could permit to enhance reactivity . in this case , adjusting chemically the typical association time of the reactants with the interface , makes possible to optimize the reaction rate .",
    "intermittent search strategies rely on a simple mechanism  : the searcher alternates between two phases , one during which the target can be detected , but with slow motion , and another of faster motion but without target detection .",
    "this mechanism of intermittence has emerged from the observation of real - life biological searches at various scales . at the macroscopic scale ,",
    "an example is given by animals searching for hidden food , which alternate between fast ballistic relocation phases with no target detection , and phases of slower motion aimed at detecting the target .",
    "a simple model based on this observation permits to show analytically that the mean search time can be minimized as a function of the phases mean duration .",
    "there is one single way to share time between the two phases to find the target as fast as possible .",
    "this intermittent search is then an optimal search strategy . with this respect ,",
    "this model is an alternative to the famous lvy walks model which is optimal only in restrictive conditions .",
    "intermittence is also observed at the microscopic scale .",
    "indeed , for some biochemical reactions in cells , which involve a very low concentration of reactants , reaction pathways are not always simple brownian trajectories .",
    "they can rather be qualified as intermittent , since they combine slow diffusion phases on the one hand , and a second mode of faster transport on the other hand , which can be either a faster diffusion mode as in the case of dna - binding proteins , or a ballistic mode powered by molecular motors in the case of intracellular transport .",
    "analytical models actually show that such intermittent trajectories are very efficient , since they significantly reduce reaction times .",
    "interestingly , it is shown that reaction rates can even be maximized by adjusting simple biochemical parameters .",
    "the gain is small in dimension three , but for lower dimensional structures such as membranes ( 2d ) or polymers or tubular structures ( 1d ) , the gain can be very large at low target concentration . such efficiency  and optimality  could explain why intermittent transport is observed in various forms in the context of reactions in cells .",
    "since these intermittent search strategies are observed at various scales , one could suggest that they constitute a generically efficient search mechanism .",
    "the systematic analysis of a generic model in the framework of intermittent random walks , in 1 , 2 and 3 dimensions , and for three different descriptions of the slow reactive phase , permits to assess quantitatively the robustness of this mechanism .",
    "in fact , this study shows that the optimality of these search strategies is a widely robust result .",
