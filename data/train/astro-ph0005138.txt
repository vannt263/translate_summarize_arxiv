    "dusty tori around active galactic nuclei ( agns ) play an important role in the classification of seyfert galaxies ( antonucci & miller 1985 ; see also antonucci 1993 for a review ) .",
    "seyfert galaxies observed face - on to the torus are recognized as seyfert 1 galaxies ( s1s ) while those observed edge - on are recognized as seyfert 2 galaxies ( s2s ) .",
    "therefore , physical properties of dusty tori are of great interest .",
    "we introduce two statistical studies searching for any systematic differences of viewing angles toward dusty tori among narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) , s1s , and s2s : 1 ) ionization condition of the inner wall of the torus based on high - ionization emission lines ( murayama & taniguchi 1998a , b ) , and 2 ) viewing angle towards the dusty torus based on mid - infrared color ( murayama et al .  2000 ) .",
    "these tests may provide constraints for models of nls1s ( for a review , see boller et al .",
    "1996 ) , especially the viewing - angle - dependent unified model .",
    "optical spectra of agns often show very high - ionization emission lines such as [ fevii ] , [ fex ] , and [ fexiv ] ( the so - called coronal lines ) .",
    "since the inner wall of the torus is exposed to intense radiation from the central engine , it is naturally expected that the wall can be one of the important parts of the high - ionization nuclear emission - line region ( hiner ) ( pier & voit 1995 ) .",
    "if the inner wall is an important part of the hiner , it should be expected that s1s would tend to have more intense hiner emission , because in s2s the inner wall would be obscured by the torus itself .",
    "actually , murayama & taniguchi ( 1998a ) showed that s1s have systematically higher [ fevii ] @xmath16087/[oiii ] @xmath15007 intensity ratios than s2s , while the [ oiii ] @xmath15007 luminosity is almost the same in these two seyfert types .",
    "therefore , the excess [ fevii ] emission in s1s may arise from the inner wall of the torus that can not be seen in s2s , because s2s have tori that are viewed edge - on .    in order to investigate",
    "whether or not nls1s have such excess emission of [ fevii ] , we compiled emission - line spectral data for 11 nls1s from the literature ( see nagao et al .",
    "2000 ) and compared [ fevii]/[oiii ] ratios with those of 21 s1s and 34 s2s ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "[ fevii]/[oiii ] ratios of the nls1s are systematically higher than those of the s2s , but appear to be a little lower than those of the s1s .",
    "if we apply the kolmogrov - smirnov ( ks ) test , the probability that the observed distributions of the nls1s and the s2s originate from the same underlying population is 0.011% , while that for the nls1s and the s1s is 4.7% . though the difference of the distribution between the nls1s and the s1s is unclear statistically , we may conclude that nls1s have an excess of [ fevii ] emission , like the s1s .",
    "because of the anisotropic properties of the dusty torus emission ( e.g. , pier & krolik 1992 , 1993 ) , the emission at @xmath4 10 @xmath3 m is systematically stronger in type 1 agns than in type 2s , while emission at @xmath5 20 @xmath3 m is not significantly different between type 1 and type 2 agns .",
    "recently , murayama et al .",
    "( 2000 ) showed that the flux ratio of the @xmath2 band to the _ iras _ 25 @xmath3 m band ( _ _ l / iras__25 ) can act as an estimate of the viewing angle toward the torus .",
    "s1s have systematically higher _ _",
    "l / iras__25 ratios than s2s because the inner hotter region can been seen in the s1s .",
    "therefore , we investigate _ _ l / iras__25 ratios for nls1s to determine whether nls1s have face - on tori like s1s or edge - on tori like s2s .",
    "we compiled photometric data of @xmath2 and _ iras _",
    "25 @xmath3 m for 9 nls1s , 24 s1s and 5 s2s .",
    "the results are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the distribution of _ _ l / iras__25 ratios of the nls1s seems more like that of the s1s than that of the s2s , although the results are not statistically significant because the sample is not large enough .",
    "the ks probability that the observed distributions of the nls1s and the s2s originate in the same underlying population is 4.9% while that for the nls1s and the s1s is 61.7% .",
    "although the mid - infrared diagnostics give only marginal results , both tests show that the nls1s tend to have properties unlike the s2s .",
    "therefore , we may conclude at least that the nls1s do not have edge - on tori .",
    "it is not clear whether or not there is a difference in viewing angle between the nls1s and the s1s because of the statistically small data sample .",
    "although , of course further observational data is necessary , the present results possibly show that the nls1s have nearly the same properties as the s1s and that the nls1s might have almost the same viewing angle distribution as s1s .",
    "this might support the model of a low - mass central black hole with a high accretion rate for the nls1s .",
    "however , the viewing angle we examined here is that of the dusty torus , not that of the broad - line region ( blr ) disk or the accretion disk . it is still possible that the blr disk of the nls1s is always observed from a smaller viewing angle than that of the normal s1s , if the blr disk is randomly oriented with respect to the torus .",
