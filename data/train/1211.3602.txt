    "in recent years , non - normal distributions have received substantial interest in the statistics literature .",
    "the growing need for more flexible tools to analyze datasets that exhibit non - normal features , including asymmetry , multimodality , and heavy tails , has led to intense development in non - normal model - based methods",
    ". in particular , finite mixtures of skew distributions have emerged as a promising alternative to the traditional gaussian mixture modelling .",
    "they have been successfully applied to numerous datasets from a wide range of fields , including the medical sciences , bioinformatics , environmetrics , engineering , economics , and financial sciences .",
    "some recent applications of multivariate skew normal and skew @xmath0-mixture models include @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the rich literature and active discussion of skew distributions was initiated by the pioneering work of @xcite , in which the univariate skew normal distribution was introduced . following its generalization to the multivariate",
    "skew normal distribution in @xcite , the number of contributions have grown rapidly .",
    "the concept of introducing additional parameters to regulate skewness in a distribution was subsequently extended to other parametric families , yielding the skew elliptical family ; for a comprehensive survey of skew distributions , see , for example , the articles by @xcite , and also the book edited by @xcite .    besides the skew normal distribution , which plays a central role in these developments ,",
    "the skew @xmath0-distribution has also received much attention .",
    "being a natural extension of the @xmath0-distribution , the skew @xmath0-distribution retains reasonable tractability and is more robust against outliers than the skew normal distribution .",
    "finite mixtures of skew normal and skew @xmath0-distributions have been studied by several authors , including @xcite , and @xcite , among others . with the existence of so many proposals , with their various characterizations of skew normal and",
    "skew @xmath0-distributions , it becomes rather unclear how these proposals are related to each other , and to what extent can the subtle differences between them have in practical applications .",
    "this paper provides a concise overview of various recent developments of mixtures of skew normal and skew @xmath0-distributions .",
    "an illustration is given of the performance of mixtures of these distributions and some other skew mixture models in clustering a real dataset .",
    "we first present a systematic classification of multivariate skew normal and skew @xmath0-distributions , with special references to those used in various existing proposals of finite mixture models .",
    "we then illustrate the relative performance of these models and other related algorithms by applications to a real dataset .",
    "recently , @xcite referred to the skew normal and skew @xmath0-distributions of @xcite as ` restricted ' skew distributions , and the class of skew elliptical distributions of @xcite as having the ` unrestricted ' form .",
    "while this terminology was later briefly discussed in @xcite when outlining the equivalence between the skew distributions of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , further details were not given .",
    "this papers aims to fill this gap .",
    "we shall adopt the above terminology , and expand this idea further to classify more general forms of skew distributions , namely , the ` extended ' and ` generalized ' forms .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : classif ] , we present the classification scheme for multivariate skew normal and skew @xmath0-distributions , clarifying the connections between various variants .",
    "next , we discuss the development of currently available algorithms for fitting mixtures of multivariate skew normal and skew @xmath0-distributions in section [ sec : fm ] , pointing out the equivalence between some of these algorithms .",
    "section [ sec : dlbcl ] presents an application to automated flow cytometric analysis , and comparisons are made with the results of other model - based clustering methods .",
    "finally , some concluding remarks are given in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "since the seminal article by @xcite on the multivariate skew normal ( msn ) distribution , numerous ` extensions ' of the so - called skew normal distribution have appeared in rapid succession .",
    "the number of contributions are now so many that it is beyond the scope of this paper to include them all here .",
    "however , most of these developments can be considered as special cases of the fundamental skew normal ( fusn ) distribution @xcite , and can be systematically classified into four types , namely , the restricted , unrestricted , extended , and generalized forms .",
    "we begin by briefly discussing the fusn distribution , since it encompasses the first three forms of msn distributions .",
    "the fusn distribution itself is a generalized form of the msn distribution .",
    "it can be generated by conditioning a multivariate normal variable on another ( univariate or multivariate ) random variable .",
    "suppose @xmath1 and @xmath2 is a @xmath3-dimensional random vector . adopting the notation as used in @xcite , we let @xmath4 be the vector @xmath5 if all elements of @xmath2 are positive and @xmath6 otherwise .",
    "then @xmath7 has a fusn distribution .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath2 is _ not _ necessarily normally distributed , but in the restricted , unrestricted , and extended cases , it is restricted to be a random normal variate .",
    "the parameter @xmath8 , known as the extension parameter , can be viewed as a location shift for the latent variable @xmath2 .",
    "when the joint distribution of @xmath5 and @xmath2 is multivariate normal , the fusn distribution reduces to a location - scale variant of the canonical fusn ( cfusn ) distribution , given by @xmath9 where @xmath10          \\sim n_{q+p } \\left(\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{\\boldsymbol\\tau}\\\\          { \\boldsymbol\\mu}\\end{array}\\right ] ,          \\left[\\begin{array}{cc}{\\boldsymbol\\gamma } & { \\boldsymbol\\delta}^t \\\\          { \\boldsymbol\\delta } &     { \\boldsymbol\\sigma}\\end{array}\\right]\\right ) ,          \\label{eq2.17}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is a @xmath3-dimensional vector , @xmath12 is @xmath13-dimensional vector , @xmath14 is a @xmath15 scale matrix , @xmath16 is an arbitrary @xmath17 matrix , and @xmath18 is a @xmath19 scale matrix .",
    "the restricted case corresponds to a highly specialized form of ( [ eq2.17 ] ) , where @xmath2 is restricted to be univariate ( that is , @xmath20 ) , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 . in the unrestricted case ,",
    "both @xmath2 and @xmath5 have a @xmath13-dimensional normal distribution ( that is , @xmath3=@xmath13 ) .",
    "note that the use of `` restricted '' here refers to restrictions on the random vector in the ( conditioning - type ) stochastic definition of the skew distribution .",
    "it is not a restriction on the parameter space , and so a `` restricted '' form of a skew distribution is not necessarily nested within its corrresponding `` unrestricted '' form .",
    "indeed , the restricted and unrestricted forms coincide in the univariate case .",
    "the extended form has no restriction on the dimensions of @xmath2 , but @xmath11 can be a non - zero vector .",
    "when @xmath2 is not normally distributed , the density of @xmath23 has the generalized form .",
    "a summary of some of the existing multivariate skew normal distributions is given in tables  [ tab:2.1 ] and  [ tab:2.2 ] , where rmsn , umsn , emsn , and gmsn refer to the restricted , unrestricted , extended , and generalized version , respectively , of the multivariate skew normal distribution .",
    "the list is not exhaustive , and the names appearing in the final columns are representative examples only .",
    ".classification of multivariate skew normal distributions . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have presented a schematic way to classify multivariate skew distributions into four types , namely , the ` restricted ' , ` unrestricted ' , ` extended ' and ` generalized ' forms . concerning the use of the terminology ` restricted ' and ` unrestricted ' , it should be noted that the restricted skew forms are not nested within the corresponding unrestricted forms , with these two forms coinciding in the univariate case .",
    "however , these two forms are both special cases of the extended form , which itself is a special case of the generalized form .",
    "current work on finite mixtures of skew distributions has investigated only the restricted and unrestricted forms of multivariate skew distributions .",
    "mixtures based on skew distributions of more general forms would be of interest for further research ."
