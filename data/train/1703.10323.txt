    "recently the lhcb collaboration presented results of analysis of the exclusive decays @xmath10 , and confirmed existence of the resonances @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the @xmath11 invariant mass distribution @xcite .",
    "it also reported on observation of the heavy resonances @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the same @xmath14 channel .",
    "the measured masses and decay widths of these resonances ( hereafter @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively ) read @xmath17the lhcb determined the spin - parities of these resonances , as well .",
    "it turned out , that @xmath18 and @xmath19 are axial - vector states with @xmath20 , whereas the quantum numbers of @xmath21 and @xmath22 are @xmath23 .",
    "the resonances @xmath18 and @xmath19 are old members of the xyz family of exotic states : they were observed by the cdf collaboration aaltonen:2009tz in the decay processes @xmath24 , and later confirmed by cms @xcite and d0 collaborations @xcite , respectively .",
    "the states @xmath21 and @xmath25 are heavier than @xmath26 , and were found for the first time .",
    "all of the @xmath27 resonances may belong to a class of the hidden - charm exotic states . from production mechanisms and decay channels ,",
    "it is clear that as tetraquark candidates they should contain strange quark - antiquark pair @xmath28 . in other words ,",
    "the quark content of the @xmath27 states is @xmath29 .",
    "theoretical interpretations of the @xmath30 and @xmath31 resonances , and suggestions made to understand their internal organization within the tetraquark picture embrace variety of models . among them",
    "most important and popular ones are the models , which consider @xmath30 and @xmath31 as the molecular liu:2008tn , wang:2009ue , albuquerque:2009ak , wang:2009ry , wang:2011uk , liu:2010hf , he:2011ed , finazzo:2011he , hidalgoduque:2012pq or diquark - antidiquak states @xcite .",
    "there are also alternative approaches treating them as dynamically generated resonances @xcite or coupled - channel effects as in ref .",
    "@xcite , for example .",
    "the experimental situation , stabilized after the lhcb report , imposes new constraints on possible models of @xmath27 resonances .",
    "indeed , an analysis carried out by the lhcb collaboration in ref .",
    "@xcite on the basis of the collected experimental information ruled out an explanation of the @xmath18 as @xmath32 or @xmath33 @xmath34 molecular states .",
    "the lhcb also emphasized that molecular bound - states or cusps can not account for @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , in order to explain the experimental data , new models and ideas are suggested .",
    "first of all , there are traditional attempts to describe the @xmath27 resonances as excited states of the conventional charmonium or as dynamical effects . indeed , by analyzing experimental information of the belle and babar collaborations ( see , refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) on the @xmath35 and @xmath36 decays , in ref .",
    "@xcite the author identified the resonances @xmath18 and @xmath37 with the p - wave excited charmonium states @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively ,    the contribution of the rescattering effects to the process @xmath40 was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite aiming to answer a question can they simulate the observed @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 resonances or not .",
    "it was found that the @xmath41 and @xmath42 rescatterings via meson loops may simulate the structures @xmath18 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "but , description of the @xmath19 and @xmath21 states as rescattering effects seem are problematic , which implies that they could be real four - quark resonances .",
    "nevertheless , on the basis of some other arguments ( see , for details ref.@xcite ) the author did not exclude treating of @xmath19 as the excited @xmath38 state of the conventional charmonium .",
    "the diquark - antidiquark and molecule - like models prevail other pictures and form a theoretical basis for numerous calculations to account for available information on the @xmath27 resonances chen:2016oma , chen:2010ze , wang:2016tzr , wang:2016dcb , wang:2016gxp .",
    "thus , the the masses of the axial - vector @xmath3 diquark - antidiquark @xmath2[\\bar c\\bar s]$ ] states with the triplet and sextet color structures were calculated in ref .",
    "recently , in the light of the experimental data of the lhcb collaboration , they were interpreted as the @xmath18 and @xmath19 resonances , respectively @xcite . within the same approach",
    "the @xmath21 and @xmath22 states were considered as the @xmath43-wave excitations of the their light counterparts @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xcite .    in the context of tetraquark models",
    "the resonances @xmath30 and @xmath31 were studied in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , as well . in accordance with ref .",
    "@xcite the light @xmath18 resonance can not be considered as the diquark - antidiquark compact state .",
    "the similar conclusion was made in respect of @xmath19 , which was examined as a octet - octet type molecule - like state : the mass of the @xmath31 resonance found there was in agreement with the lhcb data , but its decay width overshot considerably the experimental result @xcite .",
    "the scalar resonance @xmath21 was considered as the first radial excitation of the axial - vector diquark - antidiquark @xmath44 state , whereas @xmath45 was analyzed as the ground state of the @xmath2[\\bar{c}\\bar{s}]$ ] tetraquark built of the vector diquark and antidiquark @xcite . here",
    "some comments about @xmath44 are in order .",
    "it was registered by the belle collaboration as a resonance in the @xmath46 invariant mass distribution at the exclusive decay @xmath47 abe:2004zs , and also seen in the reaction @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "this resonance was confirmed by the babar collaboration in the same @xmath47 process aubert:2007vj .",
    "the @xmath44 was traditionally interpreted as the scalar @xmath49 meson @xmath50 . but a lack of its expected @xmath51 decay modes gave rise to other conjectures .",
    "thus , an alternative assumption concerning the @xmath44 resonance was made in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was identified with the lightest scalar @xmath2[\\bar{c}\\bar{s}]$ ] tetraquark state .",
    "namely , this resonance was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite as the ground state of @xmath21 .",
    "calculations seem confirm suggestions made on the nature of the @xmath21 and @xmath22 resonances @xcite .    an abundance of the observed charmonium - like resonances necessitated spectroscopic analysis of the diquark - antidiquark states , which resulted in suggestion of various multiplets to systemize the discovered tetraquarks ( see , refs .",
    "the @xmath27 resonances were included into @xmath52 and @xmath53 multiplets of color triplet @xmath2_{s=0,1}[\\overline{c}% \\overline{s}]_{\\overline{s}=0,1}$ ] tetraquarks @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath18 was identified with the @xmath54 level of the @xmath52 ground - state multiplet .",
    "the @xmath19 resonance is supposedly , a linear superposition of two states with @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "this suggestion was made , because in the multiplet of the color triplet tetraquarks only one state can bear the quantum numbers @xmath54 .",
    "the heavy resonances @xmath21 and @xmath22 are included into the @xmath53 multiplet as its @xmath55 members . but apart from the color triplet multiplets there may exist a multiplet of the color sextet tetraquarks @xcite , which also contains a state with @xmath54 .",
    "in other words , the multiplet of the color sextet tetraquarks doubles a number of the states with the same spin - parity @xcite , and the @xmath31 resonance may be identified with its @xmath54 member .",
    "even from this brief survey it is evident , that in the context of the diquark - antidiquark model there exist different , sometimes contradictory suggestions concerning the internal structure of the @xmath27 resonances .",
    "moreover , almost in all of these investigations the spectroscopic parameters of newly discovered states were found by means of qcd two - point sum rule method .",
    "predictions of the sum rules for the parameters of the exotic states extracted by using various assumptions on the interpolating currents , within theoretical errors are consistent with the experimental data . in most of cases results of various works are in accord with each other , as well .",
    "in other words , the static parameters of the exotic states , such as their masses , meson - current couplings do not provide an information sufficient to verify existing models by confronting them with experimental data or / and alternative theoretical models .",
    "the additional information useful in such cases can be gained from investigation of decay channels of the exotic states .",
    "the qcd sum rule is the powerful nonperturbative method to explore the exclusive hadronic processes and calculate parameters of hadrons , including widths of their strong decays .",
    "the widths of the decay channels can be computed by applying either the three - point sum rule approach or the light - cone sum rule ( lcsr ) method @xcite .",
    "the tetraquark states dominantly decay to two conventional mesons . in the present work",
    "we will study namely such decay modes of the @xmath30 and @xmath31 resonances .",
    "calculation of the couplings corresponding to strong vertices of a tetraquark and two mesons in the context of the lcsr method requires usage of additional technical tools .",
    "the reasons for a distinct treatment of vertices with tetraquarks are very simple : because these states are composed of four valence quarks , the light - cone expansion of the relevant non - local correlation function in terms of meson distribution amplitudes unavoidably reduces to expressions with local matrix elements of the same meson . as a result ,",
    "conservation of the four - momentum in a such strong vertex is fulfilled only if the four - momentum of this meson is set equal to zero .",
    "the emerged situation can be handled by invoking into analysis technical tools , known as a soft - meson approximation @xcite .",
    "for investigation of the diquark - antidiquark states the soft - meson approximation was adapted in ref .",
    "@xcite , and successfully applied to analyze decays some of the tetraquarks in refs .",
    "agaev:2016ijz , agaev:2016lkl , agaev:2016urs .    in the present work",
    "we explore the properties of the @xmath18 and @xmath19 resonances in the context of qcd sum rule method .",
    "we are going to interpolate @xmath30 and @xmath31 , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , by the spin - parity @xmath54 currents with the antisymmetric and symmetric color structures , respectively . by accepting this scheme",
    "we suggest that there exist two different ground - state multiplets of triplet - triplet and sextet - sextet type tetraquarks , and the @xmath18 and @xmath19 resonances are their members with the same @xmath54 .",
    "correctness of this hypothesis can be checked by computing the masses of @xmath18 and @xmath19 states , and , what is more important , their decay widths @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the masses and meson - current couplings of @xmath30 and @xmath31 will computed by utilizing the two - point qcd sum rule approach .",
    "we will also analyze the vertices @xmath59 , @xmath60 and calculate the strong couplings @xmath61 and @xmath62 by means of the light - cone sum rule method employing the soft - meson technique . obtained results",
    "will enable us to find the widths of the @xmath63 and @xmath64 decays .",

    "<S> investigation of the resonances @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which were recently confirmed by the lhcb collaboration @xcite , is carried out by treating them as the color triplet and sextet @xmath2[\\bar{c}\\bar { s}]$ ] diquark - antidiquark states with the spin - parity @xmath3 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the masses and meson - current couplings of these tetraquarks in the context of qcd two - point sum rule method by taking into account the quark , gluon and mixed vacuum condensates up to eight dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the vertices @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and evaluate corresponding strong couplings @xmath6 and @xmath7 by means of qcd light - cone sum rule method , and a technique of the soft - meson approximation . in turn , these couplings contain a required information to determine the width of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 decay channels . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our results for the masses and decay widths of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 resonances with the lhcb data , and alternative theoretical predictions . </S>"
