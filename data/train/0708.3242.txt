    "since grbs are induced by relativistic jets , grb - sne are also expected to be aspherical .",

    "this is an area that has not been studied in great depth , despite its importance . although some works have addressed the properties of the light curve ( lc ) or the late phase spectra of aspherical sne ( e.g. , hflich et al .",

    "in order to study the detailed properties of the radiation from aspherical sne , we have unified a supernova multi - dimensional radiative transfer code ` samurai ` . `",
    "samurai `  is a combination of 3d codes adopting monte - carlo methods to compute the bolometric lc ( maeda et al .",
    "2006c ) , and the spectra of sne from early ( tanaka et al . 2006 ) to late phases ( maeda et al .",
    "the lcs are computed as pioneered by cappellaro et al .",
    "our 3d lc code adopts individual packet method as described by lucy ( 2005 ) and additionally , includes multi - energy transfer for high energy photons ( maeda 2006b ) .",
    "the early phase spectra are calculated as snapshots in the optically thin atmosphere , using the results of the lc simulation as initial conditions .",
    "a sharply defined photosphere is assumed as an inner boundary for simplicity .",
    "the position of the inner boundary in each direction is determined by averaging the positions of the last scattering photon packets ( see fig .",
    "3 of maeda et al .",
    "thus , the inner boundary corresponds to an optical depth of roughly unity .",
    "the luminosity at the inner boundary ( @xmath14 ) is also taken from the lc computation by integrating the energy of photon packets escaping from each @xmath15 bin .",
    "for the computation of ionization and excitation state in the atmosphere , the local physical process same as in the previous 1d code ( mazzali & lucy 1993 ; mazzali 2000 ) , which is used to model spectra of sne of various types ( e.g. , mazzali et al . 1993 ) , is adopted .",
    "line scattering under the sobolev approximation and electron scattering are taken into account .",
    "for line scattering , the effect of photon branching is included as in lucy ( 1999 ) .",
    "beginning with a trial temperature structure , a number of photon packets ( typically @xmath16 ) are followed in 3d space , giving the flux in each mesh . then the temperature structure is updated . after the temperature structure converges ,",
    "the spectra are obtained by counting the energy ( or wavelength ) distribution of escaping photon packets in every direction .",
    "since the background model is axially symmetric , it is not necessary to follow the propagation in the azimuthal direction explicitly .",
    "we use a 2d grid ( @xmath17 ) , but still perform the transport of the photon packets in 3d , reproducing photon propagation in the azimuthal direction by projecting the photon back on the 2d plane of the calculation .",

    "the emergent luminosity is also anisotropic , being brighter by a factor of 1.2 in the polar direction ( maeda et al .",
    "in contrast , the local luminosity at the photosphere , @xmath14 , is highly aspherical , with an axis ratio of 6.3 , tracing the aspherical @xmath6ni  distribution . at this epoch",
    ", the photosphere is still outside the region where explosive nucleosynthesis occurs .",
    "the metal lines in the spectrum result from pre - explosion abundance in the c+o layer .",
    "the upper left panel of figure [ fig : tempiond20 ] shows the calculated temperature structure .",
    "the boosted luminosity makes the temperature near the z - axis higher than in the equatorial plane by @xmath21 k. this anisotropy of the temperature causes anisotropies of the ionization structure .",

    "all absorption lines except for @xmath256355 are stronger for larger @xmath15 , i.e. , for an equatorial view .",

    "the local luminosity and the temperature structure are still anisotropic , although the photosphere is almost spherical ( upper left panel of fig . [",
    "fig : tempiond30 ] ) .",
    "consequently , the distribution of ionization fractions is also aspherical ( see fig . [",
    "fig : tempiond30 ] , upper right and lower left panels , for the case of ca ) .",
    "however , the emergent spectra are not significantly different for different viewing angles ( fig .",
    "[ fig : specall ] ) .",
    "this is the effect of the aspherical abundance distribution .",
    "the photosphere at this epoch is located inside the region where heavy elements are synthesized in the explosion . since nucleosynthesis occurs entirely near the polar direction in our model , the suppression of important ions near the z - axis",
    "is compensated by the larger abundance of the heavy elements ( see fig . [",
    "fig : tempiond30 ] , lower right panel ) .",
    "days than at @xmath20 days because of more efficient absorption both near the photosphere ( @xmath28 km  s@xmath29 , a lower velocity than at @xmath20 days ) and at high velocity ( @xmath30 km  s@xmath29 , where the temperature is lower and the fraction is higher than at @xmath20 days ) . ]",
    "only the @xmath255890 line is stronger for larger @xmath15 because of the combined effect of the lower temperature that favors and the higher abundance of na , which is predominantly synthesized before the explosion .    given the strong anisotropy in @xmath14 , the side - viewed spectrum of model a20 consists mainly of photons escaping from the ejecta of @xmath31 . since physical quantities there ( e.g. , isotropic mass and kinetic energy of the ejecta in that direction , and @xmath14 ) are similar to those of model f20 , the spectrum of model f20 is similar to the polar - viewed spectrum of model a20 .",
    "model f50 shows a very strong @xmath255890 line owing to the low temperature .",
    "[ fig : tempiond30 ] ]",
    "the spectra computed for the aspherical model a20 are compared with those of sn 1998bw in figure [ fig : specp ] .",
    "because of the detection of grb 980425 , it is tempting to compare the polar - viewed spectrum ( red lines ) with that of sn 1998bw . since the computed lc is brighter than the observation by a factor of 1.25 at @xmath32 days ( maeda et al .",
    "2006c ) , the synthetic spectra at @xmath32 days are scaled _",
    "after _ the computation by this factor in figure [ fig : specp ] .    at @xmath20 days ( fig .",
    "[ fig : specp ] , upper panel ) , the scaled synthetic spectrum of model a20 with @xmath22 does not show the broad absorption trough between 4000 and 5000  that is typical of hypernovae such as sn 1998bw .",
    "this is because in the model fe - line absorption is not effective at high velocities , making it possible for photons to escape effectively near 4500 .",
    "similarly , the - absorption at 7000  8000    is very weak in model a20 .",
    "the si line velocity in the model is , however , comparable to that in sn 1998bw .    at @xmath27 days ( fig .",
    "[ fig : specp ] , lower panel ) , the and lines are somewhat stronger , although the - absorption at 7000  8000   is still narrower than in the observed spectrum .",
    "the peaks around 4000 and 4500   are partially suppressed for a polar view by the high velocity absorption by the extended fe near the jet , while they are strong in the synthetic spectrum for the equatorial view .",
    "the suppression of the peaks is similarly seen in the spectrum of sn 1998bw .",
    "the @xmath255890 line is very weak in sn 1998bw , in analogy with the spectrum with @xmath33 .",
    "the strengths of the and lines at @xmath20 days can be increased if heavy elements synthesized in the explosion are mixed to outer layers . in sn explosions , rayleigh - taylor (",
    "r - t ) instabilities are expected to occur , which could deliver the newly synthesized elements to higher velocities .",
    "we simulate this possibility by introducing a parameter , the mixing fraction @xmath34 .",
    "if the mass ejected inside a conical section of the ejecta is @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the mass of a certain element contained in the conical section , we simulate mixing by taking a fraction ( @xmath34 ) of the mass of a newly synthesized element and distributing this mass homogeneously in the conical section .",
    "thus , in the outer layers , the newly synthesized element will have an abundance @xmath37 ( + pre - sn abundance ) . in the deeper region ,",
    "the abundances are redistributed by a mixing down of the unburned material .    in figure",
    "[ fig : specp ] , synthetic spectra of models with @xmath38 ( model a20p0.2 ) are shown . at @xmath20 days ( the synthetic spectra",
    "are similarly scaled , upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : specp ] ) , although the absorption line at 7000 - 8000   is still weaker than the observation , the fe lines are strong , causing the broad absorption at @xmath39   followed by the peak at @xmath0 5200  . at @xmath27 days , the strong feature contributes to the broad absorption at 7000 - 8000  , which is comparable to that in sn 1998bw .    although the agreement of the spectra is far from perfect , the spectra of the model with mixing are in qualitative agreement with those of sn 1998bw . since we use multi - dimensional hydrodynamic and nucleosynthetic models , which are computed ab initio , there are not many parameters that we can freely control .",
    "the agreement could be improved by additional modifications , but they would be complicated and are beyond the scope of this work . note that our input luminosity is higher than that of sn 1998bw at @xmath20 days , making the ejecta temperature too high .",
    "if a luminosity comparable to that of sn 1998bw is used , neglecting the possible displacement of the photosphere , the - feature becomes as strong as the observation .",
    "even in this case , however , mixing with @xmath40 is still required .     and scaled assuming @xmath41 . _",

    "we have presented the first detailed simulations of the early phase optical spectra of realistic jet - like hypernova models .",
    "the emergent spectrum is different for different viewing angles .",
    "the spectral properties are determined by the combination of aspherical abundances and anisotropic ionization states .",

    "the kinetic energy of an aspherical model that reproduces , at least qualitatively , the spectra of sn 1998bw ( @xmath46 ) can be smaller than that of a well - fitting spherical model ( @xmath10 ) .",

    "sne similar to sn 1998bw in ejecta mass , kinetic energy and @xmath6ni  mass should always show spectral features of `` hypernovae '' or `` broad line supernovae '' , but with some differences as described above , depending on the viewing angle .",
