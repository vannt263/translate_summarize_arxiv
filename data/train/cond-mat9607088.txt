    "man - tailored semiconductor heterostructures @xcite offer , for the first time , the possibility to test quantum mechanics at a mesoscopic level @xcite .",
    "the scenario of systems which can be investigated is so rich that the art of their realization deserves the name of quantum design .    in the simplest case",
    ", a quantum designer can grow sandwiches of different semiconductor alloys by choosing the number of atomic layers for each kind of alloy . in the resulting heterostructure , the conduction band profile along the growth direction forms steps whose height can be continuously varied by a proper choice of the alloy composition .",
    "typical widths and heights are of the order of tens of   and tenths of ev , respectively .    at low - temperature ,",
    "the mean free path of carriers for scattering from crystal impurities is of the order of @xmath0   and for heterostructures smaller than this size the electric transport along the growth direction is a phase coherent quantum scattering from the conduction band discontinuities @xcite .",
    "due to the translational invariance in the plane orthogonal to the growth direction , the problem is one - dimensional .",
    "moreover , the carriers are described by an effective mass which accounts for the microscopic scattering with the periodic crystal sites and their wave function is an envelope wave function @xcite .    in a homogeneous neutral conductor",
    ", the electron - electron interaction can be taken into account by a renormalization of the carrier effective masses @xcite and one deals with a transport problem like in a noninteracting case . in a heterostructure ,",
    "even as simple as that described above , the breaking of translational invariance in the transport direction allows the electric neutrality to be locally violated .",
    "the corresponding interaction potential , obtained , at hartree level , by solving a proper poisson equation , can strongly modify the transport properties .",
    "the example of a double barrier heterostructure with the exterior regions doped with donors is illuminating @xcite . due to tunneling",
    ", electrons populate the resonance(s ) created by the double barrier and the region between the barriers becomes negatively charged .",
    "this generates an electric potential which decreases the tunneling probability of electrons in the double barrier region . as a consequence , current oscillations on the picosecond scale @xcite and chaotic behavior without classical counterpart",
    "@xcite have been predicted in a ballistic configuration in which electrons are injected at some chosen energy .",
    "experiments with ballistic electrons are difficult and measurements became available only recently @xcite .",
    "technologically simpler is the case of biased heterostructures where transport is due to the presence of reservoirs at thermal equilibrium with different chemical potentials .",
    "manifestations of the electron - electron interaction are known also in this configuration .",
    "for example , hysteresis in the current - voltage characteristics of double barrier heterostructures have been observed @xcite and recognized as a consequence of the accumulation of electrons in the resonance @xcite . in this case , however , one has the theoretical problem of attaching reservoirs at thermal equilibrium to a piece of conductor where quantum coherent transport takes place .    in the recent paper @xcite we proposed an approach to this problem based on a mathematical method earlier applied in the framework of ballistic transport @xcite .",
    "we showed that for heterostructures with a single resonance our approach allows one _ i ) _ to obtain steady - state voltage - current characteristics having hysteresis or not in agreement with the experimental results @xcite and _ ii ) _ to predict time - dependent properties analogous to those studied in optically bistable systems @xcite . here , we develop the general mathematical scheme of this approach and discuss the case with several resonances where multistability phenomena can take place as in superlattices @xcite .    for simplicity , consider the one - dimensional double barrier heterostructure discussed above .",
    "the idea is that due to the presence of resonances the corresponding schrdinger problem can be divided in two parts : a schrdinger equation for the barrier region and one for the exterior space , the two being weakly coupled by tunneling .",
    "this decomposition corresponds to the schematization of the transport process as a coherent process fed by reservoirs . in the exterior space ( reservoirs )",
    "homogeneous and neutral , the electron - electron interaction is neglected and thermal equilibrium is taken into account by considering a continuous set of energy eigenstates distributed according to the fermi statistics . in the barrier region ( coherent conductor ) , the coulomb interaction is included in a self - consistent potential obtained by solving the poisson equation associated to the local charge density . under the assumption that the barriers are wide enough ,",
    "the corresponding nonlinear schrdinger problem is discussed in two steps . in the first step",
    "we eliminate the potential well between the two barriers , by artificially increasing the potential there , and we solve the schrdinger equation asymptotically for the new potential by means of wkb - expansions . the resulting solution is then very small near the ( filled ) potential well , so we get only a small error in the schrdinger equation when we go back to the true potential . in the second step we correct for this small error by adding a wave function concentrated near the potential well . assuming a priori that the charge in the well changes slowly with time",
    ", the correcting wave function can be expected to be large only at energies close to the resonances , and be well approximated by some linear combination of the resonant states .    in most of the paper",
    "we discuss the case in which only one resonance participates .",
    "the validity of this one - mode approximation has been tested numerically with excellent results in the ballistic configuation of @xcite .",
    "here , the coefficient of the one - mode approximation obeys an ordinary differential equation with respect to time in the infinite dimensional space of square integrable functions of energy .",
    "we study the stationary points of the corresponding vector field and their nature , whether they are attractive or not , and arrive at quite neat answers . for solutions of the dynamical system which have existed as bounded solutions for a long time and in a suitable asymptotic limit ( of wide barriers )",
    "we derive a simplified scalar differential equation for the evolution of the sheet density of electrons trapped in well which gives good global understanding of the more complete dynamical system . using these results , we are able to discuss the phenomenon of hysteresis and we support and illustrate the discussion with several numerical results .",
    "the discussion includes the evolution of solutions away from fixed points which necessarily appears when there is hysteresis .",
    "we also discuss the case of several resonances , and get analogous results .    from the mathematical point of view",
    ", the present paper could be a starting point for rigorous work on some fresh problems , involving semiclassical analysis , adiabatic theory , non - linear schrdinger equations and dynamical systems .",
    "a strong motivation for such an enterprise is the fact that the theory of electric transport in semiconductor devices offers many problems similar to that one we illustrate here @xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ 2 ] we define the model . in section",
    "[ 3 ] we review the wkb expansion for slowly varying potentials . in sections [ 4 ] and [ 5 ]",
    "we determine the driving term and the ground resonant state , respectively , within the wkb approximation .",

    ". a qualitative discussion of the hysteresis phenomenon in comparison with numerical results is given in section [ 10 ] .",
    "in section [ 11 ] we finally consider the case with several resonances .",
