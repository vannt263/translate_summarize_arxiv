    "almost half of all fgk stars are in multiple systems  @xcite . therefore , it is important to understand the role that stellar companions play in the formation and evolution of planetary systems .",
    "in addition , ongoing transit surveys have demonstrated that a majority of apparently single stars host planets , and have provided unprecedented new opportunities to compare the properties of planets located in binary star systems to those of single stars  @xcite .",
    "the recent proliferation of high contrast imaging of planet hosting stars is closely linked with the _ kepler _ mission , as this survey was the first to produce large numbers of transiting planet candidates for which radial velocity confirmation was impractical . for these systems ,",
    "high contrast imaging is required in order to eliminate astrophysical false positives and to correct for dilution of transit light curves . prior to _ kepler _ , the first reports of stellar companions came from serendipitous discoveries from newly obtained high contrast images or archival images reported along with the planet discovery  ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "then , `` lucky imaging '' techniques  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) used adaptive optics ( ao ) to perform systematic surveys with small sample sizes and modest sensitivity .",
    "more recently , there have been a series of larger ao surveys targeting _ kepler _",

    "a full review of these campaigns can be found in  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we continue the search for stellar companions in systems with hot jupiters transiting fgk stars in order to explore the potential role of these companions in planet formation and migration .",
    "the `` friends of hot jupiters '' ( fohj ) campaign  @xcite , has searched for planetary and stellar companions to a sample of 50 hot jupiter hosts via radial velocity monitoring  @xcite , infrared spectral model comparison  @xcite and direct imaging  @xcite .",
    "this original survey sample contained two subpopulations : stars that host planets with some dynamical signature of multi - body interactions , such as a measured offset between the orientation of the planet s orbit and the host star s spin axis or a non - zero orbital eccentricity , and stars that host planets on well - aligned orbits and with orbital eccentricities consistent with zero to three sigma .",
    "our direct imaging survey was the first to apply a statistical approach to estimate the fraction of hot jupiter host stars with gravitationally bound stellar companions including a correction for survey sensitivity .",
    "we found a stellar companion rate of @xmath6 in the 50 - 2000@xmath1 region , showing moderately significant ( @xmath7 ) evidence for a larger companion fraction around solar - type hot jupiter hosts than solar - type field stars .",
    "our survey was also the first to systematically examine a sample of planets with spin - orbit measurements , allowing us to compare misaligned and well - aligned systems .",
    "we found no evidence for a correlation between the presence of an outer stellar or planetary companion in these systems and the orbital properties of the inner transiting hot jupiter .",
    "more recently , there have been four large direct imaging surveys for companions to transiting gas giant planet hosts  @xcite .",
    "@xcite applied stellar density arguments to estimate that 12 out of their 49 targets have bound companions while @xcite report candidate companions around 33 out of 74 systems .",
    "although these studies do not confirm common proper motion or report a survey sensitivity corrected companion rate , their raw companion fractions are consistent with ours . @xcite and @xcite did check for common proper motion and correct for survey sensitivity .",
    "@xcite report a stellar multiplicity rate for _ kepler _ hot jupiter hosts to be @xmath8 and @xcite found a companion rate of @xmath9 .",
    "both of these results are in good agreement with our previously published value .",
    "although the higher binary fraction of hot jupiter host stars suggests these stellar companions play a role in the creation of hot jupiters , it is unclear exactly what this role might be . in one class of scenarios , the presence of a stellar companion might cause gas giant planets formed at larger separations to migrate inward via secular interactions such as the kozai - lidov effect  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if stellar kozai is the dominant migration mechanism , it should result in a population of hot jupiters with a broad distribution of orbital inclinations that is closely correlated with the presence of companions .",
    "however , our earlier direct imaging survey finds no correlation between the orbital properties of the transiting planet and stellar multiplicity , suggesting that kozai - lidov migration is probably not the dominant channel for the generation of hot jupiter spin - orbit misalignment .",
    "instead , our results signal broad agreement with the primordial excitation of stellar obliquities  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in an alternative scenario , we consider the possibility that stellar binaries are more favorable locations for the formation of gas giant planets .",
    "some previous studies suggested that stellar companions might suppress gas giant planet formation by exciting planetesimal velocity dispersions  @xcite , truncating the disk  @xcite , or ejecting newly formed planets  @xcite .",
    "other theoretical studies , however , have shown that disk self - gravity successfully shields planet - formation environments from companion - driven secular excitation of embedded orbits  @xcite .",
    "the observed enhanced binary rate for hot jupiter host stars suggests that planet formation is indeed unhindered in these systems .",
    "in this study we increase the sample size of our direct imaging survey from 50 transiting hot jupiter systems to 77 systems in order to take a closer look at the properties of the observed population of stellar companions and to place improved constraints on the possible effects of these companions on hot jupiter formation .",
    "we obtain a more precise measurement of hot jupiter stellar multiplicity and characterize the mass ratio as well as semi - major axis distributions of the observed population of companions as compared to those of solar - type field stars .",
    "finally , while our previous work shows that hot jupiter migration via kozai - lidov oscillations is unlikely , this work uses the larger sample size to place quantitative upper limits on this migration mechanism .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : obs ] describes our observations . in section  [ sec : analysis ] we characterize companion properties and determine our contrast limits .",
    "section  [ sec : companions ] describes each of the individual multistellar systems detected in our new observations .",
    "section  [ sec : surveyresults ] reports our survey results , companion rates , and trends in the properties of the observed population of stellar companions .",
    "section  [ sec : discuss ] discusses the implications of our results for hot jupiter planet formation and constrains the fraction of systems affected by kozai - lidov .",
    "section  [ sec : summary ] presents a summary of this work .",
    "our total sample consists of 82 systems known to host transiting gas giant planets .",
    "we divide our sample into two populations .",
    "the first population , containing 77 stars , is our `` survey sample '' , which is the only population we use in all of the estimates of hot jupiter companion fraction and other constraints presented in this work .",
    "the first 50 targets in this sample are the same set of stars used in the first three fohj papers . for more information on the selection of these targets ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "the remaining 27 targets are new systems with transiting gas giant planets with masses between 0.27@xmath10 and 4.06@xmath10 and separations between 0.014@xmath1 and 0.061@xmath1 .",
    "they were selected without regard to whether or not the stars had directly imaged stellar companions reported by other imaging surveys .",
    "we also relax our previous preference for systems with published spin - orbit alignment measurements , as our initial survey results found no evidence for any correlation between this parameter and the presence of a stellar companion .",
    "the second population is a set of five targets ( hat - p-54 , wasp-36 , wasp-58 , wasp-76 , wasp-103 ) that we decided to observe only after their stellar companions were reported in the published literature  @xcite .",
    "therefore , they do not form a part of our survey population and we exclude them from our statistical analysis discussed in section  [ sec : surveyresults ] .",
    "we characterize the companions around these non - survey targets following the same procedure as the survey targets , to be described in section  [ sec : analysis ] , and report on these systems individually in section  [ sec : companions ] .",
    "although these targets can not be fairly considered in our determination of the hot jupiter companion rate , we are still able to confirm the existence of the companions around non - survey targets from previous studies and provide new or updated companion properties .",
    "we obtained @xmath11 band ao observations using the nirc2 instrument ( instrument pi : keith matthews ) on keck ii between february 2012 and january 2016 .",
    "these new observations are summarized in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "we follow the same procedure described in @xcite .",
    "we operated in the natural guide star mode using the narrow camera setting , which yields a plate scale of 10@xmath12mas@xmath12pixel@xmath13 .",
    "each survey target had at least one series of @xmath11 band observations with at least 105 seconds of on - sky integration time .",
    "as in our previous survey , this strategy allows us to reach contrasts of @xmath14 of 8 magnitudes at @xmath15 of separation . for targets where a companion was detected",
    ", we also take observations in @xmath16 and/or @xmath17 bands in order to obtain a measurement of the companion s color .",
    "we also test for common proper motion using additional epochs of @xmath11 band imaging obtained 1 - 3 years after the initial detection .",
    "these followup photometric and astrometric observations may have shorter integration time .",
    "we use dome flats and dark frames to calibrate our images and to identify hot pixels and dead pixels using the criteria described in @xcite .",
    "we utilize these individual calibrated frames for our photometric and astrometric analysis , while we perform our sensitivity calculations on the median stack of these individual frames .",
    "we identify candidate companions around 15 of our target stars ( see figures  [ fig : comps_survey ] and [ fig : comps_nonsurvey ] ) . we summarize the stellar parameters for all observed stars in table  [ tab : stellar_params ] .",
    "we measure the flux ratio and on - sky separation for each detected multi - stellar system by fitting each image with a multiple - source point spread function ( psf ) modelled as a combination of a moffat and gaussian functions . for the functional form and description of the parameters , see  @xcite .",
    "we use a maximum likelihood estimation routine to find the best fit parameters and create an analytic form for our psf model using these parameters .",
    "integrating this psf model over a circular aperture for each star yields the flux ratio .",
    "the difference in the stellar position parameters determines the separation as projected onto the nirc2 array . to get the true on - sky separation and position angle between the stars , we use the known nirc2 astrometric corrections  @xcite to account for the nirc2 distortion and rotation .",
    "these astrometric corrections include uncertainties on the distortion , plate scale and orientation of the nirc2 array and we include all of these uncertainties in our reported errorbars for our measured separation and position angle .    for each individual calibrated frame , we compute the flux ratio and separations as outlined above .",
    "we then report the best estimate for each of these values as the mean value from all of the frames .",
    "we estimate our measurement error as the standard error on the mean .",
    "we report the best fitting flux ratio between primary and companion stars as a magnitude difference in each survey bandpass in table  [ tab : comp_phot ] .",
    "we also use apparent magnitudes of the primary star from the 2mass catalog  @xcite to compute the apparent magnitudes of the companion stars in all bands .",
    "tables  [ tab : phot_colors ] and  [ tab : comp_astr ] report all computed photometry and k - band astrometry , respectively , of our detected companion stars .",
    "we are interested in determining whether or not our detected companion stars are gravitationally bound to the primary star . for our candidate mutli - stellar systems , we followed up with k - band images to verify that the companion star shares common proper motion with the primary star . following the procedure described in  @xcite",
    ", we calculate the evolution of the companion s separation and position angle if it were a background object and compare it to the actual measured separation and position angle at each observation date in figures  [ fig : astr_plot1 ] and [ fig : astr_plot2 ] .",
    "when our candidate companions have been imaged in other surveys and these other surveys report a separation and position angle with uncertainties , we also include these previous measurements .",
    "table  [ tab : comp_astr ] lists all the astrometric measurements used in our analysis .      for each confirmed multi - stellar system , we compute the companion star s physical parameters using the method described in  @xcite . in brief , we model the primary and companion star fluxes by integrating the phoenix synthetic spectra  @xcite over the observed bandpass .",
    "we use the set of models corresponding to solar metallicities and composition ( [ fe / h]@xmath18 , [ @xmath19/h]@xmath18 ) . for the primary star ,",
    "we use previously published measurement of stellar mass , radius , effective temperature and distance as listed in table  [ tab : stellar_params ] . for the companion star ,",
    "we use the same distance measurement and calculate the companion star effective temperature that would result in a companion star flux that matches the observed flux ratio .",
    "we use the zero - age main sequence models from @xcite to determine the companion star s mass and radius from the effective temperature .",
    "our error budget includes all relevant measurement uncertainties but does not include any model dependent uncertainties from the phoenix spectra or the zero - age main sequence model .",
    "we calculate effective temperatures for each candidate companion based on the measured flux ratios in the @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath11 bands , and ask whether the brightness ratios across all three bands are consistent with the same stellar effective temperature .",
    "we report these individual effective temperatures values as well as the average across all three bands in table  [ tab : interp_sec ] .",
    "the projected spatial separations are computed using our measured projected on - sky separations and the stellar distance . because the majority of our stars do not have measured parallaxes , we use a spectroscopic distance estimated derived from the spectral type and the star s apparent magnitude .",
    "we calculate contrast curves for all targets imaged , regardless of whether or not a companion was detected .",
    "our algorithm is described in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : contrast ] shows the k - band @xmath20 contrast limit , in magnitudes , for all targets discussed in this paper .",
    "we are able to reach a @xmath20 contrast of @xmath21 for most of the targets surveyed .",
    "when considering our survey s sensitivity for each target we use its individual contrast curve as discussed in section  [ sec : incomplete ] , below .",
    "we find 17 candidate stellar companions around 15 of the systems observed , of which 3 are reported for the first time in this paper . in this section ,",
    "we discuss each system individually and categorize them according to whether or not the companion is bound or not as confirmed by common proper motion measurements . for targets where our astrometric measurements are inconclusive we consider whether or not the companion has colors consistent with the expected spectral type for a bound companion .",
    "our analysis confirms 6 companions as gravitationally bound , identifies 10 candidate companions with inconclusive astrometric measurements and colors consistent with those of a bound companion , and finds 1 candidate companion to be a background object . for each candidate companion , we report the differential magnitude @xmath14 , separation @xmath22 and position angle ( pa ) from our first detection epoch for comparison with detections from other studies .",
    "we also discuss any observations previously reported by other studies .",
    "we find a companion with @xmath23 and pa @xmath24 .",
    "@xcite also found a candidate stellar companion at the same separation , however they note that the companion was too dim for them to reliably measure its flux .",
    "our three astrometric measurements show that this companion is physically bound , an argument that is strengthened by the inclusion of the single epoch of astrometry by @xcite .",
    "@xcite also imaged this system but reported that this companion is below their survey sensitivity .",
    "we find a companion with @xmath25 and pa @xmath26 .",
    "due to our dithering pattern , this faint companion only appeared in a subset of our dithered images . as a result , we failed to identify it in our original 2012 images .",
    "after  @xcite pointed this out , we revisited our old observations and found that the companion was indeed present in a subset of the frames .",
    "inspection of the contrast curve for this system from @xcite confirms that the companion fell below our formal @xmath20 detection limit , and is therefore consistent with the non - detection reported in @xcite .",
    "we obtained new images of the system in 2015 , in which we planned our dither pattern to make sure that the companion remained in the frame in all images .",
    "although the @xcite astrometric uncertainties were too large to verify common proper motion , our measurements from 2012 and 2015 show the candidate is consistent with a bound stellar companion .",

    "we find a companion with @xmath41 and pa @xmath42 .",
    "our astrometric analysis is not well matched by models for either a bound companion or a background object . because the color of this candidate companion is consistent with a late - type main sequence star , we tentatively consider hat - p-5 to be a candidate multi - stellar system for the our companion fraction analysis .",

    "our companion color and effective temperature as well the previous studies color measurements indicate this companion is consistent with a late type main sequence star at the same distance as the primary star .",
    "so , we consider hat - p-41 to be a candidate multi - stellar system .",
    "we find a companion with @xmath50 and pa @xmath51 .",
    "because the central star has a spectral type of k7 , the measured flux ratio predicts a companion temperature below @xmath52 , the lower limit on the phoenix models .",

    "first , we report the companion fraction of the entire survey sample to be @xmath0 ( @xmath94 for the new targets presented in this work ) for companions with separations between 50@xmath1 and 2000@xmath1 . this overall companion fraction is consistent with our previously reported companion fraction of @xmath95 in @xcite .",
    "we next use the results of our long term radial velocity monitoring survey  @xcite to constrain the population of stellar companions within 50@xmath1 . following the procedure in section 3.5 of @xcite , we compute the sensitivity to stellar companions ( masses greater than 0.08@xmath70 ) for the 50 targets in our sample with long term radial velocity data .",
    "figure  [ fig : sens ] shows the resulting average sensitivity contours for ao imaging and radial velocity data sets as a function of companion semi - major axis . with the exception of one target , our radial velocity monitoring rules out stellar companions within 50@xmath1 .",
    "the only exception is the stellar companion to hat - p-10 , detected by both our radial velocity survey  @xcite and our ao survey  @xcite with a projected separation of 42@xmath1 . although the current data for this companion are also consistent with orbital semi - major axes beyond 50@xmath1 , we count it as interior to 50@xmath1 for the purposes of our statistical analysis .",
    "following the same completeness - correction procedure as for our ao companion fraction , we use the rv sensitivity curves of a sample of 51 transiting hot jupiters  @xcite and find that @xmath3 of these hot jupiters have stellar companions between 1@xmath1 and 50@xmath1 .",
    "we also compare our overall companion fraction for hot jupiter host stars with that of solar - type field stars . in @xcite , we were sensitive to stellar companions with periods as short as @xmath96 for some of our nearby targets , which corresponds to separations of 10@xmath1 . without a constraint on potential stellar companions within 50@xmath1 from radial velocity monitoring",
    ", we made the conservative choice to compare our ao detected companion fraction to the field star population with periods between @xmath96 and @xmath97 ( corresponding to separations between 10@xmath1 and 2000@xmath1 for solar - like stars ) .",
    "however , surveys of star - forming regions indicate that binaries with separations less than 50@xmath1 have significantly shorter disk lifetimes while binaries with larger separations appear to have disk lifetimes comparable to those of single stars  ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . in addition",
    ", @xcite surveyed 382 _ kepler _ planet host stars and found that there is a @xmath98 deficit in stars with binaries closer than 50@xmath1 compared to field stars , suggesting that these close binaries negatively influence planet formation  ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we therefore change our approach in this analysis to consider the multiplicity rate for companions interior and exterior to 50@xmath1 separately .",
    "we compute the field star companion fraction for companions with periods between @xmath99 and @xmath97 ( corresponding to separations between 50@xmath1 and 2000@xmath1 for solar - like stars ) to be @xmath100 .",
    "thus , we find that hot jupiters have 2.9 times as many companions in this phase space as field stars , where the difference is significant at the @xmath2 level .",
    "in contrast , there is a lack of stellar companions to transiting hot jupiter host stars with separations less than @xmath82 .",
    "on the other hand , only @xmath3 of hot jupiters have stellar companions with separations between 1@xmath1 and 50@xmath1 , while @xmath4 of field stars have stellar companions in this range , corresponding to a @xmath5 difference .",
    "we choose a lower limit of @xmath101 to avoid systems where the stellar companion could eject the hot jupiter  @xcite .",
    "we note that if we relax this lower limit and considered all companions with separations less than 50@xmath1 , we find that hot jupiter hosts have a companion fraction of @xmath102 while field stars have a companion fraction of @xmath103 , which is a difference of @xmath104 .",
    "these values are consistent with the results of @xcite .    in a recent study ,",
    "@xcite use a sample of 101 systems observed with lucky imaging to derive a completeness - corrected estimate of @xmath9 for the multiplicity rate of hot jupiter host stars .",
    "this number is in good agreement with our value , but @xcite differ from our study in their calculation of the equivalent field star multiplicity rate .",
    "although their imaging survey is only sensitive to companions beyond 200 au , they integrate over field star binaries with separations greater than 5 au , resulting in a field star multiplicity rate of @xmath105",
    ". however , we argued above , this conflates two regions with apparently distinct companion occurrence rates . if we instead take 200@xmath1 , or periods of @xmath106 , as our lower limit for field star binaries and re - calculate the corresponding field star multiplicity rate we find a value of @xmath107 , which is @xmath108 lower than the hot jupiter multiplicity rate reported by @xcite .",
    "we therefore conclude that their results are consistent with our finding that hot jupiters a higher multiplicity rate than field stars at wide separations . in order to facilitate comparisons between our study and those of @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we re - calculate our hot jupiter companion fraction for separations between 200@xmath1and 2000@xmath1 .",
    "we find a value of @xmath109 in this regime , in good agreement with both of these studies .",
    "this companion fraction is also @xmath104 higher than the field star companion fraction of @xmath110 for companions separated between @xmath111 and @xmath83 .",
    "next , we compare the observed distribution of companion mass ratios and semi - major axes with those of field stars .",
    "figure  [ fig : eta_mratio ] shows the survey s observed companion fraction , the survey s completeness corrected companion fraction @xmath112 , and the completeness corrected field star companion fraction  @xcite as a function of companion star mass ratio .",
    "we find that distribution of mass ratios for the stellar companions detected in our survey is concentrated towards small values , unlike the relatively uniform distribution observed for field stars .",
    "it is possible that our distribution is shaped at least in part by observational biases in ground - based transit surveys , where binary companions with separations less than 1@xmath35  are likely to be blended with the primary in the survey photometry , therefore diluting the observed transit depths in these systems .",
    "equal mass binaries with projected separations of less than 0@xmath35.5 are also challenging targets for radial velocity follow - up due to the blended nature of the stellar lines , and it is possible that these kinds of systems might receive a lower priority for follow - up as compared to apparently single stars or those with relatively faint companions .",
    "@xcite found three stellar companions to _ kepler _ short - period ( @xmath113 ) giant planet hosts with @xmath114 , corresponding to mass ratios greater than 0.8 .",
    "while this is consistent with the idea that ground - based transit surveys might be biased against detecting hot jupiters orbiting equal mass binaries , the current transiting sample are missing this population of hot jupiters , the current sample sizes are too small to apply a correction .    while the field star companion fraction rises up to mass ratios of 0.3 , our survey companion fraction is largest for mass ratios less than 0.2 . although @xcite corrected their field star sample to account for survey incompleteness at the lowest mass ratios , it is possible that their correction underestimated the true incompleteness at small mass ratios . because this trend is seen in the completeness corrected companion fraction but not the observed companion fraction , we considered whether it could be an artifact introduced by our completeness correction calculation .",
    "we generate simulated companions down to a mass of 0.08@xmath70 , which is a mass ratio of 0.05 for our most massive survey target and less than 0.1 for all but one of our survey targets ( for wasp-43 , this limit corresponds to a mass ratio of 0.13 ) .",
    "therefore , while the smallest mass ratio bin may have unequal sizes for each target , the second smallest bin is the same for all targets and also shows an enhanced companion fraction relative to that of field stars .",
    "although our correction is more uncertain at lower masses , the difference between our completeness corrected companion fraction and the field star distribution in the 0.1 - 0.2 mass ratio bin is greater than the uncertainty by @xmath7 .",
    "figure  [ fig : eta_logsepau ] shows the survey s observed companion fraction , the survey s completeness corrected companion fraction @xmath115 , and the completeness corrected field star companion fraction  @xcite as a function of companion star projected separation .",
    "the comparison is made in logarithmic space for projected separation as  @xcite found that the periods of companion stars follow a log - normal distribution .",
    "this plot shows a higher companion fraction in our survey than in the field star sample .",
    "however , we find that the relative distribution of companion separations in our sample is in good agreement with those of the field star sample .",
    "although our distribution appears to be effectively uniform , this is consistent with the log - normal distribution reported in  @xcite since our survey space spans a relatively small fraction of the separations considered in @xcite .",
    "we next investigate whether our measured companion fraction could be affected by differences in the metallicities of the stars in our sample as compared to the field star sample .",
    "@xcite found tentative evidence for a rise in the multiplicity rate for metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath116 ) stars and a uniform multiplicity rate for metallicities between -0.3 and + 0.4 .",
    "our targets have metallicities ranging from @xmath117 to @xmath118 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the increased companion fraction for our sample of hot jupiter hosts is unlikely to be due to the higher metallicities of our stars as compared to the field star sample .",
    "we also considered whether the presence of companions in our sample is correlated with the metallicities of the host stars , although we would not expect such a correlation based on the results from the field star sample .",
    "if we simply compare the host star metallicity distribution of single and multi - stellar systems , we find that they are consistent with each other .",
    "this is not surprising , as the typical metallicity uncertainties are between 0.1 dex and 0.2 dex , which is a significant fraction of the total metallicity range spanned by our sample .",
    "our survey results show that stellar companions are found in hot jupiter systems at a rate which is higher than the rate for field stars , that these companions tend to have low mass ratios , and that their distribution of projected separations is similar to that of field stars over the range of separations considered here ( 50@xmath1 to 2000@xmath1 ) . here , we discuss two potential ways in which companion stars might influence hot jupiter formation .",
    "we first consider whether these wide stellar companions could enhance the global gas giant planet formation rate , and then consider whether or not they might preferentially enable the inward migration of gas giant planets formed at larger separations .",
    "one possible explanation for the higher multiplicity rate of hot jupiter host stars is that these systems are more favorable sites for gas giant planet formation than single stars .",
    "for example , a stellar companion could raise spiral arms in a protoplanetary disk .",
    "these spiral arms are regions of high particle and gas density , which may be conducive to giant planet formation  ( e.g. dust traps as in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . indeed ,",
    "planetesimal formation through the streaming instability  @xcite as well as subsequent core growth through pebble accretion  @xcite exhibit a strong dependence on the local density of solids  @xcite .",
    "recent high contrast vlt / sphere imaging of the protoplanetary disk around hd 100453 , which has an m dwarf companion located at a distance of 120@xmath1 , revealed the presence of spiral structures  @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that these structures are best explained as perturbations from this companion rather than processes intrinsic to the disk .",
    "hd 141569 is part of a triple system and also hosts an asymmetric disk  ( for a summary of these features see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) with a structure that can plausibly be attributed to perturbations from these stellar companions  @xcite . the mass ratios and separations of these two systems are similar to those of the binaries in our study , suggesting that the presence of a stellar companion can facilitate planet formation in these systems .",
    "alternatively , protoplanetary disks around wide binaries might be more massive than those around single stars , and therefore would have more material available for giant planet formation .",
    "although current observations suggest that close ( @xmath119 separation ) binaries have shorter disk lifetimes , disks in wide binaries appear to have lifetimes comparable to those of isolated stars  @xcite .",
    "planet formation simulations predict that higher - mass disks will form higher - mass planets  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , @xcite suggest that the timing of fragmentation in protostellar disks could create an asymmetric mass distribution resulting in a low mass ratio companion with a relatively small disk as compared to that of the primary star .",
    "these scenarios assume that the companion stars formed at the same time as the primary star , rather than being captured .",
    "high contrast imaging and radial velocity surveys of planet - hosting stars in the _ kepler _ sample suggest that binary star systems are less likely to host small , close - in planets than their single counterparts  @xcite .",
    "although this might be interpreted as an argument against the massive disk scenario , it might conversely be argued that rocky cores embedded in a more massive disk are more likely to reach runaway accretion and turn into gas giants  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these gas giant planets could then become hot jupiters via type ii disk migration  ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or via interactions with the stellar companion as described below .",
    "additionally , cores that reside in close proximity to the host star may also undergo runaway accretion , leading to in - situ formation of hot jupiters  @xcite .",
    "we next consider a scenario in which gas giants form at the same rate around both single and binary stars , but the presence of a stellar companion causes these planets to migrate inward from their formation locations via three - body interactions such as kozai - lidov oscillations  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we compute representative minimum mass ratios as a function of companion separation required for the stellar companion to excite kozai - lidov oscillations on a @xmath120 mass planet . in single planet systems , this constraint is set by the planet pericenter precession timescale caused by general relativity .",
    "we therefore calculate the companion mass and separation such that the kozai - lidov oscillation timescale is equal to the pericenter precession timescale , following equations 1 and 23 in @xcite . for these representative limits ,",
    "we assume a primary star mass of @xmath121 , a companion star orbital eccentricity of 0.5 and a circular orbit for the planet .",
    "these expressions scale with the companion star s orbital eccentricity as @xmath122 and with the planet s orbital eccentricity as @xmath123 , so the effect of a non - zero planetary eccentricity is mild .",
    "we choose 0.5 as the representative stellar eccentricity as previous studies of stellar companions around fgk stars in our solar neighborhood show that stellar companions with periods longer than 12 days have eccentricities uniformly distributed between 0 and 1  @xcite .",
    "we compute three different representative limits for planets with starting semimajor axis distances of @xmath101 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 , and compare these limits to the masses and projected separations of our observed population of stellar companions in figure  [ fig : sep_v_mass ] .",
    "we next compute the completeness corrected fraction of hot jupiter systems with stellar companions that are capable of inducing kozai - lidov oscillations . unlike the calculation of representative cases above",
    ", we now use actual system parameters for each target , including the primary star mass and planet mass .",
    "unfortunately the orbital parameters of the companion star , such as eccentricity and inclination , are unknown because our baselines are not currently long enough to detect orbital motion in these systems . because the kozai - lidov timescale depends only weakly on the eccentricity of the companion for values less than 0.9 , we obtain equivalent results if we set the eccentricities of the companions to 0.5 in our distributions as compared to sampling from a uniform distribution .",
    "we assume that if a companion is present , its mutual inclination will be greater than the critical angle required to induce kozai - lidov oscillations .",
    "we do not account for suppression of the stellar kozai - lidov due to interactions with other planetary or brown dwarf companions , which are known to exist in a subset of these systems  @xcite .",
    "the resulting numbers therefore represent an upper limit on the fraction of hot jupiter systems that have experienced kozai - lidov in the most optimistic case .",
    "we compute these fractions for three different initial planetary semimajor axes , at 1@xmath1 , 2.5@xmath1 , and 5.0@xmath1 , and we find that the upper limits to be @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "we also average over all potential initial planetary semimajor axes between 1@xmath1 to 5@xmath1 by sampling from the @xcite power law distribution fit to the population of known rv - detected gas giant planets .",
    "we find that the upper limit on the fraction of hot jupiter systems that formed via kozai - lidov migration in this case is @xmath128 .",
    "we also consider a more realistic case in which we account for the fact that the presence of additional gas giant planetary companions would act to disrupt kozai - lidov oscillations  @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that @xmath129 of hot jupiter systems have long period rv - detected companions so we multiply our optimistic kozai - lidov upper limits by a factor of 0.49 and find that our realistic upper limit on the fraction of hot jupiter systems that formed via kozai - lidov migration is @xmath130 .",
    "although a critical mutual inclination , which depends on the planet s initial eccentricity , is required for this mechanism , we do not know the stellar companion inclination distribution for hot jupiter systems or the eccentricity distribution of proto - hot jupiters .",
    "if we assume an isotropic distribution of stellar companions , then our corresponding upper limit on the fraction of kozai - lidov systems will decrease by a factor of 0.37 , to @xmath131 .",
    "however , if kozai - lidov migration is a strong contributor to hot jupiter migration , then it is possible that the inclination distribution for hot jupiter companions are not isotropic . in addition ,",
    "@xcite show that planet - disc interactions in binary star systems can act to tilt the planet s orbit so that the angle between the planet and companion is greater than the critical angle .",
    "we therefore conclude that the inclusion of a geometric correction for companion inclination is not currently justified , leaving us with an estimate of @xmath132 for the fraction of hot jupiters that might have migrated via kozai - lidov oscillations induced by a stellar companion .",
    "these upper limits are consistent with a range of recent theoretical work constraining the frequency of kozai - lidov oscillations in hot jupiter systems",
    ". simulations of binary star planet hosting systems considering the eccentric kozai - lidov mechanism to octopole order find that the eccentric kozai - lidov mechanism can account for the formation of up to 30% of hot jupiter systems  @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimate the @xmath133 upper limit on the fraction of hot jupiters with periods greater than 3 days that could have migrated in via kozai - lidov interactions with a stellar companion to be 44% , based on the relatively long circularization timescales in these systems and the corresponding absence of a large population of high eccentricity gas giants at intermediate separations in the kepler sample .",
    "this calculation implicitly assumes that all systems have an outer planetary or stellar companion capable of inducing a high eccentricity in the proto - hot jupiter , but does not specifically require that this occur via kozai - lidov oscillations .",
    "@xcite performed simulations similar to @xcite with a more restrictive value for the tidal disruption distance , that is , the pericenter distance where an inwardly migrating planet would be tidally disrupted instead of forming a hot jupiter .",
    "when he considers the currently observed hot jupiter occurrence rate and semi - major axis distribution , he finds that at most 23% of observed hot jupiters could have been formed via kozai - lidov migration .",
    "we note that both @xcite and @xcite assumed that hot jupiter host stars have companions at the same rate as field stars , which means their limits are underestimated by a factor of two .",
    "however , they also assume that the proto - hot jupiter is the only planet in the system , resulting in a factor of two over - estimate which effectively cancels the under - estimate due to the enhanced binary rate in these systems . @xcite and @xcite performed an analytical calculation of the fraction of hot jupiters created via a kozai - lidov migration scenario and found values ranging from 12% to 15% , depending on initial planet masses from 0.3 to 3 jupiter masses and varying tidal dissipation strength .",
    "as demonstrated in figure  [ fig : sep_v_mass ] , the upper limit we derive here is primarily sensitive to our assumptions about the starting semi - major axes of the proto - hot jupiters . because the stellar companions detected in our survey",
    "typically have low masses and large projected separations , many of them require large initial semi - major axes for the planet in order to achieve the required inward migration .",
    "in addition , if hot jupiter survey selection biases exclude hot jupiters in equal mass binaries ( see section  [ sec : mratio ] ) , then our sample may not be representative of the entire population of hot jupiters",
    ". nevertheless , kozai - lidov oscillations can not be the dominant migration mechanism for transiting hot jupiter systems from ground - based surveys .",
    "it is worth noting that there are other ways in which a stellar companion might affect the dynamical evolution of planetary systems beyond the kozai - lidov migration scenario considered here .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite have proposed that the presence of a companion could change the orientation of the protoplanetary disk relative to the star s spin axis .",
    "it is our hope that the observations described here will serve to motivate new studies of the effects of the observed population of stellar companions on the dynamical evolution of these systems .",
    "we expect that future observations , e.g. by _ gaia _ , may also provide additional constraints on the orbital properties of these stellar companions , at least in the subset of systems for which it is possible to detect astrometric motion of the secondary on several year timescales .",
    "we conducted a direct imaging search for stellar companions around 77 transiting gas giant planet hosts and combine our results with a radial velocity stellar companion surveys to determine the occurrence of stellar companions around hot jupiter hosts .",
    "we detected a total of 27 candidate stellar companions , including three companions reported for the first time in this study .",
    "we also followed up on five systems with known candidate companions identified in published surveys .",
    "for all detected companions , we measure their flux ratios and positions to characterize the companion properties and evaluate the likelihood that they are physically bound to their host stars .",
    "we also provide updated photometric and astrometric measurements for all systems , including previously published candidate companions . we confirm common proper motion for six new multi - stellar systems while the other nine examined in this study remain candidate multi - stellar systems .",
    "overall , we find that hot jupiters have a stellar companion rate of @xmath0 for companions between 50@xmath1 and 2000@xmath1 .",
    "this is @xmath2 larger than the equivalent companion rate for field stars , which is @xmath100 . for companions between 1@xmath1 and 50@xmath1",
    "we find that only @xmath3 of hot jupiter systems host stellar companions while field stars have a companion rate of @xmath4 , corresponding to a difference of @xmath5 .",
    "we suggest that there may be a connection between the presence of a companion star beyond 50@xmath1 and processes that either favor giant planet formation or facilitate the inward migration of planets in these systems .",
    "we examine the companion fraction as a function of companion mass and companion separation and compare these distributions to those of field star binaries .",
    "we find that the mass ratio distribution for binaries hosting hot jupiters peaks at small mass ratios , unlike the relatively uniform distribution of mass ratios observed for field star binaries .",
    "although this may in part reflect a bias against equal mass binaries in photometric transit surveys , it is also plausible that higher mass companions might actively suppress planet formation by disrupting the protoplanetary disk . as discussed in section",
    "[ sec : moregiants ] , the more subtle effects of a low - mass companion on the disk structure could instead aid in planet formation by creating regions of locally enhanced density . alternatively ,",
    "protoplanetary disk masses in binary star systems may be higher than those of their isolated counterparts , resulting in globally enhanced disk densities .",
    "we also find that the companion fraction does not depend strongly on companion separation for semi - major axes greater than 50@xmath1 .",
    "we additionally use our sample of resolved stellar binaries to calculate an upper limit on the fraction of hot jupiter systems that might have migrated inward via kozai - lidov oscillations .",
    "we evaluate this number as a function of the planet s initial semi - major axis and find that the upper limits are @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and @xmath0 , for initial semi - major axes of 1@xmath1 , 2.5@xmath1 , and 5@xmath1 , respectively . when averaged over 1 - 5@xmath1 using the best - fit power law distribution for rv - detected planets and accounting for the presence of radial velocity companions in a subset of the systems observed ,",
    "this upper limit is @xmath132 .",
    "these observational constraints are in good agreement with published theoretical models and simulations of hot jupiter formation via the kozai - lidov mechanism , which also suggest that kozai - lidov driven migration can only account for a small fraction of the known hot jupiter systems .    this work was supported by nasa grant nnx14ad24 g .",
