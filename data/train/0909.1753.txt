    "jain and singh [ 1 ] report a study of electron - pair production following 160 a@xmath0gev @xmath1pb bombardment of nuclear emulsions , in which the energy and opening angles of pairs produced at distances greater than 50 @xmath2 from identified interaction vertices were analysed to determine the invariant masses of presumed neutral particles _ x _ decaying by the @xmath3 channel . derived neutral particle masses from 2 to 84 mev / c@xmath4 were reported , with lifetimes ranging from @xmath5 to @xmath6 s ( fig .",
    "1b , 2a , 3 and 4 of [ 1 ] ) .",
    "such large derived masses do not appear to be consistent with the total pair energy and opening angle data that are reported ( fig .",
    "1f of [ 1 ] ) .",
    "a re - analysis of the data presented in fig .",
    "1f indicates presumed neutral particle _ x _ invariant masses of 1.5 to 21 mev / c@xmath4 , with lifetimes between @xmath7 and @xmath8 s. this mass and lifetime range are consistent with previous indications of light neutral particles decaying to @xmath9 from cosmic ray [ 2 - 3 ] , emulsion bombardment [ 4 - 9 ] and nuclear decay [ 10 - 16 ] data .",
    "figure 1f of [ 1 ] shows a scatter plot of total electron - pair energy @xmath10 versus opening angle @xmath11 .",
    "a total of 62 of the reported 1220 @xmath9 pairs fall above borsellino s [ 17 ] most probable opening angle @xmath12 at an invariant mass 1.02 mev / c@xmath4 as plotted together with the data in fig .",
    "1f of [ 1 ] .",
    "these 62 events are , therefore , the only events that can be interpreted as indicating the decays of massive particles into @xmath9 pairs . the total energies and opening angles of these 62 events are reproduced in fig .  [",
    "fig : rawdata ] , together with plots of borsellino s most probable opening angle @xmath12 and 1.5 times borsellino s angle .",
    "the invariant mass @xmath13 for a presumed neutral particle _ x _ decaying to @xmath9 pairs was computed as :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the electron rest mass and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the pair electron energies , here taken to be equal on the basis of the very small energy divergences reported in fig .",
    "1e of [ 1 ] .",
    "the computed invariant masses are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : massdata ] .",
    "the _ x_-particle lifetimes reported in [ 1 ] could not be confirmed directly , as the measured interaction vertex to pair vertex distances are not given and figs 1b and 1f of [ 1 ] can not be compared on a point - for point basis .",
    "the highest density of events is reported [ 1 ] to be between 50 and 300 @xmath18 m of an interaction vertex , and this distance range was used to calculate _ x_-particle lifetimes of @xmath5 to @xmath6 s [ 1 ] . from the mass range shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : massdata ] , the _ x_-particle lifetime @xmath19 can be estimated to be between @xmath20 for a 1 mev / c@xmath4 _ x_-particle travelling 50 @xmath18 m and @xmath8 for a 10 mev / c@xmath4 _ x_-particle travelling 300 @xmath18 m , i.e. the revised mass calculations yield a median lifetime of approximately @xmath5 s , an order of magnitude lower than reported in [ 1 ] .",
    "evidence for neutral particles with masses less than 10 mev decaying into @xmath9 pairs has previously been reported from cosmic ray [ 2,3 ] , emulsion bombardment [ 4 - 9 ] and nuclear decay [ 10 - 16 ] data .",
    "the structure of these particles is unknown .",
    "however , the angular distributions of @xmath9 pairs emitted in a 10.96 mev 0@xmath21 @xmath22 0@xmath23 magnetic monopole ( m0 ) transition in @xmath24o forbidden to both single-@xmath25 and internal pair - conversion ( ipc ) modes indicates that an _ x_-boson of approximately 10 mev / c@xmath4 is the primary decay product in this transition [ 13 - 14 ] .",
    "similarly , the analysis reported in [ 4,5 ] suggests that 1.1 , 2.1 and 9 mev / c@xmath4 bosons are primary products of @xmath26c and @xmath27ne bombardments of nuclear emulsions .",
    "these candidate light neutral bosons have been tentatively interpreted as potential components of light dark matter [ 18 ] .",
    "the present re - analysis of the 160 a@xmath0gev @xmath1pb emulsion data reported by jain and singh [ 1 ] brings the majority of events observed in these reactions into a mass and lifetime range consistent with earlier reports of light neutral bosons decaying into @xmath9 pairs .",
    "a comprehensive re - analysis of data from multiple sources indicating the existence of such particles is currently under way [ 19 ] .",
