    "by the time a cluster of galaxies reaches a relatively relaxed state , the hot gas in the centre is likely to have a radiative cooling time which is shorter than the expected cluster age and a temperature which drops toward the centre , due to energy losses from x - ray emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this effect , termed a `` cooling flow '' , provides a mechanism by which matter can condense out of the hot intracluster medium ( icm ) and is observationally detected as an enhanced x - ray surface brightness peak in the cores of clusters .",
    "the final state of this cooling gas is still a matter of intense debate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as the temperatures of the cooling gas are found to generally drop by less than a factor of @xmath534 with very little cooler gas ( presumably due to some form of heating , such as from an active galactic nucleus ) . despite this cooling `` floor '' , and the fact that the mass of gas cooling to zero represents only a tiny fraction of the overall hot phase of the icm , cooling cores remain an observational phenomenon which inexplicably trace the physical processes by which clusters of galaxies form . in general",
    ", the central regions of a cluster of galaxies must remain relatively relaxed both to establish and maintain a cooling core .",
    "strong disturbances to the cluster , such as might be caused by merging for example , should mix the cluster gas and could disrupt the cooling core . the extent to which the cooling core can be suppressed or destroyed , in fact ,",
    "depends on a number of factors such as the initial strength of the cooling core , how off - centre the merger is , and the mass ratio of merging systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "thus , a proper census of cooling cores in clusters as a function of lookback time should provide important constraints on the robustness of cooling cores , the nature of cluster buildup and allow further refinements to structure formation models .",

    "x - ray spectral analysis in both cases was always performed only on the first entry in table  [ tab : obs ] ( typically the longest observation ) and data were masked out beyond intrinsic radii of 0.5  mpc to simplify and speed up analyses .    in the first method",
    ", we divided the data into several regions using a `` contour binning '' method such that the signal - to - noise was 2040 per region depending on the quality of the data .",
    "the algorithm defines regions with a signal - to - noise greater than a threshold by growing bins in the direction on a smoothed map which has a value closest to the mean value of those pixels already binned .",
    "this technique defines bins which are matched to the surface brightness distribution of the object .",

    "the results of this spectral analysis were combined together to form the projected temperature maps shown in figure  [ fig : images ] .",
    "the projected temperature maps complement the colour images in terms of identifying clusters with strong cool cores , but are particularly useful for revealing weak cool cores and further substructure not readily apparent from the images alone .    in the second method , we split the data into no more than 10 concentric circular annuli again such that the signal - to - noise was at least 20 per region , but often much higher depending on the quality of the data .",

    "x - ray spectra were extracted for each region and these regions were fit simultaneously in xspec with a projct model , adopting absorbed ( phabs ) single - temperature mekal models for each annular bin ( i.e. , a model identical to that used in the first method ) .",
    "using these annular spectral fits , we derived deprojected radial temperature , density , cooling time , and mass deposition rate profiles .",
    "as found in sections  [ sec : prep ] and [ sec : power ] , the majority of the clusters have relatively regular morphologies and generally appear to be relaxed . from a visual inspection of the 38 bcs clusters , we find five that are obviously double - peaked and four more that have disturbed morphologies indicative of merging ( see table  [ tab : props1 ] .",
    "the temperature maps in a handful of clusters hint at mild additional substructure within 0.5  mpc .",
    "we note that our assumption of spherical symmetry does little to account for clusters with double - peaked or merging morphologies , which appear to make up @xmath17 per cent of the sample . in these cases ,",
    "our radial profiles simply serve as a proxy and are likely to overestimate the real temperature and underestimate the real central cooling time .",
    "thus we caveat that cooling times for disturbed clusters should be regarded as likely lower limits .",
    "we still provide this analysis since it may be useful to have some point of reference for comparison to lower - resolution nearby clusters observed with , e.g. , _ rosat _ or high - redshift clusters observed with _",

    "width=340 ]      we have measured the cooling time profiles for all of the clusters in our sample , as shown in figure  [ fig : cooling_profiles ] .",
    "while the cooling times in the central bin differ by a few orders in magnitude , we note that there appears to be a prominent , apparently universal lower bound to all of the cooling profiles .",
    "the average cooling time profile for the 13 clusters with a central cooling time less than 2  gyr ( thick black line ) indicates that there is little difference in the lower bounds for a set of clusters with widely ranging physical characteristics ( i.e. , temperatures , densities , entropies ) .",
    "while we might expect some sort of boundary given the general nature of how gas cools in clusters , it is physically unclear why a universal boundary that takes the form @xmath18 ( depending on whether one imposes an inner cutoff ) would exist .",
    "similarly , @xcite find a very small dispersion in cooling time profiles among their sample of 16 clusters with strong cool cores , with @xmath19 .",
    "line emission , respectively @xcite .",
    "circles denote morphologically regular clusters , while triangles denote double - peaked or disturbed clusters .",
    "there is a strong correspondence between low cooling time and detection of h@xmath4 line emission .",
    "the one exception is a2294 .",
    "[ fig : central_cooling_time],width=340 ]    the cooling times for the innermost radial bin are shown in figure  [ fig : central_cooling_time ] for each cluster . unfortunately in physical units ,",
    "the innermost radial bin is both a function of the cluster distance and the overall signal - to - noise of the observation ( which in turn depends on whether a cluster exhibits a cool core ) ; hence the apparent correlation in figure  [ fig : central_cooling_time ] .",
    "importantly , the spatial resolution of _ chandra _ is a factor of several smaller than the typical innermost radius adopted ( i.e. , 05 corresponds to 13  kpc ) , so any failure to detect a significant cool core in the bcs sample is not due to any limitation on spatial resolution .",
    "also note that because we use the cluster centroid rather than the surface brightness peak , the cooling times inside a few tens of kpc could be biased upward by at most a factor of @xmath523 . ) and cluster temperatures never differ by more than a factor of 2 each . since @xmath20 , this means that @xmath21 is unlikely to change dramatically based on our adopted position .",
    "significant differences between the peak and centroid positions only occur in highly disturbed or double - peaked clusters and comprise at worst @xmath22 per cent of our sample ( see table  [ tab : props1 ] ) .",
    "] alternatively , the central cooling times should be considered upper limits because the strength of cooling depends strongly on the radius at which it is measured , and thus on the signal - to - noise of the observation .    from our determination of cooling times for the innermost radial bin",
    ", we find that at least 20 of 38 ( 53 per cent ) bcs clusters in the _ chandra _ sample have central cooling times @xmath23  gyr ( mild cool cores ) and at least 13 of 38 ( 34 per cent ) have @xmath24  gyr ( strong cool cores ) .",
    "to test for any evolution , we compare the cumulative cooling time fractions from the bcs sample to those found for the nearby b55 sample of @xcite , who provide cooling times for both the innermost radial bin and 180  kpc ( originally 250  kpc in their cosmology ) . at first glance , the fraction of cool core clusters in our sample as measured from the innermost radial bin would appear to be markedly different from those in the b55 sample ( see left plot in figure  [ fig : cooling_time_comp ] ) , implying substantial evolution in the cores of x - ray bright clusters out to @xmath25 .",
    "however , we must exercise caution here , since a direct comparison between the two samples in this manner is problematic .",
    "importantly , the innermost radial bins span a large range in both samples and are significantly smaller in the b55 ; thus comparing these quantities is not likely to provide a useful yardstick for cooling .",
    "additionally , we note that @xcite measured their cooling times using the surface brightness peak rather than the centroid , so there may be a slight systematic difference between the calculated cooling times for a small fraction of clusters .",
    "a final consideration is that the _ rosat _ observations of the fainter or more distant clusters in the b55 sample may fail to adequately resolve potential cool cores due to limited spatial resolution .    given the above problems , we instead choose to compare cooling times for the two samples at a fixed intrinsic radius where cooling is still important .",
    "since a large fraction of both samples have innermost radial bins close to or smaller than 50  kpc , this value seems like a sensible radius to use . at 50  kpc",
    ", we find that at least 21 of 38 ( 55 per cent ) bcs clusters in the _ chandra _ sample have central cooling times @xmath23  gyr ( mild cool cores ) and at least 8 of 38 ( 21 per cent ) have @xmath24  gyr ( strong cool cores ) . because the b55 sample lacks published cooling time profiles , we must interpolate cooling times at 50  kpc . for this purpose , we adopt as an interpolation template the average cooling profile found in figure  [ fig : cooling_profiles ] for clusters with @xmath26  gyr . comparisons at 50  kpc ( middle ) , as well as at 180  kpc ( right ) , are shown in figure  [ fig : cooling_time_comp ] .",
    "the apparent differences in the cooling time fractions measured using the innermost radial bin have now all but vanished , demonstrating that there is no detectable evolution in the cool core fraction of clusters out to @xmath25 .",
    "note that the small discrepancies for short cooling times may be due to our assumed interpolation template .",
    "also note that the fraction of cool cores in either sample has no obvious x - ray luminosity dependence .",
    "-0.2 in -0.2 in    let us consider the evolution of a cluster core hosting a cooling flow .",
    "first assume that it is isolated with no heating , so that radiative cooling proceeds to drop the gas temperature .",
    "approximating the situation locally as a constant pressure flow , then the cooling time at 50  kpc will decrease by approximately the mean time difference between the samples .",
    "the mean redshift of the b55 sample is 0.056 and of the 38 bcs clusters is 0.22 , so this difference in our adopted cosmology is about 1.8  gyr .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : cooling_time_comp ] that this is not occurring since at the 50 per cent level the curves are consistent with each other .",
    "second , we consider the effect of the continual accretion of subclusters by a cluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so that the cool central region undergo adiabatic compression which , for bremsstrahlung cooling appropriate here , varies as @xmath27 .",
    "this again reduces as time proceeds .",
    "weak to moderate shocks also reduce the cooling time .",
    "what is needed is a non - gravitational heat source which offsets the effects of radiative cooling .",
    "the similarity between the cumulative curves at 50  kpc for the b55 and bcs samples demonstrates that the heating invoked to balance radiative cooling required to explain the detailed temperature profiles of the clusters must have been in place before the redshift of the bcs .",
    "more distant samples are required to determine just when the heating / cooling balance was established .      as noted in @xmath8  [ sec : intro ] , the central temperatures in clusters are found to generally drop by less than a factor of @xmath534 with very little cooler gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this cooling `` floor '' is thought to be due to some form of heating ( e.g. , from an active galactic nucleus , conduction ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : cool_floor ] compares the temperature drop  taken to be ratio between the central bin temperature and the average temperature outside of 180  kpc  to both the 0.5  mpc power ratios and central cooling times ( _ right _ ) for the 38 bcs clusters in the sample .",
    "a similar cooling floor ( i.e. , a temperature drop of no more than @xmath284 ) exists for our cluster sample , and does not appear to correlate with either the strength of the cool core or its general morphology .",
    "interestingly , three of the four lowest temperature drop clusters are merging clusters ; inspection of the temperature maps for these clusters indicates that their large temperature ratios are in part likely due to shocks in the outer regions of those clusters . in general",
    ", we find that the disturbed clusters in our sample , which all have high @xmath29 values , span the entire range of observed temperature ratios , presumably due to the varied merger histories and ages of these clusters .          a significant fraction of clusters with cool cores have also been shown to exhibit signs of filamentary h@xmath4 line emission .",
    "since nearly all of the clusters in our sample have h@xmath4 observations @xcite , we can examine how useful h@xmath4 emission is as an indicator of cool cores and cluster morphological properties .",
    "figure  [ fig : central_cooling_time ] demonstrates that 13 of the 38 clusters in the sample show evidence for h@xmath4 line emission and all but one of these are among the clusters with the very shortest central cooling times .",
    "this result strengthens the correlation found by @xcite for relatively nearby clusters .",
    "interestingly , there are another three clusters among the 18 not observed by _",
    "chandra _ that also show evidence for h@xmath4 line emission .",
    "if the h@xmath4-detected fraction traces the overall cluster population , this would suggest that @xmath51520 per cent of the unobserved sources are likely to have strong cool cores and that we might expect a similar overall cool core distribution ( i.e. , both strong and moderate ) among the unobserved clusters as found for the sample sources .",
    "the observed h@xmath4 and star formation rates requires the mass of h@xmath4-emitting gas typically to be only a few to a few tens of @xmath30  yr@xmath10 , whereas classical cooling flows in the observed clusters would require many hundreds of @xmath30  yr@xmath10 .",
    "thus the presence of h@xmath4 could imply continuous cooling below the `` floor '' at a rate of up to a few tens of @xmath30  yr@xmath10 . or",
    "alternatively , it could imply the presence of conditions necessary for long - lived h@xmath4 .",
    "a large number of higher redshift clusters have now been found .",
    "as these sources are less likely to have the signal - to - noise or spatial resolution to unequivocally detect any potential cool cores , it is instructive to compare our cool core estimates and h@xmath4 detections for the bcs clusters with their power ratios ( which can be measured more reliably under the above conditions ) .",
    "indeed , figure  [ fig : power2 ] demonstrates that the power ratios provide a quantitive assessment of basic morphological trends and can be used as a proxy for central cooling times .",
    "figure  [ fig : tc_p3p0 ] bears out this relationship better , showing the strongest correlation between @xmath29 versus @xmath31 . as expected ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the more symmetric , compact clusters generally have stronger cool cores and a higher likelihood of h@xmath4 line detections .",

    "filled black , empty , and filled grey symbols denote clusters with detected , undetected , and unobserved h@xmath4 line emission , respectively @xcite .",
    "circles denote morphologically regular clusters , while triangles denote double - peaked or disturbed clusters .",
    "[ fig : tc_p3p0],width=302 ]",
    "using a sample of 38 luminous bcs clusters at @xmath320.4 , we find that cool cores still appear to be common at moderate redshift . at 50  kpc ,",
    "at least 55 per cent of the clusters in our sample possess mild cool cores ( @xmath1  gyr ) and within the central bin at least 34 per cent possess strong cool cores ( @xmath33  gyr ) .",
    "we find that a cooling floor exists for our moderate redshift sample , similar to that found for many nearby clusters , such that the ratio of central to outer temperatures rarely increases above a factor of @xmath34  34 .",
    "moreover , comparing the central cooling times to catalogues of central h@xmath4 emission in bcs clusters , we find a strong correspondence between the detection of h@xmath4 and short central cooling times .",
    "we also find a correlation between the central cooling time and cluster power ratios , indicating that crude morphological measures are a proxy for more rigorous analysis in the face of limited signal - to - noise data .",
    "comparing our moderate redshift bcs sample to the local b55 sample ( @xmath35 ) , we find no evidence for any significant evolution in the cumulative cooling time fractions at both 50  kpc and 180  kpc .",
    "this suggests that cool cores are already well - developed even at moderate redshifts and , as a consequence , are quite likely to be robust against a wide variety of merger scenarios .",
    "it also implies that any additional cooling our sample of clusters underwent over the last @xmath523 gyr must be balanced by some form of heating .",
    "thus , balanced heating and cooling mechanisms are likely to have already stabilised or been frozen in by this epoch .",
    "looking toward the future , it will be instructive to analyse _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _",
    "observations for a sample of local clusters ( such as the b55 sample ) in a manner similar to that done here for the bcs sample , so we can perform a more complete and rigorous comparison of the two samples .",
    "further work is also needed to understand when the onset of cool cores occurs .",
    "the high fraction of cooling core clusters observed here needs to be tied to the relative dearth of such clusters at the highest redshifts ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "another issue is to determine when and how the heating process , which leads to the nearly ubiquitous temperature plateau of a factor of 34 , occurs .",
    "this heating process appears to already be in place for the clusters in our sample , so again we must look to higher redshift samples for clues .",
