    "the computation of high order correlation functions of scalar fields in a de sitter spacetime can be of interest for investigations of the physics of the early universe .",
    "there are indeed a growing number of indications that in its early phase the universe underwent an inflationary period  @xcite that can be accurately described by a de sitter phase during which the energy density of the universe is thought to be dominated by the self energy of a scalar field  @xcite .",
    "its fluctuations , or the fluctuations of any other light scalar fields , are thought to be the progenitors of the large - scale structure of the universe  @xcite .",
    "the statistical properties of the induced metric fluctuations then depend on the potential landscape in which the fields evolve .",
    "it is unlikely that the fluctuations produced along the inflaton direction can be significantly non - gaussian as stressed in recent works  @xcite .",
    "it is possible however that if there exist other self interacting light scalar fields during that period primordial non gaussian metric fluctuations can be generated  @xcite .",
    "the details of the effects induced by such self - interacting fields is based on the statistical properties of the metric fluctuations that quantum generated field fluctuations can induced .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the foundation of these calculations by calculating the correlation properties of a test scalar field in a de sitter background .",
    "the content of the paper is the following .",
    "in the second part we present the basis of such computations . in the third we explore the expression of the leading order term of high order correlators for different self - interacting potentials .",
    "in particular we give explicit results for the superhorizon limit that corresponds to modes that can be observed today . finally we give insights on the physical interpretations of those results .",
    "for the purpose of our calculations we assume that the inflationary phase can be described by a de sitter background epoch .",
    "this description is only approximate since during the inflationary period the hubble constant slowly varies with time but it is a framework in which all calculations can be pursued analytically .",
    "we have checked that to a large extent the results would not be affected if the background is changed  , we recover the same behaviors in the superhorizon limit if @xmath0 is large enough . ] .",
    "a de sitter spacetime  @xcite in flat spatial section slicing is described by the metric , @xmath1 which is conformal to half of the minkowski spacetime .",
    "the conformal time is related to the cosmological time by @xmath2 and runs from @xmath3 to 0 , the limit @xmath4 representing the `` infinite future '' .    for a minimally coupled free quantum field of mass @xmath5",
    ", the solution can be decomposed in plane waves as @xmath6\\ ] ] where we have introduced @xmath7 , a hat referring to a quantum operator . in this heisenberg picture , the field has become a time - dependent operator expanded in terms of time - independent creation and annihilation operators satisfying the usual commutation relations @xmath8=\\delta_{\\rm",
    "dirac}({{\\bf k}}-{{\\bf k}}')$ ] .",
    "we can then define the free vacuum state by the requirement @xmath9 as it is standard while working in curved spacetime  @xcite , the definition of the vacuum state suffers from some arbitrariness since it depends on the choice of the set of modes @xmath10 .",
    "they satisfy the evolution equation @xmath11 the general solution of which is given by @xmath12 $ ] with @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the hankel functions of first and second kind and with @xmath16 . among this family of solutions ,",
    "it is natural to choose the one enjoying the de sitter symmetry and the same short distance behavior than in minkowski spacetime .",
    "this leads to @xmath17 this uniquely defines a de sitter invariant vacuum state referred to as the bunch - davies state vacuum  @xcite . in the massless limit",
    ", the solution ( [ eq : v ] ) reduces to @xmath18 this result gives the expression of the equal - time two - point correlator of the fourier modes , @xmath19    a remarkable result is that in the superhorizon limit ( @xmath20 ) is that the phase of @xmath21 freezes and it reads , @xmath22 note that the fourier modes of @xmath23 are frozen only in the case of a massless field in a de sitter background . as a result",
    "the field @xmath23 behaves like a classic stochastic field with fluctuations whose 2-point correlator is , @xmath24 and since @xmath23 is a free field , its superhorizon fluctuations follow a gaussian statistics .",
    "having determined the free field solutions , one can then express perturbatively the @xmath25-point correlation functions of the interacting field , @xmath23 , in terms of those of the free scalar field .",
    "the equal time correlators we are interested in are expectation values of product of field operators for the current time vacuum state .",
    "such computations can be performed following general principles of quantum field calculations  @xcite . the simplest formulation it is to apply the evolution operator @xmath26 backward in time to transform the interacting field vacuum into the free field vacuum at an arbitrarily early time @xmath27 so that , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is here the _ free field _",
    "it is implicitly assumed in this expression that the coupling of the field @xmath23 is switched on at time @xmath27 .",
    "we will see in the following that the choice of @xmath27 is not important as long as it is much earlier than any other times intervening in the problem .",
    "the evolution operator @xmath30 can be written in terms of the interaction hamiltonian , @xmath31 , as @xmath32    if one is interested only in a single vertex interaction quantity , the evolution operator can be expanded to linear order in @xmath31 , @xmath33 so that the connected part of the above ensemble average at a time @xmath34 finally reads , @xmath35\\vert 0{\\rangle}\\ ] ] where the brackets stand for the commutator .    the result is expressed in terms of the green function @xmath36\\ ] ] defined as @xmath37 .    before we proceed to explore explicit cases ,",
    "let us note that as long as calculations are restricted to tree order , the very same calculation can be done assuming that @xmath23 is a classic stochastic field whose stochastic properties are initially those of the quantum free field .",
    "not surprisingly one finds the same formal expressions !",
    "results can be given in a closed form for simple self - interacting potentials .",
    "we give in this section explicit results for cubic and quartic potentials . because of its renormalization properties , quartic potential is a natural choice to consider .",
    "we will however see that the case of a cubic potential can be relevant when finite volume effects are taken into account ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details on finite volume effects ) .    in the following we thus assume that @xmath31 is of the form @xmath38 and we are then interested in the computation of the leading order part of the connected part of the ensemble average of products of @xmath39 fourier modes of the fields .",

    "[ zetatot ] .",
    "it is found to be relatively weak .",
    "we did not fully explore its properties but one can explicitly show for instance that if one of the wave vectors vanishes , @xmath54 is smaller than @xmath56 and reaches its minimum , @xmath57 , for a symmetric configuration of the three remaining wave vectors . from the plot on fig .",
    "[ zetatot ] it appears that the minimum value of @xmath54 is @xmath58 and is reached for a  square \" configuration , that is when the four wavelengths are of equal length .",
    "the maximum value , @xmath56 , is reached when two of the wavelengths vanish .",
    "the overall variations of @xmath54 with the wavelength ratios are therefore rather mild .",
    "it is then legitimate to describe the four - point correlation function as the sum of products of two - point power spectra , e.g. , @xmath59 the vertex value , @xmath60 is given by @xmath61\\ ] ] that carries a weak geometrical dependence with the wave vectors geometry through @xmath54 .",
    "when the term @xmath62 is large ( and negative ) , that is when the number of @xmath63-folds , @xmath64 , between the time of horizon crossing for the modes we are interested in and the end of inflation is large , the vertex value is simply given @xmath65 which corresponds exactly to the value that was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite from the classical evolution of the stochastic field on superhorizon scales ( see comments in last section ) .",
    "the result obtained above is however more complete since it contains next to leading order terms .",
    "it allows , for instance , to estimate the validity regime of the superhorizon result .",
    "it shows in particular that the mode coupling induced on subhorizon scales are negligible as soon as the number of @xmath63-folds after horizon crossing exceeds a few units .",

    "we have obtained some closed forms for the 3- and 4-point correlation functions of a test scalar field with a self - interacting potential of order respectively 3 and 4 in a de sitter background .",
    "it is interesting to note , as it was already in the literature  @xcite , that the superhorizon behaviour of the field can be obtained from a simplified klein - gordon equation for the field evolution on superhorizon scales @xmath80 solved perurbatively at first order in @xmath81 . in this equation",
    "@xmath23 has to be understood as the filtered value of @xmath23 at a fixed scale that leaves the horizon at a given time @xmath82 .",
    "the previous equation is then valid for @xmath83 only where the field can be described by a classical stochastic field .",
    "moreover in writing this equation one also makes the assumption that its r.h.s .",
    "can be computed from the filtered value of the field ( which is not necessarily identical to what would have been obtained from a filtering of the source term ) .",
    "the equation ( [ chievol ] ) can be solved perturbatively in @xmath81 . at zeroth order @xmath23",
    "is constant and , at first order , it reads @xmath84 if @xmath85 is the leading order value of the field at horizon crossing .",
    "note that @xmath86 can be rewritten as @xmath87 where @xmath64 is the number of @xmath63-folds since horizon crossing .",
    "it implies that if the number of @xmath63-folds is large enough the term @xmath85 should become negligible . as a consequence the leading order expression of the first nontrivial high order cumulant of the one - point pdf of @xmath23 takes either the form @xmath88 or @xmath89 for respectively a cubic or a quartic potential .",
    "the value of the coefficient @xmath60 that enters these expressions is precisely the one obtained in eq .",
    "( [ vertexvalue ] ) in the superhorizon limit , that is @xmath90 . and",
    "indeed if one had to compute such cumulants from either expression ( [ p4sh ] ) or ( [ p3sh ] ) the integration over the wave vectors would have led to the very same expressions in the superhorizon limit .",
    "that shows that the late time behavior of the cumulants we found comes in fact from a simpler dynamical evolution .",
    "it actually demonstrates that the computations in the classical approach sketched here can be put on a firm ground .",
    "it also allows investigations of more subtle effects , such as the finite volume effects where more than one filtering scales have to be taken into account , that can not be properly addressed in a classical approach .    regarding finite volume effect it is interesting to investigate how the results for the cubic and the quartic potentials could be related together .",
    "we refer here to our companion paper  @xcite where we give a comprehensive presentation of finite volume effects on observable quantities .",
    "suffice is to say that even if one assumes @xmath23 has a self interacting quartic potential , a non - zero third order correlator might be observable .",
    "the reason is that one can not have access to genuine ensemble averages but to constrained ensemble averages such as @xmath91 which is the expectation value of @xmath92 for a given value of @xmath93 , average value of @xmath23 over the largest scale available in the survey in which the correlators are computed .",
    "to leading order in @xmath93 with respect to its variance , @xmath94 , this constrained average value reads @xmath95 if , for @xmath96 , the wavelengths @xmath97 are much smaller than the survey size then the expression of @xmath98 is that of @xmath99 when the self - interacting field @xmath23 evolves in the potential @xmath100 , which is the cubic term in @xmath23 in the expansion of @xmath101 .",
    "this shows that the two cases described in this paper are consistent with one another and that the functional relation between the two had to be expected .    to conclude we have established in this paper a number of generic results that put the tree - order computation of higher order correlations in a de sitter background on a secure ground",
    "we leave for further studies the examination of more realistic cases in which the background expansion is more complex .",
