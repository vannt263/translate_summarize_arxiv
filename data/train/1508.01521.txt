    "usually , computer tomography ( ct ) images are acquired for these purposes .",
    "the challenging aspects of liver segmentation in ct scan images can be summarized as follows : firstly , the overlapping boundaries between the liver and surrounding organs such as heart , stomach , right kidney , and spleen , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",

    "therefore , for accurate segmentation results , volume segmentation methods in 3d space are more efficient  @xcite .        in recent years , a variety of methods have been proposed to segment the liver . in 2007 ,",
