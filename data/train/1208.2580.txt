    "tornado circulation induced by water vapor condensation can be described as follows .",
    "condensation of water vapor in the adiabatically ascending air results in a drop of air pressure by @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is water vapor pressure at the earth s surface .",
    "the decrease of pressure along the vertical axis sustains the ascending air motion with vertical velocity @xmath2 and induces a compensating horizontal air inflow with radial velocity @xmath3 .",
    "the converging radial flow has maximal velocity at the surface , where the magnitude of the condensation - induced pressure drop is the largest .",
    "radial velocity approaches zero at a certain height @xmath4 , which approximately coincides with the cloud height . in the upper atmosphere at @xmath5",
    "the condensed water is transported away from the condensation area by the strong updraft and outgoing air flow .",
    "it precipitates at a considerable distance from the center of the condensation area .",
    "the continuity equation in the cylindrical system of coordinates relates radial @xmath3 and vertical @xmath2 velocities of the axially symmetrical vortex as @xmath6 .",
    "the vertical and horizontal pressure gradient forces induced by condensation are @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively . equating the power of the vertical and radial air flow , @xmath9 , and accounting for the continuity equation",
    ", we obtain @xmath10 .",
    "this corresponds to pressure potential @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "its exact derivation is given in work @xcite .",
    "for the high wind velocities of intense vortices to arise , the condensational pressure gradients within both tornadoes and hurricanes must significantly exceed turbulent friction .",
    "in such a case , the euler equations possess a bernoulli integral for the streamline : @xmath12 here @xmath3 , @xmath2 and @xmath13 are the radial , vertical and tangential velocities , respectively , @xmath14 is distance from the center of the condensation area , @xmath15 is the outer border of the condensation area , @xmath16 , @xmath17 is air density , @xmath18 is the velocity scale determined by water vapor condensation , @xmath19 is angular momentum per unit air mass , and @xmath20 is the region of converging streamlines ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "it is convenient to use the following units @xmath22 in these units , the bernoulli integral and the pressure potential become dimensionless @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",

    "is positive .",
    "the internal radius @xmath29 , where condensation ceases , is obtained by equating the last term in the round brackets in eqs .   and   to zero at @xmath30 , which is equivalent to @xmath31 .",
    "condensation commences at @xmath32 and ceases at @xmath33 at one and the same radial velocity @xmath34 . as follows from eq .",
    ", the following relationships are simultaneously satisfied : @xmath35 at @xmath29 all condensational potential energy is converted to the kinetic energy of rotation . at @xmath36 ,",
    "real solutions of eq .   for velocities",
    "@xmath3 , @xmath13 , and @xmath2 do not exist .",
    "equation   is a first - order differential equation with one boundary condition : @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) or @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "if at fixed @xmath41 one considers the constant @xmath42 in eq .   as a free parameter ,",
    "then in the general case the interval , where real solutions exist , does not include the point @xmath43 , which means that the maximum velocity @xmath44 is not reached and the tornado does not exist .",
    "tornado exists , when the interval of real solutions comprises the point @xmath33 defined by eq .  .",
    "solution of eq .",
    ", that is real within the range @xmath45 , is obtained by setting the boundary condition on @xmath27 at @xmath33 as @xmath46 and choosing @xmath42 at given @xmath34 , @xmath19 and @xmath47 such that @xmath37 .",
    "data of three - dimensional circulation ( the dependencies of the velocities @xmath3 , @xmath2 and @xmath13 on distance @xmath14 from the tornado center ) have only recently become available and exist for three tornadoes",
    ". we shall consider the mulhall tornado ( oklahoma , 3 may 1999 ) , which is the longest - lived ( 1 hour 20 min @xcite ) and longest - observed ( 18 min @xcite ) among the three as well as world s largest tornado on record @xcite .    according to empirical observations , the intense tornadoes can occur , when the mean relative humidity at @xmath48  km is not lower than 75 - 85% @xcite . at a characteristic surface temperature 30  @xmath49c @xcite and 80% relative humidity",
    "the vapor pressure at the surface is @xmath50  hpa . taking air density @xmath51  kg  m@xmath52 in eq .",
    ", we obtain the characteristic velocity @xmath53  m  s@xmath54 .",
    "velocities @xmath55 and @xmath34 at the external border @xmath56 must be the functions of translational velocity @xmath57 ( speed of movement of tornado as a whole ) .",
    "we put radial velocity @xmath58 @xcite , taking into account that the flux of moist air via tornado cross - section @xmath59 is equal to the flux via tornado circumference @xmath60 .",
    "we put tangential velocity @xmath61 assuming that the angular momentum of the main streamline that delivers moist air into the condensation area ( see , e.g. , fig .  8 in work @xcite ) is determined by the mean value of @xmath62 . here",
    "@xmath63 is a random angle between velocity at this streamline and radius - vector @xmath14 at the point @xmath15 , where the air enters the condensation area . from @xmath64",

    ", we obtain the eye radius @xmath68 from eq .  .",

    "[ fig1]a ) .",
    "the account of stationary eye rotation is made in the same way as in work @xcite , when a certain part of tangential kinetic energy developed in the condensation area is spent on solid - body rotation and creation of the pressure gradient in the eye of radius @xmath33 .",
    "this lowers tangential velocity in the transitional region @xmath73 between the condensation area and the eye , where @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "the expressions for tangential velocity and pressure at @xmath36 coincide with eqs .",
    "( 23)(25 ) in work @xcite .",
    "the empirical points shown in fig .  [ fig1]b characterize the mulhall tornado close to the time of peak intensity .",
    "they correspond to characteristic vertical velocity @xmath75 at @xmath76  m ( * ? ? ?",

    "4b ) and mean tangential velocity @xmath79 at @xmath80  m ( * ? ? ?",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig1]b that to the right side of the maximum the radial distribution of mean tangential velocity at @xmath81 conforms well to the assumption of conserved angular momentum .",
    "the choice of @xmath82  km is supported by observation that in this layer the radial velocity @xmath77 exceeds @xmath83",
    "m  s@xmath54 over considerable part of tornado circulation ( * ? ? ?",
    "( it should be noted that two other tornadoes , for which the data are available @xcite , have a significantly lower inflow level , @xmath84  m , than the mulhall tornado .",
    "mean tangential velocities do not follow the conserved angular momentum distribution .",
    "the decrease of angular momentum towards the center demands a more detailed consideration with additional parameters @xcite ) .",
    "total pressure fall as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a is @xmath85  hpa .",
    "this is in agreement with the few available direct measurements of tornado surface pressure . in the manchester tornado ( south dacota , 2003 ) , which was of the same ( f4 )",
    "intensity as the mulhall tornado , a pressure fall of 100  hpa was registered @xcite .",
    "with account of stationary eye rotation @xcite the maximum wind velocity @xmath86 ( and , correspondingly , the maximum kinetic energy ) is achieved at @xmath74 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) , where @xmath33 is a function of @xmath19 given by eq .  , fig .",
    "the earth rotation does not determine angular momentum in tornado due to the small linear size of the vortex .",
    "the value of @xmath19 is related to the translational velocity @xmath57 .",
    "this velocity can not be infinitely small : tornado exists at the expense of water vapor accumulated in the atmosphere and , hence , must move to sustain itself @xcite .",
    "maximum velocity attainable in the condensational vortex depends only weakly on angular momentum and grows rather slowly ( logarithmically ) with decreasing @xmath19 ( see fig .",

    ", @xmath89 does not exceed @xmath90  m  s@xmath54 .",
    "this agrees well with the available estimates of maximum wind speeds in tornadoes @xcite .",
    "the existence of vortex is related to a certain minimum value of radial velocity @xmath3 , which describes the atmospheric inertia with respect to the development of condensational circulation . at @xmath91",
    "condensation ceases .",
    "the condition @xmath92 corresponds to the following relationships @xmath93 this means that there is a minimum of @xmath77 at @xmath94 within @xmath95 .",
    "the existence of condensation at @xmath96 means that there is also a point @xmath97 , @xmath98 , where @xmath77 is maximum .",
    "it follows that there is a point @xmath99 , @xmath100 , where @xmath101 . at @xmath102",
    "there is no condensation and no condensational pressure potential to accelerate air .",
    "when @xmath103 the maximum vortex velocity , @xmath104 , is not reached : @xmath105",
    ". therefore , tornado exists , if the following condition @xmath106 is fulfilled ( @xmath107 for the vortex shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "analysis of eq .   shows that this condition is violated with increasing @xmath47 , which , at a fixed height of the atmosphere , corresponds to diminishing linear size @xmath32 of the condensation area . in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b , profiles of @xmath77 are shown for @xmath47 varying from @xmath108 to @xmath109 . at @xmath110",

    "decreasing @xmath19 at fixed @xmath47 also leads to increasing @xmath114 , fig .",
    "it follows that the smaller the horizontal size of the condensation area , the larger the angular momentum that is needed for a vortex to arise .",
