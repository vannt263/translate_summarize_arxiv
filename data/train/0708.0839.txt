    "the classical analogue of a quantum graph is a markovian process on the directed bonds @xcite with matrix @xmath25 of transition probabilities related to @xmath13 by @xmath26 thus @xmath25 is a doubly stochastic matrix , and hence it has dominant eigenvalue @xmath27 .",
    "it can be interpreted as the classical operator which induces a discrete time markovian evolution on the graph .",
    "the spectral gap @xmath28 is the gap between the leading eigenvalue @xmath27 and the second - largest eigenvalue of @xmath25 , in absolute value .",
    "it is conjectured that the rate of convergence of spectral statistics of quantum graphs to random matrix theory is governed by the rate of ergodicity in this markov evolution .",
    "more precisely , for a sequence of graphs with @xmath29 the eigenvalues of the quantum graph are given by random matrix theory if @xmath30 @xcite .",

    "the aims of the present manuscript can be summarised as follows :    1 .   to explain the motivations for studying graphs with equi - transmitting  vertex scattering matrices .",
    "2 .   to prove that equi - transmitting  vertex scattering matrices exist for arbitrarily large @xmath10 , and to provide practical methods to construct them .",
    "3 .   to investigate their spectral properties on both the classical ( gap estimates ) and the quantum ( spectral statistics ) levels .",
    "the next section will explain the motivation for introducing the equi - transmitting  scattering matrices .",
    "while equi - transmitting  matrices will be shown to have desirable qualities , an elementary calculation shows it is trivial to construct @xmath46 examples , but no @xmath47 equi - transmitting  matrix exists . in section [ construction ]",
    "we address the question of their existence in other dimensions , and provide several infinite sets of examples . whether equi - transmitting  matrices exist in all dimensions greater than three is an interesting open question . in section [ sec : properties ] we compare spectra of the matrix @xmath25 for graphs quantised with different scattering matrices .",
    "we find that in some fairly general situations the spectral gap in equi - transmittingquantum graphs is larger than that obtained with other scattering matrices . in section [ sec : numerics ]",
    "we present the results of numerical simulations using equi - transmitting  quantum graphs that show that random matrix statistics are reproduced .",
    "in this section we shall try to explain the motivations for the introduction of the equi - transmitting  vertex matrices .",
    "a fundamental building block in the spectral theory for quantum graphs and a key tool in understanding spectral correlations @xcite , is the trace formula @xcite .",
    "it relates the quantum spectrum of a graph , @xmath19 , to the length spectrum of its periodic orbits , expressed as an identity of distributions : @xmath48 the first term on the right - hand side of is the weyl term .",
    "@xmath49 denotes twice the total length of the graph , and plays the rle of the volume .",
    "the more interesting second term is a sum which goes over classes of closed itineraries on the graph equivalent up to cyclic permutations of the edges .",
    "we call these periodic orbits of the graph . the metric length of an orbit is denoted @xmath50 , and @xmath51 is the number of times the orbit is a repetition of a shorter one .",
    "the amplitude factor @xmath52 is the product of all elements of the vertex scattering matrices encountered as the orbit passes from one bond to the next .",
    "since equi - transmitting  matrices forbid back - scattering transitions , any orbit in which a traversal of a bond is followed immediately by the traversal of its reverse is eradicated from the sum .",
    "this significantly reduces the number of orbits which need to be considered  in fact the orbits that remain are exactly the closed geodesics considered in combinatorial graph theory which will be discussed below . for a @xmath10-regular graph the asymptotic number of orbits of period @xmath23 is reduced from @xmath53 to @xmath54 .",
    "we anticipate that using equi - transmitting  scattering matrices will significantly simplify periodic orbit theories in quantum graphs , and perhaps lead to new interesting problems and breakthroughs .",
    "the following will serve as an example : a theorem of gutkin and smilansky @xcite guarantees that one can `` hear '' the shape of a graph if the bond lengths are rationally independent and if the vertex scattering matrices are `` properly connecting '' .",
    "the equi - transmitting  scattering matrices do not belong to the latter class , and the question if one can `` hear '' equi - transmitting  graphs is open .",
    "the proof of the above mentioned theorem is based on the trace formula , and relies heavily on the special properties of the 2-periodic orbits which are absent from the trace formula of equi - transmitting  graphs .",
    "thus , a completely novel approach has to be developed .",
    "the study of quantum graphs with equi - transmitting  vertex scattering matrices leads to connections with objects that have been extensively studied in combinatorial graph theory , such as the ihara - selberg zeta function @xcite and its generalisations .",
    "one way to see this connection is by studying the spectrum of the classical evolution operation @xmath25 , which is defined as the zero set of the secular function @xmath55 \\label{eq : clasec } \\ .\\ ] ] this equation can be used to derive a classical ( rouelle like ) trace formula which is based on the periodic orbits on the graph weighted by the products of scattering probabilities along the orbit .",
    "when dealing with equi - transmitting  vertex scattering matrices , the trace formula ( and the corresponding zeta function ) includes only periodic orbits without back - scatter .",
    "these are the orbits which appear in the ihara - selberg zeta function and its extensions @xcite .",
    "moreover , the zeta functions are related by simple transformations , so that an interesting correspondence between the two seemingly unrelated problems can be established .",
    "we have mentioned previously the classical spectral gap @xmath28 , and its conjectured influence on the spectral statistics in the corresponding quantum graph . establishing bounds on @xmath28",
    "arises in the study of the ihara - selberg zeta function , which makes an intriguing link between spectral statistics and number theory .",
    "( see @xcite for a review of the connections between _ arithmetical _ zeta functions and spectral statistics . )",
    "we shall make use of these connections here ( see section [ sec : properties ] ) .",
    "we are not able to prove that graphs with equi - transmittingvertex scattering matrices display spectral statistics which reproduce the predictions of random matrix theory .",
    "we present , however , quite convincing numerical evidence showing that both their spectral repulsion and spectral rigidity adhere to the predictions of the canonical random matrix ensembles . whether this observation is valid and can be rigorously formulated is an open problem awaiting future research .",
    "in this section we shall show that the set of equi - transmitting  matrices is not empty or trivial .",
    "it is easy to construct equi - transmitting  matrices in dimension 2 .",
    "it is equally easy to show that equi - transmitting  matrices do not exist in dimension 3 .",
    "we are not able to provide a list of the dimensions for which equi - transmitting  matrices exist .",
    "we can , however , show that this list is infinite .",
    "we do it by constructing examples of equi - transmitting  matrices using skew - hadamard matrices @xcite , and dirichlet characters @xcite .",
    "[ def : hadamard ] a hadamard matrix @xmath56 is a matrix whose entries are @xmath57 , and whose columns are orthogonal . a skew - hadamard matrix is a hadamard matrix satisfying the additional condition @xmath58 .",

    "so we need only check unitarity .",

    "now that we have demonstrated the existence of equi - transmitting  matrices , we can study the quantum and classical evolutions which they induce .",
