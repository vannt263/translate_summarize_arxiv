    "studies of @xmath2 and @xmath3 meson decays shed light on many important aspects of particle physics , such as the extraction of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements , cp violation , rare decays , and hints of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "such decays involve not only the electroweak currents , but also strong interaction dynamics in the form of hadronic matrix elements .",
    "calculation of these matrix elements is crucial for high precision tests of the standard model .",
    "a very promising approach to determining hadronic matrix elements from first principles in qcd is provided by numerical simulations of hadrons using lattice gauge theory .",
    "studies of leptonic and semi - leptonic decays using lattice simulations have already been done using various techniques to handle heavy quarks on the lattice , such as the static approach@xcite , nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd)@xcite , and a reformulation of conventional wilson and clover lattice fermions@xcite . in each approach , the electroweak currents must be constructed in terms of appropriate operators comprised from the gluon and quark fields of the lattice theory by calculating the renormalization factors which relate the hadronic matrix elements in the lattice - regulated theory to those in the @xmath6 scheme .",
    "these factors are crucial for both decay constant and semi - leptonic form factor calculations . in this paper",
    ", we construct the time component of the heavy - light axial vector current in terms of operators suitable for simulations@xcite in which the heavy quark is treated using lattice nrqcd and the light quark propagates according to the @xmath4-improved clover action@xcite , where @xmath5 is the lattice spacing .",
    "the standard wilson action is used for the gluons .",
    "this construction is carried out to one - loop order in perturbation theory and to order @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the mass of the heavy quark .",
    "the expansion of the heavy - light axial vector current in terms of appropriate lattice operators is achieved by matching relevant scattering amplitudes in perturbation theory .",
    "consider the heavy - light pseudoscalar meson decay constant @xmath7 defined in some continuum renormalization scheme , such as @xmath6 , by , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the heavy - light axial vector current and @xmath10 is a pseudoscalar meson state of momentum @xmath11 .",
    "as will be seen , the axial vector current operator can be written as a sum of operators @xmath12 in the lattice - regulated theory .",
    "for instance , one finds that the temporal component , @xmath13 , is a sum of three operators which contribute through @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the qcd coupling : @xmath16 since the role of the dimensionless coefficients @xmath17 is to compensate for low - energy effects in the current operator from the loss of short - wavelength qcd modes in the lattice theory , one expects that , due to asymptotic freedom , they may be computed to a good approximation in perturbation theory .",
    "they are fixed by requiring that scattering amplitudes involving these current operators agree in continuum and lattice qcd to a given order in @xmath15 , @xmath5 , and @xmath0 . in a perturbative determination , a process involving quarks and gluons as asymptotic states may be used for this matching ; one need not consider hadron scatterings which are much more complicated to evaluate .",
    "note , however , that the @xmath17 coefficients are independent of the process chosen .",
    "a one - loop evaluation of the @xmath17 coefficients then involves the following steps : ( 1 ) select a quark - gluon scattering process induced by the heavy - light current and calculate the one - loop amplitude for this process in continuum qcd ; ( 2 ) expand the amplitude in powers of @xmath0 ; ( 3 ) identify operators in the lattice theory that reproduce the terms in this expansion ; ( 4 ) calculate the one - loop mixing matrix of these operators in the lattice theory ; ( 5 ) adjust the @xmath17 coefficients to produce a linear combination of lattice current operators whose one - loop scattering amplitude agrees with that from the @xmath6 current to a given order in @xmath0 and @xmath5 .",
    "note that the lattice currents are matched directly to the continuum qcd currents ; we do not need to use a two - step matching procedure in which the lattice currents are first matched to those in a continuum heavy - quark effective theory@xcite , which are then matched to the full qcd currents@xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , in sec .  [ sec : continuum ] , we discuss various issues relevant to our matching procedure , such as the choice of expansion parameter in the perturbation series , the definition of the heavy quark mass , the regularization of infrared divergences , and the selection of a renormalization scheme .",
    "next , a scattering process appropriate for constructing the heavy - light axial vector current in the lattice nrqcd - clover theory is chosen .",
    "we then discuss the continuum qcd calculations , and the necessary current operators in the lattice regularization scheme are identified .",
    "[ sec : lattice ] describes the mixing matrix calculation in the lattice theory .",
    "the scattering amplitudes in the continuum and lattice schemes are matched in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , and our main results , the values of the coefficients @xmath17 for various heavy quark mass values , are presented .",
    "renormalon ambiguities are discussed , and subtleties with infrared divergences for wilson light quarks are pointed out .",
    "our goal here is the expansion of the temporal component of the ( renormalized ) axial vector current in terms of ( bare ) operators suitable for use in lattice simulations of @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons .",
    "note that because the axial vector current is partially conserved in qcd , its operator does not actually require renormalization .",
    "this expansion is determined by matching suitable matrix elements evaluated both in continuum qcd and in the lattice theory . since this expansion is an operator relation , the expansion coefficients are independent of the external states of the matrix elements chosen . of course",
    ", the normalizations of the external states used in the continuum and lattice matrix elements must match in order to expose the required operator relation .",
    "since the external states in our perturbative calculations are free quark states , this can be done at tree level by matching the normalizations of the continuum and lattice dirac spinors ( to the appropriate order in @xmath5 ) .",
    "the use of _ on - shell _ wave function renormalization for both the heavy and light quark fields is then the simplest way to ensure this matching beyond tree level .    in matching the @xmath0 expansions of heavy - light matrix elements in the continuum and lattice theories , it is important to establish the relations between the quark mass parameters ( both heavy and light ) in each .",
    "equality of the lattice and continuum mass parameters can be ensured in perturbation theory using the pole mass definition .",
    "the pole mass is gauge - invariant and , within the context of perturbation theory , is a physical observable .",
    "hence , in our calculations , we use the pole mass for @xmath1 and also for the light quark mass @xmath18 . in using the pole mass definition for our quarks , we compute the continuum and lattice matrix elements using _ on - shell _ quark mass renormalization .",
    "note that since the pole mass is not defined outside of perturbation theory , it is not a useful quantity for lattice simulations ; the bare mass @xmath19 appearing in the lattice action is much more suitable .",
    "thus , once we determine the coefficients @xmath20 in terms of @xmath1 , we re - express our results in terms of @xmath21 using the perturbative relation between @xmath1 and @xmath19 .",
    "we must also know the relationship between the expansion parameters used in the continuum and lattice perturbative expressions in order to carry out the operator matching .",
    "for example , we could use @xmath22 in the continuum calculations and a coupling @xmath23 defined in terms of the momentum - space static quark potential @xmath24 in the lattice computations .",
    "the two couplings are related by @xmath25 .",
    "our one loop calculations do not make use of the @xmath26 correction in the relation between the lattice and continuum expansion parameters ; hence , as long as we use couplings which match at leading order , we can simply use @xmath15 to refer to both the lattice and continuum couplings .",
    "of course , when numerical values for the coefficients @xmath20 are needed , we must specify a renormalization scheme for @xmath15 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath20 depend on the ultraviolet regulator but contain no infrared divergences .",
    "however , our choice of on - shell mass and wave function renormalization will lead to infrared divergences at intermediate stages in our matrix element calculations . in order to demonstrate the cancellation of these divergences in the @xmath17 coefficients ,",
    "the same infrared regulator must be used in the evaluation of both the continuum and lattice matrix elements . since the triple gluon vertex plays no role in any of our feynman diagrams ,",
    "we introduce a gluon mass @xmath27 for this purpose .",
    "errors in our operator matching are measured in terms of powers of the lattice spacing @xmath5 , the qcd coupling @xmath15 , and the inverse heavy quark mass @xmath0 .",
    "however , nrqcd is a non - renormalizable effective field theory in which the lattice spacing can not be taken to zero ; rather , @xmath28 must be imposed .",
    "hence , our error determinations must take into account the fact that @xmath29 is of order unity .",
    "since we wish to construct a current operator which is correct through @xmath30 , we must remove all @xmath4 errors .",
    "we also remove all @xmath31 errors since it is easy and desirable to do so .",
    "the @xmath32 errors can be eliminated at tree - level in perturbation theory .",
    "the one - loop calculations are then used to remove the @xmath33 and @xmath34 errors .",
    "the remaining @xmath35 errors are much smaller than @xmath4 and @xmath33 and are expected to be comparable to @xmath36 .",

    "since @xmath183 has no tree - level contribution , at least a two - loop result is needed to check the convergence of its perturbative expansion .    as in all applications of perturbative qcd , nonperturbative contributions to @xmath17 are possible .",
    "for example , the perturbative expansions of the @xmath17 coefficients contain renormalon ambiguities arising from a slight mismatch between the infrared physics of the lattice theory and that of continuum qcd .",
    "this mismatch is caused by discretization artifacts and the truncation of the @xmath0 expansion . in our calculation , contributions coming from momenta small relative to a given infrared scale @xmath184 are all suppressed by @xmath185 or @xmath186 since the infrared structure of our lattice theory is designed to agree with continuum qcd through  @xmath187 .",
    "this infrared suppression is not true diagram - by - diagram ( some diagrams are even infrared divergent ) , but the infrared contribution is suppressed by @xmath188 or @xmath189 when all diagrams are summed .",
    "for example , in some analyses@xcite , coefficients like @xmath170 are separated into the contribution @xmath190 from the leading operator ( here @xmath191 ) and contributions @xmath192 from mixings with higher - dimension operators ( here @xmath193 and @xmath194 ) . in our analysis",
    ", such a separation is artificial and would be a mistake since it induces @xmath187 ambiguities in the separate pieces @xmath190 and @xmath192 .",
    "these ambiguities cancel when the pieces are recombined , leaving contributions to @xmath170 suppressed by @xmath185 or @xmath186 .",
    "thus , any renormalon ambiguities are suppressed by the same factors and are at worst comparable to the other truncation errors in the analysis .",
    "our calculation differs from conventional lattice calculations in that the @xmath188  truncation errors , perturbative and nonperturbative , can not be made arbitrarily small by reducing the lattice spacing@xcite .",
    "this is because nrqcd has nonrenormalizable interactions whose couplings do not vanish as @xmath195 .",
    "the perturbative expansions for @xmath17 have power - law terms of the form @xmath196 which ruin the convergence of perturbation theory if @xmath5 is taken to zero . in practice",

    "fundamentally limits the precision of our @xmath187  accurate formalism .",
    "if improved precision is needed , we must reduce the truncation errors by using more accurate discretizations of the lattice currents and action . in this way truncation errors , renormalon ambiguities , etc .",
    "are pushed off to @xmath199 or higher .",
    "this approach differs dramatically from that used in the static - quark expansion ; in the latter approach , problems with power divergences arise when the limit @xmath198 is attempted in a brute - force manner .",
    "the role of the power - law terms in the @xmath17 coefficients is to cancel unphysical power - divergent contributions in the lattice nrqcd current matrix elements , thereby ensuring the correct matching to full continuum qcd through the relevant order in @xmath15 and @xmath0 .",
    "if the unphysical terms behaving as @xmath196 in the @xmath17 coefficients and the current matrix elements become comparable to or larger than the physical terms of @xmath200 , this cancellation becomes a very delicate issue and the need for nonperturbative subtraction methods may arise .",
    "such is the case in the static - quark expansion ; taking the brute - force limit @xmath198 obscures the physically relevant contributions by amplifying the power - divergent unphysical terms . here , this problem is circumvented by keeping the lattice spacing large enough that @xmath197 never becomes large .",
    "the success of low - order perturbation theory in cancelling the unphysical terms depends , of course , on the relative size of the physical contributions .",
    "recent numerical simulations@xcite find no evidence of large power - law contamination in the current matrix elements for the range of @xmath21 appropriate for @xmath201-quark physics , suggesting that power - divergent nonperturbative and higher - order perturbative contributions to the matching coefficients are also not large .",
    "this finding applies to the temporal component of the heavy - light axial vector current . for other operators ,",
    "the situation could be different and each case must be examined separately .    the results in table  [ tab : two ] are suitable for values of @xmath21 appropriate for current simulations of heavy - light systems using nrqcd",
