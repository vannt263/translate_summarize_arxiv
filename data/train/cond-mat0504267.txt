    "the possibility of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) phase transition occuring in a 2d geometry has a remarkable history and breakthroughs .",
    "recent experiments have realized a quasi - two - dimensional ( q2d ) cold bose gas by tuning the anisotropy of the trapping potential @xcite .",
    "this achievement has attracted vast attention on the new physics appearing in the currently studied low - dimensional trapped gases and the nature of finite - size and finite - temperature effects .",
    "the effect of dimensionality on the existence and character of bec or superfluid phase transition has seen a spurt of interest in recent years .",
    "a peculiar feature of the low - dimensionality ( 1d or 2d geometry ) at finite temperature is the absence of a true condensate following the bogoliubov @xmath0 theory , believed to be originated from the long wave - length phase fluctuations @xcite .",
    "this has been proved in the seminal work of mermin and wagner @xcite and hohenberg @xcite .",
    "a kosterlitz - thouless transition to a superfluid state still occurs on cooling through the binding of vortices of opposite vorticity @xcite and leads to an algebraic decay of the one - body density matrix .",
    "however , in a trapped 2d fluid the modification of the density of states caused by the confining potential allow a true condensate to exist even at finite temperature .",
    "another important consequence lower dimensionality is that the t - matrix for two - body collisions _ in vacuo _ at low momenta and energy in the dilute regime vanishes @xcite .",
    "it is then necessary to evaluate the scattering processes between pairs of bose particles by taking into account the presence of surrounding condensate particles @xcite .",
    "the dilute limit ( @xmath1 ) , where @xmath2 is the uniform density of particles and @xmath3 is the s - wave scattering length of a bose gas can be described quite satisfactorily by traditional approaches , such as the gross - pitaevskii(gp ) approach in the weakly interacting regime @xcite .",
    "however , it is intuitively obvious that as the density of particles in the condensate or the scattering length increases , the nature of interactions will become more and more complex , and one will need to take even three - body and higher order effects into account .",
    "it is a crucial point since in the strictly two - dimensional trap , the scattering length of the bosons become larger than the axial thickness of the condensate cloud .",
    "thus we need to go beyond the mean - field approach to describe the system of dense bose gas .",
    "these limitations motivates me to address the problem particularly the 2d dense condensate by introducing the slave boson model ( sb ) which is valid for arbitrary density regimes .",
    "the slave boson technique was first introduced by kotliar and ruckenstein @xcite , who used it to deal with the fermionic hubbard model .",
    "a functional integral approach to the problem of hard - core bosons hopping on a lattice has been previously put forward by ziegler @xcite and frsard @xcite .",
    "ziegler @xcite has demonstrated that slave boson ( sb ) representation allows one to describe the dynamics of bose gas taking into account three - body and higher effects at arbitrary densities for the three - dimensional ( 3d ) case .",
    "the advantage of using slave boson representation is by the fact that there are only two states per site in a hard - core system : a lattice site is either empty or occupied by a single boson .",
    "a hopping process of a boson appears as an exchange of an empty site with singly occupied site .",
    "the paper is outlined as follows . in section 2 the bose gas with hard - core interaction defined as an effective functional integral form",
    "is summarized in the slave boson formalism .",
    "the sb equation is evaluated in section 3 .",
    "some concluding remarks are presented in section 4 .",
    "a bose gas , defined as a grand canonical ensemble of bosons , can be described in a second quantization formalism , for instance using a functional integral representation @xcite as following : @xmath4/\\hbar)\\prod d[\\phi^{*}]d[\\phi ]   \\label{funcint}\\ ] ] where the euclidean action @xmath5 $ ] of the complex field @xmath6 needs to be defined accordingly to the model system of interest ( _ e.g. _ gp , sb , ect . ) . in this work",
    "i will resort to the slave boson representation of hard - core bosons which has been exhaustively defined in the literatures @xcite .",
    "the representation relies on the bose - hubbard model where the particle trades its position with an empty site on the lattice . both particle as well as the empty site",
    "are described by the corresponding creation and annihilation operators . in the slave boson representation for instance , a lattice site @xmath7 that is occupied by boson",
    "is represented by complex field @xmath8 and a site that is empty by @xmath9 .",
    "thus the slave boson action @xmath10 can be translated into the following picture @xcite @xmath11 where the first term describes the exchange of bosons and empty sites in a hopping process at sites @xmath7 and @xmath12 with rate @xmath13 . in the second term",
    "i have introduced an external confining potential @xmath14 .",
    "the field @xmath15 in the last term of the above equation enforces a constraint @xmath16 which guarantees that a site is either empty or singly occupied .",
    "it is indeed the core condition of the slave boson model . with this choice of action , the functional integral in eq .",
    "( [ funcint ] ) can be written explicitly describing the partition function of the grand canonical ensembles of bosons as : @xmath17 the slave boson field @xmath9 and @xmath8 can be combined to form a collective field @xmath18",
    ". then the constraint field @xmath15 and the slave bosons fields can be integrated out which finally leads to the action for the collective field @xmath19 .",
    "this was demonstrated in detail in @xcite .",
    "here , i only present the results : @xmath20 with the hopping(``kinetic '' ) term @xmath21 and the potential term @xmath22\\frac{\\sinh\\sqrt{(\\varphi - v_{x}^2)^{2 } + |\\phi_{x}|^2}}{\\sqrt{(\\varphi - v_{x}^2)^{2}+|\\phi_{x}|^2 } }   \\right ) .",

    "the density of the condensate in the trap can be calculated by the saddle - point approximation . in this work ,",
    "we neglect the thermal fluctuations which is not important at zero temperatures for bose - einstein condensation to occurs in the system .",
    "however , if one needed to account for the thermal fluctuations , one could do so by studying the deviations around the saddle point in the functional integral of eq .",

    "the main effect of the correlation potentials can be observed where the condensate density reaches the peak at the trap center .",

    "the effect of exchange - correlation clearly shows a reduction in effective interaction energy thus the profiles are more localized at the centre of the trap in comparison to the gp case .",
    "this argument can also be supported by the observation in fig ( [ figcoup ] ) where the magnitude of homogeneous exchange correlation energies decreases as the density increases . on the other hand",
    "@xmath48 $ ] is negligible for the very dilute regimes @xmath86 justifying gp approximation is only a good model in this limit",
    "in summary , the harmonically trapped 2d bose gas at zero temperature described by the slave boson model has been studied for both the dilute and dense limits .",
    "the central issue of this work is in how to treat the slave boson term @xmath87 in the highly non - linear partial differential equation ( [ sb ] ) .",
    "the importance of the higher order interactions @xmath28 the exchange - correlation energy has been revealed by mapping eq . ( [ sb ] ) to the kohn - sham scheme of dft in the dense limit . this latter term is responsible for the correction of up to 9@xmath78 and 13@xmath78 of the peak density for @xmath88 and @xmath89 atoms at the center of trap . in other words",
    "these exchange correlation has restored the correct high density behaviour of the inhomogeneous bose condensate imposed by the strict hard - core condition of the slave - boson representation . on the opposite dilute regime",
    "i have demonstrated that the slave boson equation ( [ sb ] ) can be approximated to a gross - pitaevskii type equation ( _ via _ dft ) .    at absolute zero temperature where the thermal fluctuation is frozen out and quantum fluctuation is prominent .",
