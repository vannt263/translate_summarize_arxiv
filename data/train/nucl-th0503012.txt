    "in addition there exist approximate schemes : the most brutal one is the description without coulomb for the three - nucleon system with two protons at those energies and in those kinematical regimes in which the coulomb interaction is believed to be irrelevant for observables ; such an approximation has become standard in recent years  @xcite , and , to our own guilt , we admit having used it  @xcite .",

    "in particular , the results of this paper are based on the purely nucleonic charge - dependent ( cd ) bonn potential  @xcite and on its coupled - channel extension cd bonn + @xmath1 @xcite , allowing for a single virtual @xmath1-isobar excitation and fitted to the experimental data with the same degree of accuracy as cd bonn itself . in the three - nucleon system",
    "the @xmath1 isobar mediates an effective three - nucleon force and effective two- and three - nucleon currents , both consistent with the underlying effective two - nucleon force . a reliable technique @xcite for solving the three - particle alt - grassberger - sandhas ( ags ) equation  @xcite without coulomb is at our disposal .",
    "we extend that technique to include the screened coulomb potential between the protons .",
