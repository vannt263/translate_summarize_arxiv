    "the nernst law or third law of thermodynamics comes in two versions . the weak version , which states that zero temperature can only be reached asymptotically , is uncontroversial . in constrast , there is an ongoing discussion about the status of the strong version , originally formulated by planck , which states that entropy goes to zero at zero temperature .",
    "see for example @xcite for contrasting views on this .",
    "with regard to gauge / gravity duality , there is a natural tension between condensed matter systems , where the strong version is believed to apply generally or at least generically , and bps and other extremal black hole solutions , where a regular , and hence normally finite , horizon is associated with a finite , and typically large entropy .",
    "this raises the question whether and how systems obyeing the strong version of the nernst law can be modelled by gravitational counterparts .",
    "extremal black brane solutions obeying the strong version of the nernst law have been found in a variety of theories @xcite , including four - dimensional fi - gauged supergravity @xcite , where they were dubbed nernst branes .",
    "more recently , a two - parameter family of nernst branes parametrized by temperature @xmath4 and a chemical potential @xmath5 was found in @xcite .",
    "asymptotically , these solutions approach hyperscaling violating lifshitz ( ` hvlif ' ) geometries both at infinity and at the horizon , and therefore are interesting in the context of gauge / gravity duality with hyperscaling violation @xcite , see also @xcite and references therein . four - dimensional nernst branes share the typical problems of hvlif geometries , in that they exhibit curvature singularities @xcite . moreover the scaling properties of the geometry at infinity suggested an entropy  temperature relation of the form @xmath6 , while the high - temperature asymptotics extracted from the equation of state was found to be @xmath7 . since in addition the scalars showed runaway behaviour at infinity , and the relation @xmath6 is valid for ads@xmath0 , it was conjectured in @xcite that the inconsistent uv behaviour of four - dimensional nernst branes signals a dynamical decompactification , and that the above problem would be cured by lifting the solutions to five dimensions .",
    "this follows the general idea that scale covariant vacua can be obtained by dimensional reduction of scale invariant vacua @xcite .",
    "in this paper we will verify this proposal and study the relation between five - dimensional and four - dimensional nernst branes in detail .",
    "the five - dimensional nernst branes will be constructed within fi - gauged minimal five - dimensional supergravity with an arbitrary number of vector multiplets , by dimensional reduction to an effective three - dimensional euclidean theory and using the special geometry of the scalar sector .",
    "we will show that the singular asymptotic behaviour of four - dimensional nernst branes is a compactification artefact , and that the ground state geometry is ads@xmath0 . a crucial role in understanding the relation between five- and four - dimensional nernst branes",
    "is played by the compactification circle , whose size changes dynamically along the direction transverse to the brane .",
    "the behaviour of this circle also solves another puzzle , namely the origin of the four - dimensional chemical potential .",
    "five - dimensional nernst branes turn out to be boosted ads schwarzschild branes , depending on two continuous parameters , the temperature @xmath4 , and the linear momentum @xmath8 .",
    "since momentum turns into electric charge upon dimensional reduction , one might naively expect that four - dimensional nernst branes depend on one continuous parameter , temperature @xmath4 and on one discrete parameter , electric charge @xmath9 .",
    "however , the solutions of @xcite depend on an additional continuous parameter , the chemical potential @xmath5 .",
    "as it turns out , its origin can be traced to the fact that the compactification circle grows towards infinity and towards the horizon , and has a minimum in between .",
    "this minimum introduces a new scale , and since the minimal value of the radius can be varied continuously , this provides an additional continuous parameter .",
    "the boosted ads schwarzschild metric we obtain by solving the five - dimensional equations of motion is an einstein metric and can be brought to carter - novotn - horsk form .",
    "such metrics describe the near horizon regions of dimensionally reduced d - branes and m - branes with superimposed pp - waves @xcite .",
    "this does , however , not immediately provide us with a string theory embedding of our solutions , unless we switch off the vector multiplets .",
    "the solution we find is valid for an arbitrary number of vector multiplets , and depends on the choice of the prepotential and on the choice of an fi - gauging through parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "while the scalars are constant , they still have to extremize the scalar potential , and therefore these parameters determine the effective cosmological constant , and enter into the various integration constants of our solution",
    ". we will give explicit expressions in the paper .",
    "fi - gauged five - dimensional @xmath12 supergravity has so far only been obtained as a consistent truncation of a higher - dimensional supergravity in a very limited number of cases .",
    "the case without vector multiplets , that is pure gauged five - dimensional @xmath12 supergravity , can be obtained by reduction of iib supergravity on sasaki - einstein manifolds @xmath13 @xcite . the stu - model and consistent truncations thereof",
    "can be obtained as consistent reductions of eleven - dimensional supergravity @xcite .",
    "other consistent truncations involve hypermultiplets or massive vector multiplets and consequently have different types of gauging @xcite .",
    "the dimensionally reduced boosted d3-branes of @xcite which lead to the same five - dimensional metric should be considered as solutions of five - dimensional gauged @xmath14 supergravity , which can be obtained by reduction of iib supergravity on @xmath15 . in this case",
    "the five - dimensional cosmological constant is simply determined by the d3-charge , and we can not account for the parameters @xmath16 of an fi - gauged supergravity theory with vector multiplets .",
    "but while there is no obvious string theory embedding of our solutions , the five - dimensional metric is still the same as for boosted d3-branes .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to assume that at least the same type of dictionary between geometry and field theory will apply .",
    "we will come back to this in the conclusions . throughout the paper we keep a strictly five - dimensional perspective and work with relations between geometric and thermodynamical quantities without using any higher - dimensional or stringy input .",
    "our work includes a detailed study of the thermodynamical properties of five - dimensional nernst branes .",
    "using the quasilocal energy momentum tensor we construct expressions for the mass @xmath17 and momentum @xmath8 . from the near horizon behaviour of the solution we obtain the entropy @xmath18 and through the surface gravity of the killing horizon , the temperature @xmath4 .",
    "we verify the validity of the first law , as well as the strong version of the third law .",
    "the solution is shown to be thermodynamically stable .",
    "we obtain an equation of state and show that the relation between entropy and temperature interpolates between @xmath6 at high temperature and @xmath19 at low temparture .",
    "this asymptotic behaviour agrees with the literature on boosted d3-branes@xcite and verifies the prediction of @xcite .",
    "one subtlety is that the metric admits a reparametrisation , which naively removes the integration constant corresponding to the temperature ( as long as temperature is non - zero ) from the solution .",
    "however , as the detailed analysis shows , when properly setting up thermodynamics using the quasi - local stress energy tensor , temperature is defined by a reparametrisation invariant expression .",
    "the additional input that thermodynamics requires is the choice of the norm of the static killing vector field , which should be considered as part of the choice of the ads@xmath0 groundstate .",
    "besides the trivial extremal limit , which is global ads@xmath0 , the solution admits a non - trivial double scaling limit , where temperature goes to zero , and the boost parameter goes to infinity while the momentum ( density ) is kept fixed .",
    "this limit was studied ( in different coordinates ) in @xcite , where it was shown to result in a homogenoeus einstein space of kaigorodov type , which is 1/4 bps .",
    "this analysis applies to our solution and implies that it supports 2 out of a maximum of 8 killing spinors . in the extremal limit",
    "we also recover the five - dimensional extremal nernst branes of @xcite .",
    "there are interesting parallels as well as differences between boosted ads schwarzschild black branes and rotating black holes .",
    "like for a kerr black hole , boosted branes have an ` ergoregion ' that is a region before the event horizon where observers can not stay static any more , but have to co - translate with the brane .",
    "also , the euclidean continuation of such a brane looks very similar to that of a kerr black hole , and allows to derive the temperature by imposing the absence of a conical deficit . in other aspects",
    "the analogy breaks down , however .",
    "while supersymmetric rotating black holes can not have an ergosphere @xcite , the ergoregion of an infinitely boosted black brane remains .",
    "we show that this is consistent with supersymmetry , because the killing vector obtained as a killing spinor bilinear is null rather than timelike",
    ". since we are interested in how the lift to five dimensions affects the curvature singularities of four - dimensional nernst branes , we work out explicit expressions for the five- and four - dimensional curvature in our preferred coordinate systems .",
    "part of these results have been obtained in the previous literature , and where results can be compared , we find agreement .",
    "our own contribution is to explicitly demonstrate how singular four - dimensional asymptotic hvlif metrics , when combined with the four - dimensional scalars encoding the dynamics of an additional compact direction , lift consistently to a geometry asymptotic to ads@xmath0 .",
    "this does not only show that the hvlif singularities are artefacts resulting from , as one might say , a ` bad slicing ' of ads@xmath0 , but the mechanism is dynamical in the sense that the run - away of the four - dimensional scalars encodes the decompactification of the fifth dimension .",
    "this removes all the sp curvature singularities and run - away behaviour of scalars that four - dimensional nernst branes exhibit at asymptotic infinity .",
    "in addition , four - dimensional nernst branes also have pp curvature singularities which lead to infinite tidal forces acting on freely falling observers .",
    "these occur at the horizon , and only at zero temperature .",
    "they are again accompanied by run - away behaviour of the scalar fields , which encodes the dynamical decompactification of a fifth dimension .",
    "but in contrast to what happens at asymptotic infinity under decompactification , the pp singularity of the asymptotic hvlif space @xcite is not removed but lifted to the pp singularity of a five - dimensional kaigorodov - type space - time @xcite .",
    "this shows that pp singularities and infinite tidal forces are intricately related to the vanishing of the entropy ( density ) , thus bringing us back full circle to the third law .",
    "we will continue this discussion in the final section .      in section 2 we review five - dimensional @xmath20 fi gauged supergravity with vector multiplets and its dimensional reduction to three euclidean dimensions . in section 3 we obtain five - dimensional nernst branes by solving the three - dimensional effective equations of motion and lifting the solution back to five dimensions .",
    "we solve the full second order equations of motion but observe that imposing regularity conditions reduces the number of parameters by one half , so that the solution will satisfy a unique set of first order equations , despite being non - extremal . by a coordinate transformation",
    "the solution can be brought to the form of a boosted ads schwarzschild black brane , and further to a metric of carter - novotn - horsk type .",
    "we work out the thermodynamics in full detail , investigate the extremal limit , compare geometrical properties to those of rotating black holes , and analyse the behaviour of curvature . in section 4 we perform a reduction to four dimensions and show that we recover the four - dimensional nernst branes of @xcite .",
    "the relations between the geometrical and thermodynamical properties of five - dimensional and four - dimensional nernst branes is worked out in detail . in section 5",
    "we interpret the results , obtain a consistent picture which ties together five- and four - dimensional nernst branes , and discuss its interpretation in the context of the gauge / gravity correspondence .",
    "we also come back to the question of a higher - dimensional string theory embedding , and use the fact that our solutions have the same metric as reduced boosted d3-branes to set up a gauge / gravity dictionary .",
    "we briefly explain how the method used in this paper to generate solutions can be applied to find more general solutions in the future .",
    "finally we discuss open questions regarding the fate of pp curvature singularities and of the third law .",
    "various technical details have been relegated to appendices .",
    "appendix a derives certain re - writings of the scalar potential , which are used in the main text .",
    "appendix b contains the details of computing thermodynamic quantities using the quasi - local energy - momentum tensor .",
    "while in section 3 the hawking temperature is obtained from the surface gravity of the killing horizon , appendix c presents an alternative derivation using the euclidean approach .",
    "this allows to again compare boosted branes to rotating black holes .",
    "appendices d and e give the details for computing tidal forces in five and in four dimensions , respectively .",
    "these details have been included to give , in combination with the main text , a full and self - contained account of curvature in five and four dimensions . in appendix",
    "f we spell out the details of a ` well known ' fact about the normalization of vector potentials , for completeness , and because we are not aware of an easily digestible and sufficiently detailed explanation in the literature .",
    "we start with the five - dimensional lagrangian for @xmath20 gauged supergravity coupled to @xmath21 vector multiplets @xcite .",
    "our conventions for the ungauged sector follow those of @xcite , albeit with the opposite sign for the einstein - hilbert term : @xmath22 with @xmath23 . here",
    "@xmath24 are five - dimensional lorentz indices , while @xmath25 label the five - dimensional gauge fields .",
    "we use a formulation of the theory where the @xmath21-dimensional scalar manifold @xmath26 is parametrised by @xmath27 scalar fields @xmath28 which are subject to real scale transformations .",
    "this formulation is natural in the context of the superconformal calculus and will turn out to be helpful for finding solutions .",
    "the construction of the theory of five - dimensional vector multiplets coupled to supergravity using the superconformal calculus can be found in @xcite , while the superconformal method in general is reviewed in @xcite .",
    "we will in addition use the formulation of special real geometry developed in @xcite .    as explained in more detail in @xcite , the scalars @xmath28 are special coordinates on an open domain @xmath29 , which is invariant under the action of the group @xmath30 by scale transformations .",
    "the manifold @xmath31 is the scalar manifold of an auxiliary theory of @xmath27 superconformal vector multiplets , from which a theory of @xmath21 vector multiplets coupled to poincar supergravity is obtained by gauge fixing .",
    "@xmath32 is a so - called conic affine special real ( casr ) manifold .",
    "this means that it carries a hessian metric which transforms with weight 3 under the @xmath33-action .",
    "when choosing special coordinates , which are affine coordinates with respect to the hessian structure and transform with weight 1 under scale transformations , the hesse potential is a homogeneous cubic polynomial , @xmath34 . in this way",
    "one recovers the original definition of @xcite .",
    "the physical scalar manifold of the supergravity theory can be identified with the hypersurface @xmath35 defined by @xmath36 note that the @xmath30-action is transverse to this hypersurface , so that we can identify @xmath37 .",
    "this is a real version of the superconformal quotients for four - dimensional vector multiplets and for hypermultiplets .",
    "the manifold @xmath38 will be referred to as a projective special real ( psr ) manifold . in the lagrangian ( [ 5dlagr ] )",
    "we use the special coordinates @xmath28 , but it is understood that the constraint ( [ hs ] ) has been imposed . within the superconformal calculus",
    "this constraint is the ` d - gauge ' which gauge fixes the local dilatations of the auxiliary superconformal theory in order to obtain the associated poincar supergravity theory in its conventional form . in ( [ 5dlagr ] ) this is reflected by the einstein - hilbert term having its dimension - full prefactor @xmath39 , rather than being multiplied by a conformal compensator to make it scale invariant .    in ( [ 5dlagr ] )",
    "we have chosen to express both the scalar and the vector couplings using the symmetric , positive definite tensor field @xmath40 here we use a notation which suppresses indices which are summed over : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , etc . the tensor @xmath43 is a positive definite hessian metric with hesse potential @xmath44 on @xmath32 . while it is different from the conical hessian metric @xmath45 , which has lorentz signature , with the negative eigendirection along the orbits of the @xmath33-action , the pullbacks of both metrics to the hypersurface @xmath38 agree , so that one can use either to obtain the positive definite metric @xmath46 which encodes the self - couplings of the @xmath21 physical scalars .",

    "we remark that while on the physical scalar manifold we have to impose the constraint @xmath53 , we have kept factors of @xmath54 explicit in and .",
    "this is useful in keeping track of the scaling weights of fields , and thus checking that expressions are consistent with the scaling properties of the corresponding gauge - equivalent superconformal theory .",
    "we have chosen our conventions such that the scaling weights of the fields used in ( [ 5dlagr ] ) match with @xcite .",
    "in particular , we take @xmath55 as a quick check , note that the lagrangian has scaling weight 5 , so that the resulting action has scaling weight 0 .",
    "further , provided that we include the appropriate factors of @xmath54 , the functions @xmath47 and @xmath56 are homogeneous in @xmath28 , even in presence of the dimension - full factors @xmath57 and @xmath11 , which appear after imposing d - gauge .",

    "we now want to reduce the five - dimensional theory to three ( euclidean ) dimensions .",
    "we make the metric ansatz @xmath59 where all fields depend only on the coordinates of the three - dimensional space .",

    "however , after performing the dimensional reduction over @xmath62 , the @xmath66 direction will always be time - like in four dimensions , and so we are able to use the same dimensional reduction technique as in @xcite , i.e.  we reduce over both a space - like and time - like direction .",

    "we find @xmath180 in order that this be finite and non - zero we therefore require @xmath181 which , given , is equivalent to @xmath182 , further resulting in @xmath183 . hence , the physicality constraint further reduces the number of independent integration constants by one .    before moving on to study properties of the solution , we summarise the story so far . the functions appearing in the five - dimensional line element are given by @xmath184 whilst the scalar fields @xmath28 parametrising the casr manifold are constant and given by @xmath185    we have therefore found a family of solutions to the equations of motion  depending on three non - negative parameters @xmath186 .",
    "since the field equations for the three - dimensional scalars @xmath187 are of second order , and our ansatz amounts to three independent scalar fields ( since the @xmath71 have been taken to be proportional ) , we should a priori have expected six independent integration constants . however , as we have seen , physical regularity conditions imposed on the lifted , higher - dimensional solution reduces the number of integration constants by one half .",
    "this is consistent with physical solutions being uniquely characterised by a system of first order flow equations , despite that the equations of motion are of second order , as has been observed for other types of solutions before @xcite .",
    "we further remark that since the physical five - dimensional scalar fields have turned out to be constant , their only contribution is to generate an effective cosmological constant , whose value is determined by the value of the scalar potential at the corresponding stationary point . since no five - dimensional gauge fields have been turned on , our solution , which is valid for any five - dimensional vector multiplet theory , can therefore be obtained from an effective action , which only contains the einstein - hilbert term together with a cosmological constant , while the gauge fields and scalar fields have been integrated out .",
    "we introduce a new ` radial ' ( more accurately : transversal ) coordinate @xmath188 via @xmath189 so that the near horizon region is at @xmath190 , and the asymptotic region is at @xmath191 .",

    "the boosted black brane has similarities with kerr - like black holes , with the linear momentum related to the boost playing a role analogous to the angular momentum .",
    "it is instructive to work this out in some detail , following the discussion of the kerr solution in @xcite .",
    "let us first look for the existence of static observers , who remain at constant @xmath258 and as such have velocities parallel to the killing vector field @xmath259 . therefore static observers exist in regions where @xmath259 is timelike , and the limit of staticity is at the value of @xmath233 where @xmath260 this `` ergosurface '' is always located outside the event horizon , with the trivial exception of globally static ( unboosted )",
    "spacetimes for which @xmath261 and the two surfaces overlap completely .",
    "this is different to the rotating case where ergosurface and event horizon always coincide at the north and south pole .",
    "+ beyond the limit of staticity there still exist stationary observers which are co - moving ( more precisely , but less elegantly ` co - translating ' ) with the brane .",
    "observers which have fixed @xmath262 and a constant velocity in the @xmath219-direction have world lines tangent to killing vector fields @xmath263 where the quantity @xmath264 will be referred to as the velocity .",
    "such co - moving observers exist in regions where @xmath265 is time - like . killing vector fields of the form",
    "@xmath265 become null for values of @xmath233 where @xmath266 thus there is a finite range of velocities @xmath70 , given by @xmath267 , which co - moving observers can attain .",
    "note that at the limit of staticity , where @xmath268 , we find that @xmath269 . therefore @xmath70 must be negative once the limit of staticity has been passed .",
    "the limit for co - moving observers is reached when @xmath270 , which happens at the point where @xmath271 it is straightforward to verify that this happens at the same value @xmath231 of @xmath233 where @xmath272 .",
    "the limiting velocity @xmath273 is given by @xmath274 and can be interpreted as the boost - velocity of the surface @xmath275 . since @xmath272 implies that @xmath276 , it follows that on this surface outgoing null congruences have zero expansion , see @xcite for the analogous case of a rotating black hole .",
    "consequently @xmath275 is an apparent horizon , and since the solution is stationary , an event horizon .",
    "moreover this event horizon is a killing horizon for the vector field @xmath277 and we can interpret @xmath273 as the boost - velocity of this horizon . observe that the limit of staticity and the limit of stationarity are in general different , and only agree in the unboosted limit @xmath278 where we recover the ads schwarzschild black brane .",
    "we note that there is frame dragging in our solutions , since the metric is non - static for @xmath279 .",
    "indeed , since the metric coefficients are independent of @xmath280 and @xmath219 , the covariant momentum components @xmath281 and @xmath282 are conserved .",
    "but even when setting @xmath283 , particles have a non - vanishing contravariant momentum component @xmath284 in the @xmath219-direction .",
    "the boost velocity of the metric varies between the horizon and infinity .",

    "an observer at fixed @xmath288 is co - moving with the space - time if their velocity is @xmath289 . bringing the metric to the above form one finds @xmath290 with limits @xmath291 { } - \\frac{u_z}{u_t } = w \\geq - 1\\;,\\ ] ] and @xmath292 { } 0 \\;.\\ ] ]",
    "it is straightforward to check that for @xmath293 the boost speed @xmath294 is strictly monontonically increasing from @xmath295 at infinity to @xmath296 at the horizon .",
    "thus the boost speed is bounded by the speed of light and can only reach it at the horizon and in the extremal limit .",
    "note that the asymptotic ads space at infinity is not co - moving .",
    "this is different from kerr - ads , where the asymptotic ads space is co - rotating , with implications for the black brane thermodynamics @xcite . in particular",
    ", we will not need to subtract a background term , corresponding to the asymptotic ads space , from our expressions for the boost - velocity in order to have quantities satisfying the first law of thermodynamics .",
    "we will come back to this later when verifying the first law .      in this section ,",
    "we consider the properties of the extremal solution in further detail .",
    "we begin by considering the solution ( [ extmetric ] ) . on making the co - ordinate transformation @xmath297 the metric ( [ extmetric ] ) becomes @xmath298 the",
    "metric ( [ kaig1 ] ) is a five - dimensional generalized kaigorodov metric , constructed in @xcite , which describes gravitational waves propagating in ads@xmath299 .",
    "the supersymmetry of this solution was investigated in @xcite , where it was shown that this solution preserves 1/4 of the supersymmetry .",
    "furthermore , after making some appropriate co - ordinate transformations , this solution can be shown to correspond to a class of supersymmetric solutions which appears in the classification of supersymmetric solutions of minimal five - dimensional gauged supergravity constructed in @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the null killing vector which is obtained as a spinor bilinear is given by @xmath300 , in the co - ordinates of ( [ extmetric ] ) .",
    "the fact that this killing vector is null rather than timelike is related to an interesting feature which distinguishes these bps solutions from five - dimensional rotating bps black holes , namely the existence of an ergoregion , i.e. a region outside the horizon where it is not possible for observers to remain static .",
    "note that in the bps limit ( [ extlimit ] ) the limit of staticity is at @xmath301 which is outside the horizon at @xmath242 ( unless we switch off momentum , @xmath302 , and go to global ads ) .",
    "therefore the ergoregion persists in the bps limit .    for stationary bps black holes the killing vector obtained as a spinor bilinear is the standard static killing vector field @xmath259 , which is timelike at infinity . for rotating black holes @xmath259",
    "is different from the ` horizontal ' killing vector field @xmath303 , which becomes null on the horizon .",
    "an ergoregion exists when @xmath259 becomes space - like outside the horizon .",
    "however if @xmath259 is a bilinear formed out of killing spinors , supersymmetry implies that it must be either time - like or null .",
    "hence , rotating bps black holes can not have an ergoregion .",
    "moreover it can be shown that the event horizon of a rotating bps black hole must be non - rotating @xcite . as we have shown above , this is different for the extremal limit of an ads - schwarzschild black brane , which is a bps wave solution in ads@xmath0 : the ergoregion persists in the bps limit , and the ( degenerate limit of the ) horizon moves with the speed of light , since @xmath304 .",
    "this is consistent with the solution being bps , because the killing vector obtained as a killing spinor bilinear is not @xmath259 , which is timelike at asymptotic infinity and becomes spacelike before the horizon , but @xmath305 , which is null everywhere for the bps solution .",
    "moreover , the horizon turning into a purely left - moving wave is consistent with the familiar string theory description of a bps state as a state with massless excitations moving in one direction only .",
    "we turn to an investigation of the thermodynamics of the black brane solutions of section [ ssec : properties ] .",
    "the hawking temperature is related to the surface gravity by @xmath306 , where the surface gravity @xmath57 of a killing horizon is given by @xmath307 evaluating this for @xmath308 , we find the hawking temperature @xmath4 : @xmath309 we remark that the same result can be obtained by imposing that the euclidean continuation of the solution does not have a conical singularity at the horizon , see appendix [ app : euclideanisation ] .    in the zero boost limit @xmath261 , @xmath278",

    "since our solutions are not asymptotically flat , but rather asymptotic to ads@xmath0 , we can not apply the standard adm prescription to compute the mass and linear momentum of our branes .",
    "instead , we use the method based on the quasilocal stress tensor @xcite , see also @xcite for a review in the context of the fluid - gravity correspondence . here",
    "we simply present the result , and relegate explicit calculational details to appendix [ app : fluidgrav ] . to leading order in @xmath313",
    "we find that the quasilocal stress tensor takes the form @xmath314 where @xmath315 is the minkowski metric on @xmath316 which denotes the hypersurface @xmath317 of our space - time , with coordinates @xmath318 .",
    "as indicated we have omitted terms subleading in @xmath313 , since we are ultimately interested in expressions which are finite on the boundary @xmath319 of space - time .",
    "note that @xmath320 takes the form of the stress energy tensor of a perfect ultra - relativistic fluid ( equation of state @xmath321 , where @xmath188 is the energy density and @xmath322 is the pressure ) , with pressure proportional to @xmath323 .",
    "the proportionality between @xmath231 and @xmath4 is the same behaviour as for large ads - schwarzschild black holes . in the absence of a boost",
    ", it is known that ads - schwarzschild black branes behave thermodynamically like large ( rather than small ) ads - schwarzschild black holes @xcite .",
    "having obtained the quasilocal stress tensor , mass and linear momentum can be computed as conserved charges associated to the killing vectors of our solution .",
    "again , the details are relegated to the appendix [ app : fluidgrav ] .",
    "the mass , which is the conserved charge associated with time translation invariance , is @xmath324 where @xmath325 is the spatial volume of the brane , computed with the standard euclidean metric @xmath326 . due to the infinite extention of the brane ,",
    "the mass is infinite , and to obtain a finite quantity we must either compactify the world volume directions or define densities .",
    "we will do the latter by consistently splitting off a factor @xmath327 from all extensive quantities .",
    "next we calculate the momentum in the @xmath219-direction , which is the conserved charge associated to @xmath219-translation invariance .",
    "the result is @xmath328 and vanishes as expected in the zero boost limit @xmath278 , @xmath261 .",
    "notice that these charges satisfy @xmath329 , which resembles the motion of a non - relativistic body of mass @xmath17 , moving at velocity @xmath330 .",
    "finally , we calculate the bekenstein - hawking entropy of the solution by integrating the pull back of the metric over the horizon . recalling that we are working in units where @xmath331",
    ", we find @xmath332 where @xmath333 denotes the pullback of the metric to the surface @xmath334 .",
    "using these , we can check that the thermodynamic variables satisfy the first law : @xmath335 we remark that obtaining is a non - trivial consistency check for the correctness of the definition of the thermodynamical quantities , which are initially ambiguous because they require background subtractions corresponding to renormalization of the boundary cft @xcite , see also @xcite for a discussion in the context of rotating black holes in higher than four dimensions . as noted before we do not need to apply a background subtraction for the translation velocity @xmath273 , since the asymptotic ads@xmath0 background is not co - translating .",
    "this is different for ads - kerr - type black holes , where the subtraction of the background rotation velocity is crucial for obtaining the correct thermodynamic relations @xcite .",
    "we also note that @xmath336 which are all defined in a reparametrization invariant way , depend on the parameter @xmath231 , which is therefore a physical parameter , despite the fact that it could be absorbed into the coordinates in the line element ( [ 5dmetric4 ] ) .",
    "moreover , without the ability of varying this parameter , one could not obtain the temperature / entropy term in the first law .",
    "we refer to appendix [ mmcc ] for further details on this technical point .",
    "the extremal limit of these quantities can be reached by taking @xmath311 and @xmath337 with @xmath338 fixed . in this case",
    "we find that the entropy density @xmath339 vanishes in the extremal limit , @xmath340 as @xmath341 .",
    "therefore our solutions satisfy the strong version of the nernst law , and will be referred to as nernst branes .",
    "moreover , since in this case @xmath342 , we find @xmath343 , which is of course the saturation of the bps bound , as it must be given the results of section [ subsection : bps ] .",
    "as already remarked earlier , in the extremal limit the boost parameter @xmath199 controls the mass , and @xmath344 is the limit where the solution becomes globally ads@xmath0 .",
    "we can eliminate the quantities @xmath231 and @xmath345 in favour of the thermodynamical variables @xmath4 and @xmath273 via @xmath346 in terms of @xmath4 and @xmath273 the mass of the solution is given by @xmath347 hence , we see that the heat capacity @xmath348 is positive , and the solution is thermodynamically stable .",
    "this is as expected , at least in the absence of a boost , since it is well known that ads - schwarzschild black branes behave thermodynamically like large ads - schwarzschild black holes @xcite .",
    "as we see from , the introduction of a boost does not introduce thermodynamic instablility .    expressing the entropy in terms of @xmath349 we find @xmath350 note that turning off the boost @xmath278 , which corresponds to @xmath351 , we have @xmath6 , which is the scaling behaviour expected for an @xmath352 schwarzschild black brane",

    "the limit of high temperature ( equivalently small boost velocity ) is @xmath353 this corresponds to @xmath354 , and so we see from that @xmath6 .",
    "the limit of low temperature ( equivalently boost velocity approaching the speed of light ) is the extremal limit @xmath355 in this case , one can see that @xmath356 , and so the entropy scales like @xmath19 .",
    "this is the behaviour predicted for five - dimensional lifts of four - dimensional nernst branes @xcite .",
    "we will comment further on the thermodynamic properties of our solutions in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "one motivation of the present work is the singular behaviour of the four - dimensional nernst branes found in @xcite .",
    "we will show in section [ section:4d ] that the five - dimensional nernst branes found above are dimensional lifts of these four - dimensional nernst branes . to investigate the effect of dimensional lifting on such singularities",
    ", we now examine the behaviour of curvature invariants and tidal forces of the five - dimensional solutions . from both",
    "the gravitational point of view , and with respect to applications to gauge - gravity dualities , one would like the solutions to have neither naked singularities , nor null singularities ( singularities coinciding with a horizon ) , while the presence of singularities hidden behind horizons is acceptable . in practice , the presence of large curvature invariants or large tidal forces will also be problematic , given that the supergravity action we start with needs to be interpreted as an effective action .",
    "therefore large curvature invariants or tidal forces are indications that this effective description breaks down due to quantum or , assuming an embedding into string theory , stringy corrections .",
    "this might also limit the applicability of gauge - gravity dualities to only part of the solution , where the corrections remain sufficiently small .      for our five - dimensional metric",
    "we compute the kretschmann scalar and ricci scalar to be @xmath357 note that these only depend on the temperature @xmath358 and the curvature radius @xmath209 of the ads@xmath0 ground state .",
    "for the extremal solution ( @xmath359 ) both curvature invariants take constant values which agree with those for global @xmath352 : @xmath360 for the non - extremal solution the curvature invariants tend to the @xmath211 values asymptotically , but will blow up as @xmath361 . since this is behind the horizon , there are no naked or null singularities related to the curvature invariants of five - dimensional nernst branes .",
    "even if all scalar curvature invariants are finite , there might still be curvature singularities related to infinite tidal forces .",
    "such curvature singularities can be found by computing the components of the riemann tensor in a ` parallely - propogated - orthonormal - frame ' ( ppon ) associated with the geodesic motion of a freely - falling observer .",
    "following @xcite they are called pp singularities , in contrast to sp singularities , where a scalar curvature invariant becomes singular .",
    "while such singularities are often considered milder than those associated to curvature invariants , they are nevertheless genuine singularities and have drastic physical effects ( ` spaghettification ' ) on freely falling observers .    the details of this construction for the five - dimensional extremal solution",
    "are relegated to appendix  [ app:5dtidalforces ] .",
    "we only need to consider the extremal solution , since non - extremal solutions are manifestly analytic at the horizon @xmath362 . from table",
    "[ riemanntable ] in appendix  [ app:5dtidalforces ] we observe that the non - zero components of the riemann tensor in the ppon all have near horizon behaviour of the form @xmath363 with @xmath364 for all but one independent non - vanishing component .",
    "hence , as the observer approaches the horizon of the extremal brane ( @xmath361 ) these components will diverge , resulting in infalling observers being subject to infinite tidal forces .",
    "this is the same behaviour as observed in four dimensions @xcite , and seems to be the price for having zero entropy .",
    "it is an interesting question whether stringy or other corrections could lift this singularity , and if so , whether it is possible to maintain zero entropy .",
    "we now want to dimensionally reduce our five - dimensional nernst branes and compare the resulting four - dimensional spacetimes to those found in previous work  @xcite .",
    "let us therefore review the relevant features , emphasising the problems that we want to solve .",

    "observe that following the standard treatment of the kerr solution , we do not only continue time but also the ` boost parameter ' @xmath565 , which is analogous to the angular momentum parameter of the kerr solution in boyer - lindquist coordinates .",
    "the euclidean section of the boosted black brane in   is then @xmath566 we now explore the near horizon geometry by adapting a similar calculation used to examine the kerr - newman solution in @xcite . introducing the new radial variable @xmath567 by @xmath568 , the function @xmath229 has the expansion @xmath569 around the horizon . expanding up to order @xmath506 ,",
    "the metric takes the form @xmath570 where we have replaced the coordinates @xmath107 and @xmath219 by the new coordinates @xmath571 we remark that , in contradistinction to the kerr - newman solution discussed in @xcite , ( i ) the coordinate @xmath572 is linear rather than angular , i.e.  we do not need to impose an identification on it ; and ( ii ) the coordinate @xmath573 is well defined , since @xmath345 and @xmath162 are constant , so that @xmath574 is exact .",

    ", we follow the procedure of  @xcite and introduce the frame field @xmath587 where @xmath107 is the proper time of our observer or , equivalently , the affine parameter for the geodesic motion , and a dot denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath107 .",

    "this divergence tells us that this particular coordinate system is not valid beyond the horizon .",
    "however , for our current purposes , this is not a problem as we are only interested in tidal forces close to , but outside , the horizon . in order to write down @xmath590 , we still need to obtain @xmath592 . for this",
    "we use that @xmath597 for a timelike observer , which is equivalent to @xmath598 where we ve taken the negative root to represent a radially infalling observer and @xmath599 are the roots of @xmath600 .",

    "we can now substitute the above expressions for @xmath601 into   to obtain the following expression for the first frame field @xmath602 whilst the frame field @xmath590 correctly describes the parallel propagation , it is not correctly normalised . to form an orthonormal basis of frame fields we can apply gram - schmidt procedure to the set of linearly independent frame fields @xmath603 where @xmath604 .",

    "we could equally well pick the positive root and consider an outgoing geodesic but @xmath592 will become complex for large @xmath233 , meaning the geodesic encounters a turning point and is reflected back into the bulk .",
    "this is reminiscent of the situation in appendix  [ app:5dtidalforces ] and in fact , this inability of timelike geodesics to reach the boundary is an example of a property that hyperscaling - violating lifshitz spacetimes can inherit from their parent anti de - sitter spacetimes .",
    "all of this means that we need only focus on the ingoing observer and near horizon tidal forces .",
    "another similarity with appendix  [ app:5dtidalforces ] is the divergence of @xmath629 and @xmath592 as @xmath361 ; again this indicates the coordinates are only valid up the horizon which is absolutely fine for the analysis of tidal forces .",
    "next we align the frame field @xmath630 with the vector field @xmath631 responsible for generating the integral curve along which the observer is moving : @xmath632 the observer is moving in the @xmath633 directions and so there are two frame fields associated to this : @xmath630 and @xmath634 .",

    "we next use maple to find the components of the riemann tensor in a coordinate basis with lowered indices , @xmath641 , and then multiply by frame fields to obtain the local tidal forces felt by the observer as in .",

    "<S> we construct nernst brane solutions , that is black branes with zero entropy density in the extremal limit , of fi - gauged minimal five - dimensional supergravity coupled to an arbitrary number of vector multiplets . </S>",
    "<S> while the scalars take specific constant values and dynamically determine the value of the cosmological constant in terms of the fi - parameters , the metric takes the form of a boosted ads schwarzschild black brane . </S>",
    "<S> this metric can be brought to the carter - novotn - horsk form that has previously been observed to occur in certain limits of boosted d3-branes . by dimensional reduction to four dimensions </S>",
    "<S> we recover the four - dimensional nernst branes of arxiv:1501.07863 and show how the five - dimensional lift resolves all their uv singularities . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of the compactification circle , which expands both in the uv and in the ir , plays a crucial role . at asymptotic infinity , </S>",
    "<S> the curvature singularity of the four - dimensional metric and the run - away behaviour of the four - dimensional scalar combine in such a way that the lifted solution becomes asymptotic to ads@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the existence of a finite chemical potential in four dimensions is related to fact that the compactification circle has a finite minimal value . </S>",
    "<S> while it is not clear immediately how to embed our solutions into string theory , we argue that the same type of dictionary as proposed for boosted d3-branes should apply , although with a lower amount of supersymmetry .    </S>",
