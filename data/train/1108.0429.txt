    "understanding the nature and formation of cosmic dust is crucial to our understanding of the cosmos . over its 50-year history ,",
    "infrared ( ir ) astronomy has shown that dust contributes to the physical processes inherent in star formation and mass - loss from evolved stars , as well as to several interstellar processes such as gas heating and the formation of molecules ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , silicate grains dominate dust emission in many astrophysical environments .",
    "the `` amorphous '' @xmath2 m and @xmath3 m silicate spectral features have been observed in almost every direction and to almost any distance , but the precise nature of this silicate dust remains a mystery .",
    "here we present a laboratory investigation of amorphous silicates , the type of dust grains most frequently inferred to exist from observational data .",
    "the classic `` 10@xmath0 m '' silicate feature was first observed in the late sixties in the ir spectra of several m - type giants and red supergiants ( rsgs ; * ? ? ?",
    "shortly thereafter a 10@xmath0 m absorption feature was discovered in the interstellar medium ( ism ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since then , it has been found to be almost ubiquitous , occurring in many astrophysical environments including the solar system and extrasolar planetary systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , the circumstellar regions of both young stellar objects and evolved intermediate mass stars ( asymptotic giant branch ; agb stars , and planetary nebulae ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; many lines of sight through the interstellar medium in our own galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; and in nearby and distant galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "initially this feature was attributed to silicate minerals @xcite , based on mixtures of spectra of crystalline silicate species predicted to form by theoretical models @xcite . however , laboratory spectra of crystalline silicate minerals showed more structure within the feature than observed in the astronomical spectra ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "subsequent comparison with natural glasses ( obsidian and basaltic glass ; from e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and with artificially disordered silicates @xcite showed that `` amorphous '' silicate was a better candidate for the 10@xmath0 m feature than any individual crystalline silicate mineral . since then , it has been commonly assumed that description of silicate as disordered or `` amorphous '' is synonymous with glassy silicate . however , this is an oversimplification .",
    "the term `` glass '' has a specific definition , i.e. the solid has no long - range order beyond nearest - neighbor atoms .",
    "`` crystalline '' is often taken to mean single crystals , but it is possible to form poly - nanocrystalline agglomerates , with a continuum which essentially extends from a true glass to a single crystal grain .",
    "furthermore , natural and synthetic `` glasses '' often contain microlites in addition , one might expect agglomerated particles to be polymineralic , and possibly to contain both crystalline and glassy constituents . @xcite introduced the idea of `` chaotic silicate '' in which the level of disorder is even greater than for glass .",
    "a chaotic silicate does not have to be stoichiometric , can contain different compositional zones within a single grain , and may be porous , and therefore much lower density than a glass .",
    "this range of possible grain types is demonstrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : xtalc ] .    in astrophysical environments , whether a solid is glassy , crystalline or some combination of the two has implications for its formation , and subsequent processing , evolution and destruction , and thus it is important to have tools to distinguish between such grain types .",
    "for example , true glasses with no inclusions will not transform into crystals below their glass transition temperature ( @xmath4 ; see   [ silglass ] ) , whereas a glass already containing microlites can continue to crystallize at slightly lower temperatures . in the case of terrestrial obsidians , with 900k @xmath5 1000k , elemental diffusion profiles suggest that crystal growth can continue down to @xmath1700k ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "if poly - nano - crystalline grains can be distinguished spectroscopically in the lab from truly glassy grains , we can test for their presence in astrophysical environments .",
    "for instance @xcite showed that there is a difference between single crystal and polynanocrystalline silicon carbide ( sic ) , while @xcite showed that glassy sic looks different than various crystalline samples .",
    "these laboratory data were invoked to explain changes in sic grains formed as carbon stars evolve . for silicates ,",
    "laboratory data on poly - nano - crystalline samples are lacking .",
    "whether grains are glassy or poly - nano - crystalline is an indicator of whether grains form or are processed above @xmath4 . if the two forms can not be distinguished in laboratory spectra , then the `` amorphous '' nature of silicates in space would no longer necessarily imply a truly glassy structure , allowing the possibility of higher dust formation temperatures .",
    "many observations have shown that the 10@xmath0 m silicate feature varies from object to object and even within a single object both temporally ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and spatially ( e.g. in @xmath6 car , n. smith , pers .",
    "comm ) . within a single type of astrophysical object ,",
    "the feature shows huge variations in terms of its peak position , width and its ratio to the @xmath7 m feature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "variations in feature shape from star to star can not be explained in terms of optical depth or grain temperature effects .",
    "several interpretations of these observations have been suggested including : grain size effect ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; mg / fe ratio and ( mg+fe)/si ratio ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; inclusion of oxide grains ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; increasing crystallinity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; grain shape ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; and grain porosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , all models of these effects utilize laboratory spectra , and are only as reliable as the data that goes into them .",
    "the near ubiquity of `` amorphous '' silicate features and their variations in strength , width , peak position and the ratio of the 10@xmath0m/18@xmath0 m features potentially provide the diagnostic tools to understand the detailed mechanisms by which dust is formed , processed and destroyed .",
    "however , existing laboratory and synthetic spectra are not sufficiently well understood to achieve this goal .      since the discovery of the 10@xmath0 m feature",
    ", there have been many laboratory studies producing ir spectra and optical functions of various samples for comparison with and modeling of observational data .",
    "in addition , synthetic optical functions have been derived from observational spectra , often combined with laboratory mineral data , in order to match the observed features ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the first laboratory spectra used in astronomical silicate studies were of crystalline silicates and natural glasses ( obsidian and basaltic glass , which contain some microlites ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "various studies produced `` amorphous '' samples through chemical vapor deposition ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , smokes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ion - irradiation of crystalline samples ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , laser ablation of crystalline samples @xcite , and quenching melts to glass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , these techniques yield different results . for instance",
    "the peak positions , full width at half maxima ( fhwma ) and ratios of the strengths of the 10 and 18@xmath0 m features vary between datasets even though the materials investigated are ostenibly the same composition .",
    "spectra from samples with the same reported composition vary , which should not occur if the samples had the same structures , and if all spectra were obtained under optically thin conditions . a detailed comparison between existing and new laboratory data are given in ",
    "[ comparison ] .",
    "the sample preparation techniques vary widely and lead to a range of disordered structures .",
    "unfortunately we do not have sufficient information on the physical structure or chemical characteristics of previously studied samples to determine the effects quantitively , but a qualitative analysis presented here highlights the need to make such sample information available .",
    "the data used most commonly for modeling astronomical environments are synthetic optical functions such as ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter dl ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ohm ) .",
    "these data are favored over laboratory spectra because they have broad wavelength coverage , which is not true of individual laboratory datasets .",
    "however , these synthetic functions were produced using compilations of laboratory spectral data and astronomical observed dust opacities from which new optical functions were calculated .",
    "the derived optical functions were then modified specifically to match the astronomical observations .",
    "for instance , in the @xcite data , the 9.7@xmath0 m feature is entirely derived from observational opacities , while the nir - nuv section of their optical function uses laboratory data from crystalline olivine studies , and the fuv / x - ray region uses laboratory data for crystalline alumina ( al@xmath8o@xmath9 ) .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite blend laboratory and astronomical data and their optical functions will match some spectral features , and can be used for comparison of optical depths between different dusty environments .",
    "however , they do not represent real solids and thus can not be used to determine the true nature of dust in space , how it varies spatially or temporally , or why .",
    "the basic building block of silicates is the sio@xmath10 tetrahedron .",
    "these can be linked in a framework , with each oxygen shared between two tetrahedra ( e.g. sio@xmath8 minerals and feldspars ) , or they can be linked in chains ( e.g. pyroxenes such as diopside [ di ; camgsi@xmath8o@xmath11 , enstatite [ en;mgsio@xmath9 ] ) or they can be isolated tetrahedra ( e.g. the olivines series : forsterite [ fo ; mg@xmath8sio@xmath13 to fayalite [ fa ; fe@xmath8sio@xmath13 ) . in all cases , the non - shared oxygens ( known as non - bridging oxygens or nbos ) are charge - balanced by other cations ( e.g. mg@xmath14 , fe@xmath14 , ca@xmath14 , na@xmath15 , etc ) .",
    "the ca - mg - al silicates that are expected to form in circumstellar environments are dominantly of pyroxene and olivine composition .    within each mineral group",
    ", solid solution allows compositions to vary between end - members . in the case of similarly - sized cations",
    "the solution may be continuous e.g. , enstatite to ferrosilite ( fs ; fesio@xmath9 ) and the olivine series . given the availability of other cations , end - member pyroxenes rarely occur in terrestrial or meteoritic samples .",
    "where the substituting cation is a different size , solid solution is more limited , for example between enstatite and diopside . in such cases , solid solution becomes less extensive at lower temperatures , so that cooling may lead to `` exsolution '' of two different pyroxene compositions from an initially homogeneous high - temperature solid .",
    "minerals occur as crystals that possess long - range order , with very narrow distributions of bond angles and lengths .",
    "this leads both to anisotropy ( properties varying with crystal orientation ) and narrow spectral features .",
    "silicate glasses are the `` frozen '' structural equivalents of liquids , possessing short - range order ( so that local charge - balance is conserved for example ) but lacking the long - range order that gives rise to symmetry and anisotropy in crystals .",
    "glasses are therefore both isotropic and have broad spectral features .    the basic structural unit of silicate glasses and melts is the sio@xmath10 tetrahedron , as is the case in crystalline silicate minerals .",
    "oxygens linking tetrahedra are known as bridging oxygens ( bo ) , while non - bridging oxygens ( nbo ) are coordinated by metal cations , which are termed network - modifiers in this role .",
    "tetrahedral cations ( t ) include not only si@xmath16 , but also trivalent cations such as al@xmath17 and fe@xmath17 ; these must be charge - balanced by other cations ( usually alkalis or alkaline earths ; fig .",
    "[ cartoon ] ) .",
    "the degree of polymerization of a melt or glass can be summarized by the ratio of nbo / t , which can range from 0 ( fully polymerized , e.g. sio@xmath8 ) to 4 ( fully depolymerized , e.g. mg@xmath8sio@xmath18 ) . in general ,",
    "more polymerized melts are more viscous and have higher glass transition temperatures . on quenching a melt , its structure is `` frozen in '' at the glass transition if cooling is rapid enough to prevent crystallization .",
    "the glass transition is actually an interval , often approximated by the glass transition temperature ( @xmath4 ) which is usually taken to be the temperature at which the viscosity is 10@xmath19 pa.s ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "rapid cooling from a given temperature preserves the network present in the liquid at that particular temperature . because of this behavior , glasses of any given composition can have subtle differences in structure that depend on cooling rates .",
    "the temperature at which the glass has the same structure as the melt is called the fictive temperature ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "see @xcite for a comprehensive review of melt structure and properties .",
    "two issues whose importance will be discussed in the current work are the role of water and the oxidation state of iron . at low water contents ( less than about 1 wt.% total h@xmath8o )",
    ", water dissolves in silicate glasses almost exclusively as hydroxyl ( oh@xmath22 ) ions @xcite , and acts as a network modifier ( fig .  [ cartoon ] ) . compared to other modifier oxides such as na@xmath8o and mgo",
    ", water has a more dramatic effect in reducing melt viscosity and glass transition temperatures @xcite .",
    "iron can play the role of network modifier ( octahedral fe@xmath14 or fe@xmath17 ) or network - forming cation ( tetrahedral fe@xmath17 ) .",
    "consequently , the oxidation state of an iron - bearing glass or melt has a significant effect on its structure and properties .",
    "from the perspective of cosmic dust formation , the glass transition temperature is essentially the temperature above which a given composition should form as or convert to crystalline solids , whereas solids formed below this temperature will be glassy if they cool sufficiently rapidly @xcite .",
    "more depolymerized melts are more difficult to quench , and melts less polymerized than pyroxenes ( nbo / t @xmath23 2 ) typically require extreme quench rates ( 100s ks@xmath24 ) using methods such as containerless laser processing to achieve truly glassy samples @xcite . for a given composition ,",
    "faster cooling rates result in a higher t@xmath25 .",
    "this dependence can be determined by differential scanning calorimetry using different heating and cooling rates , and is used to determine the cooling rate of natural lava samples @xcite .    for depolymerized silicates ( e.g. olivines and pyroxenes ) , if glassy grains form they must do so below their @xmath4 because the cooling rate required for quenching to a glass is extremely rapid .",
    "highly polymerized silicates ( e.g. silica , obsidian ) can be cooled more slowly , over hours or days , and not crystallize @xcite .",
    "however , the cooling timescales ( months ) determined by @xcite for agb star circumstellar shells are sufficiently long as to preclude the preservation of glassy / chaotic solids that form above @xmath4 , because annealing timescales are shorter than those for cooling for all but the most polymerized silicates .",
    "modeling of silicate dust in space has been limited by the available laboratory data the influence of various model parameters was investigated by @xcite , who found that using so - called `` clean '' ( i.e. pure magnesium ) silicate grains to model the observed 9.7@xmath0 m features did not yield a good fit due to the lack of absorption by these grains in the visible and near - ir .",
    "they also found that just mixing in more absorbing grains did not solve the problem .",
    "this led to the suggestion that the grains responsible for the 9.7@xmath0 m feature are `` dirty '' silicates , i.e. mg - silicates with impurities introduced into the matrix giving more opacity in the optical and near - ir .",
    "it is known that nbo / t ( polymerization ) affects the spectra of amorphous silicates such that the peak position of the 10@xmath0 m feature shifts redwards as nbo / t increases ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "aluminium ( al ) is a network former and consequently al content strongly affects nbo / t .",
    "@xcite suggested that al may be an important component of silicates in space that could explain why previous laboratory spectroscopic studies failed to match observational data .",
    "other cations may be equally important .",
    "ca@xmath14 and fe@xmath14 both substitute for mg , while fe@xmath17 will substitute for tetrahedral site ( e.g. si@xmath26 or al@xmath17 ) .",
    "therefore , the oxidation state is another important variable in addition to elemental substitutions .",
    "existing laboratory spectral data for `` amorphous '' silicates were produced using samples that are not sufficiently well - characterized to allow astronomers to interpret their observations without ambiguity .",
    "here we present new laboratory spectra of several silicate glasses of astronomical relevance , and discuss compositional factors that influence their spectral features .",
    "we compare these new data with those previously available for `` amorphous '' silicates and discuss how these samples compare to successfully - applied synthetic optical functions .",
    "we find that the synthetic spectra can not be well matched by the conventionally assumed glassy silicate composition and discuss whether astrophysical silicates need to be truly glassy .",
    "the bulk composition of silicate stardust lies somewhere between pyroxene ( m@xmath8si@xmath8o@xmath27 ) and olivine ( m@xmath8sio@xmath18 ) , where m indicates metal cations , with mg and fe being the most abundant .",
    "the cosmic mg / si ratio is predicted to be @xmath11.02 , while fe / si @xmath10.84 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , most fe is expected to combine with s , ni , cr , mn and other siderophile elements into metallic grains @xcite .",
    "this partitioning is reflected in the earth , where most iron resides in the metallic core while the mantle is dominated by magnesium - rich silicate with mg / fe @xmath19 .",
    "the predicted bulk cosmic silicate would then be close to mgsio@xmath9 , with minor amounts of iron leading to an atomic ( mg+fe)/si ratio slightly greater than 1 .",
    "determining the spectra of various olivine and pyroxene glasses is therefore of critical importance for identifying the silicate mineralogy .",
    "the focus of this study is glass compositions for which data already exist in the astronomy literature i.e. predominantly olivines and pyroxenes ( see table  [ litdata ] and references therein ) .",
    "mg - rich endmembers are forsterite and enstatite , respectively .",
    "another mineral that is commonly discussed in astromineralogy is diopside , which is also a pyroxene .",
    "diopside has been invoked to explain observed crystalline silicate features ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and appears in the classic condensation sequence for dust formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* see fig .",
    "[ condseqfig ] ) . furthermore , aluminous diopside formed in the experimental condensation study by @xcite , and @xcite showed that crystalline diopside grains can easily be amorphized by heavy ion irradiation .    to complement the olivines and pyroxenes ( table  [ litdata ] ) we include four samples from the melilite series , whose endmembers are gehlenite ( ge ; ca@xmath8al@xmath8sio@xmath28 ) and kermanite ( k ; ca@xmath8mgsi@xmath8o@xmath28 ) .",
    "gehlenite is predicted to be among the first - formed silicate grains ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see figure  [ condseqfig ] ) , and the major repository for calcium and aluminum in dust , whereas pyroxenes are predicted to be among the most abundant grains , and the major repository for mg and si ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore aluminium and calcium are highly depleted from the gas phase and are assumed to be included in dust @xcite .",
    "aluminum - rich silicates like gehlenite and other melilites are major constituents of calcium - aluminum - rich inclusions ( cais ) and gehlenite has been identified in red supergiants @xcite and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) environments @xcite and in meteorites @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a recent type ib supernova ( sn2005e ) has been shown to contain more calcium than expected @xcite . indeed almost 50% of its ejecta mass ( or @xmath230.1m@xmath29 ) is attributed to calcium .",
    "@xcite reported laboratory spectra of crystalline melilites every 10% along the solid - solution join between kermanite and gehlenite .",
    "@xcite reported laboratory spectra of two glasses : end - member gehlenite , and k50-ge50 .",
    "given that the cosmic mg / ca ratio is @xmath116 , it seems likely that melilites could have substantial kermanite contents .",
    "the difference in the structure of the glasses is profound : nbo / t is 0.67 for gehlenite and 3.0 for kermanite , while al / si is 2 for gehlenite and 0 for kermanite .",
    "both theoretical models @xcite and observations @xcite suggest that some iron is incorporated into silicates .",
    "@xcite presented spectra for two silicate glasses containing the most abundant dust forming elements ( i.e. mg , si , fe , ca , al , na ) . however , iron in their sample was partially oxidized ( feo / fe@xmath8o@xmath301 ) which leads to problems in interpreting the spectrum ( see   [ silglass ] ) . with this in mind",
    "we present a sample we call `` basalt '' ( @xmath31 ) , which contains ferrous iron ( fe@xmath14 ) . while iron has been invoked to explain opacity problems , most iron is expected to combine with other siderophile elements to form metal or metal sulfide grains rather than silicate @xcite .",
    "consequently , we have synthesized an iron - free silicate glass using cosmic abundance ratios for mg , si , al , ca , and na , yielding @xmath32 .",
    "this sample does not include volatile elements or iron and is quite close to enstatite in composition .",
    "this `` cosmic silicate '' is designed to test the @xcite hypothesis that dust forms as chaotic solids with the elemental abundances of the gas .",
    "@xcite provided spectra of obsidian , a naturally occurring glassy silicate . consequently we include obsidian glass in our sample , in part because this is the origin of the attribution of the @xmath110@xmath0 m feature to amorphous silicates .",
    "it is also useful for studying the effect of silicate structure and composition on spectral parameters because it is different from the more commonly assumed olivines and pyroxenes .",
    "finally , we include silica ( sio@xmath8 ) glass in our sample .",
    "like obsidian , the structure of sio@xmath8 is significantly different from olivines and pyroxenes and thus provides potential insight into the effects of structure on silicate spectral features .",
    "furthermore , silica dust grains have been invoked to explain observed astronomical spectral features in both evolved stars @xcite and in young stellar objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the samples investigated here are listed in table  [ tab : samples ] .",
    "samples designated with `` synthetic '' in their name are generated from mixtures of reagent - grade oxides and carbonates , providing glasses with compositions like those of end - member minerals .",
    "the `` cosmic '' silicate was also synthesized in this way .",
    "in contrast , samples designated as `` remelt '' were generated by melting natural mineral samples .",
    "consequently the `` remelt''-samples have compositions whose additional components reflect the impurities found in natural crystalline samples of the relevant minerals .",
    "using both synthetic and remelted samples helps to demonstrate the effect and importance of small compositional variations in silicates .",
    "synthesis of silicate glasses from oxide and carbonate starting materials , was undertaken at the mu experimental petrology facility and the procedures are described in detail by @xcite .",

    "glasses in the pyroxene series ( including `` cosmic '' compositions ) vary in their quenchability ; diopside ( camgsi@xmath8o@xmath27 ) is an excellent glass - former , while enstatite ( mgsio@xmath9 ) crystallizes extremely rapidly .",

    ", one may expect either a single crystal of enstatite or a mono - mineralic polycrystalline agglommeration ( if crystallization starts at more than one point in the grain . ) however , since glassy grains are expected to form to include all the atoms in the outflowing gas , fractional crystallization is possible . for instance , our `` cosmic '' silicate has a bulk composition close to enstatite , but contains a significant amount of other elements .",

    "<S> we present a laboratory study of silicate glasses of astrophysically relevant compositions including olivines , pyroxenes and melilites . with emphasis on the classic si  o stretching feature near 10@xmath0 m , we compare infrared spectra of our new samples with laboratory spectra on ostensibly similar compositions , and also with synthetic silicate spectral data commonly used in dust modeling . </S>",
    "<S> several different factors affect spectral features including sample chemistry ( e.g. , polymerization , mg / fe ratio , oxidation state and al - content ) and different sample preparation techniques lead to variations in porosity , density and water content . </S>",
    "<S> the convolution of chemical and physical effects makes it difficult to attribute changes in spectral parameters to any given variable . </S>",
    "<S> it is important that detailed chemical and structural characterization be provided along with laboratory spectra . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to composition and density , we measured the glass transition temperatures for the samples which place upper limits on the formation / processing temperatures of these solids in space .    </S>",
    "<S> popular synthetically - generated optical functions do not have spectral features that match any of our glass samples </S>",
    "<S> . however , the @xmath110@xmath0 m feature generated by the synthetic data rarely exactly matches the shape and peak position of astronomically observed silicate features . our comparison with the synthetic spectra allows astronomers to determine likely candidates amongst our glass samples for matching astronomical observations . </S>"
