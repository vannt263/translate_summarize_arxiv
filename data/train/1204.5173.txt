    "general relativity ( gr ) passes all present tests with flying colours , however , there are several reasons why it remains very important to consider alternative theories of gravity .",
    "the first one is that theoretical attempts at quantizing gravity or unifying it with other interactions generically predict deviation from einstein s theory , because gravitation is no longer mediated by a pure spin-2 field but also by partners to the graviton .",
    "the second reason is that it is any way extremely instructive to contrast gr s predictions with those of alternative models , even if there were no serious theoretical motivation for them .",
    "the third reason is the existence of several puzzling experimental issues , which do not contradict gr in a direct way , but may nevertheless suggest that gravity does not behave at large distances exactly as newton and einstein predicted .",
    "cosmological observations notably tell us that about @xmath1 of the total energy density of the universe is composed of unknown , non - baryonic , fluids ( @xmath2 of `` dark energy '' and @xmath3 of `` dark matter '' ) , and the acceleration of the two pioneer spacecrafts towards the sun happens to be larger than what is expected from the @xmath4 law . therefore , alternative theories are any way important to study . + since the observed universe is almost homogeneous and isotropic , space - time is usually described by a friedman - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) cosmology . but",
    "it is also believed that in the early universe the flrw model does not give a correct matter description .",
    "the anomalies found in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and the large structure observations stimulated a growing interest in anisotropic cosmological model of the universe .",
    "observations by the differential macrowave radiometers ( dmr ) on nasa s cosmic background explorer spacecraft registered anisotropy in various angle scales .",
    "it is conjectured , that these anisotropies hide in their hearts the entire history of the cosmic evolution down to recombination , and they are considered to be indicative of the universe geometry and the matter composing the universe .",
    "it is expected , that much more will be known about anisotropy of cosmic microwave s background after the investigations of the microwave s anisotropy probe .",
    "there is a general agreement among cosmologists that cosmic microwave s background anisotropy in the small angle scale holds the key to the formation of the discrete structure .",
    "the theoretical argument @xcite and the modern experimental data support the existence of an anisotropic phase , which turns into an isotropic one .",
    "+ in recent years , there has been considerable interest in scalar tensor theories of gravitation which are considered to be essential to describe the gravitational interaction near the planks scale , string theory , extended inflation and many higher order theories imply scalar field .",
    "scalar - tensor theories of gravitation provide the natural generalizations of general relativity and also provide a convenient set of representations for the observational limits on possible deviations from general relativity .",
    "there are two categories of gravitational theories involving a classical scalar field @xmath5 . in first category",
    "the scalar field @xmath5 has the dimension of the inverse of the gravitational constant @xmath6 among which the brans - decke theory @xcite is of considerable importance and the role of the scalar field is confined to its effect on gravitational field equations .",

    "so the solutions presented in this paper are new and different from other author s solutions",
    ". + finally , our solutions may be useful for better understanding of the evolution of the universe in bianchi - i space - time within the framework of s@xmath0ez - ballester scalar - tensor theory of gravitation .",
    "the solutions presented here can be one of the potential candidates to describe the observed universe .",
