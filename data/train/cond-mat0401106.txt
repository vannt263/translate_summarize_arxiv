    "quantum computation in its binary concept requires a set of two different quantum states , a _ quantum two - level system _ ( qu2ls ) , that realizes the quantum bit physically @xcite .",
    "some physical systems are intrinsically qu2lss such as the spin @xmath1 of a fermion or the polarization of a photon .",
    "spin @xmath1 systems such as some nuclei of atoms or electrons are considered well - suited also because of the comparatively long spin decoherence times ( @xmath2 to @xmath3 ) levy01,gordon58,kikkawa97 which derives from the rather weak interaction of the spin with its environment .",
    "this long coherence also has the price that important processes in qubit operation are rather slow processes . on the other hand ,",
    "decoherence times for charge based quantum systems are orders of magnitude shorter ( @xmath4 ) due to the comparatively strong coulomb interaction @xcite .",
    "yet , all quantum gates including interacting qubits can be expected to scale similarly in time and to allow for fast qubit operations well below the decoherence limits .",
    "furthermore , final readout through single - electron transistors ( set ) or quantum point contacts ( qpc ) appears to be  straightforward \" ( i.e. , implementable in principle ) @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we discuss quantum bits ( qubits ) encoded in the spatial wave function of electrons embedded in condensed matter systems , and the emphasis is placed on whether it is possible to realize a qubit based solely on charge distribution ( _ charge qubit _ ) and capacitive coupling .",
    "for example , having a set of two quantum dots ( qudots ) close enough so that one electron can tunnel back and forth , one may envisage a qubit where the electron being on one quantum dot ( qudot ) represents one state , and being on another qudot the other state @xcite .",
    "other examples are the cellular automata setups with a @xmath5 array of qudots with excess electrons @xcite . these proposals are fundamentally based on the variability of the tunneling @xmath6 .",
    "yet there are many physical quantum systems where the handle on the tunneling is limited or non - existent , such as the case of metallic qudot structures where the tunneling barrier is determined by the thickness of oxide layers in the structure .",
    "this then suggests the question of whether there is a way that electrostatically controlled logical quantum gates ( qugates ) can realize the necessary single qubit operations and the tunability of interactions between them . in this context , it is important to clearly define what one means by a quantum bit encoded in a quantum two - level system ( qu2ls ) and what are the requirements for it .",
    "the following criteria are established for the usefulness of a qu2ls @xcite :    1 .",
    "[ qubit_criteria_1 ] the qu2ls should include the ground state of the system in the _ working - range _ of the ( tunable ) parameters ; this clearly facilitates the initialization process in an experiment and is much more reliable when compared to a qu2ls completely built on excited states .",
    "[ qubit_criteria_2 ] the qu2ls should be well separated in energy from the remaining states in the hilbert space .",
    "this reduces the influence of the remaining hilbert space , whose interference can be insofar interpreted as a source of _ decoherence _ and transitions to which may result in loss of probability in the primary system .",
    "lossy channel _ for the qu2ls is considered in more detail below .",
    "[ qubit_criteria_3 ] the qu2ls must interact with a set of external gates in order to control single qubit states as well as the interaction between them without compromising the two - level system .    in the case of charge located on a set of well - defined quantum dots ( a _ qudot network _ ) , the electrostatic interaction is clearly able to satisfy point ( [ qubit_criteria_3 ] ) where coulomb blockade ( or charging ) effects introduce a high energy scale ( @xmath7 ) in typical qudots .",
    "these structures localize the operating electrons and limit the unwanted fast decoherence times due to interaction with the surrounding condensed matter environment .",
    "typical decoherence sources such as phonons or unstable impurities in the environment are regarded frozen out or static , respectively , at the low temperatures required for operation of the qubit system . consequently , the primary source of decoherence in this regime is in fact the reservoir of high - lying states , and its coherent interference with the qu2ls will be consider explicitly in our description .",
    "the effect of the controlling electrostatic gates on the _ reservoir _ of high - lying states must be in the adiabatic regime .",
    "the time dependent manipulation through gate action can be estimated in the following manner : the gates are considered to act in clearly specified time windows in a step like behavior : they are turned on and off at will .",
    "this switching , however , is always carried out with a maximum speed which introduces a characteristic frequency @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the switching time itself . in order for the influence of the reservoir of higher lying states to be negligible",
    ", @xmath10 must be much smaller than the energy difference to the closest coupled states in that bath ; thus the switching must be done smoothly enough ( adiabatically ) , so as to not admix higher states into the lower qubit states .",
    "coherent quantum operation in the qu2ls , however , demands the switching to be done faster than @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the splitting of the qu2ls in question , and incorporated in criterion ( [ qubit_criteria_2 ] ) .    with respect to criteria",
    "( [ qubit_criteria_2 ] ) and ( [ qubit_criteria_3 ] ) , an estimate of how much of the wave function may be lost for each gate operation can be obtained from the feshbach formalism @xcite . for",
    "the unperturbed low - energy state manifold @xmath13 ( in contrast to the remainder of the space @xmath14 ) , an initial state @xmath15 fully contained in @xmath13 will acquire projections in @xmath14 due to a gate operation @xmath16 ( assumed instantaneous ) , given by @xmath17where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is a projection of the hamiltonian , and with the other projections defined similarly ( see eq .",
    "( [ h_pq_rep ] ) below ) .",
    "space @xmath14 is considered to be at least an energy @xmath20 separated from space @xmath13 and the change in the matrix elements due to the gate operation @xmath16 is approximated by the splitting @xmath12 induced by that very @xmath16 in the ground state pair in @xmath13 ; with this , the equation above can be estimated as @xmath21the gate operations considered are a sequence of steps in the external parameters , which implies that with every one of these steps a small probability fraction is lost from the ground qu2ls to the remaining higher lying states , and as such it can be considered as an additional channel for decoherence , even if the projection is nearly reversible in a gate cycle . moreover , if the ground state can be considered sufficiently isolated ( @xmath22 ) , the error drops quadratically with the ratio @xmath23 , so that if @xmath24 , the probability lost per gate operation would be smaller than @xmath25 . however , because the gate operations will never be performed instantaneously  smoothing the transitions so that they take longer than @xmath26 but are faster than @xmath27  this is clearly to reduce the probability loss to the ` @xmath14 reservoir ' of excited states .    thus with proper adiabatic design of the qugates with respect to the higher lying ` reservoir ' , the way to single qubit operations is open .",
    "however , how exactly these are realized still leaves plenty of possibilities , which one can imagine being flexible enough . here the main emphasis is placed on capacitively coupled quantum gates and the question of whether they allow the necessary single qubit operations .",

    "is taken large enough to illustrate the main physics .",

    "is considered to have , for simplicity , a fixed number of two electrons ( @xmath47 ) operating in it .",
    "furthermore , since spin flip processes occur on a comparatively long time scale @xcite , they are neglected and thus the overall spin is considered constant . the correct statistics for exchange of the two electrons is taken into account by the fermionic creation ( annihilation ) operators @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) .",

    "[ stmt_nodeless_gs ] the ground state of any state ( single particle , singlet or triplet ) for a real ( not complex ) hamiltonian must be nodeless , where for the states with more than one particle one must consider the restricted space @xmath99 only within some unique sorting scheme , where @xmath100 points to the location of particle @xmath101 ( this restriction is necessary since for example on the overall space , the triplet states have an intrinsic node due to the particle exchange symmetry ) .",

    "statement ( [ stmt_node_in_psi2 ] ) is shown as follows : since @xmath109 with the local potential @xmath110 there must some region in space where both @xmath111 and @xmath112 are @xmath113 simultaneously . yet , since @xmath114 and @xmath112 are orthogonal eigenfunctions , in order for @xmath115to be @xmath116 there must be still another region in space with both @xmath114 and @xmath112 unequal to zero but with a different sign compared to the first region .",
    "thus either @xmath114 or @xmath112 must switch sign from one region to the other .    with this , statement ( [ stmt_qustate_separation ] ) follows from the observation that for some specific set of parameters ( within the working - range of the qubit ) the ground state is degenerate ; thus utilizing statement ( [ stmt_nodeless_gs ] ) , both of these ground states must be nodeless .",

    "the argument of a nodeless ground state wave function very much relies on that fact since for a real wave function a sign change is only possible via a transition through zero while in the complex case this is no longer required . with this , statement ( [ stmt_qustate_separation ] ) becomes irrelevant , and the freedom on @xmath137 @xmath113 is greatly increased . specifically , an external magnetic field which makes the hamiltonian complex , will in fact not increase the initially existent ( but constant ! ) @xmath66 qugate for singlet states , but it can reduce it to zero . eventually , this is again equivalent to an effectively tunable tunneling @xcite .",
    "the use of spatial wave functions to encode quantum bits has been analyzed with respect to capacitive electrostatic interactions . with emphasis on systems such as lithographically grown arrays where the tunneling is fixed to a great extent by the thickness of the tunnel barriers ( oxide layers ) used , it was shown that with constant tunneling @xmath6 and no external magnetic field present , the single qubit operations from a system built this way are severely limited .",
    "the analysis shows that a full set of single qubit operations requires either a tunable tunneling or an external magnetic field which makes the wave function complex and thus introduces further flexibility .",
