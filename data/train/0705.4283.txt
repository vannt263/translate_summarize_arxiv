    "in the current paradigm of structure formation , dark matter ( dm ) halos build up in a hierarchical fashion through the dissipationless mechanism of gravitationally instability .",
    "the assembly of the stellar content of galaxies is instead governed by much more complicated physical processes , often dissipative and non - linear , which are generally poorly understood . to counter this lack of understanding ,",
    "prescriptions are employed in the galaxy formation models .",
    "one of the fundamental tools for constraining the physical processes encoded in these models is the luminosity function ( lf ) , since its shape retains the imprint of galaxy formation and evolution processes .",
    "the faint end of the lf can be matched with a combination of supernova feedback and the suppression of gas cooling in low - mass halos due to a background of photoionizing radiation ( e.g. , @xcite ) . matching the bright end of the lf",
    "has proven more challenging .",
    "very recent implementation of active galactic nucleus ( agn ) feedback in semianalytic models ( sams ) has yielded exceptionally faithful reproductions of the observed local rest - frame @xmath6- and @xmath7-band global lfs ( @xcite ; @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , including good matches to the local rest - frame @xmath6-band lfs of red and blue galaxies ( although with some discrepancies for faint red galaxies ; @xcite ) .",
    "the excellent agreement between observations and models at @xmath8 is impressive but is partly due to the fact that the model parameters were adjusted to obtain the best match to the local universe .",
    "a key question is therefore how well these models predict the lf at earlier times .",
    "the sams of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have been compared to observations at @xmath9 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although the agreement is generally good , @xcite infer that the abundance of galaxies near the knee of the lf at high redshift is larger in the sams than in the observations ( except possibly for the brightest objects ) , in an apparent reversal of previous studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , the rest - frame optical lf has been accurately measured in the redshift range @xmath1 , using a combination of the @xmath7-selected musyc , goods , and fires surveys @xcite . in this letter",
    "we compare the observed lf to that predicted by theoretical models in this redshift range , in order to test the predictive power of the latest generation of galaxy formation models .",
    "we also compare the observed lf to predictions from smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations , which have so far only been compared to data at @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "we note that these comparisons are effectively the rest - frame equivalent of the test proposed by @xcite .",
    "we assume @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13  km  s@xmath14  mpc@xmath14 .",
    "all magnitudes are in the ab system , while colors are on the vega system .",
    "the observed rest - frame optical lfs at @xmath15 have been taken from @xcite . briefly , they presented the galaxy lfs in the rest - frame @xmath6-band ( at @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) , @xmath0-band ( at @xmath18 ) , and @xmath19-band ( at @xmath20 ) , measured from a @xmath7-selected sample constructed from the multiwavelength survey by yale - chile ( musyc ; @xcite ) , the ultradeep faint infrared extragalactic survey ( fires ; @xcite ) , and the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ; @xcite ; chandra deep field  south ) . this @xmath7-selected sample , comprising a total of @xmath21990 galaxies with @xmath22 at @xmath23 , is unique for its combination of surveyed area ( @xmath21380  arcmin@xmath24 ) and large range of luminosities .",
    "in this letter we limit our comparison between observed and predicted lfs to the rest - frame @xmath0 band , at the two redshift intervals @xmath25 ( directly taken from @xcite ) and @xmath26 ( derived in the same way as described in @xcite ) .",
    "the results are qualitatively similar for other rest - frame bands .",
    "the @xcite sam is implemented on the millennium dm simulation described in @xcite .",
    "the details of the assumed prescriptions and the specific parameter choices are described in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we have also used the outputs from the sam of @xcite as updated by @xcite .",
    "this model differs from the sam of @xcite in many ways .",
    "the scheme for building the merger trees is different in detail , as are many of the prescriptions adopted to model the baryonic physics , most notably those associated with the growth of and the feedback from smbhs in galaxy nuclei and the cooling model ( see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite for details ) .",
    "finally , we have compared the observed lfs with the predictions from the cosmological sph simulations of @xcite , already used in @xcite to constrain the physical properties of @xmath27 galaxies .",
    "the key ingredient of these simulations is the inclusion of superwind feedback , critical to avoid the overprediction by the simulations of the observed global star formation rate by reducing the reservoir of gas available for star formation @xcite .",
    "specifically , we used the `` momentum - driven wind '' model used in finlator et al .",
    "( 2007 , namely , their `` jvzw '' model ; see also @xcite for detailed descriptions ) .",
    "we have used the 32  h@xmath14  mpc box simulation , combined with a 64  h@xmath14  mpc box to better sample the bright end of the lf .",
    "we note that the key difference between the agn feedback implementation in the sams and the superwind feedback is that the former does not require star formation .",
    "computing the sam - predicted rest - frame @xmath0-band lfs is straightforward , as the catalog is complete in the luminosity range of interest and has no redshift errors .",
    "we also extracted rest - frame colors of the galaxies in order to determine the lf for red and blue galaxies separately .",
    "the comparison between the observed rest - frame @xmath0-band lfs of all galaxies at @xmath18 and @xmath17 with those predicted by the theoretical models is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "it is immediately obvious that the models do not yet provide a precise description of galaxy evolution .",
    "differences between the various models , and discrepancies between model predictions and data , are still as large as a factor of @xmath28 for certain luminosity and redshift ranges .    at @xmath18 ,",
    "the global lf predicted by the sam of @xcite agrees well with the observed lf , although the sam slightly underpredicts the density of galaxies around the knee of the lf .",
    "however , while at @xmath17 the shape of the observed lf is broadly reproduced by the sam , the predicted characteristic density @xmath29 is @xmath212.5 times larger than the observed value .",
    "the sam of @xcite has difficulty with both the normalization and the slope of the lf , which is too steep . at @xmath18 ,",
    "the de lucia model matches the faint end but underpredicts ( by a factor of @xmath2124 ) the bright end . at @xmath17 , instead , the predicted lf matches the bright end but overpredicts the faint end by a factor of @xmath30 .",
    "the sph simulations of @xcite predict lfs that are qualitatively similar to those predicted by the two sams , although the former are characterized by larger uncertainties , due to the much smaller simulated volume .",
    "we quantified these results by determining the luminosity density @xmath31 ( obtained by integrating the lf ) for the observations and models .",
    "the luminosity density is a more robust measure than @xmath32 , @xmath29 , and the faint - end slope @xmath33 , because the errors in these parameters are highly correlated .",
    "the observed @xmath31 ( @xmath34 ) has been estimated by integrating the best - fit schechter function down to @xmath35 , which is the faintest luminosity probed by the @xmath7-selected sample error on @xmath31 was calculated by deriving the distribution of all the values of @xmath36 within the 3  @xmath37 solutions of the schechter lf parameters from the maximum - likelihood analysis , including in quadrature a 10% contribution from photometric redshift uncertainties .",
    "using a brighter integration limit of the lf ( @xmath38 ) does not change the results of the comparison significantly . ] . to estimate @xmath31 from the sam ( @xmath39 ) ,",
    "we have fitted the predicted lfs with a schechter function , leaving @xmath32 , @xmath29 , and @xmath33 as free parameters , applying the same limits as to the data .",
    "the comparison between @xmath34 and @xmath39 of @xcite is shown in figure  [ fig2 ] ( _ bottom panels _ ) by the black lines and data points .",
    "the bower sam matches the observed luminosity density at @xmath5 .",
    "however , the model does not match the evolution of @xmath31 . in the model",
    "the luminosity increases with cosmic time , by a factor of @xmath40 from @xmath3 to @xmath41 .",
    "by contrast , the observed luminosity density _ decreases _ with time , by a factor of @xmath42 over the same redshift range .",
    "results for the de lucia sam are similar , but for this model the difference between observed and predicted density is a strong function of the adopted faint - end integration limit .",
    "we investigated the cause of the discrepancies by splitting the sample into blue and red galaxies , using their rest - frame colors . here",
    "we focus on the bower model , as it provides the best match to the shape of the global lf , and a wide range of rest - frame colors are available .",
    "interestingly , the results depend strongly on the choice of color : splitting the sample by @xmath43 color ( as done in @xcite ) produces very different results than splitting by @xmath44 color .    to define red galaxies",
    ", we first use the criterion @xmath450.25 , as done in @xcite .",
    "as shown in the bottom left panel of figure  [ fig2 ] , the bower model reproduces the densities of red and blue galaxies at @xmath5 extremely well .",
    "the model overpredicts the densities of red and blue galaxies at @xmath46 , although it predicts the correct ratio between the two ( roughly 1:1 ) .",
    "next , we use the criterion @xmath470.5 .",
    "roughly corresponds to @xmath48 . ]",
    "as can be seen in the top panels of figure  [ fig2 ] , this criterion leads to very similar observed densities of red and blue galaxies as the @xmath43 criterion .",
    "however , the predicted densities are in severe disagreement with the observations , particularly at @xmath5 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , _ bottom right panel _ ) . the red galaxy density at @xmath5 underpredicts the observed density by a factor of @xmath49 .",
    "qualitatively similar results are obtained when @xmath39 from the sam of @xcite is used in the comparison .",
    "colors , but no @xmath43 colors . ]",
    "irrespective of the color criterion that is used , we find that the predicted _ evolution _ of the red and blue luminosity densities is in qualitative disagreement with the observed evolution . in the observations , the moderate evolution of the luminosity density is mainly driven by a decrease with cosmic time of the density of blue galaxies , with the red galaxies evolving much less ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "by contrast , in the sams , the moderate evolution seen in the global lf is in the opposite sense and dominated by a strong evolution in the red galaxy population .",
    "the main results of our comparison between the observed and the model - predicted rest - frame @xmath0-band lfs of galaxies at @xmath50 are ( 1 ) the sam of @xcite reproduces well the observed lf at @xmath5 ; ( 2 ) the models predict an increase with time of the rest - frame @xmath0-band luminosity density , whereas the observations show a decrease ; ( 3 ) the models predict strong evolution in the red galaxy population , whereas in the observations most of the evolution is in the blue population ; ( 4 ) the models greatly underpredict the abundance of galaxies with @xmath51 at @xmath5 .",
    "the different results obtained for @xmath43 and @xmath44 colors are interesting , as they may hint at possible ways to improve the models .",
    "we further investigate the disagreement between observed and predicted colors in the sam of @xcite in figure  [ fig3 ] , which shows the comparison of observations and predictions in the @xmath44 versus @xmath52 diagram . while the sam seems to broadly reproduce the observed @xmath52 distribution",
    ", it predicts galaxies that are systematically bluer in @xmath44 than the observed galaxies .",
    "we have plotted evolutionary tracks of stellar population synthesis models constructed with the @xcite code , assuming three different prescriptions for the star formation history ( sfh ) : a constant sfh ( csf ) , an exponentially declining in time sfh characterized by the parameter @xmath53  myr ( @xmath54300 ) , and an instantaneous burst model ( ssp ) .",
    "we selected the `` padova 1994 '' evolutionary tracks , solar metallicity , the @xcite initial mass function with lower and upper mass cutoffs 0.1  m@xmath55 and 100  m@xmath55 , and modeled the extinction by dust using the attenuation law of @xcite .",
    "a new burst of star formation lasting 100  myr and contributing 20% to the mass is also added at @xmath56  yr ( @xmath57  yr ) at @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) to explore more complex sfhs .    as can be deduced from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the differences between observed and predicted colors could be due to larger amount of dust and/or to more complex sfhs in the observed galaxies .",
    "the ad hoc treatment of dust absorption is a significant and well - known source of uncertainty in the models .",
    "modifications to the specific dust model could partly resolve the differences between observations and sam predictions . by simply multiplying the @xmath58 in the sam by a fixed factor",
    ", we were able to better reproduce the observed lfs at @xmath4 ( although making the faint - end slope of the red galaxy lfs quantitatively too steep ) and to have a better agreement between observed and predicted colors .",
    "however , at @xmath3 this simple remedy is not able to solve the disagreement between the predicted and the observed number of @xmath59 galaxies .",
    "we conclude that , while ad hoc modifications of the dust treatment might help to alleviate some of the found disagreements , it does not seem to be sufficient to accommodate the problem with global colors at @xmath3 .",
    "while our ability to simulate galaxy formation has greatly improved in the past few years , our results imply that the present understanding of the physical processes at work in galaxy formation and evolution is still far from being satisfactory . on the observational side ,",
    "more accurate redshift and color estimates would benefit studies of this kind .",
    "the lack of spectroscopic redshifts is particularly worrying , as systematic errors in redshift will lead to systematic errors in colors and luminosities ( e.g. , @xcite ; m. kriek et al .",
