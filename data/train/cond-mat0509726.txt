    "it has been observed in many domains of physics [ 1 ] that hamiltonian systems with long - range interactions spontaneously organize into coherent structures which persist for a long time .",
    "some examples are galaxies in astrophysics , jets and vortices in 2d geophysical flows , clusters in the hmf model etc .",
    "these quasi - stationary states ( qss ) are usually _ not _ described by the boltzmann distribution . to account for this striking observational fact",
    ", some authors have proposed to replace the boltzmann entropy by the tsallis entropy @xmath0=-{1\\over q-1}\\int ( { f}^{q}-{f } ) d{\\bf r}d{\\bf v}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the reason advocated is that the system is non - extensive so that standard thermodynamics may not be applicable [ 2 ] .",
    "the maximization of the tsallis entropy at fixed mass and energy leads to @xmath1-distributions of the form @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the individual energy and @xmath4 , @xmath5 are lagrange multipliers .",
    "there are situations where these distributions provide a good _ fit _ [ 2,3 ] of the qss",
    ". however , there exists other situations [ 4 ] that are described neither by the boltzmann nor by the tsallis distribution [ 5 ] . we want to show that the prediction of the qss is relatively complicated and explain why . to that purpose ,",
    "we use classical methods of kinetic theory relying on the vlasov equation [ 1 ] .",
    "to understand the physics of the problem , we first have to develop a kinetic theory of systems with long - range interactions [ 1,6 ] .",
    "such kinetic theories have been developed for stellar systems , two - dimensional vortices , the hmf model etc .",
    "they usually lead to a kinetic equation for the distribution function @xmath6 of the form @xmath7 the left hand side , called the vlasov term , describes an advection in phase space due to the mean - field potential @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a binary potential of interaction .",
    "the right hand side takes into account the effect of `` collisions '' ( more generally correlations ) between particles and depends on the number @xmath10 of particles . for long - range interactions , it usually scales like @xmath11 with @xmath12 ( in general @xmath13 but for 1d systems @xmath14 ) .",
    "this term , due to finite @xmath10 effects ( graininess ) , is responsible for the _ collisional relaxation _ of the system towards ordinary statistical equilibrium .",
    "indeed , in general , the collision term cancels out only for the boltzmann distribution : @xmath15 . however , due to its dependence with the number of particles , the collisional relaxation time is of order @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the dynamical time . in general , this timescale is huge and does not represent the regime of most physical interest .",
    "in particular , the qss mentioned previously form on a timescale @xmath18 for which the collision term can be neglected in a first approximation . in that case , the evolution is collisionless and described by the vlasov equation : @xmath19 .",
    "now , it has been understood , first in astrophysics by hnon , king and lynden - bell in the 1960 s , that the vlasov equation , when coupled to a long - range force like the gravitational force ( vlasov - poisson system ) can undergo a form of _ collisionless relaxation _ on a very short timescale @xmath20 .",
    "this is called _ violent relaxation _ [ 7 ] .",
    "this general process explains the ubiquity of long - lived qss in systems with long - range interactions .",
    "the fine - grained df @xmath21 which is solution of the vlasov equation never achieves equilibrium but develops intermingled filaments at smaller and smaller scales due to _ phase mixing_. however , if we locally average over these filaments , the coarse - grained df @xmath22 is expected to converge toward a steady state which is a stable stationary solution of the vlasov equation .",
    "this is called weak convergence in mathematics .",
    "the kinetic theory explains that the lifetime of the qss scales as a power @xmath23 of the number of particles .",
    "the kinetic theory also explains that when the @xmath24 limit is taken before the @xmath25 limit we get the boltzmann statistical equilibrium state ( collisional relaxation ) but when the @xmath26 limit is taken before the @xmath24 limit we get a qss which is a stable stationary solution of the vlasov equation usually different from the boltzmann distribution ( collisionless regime ) .",
    "this non - commutation of the limits @xmath26 and @xmath27 has been observed numerically by [ 2 ] although they did not give an explanation in terms of the vlasov equation , as was done in [ 1 ] ( see sec .",
    "6.5 ) but rather in terms of tsallis generalized thermodynamics . on short timescales @xmath20 ,",
    "the system undergoes violent relaxation and reaches a stationary solution of the vlasov equation ( on the coarse - grained scale ) .",
    "since the vlasov equation admits an infinite number of stationary solutions , the solution ( qss ) effectively selected by the evolution is difficult to predict ( see below ) . on intermediate timescales",
    "@xmath28 , the system passes by a succession of quasi - stationary states that are quasi - stationary solutions of the vlasov equation @xmath29 slowly evolving with time due to `` collisions '' ( finite @xmath10 effects ) . in astrophysics ,",
    "this slow collisional evolution is governed by the orbit - averaged - fokker - planck equation . on a longer timescale @xmath30",
    ", collisions finally select the maxwell distribution among all stationary solutions of the vlasov equation ( the fate of gravitational systems is peculiar due to the absence of strict statistical equilibrium and the process of evaporation or collapse ) .",
    "these different regimes have been observed for different physical systems [ 1,6 ] and are illustrated numerically by yamaguchi _",
    "et al . _ [ 8 ] for the hmf model .",
    "in a seminal paper , lynden - bell [ 7 ] tried to _ predict _ the qss resulting from violent relaxation assuming that the system mixes well ( ergodicity ) and using arguments of statistical mechanics .",
    "however , the statistical mechanics of the vlasov equation is peculiar because of the presence of an infinite set of constraints : the casimirs @xmath31 ( for any function @xmath32 ) which contain all the moments @xmath33 of the distribution function .",
    "these are sort of `` hidden constraints '' [ 5 ] because they are not accessible from the ( observed ) coarse - grained df @xmath34 since @xmath35 for @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , the proper density probability to consider in the statistical theory of violent relaxation is @xmath37 which gives the density probability of finding the level of df @xmath38 in @xmath39 in phase space .",
    "note that we make the statistical mechanics of a _ field _ , the distribution function , not the statistical mechanics of _ discrete particles_. from this density probability , we can construct all the coarse - grained moments @xmath40 including the coarse - grained df @xmath41 .",
    "we can now introduce a mixing entropy from a combinatorial analysis [ 7,5 ] like in boltzmann s traditional approach . in the context of the vlasov equation , this entropy is a functional of @xmath37 of the form @xmath42=-\\int \\rho({\\bf r},{\\bf v},\\eta)\\ln\\rho({\\bf r},{\\bf v},\\eta)d{\\bf r}d{\\bf v}d\\eta . \\label{p5}\\ ] ] the lynden - bell entropy ( [ p5 ] ) is the proper form of boltzmann entropy taking into account the specificities of the vlasov equation .",
    "assuming ergodicity ( efficient mixing ) , the qss is obtained by maximizing @xmath43 $ ] at fixed mass , energy and casimir invariants .",
    "this leads to an optimal @xmath44 from which we obtain the optimal coarse - grained distribution @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath5 are the usual lagrange multipliers associated with the conservation of mass @xmath47 and energy @xmath48 while @xmath49 takes into account the conservation of all the casimirs invariants @xmath50 [ 5 ] .",
    "we note that , even if the system mixes well ( ergodicity ) , the coarse - grained df predicted by lynden - bell may _ differ _ from the boltzmann distribution : @xmath51 ( in general ) due to the presence of the casimir invariants . in the simplest case ( two - levels approximation )",
    "the df predicted by lynden - bell is similar to the fermi - dirac statistics : @xmath52 [ 9 ] .",
    "more generally , the coarse - grained df ( [ p6 ] ) is a sort of _ superstatistics _ [ 5,10 ] as it is expressed as a superposition of boltzmann distributions ( universal ) weighted by a non - universal factor @xmath53 depending on the initial conditions .",
    "furthermore , like for the beck - cohen superstatistics , the coarse - grained df ( [ p6 ] ) maximizes a `` generalized entropy '' in @xmath34-space @xmath54=-\\int c(\\overline{f})d{\\bf r}d{\\bf v}$ ] with @xmath55 ( where @xmath56 ) at fixed mass and energy [ 5 ]",
    ". the distribution ( [ p6 ] ) and the corresponding entropy @xmath54 $ ] are non - universal .",
    "however , a general prediction of the lynden - bell statistical theory [ 7 ] is that the qss is a stationary solution of the vlasov equation of the form @xmath57 with @xmath58 : the df depends only on the energy and is monotonically decreasing .",
    "furthermore , @xmath59 : the coarse - grained df is bounded by the maximum value of the initial df .",
    "the lynden - bell df ( [ p6 ] ) is the proper prediction of the qss when mixing is efficient ( ergodic ) during violent relaxation .",
    "there are situations where the lynden - bell prediction works relatively well , e.g. [ 11 ] .",
    "however , it has been recognized in many other occasions [ 4 ] that mixing is _ not _ efficient enough to sustain the hypothesis of ergodicity on which the theory is built so that the prediction of lynden - bell fails in practice : @xmath60 ( in general ) [ 1 ] .",
    "this is particularly obvious in the case of self - gravitating systems because the lynden - bell entropy has no maximum at fixed ( finite ) mass and energy [ 7,9 ] .",
    "what can we do to account for _ incomplete relaxation _ ?",
    "a first possibility would be to change the form of entropy .",
    "for example , we could try to use the `` generalized thermodynamics '' of tsallis .",
    "however , as explained previously , the proper density probability is @xmath37 so that the proper form of tsallis entropy in the context of vlasov systems is [ 5 ] : @xmath61=-{1\\over q-1}\\int \\left\\lbrack \\rho^{q}({\\bf r},{\\bf v},\\eta)-\\rho({\\bf r},{\\bf v},\\eta)\\right\\rbrack d{\\bf r}d{\\bf v}d\\eta , \\label{p10}\\ ] ] instead of ( [ p1 ] ) . for @xmath62",
    "it returns the lynden - bell entropy ( [ p5 ] ) . in this line of thought",
    ", @xmath1 would measure the efficiency of mixing ( @xmath62 if the evolution is ergodic ) . for @xmath63 , the functional ( [ p10 ] )",
    "could describe non - ergodic behaviours ( incomplete mixing ) .",
    "however , it is not clear why all non - ergodic behaviours could be described by a simple functional such as ( [ p10 ] ) .",
    "tsallis entropy may describe a certain type of non - ergodicity ( fractal or multifractal ) with phase - space structures but probably not all of them .",
    "in particular , observations of elliptical galaxies in astrophysics [ 4 ] do _ not _ favour tsallis form of entropy since elliptical galaxies are not _ stellar polytropes _ that would be the prediction based on the @xmath1-entropy [ 5 ] .",
    "therefore , @xmath64 ( in general ) .    another possibility is to keep the lynden - bell entropy as the most fundamental entropy of the problem but develop a _",
    "dynamical _ theory of violent relaxation . indeed ,",
    "if relaxation is incomplete , we must understand why .",
    "qualitatively , the collisionless relaxation is driven by the fluctuations of the field @xmath65 .",
    "now , these fluctuations can vanish before the system had time to relax completely so that the system can remain frozen in a stationary state of the vlasov equation which is not the most mixed state . by using a phenomenological maximum entropy production principle ( mepp ) , we have proposed in [ 12 ] to describe the out - of - equilibrium evolution of the probability density @xmath66 by a relaxation equation of the form @xmath67 if the diffusion coefficient were constant , this equation would relax towards the lynden - bell distribution",
    ". however , it is argued in [ 12 ] that @xmath68 is _ not _ constant .",
    "indeed , the relaxation is driven by the fluctuations of the field @xmath69 , itself induced by the fluctuations of @xmath70 , so that the diffusion coefficient should be proportional to @xmath71 and vanish in the regions of phase space where these fluctuations vanish . moreover , as the system approaches ( quasi)-equilibrium , the fluctuations of the field @xmath72 are less and less efficient so that the diffusion coefficient should also decay with time . for these reasons , it can become very small @xmath73 in certain regions of phase space ( where mixing is not very efficient ) and for large times ( as the fluctuations weaken ) .",
    "the diffusion coefficient can also rapidly decay with the velocity .",
    "the vanishing of the diffusion coefficient can `` freeze '' the system in a subdomain of phase space ( bubble ) and account for incomplete relaxation and non - ergodicity .",
    "the relaxation equation ( [ p13 ] ) should then tend to a distribution which is only _ partially mixed _ and which is usually different from the lynden - bell and the tsallis distributions .",
    "however , this approach demands to solve a dynamical equation ( [ p13 ] ) -smoother than the vlasov equation- to predict the metaequilibrium state .",
    "the idea is that , in case of incomplete relaxation ( non - ergodicity ) , the prediction of the qss is impossible without considering the dynamics : it depends on the `` route to equilibrium '' .",
    "maybe , we have to accept that , in general , the qss is _ unpredictable _ in case of incomplete relaxation .",
    "we can expect , however , that @xmath74 is a stable stationary solution of the vlasov equation .",
    "we are thus led to construct stable stationary solutions of the vlasov equation is order to _ reproduce _ observations .",
    "the vlasov equation admits an infinite number of stationary solutions given by the jeans theorem , but not all of them are stable .",
    "of course , only stable solutions must be considered and their selection is a difficult problem . if we restrict ourselves to df of the form @xmath75 with @xmath76 depending only on the energy ( in astrophysics , such distributions characterize a subclass of _ spherical _ stellar systems ) , it is possible to provide a simple criterion of nonlinear dynamical stability . such df extremize a functional of the form @xmath77=-\\int c(f)d{\\bf r}d{\\bf v}$ ] , where @xmath78 is convex , at fixed mass and energy [ 13 ] .",
    "indeed , the first variations @xmath79 yield a df of the form @xmath80 with @xmath81 montonically decreasing . if , furthermore , the df _ maximizes _ this functional ( at fixed @xmath48 , @xmath47 ) , then it is nonlinearly dynamically stable with respect to the vlasov equation [ 13,8,14 ] .",
    "the intrinsic reason is that @xmath77 $ ] , @xmath82 $ ] and @xmath83 $ ] are individually conserved by the vlasov equation .",
    "therefore , if @xmath84 is the maximum of @xmath77 $ ] ( at fixed @xmath48 , @xmath47 ) , a small perturbation @xmath6 will remain close ( in some norm ) to this maximum .",
    "it is important to note that this criterion of nonlinear dynamical stability is remarkably consistent with the phenomenology [ 5 ] of violent relaxation if we view the relevant df as the _ coarse - grained _ df . indeed , during mixing @xmath85 and the functionals @xmath86=-\\int c(\\overline{f})d{\\bf r}d{\\bf v}$ ] calculated with the coarse - grained df increase ( @xmath87 decrease ) in the sense that @xmath88\\ge h[\\overline{f}({\\bf r},{\\bf v},0)]$ ] for @xmath89 where it is assumed that initially the system is not mixed : @xmath90 . because of this property similar to the boltzmann @xmath91-theorem in kinetic theory ,- functions ) and the time evolution of the @xmath91-functions is not necessarily monotonic ( nothing is implied concerning the relative values of @xmath92 and @xmath93 for @xmath94 ) . ]",
    "@xmath86 $ ] are called generalized @xmath91-functions [ 13 ] . by constrast ,",
    "@xmath95 $ ] and @xmath96 $ ] are approximately conserved . therefore , this generalized _ selective decay principle _ [ 5 ] ( decrease of @xmath97 $ ] at fixed @xmath48 , @xmath47 ) due to phase mixing and coarse - graining can explain _ how _ @xmath34 can possibly reach a maximum of @xmath91 at fixed mass and energy ( while @xmath77 $ ] is rigorously conserved on the fine - grained scale ) .",
    "after mixing @xmath98 and the functionals @xmath86 $ ] ( as well as @xmath95 $ ] and @xmath96 $ ] ) are conserved by the coarse - grained flow .",
    "therefore , if @xmath34 has reached ( as a result of mixing ) a maximum of @xmath91 , it will be nonlinearly dynamically stable with respect to coarse - grained perturbations ( after mixing ) in virtue of the above - mentioned stability result .    in reality",
    ", the problem is more complicated because the system can converge toward a stationary solution of the vlasov equation which does not depend on the energy @xmath99 alone , and thus which does not maximize an @xmath91-function at fixed @xmath48 , @xmath47 .",
    "for example , the velocity distribution of stars in elliptical galaxies is anisotropic and depends on the angular momentum @xmath100 in addition to energy @xmath99 .",
    "furthermore , real stellar systems are in general not spherically symmetric so their df does not only depend on @xmath99 and @xmath101 .",
    "therefore , more general stationary solutions of the vlasov equation must be constructed in consistency with the jeans theorem .",
    "elliptical galaxies are well relaxed ( in the sense of lynden - bell ) in their inner region ( leading to an isotropic isothermal core with density profile @xmath102 ) while they possess radially anisotropic envelopes ( with density profile @xmath103 ) .",
    "stiavelli & bertin [ 4 ] introduced an @xmath104 model of the form @xmath105 for @xmath106 ( and @xmath107 otherwise ) based on the possibility that the _ a priori _ probabilities of microstates are not equal due to kinetic constraints .",
    "this model reproduces many properties of ellipticals but it has the undesired feature of being `` too isotropic '' .",
    "then , they introduced another model based on a modification of the lynden - bell statistical theory .",
    "they considered the maximization of the boltzmann entropy ( in lynden - bell s sense ) at fixed mass , energy _ and _ a third global quantity @xmath108 which is argued to be approximately conserved during violent relaxation .",
    "this variational principle results in a family of @xmath109 models @xmath110 .",
    "these models are able to fit products of @xmath10-body simulations over nine orders of magnitude in density and to reproduce the de vaucouleur s @xmath111 law ( or more general @xmath112 laws ) of ellipticals .",
    "the introduction of additional constraints in the variational principle could be a way to take into account effects of incomplete violent relaxation .",
    "we note finally that the vlasov equation can have a very complicated , non - ergodic , dynamics . for example , in the gravitational 1d vlasov - poisson system , phase - space holes which block the relaxation towards the lynden - bell distribution ( incomplete relaxation ) have been observed [ 15 ] . in that case",
    ", the system does not even relax towards a stationary state of the vlasov equation but develops everlasting oscillations .",
    "rapisarda & pluchino [ 16 ] have also observed transient phase - space structures in their @xmath10-body simulations of the hmf model and they have proposed an interesting analogy with glassy dynamics .",
    "these results are not necessarily in contradiction with the vlasov equation ( as they beleive ) , even for the inhomogeneous situations that they consider .",
    "it would be of interest to check whether these phase - space structures can also be obtained by solving the vlasov equation for the hmf model .",
    "non - boltzmannian distributions appear in the study of hamiltonian systems with long - range interactions . for these systems ,",
    "the collisional relaxation time towards statistical equilibrium ( boltzmann distribution ) is huge because it increases as a power of the number of particles @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , the evolution of the system is described by the vlasov equation on a very long timescale [ 1 ] .",
    "now , because of phase mixing and violent relaxation , the vlasov equation can spontaneously lead to the formation of coherent structures : galaxies in astrophysics , jets and vortices in hydrodynamics , clusters in the hmf model , bars in disk galaxies ... these qss are ( nonlinearly ) dynamically stable stationary solutions of the vlasov equation which are not necessarily described by the boltzmann distribution .",
    "indeed , the vlasov equation admits an infinite number of stationary solutions and the system can be trapped in one of them . in general , the qss is _ non - universal _ as it depends : ( i ) on the _ detailed _ structure of the initial conditions ( through the casimirs , in addition to mass and energy ) and ( ii ) on the efficiency of mixing ( ergodicity ) . in this vlasov context , the tsallis distributions are _ particular _ stationary solutions of the vlasov equation which correspond to what are called _ stellar polytropes _ in astrophysics [ 5,14 ] .",
    "in addition , the tsallis functional @xmath113 $ ] is a _ particular _ @xmath91-function [ 13 ] , not an entropy ( which would be a functional @xmath114 $ ] ) .",
    "its maximization at fixed mass and energy yields a criterion of nonlinear dynamical stability with respect to the vlasov equation [ 8,13,14 ] , not a criterion of generalized thermodynamical stability .",
    "a formal _ thermodynamical analogy _ [ 14 ] can however be developed to investigate the nonlinear dynamical stability problem ."
