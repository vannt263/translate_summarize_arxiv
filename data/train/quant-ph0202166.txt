    "quantum stochastic calculus ( qsc ) @xcite@xcite is a noncommutative analogue of the classical ito s calculus and it has had many applications in modelling quantum optical systems @xcite@xcite . in particular , inside qsc a schrdinger equation for unitary operators can be formulated , the hudson - parthasarathy equation @xcite , which is well suited to treat the interaction between matter and electromagnetic field within the usual approximation schemes of quantum optics @xcite .",
    "the simplest , non trivial matter - field system is a two - level atom stimulated by a laser . the fluorescence spectrum of such a system , in the case of a perfectly monochromatic laser , was obtained by mollow @xcite ; then , the case of a laser with a lorentzian spectrum was developed by kimble and mandel @xcite .",
    "qsc and hudson - parthasarathy equation give not only the way of giving an unified treatment of such a system and of connecting it to the photon - detection theory , but they allow also to explore possible corrections to the dynamics and to obtain modifications of the mollow spectrum . in the usual treatments , the scattering of the light by the atom is described by the absorption / emission process due to the electric dipole interaction involving only two states of the atom .",
    "but even if the absorption / emission process would be forbidden and the atom would be frozen in the up or down level , some scattering of light would remain , due to the response of the atom as a whole ; we can call it `` direct scattering '' . for instance , in a perturbative development in feynman graphs , scattering processes would be generated also by virtual transitions starting and ending in one of the two states left in the description , but involving as intermediate states the other ones , which have been eliminated in the final description .",
    "the use of hudson - parthasarathy equation allows , even when the atom is approximated by a two - level system , for the introduction of both the `` absorption / emission channel '' and the `` direct scattering channel '' .",
    "this modified model , in the case of a perfectly monochromatic laser , has been presented in @xcite and developed in @xcite ; the first results for a non monochromatic laser have been obtained in @xcite .    in section [ model ]",
    "we give the mathematical model for the dynamics of the two - level atom interacting with the electromagnetic field , including the polarization of the light and the degeneracy of the up and down levels , which has never been considered before and which has an effect on the angular dependence of the spectrum .",
    "we consider the usual dipole interaction and the possible corrections giving the direct scattering ; the so called phase diffusion model is used for the laser as in @xcite . in section [ flspectrum ] the general formulae for the spectrum are obtained and its angular dependence is discussed .",
    "then , the total spectrum , integrated over the whole solid angle , is studied . in the case of only the absorption / emission process in the interaction term , we reobtain the mollow spectrum @xcite for a perfectly monochromatic laser and the kimble - mandel spectrum @xcite for a non monochromatic laser with lorentzian spectrum . in the case of the modified model ,",
    "when also the direct scattering is included , but the laser is perfectly monochromatic , we reobtain the results of @xcite , although there the level degeneracy was not taken into account .",
    "according to the values of the various parameters , the fluorescence spectrum can present a well resolved triplet structure as in the mollow spectrum , but also it can be distorted and made asymmetric by the presence of the new terms . experiments @xcite@xcite confirm essentially the triplet structure ; some asymmetry has been found and its origin has been attributed to various causes .",
    "the presence of the new terms we have introduced could give a model for treating such an asymmetry .",
    "when the laser bandwidth is taken into account , the modified model gives corrections to the spectrum found in @xcite by kimble and mandel .",
    "let us recall the rules of qsc and the hudson - parthasarathy equation ; this is just to fix our notations , while for the proper mathematical presentation we refer to the book by parthasarathy @xcite .",

    "the figures 5 and 6 of @xcite give , for @xmath292 , @xmath293 on the z - axis versus @xmath294 on the x - axis and @xmath299 on the y - axis ; figure 5 is for @xmath297 , @xmath300 and figure 6 is for @xmath301 , @xmath302 .",
    "for a laser of low intensity the spectrum reduces to @xmath303 @xmath304 in this case one sees well why a decomposition in elastic and inelastic parts is not possible for @xmath268 .",
    "indeed , one has two peaks , one centered at @xmath305 ( laser frequency ) and one centered at @xmath306 ( atomic frequency ) ; the first peak can be interpreted as coming from an elastic channel and the second one as coming from an inelastic channel , but the second term in the r.h.s .",
    "of gives rise to an interference term between the two channels .     for @xmath278 , @xmath279 , @xmath307 and laser bandwidths @xmath281 .",
    "solid lines : modified model with the parameters given in section [ parameters ] ; dashed lines : usual model . ]      for a very large bandwidth , @xmath308 , the spectrum becomes independent from the detuning and reduces to @xmath309 where @xmath310 is given in and @xmath311 note the @xmath312-dependent position of the peak , which can be interpreted as a light shift .",
    "in the _ usual case _ @xmath236 becomes purely lorentzian , centered in zero and with @xmath312-independent width : @xmath313      in the general case the total spectrum is given by equations ( [ spectrum]). in figures 1 , 2 and 3 we compare the spectrum predicted by the usual model ( dashed lines ) , in which only the absorption / emission channel is present , with the spectrum predicted by our modified model ( solid lines ) , in which both the absorption / emission channel and the direct scattering channel are present . in both models",
    "we take @xmath278 , @xmath314 ; the usual model is characterized by @xmath283 , @xmath315 , @xmath285 , while as an example of modified model we choose @xmath270 , @xmath271 , @xmath316 , @xmath317 , @xmath318 , @xmath274 .",
    "we consider three laser detunings @xmath319 and four laser bandwidths @xmath320 .",
    "our choice of the parameters for the modified model is such that for a monochromatic laser in resonance ( figure 1(a ) ) the modified spectrum is not quantitatively too different from the usual one , but its asymmetry is clear .",
    "the differences between the two cases are enhanced by the presence of both the detuning and the bandwidth .     for @xmath278 , @xmath279 , @xmath296 and laser bandwidths @xmath281 .",
    "solid lines : modified model with the parameters given in section [ parameters ] ; dashed lines : usual model . ]    finally in figure 4 we consider a large bandwidth ; however , @xmath198 is not much larger than @xmath245 , so that we are not exactly in the case of section [ broadband ] .",
    "anyway , only a peak survives and the spectrum is nearly independent from the detuning . in the usual case",
    "we see a nearly lorentzian shape , centered at @xmath321 ( @xmath169 near the atomic frequency @xmath73 ) and with a very weak residual @xmath312-dependence . in the modified case",
    "the spectrum is strongly asymmetric and the position of the peak and the width are @xmath312-dependent .     for laser bandwidth @xmath322 and @xmath278 , @xmath323 , @xmath324 .",
    "the parameters of the modified model are given in section [ parameters ] . ]",

    "<S> by means of quantum stochastic calculus we construct a model for an atom with two degenerate levels and stimulated by a laser and we compute its fluorescence spectrum ; let us stress that , once the model for the unitary atom - field dynamics has been given , then the spectrum is computed without further approximations . if only the absorption / emission term is included in the interaction , we reobtain the mollow spectrum in the case of a monochromatic laser and the kimble - mandel spectrum in the case of a `` phase diffusion model '' for a non monochromatic laser . </S>",
    "<S> however , our model can describe also another type of light scattering , a `` direct scattering '' due to the response of the atom as a whole , which we expect to be small , but which interferes with the scattering due to the absorption / emission channel . </S>",
    "<S> when both the scattering channels are introduced we obtain a modification of the mollow - kimble - mandel spectrum , which shares the main features with the usual case , but which presents some asymmetries even in the case of no detuning . </S>"
