    "in our previous work on steering with josephson phase qubits @xcite we found two peculiar single - step controlled - not ( cnot ) implementations involving off - resonance qubits detuned by the amount smaller than the characteristic coupling constant .",
    "does the detuning always have to be so small ? what happens if it gets larger ?",
    "these questions seem to be important on several counts .",
    "firstly , the majority of entangling gate designs proposed in the literature assume resonant qubits @xcite .",
    "( however , see refs .",
    "@xcite for notable exceptions . )",
    "this is hardly surprising since in the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) typically used to analyze superconducting qubits the resonant condition leads to relatively simple and easily solvable hamiltonians containing no local @xmath2 terms .",
    "this works well when the system consists of only two qubits .",
    "however , it is reasonable to expect that when thousands of such qubits are assembled into an integrated circuit , maintaining them on resonance will become a difficult task . how then can we be sure that an architecture involving detuned qubits is able to reliably generate universal gates , such as , for example , a cnot gate ?",
    "secondly , some qubits may be fabricated with various defects preventing them from being tuned to resonance exactly .",
    "would they still be usable ? and what if for some applications it becomes advantageous ( or even necessary ) to use qubits with intrinsically different level splittings ?",
    "thirdly , we should also keep in mind that detuning is routinely used in actual experiments to `` decouple '' the qubits in order to perform local ( that is , nonentangling ) operations @xcite",
    ". it would be useful if , after such decoupling is performed , we do not have to worry about bringing the qubits back to exact resonance when doing subsequent entangling operations .",
    "additionally , from the purely theoretical viewpoint , decoupling provides a useful limit against which to check our calculations .",
    "if at larger detuning the interaction is expected to lose its entangling properties , we must be able to predict a crossover into the regime when the gate fidelity ( of the cnot , in our case ) starts to deteriorate .",
    "thus , the primary goal of this paper will be to establish the exact conditions under which such crossover occurs for previously proposed cnot implementations involving superconducting qubits .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :    in section [ sec : hamiltonian ] we introduce the hamiltonian for capacitively and inductively coupled josephson phase qubits .",
    "since there is an infinite number of possible local drives and rotating frames to choose from , it will be necessary to limit our discussion to situations that are simple and yet powerful enough to provide some new and interesting physical insights .",
    "our specific choices for rabi pulses and rotating frames will be made in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ih ] ) , ( [ eq : hathrwa ] ) , and ( [ eq : hrwa ] ) of that section .    in section [ sec:2step ]",
    "we generalize to finite detuning the familiar two - step cnot sequence involving a local @xmath3-pulse sandwiched between two entanling operations .",
    "the exact bound on detuning that guarantees generation of the perfect ( in the rwa ) controlled - not logic gate will then be given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bound2 ] ) .    in section [ sec:1step ] we numerically solve the single - step case .",
    "we will see that in that case the restriction on detuning for perfect cnot generation is somewhat stronger than in the two - step case ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : bound1 ] ) ) .    in section [ sec : largedetuning ] we present optimal results for approximate cnot gates at detuning larger than maximally allowed .",
    "we will see how the makhlin invariants and fidelity of the optimized gates deviate from their ideal cnot values .",
    "we will also simulate the weyl chamber steering trajectories corresponding to such optimized gates .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] with a brief summary of our results .",
    "in what follows , we will use the notation that is convenient for lie algebraic manipulations , & & x_k = _ k^x , y_k = _ k^y , z_k = _ k^z , ( k = 1,2 ) , + & & xx = _",

    "notice , that @xmath4=[xy , yx]=0 $ ] , and @xmath5 commutes with each of the @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 operators .    why is this notation convenient ?    consider the following transformation ( called `` going to a rotated frame '' ) on the lie algebra @xmath10 of the two - qubit system : [ eq : lierotation ] xx e^-z_1 xx e^z_1 = xx + xy .",
    "this transformation can be nicely interpreted as a rotation of vector @xmath6 by an angle @xmath11 in the _ real _ vector space spanned by the generators of the group su(4 ) .",
    "this is how the continuous group acts on its lie algebra .",
    "mathematicians call it the adjoint representation .",
    "the algebra plays the role of the representation space for its own group .",
    "since we do work at the level of algebra , and not at the level of the hilbert space when discussing equivalence classes of gates , this is a very convenient notation .",
    "it simplifies things .",
    "also notice how naturally the periodicity of @xmath12 appears at this level of description .",
    "now , if we were to write the same transformation in terms of the pauli matrices , we would have to remember to put in the imaginary unit @xmath13 and the factors of 1/2 in the exponents on the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lierotation ] ) , @xmath14 breaking its beautiful symmetry .",
    "when restricted to the computational subspace , the hamiltonian for two coupled josephson phase qubits , one of which is driven by a resonant rf pulse , is given by [ eq : ih ] ih(t ) & = & -z_1 -(+ ) z_2 + & & + 2 _ 1(t)x_1 + 2(g yy + zz ) , where @xmath15 are the coupling constants , @xmath16 is the level splitting of the first qubit , @xmath17 is the detuning , and @xmath18 is the corresponding rabi frequency . here",
