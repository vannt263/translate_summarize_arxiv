    "cometary ices have undergone little or no processing since their formation in the solar nebula and thus they represent an important clue in understanding the conditions in the early solar system . however , this interpretation is complicated by the radial mixings in the protoplanetary disk and the dynamical evolution of comets , expelled to the outer solar system from their original formation site .",
    "no pattern for the cometary composition and activity has emerged from the objects studied to date @xcite and a larger sample is needed .",
    "the composition of cometary ices has been studied through spectroscopic observations or _ in situ _ measurements . in the analysis of cometary spectra",
    "it is important to establish whether the observed chemical species originate in the nucleus ( native source ) or in the coma ( extended source ) . for this purpose ,",
    "spatially - resolved observations are needed to derive the radial composition of the gas outflow .",
    "carbon monoxide ( co ) is one of the most abundant molecules , whose mixing ratio relative to water varies greatly among comets @xcite . as a highly volatile compound , with a sublimation temperature of 24  k , co ice is thought to be a sensitive tracer of the temperature in the environment in which the comets formed .",
    "however , its origin as a native compound or a daughter product , and the correlation between the two sources is still not understood .",
    "infrared observations of the co ro - vibrational lines conclude that the co source was mainly native in comet c/1996  b2  ( hyakutake ) @xcite and significantly extended for comet c/1995  o1  ( hale - bopp ) @xcite .",
    "this paper complements previous findings with the first co radial profiles constructed from ultraviolet spectra .",
    "care must be taken in interpreting the brightness profiles , since saturation close to the nucleus could mimic the presence of an extended source .",
    "a comprehensive fluorescence model is developed to derive reliable co column densities and estimate co production rates from cometary spectra obtained by the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) and the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) . using the long - slit capabilities of the stis instrument , this",
    "paper offers evidence that the native source of co is dominant in three long period comets .",

    "this follows from the observed change in the relative intensities in various vibrational progressions as the offset from the comet center increases ( see   3 ) .",
    "self - absorption makes it difficult to derive a reliable value for the co column density in the absence of a model that takes into account optical depth effects .    a detailed model of the @xmath3 system",

    "we constructed a database containing @xmath25 transitions between the first 50 rotational levels of each of the 37 vibrational levels of @xmath26 and the 23 vibrational levels of @xmath27 , taking into account the energy shifts and mixings of the transition probabilities due to interactions between the different parity sublevels @xcite . using a simple approximation for fluorescence in subordinate lines @xcite , expanded with a comprehensive treatment of self - absorption , our model offers an excellent fit to the data .",

    "given that @xmath16 and @xmath1-stis observations of comets c/2000  wm@xmath2  ( linear ) and c/2001  q4  ( neat ) were nearly simultaneous , we choose to include in table  [ table1 ] a summary of @xmath16 observations for completeness @xcite .",
    "the fourth positive group of co , @xmath27  ",
    "@xmath26 , has non - negligible overlap integrals for most of the non - diagonal vibrational transitions .",
    "while for the @xmath20 and @xmath19 systems it is enough to model just the ( 00 ) and ( 10 ) bands , for the @xmath3 system we must take into account all bands connecting all 37 vibrational levels of the @xmath26 state with all 23 vibrational levels of the @xmath27 state . using only the first 50 rotational levels , which should be sufficient for typical physical conditions in cometary comae , the final database contains almost @xmath32 transitions .",

    "the rotational transition probabilities @xmath33 were obtained from the band transition probabilities @xmath34 @xcite . even though there are three rotational branches ( p , q and r , @xmath35 ) possible from the same rotational level of the @xmath27 state ( @xmath36 ) , due to the parity selection rule , the excitation rates and branching ratios for the p and r branches do not mix with those for the q branch .",
    "each @xmath37 level of the @xmath27 state is split into 2 opposite parity sublevels ( @xmath38-doubling ) that have different energies and interactions with neighboring levels of other electronic states @xcite .",
    "the energy level shifts and the changes in the lifetimes due to these interactions were taken into account when available @xcite .    in a first approximation",
    ", the fluorescent emission in the fourth positive group of co is modeled following the prescription from  @xcite .",
    "this model successfully accounts for saturation in the absorption of the exciting radiation , using a voigt profile with line overlap",
    ". a quick look at the data , however , shows that this approach only partially accounts for optical depth effects , and we must extend the model to include self - absorption in the fluorescent cascade .",
    "the stis spectra of comet 153p / ikeya - zhang shown in figure  [ vlines ] are averaged over effective apertures of increasing size , centered on the comet nucleus .",
    "self - absorption is easily recognized by noting that the bands connecting to the ground vibrational level ( 00 , 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 ) show little decrease in brightness as we increase the integrated slit area and the average column density becomes lower , while the other bands from the progressions originating in the same upper level ( see the unblended 01 , 13 , 22 , 23 , 41 and 51 ) decrease strongly in intensity , so that at low column densities the relative line ratios are in agreement with the optically thin limit .",
    "the treatment of self - absorption is made under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) , using the fact that the photon mean free path corresponds to an optical depth @xmath39 of one .",
    "given that the gas temperature in the coma is less than 100  k for our observations , under lte conditions we need only to take into account absorption out of the lowest ( 0 ) vibrational level of @xmath26 .",
    "unlike for h@xmath24 for example , the ro - vibrational levels of the ground state of co have short lifetimes , making lte a good approximation .",
    "the lines connecting to v  =  0 for which @xmath39 at line center is greater than one are considered self - absorbed .",
    "only an effective column density @xmath40 , smaller than the total absorbing column @xmath41 , will contribute to the observed emission in a self - absorbed transition @xmath42 .",
    "the excess brightness , due to absorption by the total column density @xmath41 , is then redistributed among the optically thin lines originating in the same upper level @xmath43 according to the branching ratios , as seen in figure  [ mod ] .",
    "the model is constructed in the approximation of a uniform plane - parallel atmosphere .",
    "this approximation is of limited use , due to the spherical symmetry of the comet atmosphere and the sun - comet - earth geometry .",
    "the breakdown is more apparent for larger column densities , such as in the case of comet c/1996  b2  ( hyakutake ) , discussed in   4.2 . in the optically thin regime ,",
    "valid at larger distances from the comet nucleus , as well as for unresolved objects , such geometrical effects are negligible . introducing geometrical corrections in our model",
    "can be done by allowing the column density entering the absorption step to be different from the column density used for emission and self - absorption .",
    "this procedure accounts for the fact that the projected column density along the line - of - sight is larger than the column density towards the exciting radiation source .",
    "this difference leads both to the decrease in line saturation and to the enhancement of the optically thin lines versus the optically thick ones due to more self - absorption .",
    "the method is very robust , providing line intensities in agreement with the data .",
    "although the brightness of the @xmath3 bands for the same comet should differ slightly from one observation to another due to varying comet heliocentric and geocentric distances , as well as due to possible periodic variations in the volatile vaporization rate , this variation is within the error bars of the observations and the use of an averaged stis spectrum for each comet in order to improve the signal - to - noise ratio is warranted .",

    "first pointed out that scattering of lyman-@xmath5 by the ( 14,0 ) band is comparable to , if not larger than , the direct solar scattering by all other bands of the co fourth positive system for co column densities @xmath89  @xmath53 . the ( 14,4 ) band",
    "was subsequently identified in the spectrum of venus @xcite .",
    "these bands are not detected in any of the stis comet spectra .",
    "the high column density in the field - of - view of comet hyakutake makes them visible , albeit at low s / n , and allows for a determination of column density independent of optical saturation effects . in evaluating the fluorescence efficiency of these bands ,",
    "the overlap between the solar lines and the individual lines of the co bands is a sensitive function of rotational temperature and heliocentric velocity and requires accurate profiles of the solar lines @xcite .",
    "the ( 14 - 3 ) , ( 14 - 4 ) , and ( 9 - 2 ) bands are included in the model and are seen to be completely consistent with the co column density derived above .",
    "we note that the optically thick bands connecting to the v  =  0 level of the ground state , namely ( 1 - 0 ) at 1509.8  , ( 2 - 0 ) at 1477.6  , ( 3 - 0 ) at 1447.4  , ( 4 - 0 ) at 1419.1   and ( 5 - 0 ) at 1392.6  , all labeled in figure  [ hkt ] , do not show a significant variation due to geometric corrections .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that while the correction adjusts the line - of - sight column density relative to the column absorbing the solar radiation , the emission in the optically thick lines will still be determined by the column corresponding to one optical depth , which depends only on temperature and @xmath44 parameter .",
    "the ( 0 - 0 ) band at 1544.5   does not seem to follow this pattern due to blending with the ( 3 - 2 ) band at 1542.5  .",
    "the same lack of variation is exhibited by the bands belonging to optically thin progressions pumped by solar emission lines , such as ( 14 - 3 ) at 1315.7   and ( 9 - 2 ) at 1377.8  .",
    "this is a result of the simple linear scaling in the optically thin limit , which makes the absorbing column indistinguishable from the emitting column .",
    "the derived column densities are subject to uncertainties due to the choice of model parameters and background subtraction .",
    "a more complete model would involve a multidimensional @xmath47 minimization to constrain simultaneously the column density , rotational temperature and doppler @xmath44 parameter .",
    "aside from the fact that this approach requires rather large computational resources , we expect that given the quality of the data the resulting @xmath47 3d surfaces will have rather low contrast minima and the improvement in the resulting production rates would be negligible .",
    "more of a concern is the background subtraction in the @xmath1-stis data .",
    "the background is variable both in the spatial and spectral directions from one observation to another , making it impossible to give a comprehensive subtraction prescription .",
    "the optimal background subtraction is determined on a case - by - case basis .",
    "while the background - related uncertainties can lead to @xmath3030% variations in the values for the column densities , we estimate that the change in the resulting production rates is only about 6% .",
    "these values are only slightly larger than the @xmath54 error bars from the @xmath47 minimization .",
    "similarly , increasing the rotational temperature from 70  k to 100  k results in a @xmath3030% decrease in production rate .",
    "however , the rotational temperatures relevant for our observations were derived from either @xmath16 observations or from the t@xmath90 vs. r@xmath91 dependences obtained by radio measurements , and are constrained to better than @xmath826  k. this results only in a @xmath307% variation in production rate , as the heliocentric distance of the comet does not vary significantly during our observations .",
    "the absolute values of the co production rate and column density are also sensitive to the stis calibration pipeline , which is based on point - source stellar standards .",
    "the column densities derived from stis data could be overpredicted by at most 30% due to calibration offsets .",
    "variations in the parameters used for the native source model , such as the co lifetime and outlow velocity , could also change the production rate by a few percent . other less quantifiable uncertainties to which the fluorescence model is particularly sensitive are the oscillator strengths and the uv solar flux , especially due to the variable emission features at high solar activity .",
    "overall , we estimate that the systematic errors in the production rates amount to at most 15% .    to assess the effects of the error sources mentioned above , it is useful to compare our results to other measurements of the co production rate in these comets from different spectral regions .",
    "the values obtained for comets c/2000 wm@xmath2 ( linear ) and c/1996 b2 ( hyakutake ) are in excellent agreement with previous measurements . for comet",
    "c/1996 b2 ( hyakutake ) at similar heliocentric distances @xcite find vales of @xmath92  molecules  s@xmath8 ( 0.952  au ) and @xmath93  molecules  s@xmath8 ( 0.894  au ) .",
    "the production rate relative to water is comparable to previously measured mixing ratios of 14 to 19% @xcite and 22% @xcite .",
    "for comet c/2000 wm@xmath2 ( linear ) both @xmath16 @xcite and radio @xcite observations are consistent with a co mixing ratio of @xmath300.4% and a co production rate of @xmath303 to 4@xmath1710@xmath94  molecules  s@xmath8 .",
    "a good agreement is again found when comparing the co production rate derived for comet c/2001 q4 ( neat ) with the results from @xmath16 observations ( @xmath95 4.1.2 ) , listed in table  [ table3 ] .",
    "we note that the measurements based on @xmath16 observations used only the cold component of co ( see @xmath95  4.1.2 ) in estimating the co production rate . the cold component is believed to reflect the native source of co , which is directly probed by stis .",
    "the two values agree marginally within the error bars , and the mismatch can be attributed to short time variability and pointing instability for the @xmath16 observations .",
    "the count rates for the @xmath20 band in the @xmath16 data show factor of two variations with a periodicity of @xmath3020 hours .",
    "the @xmath16 observation overlaps with a much shorter stis exposure , but the exact correlation in comet activity between the two datasets is hard to assess due to the different fields of view of the two instruments .    for comet 153p / ikeya - zhang",
    "the derived co production rate is about a factor of 2 higher than the estimate from the range of values given by @xcite ( using the @xmath96 scaling , see table  [ table3 ] ) and @xcite .",
    "the factor of two difference may be attributed to the uncertainties in the model parameters ( rotational temperature and doppler parameter ) and in the background subtraction . however , as discussed above , the combined sources of error should result in less than 15% uncertainty . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath96 dependence was derived from two measurements , one at 0.51  au and the other at 1.26  au , not excluding the possibility of temporal variations affecting our observations at 0.89  au . moreover , the uncertainties in the @xmath96 scaling have not been quantified , making our value for the production rate more reliable .",
    "the co abundance relative to water is again higher than other estimates .",
    "however , using the water production rate given by the 19.0@xmath1710@xmath97  molecules  s@xmath8 dependence derived by @xcite from h@xmath59o observations made by the _ odin _",
    "satellite @xcite , the co mixing ratio decreases from @xmath57 to @xmath98 .",
    "this would place the co relative abundance in comet 153p / ikeya - zhang closer to the value of @xmath99 at @xmath301  au @xcite and @xmath100 at 0.78  au @xcite .",
    "the advantage of long - slit spectroscopy with stis resides in giving us a better understanding of the spatial distribution of co and the effects of increasing optical depths on the observed line ratios .",
    "we show how this information is applicable to broad - band imaging by integrating the brightness of the @xmath3 bands in the stis bandpass that are not contaminated by atomic lines .",
    "we then integrate the fluorescence model over the same bands deriving an equivalent g - factor ( as a ratio between the total brightness and the column density ) .",
    "given the specific optical depth corrections in our model , the resulting g - factor will be in fact a brightness - column density dependence rather than a globally constant ratio .",
    "the radial brightness profile of the integrated bands observed by stis can be then converted into a column density profile .",
    "this procedure can be visualized in figure  [ izot ] , where the data for comet 153p / ikeya - zhang have been used .",
    "the brightness profile has been rebinned in 1  bins and background subtracted .",
    "the red histogram represents the column density profile obtained using the optically thick brightness - wavelength dependence , while the blue histogram represents the column density profile obtained in the optically thin approximation , using a constant g - factor .",
    "the black line is the native source model integrated in 1  @xmath17  02 bins , for a production rate of 1.54@xmath1710@xmath81  molecules  s@xmath8 , as derived in   4.1.1 .",
    "this figure illustrates the importance of including optical depth effects in order to predict the correct column density .",
    "this method has been used to interpret the imaging data from the _ hst _ solar blind channel of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs / sbc ) , and give an estimate of the number of molecules released from comet 9p / tempel  1 as a result of the _ deep impact _",
    "encounter @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties in this type of measurements come mainly from the additional emission features of atomic lines in the bandpass .",
    "the @xmath1-stis observations allow us to constrain the dominant source of co in the region probed by the 25  @xmath17  02 slit . reconstructing the surface column density distribution from the radial profile we estimate that in a 10  @xmath17  10  box the native source contribution to the total number of molecules is as high as 80% for comet",
    "c/2000 wm@xmath2 ( linear ) and from 90% to 99% for comets c/2001 q4 ( neat ) and 153p / ikeya - zhang , respectively .",
    "this result suggests that the native source dominates in the inner @xmath101  km from the comet center , while the extended component becomes important at larger distances .",
    "however , the native co observed in the coma is linked to the amount of co in the nucleus through the outgassing mechanism , which is not well known .",
    "laboratory data suggests that the abundance of co relative to water in the ice can be a factor of 5 to 10 lower than the one observed in the coma @xcite .",
    "the exact value depends on the temperature at which the comet is outgassing .",
    "the large variation in the co production rate relative to water can be understood from the large range of heliocentric distances over which the comets have formed and then migrated to the outer parts of the solar system through gravitational interactions with the planets . the observed diversity among comets is thought to be related to the local gas and dust composition and temperature where they formed .",
    "under the assumption that co has been trapped by water ice during comet formation , the local temperature can be estimated from the observed production rate @xcite .",
    "the formation temperatures in our sample are expected to range from 50  k or less for comets c/2001 q4 , 153p / ikeya - zhang and hyakutake , to more than 60  k for c/2000 wm@xmath2 .",
    "if the gas trapping mechanism is more efficient than deposition , as suggested by laboratory studies of co and water interactions @xcite , important enrichments for the species with a higher sublimation temperature can occur @xcite .",
    "this can explain the lack of correlation between the abundance of co and that of other molecules with a similar sublimation temperature @xcite .",
    "we have developed a fluorescence model for the interpretation of co @xmath3 emission observed in several recent comets by the _ hubble space telescope _ employing the latest values for the transition wavelengths and oscillator strengths .",
    "the radiative transfer approximation takes into account saturation effects using voigt profiles for each of the @xmath3010@xmath102 transitions .",

    "the approximations in the radiative transfer model are justified for the quality of the available data .",
    "constraining better the optical depth effects demands an exact treatment , which would be warranted at higher spectral resolution in order to predict the relative strengths of individual lines contained in the @xmath3 bands .",
