    "the unification of the three gauge couplings of the strong and electroweak interactions at a scale @xmath1gev in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is the strongest argument for the existence of a unifying grand unification at this high scale @xcite .",
    "the minimal simple gauge groups containing @xmath2 are @xmath0 and @xmath3 . besides the mssm particles , these contain extra ones which have to receive a mass in the process of breaking the gut gauge group . for a georgi - glashow @xmath0 gut theory @xcite , there exist in particular the @xmath4 and @xmath5 gauge bosons and in addition a vector - like pair of higgs triplets @xmath6 which combine with the weak higgs doublet into the @xmath7 representation .",
    "combining the idea of a unification of gauge couplings with the unification of the gravitational interaction seems to be quite natural , as the gut scale and planck - scale @xmath8gev are not so far apart .",
    "concrete examples for such a unification naturally arise from string theory , where a compactification of for instance the @xmath9 ten - dimensional heterotic string on a calabi - yau threefold @xmath10 can lead to a four - dimensional effective field theory with @xmath11 supersymmetry and gauge group @xmath0 or @xmath3 .",
    "since in most these string models there does not exist a light adjoint higgs field , one has to implement an alternative mechanism by which the gut gauge group is broken . in most cases",
    "this is done by turning on discrete wilson lines supported on homologically non - trivial 1-cycles in the internal compact manifold .",
    "very recently , in the context of f - theory resp .",
    "type iib orientifold compactifications a different possibility has been made very concrete @xcite . here",
    "the @xmath0 gauge group is supported on a stack of @xmath12 branes wrapping a surface in the internal calabi - yau manifold @xmath10 .",
    "the three generations of chiral matter in the @xmath13 representation are localised on curves where the gut brane intersects other branes .",
    "the same happens for the higgs field @xmath7 which is also localised on such a curve .",
    "the gut surface is chosen to be rigid , i.e. it is a del - pezzo surface , so that there are no candidate @xmath0 adjoint higgs fields . moreover",
    ", a del - pezzo surface does not admit any discrete wilson line .",
    "similar to earlier considerations for the heterotic string @xcite , this leaves a third possibility to break the @xmath0 gauge group @xcite .",
    "one can turn on an internal gauge flux @xmath14 with values in the @xmath15 .",
    "one can describe this flux as a connection on some line bundle @xmath16 , whose structure group breaks the @xmath0 to the sm gauge group .",
    "usually , this would lead to stckelberg masses for the four - dimensional hypercharge gauge field .",
    "however , if the @xmath15 flux is localised on a non - trivial two - cycle in the del - pezzo , which is trivial when considered as a two - cycle in calabi - yau , the mass mixing with the axions can be avoided and the final gauge group is indeed @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for more details on such local f - theory models or to @xcite for the realisation on compact type iib orientifolds .",
    "a couple of phenomenological features of such models , like yukawa textures @xcite and supersymmetry breaking @xcite , have been investigated recently .",
    "it is the aim of this letter to analyse the important issue of gauge coupling unification for such f - theory / iib orientifold @xmath0 gut models in more detail . employing the formalism and notation put forward in @xcite ,",
    "all computations are carried out in the type iib orientifold framework though they should carry over mutatis mutandis to the more general f - theory framework .",
    "the main new issue here is the presence of the @xmath15 flux , which at first sight causes a serious problem , in that it splits the values of the three mssm gauge couplings at the string resp .",
    "unification scale .",
    "this might spoil the beautiful unification of these couplings shown in figure [ figa ] .",

    "let us assume that in either a local or a global model we have identified a del - pezzo surface @xmath24 on which we can wrap five d7-branes supporting a @xmath25 gauge group .",
    "this surface is embedded into the calabi - yau as @xmath26 . as shown in @xcite , via the freed - witten gauge flux quantisation condition , the fact that the del - pezzo is non-_spin _ implies that these d7-branes must support a non - trivial line bundle @xmath27 . in the following",
    "we will choose this line bundle to come from a restriction of a line bundle on @xmath10 , i.e. @xmath28 .    the matter fields @xmath29 result from intersections of this @xmath0 brane with its orientifold image respectively a second single brane wrapping a divisor @xmath30 which supports a line bundle @xmath31 . in f - theory",
    "these matter fields are described as enhancements of the @xmath0 degeneration of the elliptic fiber of the fourfold to @xmath3 resp .",
    "@xmath32 along certain matter curves .",
    "now , one breaks the @xmath0 gut theory by turning on a non - trivial @xmath15 flux @xmath16 supported on a two - cycle on the del - pezzo surface which is however trivial in the calabi - yau , i.e. @xmath33 .",
    "clearly , if the breaking of the @xmath0 is such that below the breaking scale one has precisely the mssm matter , the running of the gauge couplings is such that at the one - loop level they unify at @xmath34gev .",
    "the most natural scenario is that one identifies the gut scale with the string scale .",
    "let us consider the tree - level gauge couplings at the string scale .",

    ", we have to choose a line bundle @xmath16 supported on the @xmath51 sublattice of @xmath57 with @xmath58 .",
    "in other words , @xmath59 has to correspond to a root of @xmath51 .",
    "we expect the masses of the lightest such states to be of order @xmath60 . turning on this @xmath0 symmetry breaking flux , for finite @xmath61 the gauge couplings at the string scale @xmath62 do not unify any longer .",
    "one might be tempted that this could explain the 4% deviation from mssm gauge coupling unification at the 2-loop level @xcite . however , for f - theory / iib orientifold guts the order of the gauge couplings at the string scale is [ rela ] 1_s(m_s ) < 35 _",
    "y(m_s ) < 1 _ w(m_s ) , which never occurs in @xcite for any value of the scale @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , we seem to have a serious problem with gauge coupling unification in this class of gut models .",
    "as shown in the last section , at the string scale we find the relation [ relb ] _ 13=35 _ 23 for @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "intriguingly , this can also be written as    [ relc ] 1_y(m_s)=1_w(m_s ) + 23 _ s(m_s ) , a relation which has already appeared for gauge couplings in more general standard model like four stack intersecting d6-brane models @xcite(see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is clear that , in order to have any chance that running up the low - energy couplings to the string scale , they satisfy relation ( [ rela ] ) and ( [ relb ] ) , there must exist a new threshold in between .",
    "these new charged states must contribute to the running such that it creates a region for @xmath63 , where the order of the gauge couplings is like in ( [ rela ] ) .",
    "recall that prior to gut symmetry breaking , there were the higgs fields @xmath66 and that the @xmath15 bundle was chosen such that the doublets remain massless and the triplets become massive , i.e. [ higgscohoms ] h^*(c , l^-1_a_bk^12_c ) & = & ( 0,0 ) + h^*(c ,",

    "@xmath67 denotes the curve @xmath68 supporting the higgs fields and @xmath69 its canonical line bundle . in the case",
    "that the higgs field is localised on a curve of genus one , the mass of the triplet is determined by a non - trivial wilson line originating from the reduction of the line bundles on the genus one curve .",
    "these states have masses smaller than the kaluza - klein scale @xmath60 , which we assume to be ( slightly ) smaller than the order of the string scale . in @xcite a second option was discussed , where the two higgs fields are localised on different curves , so that via ( [ higgscohoms ] ) the masses of the triplets come from pairings of @xmath70 with other fields respectively .",
    "this allows to suppress dimension five proton decay operators .",
    "therefore , these colour triplets @xmath71 are the distinguished natural candidates to change the running of the gauge couplings at a scale @xmath72 and we treat their mass scale as a parameter @xmath73 for the following analysis .    above this new threshold",

    "for analysing what happens around the gut scale , we have to look more closely at the running of the gauge couplings between the threshold @xmath75 and the gut scale .",

    "let us summarise the main observations made in this letter :    * the breaking of the @xmath0 gut via a non - trivial @xmath15 flux leads to a splitting of the three mssm gauge couplings at the string / gut scale [ onerelation ] 1_y(m_s)=1_w(m_s ) + 23_s(m_s ) , thus spoiling the usual gauge coupling unification .",
    "* if the higgs triplet @xmath80 is lighter than the gut scale , this threshold changes the one - loop running of the gauge couplings such that they satisfy this f - theory gut relation at @xmath81 independent of the value of the threshold scale . * in this case , from eq .",
    "( [ gaugekins ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ running ] ) and @xmath59 being a root of @xmath51 , one can derive the following two additional relations with @xmath82 [ stringrelat ] 1g_s=12 ( m_xm_33 ) , ( _ xg_s)^14    if the appearance of baryon number violating dim@xmath83 operators @xmath84 forces us to choose @xmath75 of the order of @xmath81 , we get @xmath85 , i.e. we are driven to the strong coupling regime , where f - theory is expected to be the appropriate description and where for @xmath86 all corrections in ( [ gaugekins ] ) become negligible small .",
    "however , if there exists a mechanism to suppress these dangerous @xmath84 operators , @xmath75 can be significantly smaller than @xmath81 , while gauge coupling f - unification still holds .",
    "for @xmath87 gev we even get @xmath88 with @xmath89 .",
    "recall that in field theory guts one gets two relations among the gauge coupling constants at the gut scale leading to one prediction for the couplings at the weak scale . in the f - theory case , one has instead only one direct relation among the gauge couplings ( [ onerelation ] ) at the string scale , which already suffices to fix the gut scale .",
    "in addition one finds one relation among the string parameters @xmath61 and @xmath75 . if for a concrete string model one has prior knowledge that this relation holds , we also have one prediction among the gauge couplings at @xmath90 .",
    "in the more general scheme with @xmath61 and @xmath75 treated as adjustable parameters f - theory is less predictive than a field theory gut .",
    "from the observation made in this letter one can draw two not unrelated conclusions .",
    "first , it shows the robustness of the @xmath0 gauge breaking mechanism by a @xmath15 flux .",
    "the shift in the string scale gauge couplings can be reconciled precisely by the running of the higgs triplet below the string scale .",
    "second , in all @xmath0 gut models with the mass of the higgs triplet significantly below the gut scale , unification at @xmath1gev requires the f - theory like split ( [ relc ] ) in the gut scale gauge couplings .    finally , it is amusing that by writing equation ( [ stringrelat ] ) as @xmath91 it looks , as if the higgs triplet gets its dominant mass from a @xmath92-brane instanton .",
