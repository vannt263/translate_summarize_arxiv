    "uranium , as the most predominant light actinide , has attracted considerable interests experimentally@xcite and theoretically@xcite in both of its bulk@xcite and surface@xcite states due to the dual nature@xcite of its 5f electrons .",
    "an experimentally detected sharp peak at 2.3 ev below the fermi energy ( @xmath2 ) for a thin foil of @xmath0-u revealed that the 5f electrons could be nearly localized at the surface of this system@xcite .",
    "however , it was very soon realized that the peak was originated from the 6d valence band emission due to the exposure of uranium surfaces to o@xmath3 which conversely implied an itinerant behavior for the 5f - electrons at the u surface@xcite .",
    "a dispersive behavior was also found@xcite for the u 5f states and attributed to the direct f - f interaction , which excellently verified the band - like feature of the 5f u states reported in ref .",
    "furthermore , the first preformed scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiment to observe 5f states@xcite for the evaporated well ordered uranium films up to 80    on the w(110 ) crystal at room temperature reconfirmed that the 5f electrons would not be considered as localized electrons .",
    "therefor , according to the aforementioned experimental evidences,@xcite we do not treat @xmath0-u / w(110 ) thin films ( tfs ) as a strongly correlated system in this work , which effectively saves the time of calculations in our ab initio surface calculations .",

    "the source of the later difference may not be only due to the proximity effect of the substrate , as further increase in vertical spacing of d@xmath16 does not affect the result substantially .",

    "in addition to the in - plane lattice mismatches and the proximity effects of the substrate , vertical lattice mismatch of the substrate can be also of significant importance in this 5f system .",

    "[ tab4 ] , do not manifest considerable magnetism even by moving upwards the u1 overlayer from the nonmagnetic substrate .",

    "the contraction for the 3u/7w(110 ) is 15.7% between u3 and u2 and 13.2% between u2 and u1 .",
    "the contractions can cause a stronger direct interaction between 5f states of two vertically adjacent uranium atoms .",

    "[ fig2 ]  ( d ) , we see that , in complete accord with experiments@xcite , most of the total - dos is dominated by the 5f states in the vicinity of the @xmath2 . in order to authenticate the above discussion we have calculated the band structures of 1u/7w(110 ) , 2u/7w(110 ) and 3u/7w(110 ) systems .",

    "such an increase in the number of splitted 5f bands in the 3u / w(110 ) can be taken as more interactions among 5f electrons of the uranium atoms in this system .",

    "this is in the case that for the freestanding @xmath0-u(001 ) tfs , the magnetism is preserved but its magnitude decreases by adding one more uranium layer . the disappearance of the magnetism in 2u/7w(110 ) is attributed to the contraction of the uranium ils , which can be originated from the w(110 ) substrate .",
    "the contraction can give rise to stronger direct 5f-5f interactions .",
    "our calculation shows that the 5f u dos is more broadened in 2u/7w(110 ) or 3u/7w(110 ) compared to the ultrathin 1u/7w(110 ) film .",

    "<S> structural , electronic and magnetic properties were calculated for the optimized @xmath0-u / w(110 ) thin films ( tfs ) within the density functional theory . </S>",

    "<S> spin and orbital magnetic moments ( mms ) per u atom were found to be enhanced from zero for the bulk of @xmath0-u to 1.4 @xmath1 and -0.4 @xmath1 at the interface of the 1u/7w(110 ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> inversely , our result for 3u/7w(110 ) tfs shows that the surface u - u ils is contracted by 15.7% compared to our obtained bulk u - u spacing . </S>",
    "<S> the enhanced spin and orbital mms in the 1u/7w(110 ) were then found to be suppressed in 3u/7w(110 ) to their ignorable bulk values . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated density of states ( dos ) corroborates the enhancement and suppression of the mms and shows that the total dos , in agreement with experiment , is dominated in the vicinity of fermi level by the 5f u states . </S>",
    "<S> proximity and mismatch effects of the nonmagnetic w(110 ) substrate were assessed and found to be important for this system . </S>"
