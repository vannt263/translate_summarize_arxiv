    "we evolved solar models using both the lawrence livermore national laboratory opal opacities ( @xcite ) and the new los alamos atomic opacities , for the agss09 ( @xcite ) solar abundance mixture .",
    "we adjusted the initial helium mass fraction ( y ) , initial mass fraction of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium ( z ) , and mixing - length to pressure - scale - height ratio ( @xmath1 ) to calibrate the model to the observed solar luminosity and radius at the current solar age , as well as to the observed z / x ratio of the agss09 abundances ( see @xcite for details of the modeling procedure ) .",

    "the sound - speed agreement is slightly better for the model using the new lanl atomic opacities compared to that using the llnl opal opacities .",
    "we found similar results for models evolved with the mesa code ( @xcite ) using the same opacity tables and abundance mixture .",
    "figure [ o - c ] shows the observed minus calculated vs. calculated low - degree nonadiabatic solar oscillation frequencies for the two models , also showing slightly improved agreement using the atomic opacities compared to the opal opacities .",
    "for the same temperature , density , and abundance mixture , the atomic opacities are actually lower in the radiative interior than the opal opacities , although they are higher than the opal opacities for conditions in the solar convective envelope that do not affect the solar structure since convection is transporting nearly all of the solar luminosity .",
    "it turns out that the difference in opacity _ derivatives _ between opal and atomic for solar interior conditions is responsible for the difference in solar structure .",
    "figure [ gradient ] shows that the opacity derivative with respect to temperature for the atomic opacities is steeper at log t = 6.3 ( cz base ) than that of the opal opacities , resulting in a slightly deeper convection zone and change in the sound - speed gradient at the convection - zone base .",
    "in addition , the opacity derivative is steeper at log t= 6.8 ( solar radius @xmath90.2 - 0.3 r@xmath0 ) , also changing the sound - speed gradient at this location .",

    "we would like to investigate the effects of atomic opacities on other types of pulsating stars , as has been done recently for b stars ( walczak et al .",
