    "the most fundamental difference between classical and quantum information is that while classical information can be copied perfectly , quantum information can not",
    ". in particular , it follows from the _ no - cloning theorem _",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) that one can not create a perfect duplicate of an _ arbitrary _ qubit . for example , using the well - known _ teleportation protocol _",
    "@xcite , one can create a perfect copy of the original qubit but this will be at the expense of the _ complete _ destruction of information encoded in the original qubit .",
    "in contrast , the main goal of quantum copying is to produce a copy of the original qubit which is as close as possible to the original state while the output state of the original qubit is minimally disturbed .",
    "we have shown recently @xcite that if one is only interested in producing imperfect copies , then it is possible to make quantum clones of the original qubit . to be specific : the copy machine considered by wootters and zurek @xcite in their proof of the no - cloning theorem , for example , produces two identical copies at its output , but the quality of these copies depends upon the input state .",
    "they are perfect for the basis vectors which we denote as @xmath2 and @xmath3 , but , because the copying process destroys the off - diagonal information of the input density matrix , they are poor for input states of the form @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is arbitrary .",
    "we have introduced @xcite a different copying machine , the universal quantum copying machine ( uqcm ) , which produces two identical copies whose quality is _ independent _ of the input state .",
    "in addition , its performance is , on average , better than that of the wootters - zurek machine , and the action of the machine simply scales the expectation values of relevant observables .",
    "this uqcm was shown to be optimal , in the sense that it maximizes the average fidelity between the input and output qubits , by gisin and massar @xcite and by bruet al .",
    "gisin and massar have also been able to find copying transformations which produce @xmath1 copies from @xmath6 originals ( where @xmath7 ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , we have proposed quantum logic newtworks for quantum copying machines @xcite , and bounds have been placed on how good copies can be @xcite .    in this talk",
    "we will firstly review our original ideas on universal quantum copying of a single qubit ( section ii ) . in section iii",
    "we will present a quantum network describing the uqcm .",
    "secondly , in section iv we will introduce the copying machine which produces @xmath0 identical copies from the original qubit .",
    "the quality ( fidelity ) of copies does not depend on the state of the original and is only a function of a number @xmath1 of produced copies .",
    "we present a quantum network for the quantum copying machine .",
    "we show that this machine is formally described by the same unitary transformation as recently introduced by gisin and massar @xcite . in section v we will analyze properties of multiply cloned qubits .",
    "thirdly , in section vi we show how quantum registers ( i.e. systems composed of many entangled qubits ) can be universally cloned .",
    "to be specific , one approach is to use the single - qubit copiers to copy individually ( locally ) each qubit .",
    "we have shown earlier @xcite that in the case of two qubits this local copying will preserve some of quantum correlations between qubits , but as we will show , it does not make a particularly good copy of the two - qubit state . as an alternative we propose a copy machine which universally ( and optimally ) clones quantum states in arbitrary - dimensional hilbert spaces .",
    "this allow us to discuss optimal cloning of quantum registers .",
    "let us assume we want to copy an arbitrary pure state @xmath8 which in a particular basis @xmath9 is described by the state vector @xmath8 @xmath10 the two numbers which characterize the state ( [ 1.1 ] ) can be associated with the `` amplitude '' @xmath11 and the `` phase '' @xmath5 of the qubit .",
    "even though ideal copying , i.e. , the transformation @xmath12 ) , it is still possible to design quantum copiers which operate reasonably well . in particular , the uqcm @xcite is specified by the following conditions .    * ( i)*the state of the original system and its quantum copy at the output of the quantum copier , described by density operators @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively , are identical , i.e. , @xmath15    * ( ii ) * if no _ a priori _ information about the _ in_-state of the original system is available , then it is reasonable to require that _ all _ pure states should be copied equally well .",
    "one way to implement this assumption is to design a quantum copier such that the distances between density operators of each system at the output ( @xmath16 where @xmath17 ) and the ideal density operator @xmath18 which describes the _ in_-state of the original mode are input state independent .",
    "quantitatively this means that if we employ the bures distance @xcite @xmath19 as a measure of distance between two operators , then the quantum copier should be such that @xmath20    * ( iii ) * finally , we would also like to require that the copies are as close as possible to the ideal output state , which is , of course , just the input state .",
    "this means that we want our quantum copying transformation to minimize the distance between the output state @xmath21 of the copied qubit and the ideal state @xmath22 .",
    "the distance is minimized with respect to all possible unitary transformations @xmath23 acting on the hilbert space @xmath24 of two qubits and the quantum copying machine ( i.e. , @xmath25 ) @xmath26 originally , the uqcm was found by analyzing a transformation which contained two free parameters , and then determining them by demanding that condition ( ii ) be satisfied , and that the distance between the two - qubit output density matrix and the ideal two - qubit output be input state independent . that the uqcm machine obeys the condition ( [ 1.6 ] )",
    "has only been shown recently @xcite .",
    "the unitary transformation which implements the uqcm @xcite is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 , and satisfies the conditions ( [ 1.3]-[1.6 ] ) .",
    "the system labelled by @xmath29 is the original ( input ) qubit , while the other system @xmath30 represents the qubit onto which the information is copied .",
    "this qubit is supposed to be prepared initially in a state @xmath31 ( the `` blank paper '' in a copier ) .",
    "the states of the copy machine are labelled by @xmath32 .",
    "the state space of the copy machine is two dimensional , and we assume that it is always in the same state @xmath33 initially .",
    "if the original qubit is in the superposition state ( [ 1.1 ] ) then the reduced density operator of both copies at the output are equal [ see condition ( [ 1.3 ] ) ] and they can be expressed as @xmath34 where @xmath35 , is the state orthogonal to @xmath36 .",
    "this implies that the copy contains @xmath37 of the state we want and @xmath38 of the one we do not .",
    "the density operator @xmath39 given by eq.([1.9 ] ) can be rewritten in a `` scaled '' form : @xmath40 which guarantees that the distance ( [ 1.4 ] ) is input - state independent , i.e. the condition ( [ 1.5 ] is automatically fulfilled . the scaling factor in eq.([1.11 ] ) is @xmath41 ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "we note that once again that the uqcm copies all input states with the same quality and therefore is suitable for copying when no _ a priori _ information about the state of the original qubit is available .",
    "this corresponds to a uniform prior probability distribution on the state space of a qubit ( poincare sphere ) .",
    "correspondingly , one can measure the quality of copies by the fidelity @xmath42 , which is equal to the mean overlap between a copy and the input state @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",
    "it is easy to show that the relation between the fidelity @xmath42 and the scaling factor is @xmath45 .",
    "in what follows we show how , with simple quantum logic gates , we can copy quantum information encoded in the original qubit onto other qubits .",
    "the copying procedure can be understood as a `` spread '' of information via a `` controlled '' entanglement between the original qubit and the copy qubits .",
    "this controlled entanglement is implemented by a sequence of controlled - not operations operating on the original qubit and the copy qubits which are initially prepared in a specific state .    in designing a network for the uqcm",
    "we first note that since the state space of the copy machine itself is two dimensional , we can consider it to be an additional qubit .",
    "our network , then , will take 3 input qubits ( one for the input , one which becomes one the copy , and one for the machine ) and transform them into 3 output qubits . in what follows",
    "we will denote the quantum copier qubit as @xmath46 rather than @xmath32 .",
    "the operation of this network is such , that in order to transfer information from the original @xmath29 qubit to the target qubit @xmath30 we will need one _ idle _ qubit @xmath46 which plays the role of quantum copier .    before proceeding with the network itself",
    "let us specify the one and two - qubit gates from which it will be constructed .",
    "firstly we define a single - qubit rotation @xmath47 which acts on the basis vectors of qubits as @xmath48    we also will utilize a two - qubit operator ( a two - bit quantum gate ) , the so - called controlled - not gate , which has as its inputs a control qubit ( denoted as @xmath49 in fig.1 ) and a target qubit ( denoted as @xmath50 in fig.1 ) .",
    "the control qubit is unaffected by the action of the gate , and if the control qubit is @xmath2 , the target qubit is unaffected as well . however ,",
    "if the control qubit is in the @xmath3 state , then a not operation is performed on the target qubit .",
    "the operator which implements this gate , @xmath51 , acts on the basis vectors of the two qubits as follows ( @xmath52 denotes the control qubit and @xmath53 the target ) : @xmath54    we can decompose the quantum copier network into two parts . in the first part",
    "the copy ( @xmath30 ) and the idle ( @xmath46 ) qubits are prepared in a specific state @xmath55 . then in the second part of the copying network the original information from the original qubit @xmath29 is _ redistributed _ among the three qubits .",
    "that is the action of the quantum copier can be described as a sequence of two unitary transformations @xmath56 the network for the quantum copying machine is displayed in fig .  1 .",
    "let us first look at the preparation stage .",
    "prior to any interaction with the input qubit we have to prepare the two quantum copier qubits ( @xmath30 and @xmath46 ) in a specific state @xmath55 @xmath57 which can be prepared by a simple quantum network ( see the `` preparation '' box in fig.1 ) with two controlled - nots @xmath51 and three rotations @xmath58 , i.e. @xmath59 with the rotation angles defined as @xcite @xmath60      once the qubits of the quantum copier are properly prepared then the copying of the initial state @xmath61 of the original qubit can be performed by a sequence of four controlled - not operations ( see fig .",
    "1 ) @xmath62 when this operation is combined with the preparation stage , we find that the basis states of the original qubit ( @xmath29 ) are copied as described by eq.([1.7 ] ) with @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "when the original qubit is in the superposition state ( [ 1.1 ] ) then the state vector of the three qubits after the copying has been performed reads @xmath65 with @xmath66 from this it follows that at the output of the quantum copier we find a pair of entangled qubits in a state described by the density operator @xmath67 each of the copy qubits at the output of the quantum copier has a reduced density operator @xmath21 ( @xmath17 ) given by eq.([1.11 ] ) .",
    "the bures distance @xmath68 ( @xmath17 ) between the output qubit and the ideal qubit is constant and it reads @xmath69    we note , that the idle qubit after the copying is performed is in a state @xmath70 where the superscript t denotes the transpose .    finally we note that the flow of quantum information in our network can be effectively controled by the choice of the preparation of the quantum copier .",
    "that is , we can a priori decide which qubits at the output will be clones of the original qubit @xcite .",
    "here we present a generalization of the transformation ( [ 1.7 ] ) to the case when a set of @xmath1 copy qubits @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) are produced out of the original qubit @xmath29 .",
    "we also present a simple quantum network which realizes this multiple quantum copying @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "we already know that ideal multiple copying of the form @xmath74 does not exist .",
    "but , as we shall show , one can generalize the copying procedure described in section iii , and find a transformation such that @xmath75 with the distances @xmath76 [ see eq.([1.4 ] ) ] which do not depend on the initial state ( [ 1.1 ] ) of the original qubit .    to find the @xmath77 network we assume the following : we assume that the information from the original qubit is copied to @xmath1 copy qubits @xmath71 which are initially prepared in the state @xmath78 is a vector in the hilbert space of @xmath1 qubits @xmath71 ) .",
    "to implement multiple quantum copying we need to associate an _ idle _",
    "qubit @xmath79 with each copy qubit , @xmath71 .",
    "these @xmath1 idle qubits , which play the role of the copying machine itself , are initially prepared in the state @xmath80 .",
    "once this is done the copying is performed by a simple sequence of controlled - not operations .      in order to find the explicit form for the quantum network for @xmath81 copying we introduce normalized state vectors @xmath82 describing a _",

    "@xmath92 we also introduce the operator @xmath93 describing the controlled - not process with @xmath29 playing the role of the target qubit , i.e. @xmath94    now we find the @xmath77 copying network to be @xmath95 where the @xmath96 qubit output of the copying process is described by the state vector @xmath97 which is defined as @xmath98 this last equation describes a simple quantum network when firstly the original qubit controls the target qubits of the quantum copier .",
    "then the qubits @xmath99 and @xmath100 `` control '' the state of the original qubit via another sequence of controlled - nots ( see fig.2 ) . in this way one can produce out of a single original qubit a set of quantum clones .",
    "using the explicit expression for the output state @xmath97 we find that the original and the copy qubits at the output of the quantum copier are in the same state described by the density operator @xmath101 where the scaling factor @xmath102 depends on the number @xmath1 of copies , i.e. @xmath103 which corresponds to the fidelity @xmath104 .",
    "we see that this result for @xmath105 reduces to the case of the uqcm discussed in section iii .",
    "we also note that in the limit @xmath106 , i.e. when an infinite number of copies is _ simultaneously _ produced via the generalization of the uqcm , the copy qubits still carry information about the original qubit , because their density operators are given by the relation @xmath107 which corresponds to the fidelity @xmath108 .",
    "this is the optimal fidelity achievable when an _ optimal _ measurement is performed on a single qubit @xcite . from this point of view one can consider quantum copying as a transformation of quantum information into classical information @xcite .",
    "this also suggests that quantum copying can be utilized to obtain novel insights into the quantum theory of measurement [ e.g. , a simultaneous measurement of conjugated observables on two copies of the original qubit ; or a specific realization of the generalized ( povm ) measurement performed on the original qubit .    * comment 1*we note that if the original qubit is copied sequentially by a system of @xmath1 copying machines of the type @xmath109 ( each machine copies two outcomes of the previous copier ) then @xmath110 copies of the original qubit in the limit @xmath106 are in the state @xmath111 . in this case the copied qubits do not carry information about the original qubit , while all idle qubits are in the state ( [ 2.18 ] ) .",

    "it is required for a violation of bell s inequality ( to be specific , a separable system always satisfy bell s inequality , but the contrary is not necessarily true ) .",
    "distant parties can not prepare an inseparable state from a separable one if they only use local operations and classical communication . in the case of two spins-1/2",

    "[ 16 ] this is again and increasing function of @xmath6 which reflects the fact that the copies and the copier become increasingly correlated as @xmath6 increases . on the other hand , it follows from the araki - lieb theorem that the maximum value of the entropy of two entangled subsystems with the dimension of the smaller subsystem being @xmath6 , is equal to @xmath169 , which shows that the cloner and the clones are far from being maximally entangled .      finally , we would like to compare two methods of copying of quantum registers . in particular , we consider cloning of an entangled state of two qubits .",
    "we assume that the two qubits are prepared in the state    taken @xmath142 and @xmath143 to be real , and @xmath170 .",
    "first , we shall consider the case in which each of the two qubits @xmath29 and @xmath171 is copied _ locally _ by two independent quantum copiers @xcite .",
    "each of these two copiers is described by the transformation in eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) with @xmath161 .",
    "next , we shall consider a _",
    "nonlocal _ cloning of the two - qubit state in eq .",
    "( [ 17 ] ) when this system is cloned via the unitary transformation in eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) with @xmath172 , i.e. the cloner in this case can act non - locally on the two qubits .",
    "our chief task will be analyze how inseparability is cloned in these two scenarios , but we shall also examine the quality of the copies which are produced in the two cases . from the peres - horodecki theorem it follows that the state in eq .",
    "( [ 17 ] ) is inseparable for all values of @xmath173 such that @xmath174 .",
    "now suppose that each of the two original qubits @xmath29 and @xmath171 is cloned by two independent local cloners @xmath175 and @xmath176 , each described by the transformation in eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) with @xmath161 .",
    "the cloner @xmath175 ( @xmath176 ) generates out of qubit @xmath29 ( @xmath171 ) two qubits @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( @xmath171 and @xmath46 ) . after we perform trace over the two cloners we obtain a four - qubit density operator @xmath177 which also describes two nonlocal two - qubit systems , i.e. @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "these two two - qubit systems are the clones of the original two - qubit register ( [ 17 ] ) and they are described by the density operators @xcite ^(out)_a_0b_1 = ^(out)_a_1b_0 = |0000| + |1111| + ( |0101|+|1010| ) + ( |0011|+|1100| ) . [ 21 ] we first note that this density matrix can not be expressed in the scaled form of eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) , and that the quality fo the copies depends on the input state .",
    "therefore , this procedure does not produce a universal quantum copy machine . from the peres - horodecki theorem we immediately find that the density operators in eq .",
    "( [ 21 ] ) are inseparable if -^2 + .",
    "[ 22 ] this proves that for a restricted set of pure two - qubit states ( [ 17 ] ) , those which satisfy the condition in eq .",
    "( [ 22 ] ) , it is possible to _ locally _ copy them so that their original inseparability is ( partially ) preserved .",
    "let us now see what happens when we copy the entire two - qubit register at once .",
    "we would like to determine whether the set of original two - qubit states ( see eq .",
    "( [ 17 ] ) ) , which after the cloning exhibit inseparability , is larger ( i.e. , the restriction of the form given in eq . (",
    "[ 22 ] ) is weaker ) than when a nonlocal cloning is performed .",
    "to do so , we introduce four basis vectors @xmath180 ; @xmath181 ; @xmath182 ; and @xmath183 , so that the original two - qubit state in eq .",
    "( [ 17 ] ) is expressed as @xmath184 .",
    "the copying is now performed according to the transformation in eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) with @xmath172 .",
    "we find that each of the two pairs of two - qubit copies at the output of the copier is described by the same density operator ^(out)_a_0b_1 = |0000| + |1111| + ( |0101|+|1010| ) + ( |0011|+|1100| ) .",
    "[ 23 ] here the fidelity of copying is input - state independent . moreover , the quality of the cloned register is higher than that in eq .",
    "( [ 21 ] ) . again , using the peres - horodecki theorem we find that the density operator in eq .",
    "( [ 23 ] ) is inseparable if -^2 + .",
    "[ 24 ] we conclude that quantum inseparability can be copied better ( i.e. for much larger range of the parameter @xmath142 ) by using a nonlocal copier than when two local copiers are used .",
    "we have presented the universal optimal quantum copying machine which optimally clones a single original qubit to @xmath0 qubits .",
    "we have found a simple quantum network which realizes this quantum copier .",
    "in addition we have presented a universal cloner for quantum registers .",
    "we have numerically tested the optimality of this cloner , but the rigorous proof has still be presented .",
    "quantum copiers can be effectively utilized in various processes designed for manipulation with quantum information . in particular , quantum copiers can be used for an optimal eavesdropping @xcite ; they can be applied for realization of the optimal generalized ( povm ) measurements @xcite , or they can be utilized for storage and retrieval of information in quantum computers @xcite .    , _ nature _ * 299 * , 802 ( 1982 ) .",
