    "recently there is a growing interest in the low - temperature physics of disordered many - particle systems , such as electron dephasing due to interactions @xcite and the two - dimensional ( 2d ) metal - insulator transition @xcite .",
    "transport properties through quantum dots ( qds ) have also been recently investigated and shown to exhibit interesting behavior in the presence of both interactions and disorder @xcite .",
    "an analytical treatment of these problems is unfortunately difficult , since both the disorder and the interactions can not be considered as a small perturbation .",
    "exact numerical methods for these problems are restricted to small systems , since the size of the many - particle hilbert space grows exponentially with the system size .    during recent years",
    ", several methods were used to decrease the hilbert space to a size which is computationally feasible .",
    "one way is to define an iterative order in which the system is treated , and use a smart truncation method between the iterations to reduce the space size .",
    "this is the idea behind the ensemble of renormalization group methods , such as the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) @xcite and the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite .",
    "a different approach uses a predefined constraint in order to truncate .",
    "thus , the entire system may be treated at once , yet not all the system states are taken into account . therefore , the matrix size one needs to diagonalize is smaller than the entire hilbert space dimension , and hopefully small enough to be exactly solved .",
    "for example , one can approximate the ground state ( gs ) energy of a system by considering only part of the single - level eigenstates .",
    "a sorted list of the eigenstates can be obtained by performing a self - consistent hartree - fock ( hf ) calculation , after which the eigenvectors with the highest eigenvalues are neglected @xcite .",
    "such states should , intuitively , have the smallest contribution to the many - particle gs energy .",
    "another suggestion is based on the localization of the fock space . since the interaction term is a two - body operator , only many - body states which differ by at most two electron - hole pairs are coupled by the hamiltonian .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the average contribution of a state containing @xmath0 electron - hole pairs to the exact gs is proportional to @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the fock space localization length .",
    "considering also the number of states in the @xmath0-th electron - hole generation , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the number of electrons and @xmath5 is the number of single - particle states , one finds @xcite that the weight of generations falls off exponentially as long as @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "thus one can consider in the approximated hamiltonian only states with a small number of particle - hole ( ph ) pairs .    in the following we denote these global truncation methods as energy - truncation ( et ) and generation - truncation ( gt ) .",
    "for a full discussion of both see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , one can not simply implement these global truncation methods for larger systems . as the size of the system increases , the number of energy states or ph generations , for a given cutoff , increases , and thus the matrix size increases exponentially ,",
    "and it soon becomes too large to be solved exactly .",
    "therefore , an alternative method is needed , which can give an accurate approximation to the gs energy , yet can be extended to larger systems . in the following",
    "we show that a generation - based ph - dmrg method is suitable for that task .",
    "we model the qd as a 2d disordered lattice occupied by @xmath4 spinless electrons . hopping between nearest neighbors ( nns ) , and",
    "either nn or coulomb interactions are considered .",
    "therefore , the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is one of the terms @xmath10 here , @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote creation and annihilation operators of an electron in lattice site @xmath13 , @xmath14 represents nns , @xmath15 is the on - site energy of site @xmath13 , chosen randomly from a uniform distribution @xmath16 $ ] , and @xmath17 is the hopping matrix element between nns which is conventionally taken as the energy unit . in the interaction terms , @xmath18 is the nn interaction strength , @xmath19 is the coulomb interaction in a distance of one lattice unit , and @xmath20 is the distance between sites @xmath13 and @xmath21 , measured in lattice units .",
    "the gs energy of the system is calculated using the ph - dmrg method @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of the specific implementation can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the general idea of the method is to divide the hf single - particle energy levels to those above ( particle - states ) and below ( hole - states ) @xmath22 , and then treat these states iteratively . starting from the vacuum state , in which all levels below @xmath22 are filled , and",
    "all the others are empty , in each iteration one particle - state and one hole - state are added , starting from @xmath22 and proceeding in both directions .",
    "the superblock is composed of the states already added , by maintaining the number of particles constant .",
    "the superblock diagonalization is followed by a truncation of the hilbert space of both the particle block and the hole block , using their corresponding density matrices .",
    "the iteration ends , and a new couple of states can be added again .",
    "the process stops after all of the states were added .",
    "the accuracy of the ph - dmrg method depends mostly on the number of states , @xmath23 , that are kept between successive iterations .",
    "in other words , in each iteration , @xmath23 eigenvectors of the density matrix are taken , while all the others are neglected . except the accuracy ,",
    "@xmath23 influences dramatically the computational resources required during the process .    in order to compare the ph - dmrg method to other approximations",
    "we define the error rate , or the discrepancy , as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is an exact quantity and @xmath26 is an approximation for @xmath25 . by calculating @xmath27 , averaging over different realizations of the disorder ,",
    "one thus has a good estimate about the accuracy of the approximation method .",
    "in order to examine the accuracy of the ph - dmrg method we investigate the case of a @xmath28 lattice with a disorder strength @xmath29 , with the same disorder ensemble used in ref .  @xcite . in this section",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case of nn interactions , with strength @xmath30 , and use @xmath31 .",
    "typical results , for a specific realization , are shown in fig .",
    "[ phfig_1](a ) ( circles ) , as a function of @xmath23 , the number of block states kept . the results are compared to the hf results , to the results of the et method , in which the lowest @xmath32 hf states were used , and to those of the gt method , in which up to @xmath33 ph generations were kept .",
    "the exact results are also drawn .",
    "as @xmath23 increases , the ph - dmrg approximation improves .",
    "averaging over realizations ( fig .",
    "[ phfig_1](b ) ( circles ) ) shows that the average accuracy of the ph - dmrg calculation improves very slowly by increasing @xmath23 .",

    "( b ) the discrepancy @xmath36 averaged over an ensemble of @xmath37 realizations . ]",
    "the comparison between the ph - dmrg results and those of the gt method raise the following question : can one improve the ph - dmrg process without increasing @xmath23 ? in the following",
    "we present such an improvement , motivated by an analysis of the ph - dmrg truncation method .",
    "in essence , the main difference between the dmrg and nrg methods , is the truncation algorithm . in the nrg method ,",
    "the truncation of states is based on their energies , while in the dmrg it is based on the density - matrix eigenvalues .",
    "the density - matrix eigenvectors with the highest eigenvalues are considered as the most important , and the rest of the states are neglected .    nevertheless , this difference is not the main reason for the dmrg success .",
    "this success originates from the fact that while the nrg truncation method is based only on the sites which were already iteratively added , the dmrg algorithm is influenced by additional sites included in the superblock .",
    "the superblock is composed of a `` system '' coupled to an `` environment '' , which represents all the sites which were not yet included in the iteration process , and thus the truncation is based on extrapolation , which leads to better results .",
    "on the other hand , the superblock in the ph - dmrg does not consider any `` future '' states .",
    "the ph - dmrg process couples only the current particle - states and hole - states , but other states are not part of the superblock .",
    "therefore , the truncation does not take them into account , and this limits its success .    in order to improve the truncation decision we suggest to improve the ph - dmrg method by taking into account the number of ph generations as an extra condition taken during the truncation step .",
    "as we have discussed above , the idea of the fock space localization indicates that the weight of successive ph generations decreases exponentially .",
    "therefore , one expects that among states belonging to a given iteration , those with a smaller number of ph generations are more important .    in order to incorporate this criterion into the density - matrix truncation process",
    ", we retain all states which contain less than @xmath0 ph generations in the first round .",
    "if there are too many such states , we use the density - matrix eigenvalues , and take the states with the highest eigenvalues .",
    "after this first round , if there is still a room for more states , we retain also states with @xmath38 , according to their density - matrix eigenvalues , until the maximal number of states @xmath23 is reached .    for the @xmath28 system with @xmath39 electrons , we ve executed the suggested truncation method for @xmath40 , and for each realization picked the lowest energy .",
    "it turns out , however , that in @xmath41 percents of the samples the @xmath42 case is the most accurate , so that using a constant @xmath42 would lead to similar results .",
    "these results are also shown in fig .",
    "[ phfig_1 ] ( crosses ) .",
    "as can be clearly seen , the results obtained by the improved method , termed generation - based ph - dmrg ( gph - dmrg ) , are better by almost @xmath43 percents than the regular ph - dmrg results , and are comparable to the results of the gt method of ref .  @xcite .",
    "the results of the previous section were obtained for short - range interactions . in the framework of the real - space dmrg method",
    "there is a huge impact when the interaction range increases .",
    "the dmrg iterations add subsequent sites one after another , and if long - range interactions are considered , much more data should be stored from previous steps .",
    "practically , therefore , real - space dmrg applications traditionally consider only short - range interactions .    on the other hand ,",
    "the interactions range does not affect the gph - dmrg method almost at all .",
    "it does of course change the self consistent hf stage , however , the entire iterations process , which is the most taxing stage of the gph - dmrg algorithm , remains the same .",
    "thus , one may ask what effect does the interactions range have on the gph - dmrg accuracy .",
    "a related question is how the accuracy is changed when the interactions become stronger .    in fig .",
    "[ phfig_1c ] we present the discrepancy between the exact gs and the one obtained by the gph - dmrg for short - range ( upper panel ) and long - range ( lower panel ) interactions .",
    "both strong ( filled symbols ) and intermediate ( empty symbols ) interaction strengths are considered .",
    "since these results were obtained for lattices with @xmath44 electrons , i.e. , the number of hole - states is small , the accuracy of both the hf approximation and the gph - dmrg method is better than in the previous section .",
    "however , the results show that for both interaction types the gph - dmrg accuracy is reduced when the interaction strength is enhanced .",
    "a striking feature is the difference in the discrepancy between the short - range and the long - range interactions . for small values of @xmath23 , the improvement in accuracy of the long - range case",
    "is explained by the fact that the hf approximation is better .",
    "nevertheless , the improvement of the long - range results by the gph - dmrg method is fascinating ( @xmath45 for @xmath46 is reduced by two orders of magnitude ) , and the averaged discrepancy ( for @xmath46 with @xmath47 states ) is @xmath48 , more than an order of magnitude better than the accuracy in the short - range case .",
    "as a useful application of the gph - dmrg we calculate the addition spectrum of a qd , and compare the discrepancy to that of the hf approximation .",
    "the addition spectrum can be defined by @xmath49 therefore , for a calculation of @xmath50 one needs the gs energies of @xmath33 successive electron numbers for each realization , and we choose the ensemble of @xmath28 samples used in the previous sections , occupied by @xmath51 and @xmath44 electrons , with nn or coulomb interactions . in general , the results are better in the coulombic case , because of a higher accuracy for each energy calculation .    1truecm    in fig .",
    "[ phfig_2 ] the results for the averaged discrepancy of @xmath50 are presented .",
    "the hf approximation obtains , for coulomb interactions , @xmath52 percents .",
    "the gph - dmrg method , even with a very small number of states ( @xmath53 ) , exhibits an improvement of the error rate by more than an order of magnitude , to a level of @xmath54 percents .    however , in the nn case the results are quite poor . the starting point of the gph - dmrg algorithm , i.e. , the hf results , give an average error of almost @xmath55 percents .",
    "the gph - dmrg improves it by a factor of @xmath56 , to the order of @xmath57 percent , which is still a very high error rate .",
    "it is thus interesting to check whether the calculation of @xmath58 and @xmath59 are more accurate .",
    "these results are shown in fig .",
    "[ phfig_3 ] .",
    "0.7truecm    as can be seen , the results for @xmath58 are very accurate for both interaction types , even for very small @xmath23 .",
    "notice that the results continue to fluctuate around the exact result , since the approximation for @xmath50 is done using @xmath33 different gs approximations , which have different convergence rates .",
    "however , for @xmath53 , the error is less than @xmath60 percent in both cases .",
    "the results of @xmath61 , on the other hand , show slow convergence .",
    "the error rates obtained by the gph - dmrg ( using @xmath62 ) for the different cases are summarized in table  [ tbl : phdmrg_res_d2 ] .",
    "the ratio between the hf discrepancy and that of the gph - dmrg is shown in parentheses .",
    ".gph - dmrg error rates for @xmath50 calculation [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     0.3truecm    it is easy to see that for coulomb interactions the gph - dmrg improves all results related to the addition spectrum by an order of magnitude , and leads to error rates of less than @xmath63 percent for all cases .",
    "however , for the nn interactions , a small error rate and a significant improvement are seen only for @xmath58 , while modest factors are obtained for @xmath64 and @xmath61 , with error rates larger than @xmath57 percents .",
    "in the previous sections we have seen that with an improvement of the truncation algorithm , the gph - dmrg method can be used for an accurate approximation of the gs energy in disordered systems with interactions . in each of the cases we have checked , the gph - dmrg led to a significant improvement of the hf results . a comparison to the two methods of ref .",
    "@xcite shows that the gph - dmrg error rate is better than that of the et method , and is similar to that of the gt one .    nevertheless , for a full comparison one must also consider the feasibility of these methods when larger systems are treated .",
    "to understand the difference between the methods , we compare the matrix sizes for the case considered in section [ sec : ph_res ] .",
    "the et , based on @xmath32 energy levels , and the gt , with up to @xmath33 ph generations , require the diagonalization of matrices of sizes @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "the largest superblock hamiltonian in the gph - dmrg process , for @xmath67 , is of size @xmath68 .",
    "when a larger lattice is studied , and in order to get the same accuracy as for the small system , the et and gt methods must include more levels and generations . even was it sufficient to take the same number of levels and generations as in the small case , the size of matrices would have grown exponentially with the lattice size .",
    "therefore , these methods become infeasible even for modest lattice sizes . in the gph - dmrg method , on the other hand , the size of the matrix depends on the block size , and not on the system size .",
    "nevertheless , for larger systems , the number of single - particle states is larger , and the discrepancy of the gph - dmrg is expected to increase , unless @xmath23 is increased . therefore , the matrix size being diagonalized is expected to increase in the gph - dmrg method as well .",
    "the dependence of the largest matrix size needed to be diagonalized in the gph - dmrg process , @xmath69 , on @xmath23 , is shown in fig .  [ phfig_6 ] .",
    "although for large values of @xmath23 , a linear dependence was proposed @xcite , from our results a power law @xmath70 seems more appropriate . in any case",
    ", it is clear that the matrix size is less than quadratic in @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , since the largest matrix size used in our current gph - dmrg application is still much below the technology limit , its increase should not be impossible .",
    "it is thus clear that in principle the gph - dmrg is capable of treating larger systems .      as a final remark",
    "we note that the addition spectrum of disordered qds with interactions is a long - standing question in mesoscopic physics .",
    "specifically , the behavior of @xmath61 for strong interactions is not completely understood .",
    "a comprehensive study of this question was performed a few years ago using the self - consistent hf method @xcite .",
    "based on our results , it may thus be relevant to re - examine that question using the gph - dmrg method .",
