    "the reversed field pinch ( rfp ) configuration has been known for a long time as a possible candidate for the magnetic confinement of fusion plasmas @xcite . among toroidal configurations , it is the only one which could in principle achieve reactor - relevant conditions without the need of additional heating systems , thanks to its high level of ohmic power dissipation . nevertheless , up to recent years",
    "the rfp was regarded as having poor confinement properties , due to the simultaneous presence of several mhd tearing modes with m=1 poloidal periodicity @xcite .",
    "these modes are resonant at different radii within the plasma core , and their magnetic islands overlap , so that magnetic surfaces are destroyed and a high level of magnetic chaos ensues . as a consequence , plasmas with flat density and temperature profiles over the whole plasma core are produced in this condition , which is dubbed multiple helicity ( mh ) state .",
    "the presence of these modes is intrinsic to the configuration , since they are required to drive poloidal currents in the outer plasma region while the applied electric field is only toroidal ( dynamo effect ) @xcite . in the past ,",
    "chaos reduction was obtained transiently by inductive poloidal current drive @xcite , but a way of obtaining this effect in a stationary fashion is still lacking .",
    "this view of the rfp as a stochastic plasma with bad confinement properties is radically changing , thanks to the recent discovery of a new class of equilibria , which have been dubbed single helical axis ( shax ) states @xcite .",
    "shax states are the result of a natural tendency of rfp plasmas to move , as dissipation changes , towards a single helicity ( sh ) condition , that is a condition where only one of the core - resonant tearing modes provides the dynamo effect @xcite .",
    "this tendency , which has been predicted since several years by 3d mhd simulations @xcite , has been confirmed by experimental results in several rfp devices @xcite , where states in which the innermost resonant m=1 mode dominates over the others ( secondary modes ) have been observed .",
    "such conditions are generally called quasi single helicity ( qsh ) states , since they differ from the theoretical sh ones due to the fact that the secondary modes still have a non - negligible amplitude . in particular , in the rfx - mod device ( r = 2 m , a = 0.459 m ) it has been observed , when feedback control of the radial magnetic field at the edge is applied @xcite , that the duration and frequency of occurrence of qsh states increases with plasma current @xcite . the secondary mode amplitude , normalized to the total magnetic field",
    ", is also found to decrease with increasing plasma current , so that experimental qsh states are progressively approaching the ideal sh condition @xcite .",
    "plasma current increase is strongly correlated to an increase of electron temperature @xcite .    in the qsh",
    "states the dominant mode amplitude is found to increase with plasma current , inducing a bifurcation to a new topological structure of the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "this happens because , beyond a threshold in the dominant mode amplitude , the x - point of the magnetic island separatrix collapses on the main magnetic axis , and the two disappear , leaving the original island o - point as the only magnetic axis .",
    "thus , a helical plasma column is obtained in the axisymmetric device .",
    "these shax states , which represent a special flavour of the more general qsh condition , are more resilient to magnetic chaos , due to the disappearance of the separatrix @xcite .",
    "they constitute a new paradigm for high performance rfp plasmas , which could lead to a re - evaluation of the potential of this configuration for fusion reactor development .    in this paper",
    "we propose a method to determine the flux surface shape of rfp discharges in a shax state , which involves only the solution of ordinary differential equations .",
    "the method , which has been implemented in a code named sheq ( single helicity equilibrium ) starts from the symplectic representation of the magnetic field @xcite , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a generic system of curvilinear coordinates used to describe the toroidal system .",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 represent the toroidal flux through a constant @xmath4 surface and the poloidal flux outside a constant @xmath5 surface , respectively , both divided by @xmath6 .",
    "the existence of magnetic flux surfaces is assured if a function @xmath7 such that @xmath8 exists .",
    "flux surfaces are then described by the equation @xmath9 ( or @xmath10 for any @xmath11 function of @xmath12 only ) .",
    "the magnetic axis is defined by @xmath13 . in the case of an axisymmetric plasma with circular cross - section",
    "the function @xmath12 can be taken to coincide with the radius @xmath14 of the magnetic flux surfaces , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 may be interpreted as the usual toroidal and poloidal flux , respectively . in the case of a general magnetic field , @xmath17 and @xmath18 in ( 1 )",
    "are not constant over flux surfaces , flux surface existence being not guaranteed in the general 3d case . in other terms , we can say that adding a generic perturbation field to the axisymmetric one , the circular flux surfaces are destroyed , and it is not clear a priori if some other flux surfaces exist , and which can be the function @xmath12 that labels them .",
    "if one assumes a helical symmetry of the perturbation , so that @xmath5 and @xmath4 depend only on @xmath14 and on @xmath19 , the symmetry ensures flux surface existence , and it is straightforward to show that the helical flux @xmath20 is a flux function , that is @xmath21 .",
    "thus , the knowledge of @xmath22 enables to display the shape of the magnetic surfaces .",
    "this is the basic hypothesis adopted to treat shax states .",
    "the method that we propose for computing the helical flux in shax states is based on the approach described in ref .",
    "@xcite for calculating the tearing mode eigenfunctions in a force - free rfp plasma in toroidal geometry .",
    "the shax states are therefore considered as composed of a dominant , saturated tearing mode superposed on an axisymmetric equilibrium .",
    "the tearing mode amplitude is assumed to be small with respect to the axisymmetric fields , so that a perturbative approach can be adopted .",

    "@xcite will be used .",
    "the most relevant results of ref .",
    "@xcite are reviewed in the two sections next , so as to give a self - consistent treatment of the equilibrium problem , the reader is referred to that paper for further details .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ zeroth ] the zeroth - order axisymmetric equilibrium calculation is introduced ; in section [ first ] the first order correction due to the dominant mode is computed ; in section [ helical ] the method used to compute the flux surfaces is described and validated by studying the mapping of electron temperature , density soft x - ray emission measurements on them ; in section [ averaging ] a method for computing flux surface averages is described , and an example application to power balance computation in a shax condition is given ; section [ ohmic ] is devoted to a discussion of the constraint given by the flux surface averaged ohm s law parallel component .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusions ] conclusions are drawn .",
    "let us consider a zeroth - order axisymmetric toroidal plasma with circular cross - section , formed in a vacuum chamber with major radius @xmath23 and minor radius @xmath24 .",
    "the flux surfaces are non - concentric circles , each having radius @xmath14 , being horizontally shifted by a quantity @xmath25 .",
    "the shift of the outermost flux surface is imposed as boundary condition ( in the experiments this is obtained from external magnetic measurements ) . a point lying on one of these flux surfaces is identified by the radius @xmath14 of the surface , by the poloidal angle @xmath26 measured with respect to the inboard mid plane , and by the toroidal angle @xmath27 .",
    "these coordinates , which we call geometric coordinates , @xmath28 , are related to the standard cylindrical system @xmath29 used to describe toroidal fusion devices by @xmath30 where @xmath23 is the torus major radius .",
    "the @xmath31 coordinate system is curvilinear and non - orthogonal , in order to properly take into account the toroidal geometry .",
    "a complete knowledge of the metric tensor is essential ( see appendix a for a brief reminder on curvilinear coordinates ) .",
    "the metric tensor and the jacobian of the geometric coordinates are given in appendix b.    the contravariant representation of the zeroth - order magnetic field associated with the geometric coordinate system is @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are , respectively , the toroidal and poloidal flux divided by @xmath35 .",
    "the equilibrium is fully defined once @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath25 and @xmath38 are known .",
    "following the standard procedure for introducing flux coordinates @xcite , one can define a new poloidal angle as @xmath39 with @xmath40 . here and in the following a prime designates derivative with respect to @xmath14 of quantities which are functions of @xmath14 only . in the @xmath41 system , which we call flux coordinates , the magnetic field lines are straight and the magnetic field",

    "ampre s law allows to deduce the current density contravariant components @xmath48 . from the force balance condition and",
    "@xmath49 one gets @xmath50 . using this information , and performing an expansion in the small aspect ratio parameter @xmath51 ,",
    "it is possible to compute the quantity relating @xmath26 and @xmath52 as @xmath53 where @xmath54 the inverse of transformation ( [ vartheta ] ) is then easily derived as @xmath55 using equation ( [ lambda ] ) the relation between cylindrical @xmath56 and flux coordinates @xmath57 can also be found : @xmath58 @xmath59 so @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the flux coordinate jacobian for a large aspect ratio torus is , as stated in appendix b , @xmath62 with @xmath63 it is possible to show that , for a force - free equilibrium , in flux coordinates the current density is proportional to the magnetic field through a coefficient which is a function of @xmath14 only , that is @xmath64    it is convenient to define , for a generic field @xmath65 , its hatted version as @xmath66 , which hides the jacobian contribution .",
    "the zeroth - order hatted magnetic field and current density components , function of @xmath14 only , are then : @xmath67    given the @xmath68 profile , which is an input to the algorithm , the zeroth - order force balance yields the following equations : @xmath69 = -\\sigma(r)\\hat{b}_0^\\vartheta \\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left[\\frac{g_{\\vartheta\\vartheta}^w}{\\sqrt{g_w}}\\hat{b}_0^\\vartheta\\right ] - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\vartheta}\\left(\\frac{g_{r\\vartheta}^w}{\\sqrt{g_w}}\\right)\\hat{b}_0^\\vartheta = \\sigma(r)\\hat{b}_0^\\phi.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the second equation contains metric coefficients which are function of @xmath14 and @xmath52 . by using the expansion in harmonics described in appendix b , it can be split into two equations , one for @xmath70 and one for @xmath71 .",
    "furthermore , because of the nonlinearity given by the fact that the metric coefficients depend on @xmath71 , it is convenient to introduce a perturbative expansion : @xmath72 the resulting equations for the lowest order contribution are @xmath73 which can be solved for @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the solution starts from the magnetic axis , where regularity imposes @xmath76 and @xmath77 , and proceeds to the edge .",
    "the solutions are then rescaled so as to match a boundary condition , for example the edge poloidal field .",
    "these solutions are then be plugged into the equation for the shift @xmath78 which is solved using the boundary conditions @xmath79 and an assigned value for @xmath80 , @xmath81 being the radius at which the magnetic measurements yielding the condition are located .    having determined the shift @xmath25 , the next order correction to the fields can be computed by @xmath82 = -\\sigma(r)\\hat{b}^\\vartheta_2 \\\\ \\fl\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(\\frac{r}{r_0}\\hat{b}^\\vartheta_2\\right ) +   \\frac{d}{dr}\\left[\\frac{r}{r_0}\\left(\\frac{r^2}{2r_0 ^ 2}+\\frac{\\delta'^2}{2}+\\frac{r}{2r_0}\\delta ' -\\frac{\\delta}{r_0}\\right)\\hat{b}_1^\\vartheta\\right ] = \\sigma(r)\\hat{b}^\\phi_2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] again , these equations are solved starting from the axis , where regularity requires @xmath83 and @xmath84r$ ] , @xmath85 being the shift of the magnetic axis . in practice this correction turns out to be very small .",
    "it is worth noting that this method of computing the zeroth - order axisymmetric equilibrium , if compared to the standard grad - shafranov equation , has the advantage of requiring simply the solution of five ordinary differential equations .",
    "this is obtained at the price of being restricted to deal with circular flux surfaces , which is however reasonable for present day rfp devices .",

    "furthermore , if the mode has a resonant surface inside the plasma , a discontinuity in the eigenfunction derivative should be allowed .",
    "the magnitude of this discontinuity is obtained by imposing a further boundary condition , that is the amplitude of the toroidal magnetic field component at the same surface where the radial one is determined ( that is the surface where the sensors are located ) .",

    "the parallel component of ohm s law gives , in stationary conditions , @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the electrostatic potential and @xmath164 is the toroidal loop voltage .",
    "multiplying by the jacobian of the coordinate system in use , and integrating over the two angular variables , the term involving the electrostatic potential cancels , and one finds @xmath165 this relationship defines the ohmic constraint that any stationary equilibrium should satisfy .",
    "the two sides of the ohmic constraint are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig_ohmic ] for a typical 1.5 ma shax state . as for the power balance described in the preceding section",
    ", a flat @xmath166 profile has been assumed .",
    "a remarkable discrepancy can be seen , with the first term being larger than the second one in the inner portion of the plasma , and smaller in the outer one .",
    "such discrepancy could be partially resolved assuming a profile of effective charge with a peak in the center of the plasma , instead of the flat profile which has been assumed here . even though a screening of impurity influx has been observed in laser blow - off experiments @xcite , a trapping in the central part of the plasma of impurities existing prior to the shax state onset",
    "might occur .",
    "even if this is the case , the @xmath167 model assumed for the zeroth - order parallel current density appears anyway to be not appropriate , since in the outer part of the plasma the profile of @xmath168 changes sign , whereas the other one does not .",
    "this requires either to assume a profile of @xmath169 changing sign in this region , or a residual dynamo contribution of the secondary modes .",

    "in this paper we have described a perturbative method for the computation of helical equilibria for the shax states of rfp plasmas in force - free approximation . by using the limitation of assuming a zeroth - order axisymmetric equilibrium with circular flux surfaces , it has been possible to reduce its calculation , and the subsequent calculation of the dominant mode eigenfunction , to the solution of ordinary differential equations . the helical flux given by the superposition of the zeroth - order equilibrium and of the eigenfunction",
    "has been demonstrated to be a good flux function , by comparison with spatially resolved measurements of different plasma quantities .",
    "both the force free approximation and the perturbative approach do not appear to give errors which go beyond the statistical uncertainty of the measurements used for the validation , at least for the conditions which have been explored up to now in the rfx - mod device ( plasma currents up to 1.8 ma ) .",
    "in particular , being the @xmath129 value of these plasmas of a few percent , the approximation of neglecting the pressure gradient term in the equilibrium equation appears to be valid , despite the presence of a region of strong gradient .",
    "large increases in performance are allowed before this approximation breaks down .    as already discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the possibility of mapping the kinetic measurements on the helical flux surfaces resulting from the equilibrium reconstruction constitutes a proof of the existence of at least some reminiscence of such surfaces in the plasma . while there are no proofs",
    "that actual kam surfaces are formed , it has been shown that cantori , that is broken kam surfaces , are sufficient for supporting temperature gradients @xcite .",
    "these ordered structures have been named `` ghost surfaces '' @xcite .",
    "the possibility that such ghost surfaces appear in the otherwise chaotic rfx plasma when the shax state is attained is the most likely explanation for the experimental observations .",
    "the availability of an equilibrium reconstruction for the high performance shax states , as given by the sheq code which implements the method that we have described , opens the path for several lines of research . among the work in progress",
    "are the use of the astra code @xcite for performing transport calculations taking into account the helical geometry and the evaluation of crucial quantities such as the safety factor profile .",
