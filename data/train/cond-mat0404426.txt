    "among the several interesting potential applications of nanostructures and nanodevices is their role as small - size test ground for the analysis of the influence of many - body interactions in the physics of strongly correlated electronic systems .",
    "these correlation effects are believed to be of crucial important in many bulk materials , such as high - temperature superconductors and manganites , but there is no universal agreement on what formalism is the most appropriate for their study .",
    "verifying the accuracy of simple model hamiltonians in nanoscale systems can provide an important test of the overall validity of the theoretical formalism .",
    "moreover , several compounds are believed to spontaneously form a complex pattern of nanoislands @xcite and , as a consequence , accurate studies of a small number of atoms can produce interesting information even for bulk materials .",
    "in addition , new and novel effects can and do emerge from the quantum behavior of electrons in small environments , which are not obviously present in bulk systems . if quantum dots are considered as parts of electronic circuits , it is important to understand the new properties that may arise due to the discrete nature of the quantized states , the influence of interactions and spin , and the coherence of the wave functions in small systems that requires a fully quantum description of the problem",
    ". it is only recently that this complicated physics is starting to be unveiled and novel effects have already been found .",
    "a typical case is provided by the kondo effect@xcite , which in the bulk produces an increase in the resistance of a sample below the kondo temperature @xmath1 . on the contrary , in mesoscopic systems such as quantum dots",
    ", the same effect actually leads to a @xmath2 in the resistance since the kondo resonance provides a new channel for transport @xcite .",
    "the analysis of dots is not a mere academic problem .",
    "for example , transport properties at low temperatures across quantums dots ( qds ) have received considerable attention in the last few years mainly due the possibility to use these structures in quantum computing and spintronics .",
    "more specifically , two coupled quantum dots ( 2qd ) have been proposed to represent tunable qubit circuits @xcite , where the spin interaction between the electrons in the dots defines the two states of the qubit .",
    "for all these reasons , the study of interacting electrons in nanosystems and its associated quantum transport are very important for progress in condensed matter physics in general .",
    "in several previous studies it has been usually @xmath3 that , e.g. , the 2qd have only one localized spin per dot , since only one level is assumed active in each dot . for the success of these proposals ,",
    "it is important to understand the role played by other levels in the qds  i.e. considering @xmath4 dots  providing part of the motivation for the work presented here .",
    "in addition , to properly perform these subtle studies it is crucial to carry out the calculations using @xmath5 techniques that do not assume properties of familiar states that arise from previous experience with bulk materials .",
    "concepts such as fermi liquids are and must be challenged in this context , since there is no reason to expect that nanoscopic entities will admit a similar description .",
    "ideally , the calculations should make the less possible number of assumptions , and in this framework it is important to develop and use suitable @xmath6 techniques to handle these complicated fully - quantum problems accurately . for this reason ,",
    "the calculations discussed below were carried out with a powerful numerical method that has been recently developed .",
    "other interesting investigations in this context have proposed the use of quantum dots as @xmath7 in the aharanov - bohm ( ab ) geometry with external magnetic fields applied @xcite . in general , previous efforts have considered a magnetic flux enclosed in two possibles paths for the electrons . in these studies ,",
    "the tunneling matrix - elements are defined with an explicit phase factor that represents the magnetic flux .",
    "these investigations have shown that narrow @xmath8 in the conductance could appear as a consequence of phase interference in the ab circuit , for electrons moving through different pathways .",
    "other investigations have also found conductance cancellations for the case of two quantum dots , individually connected to leads and among themselves @xcite . this effect is present even using one - body interactions in the formalism , and it is caused by interference effects between two different paths in the geometry of the problem .",
    "one additional important motivation for the analysis discussed in the present paper is to find alternative sources of interference among wave functions that can also lead to dips in conductance , _ in the absence of external fields and also in the absence of obviously distinct paths_. effects of this variety were recently addressed in multilevel dots by kim and hershfield @xcite , where the consequences of having tunneling matrix elements with different signs in a multilevel qd and in an ab circuit were discussed .",
    "these authors showed that the matrix - element signs are important to determine the global phase of the electrons when they cross the qd .",
    "also , arrays of odd - number interacting single - level quantum dots have interesting zeros in the conductance as the gate voltage varies @xcite .    in the investigations presented here",
    ", we consider a system composed of one or more quantum dots ",
    "each with two active levels and including the hubbard many - body interactions  coupled to ideal single - channel leads . in gate - voltage regimes",
    "where there is only one electron in the qd , the usual kondo physics @xcite can be found in the low temperature regime .",
    "the coupling between the spin in the qd and the spins in the leads creates a resonance at the fermi level that contributes to the transport .",
    "when a second electron enters in the qd a more interesting physics is observed since now the total spin of the system ( singlet or triplet ) plays an important role @xcite .",
    "one of the main results of our investigations is that the two levels of the dots studied here can act as different channels that individually contribute to the overall conductance with their own phase .",
    "this phase plays a role similar to that of a magnetic field in the ab interferometer , and it can induce constructive or destructive interferences .",
    "below , it is explicitly shown that a phase diference of @xmath9 can exist between the two channels , even if there is no explicit difference between their hopping amplitudes and coulombic interactions .",
    "only a tiny difference in the energies of the two levels is needed for the effect to develop , as well as a nonzero hubbard coupling which is required to produce the kondo physics .",
    "it should be remarked that this phase difference is different from the phase messured in some qd experiments @xcite since it is @xmath10 to the qd .",
    "a magnetic field is not necessary to observe this interference .",
    "others recent investigations have also focussed on systems that present interference processes even without magnetic fields or explicitly different paths .",
    "for instance , hofstetter and schoeller analyzed lateral quantum dots near the _ singlet - triplet _ degeneracy point that occurs from the competition of the hund rule s coupling , that favors the triplet , and the nonzero energy difference between levels , that favors a singlet state @xcite . a dip in the conductance",
    "was observed in this region .",
    "the study discussed in the present paper includes this singlet - triplet transition regime as a special case , but mainly focusses on a different variety of interference effects which are present even for a very small energy difference between the levels in the quantum dots .",
    "our main picture is based on the notion that charge transport can occur with different phases when electrons cross different levels of a quantum dot , rather than a singlet - triplet competition .",
    "alternatively , our results can also be visualized as interference between two kondo states : one with @xmath11 and the other with @xmath12 .",

    "[ sec : othercases ] , and the conclusions are provided in sec .  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "other effects analyzed in the paper include the possibility of observing _ localized states _ near the dots .",
    "one such localized state in the qd can cross the fermi level of the system without contributing to the conductance , but affecting the transport of other levels through the coulomb interaction .",
    "this is shown to lead to discontinuities  as opposed to cancellations  in the conductance vs. gate voltage , a concept that was not discussed before in the literature to our knowledge .",
    "the main system that will be analyzed in this paper , and especially in this section , consists of one quantum dot with several interacting levels , connected to ideal leads .",

    "these states are not of direct relevance for the transport of charge , but when the gate voltage moves them below the fermi level of the leads they simply increase the charge of the quantum dot , which indirectly affects transport through the coulombic interaction . note that , for @xmath19=@xmath47 , the phase difference between levels @xmath13 and @xmath14 is zero , since the green functions @xmath81 and @xmath82 are equal .",

    "similar results but for the case of @xmath19=@xmath21 are shown in fig .",

    "we can observe that the partial conductances @xmath42 and @xmath43 are individually small ( @xmath87 ) but as the phase between the two channels is 0 they contribute in a constructive way , inducing a peak in the total conductance .",

    "the fast convergence is a consequence of the local characteristics of the dot , namely all the important physics effects are contained in the small cluster solved exactly .",
    "the fast size convergence shows that even using the smallest cluster , the results are already qualitative correct .",

    "an important aspect of these results is that the conductance cancellations can occur in the absence of external magnetic fields  usually used in ab experiments  and also without introducing at the hamiltonian level any relative phase for the hopping amplitudes of the states involved .",
    "the coulombic interaction is the main responsible for the effect , which can also be visualized as an interference between @xmath77=1 and 1/2 kondo states .",

    "the results presented in this paper will hopefully provide motivation to experimentalists to refine their measurements to search for conductance cancellations .",
    "while our conductance vs. gate voltage curves should be cautiously used to compare against experiments  since the details of the results vary as a function of parameters , and in addition most results were obtained using only two active levels  the ideas introduced here are expected to be robust . when multilevel quantum dots with interacting electrons are considered , cancellations are the rule more than the exception",
    ".    experimental realizations of quantum dots with many active levels are possible .",

    "this is also important if transport properties through atoms are studied .",
    "this is more challenging experimentally than the study of relatively larger size quantum dots , but possible . in the case of atoms ,",
