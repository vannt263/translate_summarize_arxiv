    "electron in graphene , a monolayer of graphite with honeycomb lattice structure , exhibits relativistic nature as evident from the observed linear dispersion of energy and the zero energy state causing anomalous quantum hall effect @xcite . while in the reciprocal lattice space there are two valleys of opposite momentum , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the space of honeycomb lattice consists of two inequivalent sublattices , @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in the low energy limit",
    ", the electron in graphene is described by the dirac equation : the two valleys are analogue of energy or momentum and the sublattices that of spin . because of the relativistic - like character of electron in graphene , the phenomenon of zitterbewegung of electron@xcite has been shown renewed interest to unravel its the presence@xcite .",
    "schrodinger predicted the zitterbwegung of electron in the dirac descrption by following the equation of motion for the position operator , @xmath5 : = c * * [ comm1 ] since @xmath6 = -i\\hbar c { \\bf \\alpha}$ ] where @xmath7 is free particle dirac hamiltonian , @xmath8 and @xmath9 the dirac matrices , @xmath10 the momentum , @xmath11 the electron mass and , @xmath12 the velocity of light .",
    "the relation in eq .",
    "( [ comm1 ] ) is independent of the electron mass .",
    "this is in contrast with the corresponding non - relativistic case = p m [ nrcomm ] with the hamiltonian @xmath13 .",
    "( [ comm1 ] ) is the well - known statement that in special relativity the velocity and momentum are fundamentally different . from the eq .",
    "( [ comm1 ] ) , the position at time @xmath14 is @xcite r = r(0 ) + c^2 h^-1 p t + 1 2 i c _ 0 h^-1 e^-2iht / [ position ] where @xmath15 which is obtained using the equation of motion for @xmath16 in the heisenberg picture and @xmath17 the position at @xmath18 . in eq .",
    "( [ position ] ) , the second term is the average value while the third is instantaneous which is oscillating rapidly between the positive and negative energies .",
    "this oscillation is known as the zitterbewegung of electron @xcite .",
    "the oscillatory behaviour is interpreted to be arising due to interference of positive and negative energy states @xcite .",
    "let us note that in dirac theory , an initial state of mean momentum and spin @xmath19 given by a gaussian wavepacket will get evolved in time @xmath14 into a state that contains an admixture of @xmath20 and @xmath19 if the wavepacket width is smaller than or equal to the compton wavelength of the electron .",
    "even if the required confinement is achieved , the oscillatory components is too small to be predictable .",
    "therefore , one looks for a process being an embodiment of the zitterbewegung .",
    "this article attempts to depict the zitterbewegung phenomenon as the motion of the electron involving transition between the positive and negative energy states near the dirac point ( zero energy level ) in energy - momentum space and draw a similarity to the chiral or adler - bell - jackiw ( abj ) anomaly @xcite in ( 1 + 1 ) diemensional qed . since the transition involves crossing the dirac point , the same may be a possible realisation and measure of zitterbewegung .",
    "we formulate such embodiment of zitterbewegung in a time dependent perturbation theory .",
    "the formulation is extended to graphene .",
    "the claim of similarity is limited to an anomaly - like realisation of the zitterbewegung .",
    "it does not imply one can be given in terms of the other .",
    "let us consider the motion of the electron in the neighbourhood of the dirac point .",
    "an electron state initially of momentum and spin being @xmath21 crosses the dirac point ( the zero energy level ) from its positive neighbourhood into its negative neighbourhood where it acquires new momentum and spin @xmath22 .",
    "continuous occurence of such transition of one state of @xmath23 to another of @xmath24 and vice versa in course of time results in the oscillation .",
    "each transition involves crossing of the dirac point .",
    "this happens at a finite interval of time .",
    "this oscillation is the zitterbewegung of electron .",
    "the periodicity of the oscillation gives the number of the dirac point crossing .",
    "that is the measure of zitterbewegung .",
    "the transition does not necessarily change the spin but the momentum .    the zitterbewegung part of the dirac current as given in eq .",
    "( [ current ] ) ( the notation follows the appendix . ) : _ z ( 2 t + ) [ zbw0 ] where the subscript @xmath25 means the zitterbewegung .",
    "the rhs in the equation above is the only time dependent part of the current .",
    "the period of oscillation depends on the range of values which @xmath26 and @xmath14 take .",
    "this means the there is a restructuring of @xmath27 .",
    "this is the feature of zitterbewegung , despite the fact that it is kinematic effect .",
    "it is almost impossible for the restructuring to happen of qed vacuum without any perturbation . for",
    ", a perturbative analysis is proposed in section [ smat ] .",
    "this picture of zitterbewegung naively appears similar to the chiral anomaly in ( 1 + 1 ) qed which is a quantum effect though .",
    "let us recall the idea of the abj anomaly in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional qed @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of the abj anomaly relates to the production of weyl fermions in the presence of an external field , @xmath28 .",
    "the so - called weyl fermions are massless spin @xmath29 particles described by a parity non - invariant hamiltonian .",
    "they are of two components , left - handed ( rh ) and right - handed ( rh ) . in the absence of @xmath28 ,",
    "both the lh and rh fermions meet at the point of degeneracy . on slowly applying the external field , @xmath28 ,",
    "the degeneracy is lifted and the lh fermion moves down below the degenerate level while the rh fermion moves up in the energy - momentum space . for a particular value of @xmath28",
    "both lh and rh fermions meet again at the point of degeneracy . on further application of @xmath28 ,",
    "the degeneracy is lifted again and the lh fermion moves up while the rh fermion moves down .",
    "it should be understood as restructuring of energy levels or change of lh fermion into rh and vice versa while crossing the point of degeneracy as shown in figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "the result is the nonconservation of axial charges .",
    "that is the abj anomaly .",
    "the nonconservation of axial charge is seen as the movement electrons from the neighbourhood of lh degeneracy point to that of rh in energy - momentum space , without net production of electrons , in the presence of external field @xcite .    .",
    "spatial length is set to be unity . ]",
    "although the two phenomena are different , the naive similarity arises at the level of restructuring of the energy levels which corresponds to the transition of a state from the positive energy to the negative .",
    "it is interesting to note the following : the chiral anomaly ( a ) occurs due to mass term in the absence of external field ( fujukawa dervation @xcite ) , ( b ) chiral current is not conserved and ( c ) is sensitive to dimensionality , whereas the zitterbewegung ( d ) involves ( although implicitly ) spin - orbit interaction , ( e ) implies non - conservation of spin current and ( f ) is independent of dimensionality .",
    "however , effective dimensional reduction occurs when the system is under external magnetic field .",
    "while zitterbewegung is a kinematic effect as a consequence of incorporating special relativity in quantum mechanics , the chiral anomaly is a dynamical phenomenon as a consequence of second quantisation . from the point of their similarity",
    ", we may get an insight of zitterbewegung of electron .",

    "of the terms in the second line of eq .",
    "( [ bveq ] ) , the first term is the probability of the initial positive state remaining the same with @xmath39 while the second one is the probability of a positive energy state making transition into a negative energy state with momentum @xmath33 and spin @xmath34 in presence of external field . to make this statement hold , the @xmath40 integration in eq .",
