    "a traveling salesman wants to visit all vertices of a graph @xmath11 , starting from his home @xmath12 , and  since it is friday  ending his tour at his week - end residence , @xmath13 .",

    "is usually understood as the @xmath15 particular case of the defined problem , where in addition every vertex is visited exactly once .",
    "this `` minimum length hamiltonian circuit '' problem is one of the main exhibited problems of combinatorial optimization . besides being -hard even for very special graphs or lengths @xcite , even the best up to date methods of operations research , the most powerful computers programmed by the brightest hackers fail solving reasonable size problems exactly .    on the other hand ,",
    "some implementations provide solutions only a few percent away from the optimum on some large `` real - life '' instances . a condition on the length function that certainly helps both in theory and practice is the triangle inequality . a nonnegative function on the edges that satisfies this inequality",

    "metric _ function .",
    "the special case of the tsp where @xmath16 is a complete graph and @xmath17 is a metric is called the _",
    "metric tsp_. for a thoughtful and distracting account of the difficulties and successes of the tsp , see bill cook s book @xcite .",
    "if @xmath17 is not necessarily a metric function , the tsp is hopeless in general : it is not only -hard to solve but also to approximate , and even for quite particular lengths , since the hamiltonian cycle problem in @xmath18-regular graphs is -hard @xcite .",
    "the practical context makes it also natural to suppose that @xmath17 is a metric .",
    "a _ @xmath19-approximation algorithm _ for a minimization problem is a polynomial - time algorithm that computes a solution of value at most @xmath19 times the optimum , where @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",

    "the first trace of allowing @xmath22 and @xmath23 be different is hoogeveen s article @xcite , providing a christofides type @xmath6-approximation algorithm , again in the metric case .",
    "there had been no improvement until an , kleinberg and shmoys @xcite improved this ratio to @xmath24 with a simple algorithm , an ingenious new framework for the analysis , but a technically involved realization .",
    "the algorithm first determines an optimum @xmath4 of the fractional relaxation ; writing @xmath4 as a convex combination of spanning trees and applying christofides heuristic for each , it outputs the best of the arising tours . for the tsp problem",
    "@xmath9 dominates any possible parity correction , as wolsey @xcite observed , but this is not true if @xmath25 .",
    "however , @xcite manages to perturb @xmath9 , differently for each spanning tree of the constructed convex combination , with small average increase of the length .",
    "we adopt this algorithm and this global framework for the analysis , and develop new tools that essentially change its realization and shortcut the most involved parts .",

    "this version has many advantages : while the metric tsp is defined on the complete graph , the graphical problem can be sparse , since an edge which is not a shortest path between its endpoints can be deleted ; however , it is equivalent to the metric tsp ( see tours below ) ; the length function @xmath17 does not have to satisfy the triangle inequality ; this version has an unweighted special case , asking for the minimum size of a spanning eulerian subgraph .",
