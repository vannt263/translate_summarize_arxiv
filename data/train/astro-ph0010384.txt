    "recently , deep radio surveys ( @xmath3 mjy ) have shown that normalized radio counts show a flattening below a few mjy , ( see figure 1 for counts at 1.4 ghz ) .",
    "this change of slope is generally interpreted as being due to the presence of a new population of radio sources ( the so  called sub ",
    "mjy population ) which does not show up at higher flux densities ( see e.g. condon 1989 ) , where the counts are dominated by classical radio galaxies and quasars .",
    "the sub - mjy population is essentially composed by low luminosity agn and starburst galaxies , but their relative comtribution is still not firmely established .",
    "unfortunately , due to the long observing times required to reach faint fluxes , the existing samples in the sub ",
    "mjy region are generally small .    the identification work and the subsequent spectroscopy are very demanding in terms of telescope time .",
    "typically , no more than @xmath4 of the radio sources in sub ",
    "mjy samples have been identified on optical images , even though in the @xmath5jy survey in the hubble deep field and in ssa13 80@xmath1 of the 111 radio sources have been identified ( richards et al .",
    "1999 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the typical fraction of spectra available is only @xmath6 .",
    "the best studied sample is the marano field , where 50@xmath1 of the sources have spectra ( gruppioni et al .",
    "1999a ) , which permitted the determination of spectral type and redshift for 29 objects . to alleviate the identification work , regions with deep photometry already available ( possibly multicolor ) provide a significant advantage .",
    "the region we have selected fulfills these requirements at least partially .",
    "vettolani et al . ( 1997 ) made a deep redshift survey near the sgp by studying photometrically and spectroscopically nearly all galaxies down to @xmath7 19.4 .",
    "the survey , yielding 3342 redshifts ( vettolani et al .",
    "1998 ) , has a typical depth of @xmath8 with 10@xmath1 of the objects at @xmath9 and is @xmath10 complete .    in the same region",
    "a radio survey has been carried out with the atca ( australia telescope compact array ) at 1400 mhz ( prandoni et al .",
    "2000a , b ) .",
    "it consists of 16 radio mosaics with @xmath11 resolution and uniform sensitivity ( @xmath12 noise level @xmath079  @xmath5jy ) over the whole area of the esp redshift survey ( @xmath13 sq .",
    "degrees at @xmath14 ) .",
    "we detected @xmath15 distinct radio sources down to a flux density limit of @xmath16 mjy ( @xmath17 ) , 1403 being sub ",
    "mjy sources .",
    "we used the atesp catalogue to derive the differential atesp source counts down to 0.70 mjy ( prandoni et al .",
    "these counts are compared with the most updated previous determinations at 1.4 ghz ( see fig .  1 ) . also shown is the interpolation determined by windhorst et al .",
    "( 1990 ) from a collection of @xmath18 radio sources belonging to 24 different surveys at 1.4 ghz , representing the state of the art at that time ( solid line ) .",
    "there is consistency between the atesp counts and those obtained by other recent surveys , with the exception of the phoenix deep survey ( pdf and pdfs , hopkins et al .",
    "1998 ) , whose counts at @xmath19 mjy are systematically higher than the atesp counts ( and also higher than the counts derived from the other surveys presented in the figure ) .",
    "the atesp counts are in very good agreement with the first counts ( white et al .",
    "1997 ) , which are the most accurate available today over the flux range 230 mjy .",
    "the atesp survey , on the other hand , provides the best determination of the counts at fainter fluxes ( @xmath20 mjy ) , where the first becomes incomplete .",
    "the atesp counts can thus provide an useful observational constraint on the evolutionary models for the mjy and sub  mjy populations .",
    "in the same region lies the eis ( eso imaging survey , nonino et al . 1999 ) patch a ( 3.2 sq . degr . ) , consisting of deep images in the i band out of which a galaxy catalogue to i=22.5 has been extracted . for 218 out of 384 radio sources ( @xmath21 mjy ) in 2.97",
    "square degrees of the eis - a an optical identification was found ; we obtained spectra at the eso 3.6 m telescope of a complete sample of 69 galaxies brighter than i = 19.0 . the high signal to noise ratio of",
    "these spectra permits an unambiguous spectral classification of the whole sample .",
    "we divided the galaxy - identifications into several standard groups ; this classification , based on spectral type , essentially distinguishes between agns , which , for weak radio sources , are mostly elliptical galaxies without strong emission lines ( although also a few seyfert type spectra are present ) , and starburst galaxies ( mccall et al . 1985 ) , which are often spiral galaxies in a particularly active phase of star formation . as expected , we found a number of these starburst galaxies , which are characterized by high excitation @xmath22 region - like spectra , but also some post - starbursts .",
    "the latter have either strong @xmath23 absorption on top of a k - type spectrum without emission lines , or show @xmath24 and @xmath25 in emission and higher order lines ( from @xmath23 on ) strong but in absorption .",
    "in addition some spectra are characteristic of galaxy disks of late type spirals : in those cases some emission is present ( [ oiii],[oii],@xmath24 and nii ) but at a lower level than in the starburst galaxies .",
    "finally , one typical liner ( heckman 1980 ) was found .",
    "figure 2 shows the redshift distribution of the different spectral classes .",
    "the mean redshift distribution of the whole sample is z=0.20 ; in particular starburst and post - starburst galaxies are nearer than ellipticals , in good agreement with the results from first ( magliocchetti et al .",
    "lrrrrrr + & & & + & & & + & & & & & & + ell+liner & 34 & ( 50% ) & 7 & ( 29% ) & 27 & ( 60% ) + agn & 5 & ( 7% ) & 1 & ( 4% ) & 4 & ( 9% ) + spiral disks & 14 & ( 20% ) & 6 & ( 25% ) & 8 & ( 18% ) + sb + post - sb & 16 & ( 23% ) & 10 & ( 42% ) & 6 & ( 13% ) + all & 69 & & 24 & ( 35% ) & 45 & ( 65% ) + & & & & & & +    the faint radio source composition resulting from the atesp - eis spectroscopic sample classification is presented in table  1 , where sub - mjy and mjy regimes have been considered separately .",
    "we notice that the good quality of the spectra allowed us to classify all objects ( in previous spectroscopic studies of sub - mjy samples about 15 - 20@xmath1 of the objects were not classified due to poor spectroscopy ) .",
    "+ our data clearly show that the agn contribution does not significantly change going to fainter fluxes ( from 9% to 4% ) , that early - type galaxies largely dominate ( 60% ) the mjy population , while star - formation processes become important in the sub - mjy regime : sb and post - sb galaxies go from 13% at @xmath26 mjy to 42% at @xmath27 mjy .",
    "nevertheless , at sub - mjy fluxes , early - type galaxies still constitute a significant fraction ( 29% ) of the whole population . as shown in fig .  3 where we plot the radio flux densities against the i magnitudes for the whole sample",
    ", this seems to be particularly true going to fainter magnitudes .",
    "in fact at @xmath28 40% ( @xmath29 ) of the sub - mjy sources are early - type galaxies ( circles ) and the fraction of starburst galaxies ( stars ) in only 20% ( @xmath30 ) .    the latter result , even though based on a very small number of objects , is in agreement with the result obtained from the analysis of the marano field sub - mjy sample ( gruppioni et al .",
    "1999a ) , and suggests that star - forming galaxies dominate the sub - mjy population only at bright magnitudes .",
    "deeper spectroscopy for the atesp - eis sample will be crucial in order to verify this indication on a reliable statistical basis .",
    "3 also indicates a possible physical interpretation of this result : star - forming galaxies are characterized by smaller radio to optical ratios ( @xmath31 ) , that is have weaker intrinsic radio emission , than early - type galaxies ( @xmath32 ) . if this behaviour holds going to fainter fluxes , a larger fraction of star - forming galaxies is expected in @xmath5jy samples .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by the study of the @xmath5jy sources in the hubble deep field , the majority of which seem to be associated with star - forming galaxies ( richards et al .",
    "in order to improve our knowledge of the sub - mjy population it is crucial to obtain deeper optical images and/or fainter radio samples .",
    "the first step will be to analyze the ubvri images of deep-1 field ( eis survey ) which overlaps a subregion of the atesp survey . at a limiting magnitude of about i=26 we estimate to indentify 70 - 80@xmath1 of the 135 radio sources present in the field .",
    "furthermore the same region will be observed at 5 ghz with the atca ; radio spectral index and radio source structure will provide important clues on the nature of sub - mjy sources and put strong observational constraints on evolutionary models .",
    "the next step is to have a @xmath33 sample with high quality spectroscopy ; the vla data at 1.4 ghz for the deep field of the virmos spectroscopic survey ( le fevre , these proceedings ) fulfill these requirments ."
