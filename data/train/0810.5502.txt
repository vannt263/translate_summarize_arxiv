    "the problem of explaining the emergence of self - organized , macroscopic , patterns from a limited set of rules governing the mutual interaction of a large assembly of microscopic actors , is often faced in several domains of physics and biology .",
    "this challenging task defines the realm of complex systems , and calls for novel paradigms to efficiently intersect distinct expertise .",
    "population dynamics has indeed attracted many scientists @xcite and dedicated models were put forward to reproduce in silico the change in population over time as displayed in real ecosystems ( including humans ) .",
    "two opposite tendencies are in particular to be accomodated for . on the one hand , microscopic agents do reproduce themselves with a specific rate @xmath0 , an effect which translates into a growth of the population size @xmath1 . on the other ,",
    "competition for the available resources ( and death ) yields a compression of the population . in a seminal work by verhulst @xcite",
    ", these ingredients were formalized in the differential equation : @xmath2 @xmath3 is the so called carrying capacity and identifies the maximum allowed population for a selected organism , under specific environmental conditions .",
    "the above model predicts an early exponential growth , which is subsequently antagonized by the quadratic contribution , responsible for the asymptotic saturation .",
    "the adequacy of the verhulst s model was repeatedly tested versus laboratory experiments : colonies of bacteria , yeast or other simple organic entities were grown , while monitoring the time evolution of the population amount . in some cases , an excellent agreement @xcite with the theory was reported , thus supporting the biological validity of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ver ] ) .",
    "conversely , the match with the theory was definetely less satisfying for e.g. fruit flies , flour beetles and in general for other organisms that rely on a more complex life cycle .",
    "for those latter , it is necessary to invoke a somehow richer modelling scenario which esplicitly includes age structures and time delayed effects of overcrowding population @xcite . for",
    "a more deailed account on these issues the interested reader can refer to the review paper @xcite and references therein .",
    "clearly , initial conditions are crucial and need to be accurately determined .",
    "an error in assessing the initial population , might reflect in the estimates of the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath3 , which are tuned so to adjust theoretical and experimental data .",
    "in general , the initial condition relative to one specific experimental realization could be seen as randomly extracted from a given distribution .",
    "this , somehow natural , viewpoint is elaborated in this paper and its implications for the analysis of the experiments thoroughly explored .",
    "in particular we shall focus on the setting where @xmath4 independent population communities are ( sequentially or simultaneously ) made to evolve .",
    "the experiment here consists in measuring collective observables , as the average population and associated momenta of the ensemble distribution .",
    "as anticipated , sensitivity to initial condition do play a crucial role and so need to be properly addressed when aiming at establishing a link with ( averaged ) ensemble measurements , or , equivalently , drawing reliable forecast . to this end",
    ", we will here develop two analytical approaches which enable us to reconstruct the sought distribution .",
    "the first , to which section [ sec : momevo ] is devoted , aims at obtaining a complete description of the momenta , as e.g. the mean population amount .",
    "this is an observable of paramount importance , potentially accessible in real experiments .",
    "the second , discussed in section [ sec : pdfevo ] , introduces a master equation which rules the evolution of the relevant distribution .",
    "it should be remarked that this latter approach is a priori more general then the former , as the momenta can in principle be calculated on the basis of the recovered distribution",
    ". however , computational difficulties are often to be faced which make the analysis rather intricate . in this perspective",
    "the two proposed scenario are to be regarded as highly complementary .    in the following , for practical purposes",
    ", we shall assume each population to evolve as prescribed by a verhulst type of equation .",
    "the methods here developed are however not limited to this case study but can be straightforwardly generalized to settings were other , possibly more complex , dynamical schemes are put forward .",
    "imagine to label with @xmath5 the population relative to the @xmath6-th realization , belonging to the ensemble of @xmath4 independent replica .",
    "as previosuly recalled , we assume each @xmath5 to obey a first order differential equation of the logistic type , namely : @xmath7 that can be straightforwardly obtained from  ( [ eq : ver ] ) by setting @xmath8 and renaming the time @xmath9 . the initial condition will be denoted by @xmath10 .",
    "a natural question concerns the expected output of an hypothetic set of experiments constrained as above .",
    "more concretely , can we describe the distribution of possible solutions , once the collection of initial data is entirely specified ?",
    "the @xmath11-th momentum associated to the discrete distribution of @xmath4 repeated measurements acquired at time @xmath12 reads : @xmath13    to reach our goal , we introduce the _ time dependent moment generating function _",
    ", @xmath14 , @xmath15 this is a formal power series whose taylor coefficients are the momenta of the distribution that we are willing to reconstruct , task that can be accomplished using the following relation : @xmath16    by exploiting the evolution s law for each @xmath5 , we shall here obtain a partial differential equation governing the behavior of @xmath17 .",
    "knowing @xmath17 will eventually enables us to calculate any sought momentum via multiple differentiation with respect to @xmath18 as stated in  ( [ eq : momen ] ) .    deriving  ( [ eq : mmom2 ] ) and making use of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ver1 ] ) immediately yields :    @xmath19    on the other hand , by differentiating  ( [ eq : formf ] ) with respect to time , one obtains : @xmath20 where used has been made of eq .",

    "( [ eq : momen ] ) ) and for all positive @xmath12 . to this end",
    "we shall specify the initial datum : @xmath27 i.e. the initial momenta or their distribution .    before turning to solve  ( [ eq : forf ] ) ,",

    "in this section we will focus on a particular case study in the aim of clarifying the potential interest of our findings .",

    "no prior information is hence available which favours one specific choice , all accessible initial data being equally probably . to fix the ideas we shall here set @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",

    "[ fig:1mom ] direct numerical simulations are compared to the analytical solution  ( [ eq : ameda2t]a ) , returning a good agreement .",
    "a naive approach would suggest interpolating the averaged numerical profile with a solution of the logistic model whose initial datum @xmath66 acts as a free parameter to be adjusted to its best fitted value . as testified by visual inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig:1mom ] this procedure yields a significant discrepancy , which could be possibly misinterpreted as a failure of the underlying logistic evolution law . for this reason , and to avoid drawing erroneous conclusions when ensemble averages are computed , attention has to be payed on the role of initial conditions .    .",

    "( [ eq : ver1 ] ) ) .",
    "one could therefore imagine to proceed with a fitting strategy which adjusts both @xmath66 and @xmath0 so to match the ( averaged ) data .",
    "alternatively , and provided the distribution of initial conditions is assigned ( here assumed uniform ) , one could involve the explicit solution  ( [ eq : ameda2t]a ) where time is scaled back to ist original value :    @xmath69    and let the solely parameter @xmath0 to run freely so to search for the optimal agreement with the data . as an example",

    "as opposed to the above procedure , one may focus on the distribution function of expected outputs , rather then computing its momenta .",
    "the starting point of the analysis relies on a generalized version of the celebrated liouville theorem .",
    "this latter asserts that the phase - space distribution function @xmath89 is constant along the trajectory of the system . for a non hamiltonian system this condition results in the following equation ( for convenience derived in the appendix  [ sec : app ] ) for the evolution of the probability density function under the action of a generic ordinary differential equation , here represented by the vector field @xmath90 :    @xmath91    where @xmath92 .    for the case under inspection",
