    "the moving carriers in a metallic system , electrons or holes , transport both electric charge and heat .",
    "this gives rise to a number of thermoelectric effects as well as a deep connection between thermal and electrical conductivities .",
    "a well known example is the wiedemann - franz law , which states that the ratio of the thermal to the electrical conductivity is the temperature times a universal number , the lorenz number @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the boltzmann constant and the unit charge . from the theoretical standpoint",
    "the validity of the above law relies on the single - particle description of transport , on the fermi statistics of carriers and on the assumption of purely elastic scattering @xcite .",
    "when electron - electron interaction is present as in a fermi liquid , this law still holds provided the quasiparticles do not exchange energy during collisions . at low temperatures",
    "the combination of electron - electron interaction and disorder may change this picture @xcite .",
    "additionally , a magnetic field affects both thermal and electrical transport yielding both galvanomagnetic and thermomagnetic effects @xcite .",
    "the above situation gets even more complicated when a third quantity transported by the carriers  the spin  is connected to the previous two by spin - orbit ( so ) coupling . on the bright side",
    ", such a connection also opens up a plethora of new possibilities related to the manipulation of the additional spin degrees of freedom .",
    "this is testified by the recent rapid development of spintronics @xcite and spin caloritronics @xcite",
    ". a fundamental goal of spintronics is the achievement of all - electrical control of the carriers spin , made possible by so coupling as exemplified by the spin hall effect @xcite .",
    "similarly , an important goal of spin caloritronics is the manipulation of the spin degrees of freedom via thermal gradients @xcite , particularly relevant when energy efficiency issues are considered @xcite . in this context",
    "a noteworthy phenomenon is the spin seebeck effect : a spin current thermally generated in a ( metallic or insulating ) ferromagnet is injected into a normal metal and there , via the inverse spin hall effect , it generates an observable voltage drop in the direction orthogonal to the applied thermal gradient @xcite . in this",
    "much studied case phonons and magnons play the leading roles @xcite .",
    "there are on the other hand only few works on thermo - spin transport due to the charge carriers dynamics @xcite , and we wish to address this issue considering disordered fermi gases with so coupling .",
    "we will see that a general relation between the spin - heat and spin - charge response of such systems can be obtained , with the same range of applicability of the wiedemann - franz law .",
    "moreover , we will discuss the particular case of the thermo - spin hall effect  the generation of a spin current transverse to a thermal gradient , also called the spin nernst effect . in so doing",
    "we will show that a simple relation connects the spin thermopower ",
    "the ratio between the spin response to a thermal gradient and that to an electric field  to the standard electric thermopower , and that the former can be strongly enhanced by the interplay between different so coupling mechanisms .",
    "let us start with some basic phenomenological considerations along the lines of refs .  , and consider the bare - bones situation of an inversion symmetric , homogeneous and non - ferromagnetic material in the absence of magnetic fields .",
    "a particle current @xmath5 can be driven either by an electric field or by a temperature gradient , and within the standard semiclassical approach one writes @xcite @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the drude conductivity up to a charge @xmath8 , with @xmath9 the density of states at the fermi energy and @xmath10 the diffusion constant , and @xmath11 , @xmath12 being the chemical potential .",
    "the ratio @xmath13 is the electric thermopower . in the present simple case the connection between spin and particle currents due to",
    "so coupling reads @xcite @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the @xmath16-polarized spin current flowing in the @xmath17 direction arising in response to the particle current @xmath5 , and @xmath18 is a dimensionless so coupling constant . as an immediate consequence of eqs .",
    "( [ phenom1 ] ) and ( [ phenom2 ] ) , the spin thermopower @xmath19 is equal to @xmath20 , since the so coupling constant @xmath21 does not depend on the sources of a given particle current .",
    ".   breaks down in the absence of inversion symmetry , and in order to see how the above simple result is modified in a general situation , and to study its dependence on competing so coupling mechanisms , we will move on to a microscopic treatment .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the formalism is introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec_basic ] and put to use in sec .  [ sec_spin_mott ] to obtain the general formula for the spin - thermopower @xmath22 .",
    "the latter appears as the spin equivalent of mott s formula for the electric thermopower . in order to lend concreteness to the presentation",
    ", the derivation of @xmath22 is done using the linear rashba model as a template . in sec .",
    "[ sec_appl ] we apply our formula to a series of different systems and discuss its experimental relevance , before concluding in sec .",
    "[ sec_conclusions ] .",
    "a number of technical details regarding the matsubara technique are presented in the appendix .",
    "though our treatment is independent of dimensions ( 2d or 3d ) , in order to fix things we consider a disordered 2d fermi gas in the @xmath23-@xmath17 plane described by the hamiltonian @xmath24 with @xmath25 the 2d momentum and @xmath26 the impurity potential . for the latter we assume the standard white noise disorder model and evaluate the impurity average in the born approximation , @xmath27 , with @xmath28 and @xmath29 the elastic scattering time",
    "the so term @xmath30 will have different forms in the various cases considered below . in the ( linear ) rashba case it reads @xmath31 with @xmath32 a coupling constant .",
    "we assume the metallic regime and weak so coupling conditions , @xmath33 . here",
    "@xmath34 is the fermi energy in the absence of disorder and so interaction and @xmath35 is the so splitting due to @xmath30 . from now on @xmath36 .",

    "the heat current in the matsubara representation reads @xmath46 with @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "the specific form of @xmath43 depends on the choice of the so hamiltonian .",
    "for instance in the rashba case , eq.([eq2 ] ) , we have @xmath49 . by using the kubo formula",
    "the response kernel is given by @xmath50^a_{kl}({\\rm i}\\omega_{\\nu } ) = t\\sum_{\\epsilon_n , \\bf p } { \\rm i } \\epsilon_{n+\\nu/2 }   { \\rm tr}\\left [ j^a_k { { \\cal g}}_n j_l{{\\cal g}}_{n+\\nu}\\right],\\ ] ] where the matsubara green functions @xmath51 , @xmath52 are matrices in spin space @xmath53 .",
    "analogously , the spin - charge response kernel can be written as @xmath54^a_{kl}({\\rm i}\\omega_{\\nu } ) = -e t \\sum_{\\epsilon_n,\\bf p}{\\rm",
    "tr}\\left [ j^a_k { { \\cal g}}_n j_l{{\\cal g}}_{n+\\nu}\\right],\\ ] ] leading to the spin - charge ( particle ) conductivity @xmath55^a_{kl}= \\lim_{\\omega \\rightarrow 0 } \\left\\ { \\frac{\\left[q_{\\rm sc}({\\rm i}\\omega_{\\nu})\\right]^a_{kl}}{\\omega_{\\nu } } \\right\\}_{{\\rm i}\\omega_{\\nu}\\rightarrow \\omega^r , \\   \\omega^r=\\omega + { \\rm i}0^+}.\\ ] ]",
    "although our treatment is general , to illustrate the procedure we take the rashba case as an example . the average over disorder is evaluated in the born approximation and leads to a self - energy @xmath56 which is diagonal in spin space . as it can be seen from eq.([eq2 ] ) for the rashba case , the off - diagonal terms in spin space of the green function are odd in the momentum dependence and vanish upon integration .",
    "this remains valid also for other spin - orbit interaction terms as long as the hamiltonian is time - reversal invariant .    to compute the thermo - spin hall effect .",
    "i.e. the @xmath16-polarized spin current flowing along @xmath17 generated by a thermal gradient along @xmath23 , we need the response kernel @xmath57^z_{yx}\\equiv q^{sh}$ ] , which reads @xmath58,\\ ] ] with @xmath59 and @xmath60 , whereas @xmath61^{-1},\\ ] ] @xmath12 being the chemical potential .",
    "notice that the analytic properties of the green functions are determined by the sign of the imaginary frequency , therefore when performing the momentum integral in eq.([eq6 ] ) one obtains a non - zero result only if the frequencies @xmath62 and @xmath63 have opposite signs , which means that @xmath63 is restricted to the range @xmath64 . exploiting that the external frequency is going to zero ( cf .",
    "eq.([kappa_sh ] ) ) one thus has @xmath65 = -\\frac{2\\pi}{e}\\left[\\sigma_{\\rm sc}\\right]^a_{kl}(\\mu+{\\rm i}\\epsilon_n).\\ ] ] this last result is derived in the appendix more in detail .",
    "eq.([eq6 ] ) only takes into account the so - called bare bubble .",
    "vertex corrections @xcite will be considered later . according to eq .",
    "( [ sum_p ] ) we now have @xmath66 = -\\frac{2\\pi}{e}\\sigma^{sh}(\\mu+{\\rm i}\\epsilon_n),\\ ] ] with @xmath67 the static spin - hall conductivity from ref .  .",
    "the thermo - spin hall conductivity therefore reads @xmath68_{{\\rm i } \\omega_{\\nu}\\rightarrow \\omega^r},\\ ] ] and , after expanding in @xmath63 as shown in the appendix , yields @xmath69 to connect this result with that of ref .  ,",
    "in which @xmath70 is computed in the clean limit , @xmath71 , we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ cgrashba ] ) @xmath72^{-1},\\ ] ] and note that , as long as the temperature is finite , in the @xmath71 limit the poles are @xmath73 away form the real axis .",
    "thus the effective replacement @xmath74 in eq.([eq9 ] ) yields the clean limit result @xmath75 in agreement with ref .  .",
    "let us now discuss the vertex corrections .",
    "taking them into account corresponds to sending @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 . at the level of the born approximation",
    "either vertex could be renormalized : the bubble with @xmath79 and @xmath80 or that with @xmath15 and @xmath81 are equivalent .",
    "moreover , since we neglect inelastic processes , @xmath82 . for the rashba case it is known that @xmath83 , i.e. @xmath84 , and thus we immediately obtain @xmath85 however , notice that eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) holds for any form of the so interaction term @xmath30 , no matter whether of intrinsic or extrinsic nature .",
    "therefore , once the spin - hall conductivity @xmath86 of a given system is known , its thermo - spin hall conductivity @xmath87 will follow at once . even more generally , from the matsubara formulation , eqs .",
    "( [ kappa_sh])-([sum_p ] ) , we conclude that the spin - heat response of a disordered , so coupled fermi gas in the metallic regime is completely determined by its spin - charge response .",
    "this result holds in 2d and 3d , in the presence of arbitrary elastic scattering processes , possibly spin - dependent , and beyond the born approximation , i.e. it has the same range of applicability of the wiedemann - franz law discussed in ref .  .",
    "this is the first main result of our work , which , after a sommerfeld expansion , can be written in the very simple form @xmath88 in other words mott s formula for the electric thermopower @xmath89 has its symmetric spin equivalent @xmath90 whether a direct relation between @xmath22 and @xmath20 exists is however not obvious and will be one of our next concerns .",
    "specializing our treatment to some specific systems , we now have a two - fold aim : ( i ) to look for the possibility of efficient heath - to - spin conversion , @xmath91 ; ( ii ) to establish a relation , if any , between @xmath22 and @xmath20 .    with this in mind ,",
    "let us now take @xmath30 to be linear in momentum , in which case the spin continuity equations assume a particularly simple form .",
    "this allows one to easily draw a set of more specific conclusions concerning the thermo - spin response of the 2d fermi gas , in particular regarding the interplay between different so and scattering mechanisms . to be explicit",
    "we take once more the disordered rashba model as the initial example , and consider the presence of extrinsic so mechanisms and ( white noise ) magnetic impurities .",
    "that is , we add to the hamiltonian ( [ eq1 ] ) the terms @xmath92 with @xmath93 an effective compton wavelength , and @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a random ( white noise ) magnetic field .",

    "depend on the ratio between @xmath115 and @xmath116 and are in principle tunable , either by varying the doping , which affects @xmath116 , or by modulating @xmath32 by varying the gate potential .",
    "let us consider some interesting cases using eq .",
    "( [ sigma_sh ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ kappa_sh ] ) .",
    "when only rashba so and magnetic impurities are present , we have @xmath117 and @xmath118 . by evaluating the various derivatives we obtain @xmath119 , which gives us the spin thermopower @xmath120 when so from impurities is present , too , the terms @xmath121 in eq .",

    "the results are thus plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig ] , and show the sensitivity of the spin thermopower to the various physical parameters in play .",
    "a modest modulation of the rashba coupling constant could substantially modify @xmath22 , either enhancing or decreasing it depending on the system s characteristics  we considered ratios @xmath126 well within current experimental capabilities @xcite .",
    "we will come back to this point in a moment .     of a disordered 2d - electron gas with numerous competing so mechanisms .",
    "typical values for gaas quantum wells are : mobility @xmath127 , density @xmath128 , effective extrinsic wavelength @xmath129 , dresselhaus coupling constant @xmath130 .",
    "there follows @xmath131 .",
    "the rashba coupling constant can be modulated by the gate potential @xcite .",
    "each panel shows the ratio @xmath132 as a function of the ratio @xmath126 for a given elliot - yafet scattering strength , strong to weak from top left to bottom right  panel 3 corresponds to standard gaas .",
    "magnetic scattering is strongest for the dotted curve , @xmath133 , and strong ( weak ) for the dashed ( solid ) curves , @xmath134 . ]",
    "let us now consider our final example , a 2d hole gas as analyzed in ref .  .",
    "the so interaction is cubic in momentum @xmath135 + \\alpha_h\\sigma_y\\left[p_x\\left(3p^2_y -p^2_x\\right)\\right],\\ ] ] and the spin hall conductivity reads @xcite @xmath136 with @xmath137 @xcite . proceeding as before one gets @xmath138.\\ ] ] all previous result can be cast in the simple form @xmath139 with @xmath1 a number which depends on the various competing so mechanisms .",
    "eq .  , which is our second main result , looks physically quite reasonable : in a metallic system in which electrons ( or holes ) are the sole carriers of charge , spin and heat , the heat - to - spin and heat - to - charge ( particle ) conversions are expected to be closely related .",
    "the examples considered show however that @xmath140 could be easily achieved : in standard gaas samples with rashba so and extrinsic mechanisms one may estimate @xmath141 @xcite , and the same value is obtained in a two - dimensional hole gas with purely cubic rashba so in the diffusive regime ( @xmath142 ) . if dresselhaus so is also taken into account , similar values could be achieved , as shown in fig .",
    "this suggests that metallic systems , typically characterized by low thermoelectric efficiencies , could be much more efficient in heat - to - spin conversion and therefore play a front role in spin caloritronics .",
    "of course , whether substantially higher @xmath1 values can be reached in different systems , e.g. in transition metals which already show a giant spin hall response @xcite , or more exotic ones such as @xmath143-doped graphene @xcite or topological insulators like hgte @xcite , is an open and relevant question .",
    "indeed , it would be interesting to establish whether it is always possible , within the regime in which the general expression holds , to find such a simple connection between @xmath22 and @xmath20 .",
    "we therefore believe it desirable to experimentally test eq .  .",
    "this could be done rather straightforwardly in a setup like the one employed to first observe the spin hall effect @xcite : at low temperatures , the spin accumulation at the side edges of a two - dimensional fermi gas could be optically measured first in response to a longitudinally applied bias , and then to a small temperature gradient along the same direction .",
    "all - electrical measurement schemes based on h - bar geometries , exchanging again the applied bias with a temperature difference , would also be interesting though probably more delicate : in this case a temperature gradient along the side leg of the h - bar should be avoided or its effects compensated . finally , it is well known that mott s formula can be heavily affected by inelastic processes .",
    "though the latter are beyond the scope of the present work , it would be interesting to study their effects on @xmath22 and see whether any similarities between electric and spin thermopower exist also in their presence or not .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied coupled spin and thermal transport in a disordered and so coupled fermi gas , and shown the existence of a general expression for the spin thermopower @xmath22 with the same structure and an identical range of validity of mott s formula for the electric thermopower @xmath20 . finally , we have derived a simple and physically transparent relation connecting the two quantities which could be experimentally tested and suggests that metallic systems could be much more efficient in heat - to - spin than in heat - to - charge conversion .",

    "<S> we study the connection between the spin - heat and spin - charge response in a disordered fermi gas with spin - orbit coupling . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the ratio between the above responses can be expressed as the thermopower @xmath0 times a number @xmath1 which depends on the strength and type of the spin - orbit couplings considered . </S>",
    "<S> the general results are illustrated by examining different two - dimensional electron or hole systems with different and competing spin - orbit mechanisms , and we conclude that a metallic system could prove much more efficient as a heat - to - spin than as a heat - to - charge converter . </S>"
