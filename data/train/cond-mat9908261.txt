    "the formation of midgap states@xcite ( mgs ) at surfaces and interfaces of @xmath0-wave superconductors affects the current transport properties of junctions involving @xmath0-wave superconductors .",
    "it has been established@xcite that the zero - bias conductance peak ( zbcp ) seen in normal metal/@xmath0-wave superconductor ( n/@xmath0 ) junctions , are due to the mgs . for the ac josephson effect it was shown@xcite that subharmonic gap structure ( sgs )",
    "is in general different in @xmath0-wave junctions compared to @xmath3-wave junctions . in ref .",
    "it was shown that mgs produce current peaks at voltages of the order of the maximum gap , while in ref .",
    "also a singularity at zero bias was found .",
    "later on , in ref .  , it was pointed out that this structure was not seen in ref .  , because the scattering theory did not include broadening effects . numerical calculations@xcite including broadening confirmed the picture outlined in ref .  .",
    "despite all the interest in the ac josephson effect for @xmath0-wave junctions , the physics behind the current peaks has not been fully understood .",
    "recently , a scattering theory based approach@xcite has successfully explained sgs in conventional ( @xmath3-wave ) junctions for arbitrary transparency of the barrier : it agrees for one - channel junctions with experiments@xcite without fitting parameters . in a recent reformulation@xcite of the theory",
    "it was shown that only currents from multi - particle processes creating real excitations need to be summed up , since non - physical currents , present in the original formulation of the theory , cancels .",
    "this proves that the pauli exclusion principle is fulfilled .    in this paper",
    "we extend the reformulated scattering theory described above to junctions of @xmath0-wave superconductors and provide a deeper analysis of the sgs and the effects of mgs .",
    "considering transport in the @xmath4-plane , we model the @xmath5 junction ( @xmath6 is the orientation angle of the left / right superconductor@xcite ) as described in ref .  .",
    "this reference also provides a detailed description of the method we use to solve the time - dependent bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equation .",
    "a quasiparticle incident on the junction at energy @xmath7 undergoes multiple andreev reflections and builds up a scattering state with amplitudes at the sideband energies @xmath8 ( v is the voltage ; @xmath1 integer ) .",
    "it can be shown that the probability current @xmath9 leaking out at sideband @xmath10 determines the @xmath1-particle current @xmath2 . at zero temperature",
    "we have@xcite @xmath11    & & \\hspace{3cm}\\times\\left[(1-|a_n|^2)+ ( 1-|{\\bar a}_n|^2)|a_nr_{n+}|^2\\right],\\label{eq : current}\\\\ & & g_{n0 }   = \\frac{t_{n0}}{(1-a_0{\\bar a}_0r_{0-}r_{n0 } ) ( 1-a_n{\\bar a}_nr_{n+}{\\tilde r}_{n0})- a_0{\\bar a}_0a_n{\\bar a}_nr_{0-}r_{n+}t_{n0}{\\tilde t}_{n0}},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 . above ,",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath14 are the andreev reflection amplitudes for the angle @xmath15 at energies @xmath16 and @xmath10 respectively ( the barred amplitudes are calculated at @xmath17 ) ; @xmath18 and @xmath19 describe reflections from minus and plus infinity in energy space ; @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are the elements of the scattering matrix describing the region between the injection point and the exit point .",
    "the weight @xmath1 of @xmath2 appears because the @xmath1-particle process involves an effective transfer of the charge @xmath24 over the junction .",
    "analyzing the current in eq .",
    "( [ eq : current ] ) , we see that resonances may appear in the propagator @xmath25 , which describes the transmission process from energy @xmath7 to @xmath10 .",
    "there are two types of resonances : bare transmission resonances ( appearing in @xmath20 ) and boundary resonances ( due to the denominator ) .",
    "a bare transmission resonance may appear when the trajectory hits a bound state at the is interface , so called de gennes state . in a short @xmath26 junction ( as in the short @xmath3-wave junction ) the de gennes states are located at the gap edges , giving rise to the usual sgs at the voltages @xmath27 . in the @xmath3-wave",
    "case@xcite the sgs is due to the combination of onset of the @xmath1-particle current and resonances in the @xmath28-particle current ( due to an overlap of a bare transmission resonance and a boundary resonance ) and the @xmath29-particle current ( two overlapping bare transmission resonances ) . for",
    "the @xmath26 case [ see fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ] the physics behind the sgs is the same , but for two reasons the structure is smeared and suppressed .",
    "first , there are no real onsets ( the @xmath0-wave gap has nodes ) , meaning that the @xmath30-particle current background dominates at all voltages . in addition",
    ", the resonances in the higher order currents are not sharp because of angular averaging .",
    "rotating the right @xmath0-wave gap away from the @xmath31 orientation , the de gennes states are moved from the gap edges to zero energy ( mgs ) for those angles where the gap changes sign after normal reflection at the junction . the bare transmission resonance is then moved and , in addition , the boundary resonances are lost for quasiparticles injected from the right superconductor .",
    "this result in a drastically changed sgs : for the @xmath32 junction [ see fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ] the only surviving structure is at @xmath33 and it is mainly due to the @xmath34-particle current : an overlap between the bare mgs resonance and boundary resonances ( near the left gap edges ) produces the peak .",
    "this happens also in the @xmath35 junction@xcite .",
    "we introduce , on a phenomenological level , inelastic scattering into the problem by adding a small imaginary part @xmath36 to the quasiparticle energy , which results in broadening of all resonances . for the @xmath32 junction , a small current peak",
    "is then revealed near zero bias , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "the peak is due to resonances in particle currents of order @xmath37 and higher and was therefore not discussed in connection to the tunnel limit calculations in ref .   and .",
    "when mgs are present on both sides of the junction ( the @xmath38 junction ) boundary resonances can never appear .",
    "consequently current peaks are not seen in the iv - characteristics@xcite , leaving only an onset of the current at @xmath33 ( due to the bare mgs resonance ) .",
    "again , introducing broadening reveals a peak near zero bias , see fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) we show that processes of many orders are in this case contributing to the peak .    in recent experiments@xcite on bicrystal grain boundary junctions of hole - doped",
    "cuprates a zbcp was seen for all orientations of the superconductors .",
    "no real sgs was seen , only a gap - like structure at @xmath33 .",
    "our predicitions agree with the experimental results , apart from that negative differential conductance was not found in the experiments . in another",
    "experiment@xcite weak sgs ( altough not perfectly at @xmath39 ) was observed for edge junctions with the @xmath26 orientation , as we also report here .",
    "dividing the current into @xmath1-particle currents , we have shown which physical processes are giving rise to sgs and current peaks near zero bias .",
    "for orientations where no mgs are present in the junction the sgs is at @xmath39 as in the @xmath3-wave case .",
    "when mgs are present on at least one side of the junction sgs is lost and a current peak appears near zero bias ( if we include broadening into the formalism ) .",
    "currents of high orders are contributing to this peak .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank v. s. shumeiko for many useful discussions on this work . economic support from nutek and nfr ( sweden ) and nedo ( japan )",
    "is gratefully acknowledged ."
