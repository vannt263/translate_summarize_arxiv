    "the current paradigm of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) includes a central source that comprises a super - massive black hole ( smbh ) surrounded by an accretion disk @xcite . through this accretion disk",
    ", material gets funnelled into the smbh @xcite .",
    "quasars are the most luminous class of agn with bolometric luminosities of up to @xmath4 .",
    "photoionization by radiation from the accretion disk is thought to be the main mechanism through which gas in agns is ionized @xcite .",
    "studying the interactions between the ionizing photons and the material they encounter allows us to study the physical conditions in the ionized regions .",
    "for example , the presence of narrow forbidden lines in quasar spectra points to a region that has low density and is located relatively far from the black hole s sphere of influence",
    ". for the most part , the gas in the nlr region responds kinematically to the gravitational potential of the galaxy as a whole and therefore produces narrower emission lines ( fwhm @xmath5 @xmath6 )  hence its label . on the other hand , in the close vicinity of the central source ( @xmath7 1 pc ) , the gas mainly feels the gravitational influence of the smbh and therefore produces emission lines that are primarily doppler - broadened with widths of 1000s km / s .",
    "we therefore call this region the broad - line region ( blr ) .",
    "though the broad and narrow - line regions are physically distinct , correlations between properties of the two regions are found in the literature .",
    "most well - known are the so - called eigenvector 1 relations , first identified by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bg92 ) from principal component analysis of several spectral measurements of the low - redshift pg quasar sample .",
    "bg92 found that narrow h@xmath0  width , strong fe  ii  emission , and weak [ o  iii ]  emission tended to be found in the same objects .",
    "the strong eigenvector 1 objects have also been identified as having relatively high @xmath8 values ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "given our understanding of the rather different origins of blr and nlr emission , the linking of broad- and narrow - line spectral properties is puzzling , and the extended discussion in bg92 reflects this conceptual difficulty .    to first order , the nlr can be described as the diffuse interstellar medium of the host galaxy illuminated by the accretion disk continuum .",
    "quasar nlrs are therefore the regions where we expect the interactions between agns and their host galaxies to take place ; the narrow emission lines are among the few tracers of the host galaxy that are evident in optical quasar spectra .",
    "it is therefore important to check that any apparent links between broad and narrow - line region spectral properties do not arise from secondary and unintentional selection effects of host galaxies .",
    "for example , the strong eigenvector 1 objects are necessarily low redshift ( because of the lines used in the study ) , and therefore low luminosity . the original bg92 sample were all pg quasars , which because of their selection are not representative of the quasar population as a whole @xcite .",
    "therefore , we are interested in studying samples of quasars with very similar central engines across a range of redshift to determine if we can isolate the effects of host galaxy evolution on nlr emission . with the large quasar properties catalogue of @xcite with 105,783 objects , this hypothesis can be tested by selecting similar types of quasars ( in terms of @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) , and examining their narrow - line region properties independently .    throughout this work",
    "we use : @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the initial sample is selected from the @xcite catalogue of quasar properties ( sdss - dr7 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we restrict the sample to radio - quiet quasars ( defined in the catalogue as objects with @xmath12 ; where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the radio and optical flux densities observed at 6 cm and 2500   respectively ) .",
    "we also impose a redshift limit of @xmath15 to ensure @xmath16   is in our spectral range .",
    "this emission - line - free segment of the continuum is used to first normalize the spectra and later to calculate the relative line luminosities of the composites .",
    "the final sample contains @xmath17 spectra .",
    "we utilize the oh - subtracted spectra of @xcite who constructed a set of the telluric - line - cleaned spectra ( specifically around h@xmath0 ) .",
    "we then apply iraf s deredden tool to correct the spectra for galactic extinction using the @xmath18 values provided in the catalogue ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "finally , the spectra are shifted to the rest frame using the @xcite redshift determination as provided in @xcite .",
    "one of the advantages of starting from a large homogeneous dataset like the sdss quasar sample is the ability to stack objects to create higher signal - to - noise spectra which then allows us to examine weaker features ( such as the high ip [ ne  v ]  line ) that are otherwise hard to measure ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to make sure we are identifying objects with similar agn properties , we group objects according to their continuum luminosities at 5100   ( @xmath19 ) and the fwhm of h@xmath0 , we mean the broad component of the line from which a narrow - line component has been subtracted",
    "] as reported in @xcite .",
    "these two quantities are often used in combination in the literature to estimate more physical properties of the agn such as the mass of the smbh and the accretion rate ( * ? ? ? * and references therein , see also  [ measurements ] ) .",
    "we used the measured properties ( luminosity and balmer - line broad - line width ) rather than derived properties ( @xmath10 and @xmath8 ) to keep the binning process closer to the data .",
    "as shown later , in practice , our choice of binning also means that objects with similar values of @xmath10 and @xmath8 are grouped together .",
    "one caveat is that the conversion of h@xmath0  fwhm and @xmath19 into bh masses and @xmath20 can be influenced by several factors such as the dependence of fwhm on our inclination angle to the broad - line region and the choice of bolometric correction for @xmath19 ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "we start by sorting the objects according to their @xmath19 values and then dividing them into 10 groups with an equal number of objects ( 1602 or 1603 ) .",
    "we choose to look at four of these groups with the low ( @xmath21 : @xmath22 erg s@xmath23 ) , intermediate ( @xmath24 : @xmath25 erg s@xmath23 and @xmath26 : @xmath27 erg s@xmath23 ) , and high ( @xmath28 : @xmath29 erg s@xmath23 ) luminosities . specifically , we used groups 1 , 4 , 7 , and 10 and skipped the intermediate ones ( 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 8 , and 9 ) .",
    "this choice gives us the full dynamic range of the sample , while keeping the number of bins to a manageable number .",
    "we do not increase the size of the bins to use all of the spectra in the sample because we are interested in creating high s / n composites of objects that are as similar as possible .",
    "the conversion of @xmath19 and h@xmath0  fwhm into @xmath8 and @xmath10 has significant uncertainties ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , high energy agn spectral energy distributions change as a function of luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and so derived quantities such as bolometric luminosities ( required for @xmath20 ) are likely not properly calibrated for all luminosities @xcite .",
    "we then use the measurements of h@xmath0  from @xcite to separate objects into three groups : narrow , intermediate , and broad h@xmath0  using 2000 and 4000 @xmath6  as our boundaries ( excluding objects with h@xmath0  fwhm @xmath30 20000 @xmath6 ) .",
    "we choose fewer bins in h@xmath0  fwhm compared to @xmath19 because of the considerably smaller dynamic range of the fwhm values , a factor of @xmath31 compared to three orders of magnitude for the sample s range of @xmath19 .",
    "the boundary at 2000  @xmath6  marks the traditional definition of narrow - line seyfert  1s @xcite , and the intermediate bin covers the main peak of the h@xmath0  fwhm distribution .",
    "once the quasars are divided by luminosity and balmer line width , we are interested in looking at the nlr properties of these bins .",
    "specifically , we investigate if there is any evidence for redshift evolution that might be expected if agn host galaxies have evolved since redshift 0.75 .",
    "we thus divide each of these luminosity groups into 7 subsets according to their redshifts with bins of width 0.1 centred at : 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.4 , 0.5 , 0.6 , and 0.7 .",
    "this results in 4 @xmath32 @xmath33 3 h@xmath0  fwhm @xmath33 7 @xmath2 = 84 bins , 8 of which are empty ( primarily the high luminosity / low redshift ones ) as shown in table [ tbl : bins ] .",
    "for the 76 non - empty bins , we make median composite spectra with @xmath34 clipping using iraf s scombine tool .",
    "we choose to create median composites to preserve the ews of the lines ( see @xcite for a good discussion of the difference between median and mean composites ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      compared to the much more prominent [ o  iii ] , the [ o  ii ]  line is fairly weak in the spectra of radio - quiet quasars .",
    "in general , [ o  ii ]  emission may have contributions from photo - ionization from the agn and/or star - formation in the host galaxy .",
    "photoionization models suggest that in a pure agn , the [ o  ii ]  to [ o  iii ]  ratio ranges between 0.1 and 0.3 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "similarly , @xcite find that in quasars , the agn contribution to [ o  ii ]  is more dominant than the host galaxy s .",
    "the [ o  ii ]  luminosities in our composite spectra are shown in top - left panel of figure [ linelums ] .",
    "the figure shows a trend of increasing [ o  ii ]  luminosity with redshift of nearly an order of magnitude .",
    "we calculated a spearman correlation coefficient of @xmath35 for [ o  ii ]  luminosity vs. redshift shown in figure [ linelums ] , with @xmath36 ( @xmath37 being the probability of no correlation ) which indicates the high probability that the two quantities are strongly correlated .",
    "we note however that this correlation can potentially be a result of the missing high luminosity , low - redshift quasar composites in our sample .",
    "however , tracing the data from quasars of similar luminosity , the general trend is towards higher [ o  ii ]  luminosities at higher redshift . to further examine this possibility , we look at the correlation between the line luminosity and redshift for each l@xmath38 bin separately and we find that the correlation is still strong for most cases but the significance of the correlation becomes much lower ( higher @xmath37 value ) as a result of fewer data points in each sub - sample ( l1:@xmath39 , l4 : @xmath40 , l7 : @xmath41 , l10 : @xmath42 ) . in addition to the spearman test , we calculate a least - squares regression slope for each l@xmath38 and h@xmath0  bin ( table [ tbl : linear_reg ] ) and find that in most cases , [ o  ii ]  has a weak but significant trend to increase towards higher redshift .",
    "the [ o  ii ]  luminosity is indeed known to be a reliable tracer of sfr in non - agn and agn galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ", we consider the ratio of the line fluxes of the two oxygen lines .",
    "figure [ oratiovsz ] shows the flux ratio of [ o  ii ]  to [ o  iii ]  in our sample .",
    "the figure shows that almost 50% of the objects ( primarily among the low and intermediate continuum luminosity bins ; @xmath45 erg s@xmath23 ) have [ o  ii]/[o  iii ]  @xmath46 consistent with [ o  ii ]  emission produced in stellar h  ii regions @xcite .",

    "the line ratio distribution shows no evidence for evolution as a function of redshift .",
    "[ oratiovsz ] ]    the apparent increase in [ o  ii ]  line luminosity as a function of redshift could arise from different factors other than an increase in sfr in the typical quasar host galaxy .",
    "for instance , the use of a fixed - size aperture ( the sdss uses a 3  fiber ) means that spectra potentially include a larger fraction of the host galaxy gas at high redshifts than in lower redshift objects due to the larger projected physical size at higher redshifts .",
    "specifically , the projected size is 5.5  kpc at @xmath47 and 22  kpc at @xmath48 .",
    "however , we do not anticipate this to be the main reason for the observed increase in the [ o  ii ]  luminosity ( if due solely to photo - ionization by the quasar ) as the size of the entire nlr is probably less than 10  kpc .",
    "to check , we employ the nlr scaling relation from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their eq .",
    "1 ) : @xmath49 } } -(18.5 \\pm 2.6),\\ ] ] and our measured [ o  iii ]  luminosities ( which are significantly higher than the [ o  ii ]  luminosities ) , we find the size of the nlr in our composites is @xmath50  kpc . if the [ o  ii ]  emission is instead largely from star formation in the host galaxy , then the size of the star - forming region within the galaxy is the relevant factor .",
    "however , the size of the entire galaxy is not expected to exceed @xmath51 kpc , and the star - forming regions may be considerably more compact .",
    "@xcite , for example , found in a sample of galaxies selected from the moircs deep survey with up to redshift 3 , that the half - light radius ( @xmath52 ) in the @xmath53-band is between 510 kpc .",
    "the calculation of sfrs using the [ o  ii ]  line in isolation is , however , not completely straightforward .",
    "the conversion of the observed line luminosity to sfrs is complicated by effects such as reddening and metal abundance .",
    "several attempts have been made to come up with calibrations that allow for a direct estimation of sfrs from line fluxes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these calibrations are useful for estimating sfrs without directly involving assumptions about metallicity and intrinsic extinction that are by and large the major sources of uncertainty .",

    "we plot the results in figure [ sfrvsz ] which shows that the sfr calculated with equation [ eq : sfr ] increases with @xmath2 .",
    "as interpreted at face value , the figure also shows that higher continuum luminosity composites have higher sfrs as expected from the higher [ o  ii ]  luminosities in the higher @xmath19 composites ( see fig .",
    "[ linelums ] ) . the different h@xmath0  fwhm bins overlap in terms of sfrs .",

    "the luminosity of the lowest ionization narrow line,[o  ii ] , appears to increase with redshift ( top - left panel of fig .",

    "because the [ o  ii ]  line is known to be a reliable sfr estimator in non - active galaxies , we interpret this result as evidence for higher sfrs in the host galaxies of agns at higher redshift , we calculate a sfr using the [ o  ii ]  luminosity and the scaling relation of @xcite and find that the estimated sfr is increasing with redshift however with a smaller power - law slope ( @xmath57 ) than found in non - agn galaxies ( 4.5 ; @xcite .",

    "this spectral library consists of 62 quasar spectra generated from a homogeneous set of quasars that share similar continuum luminosity , broad line width , and are at similar redshifts . starting from a sample of @xmath72 quasars , we separate the objects into 4 groups of continuum luminosity ( high , two intermediate , and low ) and further separate each of these luminosity groups into 3 groups depending on their h@xmath0 width ( using 2000 and 4000 @xmath73 as boundaries ) .",

    "<S> in contrast , we find that the [ o  ii ]  line becomes stronger at higher redshifts , and we interpret this as a consequence of enhanced star formation contributing to the [ o  ii ]  emission in host galaxies at higher redshifts . </S>",
