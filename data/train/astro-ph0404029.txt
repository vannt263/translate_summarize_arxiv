    "despite that as much as 75% of the stellar mass in the universe is in early - type galaxies ( e.g. fukugita et al .",
    "1998 ) , the epoch at which these massive galaxies have assembled and acquired their high metallicity is still unknown . although the progenitors of these massive galaxies should be seen at high redshifts , connecting them with their high redshift counterparts remains a difficult task .",
    "the currently best known high-@xmath4 galaxy population is that of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs , steidel et al .",
    "1999 ) . like in local starbursts ,",
    "the strongest features in the rest - frame uv spectrum of lbgs are interstellar and photospheric absorption lines of c , n , o , si , and fe , typical of hot massive stars ( e.g. shapley et al . 2003 , s03 hereafter ) .",
    "they have sub - solar metallicity ( pettini et al .",
    "2001 ) , very young stellar population ( @xmath50.2 gyr ) , low masses ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "moreover , it appears that the spatial clustering of @xmath7 lbgs is too low for them to be direct progenitors of @xmath8 extremely red objects ( eros ) and local massive galaxies ( daddi et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "while these uv - selected lbgs are certainly an important component of the high-@xmath4 galaxy population , it is still not clear how representative of the entire population at high-@xmath4 they are .",
    "there might be other objects at high-@xmath4 that would not be picked up by this selection .",
    "in fact , there are evidences that @xmath1-selected galaxies at @xmath9 are much more strongly clustered than uv - selected ones ( daddi et al",
    "for instance , the @xmath1-selected galaxies which are in the so - called _ redshift desert _ at @xmath10 ( daddi et al .",
    "2004 , d04 hereafter ) appear to be an important class of objects , with overall physical properties quite distinct from those of lbgs . comparing the properties of lbgs at @xmath7 from s03 with the sample investigated in this paper taken from d04 , it appears that @xmath1-band luminous galaxies at @xmath11 have higher reddening ( @xmath120.4 vs @xmath130.17 ) , redder uv slopes ( @xmath14 vs @xmath151.09 ) , higher sfrs ( @xmath16100500 m@xmath17/yr vs @xmath1850 m@xmath17/yr ) , older ages ( @xmath19 myr vs @xmath20300 myr ) and , therefore , higher masses ( @xmath21 vs @xmath22@xmath23 ) .",
    "these differences are likely arising as a consequence of the @xmath1-selection , as opposed to the uv selection for lbgs .",
    "given their observational properties , it has been argued that these @xmath1-luminous galaxies may represent better candidates than lbgs as star forming progenitors of massive early - type galaxies ( d04 ) . if these objects are indeed the progenitors of local early - type galaxies one would expect them to harbor more metal rich stellar populations and interstellar medium , compared to lbgs . in this letter",
    "we revisit these @xmath1-luminous galaxies by analyzing their composite spectrum and comparing it with those of various templates , including lbgs and starburst galaxies , in order to gather new insight on their metal enrichment , on their nature and on their role in galaxy evolution .",
    "the k20 survey obtained vlt spectroscopy of a complete sample of about 500 galaxies with @xmath24 ( cimatti et al .",
    "2002 ) . in this letter",
    ", we focus on the spectral properties of five k20 galaxies in the cdfs goods - south field at @xmath25 , with the highest s / n ratio among the nine presented in d04 . including the even redder k20 galaxies with no spectroscopic redshifts and @xmath26 , the nine objects represent @xmath2730% of @xmath11 @xmath1-selected galaxies .",
    "this may introduce a bias toward the uv brightest objects , possibly minimizing the differences with respect to lbgs .",
    "the average spectrum nevertheless shows significantly different features when compared with lbgs as shown in the following sections .",
    "the individual spectra were reduced to a common resolution of 25   in the observed frame , by convolving them with a top - hat function .",
    "this allowed to match the lowest resolution of some of the spectra taken with grism 150i at @xmath28 with vlt+fors2 .",
    "the spectra were normalized to a common mean flux level within the range @xmath29  , de - redshifted and then coadded to produce a representative average spectrum at @xmath30 .",
    "a flux normalized version of the average spectrum was obtained by fitting the continuum with a _ spline _ function .",
    "the resolution of the composite spectrum is low ( @xmath16 8   in the rest - frame ) , however the strong features seen in their average spectra can give important information on the nature of these objects . in order to evaluate the s / n ratio of the final coadded spectrum we used relatively line - free regions in the continuum normalized spectrum . in three such regions at 1270 - 1287  , 1440 - 1470  , 1876 - 1904   we measure s / n@xmath1630 over the 1   pixel sampling .",
    "as all the spectra were boxcar smoothed to match the 8   resolution of the final average , such estimate may be taken as representative of the s / n ratio over a full 8   resolution element .",
    "the true s / n ratio is likely higher considering that those regions will actually contain faint lines , given that the coadded spectrum is completely filled with absorption lines in the 1200 - 2000   domain investigated here .",
    "the lbg class as a whole has been recently analyzed by s03 using the coadded spectra of almost 1000 low s / n spectra of lbgs at z@xmath31 , divided in 4 subsamples according to the ew of ly@xmath32 . in order to bracket the range of lbgs properties , we show in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] the comparison with the s03 lbgs templates having the lowest ly@xmath32 ew ( i.e. ly@xmath32 in absorption , group 1 in s03 ) and the largest ly@xmath32 ew ( i.e. ly@xmath32 in emission , group 4 in s03 ) .",
    "this latter comparison is perhaps the most appropriate , as none of the @xmath1-luminous galaxies at @xmath2 have ly@xmath32 in emission , and also because the lbgs with no ly@xmath32 emission have the reddest uv slopes ( s03 ) , although not as red as those of the @xmath1-selected galaxies .",
    "the spectrum of both high-@xmath4 galaxy classes is dominated by absorption lines . the ly@xmath32 absorption lbg spectrum and that of the @xmath1-luminous galaxies show a rather good match of the siii  1526 and civ  1550 features .",
    "these are the two strongest features in the lbgs composite spectum .",
    "as noted by s03 , the interstellar rather than the wind component dominates the si  iv doublet at 1400   in the lbgs , while the c  iv feature exhibits both the blueshifted broad absorption and redshifted emission associated with the stellar winds , in addition to a strong , narrower , interstellar absorption component .",
    "the lack of resolution in our composite spectrum smooths out the wind signatures , however , at the same resolution , the overall shape of the civ feature is similar in both spectra , whereas the siiv interstellar line is stronger in the @xmath1-luminous galaxies .",
    "other interstellar lines such as cii  1335 and alii  1671 are also appreciably stronger in the @xmath1-luminous galaxies than in lbgs .",
    "all absorption features are much weaker in the the other lbgs composites having stronger ly@xmath32 emission ( fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , bottom panel ) than in the @xmath1-luminous galaxies .",
    "the most striking differences between the lbg composite spectra and the @xmath1-luminous composite are the absorption lines at @xmath161295  , @xmath161380  , @xmath161430  , @xmath161485   which are remarkably strong in the latter and almost undetected or very weak in the former .",
    "we have identified these features as the photospheric absorptions of siiii  1296 , ciii  1428 , and siii  1485 ( de mello et al .",
    "close to these lines there are also photospheric lines of feii , fev and niv ] which could be blended with them due to the low resolution .",
    "the @xmath161380   feature is probably a blend of several fe photospheric lines in the region 13601390   ( leitherer et al .",
    "in addition , the weak feature seen on the red side of siii  1526 is likely due to the photospheric lines siii and feiv at @xmath161533  , while red broad edge of siii  1304 seems to be due to the presence of the photospheric siii  1309 .",
    "we interpret the strong photospheric lines in our spectrum as a clear indication of a significantly higher metallicity in the stellar component of the @xmath1-luminous galaxies at @xmath2 compared to the lbgs at @xmath3 which have sub - solar metallicity .",
    "besides to a higher metallicity , the stronger interstellar lines can also be due to a higher interstellar velocity dispersion caused by large - scale inhomogeneities and macroscopic motions in the interstellar medium , as noted in other high-@xmath4 galaxies such as ms1512-cb58 ( e.g. de mello et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the detection of several strong stellar lines in the average spectrum of @xmath1-luminous galaxies at @xmath11 unambiguously indicates high metallicity in these galaxies , to an extent that has no counterpart among other known high redshift galaxies .",
    "therefore , we have checked whether a similar spectrum is exhibited by any of the most well studied local starbursts galaxies .",
    "we found that the local starbursts , ngc  1705 - 1 , ngc  1741 , ngc  4214 , have very different spectral features than those of our @xmath1-selected ones .",
    "a good match is only obtained with the spectrum of ngc  6090 , both for the absorption lines as well as for the continuum ( fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) . note in particular",
    "that ngc  6090 has an almost identical strength of the @xmath33  , @xmath34   and @xmath35    absorption systems and a marginally weaker @xmath36   absorption .",
    "these are the undetected or very weak lines in lbgs , which were identified as photospheric lines in the previous section .",
    "the interstellar lines of ngc  6090 appear on average systematically blueshifted by 12   with respect to those of the @xmath1-luminous galaxies , unlike the stellar ones , suggesting a weaker effect of winds .",
    "this difference is not apparent toward lbgs .",
    "although no strong conclusion can be derived from a single object , this match is intriguing because the overall properties of ngc  6090 are similar to the @xmath1-selected galaxies ( see d04 ) .",
    "ngc  6090 is a well known interacting system which is in the process of merging .",
    "it is a luminous infrared galaxy ( lirg ) with log @xmath37 ( scoville et al .",
    "2000 ) pointing to the presence of a strong burst of star - formation .",
    "it has a large number of luminous clusters triggered by the galaxy - galaxy interaction .",
    "the other local starbursts , on the other hand , are dwarf galaxies having likely their first major burst of star - formation . for instance , ngc  1705 - 1 is a super - star - cluster ( sscs ) in a dwarf galaxy which experienced a strong burst of star - formation @xmath1610 myr ago ( de mello et al .",
    "2000 ) ; ngc  1741 is an interacting system with sscs of a few myr to @xmath16 100 myr , and masses between 10@xmath38 and 10@xmath39 m@xmath40 ( johnson et al .",
    "1999 ) ; ngc  4214 is a magellanic irregular with sscs of ages 1 - 3 myr old ( maiz - apellaniz et al .",
    "1998 ) . like ngc  6090",
    "the @xmath1-luminous galaxies are massive galaxies with spatially extended starbursts .",
    "we have also checked whether the composite spectrum of the @xmath1-luminous galaxies can be reproduced by the starburst99 stellar evolutionary synthesis models ( leitherer et al .",
    "1999 ; hereafter sb99 ) .",
    "we first investigated the contraints given by the strength of the civ  1550 absorption system . in the models with instantaneous star formation",
    "this feature rapidly disappears after the cessation of star formation ( see fig .  5 in de mello et al . 2000 ) .",
    "therefore , its detection in the composite spectrum of the @xmath2 galaxies demonstrates that they contain a population of young stars .",
    "this supports the notion that the red slopes of the uv spectra of the k20 star - forming galaxies at @xmath2 are due to reddening and not to ageing of their stellar populations , confirming that these galaxies are active starbursts and thus relevant contributors to the star formation density at @xmath11 , as discussed in d04 . at the same time",
    ", we do not detect the strong p - cygni shape of civ  1550 , typical of massive , short - lived o stars . as a consequence ,",
    "a single burst which occurred within @xmath41 myr can be ruled out .",
    "instead , models with continuous star formation reproduce well the strength of civ  1550 at pratically any older age .    secondly , we used sb99 to obtain constraints on the overall metallicity of the @xmath1-luminous galaxies .",
    "we used the equivalent width of the absorption features in the wavelength range 1415 - 1435   as a  metallicity index \" which does not strongly depend on age and imf ( leitherer et al .",
    "[ f3 ] shows a zoom of this region , which covers the photospheric features siiii  1417 , ciii  1427 and fev  1430 . as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] , the three lines are detected , but due to the low resolution ciii and fev are blended .",
    "we attempted to deblend the two lines by fitting the feature with two gaussian profiles and found that the central wavelengths of two gaussians do coincide with the ciii and fev wavelengths .",
    "we measured the equivalent width of the index to be ew@xmath42  .",
    "the same absorption system in the sb99 models has ew=0.5   and ew=1.2    for metallicities 0.25z@xmath40 and z@xmath40 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the @xmath1-luminous galaxies have metallicity index higher than the sb99 0.25z@xmath40 metallicity at the 4 - 5@xmath43 level and higher than the sb99 z@xmath40 metallicity at the @xmath163@xmath43 level . the 0.4   error we derive for the metallicity index may be slightly underestimated because of mismatches in the continuum normalization . however , the observed ew of the 1415 - 1435   feature would be even higher if considering also the wings of the lines that , because of the low resolution , expand outside the 1415 - 1435   region ( ew=2.8   in the region 1412 - 1440 ) .",
    "recently , steidel et al . (",
    "2004 ) also used the 1425   index and sb99 to estimate the metallicity of uv selected galaxies at 1.4@xmath5z@xmath52.5 and found that they have metallicity near solar .",
    "the fact that our sources have even stronger absorptions in this range suggests that their metallicity is generally higher than that of steidel et al .",
    "uv - selected galaxies at @xmath2 .",
    "this is quite plausible given that the @xmath1-selected galaxies are likely to be on average more massive than the uv - selected ones .",
    "note , however , that the two classes of objects are not entirely distinct , as @xmath449% of the uv - selected galaxies at @xmath11 are brighter than @xmath45 ( steidel et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "finally , we emphasize that besides the 1425   index , other evidences exist that point towards a high metallicity . as we showed before , there are several photospheric and interstellar lines that are much stronger in the composite spectrum than in the z@xmath17 sb99 models and than in the lbgs composite spectrum suggesting that @xmath1-luminous galaxies have high metallicity . similarly to savaglio et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , strong fe  ii and mn  ii lines are detected in the near - uv ( 2200 - 2700  ) region ( not shown here ) , consistently with high metallicity .",
    "the most striking feature of the near - uv spectrum of @xmath1-band luminous galaxies at @xmath2 is the presence of strong stellar absorption features , with strengths not previously reported at high redshifts that suggest a high metallicity for this class of high-@xmath4 galaxies .",
    "stellar photospheric lines are important diagnostic of the stellar content of galaxies and their detection also demonstrate an uv continuum without a dominant agn contribution .",
    "these stellar features are typical of b - type stars ( de mello et al .",
    "2000 ) , which are dominating the uv flux in the explored spectral region , rather than short - lived very massive o stars .",
    "this can be well expected given that the strong balmer breaks detected in the near - ir imply high mass contents and continuous sfr for @xmath46 myr ( see d04 ) .",
    "the fact that our composite spectrum was generated with a small number of galaxies may affect these results , as a few peculiar objects could be present .",
    "coaddition of a larger number of spectra is desirable for the future in order to smooth out the contribution of individual objects .",
    "as these @xmath1-selected starbursts are found to have redder uv slopes and higher reddening than uv - selected galaxies at @xmath47 ( the uv selection requires blue and flat slopes ) , it seems reasonable to find that they have also a higher metal content .",
    "it is not clear whether these galaxies are evolutionary descendants of @xmath48 lbgs .",
    "the higher metallicity and dust content could be a consequence of the continuous star formation which occurred between the two epochs .",
    "however , if the d04 tentative estimate of a correlation length of @xmath49 1 mpc for the @xmath1-selected galaxies at @xmath2 is confirmed , they seem to be more clustered than the lbgs at z@xmath50 .",
    "this suggests a different evolutionary path for the two populations .",
    "sawicki & yee ( 1998 ) suggested that lbgs are either the progenitors of present - day sub - l * galaxies , or may form luminous galaxies through mergers as they evolve .",
    "however , one would expect a stronger clustering in the latter case ( daddi et al .",
    "2001 ) .    the signatures of their high metallicity , the confirmation of very high sfrs , together with the evidences for high masses and possibly strong clustering reinforce the suggestion that these @xmath1-luminous objects at @xmath2 well qualify as progenitors of local early - type galaxies , caught while still in the act of actively forming stars .",
    "indeed , with their masses being estimated above 10@xmath51m@xmath17 they would most likely become early - type galaxies at @xmath52 .",
