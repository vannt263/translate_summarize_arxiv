    "<S> _ ab initio _ quantum chemistry calculations for systems with large active spaces are notoriously difficult and can not be successfully tackled by standard methods . in this letter , we generalize a green s function qm / qm embedding method called self - energy embedding theory ( seet ) that has the potential to be successfully employed to treat large active spaces . in generalized seet , active orbitals are grouped into intersecting groups of few orbitals allowing us to perform multiple parallel calculations yielding results comparable to the full active space treatment . </S>",

    "<S> methods such as complete active space self - consistent field ( casscf ) @xcite or complete active space second - order perturbation theory ( caspt2)@xcite can treat easily strongly correlated molecules with up to 16 electrons in 16 strongly correlated orbitals but when generalized to solids the strongly correlated orbitals from every cell add up to a huge overall number making such calculations impossible . however , due to the experimental progress in solid state chemistry , more than ever the development of a general method capable of treating both strongly correlated molecules and solids while remaining computationally affordable and quantitatively accurate is desired .    </S>",
    "<S> the qm / qm embedding methods such as dynamical mean field theory ( dmft )  @xcite , density matrix embedding theory ( dmet )  @xcite , and self - energy embedding theory ( seet )  @xcite offer a viable route of generalizing its molecular versions to solids . however , to yield accurate results , molecular versions of these methods must be extensively tested and all the possible sources of inaccuracies must be removed or estimated to deliver systematically improvable and highly accurate answers .    in this letter , we focus on generalizing the functional form of seet to successfully overcome the drawbacks of its original formulation . </S>",

    "<S> thus , in the original formulation of seet only the self - energy elements within each strongly correlated group are treated with an accurate method . </S>",

    "<S> ultimately such a description may lead to an accuracy loss since only a small part of the self - energy matrix is recovered at an accurate , costly , and non - perturbative level .    </S>",
    "<S> [ htb ]   and @xmath17 are groups of strongly correlated orbitals.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in the generalized formulation of seet , we overcome this difficulty by producing the self - energy matrix where all the elements between all strongly correlated orbitals ( the ones within the groups and between the groups ) are described at the expensive and accurate level , thus creating a better approximation to the exact self - energy , for schematics see fig .  </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : interactions ] . this is achieved by grouping strongly correlated orbitals ( or any orbitals ) into the intersecting groups . </S>",
    "<S> since such a seet formulation leads to the double counting of electron correlation coming from the intersecting orbital groups a procedure to subtract out these double counting contributions must be carried out . </S>",

    "<S> note , that all the intersecting groups of strongly correlated orbitals @xmath26 @xmath27 can be treated simultaneously using parallel computing . </S>",
    "<S> while theoretically it is necessary to include all the contributions to the functional and evaluate @xmath28,@xmath29,@xmath30,n impurity problems necessary to obtain the self - energy , in practice certain groups can be easily excluded . for molecules ( or any system with a sizable gap ) , it is not necessary to create groups of exclusively occupied or virtual orbitals since the self - energy obtained from these groups is close to zero . </S>",
    "<S> our observations indicate that one can further restrict the number of possible orbital groups severely and get very good results if one includes equal number of bonding and anti - bonding orbitals in each of the orbital groups . </S>",
    "<S> another possibility of restricting the number of intersecting groups is to use localized orbitals since only the overlapping orbitals should be within one group . note that the selection of orbital groups can be done either in the natural or molecular orbital basis or based on spatial distribution of the orbitals in a local orbital basis .    </S>",

    "<S> the selection of the strongly correlated orbitals can be done based on the partial occupations of the 1-body density matrix produced in gf2  @xcite or gw . in hf , the shape of molecular orbitals and the chemical intuition can be used to guide the selection . subsequently , based on the computational cost of the accurate solver capable of treating aims in the embedding construction , we choose the number of strongly correlated orbitals @xmath23 that is assigned to each group . in our work , the full configuration interaction ( fci ) or its truncated variants  @xcite are used as solvers for aims . since the strongly correlated orbital groups are intersecting ( multiple groups may contain the same orbital ) , we need to ensure that the resulting elements of self - energy are not included multiple times and double counted . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , aims with impurity orbitals belonging to the intersects are constructed and resulting self - energies are subtracted out from the total sum of self - energies coming from multiple impurities  . for a general case this is illustrated at the functional level in eq .  </S>",

    "<S> where @xmath7o stands for the number of orbitals in each orbital group treated with accurate method ; these orbital groups are intersecting .    since different number of orbitals can be used to form groups of intersecting orbitals , we can create a series of approximations to the accurate seet(method@xmath31/method@xmath32)-mix(@xmath9o ) which would include all @xmath9 strongly correlated orbitals in the subset treated by a high level , accurate method . </S>",

    "<S> in contrast to recovering only a subset of self - energy elements in seet - split version , seet - mix(@xmath7o ) always leads to recovering all the self - energy elements between @xmath9 strongly correlated orbitals with the accurate treatment of self - energy between @xmath36 orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> such a treatment provides a smooth convergence of the energies to the seet - mix(@xmath9o ) answer .    to demonstrate the potential of the generalized seet , first we consider a simple h@xmath37 chain and 2@xmath384 h lattice . </S>",

    "<S> the mix[2o ] scheme , however , is still insufficient to recover the full[6o ] energy in the stretched regime . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore enlarge the active space by introducing the mix[4o ] scheme . while there are some possibilities to construct the active spaces of 4o from 6o using the mixing scheme , here we employ the most straightforward way where we simply mix the bonding  anti - bonding pairs which were used in the split[3@xmath382o ] scheme ( for details see fig .  </S>",

    "<S> , we use fci energy as a reference . </S>",
    "<S> the split[2@xmath384o ] calculation in nos improves over gf2 but it is far from fci due to the lack of correlations between strongly correlated orbital groups . </S>",
