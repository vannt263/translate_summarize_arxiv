    "it is well known nowadays that our current universe is experiencing an accelerated expansion @xcite-@xcite .",
    "there are two general ways to explain this accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the first way is considering that the universe is essentially filled by an exotic fluid with negative pressure , responsible of it acceleration , called the dark energy .",
    "the second way is modifying the gravitational action from the general relativity ( gr ) without the need of the dark energy , firstly considered by 1970 @xcite .",
    "buchdahl has generalized the einstein equations by substituting the ricci s scalar @xmath2 by an arbitrary function of @xmath2 , named @xmath7 theory of gravity .",
    "another theories , view as alternative to the gr , also have been undertaken , still in the way to better explain the obscure content of the universe , as , @xmath8@xcite-@xcite , @xmath1@xcite-@xcite and @xmath9@xcite-@xcite , where @xmath10 , @xmath3 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the invariant of gauss - bonnet , the trace of energy - momentum tensor , the ricci s tensor and the energy - momentum tensor corresponding to the ordinary content of the universe .    in this paper",
    ", we focus our attention on @xmath1 theory of gravity . this theory has been considered first by harko and collaborators @xcite .",
    "another authors also have considered this present theory and important results have been found @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , any one of the works developed in these papers does not solve the coincidence problem , that is , how does the universe transits from the decelerated phase to the current accelerated phase ?",
    "the universe is accelerated for the low values of the redshift and the one that splits the two phases ( transition redshift ) , denoted @xmath13 , those the current value is @xmath14 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 theory can successfully predict the transition from the matter dominated phase to the current accelerated one and several works have described this transition @xcite .",
    "the reconstruction of @xmath1 models describing the matter dominated and accelerated phases had been performed in @xcite .",
    "various works also have been performed , still in the optic to better explore this transition with interesting results ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .    in this paper , we focus our attention on the epoch after the recombination where , beside the well known ordinary matter ( the dust ) , there is the self - interacting matter , called collisional matter .",
    "the model of collisional matter has been studied in some works within others theories of gravity , leading to interesting results @xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this approach of considering new form of matter , instead of the cold dark matter can edify us on the choice of the models of modified gravity .",
    "oikonomou and collaborators @xcite have studied the time evolution of the cosmological parameters during the late time acceleration of the universe with the presence of the collisional matter in the framework of modified @xmath7 gravity . in this paper , we have extended the same idea to the @xmath1 .",
    "some @xmath1 models have been considered and the behaviours of the cosmological parameters have been performed and compared with the @xmath5cdm model .",
    "we see within many results that depending on the input parameters according to the model under consideration , the inclusion of collisional matter may lead to a better explanation of the phase transition , comparatively to the model where just the usual ordinary matter is considered .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec2 ] we describe the general formalism of @xmath1 theory of gravity . the collisional matter that self - interacts is presented in the section [ sec3 ] .",
    "the section [ sec4 ] is devoted to the study of time evolution of the cosmological parameters where the universe is considered to be filled by the usual ordinary matter and the collisional one . here , for the study of these cosmological parameters , we focus our attention on the transition from the decelerated phase to the accelerated one . in the section [ sec5 ]",
    "we examine the evolution of the equation of state of the dark energy where the matter content is assumed as a fluid is composed by the collisional matter and the radiation . the conclusion and perspectives",
    "are presented in the section [ sec6 ] .",
    "in this section we present the generality of @xmath1 theory by substituting the curvature scalar @xmath2 of the gr by a function of @xmath2 and the trace @xmath3 , and writing the action as @xcite @xmath15\\,\\ , , \\label{1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 , @xmath3 denote the curvature scalar and the trace of the energy - momentum tensor , respectively , and @xmath16 , @xmath17 being the gravitation constant .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor associated to the matter is defined by @xmath18 let us assume that the matter lagrangian density @xmath19 only depends on the components of the metric tensor , but not on its derivatives .",
    "thereby , one gets @xmath20 within the metric formalism , varying the action @xmath21 with respect to the metric , one obtains the following field equations @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 are the partial derivatives of @xmath24 with respect to @xmath25and @xmath26 respectively .",
    "the tensor @xmath27 is determined by @xmath28 as mentioned in our introduction , we assume that the whole content of the universe is a perfect fluid",
    ". then , by setting the matter lagrangian density to @xmath29 , the energy - momentum tensor may take the following expression ( see appendix ) @xmath30 where the four - velocity satisfies the relations @xmath31 and @xmath32 = 0 .",
    "* note that the expression ( [ 6 ] ) is obtained with the consideration according to what the pressure does not depend on the metric tensor . within this consideration according to what the lagrangian density does not depend of the metric tensor , the contribution of the last term of @xmath33 vanishes and this equation takes the following form ( see also eq . ( 21 ) of @xcite ) @xmath34 however , in the case of the electromagnetic field or scalar field , there is actively contribution of the last term of ( [ 5 ] ) because in these cases the respective lagrangian densities @xmath35 and @xmath36 , explicitly depend on the metric .",

    "this king of matter has been introduced firstly in @xcite in the framework of gr and @xmath7 .",
    "the evolution of the collisional matter depends on the source that drives the whole content ( matter and energy ) of the univers .",
    "the study of the model of collisional matter with perfect fluid has been performed widely in @xcite . in this work , we recall that our basic assumption is that the matter has a total mass - energy density , denoted by @xmath49 , which is assumed to be depending on two contributions as @xmath50 here , @xmath51 refers to the part that does not change due to the fact of characterising the usual matter content @xcite,@xcite .",
    "concerning the term @xmath52 , it expresses the energy density part of the energy momentum tensor associated with thermodynamical content of the collisional matter .",
    "this fluid could not be dust , but possesses a positive pressure and satisfying the following equation of state @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes the parameter of equation of state of the collisional matter whose values is such that @xmath55 .",
    "the potential energy density is assumed to have the form @xcite,@xcite , @xmath56 where the constants @xmath57 and @xmath58 are their current values .",
    "accordingly , after elementary transformation the total - energy density of the universe can be written as @xmath59 through the continuity equation , the motions of the volume elements in the interior of a continuous medium can be traduced @xmath60 and the energy - momentum tensor takes the following form @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the four velocity , satisfying the relation @xmath63 .",
    "we note here that @xmath64 because the pressure of ordinary matter is negligible . making use of the frw line element ( [ 10 ] ) , the conservation law of the equation ( [ 15 ] ) @xmath65 which , upon consideration of the equations ( [ 12 ] ) and ( [ 14 ] ) , leads to @xcite @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the current scale factor .",
    "we can describe the collisional matter by equations ( [ 14 ] ) and ( [ 18 ] ) and use therm in the rest of the manuscript in the next section .",
    "the value of @xmath58 is equal to @xcite @xmath68 we will use the same value @xcite,@xcite of @xmath69 for making the numerical study . according to the fact that @xmath70 , and making use of eq .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) , one gets @xmath71 , meaning that this latter is the current value of the potential energy per unit rest - mass , associated with the infinitesimal deformations ( expansions or / and compressions ) of the fluid ( see detail in @xcite ) .",
    "in this subsection we examine the deceleration parameter @xmath0 in @xmath1 considering a that the universe , beside the ordinary matter and dark energy , also is filled with collisional matter at late time cosmological evolution . in this optic , we rewritte the field equation ( [ 4 ] ) in the following form @xmath72 , \\label{19 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath73 , \\label{20}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have assumed @xmath74 . the parameter @xmath75 denotes the hubble parameter , the  dot \" , the time derivative of @xmath76 .",

    "the numerical analysis also will be performed in order to find the hubble parameter . in a first step , by using the expression @xmath103 we can perform the study of the deceleration parameter with the account of the collisional matter , this latter assumed as a function of the redshift @xmath104 . in this rubric",
    "we will focus our attention on the transition from the decelerated phase to the accelerated one .",
    "therefore , we will compare the results with the case where the non - collisional matter ( pressure - less ) is considered , and also compare with the @xmath105 case .",
    "we recall that in @xcite , the corresponding deceleration parameter of the expansion in the flat friedmann cosmology for the @xmath105 model is given by @xmath106 { \\bigg [ \\omega_{m0}{(1+z)}^{3}+l_0 \\bigg]}^{-1 } , \\label{33.1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath107 and @xmath108 @xcite .",

    "we discuss two @xmath7 models , performed in @xcite for describing the late time cosmological evolution of our universe under the consideration that it is filled with collisional ( self - interacting ) matter .",
    "thereby , we solve numerically the differential equation about @xmath4 .    the task here is to find the models that should be in agreement with the observational data , namely the deceleration parameter @xmath0 and the parameter of effective equation of state @xmath6 .",
    "the first model considered is a modified power - law model of the curvature scalar @xmath111 where @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 are positive constants .",

    "these features prove that the fact of considering the coexistence of the collisional matter and radiation do not change the well know behaviour the different parameters , and confirm that such consideration may be made .",
    "in this paper we undertake the @xmath1 theory of gravity .",
    "we focus our attention on the cosmological evolution of the parameter of deceleration @xmath0 and also the parameter @xmath6 of the effective equation of state .",
    "the spacial aspect in this paper is that , besides the usual ordinary and the dark energy , new matter is assumed to participate to the matter contribution of the universe .",
    "this matter is self - interacting and called collisional matter , but with positive pressure .",
    "what we now generally is that the ordinary matter interacts with the dark energy , but any of them does self interacts . from the cosmological considerations , its quite reasonable to introduce such a matter , i.e , a collisional , and search for its effects on the cosmological evolution of the universe .    to this end , we considered two @xmath1 models as a sum of two gravitational models @xmath128 and @xmath129 , respectively two functions depending the curvature scalar @xmath2 and the trace @xmath3 of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the general form of the @xmath1 models is constrained to the conservation of the energy leading to the form ( [ 000 ] ) .",
    "the task has been to choose a suitable expression for the function @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , we considered , first , a generalized power - law in @xmath2 , and the second expression is an exponential form in @xmath2 .",
    "we plot the evolutions of @xmath0 and @xmath6 for both the collisional matter , non - collisional matter and the @xmath5cdm and compare them .",
    "our results show that , depending on the type of the model under consideration , the curve characteristic of the collisional matter approaches the @xmath5cdm one that the curve that describes the evolution of the dust . in the same way",
    ", the curve representative of @xmath6 shows that its values are consistent with the observational , confirm the importance of considering the collisional matter in the study of the evolution of our universe .",
    "moreover , we point out other type of matter , the so - called cardassian self - interacting matter , possessing a negative pressure and its corresponding parameter of equation of state has to be different from @xmath130 .",
    "this means that if such a matter is included in the content of the universe , there does not have vacuum energy . in this case , the same analysis have been done , as in the case of collisional matter , comparing the curves representative of this later to those of the dust and also the @xmath5cdm .",
    "our results show that , for both the first and the second @xmath1 models , there is quite reasonable to consider the existence of the cardassian matter since the curve characteristic of this latter approached more the @xmath5cdm that the dust for some values of the redshift , confirming also that this kind of matter may be considered as a component of the universe , because also in this , the parameter @xmath6 takes values strongly consistent with the observational data .    *",
