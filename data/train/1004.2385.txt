    "there are several well - studied relatives of the discrete alloy - type model :    the continuum alloy - type model @xmath12 on @xmath13 where @xmath14 has the same form as in .    the anderson model on @xmath1 : this is the special case of the discrete alloy - type model where @xmath15 .",

    "however , previous results on ( iii)-type models require certain regularity conditions which are typically not satisfied for alloy - type potentials , cf . section [ sec : example ] .",
    "the main challenge of models of the type is that @xmath10 may change its sign which leads to negative correlations of the potential .",
    "this results in a non - monotone dependence on the random variables of certain spectral quantities . for this reason many established tools for the spectral analysis of random schrdinger operators are not directly applicable in this model .    for literature concerning the discussion in this section we refer to the references of @xcite .",
