    "high - mass stars , also called ob stars , have luminosities larger than @xmath0 , spectral types b3 or earlier , and stellar masses roughly spanning the range @xmath1 . from their birth to their death , high - mass stars are known to play a major role in the energy budget of galaxies via their radiation , their wind , and the supernovae . despite that",
    ", the formation of high - mass stars remains an enigmatic process , far less understood than that of their low - mass ( solar - type ) counterparts .",
    "theoretically , the copious uv flux emitted by a stellar embryo of more than @xmath2 heats and ionizes its parental molecular cloud , leading to the formation and development of a hot core and an h region .",
    "these physical and chemical feedback processes are difficult to treat but must be added in analytical and numerical simulations classically used for low - mass star formation .",
    "these further difficulties , summing up with those associated with the star formation process itself ( see chapter on low - mass star formation ) , have long delayed any effort in this direction .",
    "observationally , the main difficulty arises from the fact that high - mass stars are fewer in number than low - mass stars ( see the shape of the imf in , e.g. , fig .  2 of the chapter on low - mass star formation ) .",
    "therefore , molecular clouds able to form high - mass stars are statistically more remote ( typically at @xmath3  kpc ) than those of well - studied low - mass star - forming regions .",
    "current observational studies of high - mass star formation therefore suffers from a lack of spatial resolution and from our bare knowledge of remote star - forming regions .",
    "the past ten years have seen an increasing interest in approaching the issue of the formation of high - mass stars , from both the theoretical and observational sides . here",
    "we review the recent progress made in this domain , and especially in the context of _ herschel _ programmes .",
    "one of the main differences between the formation of high - mass and low - mass stars is that the radiation field of a massive protostar plays a more important role .",
    "indeed , the massive stellar embryo strongly heats the gas and even prevents further matter accretion through its radiation pressure . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", this implies that the radiative transfer must be treated in parallel to the hydrodynamics .",
    "this represents a severe complication mainly responsible for the limited numbers of theoretical studies of this process .",
    "here is presented a short introduction to the theory of high - mass star formation .",
    "the reader interested in this topic will find more complete reviews in zinnecker & yorke ( @xcite ) and beuther et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . in",
    "the following we exclusively focus on studies specific to the formation of massive stars , keeping in mind that most of them are modified versions of theories developed for the formation of low - mass stars ( see , e.g. , the chapter on low - mass star formation ) .",
    "we first describe the basic principles used to estimate the largest stellar mass that one expects to form in the presence of radiative forces .",
    "we then present the various numerical simulations and alternative scenarios which have been performed and proposed to explain the formation of high - mass stars .",
    "the first estimates of the largest stellar mass that can possibly be assembled are due to larson & starrfield ( @xcite ) and kahn ( @xcite ) .",
    "the principle of their analysis is to compare the radiative pressure of a massive stellar embryo to the ram pressure induced by the gravitational collapse of its surrounding massive cloud , in its inner and outer parts .",
    "if the luminosity of the central star becomes high enough , the radiation pressure may become important and prevent further accretion onto the central object . since the radiation pressure is acting on the dust grains",
    ", one has to assume that the frictional coupling between the gas and the dust is sufficiently strong so that forces acting on the dust grains are transmitted to the gas .    in the inner part of the collapsing cloud ,",
    "the temperature becomes high and the dust grains evaporate .",
    "there is thus a dust shell whose inner edge is located at the radius , @xmath4 , where the grains evaporate . at this radius ,",
    "the radiation pressure is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the stellar luminosity and @xmath7 the speed of light .",
    "the dynamical pressure is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the density and @xmath10 the infall speed which is given by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the gravitational constant and @xmath13 the mass of the protostar .",
    "this leads to the ratio of radiative to ram pressures : @xmath14 using an analytic estimate for the temperature inside the cloud and based on the assumption that the grains evaporate at a temperature of @xmath151500  k , larson & starrfield ( @xcite ) estimate the radius of the shell to be : @xmath16 it follows from eqs .  2.12.2 that @xmath17 for a stellar mass of @xmath18 , corresponding to a luminosity of about @xmath19 , @xmath20 roughly equals unity . therefore , according to larson & starrfield ( @xcite ) , the mass at which radiative pressure impedes accretion is around @xmath18 .",
    "in the outer part of the collapsing cloud , the radiative pressure becomes equal to @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the opacity due to dust grains and averaged over the stellar spectrum .",
    "the estimate done by larson & starrfield ( @xcite ) is uncertain since the above expression entails the dust opacity and since the grains properties were poorly known by the time of their study .",
    "a more accurate estimate has been done by wolfire & cassinelli ( @xcite ) by using the optical properties and composition of the mixture of dust grains proposed by mathis et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . assuming an accretion rate of @xmath23yr@xmath24 in a @xmath25 cloud , wolfire & cassinelli",
    "show that @xmath20 is larger than one for any reasonable value of the radiation temperature .",
    "they conclude that building a massive star with the `` standard '' dust grain mixture ( cf .",
    "mathis et al .",
    "@xcite ) is difficult and requires reducing the grain abundance by large factors ( @xmath1548 ) .",
    "they thus propose , as a solution to the high - mass star formation problem , that the dust abundance could be locally decreased by an external shock or an internal ionization front .",
    "more recently , multidimensional numerical simulations have been performed , treating the radiation and the dynamics self - consistently . in these studies",
    ", it has been assumed that the radiation arises from both the accretion and the stellar luminosity . while the former is dominant during the earliest phase of the collapse , the latter rapidly becomes more important .",
    "since computing the radiative transfer is in general a difficult problem , these calculations have made the diffusion approximation ( e.g. mihalas & mihalas @xcite ) .",
    "we will see below that the frequency dependence of the dust opacity which was neglected in sect .",
    "2.2 is an important issue .",
    "one of the main motivations of these calculations is to determine whether the presence of a centrifugally supported optically thick disk , inside which the radiative pressure would be much reduced , may allow to circumvent the radiation pressure problem .",
    "bidimensional axisymmetric numerical simulations have been performed by yorke & sonnhalter ( @xcite ) in the frequency dependent case ( using 64 intervals of frequency ) and in the gray case ( one single interval of frequency ) .",
    "the cloud they consider is centrally peaked , has a thermal over gravitational energy ratio of about 5@xmath26 initially , and is slowly rotating .",
    "they have explored 3 different cases corresponding to 30 , 60 , and @xmath27 cores .",
    "the fiducial run corresponds to a @xmath28 core treated in the frequency - dependent case .",
    "after @xmath1510@xmath29  yr , the central core has a mass of about @xmath30 and the surrounding cloud remains nearly spherical .",
    "after @xmath152@xmath31  yr , the mass of the central core is about @xmath32 and the cloud starts to depart from the spherical symmetry .",
    "in particular , the infall is reversed by radiative forces in the polar region while the star continues to accrete material through the equator where the opacity is much higher . this effect which has first been proposed by nakano et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and jijina & adams ( @xcite ) is known as the `` flashlight effect '' .",
    "once the stellar mass has grown to about @xmath33 , the central star is no longer accreting although @xmath34 of gas is still available within the computational grid .",
    "the infall is then reversed in every directions indicating that the radiative forces are effectively preventing further accretion .",
    "if instead of a multi - frequency treatment , the gray approximation is made , the early evolution is similar but becomes notably different after @xmath152.5@xmath31  yr . in particular , there is no evidence of any flow reversal .",
    "instead the material flows along a thin disklike structure , supported in the radial direction by both centrifugal and radiative forces . at the end of the simulation , the mass of the central star is about @xmath35 .",
    "when the mass of the cloud is initially @xmath34 , all the mass of the cloud is finally accreted onto the central star . for a cloud mass of @xmath27 , as soon as a stellar mass of @xmath36 has been accreted , reversed flows develop in the polar direction but the central object continues to accrete an additional @xmath37 via an equatorial flow through a disklike structure .",
    "very recently , tridimensional calculations have been performed by krumholz et al .",
    "( @xcite ) using the gray approximation for the radiative transfer .",
    "their initial conditions ( aimed at reproducing the model of mckee & tan ( @xcite ) consist in a centrally peaked @xmath25 cloud with a density profile proportional to @xmath38 .",
    "the initial turbulence within the cloud is sufficient to ensure an approximate hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "turbulent motions first delay the onset of collapse but , as the turbulence decays , the cloud starts to collapse .",
    "comparison is made with runs for which a barotropic equation of state ( eos ) is used ( an isothermal eos for most of the gas but an adiabatic eos at high densities ) .",
    "in particular , krumholz et al .",
    "( @xcite ) find that , when the radiative transfer is taken into account , the gas temperature inside the cloud is higher than in the barotropic case , by factors up to 10 , which are depending on the cloud density .",
    "moreover , while the morphology of the flows in the radiative and barotropic cases are similar on large scales , they are significantly different on small scales . because of the lack of thermal support ,",
    "the gas in the isothermal run is much more filamentary , disks are flatter , filaments have smaller radii , and shock structures are thinner . as a consequence , the cloud is fragmenting much less when radiation is taken into account than when a barotropic equation of state is used . in the radiative transfer case ,",
    "only a few condensations are indeed able to survive , the others being sheared apart in the protostellar disk .",
    "the above - mentioned calculations have been performed in the context of a monolithic collapse , that is to say considering the collapse of a single , initially centrally - peaked cloud . in the alternative scenario of competitive accretion",
    ", several stellar embryos are building up their mass within a common cloud also called protocluster ( bonnell et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the accretion of the protostars depends on their location : it is strong at the cloud center where the gas density is high while it is weak near the cloud edge where less gas is available .",
    "the accretion also depends on the mass of the stars since the most massive stars are able to attract more gas and therefore increase further their accretion domain .",
    "the specificity of the competitive accretion compared to a monolithic collapse is that the gas is not assumed to be gathered before the star formation begins .",
    "in fact , competitive accretion provides the main physical mechanism to gather the matter . in the scenario of the competitive accretion",
    ", high - mass stars are forming in the center of the protoclusters .",
    "indeed , the gravitational force of the protocluster inside which stars are competitively accreting attracts a significant fraction of the gas ( and the stars ) towards the cluster center .    a recent observational and theoretical study of a @xmath1510@xmath39 clump in ngc  2264 suggests an intermediate situation between the competitive accretion and the massive turbulent core model ( peretto et al .",
    "the ngc  2264 clump seems indeed to be globally collapsing while well - defined condensations independently develop and collapse .",
    "moreover , the gravitational merging of a few class  0 protostellar cores may be occurring in the center of the massive clump .      in this scenario , originally proposed by bonnell et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , the massive stars form by the coalescence of a large number of low - mass protostars .",
    "the original motivations for proposing stellar collisions as a formation process for massive stars was , first , to circumvent the radiative pressure effect and , second , to explain the large number of massive stars in dense stellar clusters .",
    "today , the first problem is known to be alleviate by the flashlight effect ( see sect .",
    "2.3.1 ) whereas the second remains for a few exceptional cases of high - mass star formation .    to estimate the star density required for the stellar collisions to be important , it is necessary to compare the collision time scale and the stellar evolution time .",
    "the former can be estimated using the stellar collision time per star ( binney & tremaine @xcite ) .",
    "typical stellar densities of about @xmath40  pc@xmath41 are required to set reasonable values of the mass , size , and velocity dispersion for the stellar collision partners .",
    "non - equal mass encounters , circumstellar disks , and binary components could decrease this number to about 10@xmath42 pc@xmath41 , but such stellar density is highly unlikely to be the general case of high - mass star - forming sites .",
    "the fundamental unknown of high - mass star formation remains the physical process leading to stellar masses larger than @xmath2 . as explained in sect .  2",
    ", there are two competing families of models based on either accretion or coalescence with currently a slight advantage for the accretion scenarios .",
    "observations can help end this debate by giving strong contraints on the evolutionary sequence and the initial conditions of ob star formation .",
    "we summarize below our limited knowledge of these topics and list related open questions ( see also beuther et al .",
    "@xcite ) .      unlike for low - mass stars",
    "( see , e.g. , fig .  1 of the chapter on low - mass star formation )",
    ", there is no observational evolutionary sequence which is firmly established for masssive young stellar objects ( massive ysos ) .",
    "several attempts to derive evolutionary scenarios have been made by using three types of diagnostics : + ( 1 ) the theoretical development of an h region has triggered the empirical classification from initially hyper - compact h ( hch ) regions to ultra - compact h ( uch ) regions , compact h regions , and then classical / developed h regions ( see @xcite and references therein ) ; + ( 2 ) since the warm inner parts of high - mass protostellar envelopes evolve with time , the physical and chemical properties of a hot core ( e.g. , its size , temperature , molecular abundances , and associated masers ) can in principle be used as a clock ( e.g. helmich & van dishoeck @xcite ; garay & lizano @xcite ) ; + ( 3 ) inspired by the sequence from class  0 to class  i observed for low - mass protostars ( e.g. andr et al.@xcite and sect .",
    "3.1 of the chapter on low - mass star formation ) , the ratio of submillimeter to bolometric luminosity has also been employed for ob - type protostellar objects ( e.g. , molinari et al .",
    "@xcite ; motte et al .",
    "+ following these empirical diagnostics , objects associated with the first phase of high - mass star formation have been called massive starless or pre - stellar cores , massive cold molecular cores , or even infrared - dark clouds . in the subsequent phase ,",
    "they have been named massive protostars , high - mass protostellar objects , or hot molecular cores .",
    "the better - known final phase would correspond to h regions being from hyper - compact to classical .",
    "unfortunately , the above evolutionary scenarios are not quantitative enough to constrain models of high - mass star formation .",
    "most of the questions related to the earliest phases of this process ( i.e. the two first phases mentioned above ) remain : what are their lifetimes ? how do their luminosity and spectral energy distributions ( seds ) evolve with time ? ...      since the earliest phases of high - mass star formation have long escaped observations , the characteristics of the initial cloud core or cloud structure that will form a high - mass star remain unknown . here",
    "are a few basic questions we need to answer : do singular massive pre - stellar cores exist ? are these hotter , denser , more turbulent , more magnetized , or more dynamic than their low - mass analogs ?",
    "do their characteristics permit the development of accretion rates @xmath15100 times higher than those of lower - mass protostars ? will they allow an effective coalescence of protostars in their inner parts ?",
    "+ besides , since high - mass star - forming regions are more exposed to shock waves ( powered by , e.g. , ob stellar winds and ionization fronts ) , the formation of high - mass stars may be more commonly triggered than that of low - mass stars . when the impact of external triggers on clouds is constructive ( see elmegreen @xcite for a review ) , how does the initial high - mass pre - stellar core form ? and do external disturbances precipitate its collapse ? + in the following , we review the major studies that have searched for the precursors of h regions and describe the future _ herschel _ key programmes dedicated to high - mass star formation . for a meaningful comparison of the massive ysos identified by these studies ( see table  1 ) , we choose to use the terminology recommended by williams et al .",
    "( @xcite ) : `` clumps '' are @xmath151  pc cloud structures , `` dense cores '' have @xmath150.1  pc and `` condensations '' @xmath150.01  pc sizes .

    "three guaranteed time and one major open time key programmes are worth mentioning :    * `` hobys '' ( the _ herschel _ imaging survey of ob young stellar objects ) is a guaranteed time key programme jointly proposed by the spire and pacs consortia , and the herschel science centre ( see http://starformation-herschel.iap.fr/hobys/ ) . coordinated by motte , zavagno , and bontemps , it is the only _ herschel _ key programme which is exclusively dedicated to high - mass star formation .",
