    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are the most dramatic astronomical phenomena in the universe ( zhang & mszros 2004 ; mszros 2006 ) .",
    "the prompt emissions of grbs last from a few milliseconds to thousands of seconds .",
    "the statistics of their durations are shown as a bimodal distribution ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "1993 ) , and therefore grbs can be classified as short- and long - duration grbs .",
    "the progenitors of them are believed to be the mergers of two compact objects ( see e.g. , eichler et al .",
    "1989 ; paczyski 1991 ; narayan et al . 1992 ) or the collapsars of massive stars ( see e.g. , woosley 1993 ) , respectively . despite of the different progenitors , a rotating black hole ( bh ) surrounded by a neutrino - dominated accretion flow ( ndaf ,",

    "the jet precession caused by the system of the bh and disc can also explain some periodic variabilities of x - ray binaries , such as ss 433 ( sarazin et al .",
    "quasi - periodic feature observed by batse in the gamma - ray lightcurves motivates the idea that the grb jet may be precessed ( see , e.g. , blackman et al .",
    "1996 ; portegies zwart et al .",
    "1999 ) . in the central engine of grbs ,",
    "either the misalignment of angular momenta of two compact objects or the anisotropic fall - back mass in collapsar may induce the precession between the bh and the accretion flow . according to the bardeen - petterson effect ( bardeen & petterson 1975 )",
    ", we suggest that in the jet precession model the bh can capture the inner part of the ndaf to conform with the direction of the angular momentum , and the outer part of the ndaf drives the bh and inner part to precess ( liu et al .",
    "2010a ; liu & xue 2012 ) .",
    "the model can be used to explain the temporal structure and spectral evolution of grbs ( liu et al .",
    "2010a ) , to simulate almost all types of the gamma - ray lightcurve of grbs ( portegies zwart et al .",
    "1999 ; lei et al .",
    "2007 ) , and to predict the intensities of the gravitational waves from grbs ( romero et al . 2010 ; sun et al . 2012 ) .",
    "however , compared with the observations of the gamma - ray emission , there is little x - ray observational evidence of precession in grbs .    in the paper",
    ", we will analyse the variability of the x - ray bump in grb 121027a and discuss its possible origin by using our jet precession model . in section 2",
    ", we describe the _",
    "swift_/xrt observations of grb 121027a and use the stepwise filter correlation method , coupled with the lomb - scargle method , to present the analysis of the quasi - periodic x - ray lightcurve from about 5300 s to about 6100 s since trigger . in section 3 , the jet precession model is introduced .",
    "for the reasonable properties of the bh in the centre of collapsar , the model can explain the x - ray lightcurve of grb 121027a .",
    "the conclusions and discussion are presented in section 4 .",
    "the _ swift_/xrt began observation at 67.4 s after grb 121027a trigger and received about @xmath1 s data ( evans et al .",
    "it is one of the typical ultra - long grbs ( e.g. , peng et al .",
    "2013 ; levan et al . 2014 ) .",
    "the redshift was about 1.773 ( tanvir et al .",
    "2012 ; kruehler et al . 2012 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the _",
    "swift_/xrt lightcurve , in which the data is downloaded from the uk swift science data centre at the university of leicester ( evans et al . 2007 , 2009 ) .",
    "the x - ray lightcurve of grb 121027a shows six components : a step decay phase from about 70 s to about 200 s with the temporal index about 1.8 , a flare from about 200 s to about 500 s , another steep decay phase after the flare from about 500 s to about 1000 s with the power index about 7 , a giant bump from about 1 ks to about 20 ks , a plateau phase from about 20 ks to about 100 ks ( or from about 1 ks to about 100 ks ) with the decay index about 0.34 , and another normal decay phase from about 100 ks to the end with the temporal index about 1.44 .",
    "it is rare that two continuous step decay phases with different temporal indexes exist in the afterglow .",
    "most of the lightcurve components are easily understood , except for the giant bump , which is the most interesting phenomenon in grb 121027a observations ( e.g. , peng et al .",
    "2013 ; wu et al .",
    "the related models were proposed , including the fall - back accretion process in collapsars ( wu et al .",
    "2013 ) and a blue supergiant progenitor ( e.g. , stratta et al .",
    "the shape of the particular x - ray bump of grb 121027a is quite different from that of the typical x - ray flares in grbs .",
    "furthermore , we carefully analyze the substructures of lightcurve in the x - ray bump and find that there exist many violent oscillations .",
    "there are some substructures in the lightcurve from about 1170 s to about 1210 s , from about 5300s to about 6100 s , from about 11200 s to about 12000 s , and from about 16400 s to about 17600 s , as shown in figure 2 , which are quite different from the smooth lightcurves of the typical x - ray afterglow in grbs .",
    "the red lines represent the links of the data in figure 2 ( a ) and ( d ) and the smooth curves for the data in figure 2 ( b ) and ( c ) . obviously , the timescales of oscillations in the four parts of the bump are from about tens of seconds to hundreds of seconds , which indicate that there may exist a rough time evolution in the lightcurve from about 1170 s to about 17600 s.    the stepwise filter correlation ( sfc ) method is used to decompose the variability components of lightcurves ( see , e.g. , gao et al .",
    "the method can identify significant clustering structures of a lightcurve in the frequency domain , but it can not give the statistical significance and location of the structure .",
    "it is based on a low - pass filter technique and progressively filter the high - frequency signals .",
    "then it performs a correlation analysis between each adjunct pair of filtered lightcurves .",
    "the correlation coefficient as a function of the filter frequency would display a prominent `` valley '' feature around the frequency of the `` slow '' variability component , which can inspect the periodic signals .",
    "the detailed description can be found in gao et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , which analyzed 266 grbs observed by batse .",
    "lei et al . ( 2013 ) applied the method to sw j1644 + 57 and found a 2.7-day period .",
    "we use the sfc method to process the data of the giant bump .",
    "however , the quality of the most data is not good . only the data from about 5300 s to about 6100 s can be analyzed in details .",
    "for the observations from about 1170 s to about 1210 s and from about 16400 s to about 17600 s , the data are too rare to be analyzed by the sfc method . for the data from about 11200",
    "s to about 12000 s , there is no indication of period by analysis using the method , because the modulation of flux and the fluence are too small .             for the observations from about 5300 s to about 6100 s , because the data from _",
    "swift_/xrt observations are not equal to the bins , we first use the insert method to make the data equal to the interval for subsequent analysis .",
    "the errors of the data are taken as @xmath2 of the flux .",
    "we first perform an analysis to the lightcurve as shown in figure 3(a ) . using the method",
    ", the 86 s dip clearly shows up in figure 3(b ) , which implies that there may exist a time structure lasting @xmath3 86 s , corresponding to about 31 s in the rest frame .",
    "as shown in the lightcurve , we notice that the modulation of the flux after about 5700 s is very significant and there exist some peaks with the similar interval among each other , which indeed contains the periodic signals and dominates the analytic results . on the contrary ,",
    "the circumstance of the data before about 5700 s is uncertain , because the small amplitude can not be analyzed by sfc method separately .",
    "following gao et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , we use monte carlo simulation to evaluate the error range of the period and quantify the significance for the detection of such quasi - periodic oscillations .",
    "first , for each time bin with a observed count rate @xmath4 and count rate error @xmath5 , which is taken as 5@xmath6 of the flux , we can generate a mock count rate by randomly generating the data based on a normal distribution with ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) .",
    "1000 mock light curves will be generated and we apply the sfc method to each mock light curve , and we can check whether the 86 s quasi - period exists . we propose that the percentage of mock light curves that contains 86s quasi - period , @xmath7 , can be essentially acted as the significance parameter .",
    "it turns out @xmath8 for 5300 s to 6100 s data .",
    "second , to estimate the period error , we perform the monte carlo simulation again but allow random seed error for each time to be @xmath9 of the original count rate error , i.e. , generating the data based on a normal distribution with ( @xmath4 , @xmath10 ) , and then identify the quasi - period , if exists .",
    "figure 3(c ) shows the distribution of quasi - period for mock light curves .",
    "the distribution fitting parameters with a statistical average of period and its variance are 84.24 s and 7.65 s ( @xmath11 error ) .",
    "we thus propose to use @xmath12 as the quasi - period error , i.e. , the period is @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , we use the lomb - scargle method ( scargle 1982 ) to examine the results by the sfc method , which is based on the discrete fourier transform and is usually used to analyze the period of the exoplanet . as shown in figure 3(d ) , if we set the range of the possible period from 80 s to 100 s and analyze the data from 5300 s to 6100 s by the method , a @xmath3 86 s periodicity with the confidence of 97.3 @xmath6 is obtained .",
    "such a result is consistent with the analysis by the sfc method .",
    "although the progenitors of the two types of grbs may be different , their central engines are similar , i.e. , the bh hyperaccretion model .",
    "such system drives an ultra - relativistic jet to produce both the prompt gamma - rays emission and afterglow in lower energy bands , whose orientation coincides with the direction of the angular momentum of the bh ( e.g. , popham et al .",
    "1999 ; liu et al . 2007 ;",
    "liu et al . 2010a ; liu & xue 2012 ) . the different direction of the angular momentum between the bh and disc can induce the disc to tilt and jet to precess ( liu et al .",
    "2010a ; sun et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "according to equations ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 5 ) of sun et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and equations ( 5.6 ) and ( 5.7 ) of popham et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , the analytic expression of the precession period @xmath13 can be expressed as ( hou et al .",
    "2014 ) @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are respectively the dimensionless spin parameter ( @xmath17 ) and mass of the bh , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are respectively the accretion rate and the viscosity parameter of the disc .",
    "if the x - ray bumps or flares originate from the bh hyperaccretion processes , we can connect the observed x - ray luminosity @xmath20 of the bumps or flares with the mass accretion rate @xmath18 through @xmath21 where @xmath22 includes the beaming effect and efficiency of converting accretion material to x - ray radiation . for the power mechanisms , both neutrino annihilations and magnetic processes",
    "have been included in the above equation .    for grb 121027a ,",
    "if the bump originates from the fall - back accretion process ( e.g. , wu et al . 2013 ) , the precession between the bh and disc may exist due to the possible anisotropic distribution of the angular momentum of the fall - back materials . from equation ( 1 ) , following the bh hyperaccretion process , the bh mass increases and the mass and angular momentum of the disc decreases , which may cause that the precession period increases with time .",
    "thus the change of the bh accretion system can result in the evolution of the periods .",
    "unfortunately , except the data from about 5300 s to about 6100 s , we can not analyze the oscillations of the other data in the bump to estimate the evolution .",
    "we can further test our jet precession model with the possible quasi - periodic variability of the bump .",
    "the average x - ray luminosity @xmath20 from about 5300 s to 6100 s is about @xmath23 erg @xmath24 ( wu et al . 2013 ) .",
    "we reasonably assume that @xmath22 is about @xmath25 , so @xmath18 is estimated by equation ( 2 ) as nearly @xmath26 .",
    "if we consider that the effect of the magnetic field in ndaf models , the low accretion rate can also ignite the disc to maintain neutrino emission ( e.g. , kawanaka et al .",
    "2013 ; luo et al .",
    "in addition , for bz mechanism to power grbs , the requirements for accretion rate can be even lower .",
    "since the duration of the burst in the rest frame corresponds to the viscous timescale , which is inversely proportional to the viscosity parameter , a long - duration accretion process certainly requires a low viscosity parameter . for the accretion timescale lasting about ten thousands seconds",
    ", @xmath19 can be estimated as @xmath27 by @xmath28 ( e.g. , hou et al .",
    "the spin parameter @xmath15 is naturally assumed to be 0.9 after hyperaccretion process lasting thousands of seconds ( e.g. , wu et al .",
    "the precession period is about @xmath29 for grb 121027a in the rest frame , the mass of the bh can be calculated as about @xmath30 with equation ( 1 ) .",
    "after thousands of seconds hyperaccretion process , the final mass of the bh is well consistent with the collapsar models ( e.g. , popham et al .",
    "1999 ) , which indicates the jet precession model may naturally explain the origin of the bump in grb 121027a .",
    "we roughly analyze the timescales of oscillations in the four parts of the bump , which indicate that there may exist the time evolution in the bump of grb 121027a , and find there may exist @xmath0 periodic signals from about 5300 s to about 6100 s by using the sfc method .",
    "the result is confirmed by the lomb - scargle method .",
    "if the bump originates from the fall - back accretion process , we argue that the quasi - periodic oscillations may be caused by the jet precession in the bh - ndaf system . our model ( liu et al .",
    "2010a ) can explain the behaviours , and the final properties of the bh are well consistent with the collapsar models .",
    "thus it is a possible method to test or estimate the mass of the bh in the centre of a grb due to the quasi - period oscillations of the lightcurve in the future observations .    for the prompt emission , gao et al .",
    "( 2012 ) performed sfc method to 266 grbs in batse sample .",
    "although no quasi - periodic oscillations was claimed in their work , they indeed found that the majority of the bursts had clear evidence of containing a  slow \" variability component superposed on a rapidly varying time sequence .",
    "furthermore , we searched all the _ swift_/xrt samples .",
    "the light curves of most flares and afterglows are smooth , thus the quasi - periodic oscillations do not exist . for the ultra - long grbs",
    ", we found a possible sample in the data of grb 101225a .",
    "we used the sfc method to analyze its data from about 4950 s to about 7300 s , and did not find the periodic signals",
    ".    furthermore , fan et al .",
    "( 2005 ) suggested that if jet powering the late x - ray flares is launched via magnetic processes , such as grb 050724 , the radiation of the flares is expected to be linearly polarized . as well as",
    "the bump of grb 121027a , given the requirement for accretion rate ( @xmath31 ) in the jet precession model , the jet is possibly dominated by the magnetic field .",
    "the bump including quasi - periodic signals may be one of the astronomical candidate sources of linearly polarized .",
    "future grbs observations by the polar detector ( bao et al . 2012 ) may test this possibility .",
