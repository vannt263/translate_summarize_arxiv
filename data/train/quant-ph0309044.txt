    "quantum entanglement is a very important property of quantum mechanics .",
    "it is the foundation of quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum computation @xcite , quantum cryptography @xcite , superdense coding @xcite , etc . up to now",
    "most of the theoretical discussions and experiments are focused on quantum states belonging to two - dimensional states , or qubits@xcite . in recent years",
    ", the interest in multi - dimensional states , or qudits , is steadily growing for its promise to realize new types of quantum communication protocols@xcite , and its properties in quantum cryptography better than qubits@xcite .",
    "these theoretical disscussions@xcite and experiments@xcite about multi - dimensional states are mostly based on the orbital angular momentum ( oam ) of the photons .",
    "it has been shown that paraxial laguerre - gaussian(lg ) laser beams carry a well - defined orbital angular momentum@xcite , and that the lg modes form a complete hilbert set .",
    "the down - converted photons from spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) are entangled in not only polarization , or spin angular momentum , but also oam@xcite .",
    "this provides a promise to explore multi - dimensional quantum state in one photon @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the relative amplitude of oam of the down - converted photons from spdc and analyze the possible joint detection probability under the influence of the experiment elements .",
    "our results show that the relative amplitude decreases almost exponentially with the growing of oam . and only a few dimensions can be explored from the infinite oam modes of the down - converted photon pairs . in section @xmath2",
    ", we briefly introduce the lg mode , and calculate the relative amplitude of every lg mode of the down converted photons from spdc in detail . in theory , the relative amplitude determines the joint detection probability . however , in practical experiments , the computer generated holograms and the mono - mode fibres will inevitably influence the joint detection probability .",
    "we discuss the mode analysis after the computer generated hologram in section @xmath3 .",
    "section @xmath4 analyzes the detection efficiency of mono - mode fibre for every lg  mode .",
    "section @xmath5 presents the possible joint detection probability , when the effects of the holograms and mono - mode fibres are both included .",
    "the last section is the conclusion .",
    "it is well known that photons can carry both spin angular momentum and oam@xcite .",
    "spin angular momentum is associated with polarization and oam with the azimuthal phase of the electric field .",

    "@xmath13 is the beam width at the beam waist , the index @xmath14 is referred to as the winding number , and @xmath15 is the number of radial nodes .",
    "if the mode function is a pure lg mode with winding number @xmath14 , then every photon of this beam carries an oam of @xmath16 .",
    "this corresponds to an eigenstate of the oam operator with eigenvalue @xmath16@xcite .",
    "if the mode function is not a pure lg mode , the state is a superposition state , with the weights dictated by the contribution of the @xmath14th angular harmonics .    at the beam waist @xmath17",
    ", the lg mode can be written as    @xmath18    in the following calculation , we use this equation because in the experiment we always manipulate the light at its beam waist .    in the spdc process ,",
    "a thin quadratic nonlinear crystal is illuminated by a laser pump beam propagating in the @xmath19 direction , with wave number @xmath20 and waist @xmath13 .",
    "the generated two - photon quantum state is given by@xcite    @xmath21    where @xmath22 corresponds to the mode of the signal beam and @xmath23 the mode of the idler beam .",

    "the weights of the quantum superposition are given by @xmath30 .",
    "it is the ideal joint detection probability for finding one photon in the signal mode @xmath22 and one photon in the idler mode @xmath23 .",
    "consider the case that the pump beam is in a pure lg mode @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",

    "we can also illustrate the dependence of the relative probability amplitude @xmath52 on @xmath53 and @xmath14 , with fig .",
    "1(@xmath54 and @xmath55 ) and fig . 2(@xmath56 and @xmath57 ) .    from the above table and figures",
    ", we can see that the probability amplitude decreases very rapidly with the growing of @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath14 .",
    "we then just consider the cases with @xmath49 @xmath50 and @xmath51 when @xmath60 @xmath61 .",
    "in papers@xcite , they also just consider the cases with @xmath51 .",
    "if additionally assume @xmath56 as in the previous works@xcite , we can obtain :    @xmath62    this result can also be achieved from the eq .",
    "@xmath63 of the paper@xcite , when the condition @xmath64 is assumed .",
    "but till now , this assumption has not been proven either in theoretical discussions@xcite or in experiments@xcite .",
    "we will discuss the two cases separately in section @xmath5 .",
    "before proceed , we analyze the two main experiment elements , computer generated holograms and mono - mode fibre , which will unavoidably affect the detected relative probability amplitude .",
    "in most of the recent experiments@xcite , the authors always use computer generated holograms to transform gaussian mode light into other lg modes light , or change the winding number of lg mode light .",
    "it is a kind of transmission holograms with the transmittance function :    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is the amplitude of the phase modulation , @xmath67 is the period of the grating at a large distance away from the fork , @xmath68 is the @xmath69 component of the simplest reference beam s wave vector . corresponding to the diffraction order @xmath70",
    ", the hologram can change the winding number of the input beam by @xmath71 .",
    "the diffraction efficiency depends on the phase modulation @xmath66 .",
    "when @xmath72 , almost @xmath73 of the incident intensity is diffracted into the first - order .    however , even the input beam is a pure lg mode light , the output beam after the hologram is not a pure lg mode light",
    ". the output light will be the superposition of the various lg modes with the same @xmath14 , and different @xmath1@xcite .",
    "in addition , the beam waists of the input and output beam will affect the weights of different components of the output beam .",
    "assume the input beam and the output beam have the same waists @xmath13 , thus the complex expansion coefficients of the decomposition of the @xmath70th diffraction order can be calculated as :    @xmath74    where @xmath75 .",
    "consider the first - order diffraction , or @xmath76 , eq .",
    "@xmath77 can be then rewritten as    @xmath78    where @xmath79 is the winding number changed by the hologram .",
    "the relative weight of the output modes is given by    @xmath80    as the mono - mode fibres can only detect the photons with @xmath54 , we consider the case that the output light is in the modes with @xmath81 .",
    "then @xmath82 can be simplified as @xmath83 , and @xmath84 . in most of the experiments@xcite ,",
    "only the holograms of @xmath85 or @xmath2 are employed .",
    "table 2 and table 3 give the relative weight of different modes after the computer generated hologram with @xmath85 and @xmath2 .    from table 2 and table 3",
    ", we can see most of the input mode @xmath86 is converted into @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "thereby , we only consider the case that the output light is in the modes with @xmath89 .",
    "it is known that only one mode of light can transmit in the mono - mode fibre : @xmath90 mode . and",
    "in practical calculation , we always use gaussian mode to replace the @xmath90 mode .",
    "the gaussian mode is    @xmath91    where @xmath92 is the mode field diameter(mfd ) of the fibre , @xmath93 is amplitude of field at the fibre center . for @xmath94 mode light ,",
    "the detection efficiency is given as    @xmath95    obviously if @xmath96 , then @xmath97 .",
    "for the case @xmath54 , eq .",
    "@xmath98 can be simplified as :    @xmath99    to calculate the relative joint detection probability of the down - converted photons from spdc , we only need the relative detection efficiency of the @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 , but not their absolute efficiency .",
    "assume the waist size of the input beam is adjusted equal to @xmath104 .",
    "then when the detection area is much more larger than the cross - section of the input light , only @xmath105 mode light can be detected .",
    "but in practice , the detection area is determined by the fibre diameter . to simplify calculation",
    ", we further assume that the detection area is a round area with diameter equal to the mfd . thus the integral for @xmath106",
    "is from @xmath107 to @xmath108 . with these assumptions ,",
    "the relative efficiencies for @xmath109 can be written as    @xmath110",
    "with the above discussions about the influence of computer generated holograms and mono - mode fibres , we now consider the joint detection probability for oam  entangled photons generated from an experimental set - up similar to the work@xcite . the joint detection probability can be written as    @xmath111    when @xmath54 , @xmath112 gives the joint detection probability that there is no hologram in both the signal and idler beam . and",
    "for the case @xmath96 , @xmath113 represents the joint detection probability with one @xmath114 hologram in the signal beam and one @xmath115 hologram in the idler beam . obviously , @xmath116 .",
    "substitute the values of @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 calculated in the above sections to eq .",
    "@xmath120 , we can get the relative joint detection probability of the three cases @xmath51 as    @xmath121    if we also assume that @xmath56 for the spdc process as the recent papers@xcite , the joint detection probability can thus be written as @xmath122 and the relation for @xmath51 becomes :    @xmath123    the difference between eq . @xmath124 and @xmath125 is caused by the additional assumption that laguerre index @xmath56 . but this assumption has not been proven either in theoretical discussions@xcite or in experiments@xcite . from the above calculations",
    ", we can see that this assumption will cause non - trivial influence to the relative joint detection probability .",
    "our results put forward a feasible method to verify the assumption .",
    "if we rule out the influence of the holograms and mono - mode fibres , and make the assumption of @xmath56 , the relationship for the relative joint detection probability of the cases @xmath51 becomes    @xmath126    compare eq .",
    "@xmath125 with eq .",
    "@xmath127 , we can see that the experimental elements can apparently influence the joint detection probability .    in the experiment by vaziri and co - workers@xcite",
    ", they found that the state of the oam entangled photons from spdc was given by    @xmath128    from this equation we can get the relationship for the relative joint detection probabilities of the cases @xmath129 as    @xmath130    including the influence of computer generated holograms and mono - mode fibres , and loosening the assumption of @xmath56 , we expect this relation be @xmath131 the reason for the difference between eq . @xmath132 and",
    "@xmath133 might be as follows : in experiment , the diffraction efficiency of the hologram can not be @xmath73 .",
    "generally , different holograms have different diffraction efficiencies .",
    "the waists of the input beam and the output beam of holograms will also affect the final experiment detection probabilities .",
    "in addition , the fibre diameter and mfd of the practical mono - mode fibre will also affect the detection efficiencies of different modes light . evidently , the detection efficiency of avalanche detectors has little effect on the relative joint detection probabilities .",
    "thus in the practical experiment , the @xmath118 and @xmath134values have to be adjusted according to the particular conditions .",
    "in conclusion , we have calculated the probability amplitudes of different lg modes of the down converted photons .",
    "our results show that the relative amplitude decreases almost exponentially with growing of oam .",
    "we also discussed the impact of the previous assumption for @xmath1 on the joint detection probability .",
    "in addition , we analyzed the influences of the experiment elements .",
    "we concluded that only a few dimensions can be explored from the infinite oam modes of the down - converted photon pairs .",
