    "negative ions in supercritical gases are an interesting subject for several reasons .",
    "the formation of anions as a consequence of low - energy electron impact to a molecule has important consequences in the chemistry of atmosphere , of discharges , and in electro and biochemistry .",
    "electron attachment and detachment processes , leading to the formation and decay of anions are strongly influenced by the environment @xcite . upon creation and stabilization , they interact with the environment leading to states that can not be adiabatically obtained by a simple addition of the ion to the surrounding system @xcite .",
    "the investigation of the transport properties of ions in a dense supercritical gas gives important pieces of information about their structure and interaction with the host @xcite and bridge the gap between dilute gases @xcite and liquids @xcite .",
    "anions are difficult to produce even in a dense environment , with the noticeable exception of oxygen and sf@xmath4 that are very electronegative .",
    "in particular , o@xmath5 is an ubiquitous species , present as impurity even in the best purified rare gas .",
    "resonant electron attachment @xcite , followed by stabilization induced by three  body collisions @xcite , produces stable o@xmath6 ions that can be easily drifted through the gas under the action of an externally applied electric field .    the o@xmath6 ion couples with the gas by means of electrostriction @xcite .",
    "its strong field polarizes the surrounding atoms which are attracted toward the ion that becomes solvated in a cluster .",
    "electrostriction thus induces rapidly varying density and viscosity profiles around the ion @xcite that affect the ion mobility @xmath7 in these conditions , the ion transport is actually determined by the hydrodynamic interaction of the large solvation structure surrounding the ion with the gas and is quite insensitive to the ionic species .",
    "whereas @xmath0 in he at @xmath8 k @xcite does not show any particular features as a function of the gas density @xmath9 up to moderate values , it shows a smooth change of behavior when @xmath9 is varied across the critical density @xmath10nm@xmath11 in ne gas @xmath12k above the critical temperature @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath9 for @xmath14 has been described in terms of the stokes hydrodynamic formula relating @xmath0 to ion radius @xmath15 and fluid viscosity @xmath16 @xmath17 in which @xmath18 is evaluated for the density of the maximum of the density profile induced by electrostriction @xcite .",
    "further measurements in near critical ar gas @xcite have confirmed that the coupling of the ion motion with the critical fluctuations via electrostriction is responsible for the change of behavior of @xmath0 near the critical point .",
    "the behavior close to @xmath19 has been explained by modifying the stokes s formula in order to account for the fact that the large gas compressibility forces a layer of correlated fluid to stick around the ion . in order to test this interpretation at microscopic level , molecular dynamics",
    "( md ) simulations are performed .",
    "the experimental results of the measurements of the o@xmath6 ion density - normalized mobility @xmath20 in dense supercritical ar for @xmath21 @xmath22 and @xmath23k are shown in fig . [",
    "fig : misure ] .",
    "details on the experiment and on the previous analysis are found in literature @xcite .    for a density",
    "@xmath24nm@xmath25 @xmath0 shows a defect whose strength increases when @xmath26k .",
    "the solid line through the data on the isotherm closest to @xmath19 is obtained by using the stokes formula with an ion radius @xmath15 that is enhanced with respect to the radius in absence of electrostriction and criticality by an amount that depends on the local value of the fluid correlation lenght @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the good agreement confirms the picture of a correlated fluid layer dragged by the ion because of electrostriction . for @xmath28nm@xmath25",
    "the hydrodynamic description fails to reproduce the data because the ion transport leaves the hydrodynamic regime to enter the kinetic one .",
    "a new analysis of the data reveals that the locus of the maximum mobility defect lies on the extrapolation of the coexistence curve into the single phase region , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : extrcoex ] .",
    "the same occurs for @xmath29he@xmath30 ions in @xmath29he near the critical point for @xmath31k @xcite.the gas appears reminiscent of the nearby coexistence curve even for @xmath32 droplets of superheated liquid are formed in the gas because of critical fluctuations .",
    "electrostriction makes the local pressure around the ion rise through the extrapolation of the coexistence line into the region of superheated liquid that the strong ion field stabilizes thermodynamically .",
    "this situation is also similar to the case of @xmath33he@xmath30 ions near the melting transition in which the @xmath34-line is extrapolated into the region of supercooled , electrostrictively - stabilized liquid surrounding the ion @xcite .    to get a microscopic insight of the ionic transport process , classical molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations",
    "have been carried out in which the newtonian equations of motion are numerically integrated for suitable interaction potentials by using freely available fortran codes @xcite .",
    "a system of 100 ar atoms plus 1 o@xmath6 ion has been simulated as a function of @xmath9 for @xmath35k . the ar  ar interaction potential is found in literature @xcite .",
    "the dominant long - range part of the o@xmath36ar potential can be calculated by the knowledge of the polarizabilities of o@xmath6 and ar and of the quadrupole moment of ar @xcite .",
    "the repulsive part of the o@xmath36ar potential has been modeled as the interaction of the neutral species with an infinite wall endowed with a local charge density equal to the electronic charge density of the ion @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion are integrated by using the verlet algorithm @xcite in time steps of @xmath37s , where @xmath38 is the timescale in atomic units ( a.u . ) .",
    "after an initial equilibration time , the system evolves freely .",
    "the coordinates of all particles are recorded every time interval @xmath39 spanning a total simulation time @xmath40ns for @xmath41 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rms ] we report a typical example of the mean square displacement @xmath42 of the ion and of ar for @xmath43nm@xmath25 and @xmath35k . for ar , it is less noisy because of the higher statistical significance due to the averaging over 100 atoms .",
    "as expected , the ion is less mobile than the neutral atoms because the enhancement of its interaction with atoms due to its electric field .",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath44 is obtained as @xmath45 in order to improve the statistical significance of the data , a running average of the diffusion coefficient @xmath46 is first calculated by evaluating @xmath42 for each @xmath47 by moving the time origin across the whole simulation and averaging over the results before averaging over the sampling window @xmath48 in fig .",
    "[ fig : ddt ] a typical result for the running average of @xmath46 is plotted as a function of the sampling window @xmath49 the error bars are the results of averaging over the different time origins . for practical purposes , the limit in the definition of @xmath44 is replaced by the mean of the running average @xmath50 finally , the nernst ",

    "[ fig : cfrdatsim ] the md results for @xmath35k are compared with the experimental data .",
    "the quantitative agreement between data and simulation is very good .",
    "the simulated @xmath0 shows the defect exactly at the same density of the experiment .",
    "the density width of the mobility defect calculated in the simulations is larger than the experimental one .",
    "it is believed that this effect is due to the fact that the temperature during simulation is allowed to substantially fluctuate in order for energy to be constant .",
    "disappointingly , however , md simulations do not enlighten the physical reasons of their success .",
    "actually , md calculations also provide the ion  atom pair distribution function @xmath55 that gives important information on the structure of the ion environment .",
    "in particular , the excess number @xmath56 of atoms surrounding the ion can be calculated . in fig .",
    "[ fig : nexcr ] @xmath56 is reported as a function of the distance @xmath57 from the ion for @xmath9 close to that of the mobility minimum .",
