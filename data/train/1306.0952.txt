    "white dwarf - main sequence binaries ( wdms ) are compact binary stars that descend from main sequence binaries , and are among the most common compact binary objects in the galaxy . the majority ( @xmath575 per cent ) of the initial main sequence binaries from which wdms binaries derive",
    "have orbital separations wide enough to avoid mass transfer interactions .",
    "therefore the primary ( or more massive ) main sequence star evolves as a single star and the orbital separation widens as a result of the primary losing mass at the asymptotic giant branch @xcite . in the remaining ( @xmath525 per cent ) of the cases the main sequence stars are close enough for mass transfer to be initiated via roche - lobe overflow once the primary ascends the red giant branch or the the asymptotic giant branch .",
    "unstable mass transfer to the secondary main sequence companion generally brings the system into a common envelope phase ( ce ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in which the orbital separation dramatically decreases due to drag forces of the binary components with the material of the envelope , formed by the outer layers of the giant .",
    "the energy released due to the shrinkage of the orbit is used to expel the envelope @xcite , exposing a post - ce binary ( pceb ) composed of the core of the giant , i.e. the future white dwarf , and the secondary main sequence companion .",
    "the orbital period distribution of wdms binaries is therefore bimodal , with the close pcebs peaking at short orbital periods of @xmath58 hours @xcite and the systems that did not evolve through a ce phase at much wider orbital separations ( orbital periods @xmath6100days , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "after the envelope is ejected , pcebs continue to evolve to even shorter orbital periods through angular momentum loss driven by magnetic braking and/or gravitational wave emission .",
    "therefore pcebs may either undergo a second phase of ce evolution ( leading to double - degenerate white dwarfs ) , or enter a semi - detached state ( and appear as cataclysmic variables or super - soft x - ray sources ) .",
    "thanks to the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the number of wdms binaries has increased from a few ten @xcite to over two thousand @xcite .",
    "the latest version of our wdms binary catalogue @xcite , based on sdss data release ( dr ) 7 , contains 2248 systems , and represents the most complete and homogeneous sample .",
    "follow - up observational studies based on this large sample have led to the identification of a large number of wide binaries and close pcebs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that are being used to study several different and important aspects in modern astrophysics ( e.g. providing crucial constraints on current theories of ce evolution @xcite and on the origin of low - mass white dwarfs @xcite ; testing theoretical mass - radius relations of both white dwarfs and low - mass main sequence stars @xcite ; and constraining the pairing properties of main sequence stars @xcite ) .",
    "the currently known population of sdss wdms binaries is formed by systems observed as part of the first and second phases of the operation of sdss : sdss - i and sdss - ii . whilst sdss - i focused on targeting galaxies and quasars @xcite ,",
    "sdss - ii carried out three different surveys @xcite : the sloan legacy survey that completed the original sdss - i imaging and spectroscopic goals ; the segue survey ( the sdss extension for galactic understanding and exploration , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , that obtained additional imaging over a large range of galactic latitudes as well as spectroscopy for @xmath7 stars ; and the sloan supernova survey that carried out repeat imaging of the 300 square degree southern equatorial stripe to discover and measure supernovae and other variable objects .    due to the overlap between the colours of wdms binaries containing hot white dwarfs and/or late - type ( m dwarf ) companions and those of quasars @xcite , the target selection algorithm of both sdss - i and the legacy survey of sdss - ii resulted in a large number of wdms binaries with available sdss spectroscopy .",
    "segue additionally performed a dedicated survey for finding wdms binaries containing cool white dwarfs and/or early - type m dwarfs / late - type k dwarfs based on colour selection criteria developed by our team @xcite .",
    "however , despite the success of our segue survey , the 251 systems identified in this way represent only @xmath510 per cent of the known population of sdss wdms binaries , hence remain still clearly under - represented .",
    "moreover , it is important to bear in mind that any wdms binary sample based on optical colours / spectra alone , such as the sdss sample , is bound to be incomplete as only binaries with both components visible at optical wavelengths can be identified .",
    "the aim of this paper is to build on the spectroscopic sdss wdms binary catalogue by identifying wdms binaries within the photometric footprint of sdss dr8 without the need of sdss spectra , and to extend the parameter range of the known wdms binary population by extending the wavelength range used for their identification , thus overcoming the selection effects just described . for this purpose",
    ", we develop colour selection criteria based on a combination of sdss optical plus infrared magnitudes for selecting wdms binaries , specifically focused on detecting systems containing cool white dwarfs and/or companions dominating the system luminosity , which are predicted to represent a large fraction of the intrinsic population @xcite . in addition , we search for new spectroscopic wdms binaries observed by dr8 .",
    "we select photometric wdms binary candidates following a two - step procedure .",
    "first , we apply colour selection criteria based on sdss @xmath0 magnitudes , which allows us to exclude single main - sequence stars .",
    "second , we search for available infrared excess detections of our selected candidates and apply additional colour cuts based on a combination of optical plus infrared magnitudes .",
    "this efficiently excludes quasars from our candidate list and selects wdms binaries dominated by the flux of the secondary star , i.e. systems that contain cool white dwarfs and/or early - type ( m dwarf ) main sequence companions .",
    "sdss wdms binaries form a `` bridge '' in colour space that connects the white dwarf locus to that of low - mass stars @xcite . based on this bridge",
    "we develop the following colour criteria for selecting wdms binaries within sdss :             vs. @xmath12 plane ( black solid dots ) .",
    "spectroscopically confirmed sdss wdms binaries from @xcite are shown as red solid dots and main sequence stars as gray solid dots .",
    "bottom panel : @xmath12 cumulative distribution of the photometrically selected candidates . ]",
    "we use the @xmath13 interface @xcite to select the number of point sources with clean photometry and magnitude errors below 0.1 within the photometric data base of sdss dr8 , satisfying our colour selection .",
    "this search results in 953835 wdms binary candidates ( see table[t - num ] ) , illustrated as black solid dots in the @xmath14 vs. @xmath12 plane ( top panel of figure[f - first ] ) .",
    "for comparison , we show also main sequence stars ( gray solid dots ) and the 2248 spectroscopically confirmed wdms binaries from sdss dr7 ( red solid dots , @xcite ) . in the bottom panel of figure[f - first ]",
    "we represent the @xmath12 cumulative distribution of our 953835 selected sources .",
    "a close inspection of the bottom panel of figure[f - first ] reveals that @xmath150.6 for @xmath1690 per cent of our wdms binary candidates .",
    "these systems are concentrated near the main sequence star locus ( see top panel of figure[f - first ] ) , and overlap only with @xmath53 per cent of the spectroscopically confirmed wdms binaries .",
    "inspection of sdss spectra of objects falling within this colour space reveals @xmath598 per cent of these systems being galaxies .",
    "we therefore decide to refine our selection criteria to exclude these objects from our sample and re - write equation6 as follows :      our refined selection criteria are shown on the top panels of figure[f - newcuts ] ( black solid lines ) and reduce the number of photometrically selected wdms binary candidates to 67378 ( see table[t - num ] ) . for comparison , main sequence stars ( gray solid dots ) , quasars ( green solid dots ) and",
    "spectroscopically confirmed sdss wdms binaries ( red solid dots ) are also shown . from figure[f - newcuts ] ( top panels ) it is apparent that single main sequence stars are efficiently excluded with our colour selection .",
    "however , our sample is expected to be highly contaminated by quasars .",
    "single white dwarfs are also expected to be a large source of contamination , as white dwarf colours are similar to those of wdms binaries in which the white dwarf flux dominates the spectral energy distribution .",

    "<S> the bulk of the dr8 spectroscopy is made up of main - sequence stars and red giants that were targeted as part of the sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration ( segue ) survey , therefore the number of new spectroscopic wdms binaries in dr8 is very small compared to previous sdss data releases . despite their low number , dr8 wdms binaries are found to be dominated by systems containing cool white dwarfs and therefore represent an important addition to the spectroscopic sample . </S>",
    "<S> the updated sdss dr8 spectroscopic catalogue of wdms binaries consists of 2316 systems . </S>",
