    "since the beginning of the investigations on the mechanism of particle acceleration at shock fronts , estimating the maximum energy of the accelerated particles has been one of the main goals , in the perspective of assessing the ability of the mechanism to explain the observed energies in cosmic rays .",
    "this issue has played a crucial role especially in the context of the so - called supernova paradigm for the origin of galactic cosmic rays .",
    "in fact , it was understood very soon , in the case of supernova remnants shocks , that acceleration would not be efficient enough and provide sufficiently high energies unless magnetic scattering could be self - generated by the particles themselves through their motion in the upstream plasma .",
    "the mechanism through which this generation of waves could occur was identified in the streaming instability ( @xcite ) and widely discussed later by @xcite . in these latter papers , in particular ,",
    "the maximum energy was estimated for shocks in supernova remnants , already believed to be candidate sources of galactic cosmic rays .",
    "the result of this investigation was however that the maximum energy , even in the presence of self - generated scattering agents , is of the order of @xmath1 gev , quite lower than the energy at which the knee is observed .",
    "today we know that this energy is also lower than the maximum energy observed in the proton component by the kascade experiment ( see @xcite for a comprehensive review of experimental results in the knee region ) that seems to be as high as @xmath2 gev ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "more recently the problem has been complicated even more by the understanding that particle acceleration can be rather efficient and break the _ test particle _ regime that old calculations were based upon .",
    "this important result was obtained independently within completely different approaches , two - fluid models ( @xcite ) , kinetic models ( @xcite ) and numerical approaches , using both monte carlo and other simulation procedures ( @xcite ) .",
    "the non - linear dynamical reaction of the accelerated particles introduces a positive reaction that results in a flattening of the high energy spectra , which are no longer power laws , thereby enhancing the role of particles at the highest energies .",
    "moreover a gradient in the velocity of the upstream fluid is produced by the pressure of the accelerated particles .",
    "the value of @xmath0 is important to determine the spectrum , and the spectrum determines the amplification of the magnetic field which in turn determines @xmath0 . the formalism of @xcite is not appropriate to describe this type of situation .    in this paper",
    "we describe the first calculation of the maximum momentum for cosmic ray modified shocks , including all the relevant non - linear effects .",
    "the description of the acceleration process , with the dynamical reaction of cosmic rays and the magnetic field amplification taken into account , is based on the recent papers by @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  [ sec : method ] we describe the method that allows us to compute the acceleration time as a function of the particle momentum ; in  [ sec : pmax ] we describe the procedure used to determine @xmath0 in the case of modified shocks and discuss the underlying assumptions ; in  [ sec : results ] we present the results we find for the maximum achievable momentum in supernova remnant shocks ; finally a critical discussion of the method adopted and a summary of the main results is provided in    [ sec : critical ] .",
    "the full description of the calculations that allow us to compute the spectrum of the accelerated particles , the dynamics of the upstream and downstream plasmas and the strength of the amplified magnetic field due to cosmic rays streaming instability in the stationary regime can be found in the papers by @xcite .    in this section",
    "we present the main achievement of our work , which consists of a derivation of the acceleration time @xmath3 ( as a function of the momentum @xmath4 ) for particles accelerated at a shock with an arbitrary level of shock modification .",
    "the expression we derive is a generalization of the well known formulae found in the context of quasi - linear theory ( @xcite ) and reduces to them when the non - linear shock modification is negligible .    in general ,",
    "the transport of the accelerated particles is described by the time dependent diffusion - convection equation : @xmath5 + \\frac{1}{3 } \\frac{du}{dx } p\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p } + q(x , p ) ,   \\label{eq : transport}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the distribution function of the accelerated particles , @xmath7 is the spatial diffusion coefficient and @xmath8 is the injection term , taken in the form @xmath9 , with the assumption that injection takes place only at the shock surface on the downstream side ( although this assumption is not strictly needed ) .",
    "the @xmath10axis goes from upstream infinity ( @xmath11 ) to downstream infinity ( @xmath12 ) and the shock is at @xmath13 .",
    "we will use the index @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) to refer to the region immediately upstream ( downstream ) of the shock .",
    "the problem of determining the time scale associated with the change of the distribution function around the maximum momentum is impossible to face analytically in all its complexity , as implied by the non - linearity of the system : in general , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 all depend on time , and change on comparable time scales .",
    "moreover , @xmath16 depends in a complicated way on all other quantities ( @xcite ) .",
    "let us assume that we know an approximation of the solution @xmath16 in the form of a solution of the stationary problem for a given value of the maximum momentum @xmath0 , as can be calculated following @xcite .",
    "this value of @xmath0 can be considered as a _ guess _ value to start with . in this case",
    "the velocity profile @xmath19 can be considered as determined in first instance from the guess function @xmath16 as derived by the assumption of quasi - stationarity , using the calculations of @xcite . within this approximate framework",
    ", we can introduce the laplace transform of the distribution function with respect to time : @xmath20 so that the transport equation becomes : @xmath21 + \\frac{1}{3 } \\frac{du}{dx } p\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial p } + \\frac{1}{s } q(x , p ) ,   \\label{eq : transportlaplace}\\ ] ]    integration of eq .",
    "[ eq : transportlaplace ] in the vicinity of the shock ( namely between @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) leads to the following boundary condition at the shock : @xmath24_2 - \\left[d\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}\\right]_1   + \\frac{1}{3 } ( u_2-u_1 ) p \\frac{\\partial g_0(s , p)}{\\partial p } +   \\frac{1}{s } q_0(p ) = 0 , \\label{eq : jump}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 , @xmath26 and we have used the continuity of the distribution function ( at any time ) at the shock .    we can find another condition on the distribution function by integrating the transport equation ( eq .

    "the agreement was found to be worse when the shock is quasi - linear , namely for small modifications .",
    "the reason for this is in the fact that eq .",
    "[ eq : approx ] satisfies the jump condition in the stationary regime ( @xmath49 ) only when @xmath50 . a better approximation for @xmath42",
    "is in fact of the form , @xmath51 @xmath46   \\int_0^x dx'\\frac{1}{d(x',p ) } \\int_{-\\infty}^{x ' } dx '' g(x '' )   \\label{eq : approx1}\\ ] ] which satisfies the jump condition exactly .",

    "[ eq : approx1 ] differs from eq .",

    "[ eq : lagage ] is correct within a factor of order unity .",
    "in general the value of @xmath0 is determined by the competition between the acceleration time and the shortest among the finite age of the source , the time scale for energy losses , and the time scale for escape of particles with momentum @xmath0 from upstream infinity .",
    "here we concentrate on the self - consistent calculation of the maximum momentum in those cases when it is determined by the finite age of the source ( this is expected to be the case for supernova remnants ) .",
    "in such a context each value of @xmath0 therefore reflects a different age @xmath78 of the system . in this sense ,",
    "our previous work ( @xcite ) was based on the implicit assumption that a quasi - stationary regime could be reached on time scales shorter than @xmath78 , but no specific recipe for the calculation of @xmath0 was adopted . in other work on non - linear diffusive particle acceleration at shock waves ,",
    "@xmath0 was either fixed or determined according with a simple recipe based on test - particle theory .",
    "our determination of the maximum momentum proceeds through 2 different steps : 1 ) we first determine the acceleration time @xmath3 ( eq . [ eq : tacc ] ) for a given value of @xmath79 ( at the first step this is just a guess value @xmath80 ) ; 2 ) we compare @xmath81 with the age of the system @xmath78 and determine an updated value of @xmath0 , say @xmath82 .",
    "the procedure is iterated until @xmath83 , where @xmath0 is now the actual maximum momentum for our problem .",
    "it is crucial to keep in mind that due to the non - linearity of the system , changing @xmath0 causes the all system to change ( velocity profile , spectrum of accelerated particles , efficiency of particle acceleration and also the diffusion coefficient , if the scattering is due to self - generated waves ) .",
    "the results obtained by applying this procedure are illustrated in the next section .",
    "following the method outlined in   [ sec : method ] we computed the acceleration time as a function of the particle momentum @xmath4 for a system with @xmath84 , under different assumptions on the shock mach number at infinity @xmath85 and on the diffusion properties of the system .",
    "the results of these calculations are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : tacc ] . we assumed a velocity of the shock wave of @xmath86 and considered values of @xmath85 ranging from @xmath87 ( unmodified shocks ) to @xmath88 ( already in the asymptotic regime for strongly modified shocks ) .",
    "the injection momentum was taken to be @xmath89 with @xmath90 corresponding to the maxwellian temperature @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "we also related the injection efficiency @xmath93 to the compression ratio at the subshock through the recipe proposed by @xcite and already adopted by @xcite . in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : tacc ] we plot the acceleration time up to a momentum @xmath4 for @xmath94 , namely with self - generated scattering , with @xmath95 the result of quasi - linear theory for scattering induced by self - generated alfvn waves . here",
    "@xmath96 and @xmath97 are the particle velocity and larmor radius ( in the background field @xmath98 ) respectively , and @xmath99 is the dimensionless wave energy density per unit logarithmic band - width ( see e.g. @xcite for details ) . in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : tacc ] we show the acceleration time for @xmath100 , with @xmath101 referring to bohm - like diffusion in the amplified magnetic field @xmath102 found by integrating @xmath103 in @xmath104-space : @xmath105 . in all of our calculations",
    "the background magnetic field was taken to be @xmath106 .",
    "the maximum momentum obtained from our iterative procedure is seen as the intersection with the horizontal line @xmath107 years , assumed to be the age of the system .",
    "each of the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : tacc ] was obtained by following the procedure outlined in   [ sec : pmax].the first thing to notice by comparing the two different panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : tacc ] is that the maximum achievable momentum , for a given mach number , is roughly the same ( within a factor of a few ( 2 - 4 ) at most ) for the two diffusion models adopted .",
    "this observation is very important given the fact that the diffusion coefficient is basically unknown and not easily obtained from observations .",
    "still the comparison between the two panels allows to highlight what the main effect of the different diffusion models is : in the case of strongly modified shocks the spectra become very flat at high energies as discussed in detail elsewhere ( e.g. @xcite ) and most of the power of the alfvn waves excited by the streaming cosmic rays is deposited in long wavelength waves ( the ones that are resonant with high energy particles ) , with a relatively smaller fraction going into waves that are able to efficiently scatter the low energy particles .",
    "this is the reason for the behaviour of @xmath3 observed in the upper panel , which may seem surprising at first sight for the flatness of the curves referring to @xmath108 . by comparing the two panels ,",
    "it is clear that things change drastically , with the dependence of @xmath109 on @xmath4 becoming much stronger , if the energy of the waves is redistributed uniformly between different wavelengths , which is what one is effectively assuming by adopting a bohm - like diffusion coefficient in the amplified magnetic field .",
    "finally , let us discuss the behaviour of the maximum achievable momentum as a function of the mach number .",
    "this is qualitatively the same for both models of diffusion : @xmath0 initially increases quickly with the mach number as a result of field amplification in modified shocks and then decreases somewhat , although slowly , when @xmath85 is further increased .",
    "this latter fact is clearly related to the more strongly modified velocity profile that leads to lower and lower values of the flow velocity in the vicinity of the shock and as a consequence increasingly longer residence times upstream .",
    "the dependence of the maximum achievable momentum on the shock mach number is illustrated more clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmax ] , where we plot @xmath0 as a function of @xmath85 for four different models of diffusion .",
    "the plot refers again to a system with @xmath110 and all other values of the relevant parameters are the same as above , including the background magnetic field strength and the recipe for @xmath68 .",
    "the solid curve refers to @xmath111 as described above , the dashed curve is for @xmath112 , the dotted curve is for @xmath113 ( namely the diffusion coefficient equals the bohm diffusion calculated in the amplified magnetic field at the shock surface , without spatial variation ) and finally the dot - dashed curve refers to bohm diffusion in the background magnetic field .",
    "the first aspect that clearly appears from the figure is the enhancement of @xmath0 that arises from magnetic field amplification . for high mach number shocks the magnetic field strength at the shock",
    "is amplified by a factor of order 25 and this implies an enhancement by a factor 10 - 30 ( depending on the diffusion model adopted ) of the maximum achievable energy ( comparison of the solid , dashed or dotted curves with the dot - dashed one ) . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath0 does not strongly depend on the detailed diffusion model adopted , in terms of the turbulence spectrum , with the difference between bohm diffusion and resonant scattering with self - generated alfvn turbulence ( comparison between the solid and dashed curves ) being a factor of 2 at most .",
    "a few remarks are worth being made .",
    "note that the values of the parameters adopted throughout our calculations are reminiscent of those appropriate to the case of young supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "this is because we wished to address here the issue of the maximum energy that can be achieved in this class of sources , as candidate sources of galactic cosmic rays .",
    "moreover there seems to be now solid evidence for amplified magnetic fields in snrs ( @xcite ) , so that there is observational support for the idea that cosmic rays might be efficiently accelerated at snrs shocks .",
    "the shock modification is a natural consequence of the effectiveness of these shocks as cosmic ray accelerators .",
    "the maximum energy that the accelerated particles can achieve in the context of modified shocks is always less than one would naively guess by using a @xcite type of estimate with the upstream velocity set equal to @xmath114 and the magnetic field evaluated at the shock surface .",
    "this is due to the combination of two effects .",
    "on one side , the net effect of the shock modification is to slow down the upstream fluid ( precursor ) , so that the effective velocity _ felt _ by the particles of given momentum is always lower than @xmath114 , thereby making the acceleration process slower .",
    "this is illustrated effectively through the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmax ] , where the diffusion coefficient is taken as bohm - like calculated with the magnetic field at the shock , assumed constant in the precursor . in this case",
    "the value of @xmath0 is always lower than @xmath115 gev / c for mach number @xmath116 , while in the absence of shock modification one would get @xmath117 gev / c .",
    "this factor @xmath118 is solely due to the existence of a precursor .",
    "there is however a second ( less important ) effect that causes a further decrease of @xmath0 : the spatial distribution of the accelerated particles in the precursor also determines a spatial profile of the strength of the magnetic field associated with the self - generated alfvn waves , so that the effective diffusion coefficient is also larger than @xmath119 .",
    "this effect is visible when comparing the dashed line with the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmax ] . the combination of the two effects leads to an overall decrease of @xmath0 by a factor @xmath120 compared with the naive expectation _ a la _ @xcite , more evident for higher values of the mach number .",
    "in this section we summarize the reasons for the need of the type of calculations presented here and we discuss some shortcomings of the proposed mathematical approach .    to our knowledge",
    "this represents the first attempt to determine the maximum momentum of the particles accelerated at a cosmic ray modified shock , where the nonlinear dynamical reaction of the accelerated particles changes the shocked fluid , the particles self - generate their own scattering centers , and the modified system in turn determines the spectral shape and energy content of the accelerated particles distribution .",
    "the creation of a shock precursor in the upstream region and the amplification of the background magnetic field through streaming instability are the main reasons to expect that the maximum achievable momentum may be appreciably different from the one calculated in linear theory for the same value of the shock mach number .",
    "the precursor , due to the gradual slowing down of the upstream plasma would by itself be expected to slightly decrease the maximum momentum : this effect can in fact be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmax ] , where the dash - dotted line shows the maximum momentum as a function of the mach number when the background field is not amplified . the reduced velocity in the upstream plasma slows down the process of return to the shock for the particles in the upstream section of the fluid . in the presence of magnetic field amplification",
    "the maximum momentum is expected to increase .",
    "this trend continues up to mach numbers for which the pressure in the form of accelerated particles can not increase any more ( saturation ) , so that the self - generated magnetic field also saturates . on the other hand the compression factor ( shock modification ) keeps increasing , so that the corresponding @xmath0 in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmax ] shows a slightly decreasing trend ( roughly the same that one obtains in the presence of shock modification but without field amplification , dash - dotted line ) .",
    "one should be careful not to mistake this trend for a temporal trend .",
    "the behaviour of the maximum momentum is to be interpreted only as a trend as a function of the fluid mach number at upstream infinity . in a more realistic situation the mach number",
    "can also change with time , which might introduce additional effects , not taken into account here . on the other hand ,",
    "if the conclusions of @xcite remain valid for this more complex scenario , one should expect that most of the acceleration of cosmic rays occurs between the end of the free expansion phase and the beginning of the sedov phase .",
    "this is the phase we concentrated our attention upon , so that the assumption of temporally constant mach number adopted here is justified .",
    "the most important equation derived in this work is eq .",
    "[ eq : tacc ] for the acceleration time in the presence of shock modification .",
    "it is important to realize that although the calculations shown here have been carried out by adopting the theory of @xcite for the evaluation of the modification and field amplification , eq .",
    "[ eq : tacc ] can be applied in a very general way .",
    "in fact all the quantities involved in the evaluation of eq .",
    "[ eq : tacc ] can be determined using very different approaches , for instance monte carlo simulations , while eq .",
    "[ eq : tacc ] can be adopted to estimate the _ instantaneous _ value of @xmath0 . moreover , since eq .",
    "[ eq : tacc ] directly contains the diffusion coefficients and the dynamical quantities ( e.g. fluid velocity ) , it can be applied independently of the specific mechanism of wave production . if the non - resonant wave generation mechanism recently proposed by @xcite were to be responsible for the wave production and particle scattering , this would change the mathematical form of the diffusion coefficient , and possibly the dynamical reaction of the plasma ( if the amplified field reaches a dynamically important value ) , but eq .",
    "[ eq : tacc ] could still be applied unchanged .",
    "the most relevant shortcoming of the calculation illustrated here is in the fact that we used the assumption of quasi - stationarity in the upstream fluid ( not downstream ) .",
    "this assumption is fundamental to allow us to apply the method of laplace transform , which can be used only for linear differential equations . at the same time",
    "quasi - stationarity is also required in order to use our previous calculations ( @xcite ) for the shock modification and field amplification .",
    "these are actually two different aspects of the same problem of this approach , which however can not be avoided if an analytical attempt has to be made to calculate the maximum momentum in these complex situations .",
    "it should however be stressed that the shortcomings just discussed also apply to the approach of @xcite : their calculations are only valid for linear shocks ( @xmath121 ) so that the velocity and density profiles at the shock are spatially constant and given .",
    "on the other hand the diffusion coefficient , which is self - generated in their approach , is time - dependent because the particle distribution function is time - dependent . despite this",
    ", the authors fix the diffusion coefficient ( and the distribution function of the accelerated particles ) and proceed by applying the method of the laplace transform . in this sense",
    "our approach should be considered as the extension of the work of @xcite to the case in which the dynamical reaction of the accelerated particles is not neglected .",
    "the common finding of several independent approaches to particle acceleration at shocks is that shock modification manifests itself in a prominent way , as a consequence of efficient acceleration , therefore our extension seems particularly important at this time .",
