    "the asymptotic cones of a finitely generated group @xmath1 are metric spaces introduced by m.  gromov in his seminal paper on groups with polynomial growth @xcite .",

    "a group usually has several asymptotic cones ( depending on the choice of rescaling parameters or ultra - filter ) .",

    "this implies in particular that every _",
    "finitely presented _ lacunary hyperbolic group is actually hyperbolic .",
    "however the class of lacunary hyperbolic groups is much larger : it is an uncountable family of finitely generated groups which are quite diverse and contains some rather exotic infinite groups .",
    "it contains some infinite torsion groups , some non - abelian groups whose proper subgroups are all cyclic , some elementary amenable groups having at least two non - homeomorphic asymptotic cones , and many groups that served as counterexamples to various questions .    in this paper",
    "we study endomorphisms and automorphisms of lacunary hyperbolic groups .",
    "although the class of lacunary hyperbolic groups is very large and wild , we manage to bring to light some general properties of their outer automorphism groups .",
    "if @xmath1 is a hyperbolic group such that @xmath7 is infinite , then the bestvina - paulin construction provides a non - trivial action of @xmath1 on an @xmath8-tree @xcite .",
    "conversely , this says that if a hyperbolic group @xmath1 has property @xmath9 ( i.e. every action of @xmath1 on an @xmath8-tree has a fixed point ) , then @xmath7 is finite .",
    "this does not hold for general lacunary hyperbolic groups ( see below ) . however , the following result is reminiscent from this fact .",

    "on the other hand , @xmath7 need not be finite .",
    "moreover , there is no restriction on the possible isomorphism type of locally finite groups occurring in @xmath7 ( with the only obvious restriction that it should be countable ) :    let @xmath10 be a countable , locally finite group .",
    "then there exists a lacunary hyperbolic group @xmath1 with property @xmath9 , such that @xmath7 is locally finite and contains a subgroup isomorphic to @xmath10 .",

    ".    in particular , if @xmath10 is infinite , then @xmath7 is not finitely generated .",
    "the group @xmath1 is constructed using iterated small cancellation in hyperbolic groups , where at each step one ensures that the obtained quotient has more and more automorphisms according to @xmath10 .    in general",
    ", we exhibit a stratification of @xmath7 related to the fact that @xmath1 is a controlled direct limit of hyperbolic groups ( ) .",
    "this has some consequences on the collection of stretching factors of automorphisms of @xmath1 . fix a finite generating set @xmath12 of @xmath1 , and @xmath13 the corresponding word metric . define the _ norm _ or _ stretching factor",

    "we prove that if @xmath1 has property @xmath9  and is approximated sufficiently fast by hyperbolic groups then there are large gaps in the spectrum @xmath21 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath22 for some @xmath23 with the notations above , then there is a sequence of large intervals @xmath24 in the complement of @xmath21 , with @xmath25 going to infinity , and whose lengths satisfy @xmath26 .",

    "see for more precise statements .",
    "unfortunately we are not able to describe the structure of the outer automorphism group of a lacunary hyperbolic group @xmath1 without property @xmath9 .",
