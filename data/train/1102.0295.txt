    "the ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation from space is absorbed by the earth atmosphere , thus requiring observations from space - borne observatories . at present , the only fully uv - dedicated space mission is the _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( _ galex _ ) , which has been observing the uv sky since 2003 . up to now , it has provided photometry of more than 200 million objects ( see bianchi , this volume ) , nevertheless its spectroscopic database is still almost completely unexploited . to our knowledge ,",
    "just very few works have been published which made use of _ galex _  spectra @xcite . in this work",
    ", we conduct a general analysis of the whole spectroscopic database aimed at identifying and characterizing the variety of observed stars , which could be later applied to studies of galactic and extragalactic stellar populations .",
    "in particular , we define suitable spectral tools to determine statistical properties of the stellar sample , through their main atmospheric parameters .",
    "_ galex _  is a nasa small explorer mission @xcite whose main goal is to carry out a two - band uv photometric all - sky survey . being equipped with a grism , it can also provide slitless spectroscopy of the entire field - of - view ( 1.2  deg ) in the far - uv ( fuv ; 13001820   ) and near - uv ( nuv ; 18203004   ) , at resolutions of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the _ galex _  general release 4/5 contains 174 spectroscopic tiles for a total observing time of about 2.5  msec .",
    "the database includes the spectra of more than 60000 objects . for extracting spectra ,",
    "we have used the automatic pipeline , which provides the wavelength calibrated and flux calibrated monodimensional spectra of the objects in each tile .",
    "a reliable flux calibration is undoubtedly a crucial point whenever colors are considered or large wavelength intervals are used to extract stellar atmospheric parameters .",
    "the _ galex",
    "_  flux calibration @xcite have been obtained from a series of observations of white dwarfs ( wd ) taken from the catalog of @xcite . to verify the robustness of this calibration ,",
    "we have compared the wds in the _",
    "galex_spectroscopic database which are in common with the study of @xcite , who provide a series of high quality iue spectra of galactic white dwarfs . in fig .",
    "[ fig : wd ] , we plot the uv spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of three objects ( gd  50 , lb  227 , and hz  21 ) that show that the best agreement between iue and _ galex _  data is achieved in the nuv interval , while the _ galex _  fuv range presents severe flux calibration problems , which consist in a overall underestimation of flux and the appearance of spurious features .",
    "we therefore limited our present study to nuv wavelengths between 2000 and 2830   , as , outside this interval , the _ galex _  nuv detector sensitivity decreases drastically .",
    "we would like to mention , however , that the `` blue '' ( i.e. , short - wavelength ) edge of _ galex _  sensitivity in the nuv drops at shorter wavelengths than iue , allowing a better spectral morphological analysis over the spectral window 20002300   .",
    "each spectroscopic tile has also been observed in imaging mode , so that it is possible to assign each spectrum to its corresponding source in the nuv image .",
    "we made use , for each of the 174 spectroscopic tiles , of the data present in the photometric catalog file ( * -xd - mcat.fits ) and the spectra provided by the _",
    "galex _  automatic pipeline ( * -xg - gsp.fits ) . since the goal of this work is to assess the potential of _ galex _  data to determine the main properties of stars , we extracted point - like objects from the entire database by means of the following criteria :    * ellipticity@xmath40.2 in the nuv image ; * ( sextractor parameter ) class_star@xmath50.8 , in the nuv image , and * a median snr / px@xmath55 in the nuv spectral interval .",
    "this criterion by itself decreases the number of spectra to about 11000 .",
    "the selected analysis sample is formed by a total of 6037 spectra .",
    "the adopted selection criteria do not exclude the presence in the sample of other kind of sources , besides stars .",
    "therefore , in order to have an indication on the amount of contamination , we proceeded to cross - correlate the position of all sources in our sample with the simbad database .",
    "we found a total of 2132 objects , which is about 35% of our total sample .",
    "they include 235 entries , which are classified as non - stellar ( qsos , galaxies , and so on ) , and 118 objects which are only identified as being sources emitting in uv , x , ir , submm , etc .",
    "we concluded that the expected fraction of contamination from non - stellar ( or unclassified ) objects of our sample should be around 16% , which imply a total number of stars of about 5000 .",
    "the distribution of the spectral types of the stars present in our sample is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : histosimbad ] : the peak corresponds to f and g types , with a significant contribution of a and k type stars . in an effective temperature scale , this translates to roughly the interval 400010000  k. in this plot we incorporate those stellar objects that have a spectral classification in simbad .",
    "the fraction of white dwarfs with respect of all other stars can be biased from the fact that they were selected for calibration purposes .",
    "examples of high snr _ galex _  stellar spectra along the spectral type sequence are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] .    the apparent v magnitude distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : histomag ] ) of the simbad sample is highly peaked at around 911  mag .",

    "recently , @xcite have studied the mid - uv spectral morphology of stars and evolved stellar populations by means of the @xcite set of indices computed in iue observations .    for the analysis of our sample",
    ", we used a set of 9 spectrophotometric indices carefully defined to be suitable for the _",
    "galex_spectral resolution and to maximize the sensitivity to stellar parameter variations .",
    "since the indices mainly depend on the strength of absorption features , they are most suitable for late - type stars , while they decrease their effectiveness for hot o  b stars .        the index i d and passbands are reported in table  [ tab : def ] and shown in fig .",

    "we have adopted the definition given by eq .  5 in @xcite .",
    "in this definition the flux in the index band is compared to a pseudo - continuum , obtained by the interpolation of the fluxes in the two side bands ; the other 4 indices are narrow - band colors , which measure the difference in magnitude between the blue and red band .",
    "note that , due to the red edge cut - off sensitivity , it was not possible to define a suitable red band for the indices measuring the strength of the mg  ii doublet at 2800    and the blend around 2730   : we have therefore defined two colors , where the blue and red bands are inverted ; in this way , the indices have increasing values with increasing line absorption .",

    "system , apart from gbl2730 , which merges together the two iue absorption blends at 2720 and 2740    due to the lower _ galex _  spectral resolution .",
