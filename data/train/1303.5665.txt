    "it is well  known that the spatial fluctuations of the eigenstates in a disordered system at the anderson  transition show multifractal characteristics@xcite which has been demonstrated recently in a series of experiments.@xcite therefore the modeling and analysis of multifractal states has become of central importance producing many interesting results . for this purpose",
    "random matrix models have been invoked and studied recently.@xcite    since the exact , analytical prediction of the multifractal dimensions of the states for the experimentally relevant anderson  transition in @xmath10 or the integer quantum  hall transition in @xmath11 seems to be out of reach , it is desirable to search for heuristic relations in order to understand the complexity of the states at criticality . in the present paper",
    "we propose such heuristic relations that are numerically verified using various ensembles of random matrices .",
    "moreover , we will demonstrate the robustness of these findings by extending to many different observables .",
    "these relations could play an important role in testing analytical predictions and could also be tested using the experiments mentioned above .",
    "the spatial fluctuations of the eigenstates can be described by a set of multifractal dimensions @xmath0 defined by the scaling of the inverse mean eigenfunction participation numbers as a function of system size @xmath6 : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the average over some eigenvalue window and over random realizations of the matrix . for strongly localized eigenstates",
    "these quantities do not scale with system size , i.e. @xmath14 for all @xmath9 , while extended states always feel the entire system , i.e. @xmath15 , for all @xmath9 .",
    "multifractal states , on the other hand , should be described by the series of the @xmath0 , which are a nonlinear function of the parameter @xmath9 .",
    "one of the most important generalized dimensions often used in this context is the information dimension @xmath16 .",
    "it is defined through the scaling of the mean eigenfunction entropy with the logarithm of the system size : @xmath17 a further , well  known and widely used dimension is called the correlation dimension @xmath18 , which is extracted from the inverse participation number from eq .",

    "( [ correl ] ) the energy scale @xmath26 is of the order of the bandwidth.@xcite    besides the wave functions the spectra also show anomalous properties .",

    "the spectral fluctuations in a metallic system with extended states yield a vanishing compressibility , @xmath31 , while in a strongly disordered insulating system the levels are uncorrelated , hence they are easily compressible , @xmath32 . however , for the multifractal states an intermediate statistics exists , @xmath33 , furthermore the spectral and eigenstate statistics are supposed to be coupled , which has been pointed out first in ref .",

    "( [ chid1 ] ) and ( [ chid2 ] ) it seems evident that there may exist further relations between generalized dimensions and the level compressibility , moreover , one may conjecture that the generalized dimensions of the multifractal spectrum must be also intimately linked together .    in the present work",
