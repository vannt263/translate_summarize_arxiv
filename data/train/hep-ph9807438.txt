    "the problem lies with failing to account adequately for the contribution to the dse loop integral from the ultraviolet part of the gluon propagator .",
    "in essence , this means that in the euclidean formalism , the momentum of an intermediate quark state can not be assumed to be aligned closely with that of the external quark line in the heavy quark limit .",
    "we have solved this problem by adding to the integrand of the dse a function which integrates to zero over angles in euclidean space , but which cancels off higher order in @xmath41 contributions to the integrand that would otherwise contribute to the zeroth order quark self energy .",
    "we note that the analogous function in minkowski space , when integrated over the two sheeted hyperboloid defined by a constant value for @xmath96 , is a strongly divergent integral , suggesting that our procedure is unique to the euclidean formalism .",
    "in fact , if such a procedure proved to be necessary and valid in minkowski space , it would bring into question the notion that backward propagating intermediate states can be ignored in the heavy quark limit .",
    "in the absence of a viable nonperturbative treatment of quantum chromodynamics directly formulated in minkowski space , it is difficult to place a physical interpretation on a procedure which appears to be simply a necessary mathematical step within the euclidean formalism .",
    "the practical effect of the correction is to shift conjugate propagator poles present in our previous solution deeper into the complex momentum plane , and further from the real , timelike axis .",
    "our solution for the heavy quark propagator can be regarded as the first step in determining the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) amplitude for @xmath97-@xmath98 mesons . in reference",
    "@xcite it was found that , if a simple gaussian gluon propagator which does not accurately model the ultraviolet gluon behaviour is used , the pole in the heavy quark propagator is only slightly shifted from its bare propagator position at @xmath30 .",
    "it was further shown that the presence of this pole prevented solutions to the ladder approximation @xmath97-@xmath98 bs equation .",
    "the removal of propagator poles to remote parts of the complex plane exhibited by our corrected solutions should overcome this difficulty .",

    "the bound state @xmath97-@xmath98 bs amplitude was modelled using a variety of gaussian - like functional forms , each using a single fitted scale parameter .",
