    "individuals exposed to the virus who become infectious do so after a mean incubation period of @xmath9 days ( @xmath10 days ) @xcite .",

    "individuals are assumed to be in one of the following epidemiological states ( figure [ myfig0 ] ) : susceptibles ( at risk of contracting the disease ) , exposed ( infected but not yet infectious ) , infectives ( capable of transmitting the disease ) , and removed ( those who recover or die from the disease ) .",
    "susceptible individuals in class @xmath13 in contact with the virus enter the exposed class @xmath14 at the per - capita rate @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is transmission rate per person per day , @xmath17 is the total effective population size , and @xmath18 is the probability that a contact is made with a infectious individual ( i.e. uniform mixing is assumed ) . exposed individuals undergo an average incubation period ( assumed asymptomatic and uninfectious ) of @xmath19 days before progressing to the infectious class @xmath20 .",

    "these estimates are an upper bound of the effective population size ( those at risk of becoming infected ) for each region .",

    "in fact , comparisons between the pseudo mass - action and the true mass - action assumptions with experimental data have concluded in favor of the later @xcite .",

    "we give the median of @xmath3 ( not the mean ) as the resulting distribution of @xmath3 from our uncertainty analysis is skewed to the right .",

    "our estimate for the infectious period for the case of congo ( @xmath133 days ) is slightly larger than that of uganda ( @xmath134 days ) .",
    "clearly , a larger infectious period increases the likelihood of infecting a susceptible individual and hence increases the basic reproductive number .",
    "the difference in the infectious periods might be due to differences in virus subtypes @xcite .",
    "the congo outbreak was caused by the ebola - zaire virus subtype @xcite while the uganda outbreak was caused by the ebola - sudan virus subtype @xcite .",
    "+ the significant reduction from the basic reproductive number ( @xmath3 ) to the post - intervention reproductive number ( @xmath120 ) in our estimates for congo and uganda shows that the implementation of control measures such as education , contact tracing and quarantine will have a significant effect on lowering the effective reproductive rate of ebola .",

    "+ we have explored the sensitivity of the final epidemic size to the starting time of interventions .",
    "the exponential increase of the final epidemic size with the time of start of interventions ( figure [ figsensinterv ] ) supports the idea that the rapid implementation of control measures should be considered as a critical component in any contingency plan against disease outbreaks specially for those like ebola and sars for which no specific treatment or vaccine exists . a two - week delay in implementing public health measures results in an approximated doubling of the final outbreak size .",
    "because the existing control measures cut the transmission rate to less than half , we should seek and support further improvement in the effectiveness of interventions for ebola . a mathematical model that considers basic public health interventions for sars control in toronto supports this conclusion @xcite .",
    "moreover , computer simulations show that small perturbations to the rate @xmath44 at which interventions are put fully in place do not have a significant effect on the final epidemic size .",
    "the rapid identification of an outbreak , of course , remains the strongest determinant of the final outbreak size .",
    "+ field studies of ebola virus are difficult to conduct due to the high risk imposed on the scientific and medical personnel @xcite .",
    "recently , a new vaccine that makes use of an _ adenovirus technology _ has been shown to give cynomolgus macaques protection within @xmath135 weeks of a single jab @xcite .",
    "if the vaccine turns out to be effective in humans , then its value should be tested .",
    "a key question would be `` what are the conditions for a successful target vaccination campaign during an ebola outbreak ? '' to address questions of this type elaborate models need to be developed .",
