    "present cosmological observations point to the need for a revolution in our physical understanding . on one hand we have a very successful phenomenological description of the universe based on the spatially homogeneous and isotropic friedmann",
    " lematre  robertson  walker ( flrw ) geometry .",
    "however , this success comes at the price of the introduction of forms of mass  energy that have never been directly observed , and which constitute most of the stuff in the universe : 27% in the form of clumped nonbaryonic dark matter , and 68% in the form of a smooth dark energy @xcite .",
    "unknowns of this magnitude demand that we carefully re - examine the assumptions of our physical models of the universe , and that we pay careful attention to all observations .",
    "the universe was certainly homogeneous to a high degree at the epoch of last scattering , when the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation was laid down .",
    "however , at the present epoch the matter distribution displays a complex hierarchical structure with significant inhomogeneities up to scales of at least @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the dimensionless parameter related to the hubble constant by @xmath3 .",
    "the present universe is dominated in volume by voids , with some 40% of the volume in voids of a characteristic diameter @xmath4 @xcite@xcite and populations of smaller minivoids @xcite .",
    "galaxy clusters are grouped in sheets that surround the voids , and filaments thread them , in a complex cosmic web @xcite .    a cosmological constant , @xmath5 , as a source of dark energy might in itself not pose a great theoretical puzzle ,",
    "were it not for the _ cosmic coincidence problem _ : why is the value of @xmath5 such that the universe decelerates for much of its history and only begins to accelerate relatively recently ?",
    "in addition , there is another cosmic coincidence , which some cosmologists view as a smoking gun : the onset of cosmic acceleration also coincides with the epoch in which the large nonlinear structures of the cosmic web begin to dominate , as the map of the time history of universe @xcite clearly reveals .    the possibility that the phenomenon of dark energy is actually accounting for the average effects of inhomogeneous structures on the expansion history of the universe has led to an upsurge of interest in the averaging problem in cosmology .",
    "this is a foundational question since the physical ingredients of einstein s theory have never been precisely specified on all scales .",
    "there are many unsolved problems relating to the coarse - graining , fitting , and averaging of geometry . in these lectures",
    "i will discuss these issues , with an emphasis on the cosmology , which does at least provide a phenomenologically viable alternative to the standard model . in the  scenario ,",
    "i have attempted to address the key issue of gravitational energy which i believe is intimately related to solving the riddle of `` dark energy '' .",
    "it is my hope that if we pay close attention to observations , and think more deeply about fundamental concepts in light of new observations , that we might develop better statistical notions of gravitational energy and entropy , which may be important not only for cosmology at large but also for the foundations of gravitational physics .",
    "in the standard flrw cosmology , fundamental observers are defined to be `` comoving with the dust '' in geometries that are solutions to einstein equations with a dust or perfect fluid source .",
    "this poses two problems .",
    "firstly , it involves an extrapolation of einstein s field equations _",
    "= 8gc^4t^_[efe ] far beyond the scales on which they have been tested .",
    "general relativity is only well tested for isolated systems  such as the solar system or binary pulsars  for which @xmath6 .",
    "secondly , the notion of what a `` dust particle '' is in cosmology is not rigorously defined .",
    "the scale over which matter fields are coarse - grained to produce the energy ",
    "momentum tensor on the r.h.s .  of ( [ efe ] )",
    "is not prescribed , leaving an inherent ambiguity .",
    "traditionally , galaxies have been thought of as particles of dust .",
    "however , our observations show that galaxies themselves are not homogeneously distributed .",
    "the largest typical nonlinear structures are voids of diameter @xmath7 @xcite@xcite , so that we must coarse grain on scales at least a few times larger to obtain a notion of statistical homogeneity .",
    "this process of coarse - graining involves unexplored statistical aspects of general relativity , which have barely been studied .",
    "there is no ambiguity in applying einstein s equations ( [ efe ] ) to a fluid of particles with well - defined properties , such as ions , atoms and molecules in the early phases of the universe s expansion .",
    "however , as soon as gravitational collapse occurs then particle geodesics cross .",
    "phase transitions occur , so the definition of the particles in the fluid approximation must change , giving rise to the following hierarchy of coarse - grained ` particles ' in the epochs following last scattering :    1 .",
    "atomic , molecular , ionic or nuclear particles : applicable with * dust equation of state within any expanding regions which have not yet undergone gravitational collapse ; * fluid equation of state within relevant collapsed objects ( stars , white dwarfs , neutron stars ) for periods of time between phase transitions that alter the non - gravitational particle interactions and the equation of state ; 2",
    ".   collapsed objects such as stars and black holes coarse - grained as isolated objects ; 3 .",
    "stellar systems coarse - grained as dust particles within galaxies ; 4 .",
    "galaxies coarse - grained as dust particles within clusters ; 5 .",
    "clusters of galaxies coarse - grained as bound systems within expanding filaments and walls ; 6 .",
    "voids , walls and filaments combined as expanding regions of different densities in a single smoothed out cosmological fluid .",
    "any coarse - graining procedure amounts to replacing the microphysics of a given spacetime region by some collective degrees of freedom of those regions which are sufficient to describe physics on scales larger than the coarse - graining scale .",
    "einstein s equations were originally formulated with the intent that the energy - momentum tensor on the r.h.s .  of ( [ efe ] )",
    "should either describe fundamental fields , such as the maxwell field , or alternatively to the coarse - graining of the purely nongravitational interactions described by such fields in the fluid approximation .",
    "up to step 3 in the hierarchy , there are no real problems of principle with coarse - graining since we are coarse - graining only over matter degrees of freedom which appear exclusively in the energy - momentum tensor . in 1917 when einstein first applied general relativity to cosmology @xcite , this was sufficient since it had yet to be established that nebulae were distant galaxies , and the prevailing view was that the density of the universe was the density of the milky way .",
    "decades later einstein did consider the fitting problem , when he built the swiss cheese model in collaboration with straus @xcite .",
    "however , this is a simple model which treats inhomogeneities as schwarzschild solutions placed in holes in a homogeneous isotropic flrw background .",
    "it deals with an idealized situation which is far simpler than the actual cosmic web , which astronomers really only began to uncover in the 1980s .",
    "the fundamental problem then , is that since the universe is composed of a hierarchy of long - lived structures much larger than those of stars , we must also coarse - grain over the gravitational interactions within that hierarchy to arrive at a fluid description for cosmology .",
    "with such a coarse - graining , geometry no longer enters purely on the left hand side of einstein s equations but in a coarse - grained sense can be hidden inside effective fluid elements of a smoothed out energy - momentum tensor on the right hand side of ( [ efe ] ) .",
    "we have a complex hierarchical fitting problem @xcite that must be solved to relate the average geometry of the universe to the local geometry to which our clocks and rulers are calibrated .",
    "the fundamental quantities of interest as the sources of the right hand side of einstein s equations are those of mass  energy , momentum and angular momentum .",
    "effectively , if we demand that equations ( [ efe ] ) should also apply in a coarse - grained version on cosmological scales , then it means that we are seeking collective mass  energy parameters which average over the rotational kinetic energies of galaxies , binding energies of galaxies and clusters , kinetic energies of galaxies in virialized clusters , regional spatial curvature etc .",
    "furthermore we must approach the problem more than just once , on a succession of scales .",
    "this necessarily involves the issue of quasilocal gravitational energy , and more particularly statistical properties of the gravitational interactions of bound systems .",
    "since we are no longer dealing with a fixed spatial metric this problem is far more complicated than any equivalent problem in newtonian theory , and indeed it is largely unexplored territory .",
    "the physical degrees of freedom which we must coarse grain are contained in the curvature tensor and the sources of the field equations ( [ efe ] ) . in principle coarse - graining",
    "the curvature tensor might involve steps other than simply coarse - graining of the metric .",
    "however , if a metric description of gravity is assumed at each level , then schematically the hierarchy of coarse - graining might be heuristically described as .",
    "r +   +    } [ coarse]where the ellipsis denotes the fact that the metric of more than one type of wall or void might possibly be relevant . in this scheme",
    "the lowest members are assumed to be well modeled by exact solutions of einstein s field equations : @xmath8 being a solution to the vacuum field equations with a star or black hole source ( given by the schwarzschild or kerr solution ) , and @xmath9 being that of a region filled with low density ionic dust with whatever symmetries are relevant .    within the hierarchy ( [ coarse ] )",
    "there are ( at least ) three steps that involve the coarse - graining of gravitational degrees of freedom , which might be summarized as    * _ galactic dynamics _ : @xmath10 ; * _ cluster dynamics _ : @xmath11 ; * _ cosmological dynamics _ :",
    "@xmath12 .",
    "the gravitational degrees of freedom that are coarse - grained in galactic and cluster dynamics involve the gravitational binding energies of bound systems of different scales .",
    "by contrast cosmological dynamics deals with the coarse - graining of expanding regions of different densities , i.e. , with the coarse - graining of the kinetic energy of expansion of space .    in the newtonian cosmology @xcite for particles of mass @xmath13 with positions @xmath14 , ( @xmath15const ) ,",
    "relative to an arbitrary centre , the friedmann equation + kc^2a^2=8g3[f]is obtained from the newtonian energy equation , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the kinetic energy per particle , @xmath18 is the potential energy per particle and @xmath19 is the total energy per particle , where @xmath20 is a constant .",
    "( [ f ] ) , the hamiltonian constraint of the full einstein equations for the standard cosmology , is thus recognized to contain terms related to gravitational potential and binding energy , @xmath21 , and the kinetic energy of expansion , @xmath22 , in the newtonian limit .",
    "as long as the universe is perfectly homogeneous then these quantities are the same for all observers .",
    "however , once there is inhomogeneity , and in particular once there are gradients in spatial curvature , then these concepts become entangled . on account of the strong equivalence principle",
    ", spatial curvature can not be defined at a point , and any definition necessarily involves a regional _ quasilocal _ definition .",
    "gravitational binding energy and the kinetic energy of expansion are thus quasilocal concepts tied to gradients in spatial curvature .",
    "a statistical description of cosmological relativity involves both gravitational binding energy and the kinetic energy of expansion .",
    "it happens that the coarse - graining of these respective gravitational degrees of freedom relates to the scales at which the phenomena of dark matter and dark energy are respectively observed .",
    "it is therefore possible that both phenomena are related to different aspects of the same problem , namely that the standard model incorporates a rigidity of spatial curvature which is not demanded by full general relativity .",
    "since the coarse - graining of gravitational binding energy and the kinetic energy of expansion involve different physical questions , it may be prudent to investigate just one problem at a time .",
    "the  scenario @xcite@xcite has been developed to deal with the problem of the kinetic energy of expansion only : in the approach taken thus far all coarse - grained regions are expanding ones .",
    "we will see in sec .",
    "[ ts ] that agreement with observation is obtained only by incorporating a fraction of nonbaryonic dark matter .",
    "however , we must remain open - minded as to whether the parameter found corresponds to actual new particles as in the standard @xmath5 cold dark matter ( ) model , or whether is a simply a phenomenological parameter that accounts for the coarse - graining of binding energy that we have not yet examined .",
    "a piece of evidence in support of an alternative to conventional cdm is the remarkable phenomenological success of modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) @xcite at the level of galactic dynamics .",
    "this empirical model works well at galactic levels , but fails at the cluster level .",
    "while galactic and cluster dynamics both involve binding energy , the kinetic energy degrees of freedom of the two situations are different .",
    "galactic dynamics typically involves stars in rotationally supported structures , whereas cluster dynamics involves the less coherent motions of galaxies which move in the combined potential but also interact with each other in random pairwise encounters .",
    "whereas the diameters of stars are very small ( @xmath23% ) compared to their interparticle separations in galaxies , the typical size of a galaxy is a more sizable fraction ( @xmath24@xmath25% ) of typical intergalactic distances in a virialized cluster .",
    "newtonian dynamics is used almost exclusively in the treatment of both galaxy and cluster dynamics .",
    "the rationale for this is that fields are weak .",
    "however , even if spacetime is close to a minkowski background , an important question remains : _ which _ minkowski background ? there is no global minkowski background in the universe , and even if space is close to minkowski for small time intervals on a spatial 2-sphere encompassing a galaxy or galaxy cluster , then the question remains : how do we calibrate the rulers and clocks on that 2-sphere relative to another similar 2-sphere elsewhere ?",
    "gravitational lensing calculations make use of a formula derived for the ideal schwarzschild geometry of an isolated point mass , which has an exact timelike killing vector .",
    "are there pitfalls in applying such notions of mass to circumstances in which there are no pure timelike killing vectors , and no truly isolated masses ? to my knowledge , these questions have not been rigorously posed in general relativity , let alone answered .",
    "some attempts have been made to understand galaxy rotation curves with exact dust solutions @xcite@xcite .",
    "however , the applicability of these solutions as alternatives to galactic dark matter has been debated @xcite .",
    "furthermore , while new exact solutions to einstein s equations may offer new insights into the possibilities offered by general relativity , they do not directly address the problems posed by coarse - graining .",
    "they are also limited by the additional restrictions that must be applied to reduce einstein s equations to a soluble form .",
    "for example , although galaxy clusters are often spherical in shape the spherically symmetric dust lematre ",
    " bondi ( ltb ) solutions @xcite@xcite can not be applied to virialized clusters , since galaxies in clusters do not collapse inwards in coherent spherical shells .",
    "even if the motion of individual galaxies is close to radial , the phases of the galaxies relative to passage through the centre of the cluster are completely uncorrelated",
    ". individual galaxies will pass close to the core of the cluster and emerge from the other side ; but at any instant the number of galaxies moving out from the centre might be comparable to the number falling in .    in my view the problems of coarse - graining of galaxies and clusters are difficult .",
    "however , in view of the phenomenological successes of mond at the galactic scale @xcite we should be open to the possibility that simplifying principles remain to be discovered .",
    "the final step of coarse - graining involves qualitatively new fundamental questions . if we require a single model to describe the evolution of the universe from last scattering to the present day , then we must coarse grain on scales over which the notion of a dust ` particle ' has a meaning from last scattering up to the present .",
    "the description of a galaxy composed of stars , or of a virialized galaxy cluster composed of galaxies is only valid for those epochs after which the relevant ` particles ' have formed and are themselves relatively unchanging .",
    "over cosmological timescales we do not have well - defined invariant dust particles .",
    "the nature of galaxies and galaxy clusters changes through growth by accretion of gas and by mergers .    to get around the problem of ill - defined particle - like building blocks ,",
    "an appropriate strategy is to coarse - grain the ` dust ' on scales large enough that the _ average _ flow of mass from one cell to another is negligible up to the present epoch .",
    "although galaxy clusters vary greatly in size and complexity , there are no common virialized structures larger than clusters .",
    "thus coarse - graining on scales larger than clusters necessarily means dealing with fundamental objects that are themselves _ expanding _ ,",
    "i.e. , with entities that resemble _ fluid elements _ in hydrodynamics rather than point particles .",
    "another qualitative difference from the case of bound systems is that we have to deal with expanding fluid elements that have vastly different densities at the present epoch , and which evolve more or less independently .",
    "although we can receive signals from anywhere within our particle horizon , the energy we receive in electromagnetic and gravitational waves , or indeed in cosmic ray particles from distant galaxies , is negligible in comparison with the rest - energy of the local density field .",
    "the region which has contributed matter particles to define the local geometry of our own galaxy is actually very small .",
    "this bounding sphere , which ellis and stoeger @xcite call the _ matter horizon _ , is estimated by them to be of order @xmath26mpc for the milky way using assumptions about the growth of perturbations from the standard cosmology .",
    "this scale also coincides roughly with the scale at which the hubble flow is believed to begin in the immediate neighbourhood of the local group of galaxies .",
    "it is one way of realizing the concept of _ finite infinity _ , introduced qualitatively by ellis in his first discussion of the fitting problem @xcite .    for galaxy clusters some sort of finite infinity notion  which we will better define in sec .",
    "[ ts ]  with a variable scale of order @xmath27@xmath28mpc depending on the size of cluster might be useful for defining the minimum smoothing scale containing bound structures . by combining such regions we arrive at the walls and filaments that contain most of the mass of the universe .",
    "however , to this we must also add the voids which dominate the volume of the universe at the present epoch .",
    "these are the regions in which structures have never formed , and which still contain the same ionic , atomic and molecular dust content that has existed since very early epochs , only greatly diluted by expansion .    if we set aside a few peculiar large wall structures @xcite , then the largest _ typical _ nonlinear structures are voids .",
    "surveys indicate that voids with characteristic mean effective radii of order @xmath29 ( or diameters of order @xmath7 ) , and a typical density contrast of @xmath30 , make up 40% of the volume of the nearby universe @xcite . a recent study @xcite of the sloan digital sky survey data release 7 finds a median effective void radius of @xmath31 , with voids of effective radii in the range @xmath32 to @xmath7 occupying 62% of the survey volume .",
    "in addition to these there are numerous smaller minivoids @xcite , which combined with the dominant voids ensure that voids dominate the present epoch universe by volume .",
    "any minimal scale for the cosmological coarse - graining of the final smoothed density distribution has to be substantially larger than the diameter of the largest typical structures .",
    "void statistics @xcite indicate an effective cutoff of @xmath33 for the largest mean effective diameters of voids , i.e. , twice the scale of the typical dominant void diameters .",
    "thus observationally , the relevant scale for coarse - graining appears to be of order two to three times the dominant void diameter , e.g. , of order @xmath1 .",
    "although the scale of transition to statistical homogeneity is debated @xcite recent results from the wigglez survey suggest that the transition occurs in the range . ]",
    "@xmath34@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "a statistical homogeneity scale of @xmath35 also coincides roughly with the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) scale @xcite , @xmath36 .",
    "physically there is a good reason for this coincidence .",
    "the bao scale is that of the largest acoustic wave in the plasma at last scattering . for scales larger than this",
    "the spectrum of initial density perturbations is roughly scale invariant with a density contrast @xmath37 in baryons , and @xmath38 in cold dark matter . below the bao scale",
    "initial density contrasts may be amplified by acoustic waves in the plasma , so the amplitude of initial density contrasts is somewhat larger , particularly at the scales associated with the higher order odd acoustic peaks .",
    "the bao scale therefore provides a demarcation between the linear and nonlinear regimes of the subsequent growth of structure .    at first",
    ", it might seem contradictory that the amplification of the primordial density perturbations corresponding to the first acoustic peak should give a small enhancement which in the standard  model can treated in the linear regime of perturbation theory with good observational agreement , whereas higher order peaks give enhancements which give rise to a nonlinear regime .",
    "however , it must also be remembered that perturbations are nested , so that in some cases we get amplifications on top of amplifications .",
    "characteristic features will arise from the fact that at last scattering the odd acoustic peaks corresponds to compression in gravitational potential wells and rarefaction in potential peaks , whereas the even acoustic peaks correspond to rarefaction in potential wells and compression in potential peaks .",
    "the odd peaks will thus produce increasing amplifications of structure , while even peaks will somewhat undo the amplifications ( but not completely on account of baryon drag ) .",
    "the fact that the diameter of the dominant voids at @xmath39 @xcite@xcite is close to one third of @xmath36 is seen to be a consequence of these structures growing from the additional amplification provided by the third acoustic peak .",
    "since voids are regions which appear to expand at faster rates ] than walls , with density contrasts growing to @xmath40 at late times , the exact ratios of scales of the acoustic peaks at last scattering are not preserved in the nonlinear regime today .",
    "in fact , a precise measurement of the difference between the ratio @xmath41 and @xmath42 would provide useful constraints on the variation of the hubble parameter in the nonlinear regime .",
    "since voids are the dominant nonlinear structures in the cosmic web , the beginning of an emergence of a notion of homogeneity at scales @xmath43 @xcite may be related cutoff in the statistics of void diameters at @xmath33 found by pan  @xcite , rather than a scale related to the second acoustic peak . since the even acoustic peaks represent deamplified initial density contrasts , they are unlikely to have very clear - cut signatures in cosmic structure .      in the standard cosmology",
    "it is often assumed that as the domain @xmath44 of a spatial average is made larger and larger at the present epoch , the density contrast @xmath45 will diminish to small values which match those at the last scattering epoch .",
    "however , this assumes constraints on the notion of statistical homogeneity over and above that in the  model the acoustic scale can be fit without such a restriction on spatial curvature . ] those required for a universe that has evolved from an initial density perturbation spectrum that was close to scale - invariant , as is consistent with the observed cmb anisotropies and primordial inflation . given initial nested density fluctuations on arbitrarily large spatial scales ,",
    "then if any arbitrarily large domain @xmath44 evolves independently by close to flrw evolution , its density at the present epoch will always have evolved from a perturbation that was within the initial spectrum , but not necessarily exactly the mean .",
    "we can therefore crudely estimate the standard deviation of the density of cells on scales larger than @xmath1 by assuming that each cell evolves as an independent friedman universe from a smooth perturbation at the epoch of last scattering .",
    "( this assumes that the backreaction contributions to be discussed in sec .  [ back ]",
    "do not dominate the volume  average evolution . ) using the friedmann equation with pressureless dust only , for which @xmath46,\\ ] ] we obtain a present epoch density contrast 0(h)^2_t(1+z)^2 .",
    "[ est]here the density contrast is relative to the critical density , so that @xmath47 etc , where @xmath48 is a density parameter for the isolated region only .",
    "thus if we take @xmath49 at last scattering ( for a cdm density contrast ) , when @xmath50 and when evolution is roughly matter - dominated with @xmath51 and @xmath52 , we are led to @xmath53 if @xmath54 .",
    "this crude estimate can be compared to the actual density variance determined from large scale structure surveys @xcite .",
    "sylos labini @xcite determined the variance in the number density of luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) in the sdss - dr7 by dividing the full sample of 53,066 galaxies in the redshift range @xmath55 into @xmath56 equal nonoverlapping volumes . over the range @xmath57",
    ", they found a standard deviation of order 8% , consistent with an earlier measurement of 7% by hogg  @xcite in a smaller lrg sample .",
    "these values are very close to our order of magnitude estimate of 6% , which has still not been corrected to include radiation at last - scattering , or the effects of backreaction at late epochs .",
    "given a nearly scale  invariant spectrum of nested density perturbations , we expect that the variance in density should not decrease appreciably if sample volumes are increased at nearby redshifts . in principle",
    ", it should be possible to calculate the variance as a function of scale , given the constraints from the cmb anisotropy spectrum at long wavelengths .",
    "for spatial slices at higher redshifts , looking further back in time , the variance would decrease in accord with ( [ est ] )  provided that a sample of objects such as lrgs can be found which does not exhibit strong evolutionary effects over the range of redshifts in question . in summary , in order to coarse - grain fluid cells in such a way that the size of a cell is larger than the largest typical nonlinear structures , with a mass that does not change on average from last scattering until today , observations show that we should coarse - grain fluid cells at a scale of order @xmath34@xmath1 .",
    "this scale will be called the statistical homogeneity scale ( shs ) .",
    "such a scale marks the transition from a nonlinear regime in which there is a very large variance in @xmath58 , to a regime in which cosmological average evolution with a single hubble parameter becomes well defined .",
    "it does not mark a scale at which average evolution necessarily becomes precisely flrw , nor at which density contrasts become completely negligible .",
    "rather variations on spatial scales larger than the shs at the present epoch are bounded by a maximum @xmath59 , as is consistent with observations . in this subsection",
    "we have presented a summary of observational results to be accounted for in cosmological coarse - graining , without assuming any details about backreaction .",
    "there is one other observational puzzle which also requires mention : the sandage - de vaucouleurs paradox .",
    "this is the puzzle that in conventional ways of thinking , we should expect large statistical scatter in the peculiar velocities of galaxies below the shs , if they are indeed `` particles of dust '' .",
    "in fact , on scales of order @xmath60mpc the statistical scatter should be so large that no linear hubble law can be extracted .",
    "yet @xmath60mpc is the very scale on which hubble originally found his famous linear law .",
    "this statistical quietness of the local hubble flow is difficult to reconcile with conventional understanding . in any flrw universe which expands forever ,",
    "peculiar velocities do decay .",
    "however , the  parameters required for the velocity dispersion predicted by structure formation to match the observed velocity dispersion , do not coincide with the concordance parameters @xcite .",
    "the problem of coarse - graining in general relativity in a bottom - up fashion is little studied . in principle , it is a very interesting question , which should deal , e.g. , at the galactic level with the problem of replacing the weyl curvature of individual schwarzschild or kerr solutions by a coarse - grained ricci curvature for a dust fluid .",
    "higher levels of coarse - graining in the hierarchy ( [ coarse ] ) involve further physical questions . rather than dealing with multi - scale problems ,",
    "the few existing studies simplify the hierarchy ( [ coarse ] ) to a single step .",
    "korzyski @xcite has proposed a covariant coarse - graining procedure , which could conceivably be applied to any step in the hierarchy ( [ coarse ] ) for which the starting point is the metric of a known dust solution .",
    "korzyski s idea is to isometrically embed the boundary of a comoving dust - filled domain  required to have @xmath61 topology with positive scalar curvature  into a three - dimensional euclidean space , and to construct a `` fictitious '' three - dimensional fluid velocity which induces the same infinitesimal metric deformation on the embedded surface as the `` true '' dust flow does on the domain boundary in the original spacetime .",
    "this velocity field is used to uniquely assign coarse - grained expressions for the volume expansion and shear to the original domain .",
    "an additional construction using the pushforward of the arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) shift vector @xcite is used to similarly obtain a coarse - grained vorticity .",
    "the coarse - grained quantities are quasilocal functionals which depend only on the geometry of the boundary of the relevant domain .",
    "this formalism is at an early stage of development , but could conceivably provide new methods for attacking the fitting problem .      the lindquist ",
    "wheeler model @xcite is a lattice based approach , which has received new interest recently @xcite@xcite .",
    "the coarse - graining hierarchy ( [ coarse ] ) is replaced by the simplified scheme with the proviso that @xmath62 does not represent a continuum metric in the usual sense .",
    "rather , by matching the spherical boundaries of radially expanding geodesics in the schwarzschild geometries of a regular lattice of equal point masses , the friedmann equations are obtained @xcite .",
    "the matching is exact only at the points where the radial spheres intersect and is approximate in the regions in which spheres overlap or are excluded .",
    "a continuum cosmological geometry is thus realized only approximately .",
    "this model is analogous to the swiss cheese models @xcite in the sense that the point group symmetry of the lattice is a discretized version of a system with overall global spatial homogeneity .",
    "ray - tracing studies in the spatially flat lindquist  wheeler model lead to results which are almost identical to that of the exact einstein - de sitter solution .",
    "while this demonstrates that the lindquist  wheeler does provide a consistent lattice description of the flrw models , it unfortunately does not give any indication of how one should treat the problem of inhomogeneity , without discrete symmetries .",
    "the terms `` coarse - graining '' and `` averaging '' are often used interchangeably in a loose sense .",
    "however , whereas coarse - graining is generically a bottom - up process , averaging is top - down : one is interested in the overall average dynamics and evolution , usually without direct consideration of the details of the course - graining procedure .",
    "whereas coarse - graining is little studied , considerably more attention has been paid to averaging .",
    "several approaches have been pursued and are discussed in many reviews including , e.g. , those of buchert @xcite , van den hoogen @xcite and clarkson  @xcite .",
    "cosmological averaging typically starts from the assumption that a well - defined average exists , with a number of assumed properties . if one assumes that the einstein field equations ( [ efe ] ) are valid for some general inhomogeneous geometry , @xmath63 , then given some as yet unspecified averaging procedure denoted by angle brackets , the average of ( [ efe ] ) gives = -12^_=8gc^4 .",
    "[ aefe ] a number of choices are possible at this point since there is no _ a priori _ reason to assume that @xmath64 is the einstein tensor of an exact geometry .    in the _ macroscopic gravity _",
    "approach , zalaletdinov @xcite@xcite takes the average inverse metric @xmath65 and the average ricci tensor @xmath66 as basic variables , so that -12^_+c^_=8gc^4 , [ zfe ] where the correlation functions @xmath67 are defined by the difference of the left hand sides of ( [ zfe ] ) and ( [ aefe ] ) .",
    "zalaletdinov provides additional mathematical structure to prescribe a covariant averaging scheme , thereby defining properties of the correlation functions .",
    "alternatively one can consider the difference of the general inhomogeneous metric and the averaged metric = |+,[metdef ] where @xmath68 , with inverse @xmath69 .",
    "one may now determine a connection @xmath70 , curvature tensor @xmath71 and einstein tensor @xmath72 based on the averaged metric , @xmath73 , alone .",
    "the differences @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 etc , then represent the _ backreaction _ of the averaged inhomogeneities on the average geometry determined from @xmath73 .",
    "furthermore , the average einstein field equations ( [ aefe ] ) may be written |g^ _",
    "_  = 8gc^4 .",
    "[ befe ] this expresses the fact that the einstein tensor of the average metric is not in general the average of the einstein tensor of the original metric . the processes of averaging and constructing the einstein tensor do not commute .",
    "equation ( [ aefe ] ) and ( [ befe ] ) are of course very similar , but may differ in both the definition of the average represented by the angle brackets , and also in the split of the background averaged einstein tensor and the correlation or backreaction terms .",
    "the manner in which averaging schemes differ often relate to whether the effects of backreaction are assumed to be weak or strong .",
    "the remarkable success of the standard cosmology , albeit with sources of dark matter and dark energy which have not been directly observed , has understandably led most researchers to assume that it must be correct , even if only in an average sense . as a consequence ,",
    "many researchers simply begin from the starting point that the flrw geometry must be the average , or very close to the average evolution .",
    "one can then either assume that    * there is no backreaction on average evolution but inhomogeneities are sufficiently large that they significantly affect the propagation of light , as in the swiss cheese @xcite and meatball @xcite models ; or * backreaction is sufficiently small that the changes to average evolution can be treated perturbatively about a homogeneous isotropic background , at least initially .",
    "the second approach , _ weak backreaction _",
    ", is of course intimately related to standard cosmological perturbation theory .",
    "one assumes that the average geometry @xmath73 of ( [ metdef ] ) is exactly flrw , and that the quantities @xmath77 can be treated as perturbative corrections .",
    "the issue of whether backreaction is significant or insignificant in the perturbative flrw context is a matter of much debate , with different authors coming to different conclusions , which may be traced to various differences in assumptions made .",
    "these issues are discussed in many reviews , such as those of clarkson  @xcite and kolb @xcite , and will not be discussed in detail here . in my view",
    "this debate shows that there are potential problems , which can not be resolved by staying within perturbation theory .",
    "in fact , all researchers are well aware that there is a nonlinear regime in structure formation , which is explored by @xmath56-body simulations in the standard cosmology . since there is as yet no rigorous procedure for coarse - graining the gravitational degrees of freedom which describe the small - scale structures , the perturbative approach can only be valid given an implicit assumption that there is no new physics to be found when coarse - graining the hierarchy ( [ coarse ] ) .",
    "such an assumption underlies a typical argument against backreaction : if we _ assume _ a flrw geometry , and estimate the magnitude of the perturbations using typical rotational and peculiar velocities of galaxies , then the corrections are small @xcite .",
    "however , at late epochs galaxies and galaxy clusters are not homogeneously distributed , and can not be considered as randomly distributed gas particles on scales of tens of megaparsecs below the shs .",
    "the dominant structures on these scales are voids of diameter @xmath4 with density contrasts @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "using galaxy peculiar velocities as an estimate of @xmath58 is therefore misplaced .",
    "there is no direct evidence that a spatially homogeneous geometry is the correct one below the shs .",
    "it may thus simply be incorrect to assume that a flrw model exactly describes the average evolution of the universe at the largest scales for all times .",
    "approaches which do not make the restrictive assumption of average flrw evolution are those with _",
    "strong backreaction_.",
    "if einstein s equations for a single metric with a prescribed energy - momentum tensor source are not the relevant equations for describing the average evolution of the universe on cosmological scales , then new physical ingredients are required , either explicitly in the averaging formalism itself , or else implicitly in relating the results of a particular formalism to observations . after all , our measurements involve physical rulers and clocks adapted to a local geometry , and this local geometry must somehow be matched to the statistical geometry that describes average cosmic evolution .",
    "strong backreaction as a solution to the problem of dark energy elicits much confusion in the community , as typified by the statement that dark energy is _ just _ an issue of inhomogeneities , and that it is entirely solved _ within _ general relativity .",
    "even advocates of strong backreaction might disagree with this statement , depending on what is meant by `` general relativity '' .",
    "there is a widely held view , particularly among those not involved in general relativity research , that it consists solely of completed old physics .",
    "however , those better acquainted with general relativity know that even setting aside the regime of quantum gravity , general relativity is not a final complete theory , but contains many open and unsolved questions  in particular in relation to gravitational energy and entropy and the averaging problem .",
    "strong backreaction does involve new physics , but in my view the new physics must involve a natural extension of the principles of relativity into regimes which einstein did not envisage when he wrote down his field equations in 1915 . whether one wishes to call it `` general relativity '' or",
    "`` cosmological relativity '' or something else is therefore a matter of taste .",
    "the essential point is that one is proposing new rules for the geometrical structure of spacetime on cosmological scales .",
    "the cosmological spacetime is to be a statistical average geometry .",
    "any process of taking an average will in general break the general covariance of einstein s equations .",
    "there are differing approaches to this , which alternatively involve spacetime or spatial averages .",
    "many mathematical approaches exist , including ricci flow @xcite@xcite , group averaging of the flrw isometry group @xcite , covariant frame - bundle averaging @xcite and constant mean ( extrinsic ) curvature ( cmc ) flows @xcite . here",
    "i will just very briefly outline the two approaches which have attracted the most attention , largely due to zalaletdinov and buchert .",
    "zalaletdinov has developed a theory called _ macroscopic gravity _ based on spacetime averages @xcite .",
    "his aim is to consistently average the cartan equations from first principles , in analogy to the averaging of the microscopic maxwell ",
    "lorentz equations in electromagnetism .",
    "however , whereas electrodynamics is linear in the fields on the fixed background of minkowski spacetime , gravity demands an averaging of the nonlinear geometry of spacetime itself and is considerably more complicated .",
    "additional mathematical structures are required to average tensors in a covariant manner on a given manifold , @xmath79 . to",
    "this end zalaletdinov introduces bilocal averaging operators @xcite@xcite , @xmath80 , with support at two points @xmath81 and @xmath82 , which allow one to construct a bitensor extension , @xmath83 , of a tensor @xmath84 according to _ ( x , x)=^_(x , x)t^_(x ) ^_(x,x ) .",
    "the bitensor extension is then integrated over a 4-dimensional spacetime region , @xmath85 , to obtain a regional average according to    @xmath86 is the spacetime volume of the region @xmath87 .",
    "the bitensor transforms as a tensor at every point but is a scalar when integrated over a region for the purpose of averaging .",
    "macroscopic gravity is a general covariant averaging formalism , rather than an approach which was specifically formulated with cosmology in mind . in order to make contact with cosmology",
    ", additional assumptions have been made .",
    "for example , paranjape and singh considered a spatial averaging limit @xcite .",
    "other studies have made the assumption , similar to the weak backreaction approach , that the average geometry is flrw @xcite@xcite . in that case",
    "it was found that the macroscopic gravity correlation terms take the form of a spatial curvature , even though a spatially _ flat _ flrw geometry was assumed for the average geometry @xcite .    in my view , although zalaletdinov s formalism is mathematically elegant , it has weaknesses as a physical theory .",
    "in particular , it has been designed to closely resemble general relativity itself .",
    "apart from the fact that it deals with two geometric scales  a microscopic one and a macroscopic one  there is no scale in the final theory .",
    "cosmological observations suggest a particular hierarchy of scales ( [ coarse ] ) , which may involve physical issues more complex than simply taking one step from a microscopic theory to a macroscopic theory of gravity . in particular , the coarse - graining of the gravitational degrees of freedom involving binding energy at one level and the kinetic energy of expansion at another , may give rise to qualitatively new phenomena . rather than seeking to mimic the steps involved in coarse - graining matter degrees of freedom , we need to specify macroscopic scales and physical principles relevant to coarse - graining in cosmology .      in the late 1990s ,",
    "building on earlier work @xcite , buchert developed an approach @xcite for the spatial averaging of scalar quantities associated with the einstein field equations ( [ efe ] ) , with cosmological averages in a fully nonperturbative setting in mind at the outset .",
    "he applied the @xmath88 adm spacetime split @xcite , which is a natural approach if the einstein field equations ( [ efe ] ) are to be viewed as evolution equations .",
    "rather than tackling the mathematically difficult problem of averaging tensors , buchert averaged scalar quantities in general inhomogeneous spacetimes with perfect fluid energy  momentum sources .",
    "such scalars include the density , @xmath89 , expansion , @xmath90 , and scalar shear , @xmath91 etc .",
    "for an arbitrary manifold , one can always locally choose adm coordinates , ^2=-^0 ^ 0+g_ij(t,)^i^j , [ split]where @xmath92 , and @xmath93 define the adm lapse function , @xmath94 , and shift vector , @xmath95 .",
    "such coordinates can only be chosen globally if one restricts the evolution problem to that of irrotational flow , as buchert does . in that case ( [ split ] ) may be assumed to apply over global @xmath96const spatial hypersurfaces . for a dust source we can then choose synchronous coordinates with @xmath97 and @xmath98 . with these choices ,",
    "the einstein equations may be averaged on a domain , @xmath44 , of the spatial hypersurfaces , @xmath87 , to give 3 ^ 2 ^ 2&=&8g - c^2-,[b1 ] + 3&=&-4g+,[b2 ] + & & -45pt_t+3=0 , [ b3]where an overdot denotes a @xmath99derivative , and 23(-)^2 - 2 = 23(^2-^2)- 2 , [ backr]is the _",
    "kinematic backreaction_. in these equations angle brackets denote the spatial volume average of a quantity , so that @xmath100 is the average spatial curvature , for example , with @xmath101 being the volume of the domain @xmath102 . note that @xmath103 is _",
    "not _ the scale factor of any given geometry , but rather is defined in terms of the average volume according to ( t)^1/3 .",
    "it follows that the hubble parameter appearing in ( [ b1])([b3 ] ) is related to the volume - average expansion scalar , @xmath90 , by = 13.[hav ] the condition _",
    "t(^6)+^4c^2_t(^2)=0 , [ intq]is required to ensure that ( [ b1 ] ) is the integral of ( [ b2 ] ) . in buchert",
    "s scheme the non - commutativity of averaging and time evolution is described by the exact relation @xcite _",
    "t-= -[comm]for any scalar , @xmath104 .",
    "( [ b2 ] ) is suggestive since it implies that if the backreaction term is large enough ",
    "e.g. , for a large variance in expansion with small shear ",
    "then the volume average acceleration , @xmath105 , could be positive , even if the expansion of all regions is locally decelerating .",
    "although the fraction of the volume occupied by the faster expanding regions is initially tiny , this fraction may nonetheless become significant at late epochs , skewing the average to give an illusion of acceleration during the transition epoch to void domination . whether this is observationally viable ,",
    "however , depends crucially on : ( i ) how large the variance in expansion rates can grow given realistic initial constraints on density perturbations ; and ( ii ) the operational interpretation of the buchert formalism .",
    "since buchert s formalism is a statistical one , additional assumptions are required to relate solutions of the buchert equations to cosmological observations .",
    "the  cosmology , to be discussed in secs .  [ ideas ] , [ ts ] , provides such a scheme .",
    "the relationship between average homogeneity and observations is crucial for the interpretation any averaging scheme for inhomogeneous cosmology .",
    "the very near isotropy of the cmb demonstrates that when photons travel to us from the surface of last scattering , they traverse a geometry which to a very good approximation must be isotropic in some average sense .",
    "if we assume a statistical copernican principle , then we must also expect some sort of average notion of spatial homogeneity .",
    "the hard question is how to relate the observed averaged isotropy of the geometry on our past light cone to an appropriate notion of average spatial homogeneity .",
    "most cosmologists physical intuition is guided largely by the flrw models , within which average homogeneity can be characterized in ( at least ) three distinct ways :    a.   the notion of average spatial homogeneity is described by a class of ideal comoving observers with synchronized clocks .",
    "b.   the notion of average spatial homogeneity is described by average surfaces of constant spatial curvature ( orthogonal to the geodesics of the ideal comoving observers ) . c.   the expansion rate at which the ideal comoving observers separate within the hypersurfaces of average spatial homogeneity is uniform .",
    "while these notions coincide for the flrw geometries , it is not generally the case once spatial homogeneity is only approximate rather than exact , given that spatial curvature is characterized by more than a single scalar .    already in perturbation theory about flrw models , one can specialize to spacetime foliations which preserve one of the notions ( i)(iii ) of average spatial homogeneity more fundamentally than the other two . among the foliations discussed in the classic work of bardeen",
    "@xcite we can recognize those of each type above : the _ comoving hypersurfaces _ ( and related synchronous gauge ) take property ( i ) as more fundamental ; the _ minimal shear hypersurfaces _ , where @xmath106 is the extrinsic curvature , @xmath107 the intrinsic metric , and @xmath108 .",
    "for general perturbations the hypersurfaces are defined by @xmath109 , where the bar denotes a covariant derivative with respect to the intrinsic 3metric . ] ( and related newtonian gauge ) are one type of foliation for which property ( ii ) is more fundamental ; and finally the _ uniform hubble flow hypersurfaces _ take property ( iii ) as more fundamental .",
    "bik , katz and lynden - bell @xcite have further analysed foliations of perturbed flrw models , with a view to enabling gauge choices in which the rotations and accelerations of local inertial frames can be determined directly from local energy ",
    "momentum perturbations @xmath110 .",
    "they consider uniform hubble flow hypersurfaces ; uniform intrinsic scalar curvature hypersurfaces ; and minimal shear hypersurfaces .",
    "the _ uniform intrinsic scalar curvature hypersurfaces _ provide a foliation in addition to those considered by bardeen , which also take property ( ii ) as more fundamental . having chosen hypersurfaces bik , katz and lynden - bell further fix the gauge by adopting a condition similar to the minimal shift distortion condition of smarr and york @xcite . for each choice of hypersurface",
    "it then follows that the coordinates of local inertial frames are more or less uniquely determined by the energy ",
    "momentum perturbations @xmath110 . in this sense",
    "these gauges might be seen as embodying mach s principle .",
    "they are substantially more restrictive than the commonly used synchronous gauge or the generalized lorenz  de donder gauge @xcite .    in the nonlinear regime , below the shs ,",
    "not all of the conditions ( i)(iii ) can apply , even if they apply in some average sense on scales larger than the shs .",
    "the question is should any of these notions apply _ below _ the shs ?",
    "the  scenario begins from the premise that a notion of uniform hubble flow can be applied below the shs , in a way which takes mach s principle into the nonlinear regime , as we discuss in sec .",
    "[ ideas ] .",
    "this will involve a reinterpretation of the buchert formalism @xcite , which grew as a generalization of averaging in newtonian cosmology @xcite , and is based on an adm approach on constant time hypersurfaces of observers `` comoving with the dust '' . since the split of space and time is unique in newtonian theory , from the newtonian viewpoint this is the only natural choice one can make .",
    "however , this is not the case in general relativity .",
    "if particles of dust were invariant from the time of last scattering until the present , then there would be no physical ambiguity about the notion of `` comoving with the dust '' .",
    "in such a case , a choice of constant time hypersurfaces with a synchronous gauge is well motivated .",
    "however , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ grain ] , in order to consistently deal with both the particles of ionic dust in voids , and also with ` particles ' of dust larger than galaxies , we have to coarse - grain at the shs over fluid elements which are themselves expanding .",
    "this demands coarse - graining over the gravitational degrees of freedom relating to spatial curvature , the kinetic energy of expansion , and gravitational binding energy .",
    "we will adopt the viewpoint that the buchert time coordinate is a collective degree of freedom of spacetime regions when coarse - grained at the shs , and that if we form thin sandwiches from such regions in the time direction then they can be combined as effective hypersurfaces on which the buchert formalism can be applied .",
    "however , new physics applies within the coarse - grained cells , as we will discuss next .",
    "in considering the averaging problem , it is inevitable that at some level one must deal with mach s principle , which may be stated @xcite : _ `` local inertial frames ( lifs ) are determined through the distributions of energy and momentum in the universe by some weighted average of the apparent motions''_. mach s principle strongly guided einstein in developing general relativity as a theory in which spacetime is a relational structure . as einstein stated in his first work on cosmology : `` in a consistent theory of relativity there can be no inertia relatively to ` space ' , but only an inertia of masses relatively to one another '' @xcite .",
    "the refinement of the understanding of inertia that einstein left us with in relation to gravity , the strong equivalence principle ( sep ) , only goes part - way in addressing mach s principle .",
    "the sep tells us that we can always remove the effects of gravity in a lif in the neighbourhood of a point .",
    "however , it says nothing about the average effect of gravity , and therefore nothing about the `` weighted average of the apparent motions '' of the matter in the universe .",
    "the question of what gravitational mass  energy is in general relativity is deeply subtle . on account of the sep we can always get rid of gravity in the neighbourhood of a point , so any reasonable definition is necessarily quasilocal , involving integration over a bounding surface .",
    "the subject of quasilocal gravitational energy has occupied many mathematical relativists @xcite , and there is no universally agreed definition .",
    "this may reflect the fact that different notions of energy are applicable in different circumstances , just as in thermodynamics we deal with internal energy , and various free energies .",
    "two of the most familiar gravitational masses are the adm mass @xcite which is defined by an integral on a 2-sphere at spatial infinity for a general asymptotically flat spacetime , and the komar mass @xcite m =- c^28g_s^2_^*[kom ] which is similarly defined for asymptotically flat spacetimes with an asymptotically timelike killing vector field , @xmath111 .",
    "the komar mass is identical to that appearing in the newtonian gravitational potential energy term , @xmath112 , in an asymptotic expansion , @xmath113 , at spatial infinity @xcite .",
    "most of the effort in the field of quasilocal gravitational energy has focused on ways of defining general geometrical energy quantities which reduce to familiar results in the case of isolated systems .",
    "some interesting examples include the definitions of brown and york @xcite , and epp @xcite . with a few exceptions of quasilocal energies calculated in particular backgrounds , ( e.g. , @xcite@xcite ) ,",
    "very little has been done in a cosmological context , however .    for asymptotically flat geometries",
    "the average of the distribution of energy and momentum in the external universe is zero . in the actual universe",
    "the spacetime external to any concentrated mass also contains matter so that its geometry does not have a time symmetry but is necessarily dynamically evolving . in the  scenario",
    "it is proposed that in place of spatial infinity in ( [ kom ] ) the mass definition for the largest bound structure should be made in reference to _",
    "finite infinity _ , a timelike surface within which the average volume expansion is zero . in general",
    "there will be matter collapsing inwards around any virialized regions , and thus the finite infinity surface will be expanding at the boundary .",
    "( see figure  [ fig_fi ] . )",
    "the density of a shell at the finite infinity surface defines the critical density . in a universe which is on average underdense there",
    "must always be such a transition zone between the overdense regions and the surrounding underdensity .",
    "accounting for the average effect of matter to address mach s principle effectively means specifying an appropriate definition of an asymptotic region , such as finite infinity , containing any local geometry .",
    "local geometry should be determined by local matter , and if matter on a bounding sphere obeys some symmetry principle then we should look no further in determining the local standard of inertia .",
    "since the very early universe started out being very close to spatially homogeneous and isotropic and can not evolve arbitrarily far from from its initial conditions , it is proposed that such symmetries can always be found at a _ regional _ scale .      in the  scenario",
    "we restrict the geometry of expanding regions ( the walls and voids ) in the final stages of coarse - graining ( [ coarse ] ) to an average over domains which each obey the _ cosmological equivalence principle _ ( cep ) @xcite :    _ in cosmological averages it is always possible to choose a suitably defined spacetime region , the cosmological inertial region ( cir ) , on whose boundary average motions ( timelike and null ) can be described by geodesics in a geometry which is minkowski up to some time - dependent conformal transformation _ , ^2= a^2 ( ) .",
    "[ cif]a suitably defined region here refers to one which is smaller than the scalar curvature scale within underdense voids , or alternatively is the finite infinity scale for systems containing overdensities .",
    "typically this could be of order @xmath114@xmath32 for finite infinity regions bounding small groups or rich clusters of galaxies .    since the average geometry is a time ",
    "dependent conformal scaling of minkowski space , the cep reduces to the standard sep if @xmath115 is constant , or alternatively over very short time intervals during which the time variation of @xmath115 can be neglected .",
    "it is well  known that for the exchange of photons between comoving observers in the background ( [ cif ] ) , to leading order the observed redshift of one comoving observer relative to another yields the same local hubble law , whether the exact relation , @xmath116 , is used or alternatively the radial doppler formula , @xmath117^{1/2}$ ] , of special relativity is used , before making a local approximation . for a small spacetime region in a spatially homogeneous isotropic background",
    "this is a direct consequence of the sep : it is impossible to distinguish whether particles are moving radially in a flat space , or alternatively are at rest in an expanding space .",
    "the cep makes the indistinguishability of radial motion from volume expansion a feature of regional averages on scales up to @xmath114@xmath32 , while allowing for inhomogeneity between this scale and the shs .",
    "however , it disallows global coherent anisotropic expansion of the sort typified by bianchi models .",
    "bianchi models single out preferred directions in the global background universe , thereby imbuing spacetime with absolute qualities that go beyond an essentially relational structure . to make general relativity truly machian",
    "such backgrounds need to be outlawed by principle , and the cep achieves this while still allowing inhomogeneity .",
    "the cir metric ( [ cif ] ) is of course the spatially flat flrw metric , which in the standard cosmology is taken to be the geometry of the whole universe . in our case",
    "the whole universe is inhomogeneous subject to the restriction that it is possible to always choose ( [ cif ] ) as a regional average in expanding regions .      to understand the physical implications of taking an average geometry ( [ cif ] ) as the relevant average reference geometry for the relative calibration of rulers and clocks in the absence of global killing vectors , let us construct a thought experiment analogy that i will call the _ semi - tethered lattice_. take a lattice of observers in minkowski space , initially moving isotropically away from each nearest neighbour at uniform initial velocities .",
    "the lattice of observers are chosen to be equidistant along mutually oriented @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 axes .",
    "suppose that the observers are each connected to six others by tethers of negligible mass and identical tension along the mutually oriented spatial axes .",

    "the tethers initially unreel at the same uniform rate , representing a ` recession velocity ' .",
    "each observer carries synchronized clocks , and at a prearranged local proper time all observers apply brakes to each spool , the braking mechanisms having been preprogrammed to deliver the same impulse as a function of local time .",
    "applying brakes in the semi - tethered lattice experiment is directly analogous to the decelerating volume expansion of ( [ cif ] ) due to some average homogeneous matter density , because it maintains the homogeneity and isotropy of space over a region as large as the lattice .",
    "work is done in applying the brakes , and energy can be extracted from this  just as kinetic energy of expansion of the universe is converted to other forms by gravitational collapse . since brakes are applied in unison , however , there is _ no net force on any observer in the lattice _ , justifying the _ inertial frame _ interpretation , even though each observer has a nonzero 4-acceleration with respect to the global minkowski frame .",
    "the braking function may have an arbitrary time profile ; provided it is applied uniformly at every lattice site the clocks will remain synchronous in the comoving sense , as all observers have undergone the same relative deceleration .",
    "whereas the strong equivalence principle allows us to define local inertial frames , related to each other by local lorentz transformations acting at a point , the cosmological equivalence principle refers to a _ collective _ symmetry of the background . in defining the averaging region of the cir",
    "we are isolating just that part of the volume expansion which is regionally homogeneous and isotropic .",

    "the equivalence of the circumstance rests on the fact that by the evidence of the cmb the expansion of the universe was extremely uniform at the epoch of last scattering . at that time all regions had almost the _ same _ density  with tiny fluctuations  and the same uniform hubble flow . at late epochs ,",
    "suppose that in the frame of any average cosmological observer there are expanding regions of _ different _ density which have decelerated by different amounts by a given time , @xmath99 , according to that observer . then by the cep the local proper time of the comoving observers in the denser region , which has decelerated more , will be less than that of the equivalent observers in the less dense region which has decelerated less .",

    "consequently the _ proper time of the observers in the more dense cir will be less than that of those in the less dense cir _ , by equivalence of the two situations .",
    "the fact that a global minkowski observer does not exist in the second case does not invalidate the argument .",
    "the global minkowski time is just a coordinate label . in the cosmological case",

    "provided we can patch the regional frames together suitably , then if regions in such a slice _ are still expanding _ and have a significant density contrast we can expect a significant clock rate variance .",
    "this equivalence directly establishes the idea of a _ gravitational energy cost for a spatial curvature gradient _ , since the existence of expanding regions of different density within an average @xmath123const slice implies a gradient in the average ricci scalar curvature , @xmath124 , on one hand , while the fact that the local proper time varies on account of the relative deceleration implies a gradient in gravitational energy on the other .",
    "the variation of the normalization of asymptotic clocks due to a relative volume deceleration is a new physical effect .",
    "we are familiar with boosts in particular directions , which give significant effects only for large relative velocities ; e.g. , as required to remain stationary in strong gravitational fields . since we only consider weak fields the relative deceleration of the background is small .",

    "the magnitudes of the dipoles in the two frames coincide in the shell with mean radius @xmath378 , and also in the shell with @xmath379 , but the dipoles exhibit very different behaviour for the shells in between . in particular",
    ", the cmb frame dipole magnitude reaches a minimum of @xmath380 ( close to zero ) at @xmath381 , whereas for the lg frame @xmath382 in the same shell .",
    "the cmb frame dipole then increases while the lg frame dipole decreases .",
    "the dipole directions for independent shells within each frame are strongly consistent in the range @xmath383 . beyond @xmath379 ,",
    "the cmb frame dipole maintains statistically significant residual levels , while the lg frame dipole drops to a level statistically consistent with zero around @xmath384@xmath1 .",
    "it therefore appears that the boost to the cmb frame is largely compensating for the effect of structures in the range @xmath383 , which are also responsible for monopole variations of the hubble ` constant ' in the lg frame shown in fig .",
    "the results are consistent with a foreground density gradient producing an anisotropy in the distance ",
    "redshift relation which is almost , but not exactly , of the same nature as the doppler shift produced by a lorentz boost .",
    "rather than thinking purely about overdensities as in the attractor model , what is important below the shs are the peculiar foregrounds created by voids as well as by superclusters .",
    "those directions in which void  filled foregrounds are opposed to wall regions on the opposite side of the sky will lead to the strongest density gradients .",
    "relevant structures are identified in sec .",
    "iii@xmath126c of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it was further established in ref .",
    "@xcite that the gaussian window averaged sky map of angular hubble flow variation in the lg frame has a correlation coefficient of @xmath385 with the map that would be produced by the residual cmb temperature dipole in the lg rest frame .",
    "the correlation coefficient is insensitive to the choice of the gaussian window smoothing angle in the range @xmath386 .",
    "the strong correlation of the two sky maps is consistent with the hypothesis that the cmb temperature dipole is only partly due to a lorentz boost .",
    "the portion usually attributed to the motion of the lg might be largely due to the differential expansion of space produced by peculiar foregrounds below the shs . in the lg frame",
    "the residual temperature dipole is @xmath387mk . for the  model with planck best - fit parameters ,",
    "this would be produced by an anisotropy @xmath388 in the distance to the surface of last scattering .",
    "the value for the  model is essentially the same .",
    "if produced by the differential expansion of foreground structures within a mean distance of @xmath33 , this amounts to a 0.5% anisotropy on these scales , which is entirely plausiblea of ref .",
    "@xcite a multipole decomposition of the hubble expansion should be developed , in spherical shells , to determine whether the dipole converges to the required amplitude . ] .",
    "there is differential expansion of space below the shs at all locations , of a magnitude bounded by the growth of structure from the initial perturbations at the surface of last scattering .",
    "cmb photons which traverse large distances see an average of all of these variations , producing an average distance to the last scattering surface .",
    "however , the last stretch of the journey produces slight differences that depend on peculiar density foregrounds .",
    "the same small residual anisotropies will apply to all cosmic distance measurements on scales much greater than the shs , but at a level smaller than the uncertainties in many large scale measurements .    although it might generally be expected that a differential expansion of space would produce higher order multipole cmb anisotropies of a magnitude comparable to the cmb dipole , these are in fact highly suppressed for off  centre observers in voids @xcite , which represent a good first approximation for our actual local environment @xcite .",
    "ray tracing in a simple ltb void with parameters matched to the lg frame hubble dipole of fig .",
    "[ sdipfit ] gives a cmb quadrupole / dipole ratio of less than 0.1% @xcite .",
    "using the szekeres models @xcite one can perform ray tracing through exact solution geometries which more closely mimic our peculiar foregrounds ; while a higher quadrupole / dipole cmb ratio of order 1% is found , this is still observationally viable @xcite .",
    "the suggestion that a large fraction of the cmb dipole is not purely due to a boost is , of course , a radical departure for observational cosmology .",
    "however , a number of potential anomalies have been observed in the large angles multipoles of the cmb anisotropy spectrum for a decade now , and their significance has increased with the release of the planck data @xcite . a study by freeman  @xcite found that of several possible systematic errors , a 12% error in the cmb dipole subtraction stood out as the one possible effect which could potentially resolve the power asymmetry anomaly .",
    "as is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite a nonkinematic contribution to the foreground hubble expansion may also explain why attempts to measure the effects of aberration and frequency modulation in the doppler boosting of the cmb spectrum yield a boost direction which moves across the sky when only large angle multipoles are considered @xcite .",
    "aberration and frequency modulation can also be readily tested in the radio spectrum .",
    "rubart and schwarz @xcite have recently found that the assumption of a kinematic origin for the cosmic radio galaxy dipole is inconsistent at the 99.5% confidence level , using the nrao vla sky survey data .",
    "the direction of the radio dipole is consistent with that of the hubble variance dipole we find in the lg frame .",
    "observations over the last few decades have revealed a universe much more complex , varied and interesting than had been previously imagined .",
    "the observations are at present well in advance of our theoretical understanding .",
    "the phenomenon of apparent cosmic acceleration demands that we think more deeply about one of the central unsolved problems of general relativity : the nature of gravitational mass  energy , which can not be localized on account of the equivalence principle .",
    "the standard  model adds cold dark matter to make gravity stronger at some scales and then adds dark energy to make gravity weaker at larger scales , while keeping space rigidly expanding .",
    "both phenomena may be indicative of a renormalization of the notion of gravitational mass in a hierarchy of nonrigid spacetime structures .",
    "the  scenario is a from  first ",
    "principles attempt to come to grips with the essential physics of the fitting problem @xcite , and to specify a physically viable interpretation of the buchert averaging scheme @xcite without a smooth `` dark energy '' .",
    "a phenomenological model has been developed @xcite , which had remained observationally viable over the six years since its conception @xcite .",
    "much work remains to be done .",
    "in particular , while the tests of secs .",
    "[ lumd][timed ] give a means of comparing average cosmological quantities with those of the  model , the most exciting developments are to be made by considering physics below the ssh .",
    "this may also inform the development of tests related to the average growth of structure .",
    "it is below the ssh , where the structures are most inhomogeneous , that the most interesting differences between the  scenario and the standard cosmology are to be found . in the  model spacetime",
    "is spatially flat on these scales , while in the  scenario its spatial curvature varies greatly .",
    "a rigorous mathematical description of the statistical geometry on these scales remains to be determined .",
    "however , to develop such a description i believe we should not be guided simply by mathematical elegance but by physical principles and observations .    the simple idea that the finite infinity scale should define the cosmic rest frame for bound system observers led to the idea of testing the hubble expansion variation in the lg and ls frames , as well as in the cmb frame , with a result that was much more definitive than we ourselves anticipated @xcite",
    ". since the analysis of sec .",
    "[ hvar ] is model  independent it is not a direct verification of the  scenario ; but it is consistent with the  model and it is extremely hard to reconcile with the standard cosmology . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , a change to our understanding of the local hubble expansion variation and its effect on the cmb dipole may have some impact on many different aspects of observational cosmology , including not only cmb anomalies but also sneia systematics and the calibration of the distance scale .",

    "<S> these lecture notes review the theoretical problems associated with coarse - graining the observed inhomogeneous structure of the universe at late epochs , of describing average cosmic evolution in the presence of growing inhomogeneity , and of relating average quantities to physical observables . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , a detailed discussion of the timescape scenario is presented . in this scenario , </S>",
    "<S> dark energy is realized as a misidentification of gravitational energy gradients which result from gradients in the kinetic energy of expansion of space , in the presence of density and spatial curvature gradients that grow large with the growth of structure . </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenology and observational tests of the timescape model are discussed in detail , with updated constraints from planck satellite data . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , recent results on the variation of the hubble expansion on @xmath0 scales are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> the spherically averaged hubble law is significantly more uniform in the rest frame of the local group of galaxies than in the conventional rest frame assumed for the cosmic microwave background . </S>",
    "<S> this unexpected result supports a fundamental revision of the notion of the cosmic rest frame , consistent with the expectations of the timescape scenario .     </S>",
