    "one of the striking features of the measurements of deep inelastic scattering at hera is the strong rise of the proton structure function @xmath2 as @xmath3 decreases from @xmath4 to below @xmath5 @xcite . at first sight",
    "it appeared that the rise was due to the ( bfkl ) resummation of leading @xmath0 contributions . in this approach the basic dynamical quantity at small",
    "@xmath3 is the gluon distribution @xmath6 _ unintegrated _ over its transverse momentum @xmath7 .",
    "observables are computed in terms of @xmath8 via the @xmath7 factorization theorem . for example f_2",
    "f f_2^g = _ q e_q^2 b_q [ eq : a1 ] and where @xmath9 denotes a convolution in transverse ( @xmath7 ) , as well as longitudinal , momentum , see fig .",
    "@xmath10 is the off - shell gluon structure function which at lowest order is given by the quark box and crossed - box \" contributions , @xmath11 .",
    "on the other hand the conventional dglap approach is based on collinear factorization = _",
    "i e_i^2 p_qg g + _ i e_i^2 p_qq ( q_i+|q_i ) [ eq : a2 ] where @xmath12 is simply a convolution over longitudinal momentum .",
    "dglap evolution effectively sums up the leading @xmath13 contributions , and is able to describe the @xmath2 data at the smallest @xmath3 values observed ( even for @xmath14 ) with an appropriate choice of input parton distributions .",
    "these non - perturbative input shapes in @xmath3 mean that there is more freedom in the pure dglap description than in the bfkl approach .",
    "in the latter approach , the shape in @xmath3 emerges , in principle , from the perturbative @xmath0 resummation . in practice",
    "it is not so clear cut since non - perturbative , and also subleading @xmath15 , effects can modify the bfkl prediction . here",
    "we should attempt to find a unified description of @xmath2 which incorporates both ( dglap and bfkl ) of these perturbative effects .",
    "we argue that the unintegrated gluon distribution @xmath6 and the @xmath7 factorization theorem provides the natural framework for describing observables at small @xmath3 . to determine @xmath8 we arrange the bfkl equation so that we only need to solve it in the perturbative domain @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "we also include the residual dglap contributions .",
    "to be precise we have [ eq : b1 ] f ( x , k_t^2 ) & = & _ x^1 d z p_gg(z ) g ( , k_0 ^ 2 ) + +   + & + & k_t^2 _ x^1 _ k_0 ^ 2 +   + & + & _ x^1 d z ( - ) _ k_0",
    "^ 2^k_t^2 f ( , k_t^2 ) + _ x^1 d z p_gq ( , k_t^2 ) + where @xmath17 is taken from dglap because it is already included in bfkl .",
    "the input term comes from two sources : the @xmath18 parts of bfkl and dglap terms .",
    "we specify the input in terms of a simple two parameter form @xmath19 .",
    "in addition to restricting the solution of the bfkl equation to the perturbative region @xmath16 and to including the dglap terms , we have also introduced a @xmath20 function which imposes the constraint @xmath21 on the real gluon emissions .",
    "the origin of this constraint effects , but the kinematic constraint overrides the angular ordered constraint , except when @xmath22 in the large @xmath3 domain @xcite . ] is the requirement that the virtuality of the exchanged gluon is dominated by its transverse momentum @xmath23 .",
    "we take a running coupling @xmath24 , which is supported by the results of the next - to - leading order @xmath0 analyses of fadin , lipatov , camici and ciafaloni .",
    "the final term in ( [ eq : b1 ] ) depends on the quark singlet momentum distribution @xmath25 . at small @xmath3 the sea quark components",
    "@xmath26 of @xmath25 dominate .",
    "they are driven by the gluon via the @xmath27 transitions , that is @xmath28 where at lowest order @xmath29 is the box ( and crossed box ) contribution indicated in fig .",
    "besides the @xmath30 and @xmath31 integrations symbolically denoted by @xmath9 the box contribution implicitly includes an integration over the transverse momentum @xmath32 of the exchanged quark .",
    "the evolution equation for @xmath25 may be written in the form [ eq : b4 ] = s^(0 ) + _ q b_q ( k_t^2 = 0 ) zg ( z , k_0 ^ 2 ) + _ q b_q f + p_qq s_q + v where the first three terms on the right hand side are the @xmath33 \" contributions coming from the regions i , ii , iii of the @xmath31 and @xmath34 integrations that are shown in fig .  1(b ) .",
    "first , in the non - perturbative domain , region i , the @xmath35 sea quark contribution is parametrized in the form @xmath36 consistent with soft pomeron and counting rule expectations , where @xmath37 is independent of @xmath38 .",
    "the constant @xmath37 is fixed in terms of the two parameters , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , by the momentum sum rule . in region",
    "ii we apply the strong @xmath7 ordering approximation with @xmath41 so that the @xmath31 integration can be carried out to give a contribution proportional to @xmath42 .",
    "finally in region iii we evaluate the full box contribution ; this gives the main contribution and is responsible for the rise of @xmath2 with decreasing @xmath3 .",
    "the last two terms in ( [ eq : b4 ] ) give the sea @xmath43 sea evolution contribution , and the valence contribution @xmath44 which is taken directly from a recent parton set .",
    "the charm quark component of the sea is given totally by _",
    "qcd , since for @xmath45 the box @xmath46 is finite as @xmath47 due to @xmath48 .",
    "we solve the coupled integral equations ( [ eq : b1 ] ) and ( [ eq : b4 ] ) for the gluon @xmath8 and the quark singlet @xmath25 in the perturbative domain , @xmath16 .",
    "the only input is the gluon @xmath49 .",
    "we take @xmath50 .",
    "we determine the values of the two input parameters by fitting to the available data @xcite for @xmath2 with @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the continuous curves in fig .  2",
    "show the description of a sample of the data .",
    "overall the fit is excellent ; at least as good as that achieved in the recent global analyses .",
    "when we repeat the analysis with the kinematic constraint omitted we see that the description ( given by the dashed curves in fig .",
    "2 ) is not so good and , moreover , the extrapolation of the gluon to @xmath53 no longer describes the wa70 prompt photon data .",
    "how important are the @xmath0 effects ?",
    "first we replace the bfkl kernel in ( [ eq : b1 ] ) by the standard dglap splitting function , @xmath54 .",
    "we find that the gluon is not changed by much in the hera domain @xmath55 , compare the dashed and dotted curves in fig .",
    "3 . this effect is well known . in the power series expansion of the gluon anomalous dimension in @xmath56 the coefficients of the 2nd , 3rd and 5th terms are zero , where @xmath57 is the moment variable .",
    "on the other hand , when we use pure dglap evolution for the quark singlet , as well as the gluon , the difference is pronounced ; compare the dashed and dot - dashed curves in fig .",
    "we would like to conclude that we have a theoretically well - grounded and consistent formalism which , with the minimum of non - perturbative input , is able to give a good _ perturbative _ description of the observed structure of @xmath2 .",
    "moreover the bfkl / dglap components of @xmath2 are decided by dynamics . in this way we have made a determination of the _ universal _ gluon distribution @xmath6 which can be used , via the @xmath7 factorization theorem , to predict the behaviour of other observables at small @xmath3 .",
    "the predictions for @xmath2 ( charm ) and @xmath58 can be found in @xcite .",
