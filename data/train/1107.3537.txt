    "it is well known that the symmetry - adapted solution of the nonlinear hartree - fock ( hf ) equations of an electronic system is sometimes unstable .",
    "an unstable solution corresponds to a saddle point of the energy as a function of the orbital parameters , and breaking of space and/or spin symmetries of the wave function then necessarily leads to one or several lower - energy hf solutions .",
    "the stability conditions of the hf equations were first formulated by thouless  @xcite , and the different instabilities were first categorized by iek and paldus  @xcite . for closed - shell systems",
    ", one may encounter `` singlet instabilities '' when only spatial symmetry is broken , and `` triplet ( or nonsinglet ) instabilities '' when spin symmetry is also broken .",
    "there is thus a symmetry dilemma  @xcite in choosing between the symmetry - adapted wave function of higher hf energy and a symmetry - broken wave function of lower hf energy , in particular as a reference for a post - hartree - fock calculation .    a clear example is provided by closed - shell hydrogen rings h@xmath0 with equal bond lengths  @xcite ( see , also , ref .  ) .",
    "the symmetry - adapted hf solution exhibits singlet instabilities for sufficiently large numbers of hydrogen atoms , and one can obtain symmetry - broken hf solutions with orbitals localizing on either the atoms or the bonds .",
    "however , both mller - plesset perturbation theory and linearized coupled cluster doubles theory ( also called cepa0 or dmbpt@xmath1 ) give a lower total energy when starting from the symmetry - adapted solution than when starting from the symmetry - broken solutions , which casts doubts on the physical significance of the symmetry - broken solutions .",
    "of course , the symmetry dilemma would be removed with a full configuration - interaction calculation which must give one unique solution , independent of the orbitals used .",
    "quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) approaches are alternatives to the traditional quantum chemistry methods  @xcite .",
    "the two most commonly used variants are variational monte carlo ( vmc ) which simply evaluates the energy of a flexible trial wave function by stochastic sampling , and fixed - node diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) which improves upon vmc by projecting the trial wave function onto the ground state subject to the condition that the nodes of the projected wave function are the same as those of the trial wave function . for large systems ,",
    "the most common form of the trial wave function is a jastrow factor multiplied by a fixed hf determinant ( though for small systems one can do much better by replacing the hf determinant by a linear combination of optimized slater determinants ) .",
    "if a system exhibits hf instabilities , then qmc also faces the symmetry dilemma in choosing between different hf wave functions .",
    "indeed , different hf wave functions necessarily lead to different energies not only in vmc , but also in dmc since the nodes of these hf wave functions are generally different .",
    "this symmetry dilemma in dmc is only due to the fixed - node approximation , since without this approximation dmc would give one unique solution , independent of the trial wave function .",
    "of course , for systems that are not very large , symmetry breaking could probably be avoided in the first place by optimizing the orbitals within vmc  @xcite , instead of using fixed hf orbitals .    in this work , we study the impact of the hf symmetry dilemma for qmc in hydrogen rings h@xmath0 . in sec .",
    "ii , we review the hf symmetry - breaking problem in these systems , and discuss the effect of using a slater basis versus a gaussian basis . in sec .",
    "iii , we explain the qmc methodology and report our vmc and dmc results .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "in previous studies  @xcite , the electronic structure of periodic rings of @xmath2 evenly spaced hydrogen atoms ( with a fixed distance of @xmath3  ) has been investigated .",
    "the number of hydrogen atoms is restricted to @xmath2 in order to obtain a possible closed - shell single - determinant solution with @xmath4 occupied orbitals .",
    "the symmetry - adapted hf wave function has a metallic character ( in the limit of an infinite ring ) and can be expressed with either delocalized canonical orbitals or localized wannier orbitals ( which do not have an exponential decay ) .",
    "the canonical orbitals , except for the lowest one , are doubly degenerate , and in a minimal basis the orbital coefficients are fixed by the cyclic symmetry . besides the symmetry - adapted ( sa ) solution , two different symmetry - broken hf solutions of lower energy can be obtained beyond critical ring sizes , when using unit cells of 2 hydrogen atoms .",
    "one solution corresponds to orbitals localized on hydrogen atoms and is referred to as the symmetry - broken atom - centered ( sb - ac ) solution , while the other corresponds to orbitals localized on bonds and is referred to as the symmetry - broken bond - centered ( sb - bc ) solution .",
    "the sb - bc solution has the lowest hf energy .",
    "the three solutions can be schematically described as @xmath5h@xmath5h@xmath5 , @xmath5h@xmath6h@xmath7 , and @xmath5h  h@xmath5 . in each case , the symmetry breaking is accompanied by an opening of an energy gap between occupied and virtual orbitals , and orbitals decay much more rapidly than for the symmetry - adapted solution  @xcite , in agreement with the theoretical result of kohn  @xcite .    in order to distinguish the three different wave functions ,",
    "one may look at the one - particle density matrix @xmath8 @xmath9 containing the coefficients @xmath10 of the occupied molecular orbitals @xmath11 , @xmath12 expanded in a minimal set of atom - centered basis functions , i.e.  one single basis function @xmath13 per hydrogen atom . as depicted in figure  [ densmat ] , for the sa solution , we see equal elements on the diagonal and the sub - diagonals of the density matrix . for the sb - ac solution ,",
    "an alternation of element values on the diagonal of the density matrix is obtained , but equal elements on the first sub - diagonal , and for the sb - bc solution we have equality of the diagonal elements and alternation on the first sub - diagonal .    in ref .  ,",
    "a minimal gaussian basis set ( five @xmath14 gaussian functions contracted to one single basis function for each hydrogen atom ) was used . however , gaussian basis functions are not appropriate for all - electron qmc calculations .",
    "they give large statistical fluctuations due to their incorrect vanishing gradient at the nuclear positions .",
    "it is thus much preferable to use slater basis functions which correctly have a non - zero gradient on the nuclei and an exponential decay at large distance . in this work",
    ", we use a minimal slater basis set ( one @xmath15 slater function on each hydrogen atom ) with an exponent of 1.17 , which is smaller than the optimal exponent of 1.24 for an isolated h@xmath16 molecule .",
    "spin - restricted hf ( and mp2 ) calculations were performed with an experimental code for ring systems , employed already for the previous studies  @xcite .",
    "the necessary integrals over slater functions have been calculated with the program smiles  @xcite . in order to obtain the symmetry - broken hf solutions , we start from a set of localized wannier orbitals describing either an ionic situation or an explicit bond in the two - atom unit cell , and use an iterative configuration interaction procedure using singly excited determinants  @xcite instead of diagonalizing a fock operator .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : hfmp2vmcdmc ]    figure  [ dmc ] shows the corresponding dmc results .",
    "the energy ordering is the same as in vmc and mp2 , the sa wave function giving the lowest dmc total energy , and thus the smallest fixed - node error .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab : hfmp2vmcdmc ] , the energy splittings between the different solutions are much smaller in dmc .",
    "this indicates that dmc is less sensitive to symmetry breaking than other correlation methods .",
    "it is an interesting feature for cases where symmetry breaking can not be avoided . of course ,",
    "symmetry breaking would probably be avoided if the orbitals were reoptimized in the presence of the jastrow factor within vmc , but this is computationally expensive for large systems .",
    "when hf trial wave functions are used in qmc calculations , in case of hf instabilities qmc faces the hf symmetry dilemma in choosing between the symmetry - adapted solution of higher hf energy and symmetry - broken solutions of lower hf energies . in this work ,",
    "we have examined the hf symmetry dilemma in hydrogen rings h@xmath0 which present hf singlet instabilities for sufficiently large ring sizes .",
    "we have shown that using a slater basis set , instead of a gaussian basis set , delays the onset of hf symmetry breaking until larger rings and slightly reduces the energy splittings between the symmetry - adapted and symmetry - broken wave functions .",
    "when using these different hf wave functions in vmc and dmc , we have found that the energy ordering is reversed ; the symmetry - adapted wave function always giving the lowest energy .",
    "this confirms previous post - hartree - fock studies in showing that these symmetry - broken solutions are bad starting wave functions for correlated calculations .",
    "the fact that the symmetry - adapted wave function gives the lowest dmc energy indicates that this wave function has more accurate nodes than the symmetry - broken wave functions .",
    "the present experience thus suggests that spatial symmetry is an important criterion for selecting good trial wave functions . for systems that are not very large , the symmetry - breaking problem",
    "could probably be avoided altogether by optimizing the orbitals within the quantum monte carlo calculation , rather than using fixed hf orbitals .",
    "this work has been financed mainly through the deisa network , project stop - qalm .",
    "all qmc calculations have been performed on the ibm bluegene machines in jlich and munich ( germany ) .",
    "c.j.u . was supported in part by the nsf ( grant nos .",
    "dmr-0908653 and che-1004603 ) .",
    "the authors thank the staff of idris ( orsay , france ) for technical assistance to install , test and run the qmc program champ on these machines .",
    "we also acknowledge using the slater integral code smiles ( madrid , spain ) for obtaining the hf starting wave functions .",
    "discussions with p. gori - giorgi ( amsterdam , netherlands ) and j .- p .",
