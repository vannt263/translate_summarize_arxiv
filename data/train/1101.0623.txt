    "this review article is concerned with a somewhat mysterious phenomenon known in the literature under the german name of `` zitterbewegung '' ( trembling motion ) .",
    "both the phenomenon and its name were conceived by erwin schrodinger who , in 1930 , published the paper _ ueber die kraeftefreie bewegung in der relativistischen quantenmechanik _ in which he observed that in the dirac equation , describing relativistic electrons in a vacuum , the @xmath0 operators corresponding to components of relativistic velocity do not commute with the free - electron hamiltonian  @xcite . in consequence ,",
    "the electron velocity is not a constant of the motion also in absence of external fields .",
    "such an effect must be of a quantum nature as it does not obey newton s first law of classical motion .",
    "schrodinger calculated the resulting time dependence of the electron velocity and position concluding that , in addition to classical motion , they experience very fast periodic oscillations which he called zitterbewegung ( zb ) .",
    "idea stimulated numerous theoretical investigations but no experiments since the predicted frequency @xmath1 mev and the amplitude of about @xmath2  are not accessible to current experimental techniques .",
    "huang  @xcite put the theory on a more physical basis calculating averages of velocity and position operators .",
    "it was recognized that the zb is due to an interference of states corresponding to the positive and negative electron energies resulting from the dirac equation  @xcite .",
    "lock  @xcite showed that , if an electron is represented by a wave packet , its zb has a transient character , i.e. it disappears with time .",
    "it was conceived years later that the trembling electron motion should occur also in crystalline solids if their band structure could be represented by a two - band model reminiscent of the dirac equation . the first paper in this line , published in 1970 by lurie and cremer  @xcite ,",
    "was concerned with superconductors , in which the energy - wave vector dependence is similar to the relativistic relation .",
    "similar approach was applied to semiconductors twenty years later using a model of two energy bands @xcite .",
    "however , an intense interest in zb of electrons in semiconductors was launched only in 2005 .",
    "zawadzki  @xcite used a close analogy between the @xmath3 theory of energy bands in narrow gap semiconductors ( ngs ) and the dirac equation for relativistic electrons in a vacuum to show that one should deal with the electron zb in ngs which would have much more favorable frequency and amplitude characteristics than those in a vacuum . on the other hand , schliemann _ et al . _",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the spin splitting of energies linear in  @xmath4 , caused by the inversion asymmetry in semiconductor systems ( the bychkov - rashba splitting ) , also leads to a zb - type of motion if the electron wave packet has a non - vanishing initial momentum .",
    "the above contributions triggered a wave of theoretical considerations for various semiconductor and other systems .",
    "it was recognized that the phenomenon of zb occurs every time one deals with two or more interacting energy bands  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that , indeed , when the electron is represented by a wave packet , the zb has a transient character  @xcite .",
    "considering graphene in a magnetic field it was demonstrated that , if the electron spectrum is discrete , zb contains many frequencies and it is sustained in time  @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out that the trembling electrons should emit electromagnetic radiation if they are not in their eigenstates  @xcite .",
    "the physical origin of zb was analyzed and it turned out that , at least in its `` classical '' solid state version analogous to the zb in a vacuum , the trembling motion represents simply oscillations of electron velocity due to the energy conservation as the particle moves in a periodic potential  @xcite .    as mentioned above , in a vacuum",
    "the zb characteristics are not favorable . in solids ,",
    "the zb characteristics are much better but it is difficult to observe the motion of a single electron",
    ". however , recently gerritsma _ et al . _",
    "@xcite simulated experimentally the dirac equation and the resulting electron zitterbewegung with the use of trapped ions and laser excitations .",
    "the power of the simulation method is that one can adjust experimentally the essential parameters of the dirac equation :  @xmath5 and  @xmath6 , and thus achieve more favorable values of the zb frequency and amplitude .",
    "the experimental results obtained by gerritsma _",
    "et al . _ agreed well with the predictions of zawadzki and rusin  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it turned out that analogues of zb can occur also in classical wave propagation phenomena .",
    "several predictions were made , but in two systems , namely macroscopic sonic crystals @xcite , and photonic superlattices  @xcite , the zb - like effects were actually observed .",
    "finally , there has been growing recognition that the mechanisms responsible for zb in solids are related to their other properties , for example to the electric conductivity .",
    "thus the subject of our interest is not only quickly developing but also quite universal . from an obscure , perplexing and somewhat marginal effect that would probably never be observed ,",
    "the zitterbewegung has grown into a universal , almost ubiquitous phenomenon that was experimentally simulated in its quantum form and directly observed in its classical version .",
    "our article summarizes the first five years of the intensive development which can be characterized as the `` sturm und drang '' period , to use another pertinent german term .",
    "we concentrate mostly on the zb in semiconductors but mention other systems , in particular different zb simulations by trapped ions and atoms , as these seem to be most promising for future experimental observations .",
    "we also briefly review important papers describing the zb of free relativistic electrons in a vacuum since they inspired early considerations concerning solids .",
    "the subject of zitterbewegung has been until now almost exclusively theoretical .",
    "below we quote mostly derivations and figures from our own papers , not because we believe that they are the only important ones , but because of the copyright restrictions .",
    "the review is organized in the following way . in sec .",
    "ii we present descriptions of zb for semi - relativistic , spin , and nearly - free electron hamiltonians and quote papers on other model systems .",
    "section iii treats the trembling motion in bilayer graphene , monolayer graphene and carbon nanotubes . in sec",
    "iv we consider the zb in the presence of an external magnetic field and quote related works .",
    "section v is concerned with the origin of zb in crystalline solids .",
    "there follows short section vi in which we mention work relating zb to calculations of electric conductivity . in sec",
    "vii we describe papers on the zb of free relativistic electrons , necessary to understand the trembling motion in solids .",
    "section viii contains a very brief introduction to simulations of the dirac equation and the resulting zb in absence of fields and in a magnetic field . the section is completed by summaries of related papers . in sec .",
    "ix we describe wave zb - like effects in non - quantum periodic systems . the review is terminated by discussion and conclusions .",
    "we begin our considerations of electron zb in semiconductors by using the so called relativistic analogy  @xcite . this way we can follow simultaneously the procedure of schrodinger and derive corresponding relations for narrow gap semiconductors .",
    "it was noted in the past that the  @xmath7 relation between the energy  @xmath8 and the wave vector  @xmath4 for electrons in ngs is analogous to that for relativistic electrons in a vacuum  @xcite .",
    "the semi - relativistic phenomena appear at electron velocities of @xmath9 cm / s , much lower than the light velocity  @xmath6 .",
    "the reason is that the maximum velocity  @xmath10 in semiconductors , which plays the role of  @xmath6 in a vacuum , is about @xmath11 cm / s . to be more specific",
    ", we use the @xmath3 approach to insb - type semiconductors  @xcite . taking the limit of of large spin - orbit energy",
    ", the resulting dispersion relation for the conduction and the light - hole bands is  @xmath12 , where @xmath13^{1/2}.\\ ] ] here  @xmath14 is the energy gap and  @xmath15 is the effective mass at the band edge .",
    "this expression is identical to the relativistic relation for electrons in a vacuum , with the correspondence @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the electron velocity  @xmath18 in the conduction band described by  ( [ e_2bands ] ) reaches a saturation value as  @xmath19 increases .",
    "this can be seen directly by calculating @xmath20 and taking the limit of large  @xmath21 , or by using the analogy @xmath22 .",
    "taking the experimental parameters  @xmath14 and  @xmath15 one calculates a very similar value of @xmath23 cm / s for different semiconductor compounds .",
    "now we define an important quantity @xmath24 which we call the length of zitterbewegung for reasons given below .",
    "we note that it corresponds to the compton wavelength @xmath25 for electrons in a vacuum .",
    "next we consider the band hamiltonian for ngs .",
    "it is derived within the model including  @xmath26 ( conduction ) ,  @xmath27 ( light and heavy hole ) , and  @xmath28 ( split - off ) bands and it represents an @xmath29 operator matrix  @xcite .",
    "we assume , as before , @xmath30 and omit the free electron terms since they are negligible for ngs .",
    "the resulting @xmath31 hamiltonian has  @xmath32 terms on the diagonal and linear  @xmath33 terms off the diagonal , just like in the dirac equation for free electrons .",
    "however , the three @xmath31 matrices  @xmath34 multiplying the momentum components  @xmath33 do not have the properties of @xmath0 dirac matrices , which considerably complicates calculations .",
    "for this reason , with only a slight loss of generality , we take @xmath35 and @xmath36 . in the  @xmath37 matrix ,",
    "two rows and columns corresponding to the heavy holes contain only zeros and they can be omitted .",
    "the remaining hamiltonian for the conduction and the light hole bands reads @xmath38 where  @xmath37 and  @xmath39 are the well - known @xmath0 dirac matrices  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian  ( [ h_wz ] ) has the form appearing in the dirac equation and in the following we can use the procedures of relativistic quantum mechanics ( rqm ) .",
    "the electron velocity is @xmath40=u\\hat{\\alpha}_3 $ ] .",
    "the eigenvalues of  @xmath37 are  @xmath41 , so that the eigenvalues of  @xmath42 are , paradoxically ,  @xmath43 . in order to determine  @xmath44 we calculate  @xmath45 by commuting  @xmath44 with  @xmath46 and integrating the result with respect to time .",
    "this gives  @xmath47 and we calculate  @xmath48 integrating again .",
    "the final result is @xmath49,\\ ] ] where @xmath50 .",
    "there is @xmath51 .",
    "the first two terms of  ( [ z(t ) ] ) represent the classical electron motion .",
    "the third term describes time dependent oscillations with the frequency of @xmath52 . since @xmath53 ,",
    "the amplitude of oscillations is @xmath54 . in rqm",
    "the analogous oscillations are called zitterbewegung , which explains the name given above to  @xmath55 . the expression obtained by schrodinger for zb of free relativistic electrons in a vacuum",
    "is identical to that given by  ( [ z(t ) ] ) with the use of the above relativistic analogy . in rqm",
    "it is demonstrated that zb is a result of interference between states of positive and negative electron energies  @xcite .",
    "clearly , one can say the same of zb in semiconductors calculated according to the above model .",
    "however , as we show below , the origin of zb in crystalline solids can be interpreted in more physical terms .",
    "the magnitude of  @xmath55 is essential .",
    "there is @xmath56  since , as mentioned above , @xmath57 cm / s for various materials .",
    "we estimate : for gaas ( @xmath58 ) @xmath59 , for inas ( @xmath60 ) @xmath61 , for insb ( @xmath62 ) @xmath63 .",
    "thus , in contrast to a vacuum , the length of zb in semiconductors can be quite large .",
    "however , one should bear in mind that the above derivations , as well as the original procedure of schrodinger s , use only operator considerations , whereas physical observables are given by quantum averages .",
    "we show below that , if one calculates such averages using electron wave packets , the amplitude of zb may be considerably smaller than  @xmath55 .",
    "next , we briefly consider another example of zb proposed by schliemann _",
    "et al . _",
    "it is based on the so - called bychkov - rashba ( br ) spin splitting caused by structure inversion asymmetry in two - dimensional semiconductor heterostructures  @xcite .",
    "the interaction describing this splitting is @xmath64 where  @xmath65 is the momentum of an electron confined in two - dimensional geometry , and  @xmath66 is the vector of pauli matrices .",
    "the coefficient  @xmath67 is to be calculated using details of the structure  @xcite .",
    "one can easily solve the eigenenergy equation and obtain the spin energies @xmath68 .",
    "the important difference with the case considered above is that here at  @xmath69 there is @xmath70 , i.e. there is no gap .",
    "the complete hamiltonian is @xmath71 , where  @xmath72 is the effective mass .",
    "the position operator in the heisenberg picture has the standard form @xmath73 one calculates @xmath74 explicitly using the hamiltonian and averages it employing a gaussian wave packet of the width d centered at the wave vector @xmath75 and @xmath76 . in case @xmath77 ,",
    "schliemann _ et al .",
    "_ obtained @xmath78.\\ ] ] the above result describes zb with the frequency given by @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the excitation energy between the two branches of the bychkov - rashba energies at @xmath81 .",
    "it is seen that zb is absent for @xmath82 .",
    "similar results for zb are obtained if , instead of the spin splitting due to structure inversion asymmetry , one uses a two - dimensional version of the spin splitting due to crystal inversion asymmetry ( dresselhaus splitting  @xcite ) described by the hamiltonian @xmath83    to demonstrate universality of zb in the two - band situation we consider the well - known case of nearly free electrons in which the periodic lattice potential @xmath84 is treated as a perturbation ( see  @xcite ) . near the brillouin zone boundary",
    "the hamiltonian has , to a good approximation , a @xmath85 form ( spin is omitted ) @xmath86 where @xmath87 are the fourier coefficients in the expansion of @xmath84 , and @xmath88 is the free electron energy .",
    "the @xmath85 quantum velocity  @xmath89 can now be calculated and the acceleration  @xmath90 is computed in the standard way .",
    "finally , one calculates the displacement matrix  @xmath91 .",
    "since the zb is by its nature not a stationary state but a dynamical phenomenon , it is natural to study it with the use of wave packets .",
    "these have become a practical instrument when femtosecond pulse technology emerged .",
    "thus , in a more realistic picture the electrons are described by wave packets @xmath92 the electron displacement is calculated as an average of the position operator  @xmath93 over the above wave packet , see figure  [ ngapfig2 ] and reference  @xcite .",
    "the essential result is that , in agreement with lock general predictions  @xcite , the zb oscillations of the average electron position have a _ transient _ character , i.e. they disappear with time on a femtosecond scale .",
    "the frequency of oscillations is @xmath94 , where @xmath95 .",
    "transient zitterbewegung oscillations of nearly - free electrons _ versus _ time , calculated for a very narrow wave packet centered at various  @xmath96 values .",
    "the band parameters correspond to gaas .",
    "after  @xcite.,width=302,height=302 ]    lurie and cremer  @xcite in their very early paper described zb of electrons in superconductors using the fact that a bogoliubov quasi - particle is described by a @xmath85 hamiltonian reminiscent of the dirac equation with finite gap .",
    "the resulting zb has a frequency corresponding to the gap and a large amplitude .",
    "however , this treatment was carried on the operator level without calculating physical averages .",
    "cannata _ et al . _",
    "@xcite in an early paper described a one - dimensional periodic chain using the tight - binding lcao scheme and observed that the resulting two - band model bears strong similarities to the dirac equation ( without spin ) . using the relativistic analogy this paper defined the effective `` rest mass '' , the effective `` compton wavelength '' and",

    "@xmath113 stands for the transpose of a vector , while  @xmath114 is the unit vector in spin space .",
    "one can use the hamiltonian  ( [ h_cserti ] ) to calculate time - dependent position operator in the heisenberg picture and show that it consists in general of the `` classical '' ( mean ) part and the zb part . for the bychkov - rashba coupling , see  ( [ h_cserti ] ) , and for monolayer graphene , see below , the zb can be interpreted as a consequence of conservation of the total angular momentum @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the orbital angular momentum .",
    "this is in analogy to the results discussed in section  v , where zb is shown to be a consequence of the energy conservation .",
    "david and cserti  @xcite considered a general multi - band hamiltonian and showed that in this case one deals with a trembling motion which is a superposition of trembling motions corresponding to all possible differences of energy eigenvalues .",
    "it was also shown , following remarks of  @xcite , that the zb amplitudes in the position operator are related to the berry connection matrix appearing in the expression of the berry phase .",

    "[ zittergrlfig1]a we show the zb of the electron position @xmath131 as given in  ( [ bg_x(t ) ] ) and  ( [ bg_xz(t ) ] ) .",
    "we enumerate the main features of zb following from  ( [ bg_x(t ) ] ) and  ( [ bg_xz(t ) ] ) .",
    "first , in order to have zb in the direction  @xmath132 one needs an initial transverse momentum  @xmath133 .",
    "second , the zb frequency depends only weakly on the packet width : @xmath134 , while its amplitude is strongly dependent on the width  @xmath108 .",
    "third , the zb has a transient character since it is attenuated by the exponential term . for small  @xmath135 the amplitude of  @xmath136 diminishes as @xmath137 with @xmath138 fourth ,",
    "as  @xmath135 ( or  @xmath139 ) increases , the cosine term tends to unity and the first term in  ( [ bg_xz(t ) ] ) cancels out with the second term , which illustrates the riemann - lebesgue theorem ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "after the oscillations disappear , the charge carrier is displaced by the amount  @xmath140 , which is a `` remnant '' of zb .",
    "fifth , for very wide packets ( @xmath141 ) the exponent in  ( [ bg_xz(t ) ] ) tends to unity , the oscillatory term is @xmath142 and the last term vanishes . in this limit one",

    "zitterbewegung of a charge carrier in bilayer graphene _ versus _ time , calculated for a gaussian wave packet width @xmath143  and @xmath144m@xmath145 : a ) position , b ) electric current , c ) dispersion @xmath146 .",
    "after the zb disappears a constant shift remains .",
    "after  @xcite.,width=321,height=321 ]    next , we consider other quantities related to zb , beginning by the current .",
    "the latter is given by the velocity multiplied by charge .",
    "the velocity is simply @xmath147 , where  @xmath148 is given by  ( [ bg_xz(t ) ] ) .",
    "the calculated current is plotted in figure  [ zittergrlfig1]b , its oscillations are a direct manifestation of zb .",
    "the transient character of zb is accompanied by a temporal spreading of the wave packet .",
    "in fact , the question arises whether the attenuation of zb is not simply _ caused _ by the spreading of the packet .",
    "the calculated packet width  @xmath149 is plotted versus time in figure  [ zittergrlfig1]c .",
    "it is seen that during the initial 80 femtoseconds the packet s width increases only twice compared to its initial value , while the zb disappears almost completely .",
    "we conclude that the spreading of the packet is _ not _ the main cause of the transient character of zb . looking for physical reasons behind the transient character of zb we decompose the total wave function @xmath150 into the positive  ( @xmath19 ) and negative  ( @xmath99 ) components @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "we have @xmath153 where @xmath154 and @xmath155 are the eigen - functions of the hamiltonian  ( [ bg_h ] ) in  @xmath156 space corresponding to positive and negative energies , respectively .",
    "further @xmath157 after some manipulations one obtains @xmath158 the function @xmath152 is given by the identical expression with the changed signs in front of  @xmath8 and @xmath159 terms .",
    "there is @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "now , one can calculate the average values of @xmath162 and @xmath163 using the positive and negative components in the above sense .",
    "we have @xmath164 so that we deal with four integrals .",
    "a direct calculation gives @xmath165 @xmath166 where @xmath140 and @xmath136 have been defined in  ( [ bg_x(t ) ] ) .",
    "thus the integrals involving only the positive and only the negative components give the constant shift due to zb , while the mixed terms lead to the zb oscillations .",
    "all terms together reconstruct the result  ( [ bg_x(t ) ] ) .",
    "next we calculate the average value  @xmath163 .",
    "there is no symmetry between  @xmath162 and  @xmath163 because the wave packet is centered around @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "the average value  @xmath163 is again given by four integrals .",
    "however , now the mixed terms vanish , while the integrals involving the positive and negative components give @xmath169 this means that the `` positive '' and `` negative '' subpackets move in the opposite directions with the velocity @xmath170 .",
    "the relative velocity is @xmath171 .",
    "each of these packets has the initial width  @xmath108 and it ( slowly ) spreads in time .",
    "after the time @xmath172 the distance between the two packets equals  @xmath108 , so the integrals  ( [ bg_x_mix ] ) are small , resulting in the diminishing zitterbewegung amplitude .",
    "this reasoning gives the decay constant @xmath173 , which is exactly what we determined above from the analytical results ( see  ( [ bg_gammaz ] ) ) .",
    "thus , _ the transient character of the zb oscillations is due to the increasing spatial separation of the subpackets _ corresponding to the positive and negative energy states .",
    "this confirms our previous conclusion that it is not the packet s slow spreading that is responsible for the attenuation .",
    "the separation of subpackets with the resulting decay of zb turns out to be a general feature of this phenomenon .",
    "now we turn to monolayer graphene .",
    "the two - dimensional band hamiltonian describing its band structure is  @xcite @xmath174 where @xmath175cm / s .",
    "the resulting energy dispersion is linear in momentum : @xmath176 , where @xmath177 . the quantum velocity in the schrodinger picture is @xmath178 , it does not commute with the hamiltonian  ( [ mg_h ] ) . in the heisenberg picture we have @xmath179",
    ". using  ( [ mg_h ] ) one calculates @xmath180 the above equation describes the trembling motion with the frequency @xmath181 , determined by the energy difference between the upper and lower energy branches for a given value of  @xmath4 . as before ,",
    "zb in the direction  @xmath132 occurs only if there is a non - vanishing momentum @xmath182 .",
    "one calculates an average velocity ( or current ) taken over a two - dimensional wave packet with nonzero initial momentum  @xmath183 .",
    "the results for the current @xmath184 are plotted in figure  [ zittergrlfig2 ] for different realistic packet widths  @xmath108 .",
    "it is seen that the zb frequency does not depend on  @xmath108 and is nearly equal to  @xmath185 given above for the plane wave . on the other hand ,",
    "the amplitude of zb does depend on  @xmath108 and we deal with decay times of the order of femtoseconds . for small  @xmath108",
    "there are almost no oscillations , for very large  @xmath108 the zb oscillations are undamped .",
    "these conclusions agree with our analytical results for bilayer graphene .",

    "the interband frequencies are characteristic of the zitterbewegung . the intraband ( cyclotron ) energies are due to the band quantization by the magnetic field and they do not appear in field - free situations .",
    "final calculations were carried out for a two - dimensional gaussian wave packet centered around the wave vector @xmath275 and having two non - vanishing components . in this case one can obtain analytical expressions for @xmath267 . the main frequency of oscillations is @xmath276 , which can be interpreted either as @xmath277 or @xmath278 for  @xmath279 .",
    "frequency @xmath280 belongs to the intraband ( cyclotron ) set , while  @xmath281 belongs to the interband set ( see figure  [ graphhfig1 ] ) .",
    "the striking feature is , that zb is manifested by several frequencies simultaneously .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that in graphene the energy distances between the landau levels diminish with  @xmath99 , which results in different values of frequencies  @xmath273 and  @xmath274 for different  @xmath99 .",
    "it follows that it is the presence of an external quantizing magnetic field that introduces various frequencies into zb .",
    "it turns out that , after the zb oscillations seemingly die out , they actually reappear at higher times . thus , _ for all @xmath183 values ( including @xmath75 ) , the zb oscillations have a permanent character _ , that is they do not disappear in time .",
    "this feature is due to the discrete character of the electron spectrum caused by a magnetic field .",
    "the above property is in sharp contrast to the no - field cases considered above , in which the spectrum is not quantized and the zb of a wave packet has a transient character . in mathematical terms , due to the discrete character of the spectrum , averages of operator quantities taken over a wave packet are sums and not integrals .",
    "the sums do not obey the riemann - lebesgues theorem for integrals which guaranteed the damping of zb in time for a continuous spectrum ( see  @xcite ) .",

    "the direction of movement is clockwise and the trajectories span early times ( 1ps ) after the creation of a wave packet .",

    "( 1 ) for @xmath286 the zb oscillation are permanent , while for  @xmath287 they are transient .",
    "the reason is that for @xmath286 the electron spectrum is discrete .",

    "( 3 ) for @xmath286 both interband and intraband ( cyclotron ) frequencies appear in zb ; for @xmath287 there are no intraband frequencies .",
    "( 4 ) magnetic field intensity changes not only the zb frequencies but the entire character of zb spectrum .    the zitterbewegung should be accompanied by electromagnetic dipole radiation emitted by the trembling electrons .",
    "the oscillations @xmath288 are related to the dipole moment @xmath289 , which couples to the electromagnetic radiation .",
    "one can calculate the emitted electric field from the electron acceleration @xmath290 and takes its fourier transform to determine the emitted frequencies . in figure  [ graphhfig6 ]",
    "we plot the calculated intensities of various emitted lines .",
    "the strong peak corresponds to oscillations with the basic frequency @xmath291 .",
    "the peaks on the high - frequency side correspond to the interband excitations and are characteristic of zb .",
    "the peaks on the lower frequency side correspond to the intraband ( cyclotron ) excitations . in absence of zb",
    "the emission spectrum would contain only the intraband ( cyclotron ) frequencies .",
    "thus the interband frequencies @xmath274 shown in figure  [ graphhfig6 ] are a direct signature of the trembling motion .",
    "it can be seen that the @xmath292 peaks are not much weaker than the central peak at @xmath291 , which means that there exists a reasonable chance to observe them .",
    "generally speaking , the excitation of the system is due to the nonzero momentum @xmath293 given to the electron .",
    "it can be provided by accelerating the electron in the band or by exciting the electron with a nonzero momentum by light from the valence band to the conduction band .",
    "the electron can emit light because the gaussian wave packet is not an eigenstate of the system described by the hamiltonian  ( [ h_pi0 ] ) .",

    "it was also demonstrated that in the presence of an external magnetic field the spin sub - packets rotate with different cyclotron frequencies .",
    "in spite of the great interest in the phenomenon of zb its physical origin remained mysterious .",
    "as mentioned above , it was recognized that the zb in a vacuum is due to an interference of states corresponding to positive and negative electron energies . since the zb in solids was treated by the two - band hamiltonian similar to the dirac equation , its interpretation was also similar .",

    "the second purpose is to decide whether the two - band * k.p * model of the band structure , used to describe the zb in solids , is adequate .",
    "one should keep in mind that we described above _ various kinds _ of zb .",
    "every time one deals with two interacting energy bands , an interference of the lower and upper states results in electron oscillations .",
    "in particular , one deals with zb related to the bychkov - rashba - type spin subbands  @xcite or to the luttinger - type light and heavy hole subbands  @xcite . however , the problem of our interest here is the simplest electron propagation in a periodic potential .",
    "the trembling motion of this type was first treated in  @xcite .",
    "it is often stated that an electron moving in a periodic potential behaves like a free particle characterized by an effective mass  @xmath72 .",
    "the above picture suggests that , if there are no external forces , the electron moves in a crystal with a constant velocity .",
    "this , however , is clearly untrue because the electron velocity operator @xmath297 does not commute with the hamiltonian @xmath298 , so that  @xmath299 is not a constant of the motion . in reality , as the electron moves in a periodic potential , it accelerates or slows down keeping its total energy constant .",
    "this situation is analogous to that of a roller - coaster : as it goes down losing its potential energy , its velocity ( i.e. its kinetic energy ) increases , and when it goes up its velocity decreases .",
    "we first consider the trembling frequency  @xmath185@xcite .",
    "the latter is easy to determine if we assume , in the first approximation , that the electron moves with a constant average velocity @xmath300 and the period of the potential is  @xmath301 , so @xmath302 . putting typical values for gaas : @xmath303 , @xmath304cm / s , one obtains @xmath305ev , i.e. the interband frequency since the energy gap is @xmath306ev .",
    "the interband frequency is in fact typical for the zb in solids .",

    "it is seen that the two - band * k.p * model gives an excellent description of zb for instantaneous velocities .",
    "this agreement demonstrates that the theories based on : ( a ) the periodic potential and ( b ) the band structure , describe _ the same _ trembling motion of the electron .",
    "the procedure based on the energy band structure is more universal since it also includes cases like the rashba - type spin subbands or the luttinger - type light and heavy hole subbands which do not exhibit an energy gap and do not seem to have a direct classical interpretation .",
    "the distinctive character of the situation we considered is that it has a direct spatial interpretation and it is in analogy to the situation first considered by schrodinger for a vacuum .",
    "the main conclusion of the above considerations is that the electron zitterbewegung in crystalline solids is not an obscure and marginal phenomenon but the basic way of electron propagation in a periodic potential .",
    "the zb oscillations of electron velocity are simply due to the total energy conservation .",
    "the trembling motion can be described either as a mode of propagation in a periodic potential or , equivalently , by the two - band * k.p * model of band structure .",
    "the latter gives very good results because , using the effective mass and the energy gap , it reproduces the main features of the periodic potential .",

    "paradoxically , these wave phenomena seem to be easier to observe than their `` older '' electronic analogues .",
    "an important recognition won after the considerable effort of the last five years is , that the zitterbewegung is not a marginal , obscure and probably unobservable effect of interest to a few esoteric theorists , but a real and universal phenomenon that often occurs in both quantum and non - quantum systems .",
    "clearly , the zb in a vacuum proposed by schrodinger  @xcite stands out as an exception since it is supposed to occur without any external force .",
    "however , in its original form it is probably not directly observable for year to come and one has to recourse to its simulations .",
    "a proof - of - principle of such simulations was recently carried out , see figure  [ gerritsmafig2 ] and reference  @xcite . on the other hand , manifestations of zb in crystalline",
    "solids and other periodic systems turned out to be quite common and they are certainly observable .",
    "a universal background underlying the phenomenon of zb in any system ( including a vacuum ) is an interference of states belonging to positive and negative energies ( in a generalized sense , see below ) .",
    "the positive and negative energies belong usually to bands but they can also be discrete levels , as shown for electrons in graphene in a magnetic field , see figure  [ graphhfig1 ] .    as we said above , the zb amplitude is around @xmath407 , which we called the length of zitterbewegung . let us suppose that we confine an electron to the dimension @xmath408 .",
    "then the uncertainty of momentum is @xmath409 and the resulting uncertainty of energy @xmath410 becomes @xmath411 .",
    "thus the electron confined to @xmath408 has the uncertainty of energy larger than the gap . for electrons in a vacuum the restriction @xmath412",
    "is not significant , but for electrons in narrow - gap semiconductors the restriction @xmath408 should be taken seriously since @xmath55 is of the order of tens of angstroms , so that this confinement is not difficult to realize experimentally by quantum wells or magnetic fields .",
    "the question arises , what happens if the electron is confined to @xmath413 , so that the trembling motion is strongly perturbed by the confinement .",
    "we showed above , see figure  [ graphhfig6 ] , that an electron in a magnetic field radiates interband zb frequencies and their contribution to the motion increases with the increasing field , see also  @xcite .",
    "it is possible that this effect is just a manifestation of the perturbation of the trembling motion by magnetic confinement .",
    "also , it was shown that an effective one - band semi - relativistic hamiltonian in a narrow - gap semiconductor contains the so - called darwin term which can be traced back to the zb .",
    "the darwin term can lead to measurable effects for ground impurity states  @xcite .",
    "an important question arises : what should be called `` zitterbewegung '' ?",
    "it seems that the signature of zb phenomenon is its _ interband frequency _ , in which the term _ interband _ has the meaning `` between interacting bands '' .",
    "thus , for example , the zb resulting from the bychkov - rashba spin splitting ( or the so - called linear dresselhaus spin splitting ) is not characterized by a truly interband frequency , since in this situation there is no gap , but the frequency corresponding to the energy difference between the two spin branches of the same band : @xmath414 , see  ( [ sch_x(t ) ] ) and reference  @xcite .",
    "another illustration is the zb of holes in the valence bands of @xmath27 symmetry  @xcite , where the zb frequency is given by the energy difference of light and heavy hole bands  @xcite .",
    "finally , an instructive example is provided by graphene in a magnetic field ( see figure  [ graphhfig1 ] ) , where the electron motion contains both intraband and interband frequencies .",
    "we believe that only the interband contributions should be called zb , while the intraband ones are simply the cyclotron components .",
    "it appears that the second signature of zb is the actual _ motion _ which , for instance , distinguishes it from the rabi oscillations .",
    "the above considerations indicate that an unambiguous definition of zb is not obvious .    if an electron is prepared in the form of a wave packet , and if the electron spectrum is not completely quantized , the zb has a _ transient _ character , i.e. it decays in time .",
    "this was predicted by lock  @xcite on the basis of the riemann - lebesgue lemma , and was confirmed by many specific calculations , see e.g. figures  [ zittergrlfig1 ] and  [ zittergrlfig2 ] , as well as by observations  @xcite .",
    "one can show that the decay time is inversely proportional to the momentum spread @xmath415 of the wave packet , see  ( [ bg_gammaz ] ) and references  @xcite .",
    "physically , the transient character of zb comes about as a result of waning interference of the two sub - packets belonging to positive and negative energies as they go apart because of different speeds , see  ( [ bg_psip ] ) and  ( [ bg_psin ] ) and references  @xcite .",
    "the decay time is usually much longer in one - dimensional systems , see figure  [ zittergrlfig3 ] and references  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if the electron spectrum is discrete , zb persists in time , sometimes in the form of collapse - revival patterns  @xcite . in general",
    ", the wave packet should have a non - vanishing initial momentum in one direction to exhibit the zb in the perpendicular direction see  ( [ sch_x(t ) ] ) and  ( [ bg_x_11 ] ) , but this is not always the case  ( @xcite ) .",
    "we described above the phenomena related to photons and phonons in separate section ix because , in our opinion , they are not simulations of the relativistic quantum mechanics but represent zb - like effects of their own .",
    "they are non - quantum wave effects in periodic structures . with the quantum electronic zb effects they have in common the floquet and mathieu descriptions of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the second - order differential equations with periodic potentials ,",
    "see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "quantum and non - quantum phenomena can be quite similar because of the wave character of quantum mechanics . it is an important success of the efforts concerned with the electronic zb that it has lead to the discoveries in non - electronic areas .",
    "it appears that , in fact , the non - electronic zb - like effects are easier to observe than the `` original '' electronic ones .",
    "finally , it is important that photons and phonons in the zb - like wave phenomena do not obey the pauli exclusion principle for fermions .",
    "clearly , one should ask the question about possible observation of zitterbewegung in solids .",
    "two different ways were proposed to observe the trembling electrons .",
    "the first is to detect an ac current related to the zb velocity , see e.g. figure  [ zittergrlfig2 ] .",
    "one needs a current meter sensitive to the zb frequency .",
    "then , even if the electrons do not move in phase so that the net current averages to zero , the meter should detect a clear increase of noise at the frequency  @xmath185 . the second possible way to observe",
    "the zb is to detect electromagnetic radiation emitted by the trembling electrons , see figure  [ graphhfig6 ] and reference  @xcite .",
    "the emission is possible because , if the electrons are prepared in form of wave packets or they respond to light wave packets , they are not in their eigenstates . the proposed zb should not be confused with the bloch oscillations of charge carriers in superlattices .",
    "the bloch oscillations are basically a one - band phenomenon and they require an external electric field driving electrons all the way to the brillouin zone boundary . on the other hand , the zb needs at least two bands and it is a no - field phenomenon .",
    "narrow gap superlattices can provide a suitable system for its observation . in the near future one can expect theoretical predictions of zb in new systems as well as observations of zb - like wave effects .",
