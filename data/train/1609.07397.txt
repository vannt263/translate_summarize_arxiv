    "optical parametric oscillators ( opos ) are optical cavities containing a crystal with second order nonlinearity .",
    "when pumped with a laser at frequency @xmath0 , these are able to generate beams at frequecies @xmath1 ( signal ) and @xmath2 ( idler ) such that @xmath3 , through the nonlinear process known as parametric down - conversion @xcite .",
    "classically , the generation of the down - converted field requires the nonlinear gain to compensate for the cavity losses , what means that the opo has to be pumped above a certain threshold power in order for signal and idler to start oscillating inside the cavity @xcite .",
    "quantum mechanically , on the other hand , down - converted pairs can be generated even below threshold , what confers the signal and idler fields with very interesting quantum correlations @xcite .",
    "in particular , type i opos , in which both signal and idler are linearly polarized within the extraordinary axis of the crystal , hold the record for quadrature noise reduction or single - mode squeezing ( more than 90% below vacuum fluctuations @xcite ) ; this is manifested in the mode at the degenerate frequency @xmath4 , but squeezing is large only when working close to threshold @xcite . as for the applications of this quantum - correlated light source , on one hand , squeezed light is a basic resource in the field of high - precission measurements , helping overcome the standard quantum limit imposed by vacuum fluctuations @xcite . on the other hand , mixing the output of two single - mode squeezers on a beam splitter , one can obtain a pair of entangled beams ( in the continuous - variable , einstein - podolsky - rosen sense @xcite ) , what makes these devices a basic resource also for continuous - variable quantum information protocols @xcite ; however , these method for the generation of entanglement requires the nonlinear cavities to be precisely locked to generate indistinguishable down - converted fields whose squeezing occurs in two orthogonal quadratures , which introduces one level of complexity .    of more interest for our current work",
    "are type ii opos , that is , opos in which signal and idler have orthogonal polarizations ( one following the extraordinary crystal axis , and the other one the ordinary ) , making the down - conversion intrinsically non - degenerate @xcite .",
    "just as the degenerate opo , there is an observable which shows large squeezing levels only close to threshold , which in this case corresponds to the sum of the phases of signal and idler ; in other words , close to threshold , type ii opos show signal - idler phase anticorrelations beyond the standard quantum limit @xcite . but non - degenerate opos have one more interesting property : they are invariant under changes of the signal - idler phase difference , what means that quantum noise is able to act on this variable without bounds , making it diffuse and eventually completely undetermined ( in the quantum mechanical sense ) @xcite .",
    "but , invoking now the heisenberg principle , a completely undetermined phase difference between signal and idler allows for complete noise reduction in their intensisty difference ( its canonically conjugate variable ) ; indeed , signal and idler become twin beams above threshold , that is , their amplitudes are perfectly correlated @xcite . hence , non - degenerate opos show ( ideally ) perfect amplitude correlations at any pumping level above threshold , and large phase anti - correlations close to threshold , which means that close to this point they should be in a high - quality continuous - variable entangled state reid89bis , reid89,drummond90,navarretephd . from a quantum optics perspective , this means that below threshold opos should emit a two - mode squeezed vacuum state , while above threshold opos would emit a displaced one ( a ` bright ' epr state ) .    however , there are two issues that make above - threshold type ii opos not practical as an epr source , specially from a detection point of view .",
    "first , the phase  matching conditions ensuring that it is the frequency degenerate process the one with larger gain ( lowest threshold ) are quite critical , and hence , signal and idler will have different frequencies in general ; for example , in the case of @xcite , where the authors are able to make the frequency difference between signal and idler as small as 150 for a cavity with 8 free spectral range and 6 linewidth , variations of the cavity length on the order of the nanometer can make the oscillation frequencies jump to frequencies separated by several times the free spectral range ( mode hopping ) ; second , the signal - idler phase - difference is chosen at random at any realization and diffuses with time ( rather fast close to threshold ) , making it virtually impossible to capture the squeezed quadratures in a balanced homodyne detection scheme .",
    "hence , additional signal - idler phase locking techniques are required .",
    "the pioneering example of such locking techniques was introduced by claude fabre and collaborators @xcite . their idea consisted in embedding in the cavity a @xmath5 plate with its fast axis misaligned with respect to the extraordinary axis of the nonlinear crystal .",
    "the plate introduces a coupling between the signal and idler modes which breaks the phase invariance of the opo , and it was then shown in longchambon04a that in a given region of the parameter space ( in particular of the detunings ) the frequencies of signal and idler get locked to @xmath6 ; this opo is known as the _ self  phase  locked opo _ , and was already studied experimentally in laurat05 .",
    "note that , as mentioned , this self  locking effect is accomplished by breaking the phase symmetry of the opo , and hence , one should expect a degradation of the signal - idler intensity correlations , or , equivalently , of the noncritical squeezing induced by spontaneous polarization symmetry breaking described in @xcite",
    ". for example , in @xcite the intensity  difference fluctuations showed 89% quantum noise reduction prior to the introduction of the plate , while after obtaining frequency degeneracy through the self  phase ",
    "locking mechanism this value fell down to a more humble 65% .    in the present article",
    "we study an alternative locking mechanism which consists in the injection of a laser at frequency degeneracy @xmath6 , what is less invasive and more controlable at real time than the introduction of a @xmath5 wave plate ; we will call _ actively  phase  locked opo _ to such opo configuration .",
    "we show how locking of the signal and idler frequencies to the subharmonic @xmath7 can be achieved , while still obtaining large entanglement levels .",
    "this locking technique is reminiscent of our previous work in frequency - degenerate type i opos tuned to the first family of transverse modes @xcite , in which we proposed injecting a tem@xmath8 mode at the subharmonic to lock the phase - difference between the down - converted modes with opposite orbital angular momentum @xcite .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce our opo model , providing the set of stochastic equations within the positive p representation which will allow us to study both its classical and quantum dynamics in detail . particularizing to a configuration that we will denote by ` symmetric ' ,",
    "next we find the classical phase diagram of the system analytically , showing the regimes where frequency locking is expected to appear .",
    "still within this symmetric configuration , we then provide analytical expressions for the quantum correlations of the system , putting special emphasis on the level of signal - idler entanglement at the locking points . in the section before the conclusions ,",
    "we move out of the symmetric configuration , which is quite challenging to achieve in real experiments , and perform a numerical study that proves all the analytic conclusions of the symmetric case to hold also in this case .    , and three resonances around the subharmonic @xmath7 , two of which overlap at that frequency and correspond to the signal and idler down - converted modes .",
    "for definiteness and without loss of generality , we consider a symmetric fabry - perot cavity with a thin nonlinear crystal in its center ( @xmath9 ) , where the electric field operator at the relevant frequencies can be approximately written as @xmath10 , with @xcite @xmath11 the indices ` p ' , ` s ' , and ` i ' refer to the pump , signal , and idler modes , respectively .",
    "@xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are , respectively , the resonance frequency , crystal s refractive index , optical cavity length , transverse spot size at the cavity waist , and polarization of the corresponding mode .",
    "@xmath17 is the transverse coordinate vector , with @xmath18 , and we have assumed there are tem@xmath19 transverse modes resonating at the three relevant frequencies , giving rise to the simple gaussian transverse profile of the expression .",
    "finally , let us remark that , starting from the schrodinger picture , we work in a new picture rotating at frequency @xmath0 for the pump , and @xmath6 for signal and idler , so that the the annihilation ( @xmath20 ) and creation ( @xmath21 ) operators in the expression are time - independent ( only the state of the system will be time - dependent ) , and satisfy canonical commutation relations @xmath22=\\delta_{jl}$ ] .",
    "the resonance scheme and polarization of the fields are sketched in fig .",
    "[ ftypeii1 ] : the pump is polarized within the ordinary axis of the crystal and resonates at frequency @xmath0 , while , by convention , signal and idler are polarized within the extraordinary and ordinary axis , respectively , and resonate at frequencies @xmath23 , with @xmath24 smaller or on the order of their cavity linewidth @xmath25 , taken equal for signal and idler for simplicity . apart from pumping the cavity with a laser at frequency @xmath0 with ordinary polarization , we inject an external laser field ( in phase with the pump drive ) at the degenerate frequency @xmath6 with polarization @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are unit vectors following , respectively , the extraordinary and ordinary axes of the crystal . including cavity losses through the usual lindblad terms , the master equation governing the evolution of the state of the system reads @xcite @xmath29 + \\sum_{j=\\mathrm{p , s ,",

    "in addition , the injection parameters can be approximately written in terms of the power @xmath35 of the injected lasers at frequencies @xmath0 and @xmath6 as @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , where we have taken the phase of the driving lasers as a reference .    in order to get analytical insight , and following previous works @xcite",
    ", we map this master equation into a set of stochastic langevin equations by using the positive @xmath39 coherent representation @xcite .",
    "this is an exact procedure by which an independent complex stochastic variable is associated to each bosonic operator , that is , @xmath40 to @xmath41 ; quantum expectation values of any operator are then obtained as stochastic averages by replacing the bosonic operators by their corresponding stochastic variable in the normally - ordered version of the operator .",
    "it is not difficult to show @xcite that the stochastic langevin equations associated to the master equation ( [ mastereq ] ) read    @xmath42    where we have defined independent complex noises @xmath43 and @xmath44 , with zero mean , and only non - zero two - time correlators    @xmath45    in order to reduce the number of parameters of the problem , we now make some variable changes ; in particular , we redefine time as @xmath46 , the coherent amplitudes as @xmath47and the noises as@xmath48which satisfy the statistical properties ( [ complexnoisecorr ] ) , but now respect to the dimensionless time @xmath49 . in terms of these new variables ,",
    "the langevin equations read    [ normlangevin ] @xmath50where we have defined the parameters    @xmath51    note that the fokker - planck equation associated to this langevin system is independent of @xmath52 , and hence , we can ignore the phase factors in the noises .",
    "in other words , the system is only sensitive to the parameter @xmath53 of the injection s polarization .        in order to get some analytic insight in the rest of the article ( with the exception of the last section ) we are going to simplify the problem to what we will call _ symmetric configuration _ of the actively  phase  locked opo : we assume the detunings to be opposite , that is , @xmath54 , and inject with @xmath55 ( arbitrary polarization ellipse along the @xmath56 axis ) , so that signal and idler get equally pumped , @xmath57 .",
    "furthermore , we consider the @xmath58 limit in which the pump can be adiabatically eliminated ( @xmath59 in the previous equations ) . taking all these considerations into account",
    ", we can reduce our model equations ( [ normlangevin ] ) to    [ finallangevin ] @xmath60with @xmath61 and @xmath62    these are the final equations that will model quantum - mechanically our system in the remaining of the paper . in this work we are interested in the quantum properties of the down - converted field . in particular , defining a polarization mode    @xmath63/\\sqrt{2},\\ ] ]    where we include in the definition the phase @xmath64 of the injection beam for later convenience , with associated annihilation operator@xmath65/\\sqrt{2},\\ ] ] we will be interested in the noise spectrum associated to one of its quadratures @xmath66 , which can be obtained as    @xmath67    where @xmath68 is the so - called noise frequency ( normalized to @xmath69 ) , and @xmath70 is the stochastic variable accounting for the quadrature associated to the normalized stochastic amplitudes    @xmath71    we have also introduced the notation @xmath72 .",
    "this noise spectrum is the quantity usually measured in a homodyne detection of the field coming out of the cavity when the local oscillator matches the spatio - temporal profile of the down - converted field , and has polarization @xmath73 and phase @xmath74 relative to the pump .",
    "quantum correlations are manifest whenever @xmath75 for some value of the parameters , in which case we say that quadrature @xmath76 is squeezed at noise frequency @xmath68 .",
    "let us finally remark that in the following we will use the notation @xmath77  and  @xmath78 when needed .",
    "let us first analyze the classical behavior of the system , which will allow us to see the regions of the parameter space where the signal and idler oscillation frequencies get locked .",
    "the classical limit can be retrieved by making a coherent - state ansatz for all fields , whose amplitude plays the role of the ( normalized ) amplitude of the classical electromagnetic fields . within the positive _ p _ representation ,",
    "this is equivalent to replacing the ` plus ' amplitudes by the corresponding complex - conjugate ones and setting the noises to zero , leading to    [ injopoeqsnorm ] @xmath79 the oscillation frequency of the classical fields @xmath80 will be locked to @xmath81 whenever this nonlinear system has a stationary solution , see eq .",
    "( fields ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the symmetry @xmath82 of these equations suggests looking for stationary solutions of the type    @xmath83    in the remaining of this section we study the conditions under which this type of solutions exist and are stable .",
    "first , it is straightforward to show from ( [ injopoeqsnorm ] ) that the intensity @xmath84 of this _ symmetric solution _ satisfies the third order polynomial@xmath85i ,   \\label{ipol}\\ ] ] with its phase @xmath86 uniquely determined from @xmath84 as @xmath87 .",
    "depending on the parameters , this polynomial can have one or three positive definite solutions ( see fig .",
    "ftypeii2 ) ; by solving the equation @xmath88 , it is simple to show that the turning points @xmath89 have the expression@xmath90 and hence , they exist only for @xmath91 . for @xmath92",
    "the solution is therefore single - valued .    in order to analyze the stability of this symmetric solution , we will change to a new polarization basis @xmath93 and @xmath94 where @xmath95 corresponds to the polarization mode excited by the symmetric solution ( [ symmsol ] ) and @xmath96 to its orthogonal , that is , to what we will call the _ bright _ and _ dark _ modes of the system , as we did in previous works @xcite .",
    "the corresponding normalized amplitudes satisfy the evolution equations    @xmath97    in this new basis the symmetric solution ( [ symmsol ] ) simply reads @xmath98 @xmath99 and its associated stability matrix is    @xmath100    the characteristic polynomial of this stability matrix can be factorized into two second order polynomials , namely @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "the bifurcation diagrams for the different parameter regions are shown in fig .",
    "[ ftypeii2 ] ; now we discuss them in length .",
    "let us start by studying the instabilities predicted by the first polynomial , whose roots are given by@xmath103 the condition @xmath104 can only be satisfied for@xmath105 the fact that the instability appears without imaginary part in @xmath106 , and it is located in the upper branch of the s  shaped curve ( @xmath107 for any value of the parameters ) , signals that it corresponds to a pitchfork or static bifurcation where an asymmetric stationary solution with @xmath108 borns ( as we have checked numerically , see the grey lines in fig .",
    "[ ftypeii2 ] ) .",
    "this bifurcation is similar to the one introduced in @xcite , where we studied the effects of a signal injection in the two - transverse - mode dopo , and can be understood as a switching on of the dark mode .",
    "however , note that in this case the fluctuations of the bright and dark modes are not decoupled below threshold , see the linear stability matrix ( [ lbd ] ) , what physically means that the quantum properties of the dark mode at the bifurcation will be different from those of the dark mode in @xcite , and hence no perfect squeezing is likely to be found , as we show later .    as for the second polynomial , its roots",
    "are given by@xmath109 note that @xmath110 for @xmath111 , that is , the turning points of the s  shaped curve correspond to bifurcation points .",
    "it is then simple to check ( for example numerically ) that the whole middle branch connecting this instability points is unstable , a characteristic trade of intensity - bistable systems ( see figs . [",
    "ftypeii2]c , d ) .",
    "but @xmath112 has yet one more instability when @xmath113 provided @xmath114 . at this instability",
    "the eigenvalues become purely imaginary , in particular , @xmath115 with @xmath116 , and hence it corresponds to a hopf bifurcation .",
    "it is simple to check that @xmath117 is always below @xmath118 and @xmath119 ; in particular , it borns at @xmath120 for @xmath121 , and climbs the @xmath122 curve as @xmath123 increases until it dies at @xmath124 for @xmath125 ( see figs .",
    "[ ftypeii2]b , c , d ) .",
    "the portion of the curve with @xmath126 is unstable , and no stationary solutions can be found there , as the stable states correspond in this case to periodic orbits ( as we have checked numerically , see figs .",
    "[ ftypeii2]b , c , d ) .",
    "this is also quite intuitive because , when no injection is present ( @xmath127 ) , we know that the stable states of the opo above threshold are the ones with the signal and idler beams oscillating at the non - degenerate frequencies @xmath128 and @xmath129 , which in the picture we are working on means @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "this analysis proves that there exist regions in the parameter space where the frequencies of the signal and idler beams are locked to the degenerate one , and hence active  locking can be a good alternative to the self - locking technique already proposed for type ii opos @xcite .",
    "as explained in the introduction , in the absence of subharmonic injection ( @xmath127 ) , it is well known that there is perfect entanglement between the signal and idler modes for @xmath121 within the linearized description ; above this threshold , the entanglement level is degraded ( although perfect amplitude correlations persist ) , and the signal and idler fields start oscillating at different frequencies . our main intention with the injection was to lock these frequencies to the degenerate one , @xmath7 , which should contribute to make the observation and use of their entanglement simpler , since we will show the entanglement to be equivalent to squeezing in a couple of modes with well defined frequency and orthogonal polarization .",
    "we expect the presence of the injection to degrade the entanglement level , since it breaks the phase invariance of the opo , and in this section we are going to evaluate how fragile the entanglement is to this injection , proving that large entanglement can still be attained .    in order to analyze the quantum properties of the system ,",
    "let us first move again to the basis defined by the bright and dark modes , @xmath93 and @xmath132 .",

    "indeed , whenever the condition    @xmath155    is satisfied for some phases @xmath156 and @xmath157 , it implies that the state of signal and idler is not separable @xcite , which in our case is achieved because the quadratures @xmath158 are squeeezed , as we pshow next .",

    "[ ftypeii3 ] we show the zero - frequency noise spectrum of these squeezed quadratures @xmath167 evaluated in the aforementioned critical points as a function of the pump injection @xmath123 , and for three different values of the detuning @xmath146 .",
    "note that large levels of squeezing are obtained in the hopf bifurcation even when working up to 20% above threshold ( @xmath168 ) .",
    "another interesting point is the pitchfork bifurcation in which the symmetric solution disappears in favor of another stationary , asymmetric solution , see fig .",
    "[ ftypeii2 ] . as we already pointed out ,",
    "in contrast to the injected two - transverse - mode dopo @xcite , we expect perfect squeezing not to appear at this bifurcation , because the fluctuations of the dark mode are not decoupled from those of the bright mode below the corresponding threshold . nevertheless , we prove in this section that large squeezing levels are still attainable .",
    "the first thing to note in this case is that it is more convenient to analyze the squeezing properties in the polarization basis @xmath169 , where @xmath170 .",
    "as shown in appendix [ appendixsym ] , in this basis we get the zero - noise frequency noise spectra    [ voutpb ] @xmath171    in this case the @xmath164 quadrature of the @xmath172 mode is perfectly anti - squeezed ; its complementary , the @xmath173 quadrature of the same mode , is not perfectly squeezed , but it shows very high noise reduction , as shown in fig .",
    "[ ftypeii5]a .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath174 polarization mode shows also noise reduction in its @xmath173 quadrature , although the squeezing levels are quite modest in this case , see fig .",
    "[ ftypeii5]b .",
    "we can understand much better the dependence of these spectra on the parameters by performing expansions to the leading order in the detuning ( note in particular that the one corresponding to the @xmath174 is independent of the detuning ) :    @xmath175    note finally that , in this polarization basis , the steady - state solution reads @xmath176 , and hence , in both cases we obtain amplitude squeezing , contrary to what happens at the locking points .",
    "in order to get analytical insight , in the previous sections we have focused in the case in which signal and idler are detuned symmetrically with respect to the subharmonic injection at frequency @xmath7 . in real experiments , however , it is extremely challenging to meet such a symmetric configuration , since it requires unfeasible fine - tuning .",
    "hence , in order for our locking method to be of use , it is important to study whether our predictions persist when working out of such a symmetric situation , and this is what we prove in this section .",
    "the main difficulty when working out of the symmetric configuration is that we do not have an analytic solution and stability analysis to rely on , and hence , we need to resort to numerical tools . using these",
    ", we will show though that the hopf instability is still present in the asymmetric case , as well as large levels of entanglement between signal and idler .",
    "our starting point is again the normalized equations in which the pump has been adiabatically eliminated , eqs .",
    "( [ finallangevin ] ) , but allowing for general signal and idler detuning , which amounts to replace @xmath146 by @xmath177 in eqs .",
    "( [ normeqs1 ] ) and ( [ normeqs2 ] ) , and by @xmath178 in eqs .",
    "( [ normeqs3 ] ) and ( [ normeqs4 ] ) .",
    "the first step consists in finding the classical configuration of the system , what we do numerically in this case .",
    "in particular , we first check that even in this asymmetric configuration , the classical version of this equations still possess a hopf bifurcation above threshold ( @xmath179 ) . to this aim , at a given value of the pump parameter @xmath123 , we start from an injection @xmath160 large enough so that the system reaches a stationary solution @xmath180 , and then decrease the injection gradually until the real part of one of the eigenvalues of the linear stability matrix gets as close to zero as we desire , checking that the imaginary part of the eigenvalue is non - zero .",
    "this proves that the hopf instability is still present in this asymmetric case , and , moreover , we have checked that if we keep decreasing the injection , periodic orbits are found as the asymptotic solution of the system .",
    "hence , again we see that above threshold it is required a minimum value of the injection to lock the signal and idler frequencies .",
    "once we have identified the hopf bifurcation , which we remind it is the natural locking point of the system , we compute its quantum properties by linearizing the langevin equations , similarly to the symmetric case .",
    "however , in this case we find the eigensystem of the linear stability matrix numerically for each parameter set .",
    "as explained in detail in appendix [ appendixasym ] , from this eigensystem we can compute the output field s spectral covariance matrix in the signal / idler basis , and compute from it the logarithmic negativity quantifying the entanglement between these two modes following standard gaussian techniques @xcite .",
    "we provide all the details in appendix [ appendixasym ] as well , and here we just want to compare these levels to the ones obtained in the symmetric case . in order to do this , we proceed as follows . for every value of the pump parameter @xmath123 , we choose some distance between the signal and idler resonances ,",
    "say @xmath181 . in the symmetric case , this means that we choose @xmath182 . on the other hand , as a highly asymmetric case we choose @xmath183 and @xmath184 . in fig .",
