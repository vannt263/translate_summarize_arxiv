    "model identification is an important method used in both fundamental and applied research  @xcite on the human cardiovascular system ( cvs ) .",
    "because of the complexity of cvs dynamics and the multiplicity of its mechanism , it is inherently difficult or impossible to isolate and study individual response mechanisms in the intact organism  @xcite . in such cases mathematical models of cardiovascular control that are consistent with the experimental data",
    "can provide valuable insights  @xcite .",
    "altered dynamics of the cardiovascular system is associated with a range of cardiovascular diseases and with increased mortality , and it is hoped that dynamical metrics will provide new means of evaluating autonomic activity , and eventually form the basis for diagnostic tests for many conditions ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "despite the fact that most cardiovascular controls are demonstrably nonlinear  @xcite and are perturbed by stochastic inputs  @xcite , oversimplified assumptions of model linearity  @xcite and/or determinism  @xcite are often made in order to make some progress in cardiovascular system identification .",
    "such choices are often influenced more by the availability of certain statistical tools and methodologies than by biophysical or medical considerations .",
    "it is very desirable to develop reliable methods of system identification that do not have such limitations , and are capable of treating more realistic models .",
    "such models could be used to relate difficult - to - access parameters to non - invasively - measured data  @xcite .",
    "while a number of numerical schemes have been proposed recently to deal with different aspects of the inverse problem using linear approximations  @xcite , or semi - quantitative estimations of either the strength of some of the nonlinear terms  @xcite or the directionality of coupling  @xcite , inverse cardiovascular inverse problems remain difficult because of the complexity and nonlinearity of the cardiovascular interactions , as well as the stochasticity of many dynamical inputs to the system .",
    "the problem of nonlinear cardiovascular system identification has been addressed in a number of publications  @xcite .",
    "nonlinearities generally require the use of more complex and involved numerical techniques  @xcite , while the presence of dynamical noise in continuous systems can introduced systematic errors in the estimation of the model parameters  @xcite .",
    "analogous difficulties arise in a broad range of problems in many scientific disciplines , including problems in lasers @xcite and molecular motors @xcite , in epidemiology @xcite , and in coupled matter  radiation systems in astrophysics @xcite .",
    "an obstacle to progress in these fields is the lack of general methods of dynamical inference for stochastic nonlinear systems .",
    "accordingly the methods described in this paper should be of broad interdisciplinary interest .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a novel method for the analysis of cardiorespiratory dynamics within a nonlinear bayesian framework for the inference of stochastic dynamical systems  @xcite .",
    "this method is applied to the analysis of a univariate blood pressure time - series where a simple nonlinear dynamical model based on coupled nonlinear oscillators  @xcite . is found that describes time - series data in the relevant frequency range .",
    "the accuracy of the method is investigated using surrogate data with parameters close to the parameters inferred in the experiment , and the connection of this model to a well - known beat - to - beat model of the baroreflex is discussed .",
    "in the methodological framework presented here there are three essential steps : ( i ) the input data is prepared , ( ii ) a parameterized class of models chosen that describes the data , and ( iii ) the parameters of this model are inferred from the time - series data .      here",
    "we worked with a particular recording of the central venous blood pressure , a sample of which is shown in the fig .",
    "[ filters](a ) .",
    "a feature this blood pressure ( bp ) time - series is the presence of the two oscillatory components at frequencies approximately @xmath0 hz and @xmath1 hz corresponding to the respiratory and cardiac oscillations .",
    "it can also be clearly seen from the spectra that the nonlinear terms including terms of nonlinear cardiorespiratory interaction ( corresponding to the side peaks ) are very visible in this sample .",
    "we note that the relative intensity and position of the cardiac and respiratory components vary strongly from sample to sample with average frequency of the respiration being around @xmath2 hz and of the heart beat being around @xmath3 hz .        in preparing cardiovascular data for model identification one",
    "has to bear in mind that the cvs power spectra reflect a large variety of complex cardiovascular interactions seen as peaks and other features in a very broad frequency range  @xcite . in order to make sense of these multi - scale phenomena parametric",
    "modelling is usually restricted to a specific part of the power spectrum .",
    "it is clear that in modelling the cardiorespiratory interaction the frequency range of modelling must include at least main harmonics of cardiac and respiratory oscillations @xmath4 and @xmath5 and their combinational frequencies .",
    "moreover , as was pointed out already by womersley ( see e.g.  @xcite cf . also with  @xcite ) locally measured blood pressure signals resembles a steady - state oscillations and the sum of the first three harmonics contains more then 70% of the total signal variance .",
    "therefore , it is desirable that at least three harmonics ( see also discussion below ) of the basic frequencies of the respiratory and cardiac oscillations are included into the frequency range of modelling .",
    "when one considers modelling the cardiovascular system , one usually envisions constructing a model based on biophysical principles that is capable of generating solutions that reproduce , to some degree , the data : the _ forward modelling _ problem ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "one may also consider the _",
    "inverse modelling _ problem , in which models are built that describe measured data ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . both approaches have proven useful in the context of the cardiovascular research with forward approach providing valuable insight into the system and its causal relationships , and the inverse approach providing a useful means of intelligent patient monitoring of cardiovascular function .    as a third alternative",
    "one may try to bridge the two approaches by building a model that accurately reproduces the experimental observations while at the same time is based on the biophysical principles of circulation .",
    "in such a case the form of the mathematical model is taken from biophysical principles , with its component parts corresponding to a greater or lesser degree to specific biophysical mechanisms , while the values of some or all of the parameters of the mathematical model are inferred directly from from the data .",
    "in such a case it is to be hoped that information with direct biophysical significance , and not mere mathematical or statistical characterizations can be inferred from the data .",
    "many studies have been carried out to explore the physiological mechanisms underlying cardiorespiratory interactions  @xcite .",
    "the most important ones are the modulation of cardiac filling pressure by respiratory movements  @xcite , the direct respiratory modulation of parasympathetic and sympathetic neural activity in the brain stem  @xcite , and the respiratory modulation of the baroreceptor feedback control  @xcite .",
    "a common feature that these mechanisms is that they are nonlinear , have a dynamical ( or memory ) component , and are subject to exogenous fluctuations  @xcite .    a simple beat - to - beat model describing the cardio - respiratory systems deboer et al .",
    "the deboer model has further been elaborated recently in  @xcite .",
    "insight into cardio - respiratory dynamics can also be gained through inverse modelling where the cardiac and respiratory cycles are modelled in terms of coupled nonlinear oscillators  @xcite . in this approach",
    "spectral and synchronization features observed in the time - series data are interpreted physiologically , and related to the model parameters  @xcite .",
    "however , the identification of the model parameters could not be inferred directly from the time - series data .",
    "instead an extensive computer simulations have been employed to establish realistic values for the model parameters  @xcite .",
    "the simplest model that could reproduce steady - state oscillations of the blood pressure signal at two fundamental frequencies is a system of two coupled limit cycles on a plane . according to the results of the poincar@xmath6-bendixson theory of planar dynamical systems for a system to have limit cycle in a simply connected region",
    "the divergence of the vector field must change sign in this region ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude , that the simplest system that can reproduced the discussed features of the bp signal is planar systems with limit cycles which vector field contains polynomials of the order 3 . accordingly , we model the time - series data as a system of two coupled oscillators with vector fields including nonlinearities ( including nonlinearities in coupling terms ) up to the 3-rd order in the form @xmath7 here noise matrix @xmath8 mixes zero - mean white gaussian noises @xmath9 , which is related to the diffusion matrix @xmath10 . and",
    "base functions are chosen in the form @xmath11     summary of the main harmonics of the cardiac and respiratory components observed in the bp signal .",
    "the correspondence between the nonlinear terms of the model ( [ eq:2vdp_1 ] ) , ( [ eq:2vdp_2 ] ) and the frequencies observed in the time - series data are shown by arrows.,width=264 ]    the restrictions imposed on the rhs of the equations for @xmath12 and @xmath13 in ( [ eq:2vdp_1 ] ) and ( [ eq:2vdp_2 ] ) are determined mainly by the fact that we have to infer four hidden dynamical variables using univariate time - series data ( see next section for further details ) .",
    "the parametric representation ( [ eq:2vdp_1 ] ) and ( [ eq:2vdp_2 ] ) covers a wide range of models with limit cycles in the plane .",
    "in particular , with a special choice of the model parameters it describes van der pol or fitzhugh - nagumo oscillator systems that are very popular in the context of the cardiovascular modelling .",
    "furthermore , the choice of the parametric model in the form ( [ eq:2vdp_1 ] ) and ( [ eq:2vdp_2 ] ) allows one to relate them to physiological parameters characterizing autonomous nervous system ( see section [ s : discussion ] for the discussion ) .",
    "see @xcite for the alternative choice and corresponding physiological reasoning .",
    "following the logic of the inverse modelling approach , we must then identify the parameters @xmath14 of the model ( [ eq:2vdp_1 ] ) , ( [ eq:2vdp_2 ] ) that reproduce the dynamical and spectral features of the bp signal shown in the fig .",
    "terms representing nonlinear cardio - respiratory interactions are described by the last three base functions in ( [ eq : basis ] ) .",
    "the correspondence of these terms to the experimentally observed combinational frequencies in the bp signal is summarized in the fig .",
    "[ fig : summary ] .",
    "it can be seen from the figure that the same combinational frequencies correspond to the nonlinear coupling terms in both limit cycle systems in the model therefore a _ nonlinear _ time - series analysis is a requirement for the identification of such a model .",
    "here we show how the task of identifying a model of the cardiovascular system based on coupled nonlinear oscillators can be performed systematically within a bayesian statistical framework . in this",
    "approach parameters of the model can be inferred directly from the time - series data .",
    "we also discuss briefly how the links between the coupled oscillator model and beat - to - beat models can in principle be established .",
    "details of our new bayesian technique can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "here we give a brief description of the main steps of the algorithm .",
    "stochastic nonlinear dynamical models of the type ( [ eq:2vdp_1 ] ) , ( [ eq:2vdp_2 ] ) can be expressed as a multi - dimensional nonlinear langevin equation @xmath15 where @xmath16 is an additive stationary white , gaussian vector noise process characterized by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a diffusion matrix .",

    "an _ a priori _ expert knowledge about the model parameters is summarized in so - called _ prior _ pdf @xmath24 . in our case we chose _",
    "prior _ in the form of zero - mean gaussian distribution for model parameters and uniform distributions for the coefficients of diffusion matrix .    if experimental time - series data @xmath25 are available they can be used to improve the estimation of the model parameters",
    ". the improved knowledge of the models parameters is summarized in the _ posterior _ conditional pdf @xmath26 , which is related to _",
    "prior _ via bayes theorem : @xmath27 here @xmath28 , usually termed the _ likelihood _ , is the conditional pdf that relates measurements @xmath25 to the dynamical model .",
    "the determinant on the right hand side of the equation ( [ eq : bayes ] ) is merely a normalization factor . in practice , ( [ eq : bayes ] ) can be applied iteratively using a sequence of data blocks @xmath29 , etc .",
    "the posterior computed from block @xmath25 serves as the prior for the next block @xmath30 , etc . for a sufficiently large number of observations , @xmath31 is sharply peaked at a certain most probable model @xmath32 .",
    "the main efforts in the research on stochastic nonlinear dynamical inference are focused on constructing the likelihood function , which compensates noise induced errors , and on introducing efficient algorithms of optimization of the likelihood function and integration of the normalization factor ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    in our earlier work  @xcite a novel technique of nonlinear dynamical inference of stochastic systems was introduced that solves both problems .",
    "to avoid extensive numerical methods of optimization of the likelihood function and integration of the normalization factor we suggested to parameterize the vector field of ( [ eq : dynamics ] ) in the form @xmath33 where @xmath34 is an @xmath35 matrix of suitably chosen basis functions @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is an @xmath38-dimensional coefficient vector .",
    "an important feature of ( [ eq : model ] ) is that , while possibly highly nonlinear in @xmath39 , @xmath40 is strictly linear in @xmath37 .",
