    "observational cosmology is just starting to benefit from unprecedented sensitivity gains at wavelengths longward of 1 @xmath3 m .",
    "a prime example is the breakthrough achieved by the cobe satellite in the first detections of the cosmic infrared background ( cib ) radiation at wavelengths from 2 to 300 @xmath3 m .",
    "these measurements provide crucial information about the integrated luminosity of galaxies . especially at the longer wavelengths , where the k - corrections of individual galaxies actually reverse sign",
    ", the cib measurements constrain the evolution of the galactic luminosity function ( lf ) back to cosmologically interesting redshifts ( @xmath40.5 ) .    to elucidate these constraints , we started with the simple empirically based model which we used previously to calculate the cib ( malkan and stecker 1998 , ms98 hereafter ) .",
    "in ms98 , we made use of infrared observations of galaxies over a wide range of luminosities and at various wavelengths .",
    "we assumed that the systematic dependence of galaxy spectra with luminosity which we observe today also applies at earlier cosmic times .",
    "we then started with the present - day infrared luminosity function of galaxies , and assumed a pure luminosity evolution for each galaxy , with @xmath5 out to a redshift of @xmath6 of 1 or 2 , beyond which no further evolution occurred .    in this paper",
    ", we use the framework of our empirically based model ( ms98 ) to derive luminosity functions at various infrared wavelengths and to make infrared galaxy count predictions .",
    "these calculations should provide timely predictions which will aid in the planning and interpretation of ongoing and new deep infrared imaging observations and their implications in understanding galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "we also re - examine our cib calculations and compare them with the recent data .",
    "several new telescopes have , or soon will obtain deep extragalactic number counts of infrared and millimeter sources in large regions of the sky at high galactic latitude which are relatively free of galactic foreground infrared emission .",
    "surveys have recently been completed with the _ isocam _ infrared space observatory camera ) and _ isophot _ ( infrared space observatory photometer ) imagers on the infrared space observatory , _ iso _ and with _ scuba _ ( submillimeter common user bolometer array ) on the james clerk maxwell telescope .",
    "several new ones are planned , _",
    "e.g. _ , with _ sirtf _",
    "( space infrared telescope facility ) , _ sofia _ ( stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy ) , _ iris _ ( infrared imaging surveyor ) , and _ first _ ( far infrared and submillimeter telescope ) .",
    "even though spectroscopic redshifts are difficult to obtain for more than a handful of the faint infrared sources , there is a high likelihood that a significant fraction of them is at cosmologically interesting distances .",
    "thus , deep galaxy number counts of sufficiently large areas will provide statistical information about galaxies at large lookback times , and therefore about galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "we use our model here to predict such number counts .",
    "we also re - examine our predictions of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the cib , in light of the subsequent _ cobe _ results .    if redshifts can also be measured ( spectroscopically or photometrically ) for statistically significant subsamples of faint infrared sources , even more",
    "details of the evolution can be determined .",
    "therefore , in this paper we also make predictions of the redshift distributions of galaxies at selected flux levels which will be accessible in the future .",
    "finally , we use the model predictions to estimate the flux levels at which various surveys should become confusion limited .",
    "the two key factors determining the infrared counts are the evolution of star formation rates , and the amount and distribution of dust grains in galaxies as a function of luminosity and time .",
    "growing observational evidence indicates that the dust contents of high - redshift galaxies was not very different from what is observed in present day galaxies ( see malkan 1998 ; 2000 for reviews ) .",
    "the more luminous low - redshift galaxies contain enough dust around their actively star - forming complexes to absorb much of the ultraviolet continuum light , and re - emit it in the mid infrared and far infrared .",
    "the ratio of infrared luminosity to blue and ultraviolet luminosity can exceed one , and this ratio is observed to be a _ systematically increasing function of galaxy luminosity _ , or current star formation rate ( spinoglio _ et al . _ 1995 ) .",
    "furthermore , the enhanced dust emission in luminous galaxies arises from relatively warm grains which emit at 25 to 60 @xmath3 m .",
    "we have made the simplifying assumption that the same systematic correlations of dust content and resulting spectral shape as a function of luminosity that we measure at @xmath7 also apply to galaxies at larger redshifts .",
    "ms98 used the correlations of bolometric luminosity with the luminosities at 12 , 25 , 60 and 100 @xmath3 m from spinoglio _ et al .  _",

    ", ms98 assumed greybody thermal emission appropriate for dust grains with emissivity @xmath14 , following the correlation in appendix b of spingolio _ et al .  _",
    "in this paper we have improved the description of the emission longward of 100@xmath15 m , the last _ iras _ ( infrared astronomy satellite ) band .",
    "we have used the growing sets of 60 to 200 @xmath3 m galaxy photometry data becoming available from the _ isophot _ instrument on _ iso_. as summarized by spinoglio _",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) , new far - infrared photometry is now available for dozens of nearby galaxies which span a wide range in luminosity .",
    "these observations confirm the prediction of spinoglio _ et al .  _",
    "( 1995 ) that the galaxies with  warmer \" ( i.e. bluer or flatter ) 60 to 100@xmath15 m spectral slopes also appear warmer in the 100 to 200 @xmath3 m region , where their thermal dust spectra approach a rayleigh - jeans distribution modified by dust emissivity @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "we also confirm their finding that the warmer dust ( associated with regions of recent star formation ) increases the 60 @xmath3 m flux relative to the flux longward of 100 @xmath3 m systetmatically in the more infrared - luminous galaxies .",
    "thus we are able to use these _ isophot _ observations to make a direct calibration of the average long - wavelength spectrum of galaxies as a function of their 60 @xmath3 m luminosity .",
    "we describe the 100 to 200@xmath3 m spectra as a broken power law with a break at 145 @xmath3 m .",
    "the slopes above and below 145@xmath3 m have the same luminosity dependence @xmath18 and @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the luminosity of a typical normal galaxy at 60@xmath3 m , @xmath21 erg s@xmath22 .    at a given luminosity ,",
    "the overall shapes of our average infrared spectra ( from ms98 ) agree well with those used in other published calculations ( pearson _ et al .  _ 2000 ; xu _ et al .  _ 2000",
    "; takeuchi _ et al .",
    "there is a tendency for our models to predict more flux around 5 @xmath3 m in luminous starburst galaxies .",
    "we believe that our seds in this wavelength range are more realistic because they are empirically based on interpolations using 3.5 and 12 @xmath3 m photometric databases of a large number of galaxies .",
    "therefore , they take account of the very hot dust which is quite often found to produce an  excess \" 3.5 @xmath3 m flux , over and above that obtained by merely extrapolating stellar photospheric fluxes longward of 2 .",

    "ms98 made calculations with 60 @xmath3 m lfs from saunders _ et al . _",

    "in figure 1 we show the galaxy luminosity functions at a redshift of 0 based on our model .",
    "the 12@xmath3 m lf has essentially the identical shape to the _ bolometric _ lf of non - seyfert galaxies , because the 12@xmath3 m flux is a constant 6% of the bolometric flux for all galaxy types except normal ellipticals ( spinoglio _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) . by comparison ,",
    "the 25 @xmath3 m and 60@xmath3 m lfs are flatter .",
    "they extend out more strongly to high luminosities because high - l galaxies emit a relatively larger fraction of their bolometric luminosities at 25 to 60@xmath3 m .",
    "conversely , the 3 @xmath3 m and 400@xmath3 m lfs are much steeper .",
    "this is because it is the less luminous galaxies which emit relatively more power at 3 @xmath3 m and 400@xmath3 m .    for comparison",
    ", we also plot estimated local luminosity functions at 12 , 25 , 60 and 100@xmath3 m , taken from the literature .",
    "the 25 @xmath3 m and 100@xmath3 m data ( @xmath27 s and open squares , respectively ) are from shupe _ et al .  _",
    "( 1998 ) and soifer and neugebauer ( 1991 ) .",
    "the particular fiducial lf we have used was specifically fitted to the 60@xmath3 m data points ( shown as solid squares ) .",
    "thus it is not surprising that the model lf ( solid line ) matches these observations extremely well .",
    "the validity of our wavelength transformation equations is confirmed by comparison of our model lf s with data at longer and shorter wavelengths .",
    "our model lf at 12@xmath3 m ( dot - dash line ) agrees well with the data from rush , malkan & spinoglio ( 1993 , solid circles , which include agn in the totals ) .",
    "new determinations of the 12@xmath3 m and 15@xmath3 m lf s ( open triangles from xu _",
    "_ 1998 ) , and at 25 @xmath3 m find substantially fewer low luminosity galaxies .",
    "one reason for this is understood : in contrast to the other lf estimates , these two new determinations were corrected for the overdensity of nearby low luminosity galaxies in the virgo cluster .",
    "these two corrected lfs thus may be be more representative of the present day universe .",
    "however , if we are using lf s to predict number counts of bright sources in the northern sky , the actual local lf of rush _ et al . _",
    "( 1993 ) would give more accurate results .",
    "on the other hand , our 100 @xmath3 m model lf has a slightly flatter slope than the data , but with essentially identical overall normalizations .",
    "our use of the lawrence _",
    "( 1986 ) lf is an adequate compromise fit to all of the local _ iras _ data from 12 to 100@xmath3 m .",
    "fortunately , none of these subtleties makes a significant difference in the predicted counts .",
    "this is because the characteristic bent shape of the lf guarantees that the counts at any flux level are always dominated by the number of galaxies around the characteristic position of the knee in the lf , defined to be @xmath20 .",
    "as long as all the lf s are accurate around @xmath20 ( where there is virtually no disagreement ) , they will yield almost exactly the correct source number counts .",
    "we confirmed this by recalculating the predicted cib for the saunders _ et al .",
    "_ lf . holding all other parameters constant , it is about 10% lower at essentially all infrared wavelengths than the cib prediction based on the lawrence _",
    "since ms98 demonstrated that active galaxies ( agn ) contribute less than 10% of the diffuse extragalactic infrared background , a fraction within the errors of the models and the data , we neglect the agn component to the cib in this work .",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 2000 ) also reached the same conclusion .",
    "the luminosity functions at higher redshifts were calculated using the pure luminosity evolution relations    @xmath28 = \\phi_{ms , z=0 } [ l_{\\nu /(1+z)}/(l+z)^q,(1+z)\\lambda ]   \\eqno{(3)}\\ ] ] where @xmath29^{-\\beta}]_{60 } d\\log\\phi_{60}/d\\log\\phi(\\lambda)\\eqno{(4)}\\ ] ] where the subscript 60 refers to a wavelength of 60 @xmath3 m and @xmath30 is the galaxy luminosity evolution parameter , respectively .",
    "we note that these are differential luminosity functions and that we follow the common convention where they are measured per unit logarithmic interval of luminosity .",

    "more complex evolutionary histories could be imagined . however , our simple two - parameter formulation captures most of the range of significant possibilities , and the observational data are far too limited to try to constrain the values of a third possible parameter .",

    "ms98 also showed a more conservative calculation , in which the luminosity evolution ( with @xmath30 still equal to 3.1 ) was frozen at @xmath36 1 .",
    "thus by @xmath37 , this conservative scenario assumes galaxy luminosities were only @xmath38 times more luminous than today , rather than the factor of @xmath39 assumed in the baseline model . in this paper",

    "we also consider here an alternate  fast evolution \" scenario , in which the evolution index is increased to @xmath40 , while @xmath6 is taken to be 1.3 .",

    "however , with fast evolution , the galaxy luminosities at @xmath42 were also @xmath4130 times higher , in contrast to the baseline model in which they were 8.6 times their current luminosities .",
    "support for the fast evolution scenario is found in the recent _ nicmos _ ( near infrared camera and multi - object spectrograph ) studies of hopkins _ et al .  _",
    "first we compare the predictions of our model with the new measurements of the cib as shown in figure 2 .",
    "the baseline model with @xmath0 , @xmath43 = 4 and @xmath6 = 2 , is shown by the middle solid line .",
    "the lower dashed curve is the prediction of our lower limit model with @xmath6 = 1 .",
    "the upper ( dot - dashed ) curve shows our fast evolution ( @xmath40 ; @xmath6 = 1.3 ) case .",
    "the predicted cib is most sensitive to the exponent of the luminosity evolution , @xmath44 . increasing or decreasing @xmath30 by 0.5 results in a cib which increases or decreases by 25 to 30% at most wavelengths .",
    "the second most important parameter is the redshift at which the luminosity evolution stops , which was @xmath45 in the baseline calculation .",
    "if @xmath6 is dropped to 1 with q unchanged , the cib drops by about 25% at most wavelengths , as is evident from the lower dashed curve .",
    "if we extend the evolution in our models to values of @xmath6 significantly above 2 , they would predict too much flux in the fir - sub mm range to be consistent with the firas results ( fixsen _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) .    finally , the least important free parameter is the maximum redshift for which infrared emitting galaxies are included , @xmath46 in the baseline case .",
    "when this @xmath43 is decreased to 2 , the cib decreases by about 30% at most wavelengths .",
    "the combination of redshift evolution and cosmology insures that it is the galaxies at redshifts @xmath411 which contribute most to the cib , as discussed further below .    in our lower limit case ,",
    "the redshift of maximum evolution is reduced to @xmath47 while @xmath30 is taken to be to 3.1 , resulting in a cib prediction about 70% lower than our baseline case .",
    "our fast evolution case gives cib fluxes which are about 30% higher than our baseline case at mid infrared and far infrared wavelengths .",
    "all of our models are consistent with the subsequent _ cobe _ detections of the cosmic background at 2.2 @xmath3 m and 3.5 @xmath3 m ( dwek and arendt 1998 ; gorjian , wright & chary 2000 ) .",
    "we note that the best constraint on the cib at mid - infrared wavelengths comes from studies of the lack of absorption features in blazar spectra up to 10 tev .",

    "( 1998 ) analysis of the _ cobe - dirbe _ data at 140 and 240 @xmath3 m .",
    "when one considers that these results were themselves at the 4 @xmath51 level and that there still may have been some undersubtraction of foreground emission , we consider our fast evolution case to be consistent with both the _ cobe - dirbe _ and _ firas _ numbers .",
    "we also show points at 140 and 240 @xmath3 m derived from the _ cobe - dirbe _ data using the _ firas _ calibration , which suffered from smaller systematic errors than the _ cobe - dirbe _ calibration ( fixsen _ et al .",
    "this calibration lowers the flux numbers and brings them into better agreement with our fast - evolution and baseline model calculations .    the point at 100 @xmath3 m was identified by lagache _",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 2000 ) as the extragalactic background flux .",
    "however , it may actually be an upper limit , since their analysis did not demonstrate isotropy ( hauser & dwek 2001).m by finkbeiner , davis & schlegel ( 2000 ) .",

    "the redshift distribution can be understood by considering the brightness of a typical bright galaxy , viewed out to various redshifts .",

    "the observed flux of a galaxy whose present luminosity is @xmath52 , given as a function of redshift , is shown in figure 3 for observing wavelengths of 25 , 60 and 200@xmath3 m . observing an @xmath52 galaxy at a fixed wavelength samples emission at progressively shorter rest - system wavelengths at progressively higher redshifts . for a wavelength of 200@xmath3 m",
    ", the peak of the far infrared spectrum of this galaxy is shifted into the observing bandpass at @xmath53 , resulting in a negative k - correction .",

    "the range of plausible models calculated above all predict cib spectra and galaxy number counts at wavelengths from 3 to 400 @xmath3 m which differ by at most a factor of 2.5 .",
    "these models also differ in their predictions of the redshift distributions of faint galaxies .",
    "we now show how even limited redshift information for flux - limited galaxy samples will discriminate between these models .",
    "several planned deep imaging surveys of low - foreground regions of the sky should be sensitive enough to detect a significant fraction of the galaxy population at moderate and very high redshifts . in early 2003 ,",

    "we assume that it will detect galaxies down to 32 mjy .",

    "( 4 ) evaluated at a fixed observing wavelength down to a given flux limit gives the differential redshift distribution , @xmath66 .",
    "we plot this distribution in figures 7a and 7b for sample deep observations at 6 , 25 , 120 and 200 @xmath3 m as a function of @xmath67 .",
    "the flux limits chosen at each wavelength are expected to be reached by planned high galactic latitude imaging surveys with new space observatories in the next several years , as discussed above .",
    "the vertical axis is absolutely normalized to one steradian of sky coverage . in table 1",
    ", we list the actual numbers of galaxies per steradian expected with redshifts above 1 and 2 in various flux - limited surveys .",
    "the next two columns give the total number and number with @xmath68 for the fast evolution scenario .",
    "the counts at a given observed flux level are dominated by the redshift at which @xmath52 galaxies appear . as shown in figure 3 , the 120@xmath3 m _ iris _ and 25@xmath3 m",
    "_ sirtf_. first look surveys can both detect @xmath52 galaxies up to @xmath69 .",
    "that is why the differential redshift distributions for all galaxies detected in these two surveys are predicted to be similar , as can be seen in figure 7 . for the baseline evolution scenario , we predict that 18% of the galaxies detected by _ iris _ will have @xmath701 , and 2% will have @xmath702 . for the fast evolution scenario , 24% of the detected galaxies will have @xmath711 and",
    "1% will have @xmath71 2 . _",
    "sofia _ is expected to have comparable long - wavelength sensitivity to _ iris _ using 1 hour integrations with chopping ( becklin 1997 ) .",
    "assuming that the _ mips _  first look \" survey will cover five square degrees , our baseline model predicts integrated counts at 25 and 70@xmath3 m of 3900 and 6100 galaxies , respectively .",
    "down to those flux limits , the cosmological depths are comparable , with median redshifts of 0.48 and 0.40 , respectively , and upper quintile redshifts of 1.17 and 0.9 .",
    "the baseline model predicts 25% and 5% of galaxies at 25@xmath3 m will have @xmath71 1 and @xmath71 2 , respectively .",
    "the fast evolution model predicts these fractions are 33% and 3% .",
    "reaching a factor of 3 deeper at 25@xmath3 m increases the depth to a median redshift of 0.8 and an upper quintile redshift of 1.64 .    in a five square degree first look survey at @xmath72 m with _ irac",
    "_ , there should be a total of 9700 galaxies detected down to 30 @xmath3jy .",
    "of these galaxies , 59% should have redshifts greater than 1 , and 20 to 28% should have redshifts greater than 2 .",
    "however , the reach would not be greatly extended by much longer time integrations . even at a limiting flux three times fainter ( 10 @xmath3jy ) , the median redshift only increases from 1.30 to 1.44 and the upper quintile redshift increases from @xmath73 to 2.46 . this is because the first look survey with _",
    "irac _ already reaches back to @xmath6 .",
    "longer time integrations tend to detect more galaxies of lower luminosity with a similar redshift distribution .",
    "the sensitivity of _ first _ is also sufficient to detect the progenitors of modern @xmath52 galaxies at all redshifts out to 5 ( see figure 3 ) . at wavelengths longward of 100@xmath3 m ,",
    "the sensitivity to high - redshift galaxies is comparable to that expected for _ irac _ at 6 @xmath3 m , owing to the positive k - corrections .",
    "we have approximated the imaging sensitivity of the spectral and photometric imaging receiver _ spire _ on _ first _ as 3.2 mjy at 250 @xmath3 m ( griffin 1997 ) , which might also be approached for small areas of sky by _ sofia_. at this flux level , the strong positive k - correction results in a remarkably far reach for detection of distant galaxies : a median redshift of 1.62 and an upper quintile redshift of @xmath74 . a _",
    "survey to 5 mjy at 150@xmath3 m ( poglitsch 1997 ) will have a median redshift of 0.93 and an upper quintile of @xmath75 , with 47% of galaxies having @xmath71 1 and 12% of galaxies having @xmath71",
    "2 . it is gratifying to see that all of these planned surveys should detect high surface densities of galaxies at these redshifts .    the predicted confusion noise limits for the beamsizes of each of these instruments are also included in table 1 .",
    "these are very optimistically set to the flux levels at which there is an average of one source per beam . in reality , confusion becomes a problem when there is one source per 10 to 20 beams , so that the real confusion limits should probably be several times larger than the numbers quoted in the table .",
    "the predictions are for the baseline evolution ; the confusion limit fluxes are slightly larger in the fast evolution scenario .",
    "all of the planned surveys will be comfortably above the confusion limit except _ spire _",
    "250@xmath3 m imaging , which is close to the confusion - limit , and _ iris _ 120 and 150@xmath3 m and _ mips _",
    "160@xmath3 m imaging , which will be dominated by confusion noise .",
    "we have used our empirically based model ( ms98 ) to predict infrared luminosity functions and deep infrared galaxy counts at various wavelengths .",
    "we have also examined our predictions for the cib for comparison with the subsequent determinations from the _ cobe - dirbe _ data analysis . using the formalism of luminosity evolution proportional to @xmath31 out to a redshift of @xmath6 and constant ( no further evolution ) for @xmath76",
    ", we find that a comparison of their predictions with current _ iso _ galaxy counts at 15 and 175@xmath3 m favor our  baseline model \" with @xmath0 and @xmath45 ( the middle curve in figure 2 ) .",
    "the @xmath77-ray limits ( sd97 ) also favor @xmath78 , as does a comparison of our predicted cib with the analysis of the _ hegra _ observations of high - energy @xmath77-ray spectrum of mrk 501 by konopelko , kirk , stecker & mastichidas ( 1999 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the _ cobe - dirbe _ far infrared determinations seem to favor a stronger evolution with @xmath2 up to @xmath63 .",
    "for example , the upper curve in figure 2 assumes @xmath40 and @xmath50 .",
    "this _ prima facie _ conflict can be resolved in two ways : either ( a ) the _ isophot _ galaxy counts may be missing a significant fraction of sources . in this case",
    ", one may also have to require that the @xmath77-ray results are wrong in that the energies of photons detected by _",
    "hegra _ have been overestimated , mimicing the effect which would be caused by absorption from a lower cib - ray absorption from pair - production ( konopelko _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) . ] , or ( b ) the",
    "_ cobe - dirbe _ far - infrared estimates may suffer from undersubtraction of foreground emission and therefore are too high .",
    "if the far - infrared galaxy counts are incomplete ( possibility ( a ) ) , this would imply stronger evolution in the far - infrared emission of galaxies than in the mid - infrared .",
    "although the ms98 model already includes some differential evolution of this type , based on the data of spinoglio _ et al . _",
    "( 1995 ) , it is conceivable that starburst galaxies at redshifts @xmath79 might produce an even higher ratio of @xmath80 m to @xmath81 m rest - frame fluxes than their present - day counterparts .",
    "radiation at these widely separated wavelengths is known to be emitted by quite different dust grains which could have a different evolutionary development , particularly for ulirgs ( ultraluminous infrared galaxies ) and agn ( active galactic nuclei ) .",
    "one should note that this possibility can make the @xmath77-ray and infrared data compatible , since absorption of @xmath41 15 tev @xmath77-rays is caused by interactions with mid - infrared ( @xmath41 20@xmath3 m ) photons and not 140@xmath3 m far - infrared photons .",
    "possibility ( b ) finds support in the independent analysis of the _ cobe _ data by lagache _",
    "( 1999 ) who obtain a flux at 140 @xmath3 m which is only 60% of the flux obtained by hauser _",
    "( 1998 ) shown in figure 1 .",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) also obtained a smaller flux at 240 @xmath3 m . in this regard",
    ", one should also note that the detections claimed by hauser _",
    "( 1998 ) were at the 4@xmath51 level . also , it is important to note that both our baseline model and our fast evolution model are within 2 @xmath51 of the _ cobe - dirbe _ results obtained by adopting the _ firas _ calibrations of fixsen , _ et al .  _",
    "( 1997 ) . in this case , _ there would be no inconsistency _ with a @xmath0 evolution being acceptable to explain the source counts , the cib and the @xmath77-ray mid - infrared upper limits .",
    "we have shown here that planned infrared imaging surveys will soon be able to measure galaxy evolution out to redshifts of 2 or greater and help to resolve the question discussed above .",
