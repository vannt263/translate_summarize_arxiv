    "moment polytope_. symplectic toric manifolds come with a natural family of lagrangian tori , namely for each @xmath16 the fiber @xmath17 is a lagrangian torus and an orbit of the @xmath10-action . in this paper",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the study of the displaceability of the lagrangian toric fibers in symplectic toric manifolds , and will assume unless explicit mention is made to contrary that the moment map is proper .    determining which lagrangian fibers are nondisplaceable involves two complementary tasks : building and computing invariants that obstruct displaceability , and finding general sufficient criteria for when lagrangian fibers are displaceable .",
    "there are now many well - developed floer - theoretic tools that can be used to prove that certain lagrangian fibers are nondisplaceable : quasi - states from hamiltonian floer homology @xcite , lagrangian floer homology @xcite , and quasi - map floer homology @xcite .",
    "in contrast the only known general method for proving that a lagrangian fiber is displaceable was introduced by mcduff in @xcite and involves the affine geometric notion of a probe in the moment polytope .",
    "schlenk @xcite also used this method of displacement in a slightly different context .",
    "the method of probes was later reinterpreted in @xcite in terms of symplectic reduction .",
    "however the main contribution of that paper was to the other side of the problem in that it allowed one to deduce many nondisplaceability results from a few basic examples .",
    "for very simple examples the method of probes perfectly complements the proven nondisplaceability results .",
    "for instance if @xmath18 is closed and monotone with @xmath19 , then the method of probes displaces everything except an identified fiber @xmath20 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.1 ) , and @xmath20 is known to be nondisplaceable .",
    "however , in general the method of probes does not perfectly complement the proven nondisplaceability results .",
    "the simplest such example is a hirzebruch surface @xmath21 for @xmath22 , which is the projectivization @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a line bundle of chern class @xmath25 . here",
    "these methods leave a line segment of points with unknown displaceability properties .",
    "the next basic example is ( a blow up of ) the weighted projective space @xmath0 , the quotient of @xmath26 by the group action @xmath27 it was pointed out in @xcite that it is possible to resolve the singularities of @xmath0 by small blow ups in such a way that there is an open set of points not displaceable by probes . on the other hand for smooth toric @xmath28-manifolds ,",
    "the nondisplaceable fibers detected by the floer theoretic methods of @xcite lie on a finite number of line segments ( cf .",
    "the proof of proposition  [ p : noghost ] ) .",
    "one expects that all fibers with vanishing invariants are displaceable .",
    "our current methods do give better results than standard probes in many cases , but still are not powerful enough to prove this even in four dimensions .",
    "as we show in proposition  [ p : noghost ] , the method of quasi - map floer homology , developed by woodward @xcite , gives no more information than standard floer theoretic methods in the closed smooth case .",
    "however , it applies also in the orbifold and noncompact cases and in those cases can give open sets of fibers that are nondisplaceable because they have nonvanishing quasi - map invariants ( called qw invariants , for short ) .",

    "the displaceable points are displaced by standard probes .",
    "below , extended probes do not help in triangles . ]",
    "as we explain in  [ ss : pot ] the open set of nondisplaceable points comes from varying the position of certain ghost \" facets ; cf .",
    "also the proof of theorem  [ t : dnd](i ) .",
    "these facets are precisely the ones that can be used to resolve the singular points , and once one has used them for this purpose , so that their position is fixed , the numbers of points with nonvanishing invariants decreases .",
    "thus as one resolves singularities by blowing up , the set of points with nonvanishing qw invariants tends to decrease .      in this paper",
    "we will introduce a technique for extending a given probe by deflecting it by an auxiliary probe .",
    "in contrast to the nondisplaceability results explained above , this technique gives no new information for very simple orbifolds such as @xmath0 .",
    "instead it starts to displace more fibers as we resolve the singularities by blow up . because it is a geometric method , it is very sensitive to the exact choice of blow up , i.e.  to the choice of support constant that determines where the new facet is in relation to the others . in higher dimensions one could use this technique in more elaborate ways , for example by deflecting a probe several times in different directions .",
