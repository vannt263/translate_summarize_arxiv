    "the study of the intrinsic properties of the @xmath12 meson as well as its production processes in elementary particle and hadron physics is of particular interest for various reasons .",
    "the properties of @xmath12 are largely governed by the dynamics of the qcd @xmath13 axial vector anomaly @xcite .",
    "expressed in the ( pseudoscalar ) quark - flavor basis , the physically observed @xmath14 and @xmath12 mesons may be written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 describe the strange and nonstrange quark - antiquark states , respectively .",
    "the @xmath13 anomaly mediates @xmath18@xmath19 transitions and therefore plays a central role in understanding the @xmath14@xmath12 mixing @xcite .",
    "the mixing angle @xmath20 is shown to be fairly constant @xcite , and a weighted average value of @xmath21 has been extracted @xcite .",
    "quite recently , the kloe collaboration @xcite has reported a value of @xmath22 . as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ etaetapmixqs ] ) , such a value of the mixing angle results in a considerable amount of @xmath23 in both the @xmath14 and @xmath12 mesons .",
    "by contrast , the corresponding mixing angle for the vector mesons @xmath24 and @xmath25 is quite small ( @xmath26 @xcite ) , providing an @xmath24 with nearly no @xmath27 and a @xmath25 being almost a pure @xmath23 state .",
    "therefore , instead of using the vector mesons @xmath24 and @xmath25 , production processes involving @xmath12 and @xmath14 offer an alternative way of probing the strangeness content of the nucleon . due to the fact that both @xmath14 and @xmath12 contain a significant amount of @xmath23 , but of opposite phase with respect to the nonstrange @xmath28 component , significant interference effects involving the strange - quark piece of the nucleon wave function are possible @xcite .",
    "in fact , it has been proposed that the relative cross sections for the reactions induced by pseudoscalar mesons , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , provide a sensitive test for the presence of the @xmath23 component in the nucleon wave function @xcite .",
    "due to its nontrivial properties , the qcd vacuum exhibits strong gluonic fluctuations with pseudoscalar quantum numbers to which the @xmath31 states can couple via the @xmath13 axial anomaly .",
    "the nonperturbative gluon dynamics and the axial anomaly @xcite are thought to be responsible for the generation of the much larger mass of @xmath12 as compared to the masses of other members of the @xmath32 pseudoscalar meson nonet known as the goldstone bosons .",
    "the masses of the goldstone bosons are generated by the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "the @xmath12 meson is , therefore , thought to couple strongly to gluons via the @xmath13 axial anomaly coupling @xcite .",
    "the unexpectedly large branching ratio measured recently for the inclusive decay of beauty particles , @xmath33 @xcite , has been interpreted as possible experimental evidence in this respect @xcite . to date",
    ", the kloe collaboration has recently found that the gluonium content in the @xmath12 is consistent with a fraction below @xmath34 @xcite . in any case , if there is a strong coupling of @xmath12 meson to gluons , it would be conceivable that short - range reaction processes such as @xmath35 might reveal the gluonic degrees of freedom in the low energy interactions involving nucleons and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "one of the properties of the @xmath36 meson of extreme importance is its yet poorly known coupling strength to the nucleon .",
    "this has attracted much attention in connection with the so - called `` nucleon - spin crisis '' in polarized deep inelastic lepton scattering @xcite . in the zero - momentum limit ,",
    "the @xmath37 coupling constant @xmath38 is related to the flavor singlet axial charge @xmath39 through the flavor singlet goldberger - treiman relation @xcite ( see also refs.@xcite ) @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a renormalization - group invariant decay constant ; @xmath42 and @xmath43 denote the number of flavors and the pion decay constant , respectively .",
    "@xmath44 describes the coupling of the nucleon to the gluons arising from contributions violating the okubo - zweig - iizuka rule @xcite .",
    "the emc collaboration @xcite has measured an unexpectedly small value of @xmath45@xmath46 . the first term on the right - hand side of the above equation corresponds to the quark contribution to the `` spin '' of the proton , and the second term to the gluon contribution @xcite .",
    "therefore , if @xmath47 is known , eq .",
    "( [ spinfrac ] ) may be used to extract the coupling @xmath48 .",
    "however , unfortunately , there is no direct experimental measurement of @xmath47 so far .",
    "reaction processes where the @xmath12 meson is produced directly off a nucleon , such as @xmath49 and @xmath50 , may thus offer a unique opportunity to extract this coupling constant .",
    "of course , other production mechanisms , such as meson exchange and nucleon resonance currents , must be taken into account before a quantitative determination of @xmath51 is possible .",
    "yet another interesting aspect in studying @xmath12 production processes is that they may provide an alternative tool to extract information on nucleon resonances , @xmath52 .",
    "current knowledge of most of the nucleon resonances is mainly due to the study of @xmath53 scattering and/or pion photoproduction off the nucleon .",
    "reaction processes such as @xmath12 photoproduction provide opportunities to study those resonances that couple only weakly to pions , especially , in the less explored higher @xmath52 mass region of `` missing resonances '' @xcite .",
    "missing resonances are those predicted by quark models but not found in more traditional pion - production reactions @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we concentrate on the reactions @xmath49 and @xmath35 .",

    "@xcite , in their theoretical investigation using an effective lagrangian approach , have emphasized the role of the @xmath54 resonance in the description of the , then , existing data @xcite , while li  @xcite has described those data within a constituent quark model with the off - shell @xmath55 excitation as the dominant contribution .",

    "@xcite described their data  obtained with much higher statistics than the previous measurements @xcite  in the energy region from threshold to 2.6gev under the assumption of resonance dominance .",
    "they considered an @xmath3 and a @xmath4 resonance with extracted masses of 1897 and 1986mev , respectively .",
    "the former resonance was needed to explain the energy dependence of the total cross section which exhibits a steep rise and falloff close to threshold .",
    "the @xmath56 resonance was needed to account for the measured forward rising angular distributions . in a calculation similar to that in ref .",
    "@xcite , zhao  @xcite introduced also a @xmath57 and an @xmath58 resonance to describe the saphir data @xcite . in both these quark model calculations ,",

    "based on a @xmath59 baryon chiral perturbation theory , borasoy  @xcite introduced the off - shell @xmath60 and @xmath55 resonances , in addition to the born and vector meson exchange contributions , to describe the data @xcite .",

    "the @xmath67 reaction has been a subject of increasing attention in the last few years .",
    "experimental data on total cross section exist for excess energies up to @xmath68  mev  @xcite , in addition to the total cross section and the angular distribution at @xmath69mev from the disto collaboration @xcite .",

    "moreover , the @xmath55 resonance was introduced in order to describe the steep rise and fall of the total cross section close to threshold .",

    "we were not able to reproduce their results using only the mesonic and @xmath55 resonance currents .",
    "the chief difference between the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : e_mr2 ] and those in ref .",
    "@xcite is that we have used an exponential form factor normalized to unity at the on - mass - shell point @xmath205 , consistent with the kinematics at which the coupling constant @xmath206 is extracted . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the form factor is normalized at @xmath207 instead .",
    "figures  [ fig : e_mr2](b ) and [ fig : e_mr2](c ) show the corresponding results for @xmath208 using the exponential form factor .",
    "they are essentially the same as those using the dipole form factor .",
    "the above considerations show that we arrive at the same conclusion , namely , that the interference between the meson exchange and resonance currents is the mechanism responsible for the angular distribution exhibited by the photoproduction data , irrespective of whether one uses the @xmath62 and @xmath24 meson exchanges in the @xmath5-channel ( with either dipole or exponential form factor ) or regge trajectories .",
    "certainly , the problem of the regge trajectory versus form factor is an extremely important issue that needs to be addressed .",
    "judging from our findings so far , it may well be that both simulate the same physics not accounted for explicitly in these calculations .",
    "we have described consistently the @xmath209 and @xmath210 reactions within an approach based on a relativistic meson - exchange model of hadronic interactions .",
    "the model includes the nucleonic and the mesonic , as well as the nucleon - resonance currents .",
    "the photoproduction process is made gauge - invariant by adding a phenomenological contact current that parametrizes the effect of the final - state interactions .",
    "the @xmath210 is described within the distorted - wave born approximation in which both the initial and final state @xmath79 interactions are taken into account explicitly .    for @xmath12 photoproduction",
    ", we have shown that the mesonic as well as the @xmath3 and @xmath4 resonance currents are important to describe the existing data .",
    "our analysis , where the widths of the resonances were set to @xmath211mev , yields a position close to 1650 mev and 1870 mev for the @xmath3 and @xmath4 resonances , respectively .",
    "this suggests that the former resonance may well be identified with the known @xmath8 resonance @xcite , whose quoted width is @xmath212mev .",
    "the @xmath4 resonance , in contrast , does not correspond to any known resonance .",
    "it is tempting to identify it with one of the missing resonances predicted at 1880 mev with the correspond width of @xmath213mev @xcite .",
    "we emphasize , however , that one should be cautious with such an identification of the resonances .",
    "as we have seen , the cross section data alone do not impose enough constraints for an unambiguous determination of the resonances .",
    "to do so probably requires more exclusive data than just the cross sections .",
    "moreover , the extracted values of the resonance masses are quite sensitive to the model used in the description of the photoproduction process .",
    "in particular , the issue of regge trajectories versus conventional vector meson exchanges ( with form factors ) is of extreme importance .",
    "these points require further investigation before a conclusive identification of the resonances can be made .",
    "our study also shows that the nucleonic current should be relatively small .",
    "indeed , the available photoproduction data prefer this current to be compatible with zero . in any case",
    ", the @xmath9 coupling constant can not be much larger than @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath12 photoproduction reaction may impose a more stringent constraint on @xmath51 , provided one measures the cross sections at higher energies and backward angles . in this respect ,",
    "as we have also shown , spin observables such as the photon asymmetry might be suited better than the cross sections .",
    "it should be noted that the result pertaining here to the @xmath9 coupling constant is , of course , a model dependent one .",
    "indeed , what is relevant in our calculations is the product of @xmath51 and the associated form factor .",
    "we have also addressed the contradictory conclusions as to the underlying reaction mechanisms arrived in the recent work by two independent groups @xcite . in our consistent calculations , whether introducing a form factor at the electromagnetic vertex in the @xmath5-channel meson - exchange current or using the regge trajectories instead , one arrives at the same conclusion ; namely , the observed angular distribution is due to the interference between the @xmath5-channel and the nucleon resonance @xmath6- and @xmath7-channel contributions , irrespective of the particular approach one uses .",
    "it is conceivable , therefore , that the phenomenological aspects of the various approaches ( including the present one ) may be simulating the same physics not taken into account explicitly .    as for the @xmath11 reaction",
    ", the present study yields the @xmath3 resonance as the dominant contribution to the production current .",
    "the @xmath4 resonance , mesonic and nucleonic currents are much smaller than the @xmath3 resonance current . the combined analysis of this and the photoproduction reaction was crucial for these findings .",
    "the details of the excitation mechanism of the @xmath3 resonance , however , are not constrained by the currently existing data . to learn more about the relevant excitation mechanism , observables other than the cross sections , such as the invariant mass distribution , are necessary @xcite , in addition to measuring the @xmath214 and/or @xmath215 process .",
    "this process will help disentangle the isoscalar and isovector meson - exchange contributions .",
    "the present model can not describe the flat angular distribution in @xmath216 measured by the disto collaboration @xcite at @xmath217mev , once the recently measured angular distribution by the cosy-11 collaboration @xcite at @xmath218mev is included in a global fitting for the relevant hadronic coupling parameters .",
    "the calculated result exhibits a pronounced angular dependence . if we wish , however , a flatter angular distribution at @xmath217mev  compatible with the disto data within the given experimental uncertainties  can be achieved provided the @xmath218mev angular distribution data is excluded from fitting .",
    "doing so , the predicted angular distribution at @xmath218mev comes out to be nearly completely isotropic .",
    "although this seems still compatible with the cosy-11 data , the latter exhibits some angular dependence which is too disturbing to be ignored .",
    "independent measurements of the angular distribution for excess energies @xmath219mev will help resolve this issue .",
