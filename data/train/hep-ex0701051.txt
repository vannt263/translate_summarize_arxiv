    "the measurement of the inclusive jet cross section as a function of the jet transverse momentum , @xmath5 , in @xmath6 collisions at @xmath7 constitutes a test of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd )  @xcite . in run",
    "ii of the tevatron , measurements of the jet cross section for jets with @xmath5 up to about 700  gev/@xmath8 @xcite have extended the @xmath5 range by more than 150  gev/@xmath8 compared to run  i  @xcite . in particular , the cdf collaboration recently published results  @xcite on inclusive jet production using the @xmath2 algorithm  @xcite for jets with @xmath9  gev/@xmath8 and rapidity  @xcite in the region @xmath10 , which are well described by next - to - leading order ( nlo ) pqcd predictions  @xcite .",
    "as discussed in  @xcite , the @xmath2 algorithm has been widely used for precise qcd measurements at both @xmath11 and @xmath12 colliders , and makes possible a well defined comparison to the theoretical predictions  @xcite .",
    "the pqcd calculations involve matrix elements , describing the hard interaction between partons , convoluted with parton density functions ( pdfs )  @xcite in the proton and antiproton that require input from experiment .",
    "the pqcd predictions are affected by the still - limited knowledge of the gluon pdf , which translates into a large uncertainty on the theoretical cross sections at high @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "inclusive jet cross section measurements from run i at the tevatron  @xcite , performed in different jet rapidity regions , have been used to partially constrain the gluon distribution in the proton .",
    "this article continues the studies on jet production using the @xmath2 algorithm at the tevatron  @xcite and presents new measurements of the inclusive jet production cross section as a function of @xmath5 in five different jet rapidity regions up to @xmath13 , based on @xmath14 of cdf run ii data .",
    "the measurements are corrected to the hadron level  @xcite and compared to nlo pqcd predictions .",
    "the cdf ii detector ( see fig .  [ fig : cdf ] ) is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the sub - detectors most relevant for this analysis are discussed briefly here .",
    "the detector has a charged particle tracking system immersed in a 1.4  t magnetic field .",
    "a silicon microstrip detector  @xcite provides tracking over the radial range 1.35 to 28 cm and covers the pseudorapidity range @xmath15 .",
    "a 3.1-m - long open - cell drift chamber  @xcite covers the radial range from 44 to 132 cm and provides tracking coverage for @xmath16 .",
    "segmented sampling calorimeters , arranged in a projective tower geometry , surround the tracking system and measure the energy of interacting particles for @xmath17 .",
    "the central barrel calorimeter  @xcite covers the region @xmath16 .",
    "it consists of two sections , an electromagnetic calorimeter ( cem ) and a hadronic calorimeter ( cha ) , divided into 480 towers of size @xmath18 in @xmath19 and @xmath20 in @xmath21 .",
    "the end - wall hadronic calorimeter ( wha )  @xcite is behind the central barrel calorimeter in the region @xmath22 , providing forward coverage out to @xmath23 . in run ii , new forward scintillator - plate calorimeters  @xcite replaced the run i gas calorimeter system .",
    "the new plug electromagnetic calorimeter ( pem ) covers the region @xmath24 , while the new hadronic calorimeter ( pha ) provides coverage in the @xmath25 region .",
    "the calorimeter has gaps at @xmath26 ( between the two halves of the central barrel calorimeter ) and at @xmath27 ( in the region between the wha and the plug calorimeters ) .",
    "the measured energy resolutions for electrons in the electromagnetic calorimeters  @xcite are @xmath28 ( cem ) and @xmath29 ( pem ) , where the energies are expressed in gev .",
    "the single - pion energy resolutions in the hadronic calorimeters , as determined in test - beam data  @xcite , are @xmath30 ( cha ) , @xmath31 ( wha ) and @xmath32 ( pha ) .",
    "cherenkov counters covering the @xmath33 region @xcite measure the average number of inelastic @xmath0 collisions per bunch crossing and thereby determine the beam luminosity .",
    "the @xmath2 algorithm  @xcite is used to reconstruct jets from the energy depositions in the calorimeter towers in both data and monte carlo simulated events ( see section  vi ) . for each calorimeter tower ,",
    "the four - momenta  @xcite of its electromagnetic and hadronic sections are summed to define a physics tower .",
    "first , all physics towers with transverse momentum above 0.1  gev/@xmath8 are considered as protojets .",
    "the quantities @xmath34 are computed for each protojet and pair of protojets , respectively , where @xmath35 denotes the transverse momentum of the @xmath36 protojet , @xmath37 is the distance ( @xmath38 space ) between each pair of protojets , and @xmath39 is a parameter that approximately controls the size of the jet by limiting , in each iteration , the clustering of protojets according to their spacial separation .",
    "all @xmath40 and @xmath41 values are then collected into a single sorted list . in this list , if the smallest quantity is of the type @xmath42 , the corresponding protojet is promoted to be a jet and removed from the list . otherwise ,",
    "if the smallest quantity is of the type @xmath43 , the protojets are combined into a single protojet by summing up their four - vector components .",
    "the procedure is iterated over protojets until the list is empty .",
    "the jet transverse momentum , rapidity , and azimuthal angle are denoted as @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , respectively .    in the monte carlo event samples ,",
    "the same jet algorithm is also applied to the final - state particles , considering all particles as protojets , to search for jets at the hadron level .",
    "the resulting hadron - level jet variables are denoted as @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "events are selected online using a three - level trigger system  @xcite with unique sets of selection criteria called paths .",
    "for the different trigger paths used in this measurement , this selection is based on the measured energy deposits in the calorimeter towers , with different thresholds on the jet @xmath50 and different prescale factors  @xcite ( see table  i ) . in the first - level trigger ,",
    "a single trigger tower  @xcite with @xmath50 above 5 gev or 10 gev , depending on the trigger path , is required . in the second - level trigger ,",
    "calorimeter clusters are formed around the selected trigger towers .",
    "the events are required to have at least one second - level trigger cluster with @xmath50 above a given threshold , which varies between 15 and 90 gev for the different trigger paths . in the third - level trigger ,",
    "jets are reconstructed using the cdf run i cone algorithm  @xcite , and the events are required to have at least one jet with @xmath50 above 20 to 100 gev .        the rest of the systematic uncertainties on the measured cross sections , including that on the total integrated luminosity",
    ", are also assumed to be independent and fully correlated across @xmath5 bins and @xmath51 regions , except those related to the @xmath52 ratio , for which uncertainties in different @xmath51 regions are uncorrelated .    a global @xmath53 test",
    "is performed according to the formula @xmath54 ^ 2}{[\\delta\\sigma^ {   d}_j]^2 + [ \\delta\\sigma^ {   th}_j(\\bar{s})]^2 }   + \\sum_{i=1}^{17 } [ s_i]^2 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the measured cross section for data point @xmath56 , @xmath57 is the corresponding prediction , and @xmath58 denotes the vector of standard deviations , @xmath59 , for the different independent sources of systematic uncertainty .",
    "the values for @xmath60 are obtained from the nominal nlo pqcd prediction , where @xmath58 includes the uncertainty on @xmath61 but does not consider pdf uncertainties . the uncertainty on @xmath61 is assumed to be fully correlated across @xmath5 bins and @xmath51 regions .",
    "the sums in eq .",
    "( a1 ) run over 76 data points and 17 independent sources of systematic uncertainty , and the @xmath53 is minimized with respect to @xmath58 .",
    "correlations among systematic uncertainties are taken into account in @xmath57 .",
    "as an example , for a given source @xmath62 , variations of @xmath59 will coherently affect all the @xmath57 values if the corresponding systematic uncertainties are considered fully correlated across @xmath5 bins and @xmath51 regions ."
