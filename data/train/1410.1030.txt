    "brownian motion , as a theory for the dynamics of a particle immersed in a resting fluid , has played a substantial role in the development of the statistical mechanics of diverse fluctuation phenomena both in and out of equilibrium situations @xcite . even though a brownian particle rests on average , it explores with time ever larger parts of space if not hindered by confining walls or other spatial constrifctions .",
    "this spreading can be quantified in terms of the particle s mean square displacement @xmath0 which , in a resting , three - dimensional fluid at thermal equilibrium , grows at large times @xmath1 proportionally to @xmath1 . in this case of so - called _ normal _ diffusion , the diffusion constant @xmath2 defined as the proportionality factor in the spreading law @xmath3 is related to the friction coefficient @xmath4 experienced by the brownian particle in the fluid and the temperature of the fluid by the einstein relation @xcite @xmath5 this relation actually goes back to sutherland @xcite .",
    "other forms of diffusion laws known as _ anomalous _ diffusion may occur in the presence of spatial constriction , or in non - equilibrium situations @xcite .",
    "often , the spreading may still be described by a power - law in time with an exponent differing from one , @xmath6 .",
    "for example , in so - called single file diffusion , the location of a hard sphere in a one - dimensional row of other equal impenetrable spheres spreads with the exponent @xmath7 @xcite . in extreme contrast to this dwindling dispersion of single file diffusion , the distance @xmath8 of a pair of particles which are advected in a turbulent fluid in three dimensions spreads according to richardson s law , @xmath9 , @xcite , with the exponent @xmath10 .    in a two - dimensional fluid at equilibrium ,",
    "mode - coupling theory predicts the diffusive motion of a brownian particle as well as the self - diffusion of fluid particles to follow a logarithmic correction to the algebraic behavior of the form @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "a selfconsistent mode - coupling theory yields a slightly weaker increase given by @xmath12 @xcite .    for the motion of a brownian particle , and also of a tagged fluid particle",
    "a formally exact description exists in terms of a generalized langevin equation , which constitutes a linear integro - differential equation for the considered particle s momentum .",
    "given the molecular interactions , the memory kernel and the fluctuating force which are the ingredients of the generalized langevin equation , can formally be derived by using the projection operator techniques of zwanzig @xcite and mori @xcite .",
    "the nature of the resulting motion of the brownian particle is determined by the behavior of the integral of the memory kernel .",
    "the motion is diffusive at large times if the time - integral of the memory kernel converges in the upper limit to a finite , non - vanishing value , called the static friction .",
    "it becomes super - diffusive , i.e. , roughly speaking , the mean square displacement grows with an exponent @xmath13 , if this integral vanishes , and the motion is sub - diffusive ( @xmath14 ) if the static friction diverges .",
    "these properties follow from the mutual dependence of the memory kernel and the momentum autocorrelation function at large times as first found by corngold @xcite .    here",
    "we demonstrate that , at large times , properly defined time - dependent friction and diffusion coefficients stay in a reciprocal relation to each other .",
    "their product is determined by a generalized asymptotic einstein relation which , for normal diffusion , agrees with its well - known form ( [ ernd ] ) .",
    "most notably , the generalized relation allows one to determine the scaling exponent @xmath15 of the particle s mean square displacement . this is the main difference between the present , generalized asymptotic einstein relation and previous forms of generalized einstein relations @xcite which are not restricted to the asymptotic large - time regime but do not explicitly contain the scaling exponent .",
    "unfortunately , the exact molecular expressions for the memory kernel and the fluctuating force are extremely involved and most often can not be analytically determined other than in limiting cases .",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the microscopic model and the parameters for the molecular dynamics simulation are specified . after a short review of the generalized langevin equation ,",

    ", we present the proof of the already mentioned generalization of the einstein relation @xcite at the end of the same section . in section iv the scaling behavior of the time - dependent diffusion and friction",
    "coefficients are determined in the framework of the molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "the scaling exponents are found to be compatible with each other in the sense that they concordantly imply the same scaling exponent @xmath15 for the mean square displacement .",
    "we also find good agreement with the value of @xmath15 following from the generalized asymptotic einstein relation .",
    "the slight difference most likely can be attributed to the presence of slowly varying functions which may modify the apparent algebraic scaling behavior . because from the available data the scaling behavior of the diffusion and friction coefficients is visible only for relatively short times it is impossible to identify and separate the contribution of such a possibly existing , slowly varying function to the apparent scaling . in the generalized asymptotic einstein relation",
    "the slowly varying contributions of the diffusion and friction coefficients compensate each other .",

    "based on mori s generalized langevin equation for the momentum of a brownian particle in combination with the assumption that its mean square displacement is of regular variation as a function of time , we derived a generalized asymptotic einstein relation .",
    "it connects the time - dependent diffusion and the friction coefficients at large times for anomalously diffusing particles in an analogous way as the einstein relation does for normal diffusion in a thermal environment .",
    "the only , but most relevant modification consists in a factor that multiplies the second moment of the momentum .",
    "this factor depends only on the scaling exponent of the considered anomalous diffusion process and becomes unity for normal diffusion . here , the time - dependent diffusion and friction coefficients are defined as the derivative of the brownian particle s mean square displacement with respect to time and the time - integral of the memory function entering the generalized langevin equation , respectively .",
    "the proof of the generalized asymptotic einstein relation is based on the fact that , under the given condition of a mean square displacement regularly varying at large times , the diffusion and friction coefficients are inversely proportional to each other , i.e. @xmath223 .",
    "here we used that any function varying regularly in time may be represented as @xmath224 with @xmath225 and @xmath161 being slowly varying . a corresponding relation between the velocity autocorrelation function and",
    "the memory kernel has been known in the case of purely algebraic scaling , i.e. with a trivial , constant slowly varying function @xcite .",
    "the use of the generalized asymptotic einstein relation allows one to estimate the scaling exponent in a way that is not influenced by slowly varying functions .",
    "we confirmed the inverse scaling behavior of the diffusion and the friction coefficients by means of molecular dynamics simulations of self - diffusion in a two dimensional liquid .",
    "the apparent deviation of the scaling exponents found from the diffusion and friction coefficients on the one hand and the generalized asymptotic einstein relation can be explained by the influence of a slowly varying function .",
    "we identified a large region in the temperature - density plane with super - diffusive self - diffusion and a cross - over region where the self - diffusion is normal .",
    "a super - diffusive behavior was found by isobe @xcite for a hard - disk fluid at moderate densities .",
    "the scaling exponents found by isobe are similar to the ones we found for a soft disk fluid .",
    "the mechanism leading to the observed algebraic behavior is not known . in particular it",
    "is not explained by the existing mode - coupling theories @xcite .    in the case of a two - dimensional lorentz gas",
    "the existence of `` empty corridors '' is responsible for the occurrence of super - diffusion @xcite . whether a similar mechanism may explain the more dynamic situation of a probe particle moving under the mutual influence of other particles presents an open question .",
    "the existence of a region with normal diffusion was reported by liu , goree and vaulina @xcite for a system of particles mutually interacting via yukawa potentials in two dimensions in a density - temperature region that is comparable with to the one where we observe normal self - diffusion .",
    "it is interesting to note that both the largest lyapunov exponent and the kolmogorov sinai entropy have their maxima as functions of the density in the same region where one finds normal diffusion @xcite .",
    "these quantities present measures of chaoticity of a system which is apparently largest for normal diffusion .",
    "the derivation of the generalized asymptotic einstein relation also holds for the motion of brownian particles which may have mass and size that differ from those of the fluid particles .",
    "in contrast to other works , as in @xcite , in which the einstein relation is extended to non - equilibrium systems that still display normal diffusive behavior , our extension refers to equilibrium systems exhibiting anomalous diffusion .",
    "the generalized asymptotic einstein relation must also be distinguished from another form of generalized einstein relation that expresses the mean position response on a small constant force in terms of the particle s mean square displacement in thermal equilibrium @xcite .    in the numerical confirmation of the generalized asymptotic einstein relation we restricted ourselves to self - diffusion ,",
    "i.e. to the motion of a test - particle with the same mass and size as all other fluid particles .",
    "the tauberian theorem relates the asymptotic behavior of a function @xmath137 for large values of @xmath1 to the asymptotic behavior of its laplace transform @xmath226 for small positive values of @xmath158 .",
