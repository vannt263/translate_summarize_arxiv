    "macroscopic landau theory of phase transitions with changes of symmetry was initially developed for crystals @xcite .",

    "the macroscopic theory of phase transitions allows to consider gravitational properties of topological defects ( appearing in the state of lower symmetry ) self - consistently , even without the knowledge of the nature of physical vacuum .",
    "the theories of braneworld and multidimensional gravity continue numerous attempts to apply the spontaneous symmetry breaking for clarifying the origin of long - standing problems in physics , such as enormous hierarchy of energy and mass scales , dark matter and dark energy effects , and others .",
    "in particular , the braneworld is considered as a topological defect , inevitably accompanying the phase transitions with spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "topological defects ( domain walls , strings , monopoles , textures , ... ) are described mathematically by the order parameter , introduced by landau @xcite .    following the pioneer works of polyakov @xcite and t hooft @xcite , the specific topological defects - monopoles -",
    "were generally described by the multiple sets of scalar fields . in braneworld theories",
    "the hedgehog - type configurations of scalar multiplets in extra dimensions played the role of the order parameters ( see @xcite and references there in ) .    though the scalar multiplet model is self - consistent , it is not the direct way for generalization of a plane monopole to the curved space - time .",
    "contrary to the flat geometry , in a curved space - time scalar multiplets and real vectors are transformed differently . in application to the braneworld with two extra dimensions",
    "the spontaneous symmetry breaking with a vector order parameter was considered in @xcite .",
    "the comparison of the two approaches showed great advantage of the vector order parameter over the scalar multiplets .",
    "the equations were of less order and more simple .",
    "their solutions had additional parametric freedom , that allowed the existence of the braneworld without any restrictions of fine - tuning type .",
    "particular derivations in @xcite were performed for the special case of two extra dimensions , diagonal metric tensor , and dependence on the only one coordinate - the distance from the brane .    in view of the evident advantages of the vector order parameter , and having in mind its numerous possible applications",
    ", it is worth deriving general covariant equations describing gravitational properties of topological defects .",
    "it is the main goal of this presentation .",
