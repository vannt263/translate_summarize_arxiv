    "dynamics of quark hadron transition is one of the most important issues in relativistic heavy - ion collisions , as well as in the universe . earlier it used to be believed that the quark - hadron transition is first order even at low chemical potential ( as in the early universe ) .",
    "this gave a very important proposal by witten @xcite about the possibility of formation of quark nuggets due to the concentration of quarks by moving phase boundaries at the quark - hadron transition .",
    "dynamics of first order transition also had important implications for heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "subsequently , lattice results showed that the quark - hadron transition is not first order , rather it is most likely a cross - over for low chemical potential .",
    "this cross - over is believed to govern the dynamics of transition in relativistic heavy - ion collisions at high energies .",
    "( though for lower energies , transition may become first order when the baryonic chemical potential is sufficiently large . )    for the dynamics of the phase transition , the most important difference between a first order transition and a cross - over ( or a continuous transition ) is the presence of a phase boundary for the former case which separates the two phases .",
    "the transition for a first order case is completed by nucleation of bubbles which expand .",
    "the moving bubble walls ( phase boundaries ) lead to physical phenomena , such as non - trivial scattering of quarks , local heating , specific types of fluctuations , etc . , which are qualitatively different from the case of cross - over or a continuous transition .",
    "it turns out that the presence of moving interfaces is more generic , and not necessarily restricted to the case of first order transitions .",
    "such situations routinely arise in the study of so called _ reaction - diffusion equations _",
    "@xcite , typically studied in the context of biological systems , e.g. population genetics , and chemical systems . typical solution of such equations , with appropriate boundary conditions , consists of a traveling front with well defined profile , quite like the profile of the interface in a first order transition case .",
    "importance of these traveling fronts in the context of high energy physics has been recognized relatively recently in several works @xcite . in the present work",
    "we demonstrate such solutions for chiral phase transition and confinement - deconfinement ( c - d ) transition in qcd even when the underlying transition is a cross - over or a continuous transition .",
    "the only difference between the field equations in relativistic field theory case and the reaction - diffusion case is the absence of second order time derivative in the latter case .",
    "thus , correspondence between the two cases is easily established in the presence of strong dissipation term leading to a dominant first order time derivative term .",
    "further , we will show that the required boundary conditions for the existence of such a _ traveling front _ naturally arise in the context of relativistic heavy - ion collision experiments ( rhice ) .",
    "for the case of the universe also it may happen in special situations as we will discuss below .",
    "we would like to clarify that the propagating front we consider here is like a phase boundary ( as in a first order transition ) , and has nothing to do with hydrodynamic flow .",
    "so , the front will still move , converting one phase ( say chirally symmetric phase ) to the other phase ( chiral symmetry broken phase ) even if the plasma is completely static . however , the qgp produced in rhice undergoes hydrodynamic expansion for which one can use either bjorken s boost invariant scaling model for longitudinal expansion , or a 3-d expansion expected to be applicable at late stages of plasma evolution .",
    "these are incorporated simply by using appropriate metric for the field equations and they lead to a term of the form @xmath0 where the time derivative is with respect to the proper time @xmath1 . it remains to be explored how this new type of phase transition dynamics can be incorporated in studies of full relativistic hydrodynamical evolution of the plasma .",
    "there is a wide veracity of reaction - diffusion equations , see , e.g. ref.@xcite .",
    "we will discuss specific equations which can be identified with the field equations for the chiral transition and the c - d transition in qcd in strong dissipation limit .",
    "subsequently we will discuss different situations in the context of rhice , with realistic dissipation , and show that propagating front solutions of these equations still persist , making the dynamics of the relevant transitions effectively like a first order phase transition .",
    "from the form of these reaction - diffusion equations it will be clear that such traveling front solutions will exist when the underlying potential allows for non - zero order parameter in the vacuum state , along with a local maximum of the potential @xcite .",
    "the corresponding values of the order parameter provide the required boundary conditions for the propagating front solution .",
    "first we consider the case of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking transition for the two flavor case with the chiral order parameter being the o(4 ) field @xmath2 .",
    "we will consider the situation in the context of rhice , and study the transition from chiral symmetry ( approximately ) restored phase to the chiral symmetry broken phase when the partonic system hadronizes during the evolution of qgp .",
    "for the plasma evolution at this stage , we will consider longitudinal expansion as well as spherical expansion ( which may be more appropriate for late stages of hadronization ) .",
    "the field equations are @xcite :    @xmath3 @xmath4    here , @xmath5 is taken along the @xmath6 direction . @xmath7 is the temperature and time derivatives are w.r.t the proper time @xmath1 .",
    "we have characterized the dissipation term here in terms of @xmath8 which is not a constant for expanding plasma . for bjorken",
    "1-d scaling case @xmath9 , while for the spherical expansion @xmath10 .",
    "we again mention that we are only using field equations in the background of expanding plasma where expansion is incorporated by using time dependent background metric .",
    "it will be interesting to study this phase transition dynamics in full relativistic hydrodynamical evolution of the plasma .",
    "the values of different parameters are taken as @xcite , @xmath11 mev , and @xmath12 mev .",
    "the coefficient of explicit symmetry breaking term @xmath13 . in the chiral limit",
    "there is a second order phase transition with the critical temperature @xmath14 . in view of the explicit symmetry",
    "breaking term we will take @xmath15 mev which allows for the presence of the central maximum in the effective potential .    to establish exact correspondence with the reaction - diffusion equation",
    ", we will first neglect explicit breaking of chiral symmetry ( i.e. @xmath16 in eq.(1 ) ) .",
    "let us also consider the extreme dissipative case of large value of @xmath8 which is time independent , and neglect the @xmath17 term .",
    "for the resulting equation , we rescale the variables as , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "the resulting equation is ,    @xmath21    this equation , in one dimension with @xmath22 , is exactly the same as the reaction - diffusion equation known as the newell - whitehead equation @xcite .",
    "the term @xmath23 is the diffusion term while the other term on the right hand side of eq.(2 ) is the so called _ reaction term _",
    "( representing reaction of members of biological species for the biological systems ) .",
    "this equation , in one dimension with @xmath22 , is exactly the same as the reaction - diffusion equation known as the newell - whitehead equation @xcite .",
    "the term @xmath23 is the diffusion term while the other term on the right hand side of eq.(2 ) is the so called _ reaction term _ ( representing reaction of members of biological species for the biological systems ) .",
    "we will briefly recall the analytical traveling front solutions for the newell - whitehead equation for the present case .",
    "subsequently we will study the solutions numerically which will help us in obtaining traveling front solutions while retaining the @xmath17 ( and with @xmath8 being time dependent as for the expanding plasma ) .",
    "non - trivial traveling front solutions for the newell - whitehead equation arise when suitable boundary conditions are imposed , namely @xmath24 and 1 at @xmath25 .",
    "the analytical solution with these boundary conditions has the form ,    @xmath26^{-1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 is the velocity of the front @xcite and has the value @xmath29 for this solution .",
    "the reaction - diffusion equations typically have several solutions , each with different propagation speeds @xcite .",
    "for example ,",
    "eq.(2 ) also has a static solution of the form @xmath30 .",
    "such a solution can have very important implications for rhice as well as for cosmology .",
    "we will later briefly comment on it .",
    "for now we continue with the above analytical solution ( eq.(3 ) ) .",
    "in fig.1a we show the propagation of this front . for this",
    "we have solved eq.(2 ) using leapfrog algorithm of second order accuracy .",
    "we have also added the second order time derivative for numerical solution of eq.(2 ) for numerical stability and also for comparison with solutions of full eq.(1 ) .",
    "the requirement of dissipation dominated dynamics is fulfilled by keeping the @xmath8 coefficient of @xmath31 term large , with constant @xmath32 .",
    "this introduces a simple scaling of velocity by a factor @xmath33 .",
    "solid curve in fig.1a shows initial profile of the analytical solution in eq.(3 ) .",
    "plots at subsequent times show the propagation of the front . the velocity of the front is numerically obtained directly by determining",
    "the velocity of the front ( specifically a particular point on the front , say @xmath34 ) .",
    "we find @xmath35 for @xmath32 in complete agreement with the scaled velocity @xmath36 .    for the case of chiral symmetry breaking transition in relativistic heavy - ion collisions , the boundary conditions required for the solution of eq.(2 )",
    "naturally arise due to radial profile of energy density of the plasma .",
    "the center of plasma represents highest temperature @xmath37 which smoothly decreases to values less than the chiral transition temperature @xmath14 in the outer regions of the plasma .",
    "thus , at any time when @xmath38 , the chiral field will take chirally ( approximately ) symmetric value ( which will be zero when @xmath16 ) at center @xmath39 and will take symmetry broken value at large distances .",
    "we will take such an initial profile , and evolve it when @xmath37 also reduces to a temperature @xmath40 below @xmath14 .",
    "for simplicity , we will assume @xmath40 to be uniform over the range of the profile of @xmath5 with @xmath5 in the center of the plasma having a value @xmath41 ( corresponding to the central maximum of the potential at @xmath42 ) .",
    "@xmath5 in outer regions of the plasma will take vacuum expectation value @xmath43 for @xmath42 .",
    "with such boundary conditions , the analytical solution in eq.(3 ) , written in terms of the original ( unscaled ) field and parameters of eq.(1 ) , takes the form ,    @xmath44^{-1},\\ ] ]    where @xmath45 is the vacuum expectation value of @xmath5 ( for @xmath16 ) and the velocity becomes @xmath46 .",
    "interestingly , the profile of this analytical solution is similar to the wood - saxon form . from the energy density profile expected for colliding heavy nuclei ,",
    "a wood - saxon type profile for the field is rather natural .",
    "it turns out that the form of the traveling front , and its evolution , is essentially unaffected even if we take non - zero value of @xmath47 in eq.(1 ) .",
    "thus , we calculate the numerical profile of the front using non - zero value of @xmath13 .",
    "this changes the boundary conditions for @xmath48 .",
    "for parameter choice in eq.(1 ) , the vacuum expectation value of @xmath5 is found to be @xmath43 = 75.18 mev while the central maximum of the potential is shifted to @xmath49 -25.93 mev .",
    "the above analytical solution in eq.(4 ) , suitably modified for these changed boundary conditions , becomes ,    @xmath50^{-1 } + \\xi\\ ] ]    where the normalization factor @xmath51^{-1}$ ] .",
    "here we use @xmath52 in order to have symmetric front on both sides of the plasma for the present 1-d case .",
    "@xmath53 represents width of central part of the plasma .",
    "we calculate numerical solutions for the full eq.(1 ) , retaining the @xmath17 term . to correspond to the analytical solution",
    ", we first consider a large , constant , value of @xmath54 in eq.(1 ) ( even though chiral transition occurs late at @xmath55 4 - 5 fm ) , and a uniform fixed @xmath15 mev .",
    "note that this does not represent realistic qgp evolution in rhice .",
    "we first study equations with constant ( and uniform ) @xmath7 _ only _ to show exact correspondence with traditional reaction - diffusion equations .",
    "we will see that the resulting propagating front is exactly the same as discussed in literature for reaction - diffusion equations .",
    "subsequently we relax this assumption of constant @xmath7 and study proper time dependence of @xmath7 for expanding qgp .",
    "we still retain the assumption of uniform temperature for studying front propagation as with spatially varying @xmath7 the effective potential also has to vary spatially and correspondence with reaction - diffusion equation becomes remote .",
    "we consider 1-d case as suitable for the newell - whitehead equation .",
    "this will be applicable when size of traveling front is large , so a planar approximation can be used .",
    "fig.1b gives the numerical profiles of the front @xmath48 at different times ( with initial time taken as 4 fm ) .",
    "the front starts at a distance of about 10 fm from the center and moves inwards converting the central region to chiral symmetry broken phase .",
    "note , as @xmath40 everywhere has a value corresponding to the symmetry broken phase , one would have expected rapid roll down of the field to @xmath56 everywhere in time of order 1 fm . in complete contrast to this",
    ", we see that phase conversion here happens slowly , by the motion of well defined interface , just like for the case of a first order phase transition . as for fig.1a",
    ", we obtain @xmath28 here also directly from the traveling front .",
    "we find @xmath28 ranging from 0.41 to 0.35 in close agreement with the expected value @xmath46 (= 0.42 ) . by finding propagating solutions for different values of @xmath8",
    "we have verified ( for both cases , fig.1a , and fig.1b ) that the velocity of the front exactly scales as @xmath33 .",
    ".,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ] .,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the propagating front solutions we obtain are very robust and almost independent of the initial profile of the front taken . to show this , we show evolution of a profile consisting of linear segments ( with correct boundary conditions ) in fig.2a . we see that this also develops into a well defined propagating front as shown in fig.1 .",
    "next , we consider realistic values of time dependent @xmath9 so that second time derivative term becomes important , with initial value of @xmath57 fm , as appropriate for the chiral transition",
    ". we also take @xmath58 in accordance with bjorken s scaling solution for the longitudinally expanding plasma .",
    "fig.2b shows the traveling front solution for this case at different values of proper time @xmath1 .",
    "the only minor difference from plots in fig.1 is seen at somewhat later stages , with a little rise at the boundary of the front . the central value of @xmath5 changes in accordance with time dependent @xmath7 .",
    "it is clear that with the presence of this _ front _ structure most of the results for first order transition , such as non - trivial quark scattering , well defined phase separated regions , fluctuations etc .",
    "will become applicable .     and time dependent @xmath7.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]   and time dependent @xmath7.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    for bjorken s 1-d longitudinally expanding plasma , one should consider transverse motion of the front .",
    "neglecting transverse expansion of the plasma , one should use eq.(1 ) with cylindrical coordinates , or spherical expansion for the late stages of plasma evolution .",
    "( 1 ) for these cases will become    @xmath59    where @xmath60 = 2 for bjorken s 1-d longitudinal expansion , and @xmath60 = 3 for spherical expansion .",
    "we have obtained front solutions for both these cases here for the chiral symmetry case as well as later for the z(3 ) case of c - d transition .",
    "the resulting solutions are very similar to those obtained for 1-d case ( as in figs.1,2 ) .",
    "hence we do not show those plots .",
    "we now consider the case of confinement - deconfinement transition during early thermalization stage . for rhice , for very early stages , bjorken scaling with longitudinally",
    "expanding plasma is a very good approximation .",
    "the dissipation term is very strong during very early stages which helps in making a direct correspondence with reaction - diffusion equations . as the traveling wave solutions exist in the symmetry broken phase we will consider the case of initial confinement - deconfinement transition using the polyakov loop order parameter with center symmetry z(3 ) spontaneously broken in the high temperature qgp phase .",
    "this early stage actually represents a non - equilibrium stage , with system thermalizing to a maximum temperature @xmath40 in a time scale @xmath61 .",
    "the thermalization time scale @xmath61 can be as short as about 0.14 fm ( at lhc ) .",
    "elliptic flow measurements indicate an upper bound of about 1 fm on @xmath61 . for the dynamics of the order parameter @xmath62 which is the expectation value of the polyakov loop , we use the following effective lagrangian density @xcite .",
    "@xmath63    where the effective potential @xmath64 for the polyakov loop , in case of pure gauge theory is given as    @xmath65    at low temperature where @xmath66 = 0 , the potential has only one minimum .",
    "as temperature becomes higher than @xmath14 the polyakov loop develops a non vanishing vacuum expectation value @xmath67 , and the @xmath68 term above leads to @xmath69 generate vacua .",
    "now in the deconfined phase , for a small range of temperature above @xmath14 , the @xmath70 0 extremum becomes the local minimum ( false vacuum ) and a potential barrier exist between the local minimum and global minimum ( true vacuum ) of the potential .",
    "as we are interested in showing the existence of traveling front solutions in the absence of any first order transition , we will consider value of temperature @xmath7 to be sufficiently large so that there is no such barrier present .",
    "for the parameter values we use , this requires @xmath71 mev , and we take @xmath72 mev .",
    "the values of various coefficients in eq.(8 ) are the same as used in our previous works @xcite ( including discussions about explicit symmetry breaking strength @xmath73 ) and we do not repeat that discussion here .",
    "( with those values of parameters , the transition temperature is taken to be @xmath74 182 mev . )    for simplicity we neglect the effect of dynamical quarks which lead to explicit breaking of z(3 ) symmetry , and hence a linear term in @xmath75 in @xmath76 above @xcite .",
    "this can be taken care of in a similar manner as the explicit symmetry breaking term @xmath47 for the chiral symmetry case in eq.(1 ) .",
    "similarly , as our interest is not in the z(3 ) structure of the vacuum , we will take @xmath75 to be real .",
    "we again first neglect the second order time derivative ( for large dissipation case ) .",
    "the variables are scaled as , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 . with that , the field equation for ( real ) @xmath62 can be written as follows ( for the sake of uniformity , we will denote @xmath62 as @xmath79 in the following ) ,    @xmath80    the final equation in this case is again a reaction - diffusion equation known as the fitzhugh - nagumo equation which is used in population genetics @xcite .",
    "thus we again expect well defined traveling wave solutions for appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "required boundary conditions for the propagating front solution for eq.(9 ) again naturally arise in rhice , during early stages .",
    "as the system thermalizes , one expects first the center of the plasma to reach a temperature @xmath81 where @xmath14 is the c - d transition temperature .",
    "the temperature in ( somewhat ) outer regions remains below @xmath14 initially .",
    "this leads to a profile of @xmath62 where @xmath82 in the other regions while @xmath83 at the center of the plasma . subsequently",
    "even these regions , somewhat away from the center , also achieve @xmath81 . with these boundary conditions ,",
    "we solve equations for @xmath62 with a uniform temperature @xmath7 with initial value = 500 mev .",
    "eq.(9 ) above was derived in the large dissipation limit to identify it with the fitzhugh - nagumo equation which guarantees the existence of a traveling wave solution for @xmath62 . with that assurance",
    ", we will now solve the full field equations for @xmath62 ( i.e. for @xmath79 ) including the second time derivative term .",
    "the dissipation term is naturally large initially in this case due to @xmath84 factor with @xmath61 being very small .",
    "again , to show direct correspondence with reaction - diffusion equation , we will take a very large , fixed , value of @xmath85 with @xmath86 fm , and will keep temperature to have fixed value @xmath87 500 mev .",
    "plots in fig.3a show the well defined traveling wave solution at different values of @xmath1 starting from initial time taken as @xmath88 fm .",
    "the initial profile is taken to have similar form as in fig.1 , suitably modified for the boundary conditions appropriate for the present case .",
    "we next consider realistic value of time dependent @xmath9 with initial value of @xmath89 fm , and take @xmath58 as appropriate for the bjorken 1-d scaling solution .",
    "resulting evolution of @xmath48 is shown in fig.3b .",
    "though @xmath5 shows some oscillations , still it shows a reasonably well defined propagating front .",
    "it is possible that @xmath8 may not decrease as fast as @xmath84 due to presence of other sources of dissipation . in that case",
    "resulting solution will be closer to that in fig.3a .",
    "= 1/(0.01fm ) .",
    "( b ) solution for realistic @xmath90 and with time dependent @xmath7.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]   = 1/(0.01fm ) .",
    "( b ) solution for realistic @xmath90 and with time dependent @xmath7.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "we now address an important issue regarding the difference in the behavior of order parameter evolutions for the chiral symmetry case and for the polyakov loop for the c - d transition case .",
    "note that we discussed traveling wave solution for the chiral symmetry case during late stages of the evolution , even though presence of large dissipation case was harder to justify for such late stages ( @xmath84 factor being relatively smaller ) .",
    "similarly , for the early thermalization stage , we only discussed the case of c - d transition with the polyakov loop , and did not discuss the chiral symmetry case .",
    "the reason is that the traveling front solutions via the reaction - diffusion equation approach arises only when the effective potential has specific shape , for example , that corresponding to spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "thus , spontaneous breaking of z(3 ) symmetry during early thermalization leads to well defined traveling front for the polyakov loop . but",
    "during this stage , chiral symmetry is restored .",
    "there is absolutely no possibility of finding any traveling wave solution for the symmetry restored effective potential for the chiral field @xmath5 ( as one can simply check analytically as well as numerically ) .",
    "similarly , while a traveling front exists for the chiral field during chiral symmetry breaking transition during late stages of the plasma , there is no such solution for the polyakov loop order parameter at that stage as the z(3 ) symmetry actually gets restored .",
    "this raises serious concerns with the conventional idea that the two transitions , namely the chiral transition and the c - d transition , are somehow related ( or , are the same ) . in our calculations",
    "we clearly find regions separated by the traveling front of one order parameter whereas no such phase separation is expected from the other order parameter .",
    "thus , we will conclude that our results support the claims of several groups that the chiral transition and the c - d transition are indeed separate , and independent , transitions .",
    "in fact , our results provide clearly phase separated regions ( by the traveling front ) which are , e.g. chirally symmetric but in confined phase , or in chiral symmetry broken phase but in the deconfined phase .",
    "we conclude by emphasizing that the techniques of reaction - diffusion equation have been used here to show existence of well defined traveling front solutions , which are very similar to phase boundaries for a first order transition case , even though the relevant qcd transitions here are of second order , or a cross - over .",
    "this allows the very exciting possibility of using earlier results valid for a first order transition case , such as formation of strangelets , baryon concentration , fluctuations etc . for rhice .",
    "our results show that the transition proceeds by slow moving front , and may take several fm time to complete , leading to long lasting mixed phase stage .",
    "this will affect calculations of various signals of qgp for rhice , e.g. production of thermal photons and di - leptons , @xmath91 suppression , and especially elliptic flow which develops mostly during early stages .",
    "as we mentioned above , the reaction - diffusion equations have other solutions also with different propagation speeds . for example , eq.(2 ) also has a static solution of the form @xmath30 .",
    "if the initial density profile in rhice leads to such a profile of @xmath48 the transition will become stagnant .",
    "this will have important implications for rhice .",
    "it is clearly of great importance to see if these results can be applied to the case of early universe ( for example , solutions with different speeds , especially the one with zero speed ) .",
    "the required initial boundary condition of @xmath92 for @xmath25 looks difficult to justify for the universe ( due to absence of a temperature profile as for rhice ) .",
    "however , one should remember that there are always density ( and hence temperature ) fluctuations present in the universe ( most likely of inflationary origin ) .",
    "though these are very tiny ( one part in 10@xmath93 ) , but if we consider these fluctuations when the temperature of the universe is very close to the transition temperature @xmath14 then there can easily be regions of space where the symmetry is restored , while other neighboring regions will have symmetry broken phase",
    ".    this will lead to the required boundary conditions for the traveling wave fronts as discussed here .",
    "small magnitude of temperature fluctuations will imply small difference in the magnitude of @xmath94 at the two boundary points , subsequently leading to small effects ( like scattering of quarks ) . however , typical wavelength of these fluctuations will be comparable to the hubble size , naturally leading to wavefront propagation over such large scales . thus , even with small quark scattering etc .",
    "one may be able to get large concentration of baryons via witten s mechanism of nugget formation .",
    "one caveat in this scenario is that chiral symmetry ( as well as z(3 ) symmetry ) are also explicitly broken .",
    "this makes the above mentioned scenario difficult to implement for the quark - hadron transition when temperature fluctuations have very small magnitude .",
    "there may be other possibilities for quark - hadron transition which we intend to explore in a future work .",
    "however , such a mechanism will certainly apply for electroweak phase transition where there is no explicit symmetry breaking involved .",
    "there also one will get traveling front solutions arising from inflationary fluctuations irrespective of the order , or the strength of phase transition",
    ". it will be interesting to investigate how such front solutions can affect the physics of post electroweak transition physics , in particular sphaleron mediated baryogenesis etc .",
