    "one of the reasons why we expect a standard quantum mechanics , described by states on a spacelike surface , to be inadequate to describe quantum gravity is that the notion of `` spacelike '' should be ill - defined in a theory where the metric itself is behaving quantum mechanically .",
    "standard quantum mechanics makes reference to spacelike surfaces not only in its description of the state of the system `` at a moment of time '' , but also in the very alternatives for which it makes predictions . a theory which predicts spacetime probabilities , such as the probability that a particle passes through an extended region of spacetime during its trajectory ,",
    "can thus be thought of as one step on the road towards a quantum theory of gravity .",
    "spacetime alternatives in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics have been considered in the past by feynman@xcite , yamada and takagi , and hartle@xcite .",
    "the present work considers spacetime alternatives for the quantum mechanics of a free relativistic particle .",
    "this is not meant as a quantum theory of actual relativistic particles ( which are described by quantum field theory ) but rather as a toy model for quantum cosmology .",
    "the relativistic particle is a better analogy to gravity than is the nonrelativistic particle , because it exhibits a single reparametrization invariance , which can be though of as a subset of the diffeomorphism invariance exhibited by general relativity .",
    "we will use hartle s generalized quantum mechanics formalism@xcite .",
    "the three fundamental elements of this theory are the possible histories of the system ( `` fine - grained histories '' ) , allowable partitions of the histories into classes @xmath0 so that each history is contained in exactly one class ( `` coarse grainings '' ) , and a complex matrix @xmath1 corresponding to each coarse graining ( `` decoherence functional '' ) .",
    "the decoherence functional must satisfy the following properties :    * `` hermiticity '' : @xmath2 * positivity of diagonal elements : @xmath3 * normalization : @xmath4 * superposition : if @xmath5 is a coarse graining constructed by combining classes in @xmath0 to form larger classes ( `` coarser graining '' ) , i.e. , @xmath6 , the decoherence functional for @xmath5 can be constructed from the one for @xmath0 by @xmath7    when the decoherence functional is diagonal , or nearly so : @xmath8 [ `` ( medium ) decoherence '' ] , then the diagonal elements @xmath9 are the probabilities of the alternatives @xmath0 , and obey classical probability sum rules .",
    "when the alternatives do not decohere , quantum mechanical interference prevents the theory from assigning probabilities to them .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the decoherence functionals for certain simple coarse grainings . depending on the initial conditions , some of these sets of alternatives will decohere and others will not . the cases which exhibit decoherence provide predictions for spacetime alternatives , however contrived .",
    "in constructing a generalized quantum mechanics of the a free relativistic particle , we follow the procedure described in @xcite ( to which the reader is referred for more details ) .",
    "the general sum - over - histories recipe is this : for a given class of paths @xmath10 , a class operator @xmath11 is constructed via a sum of @xmath12 over those histories which start at cordinate point @xmath13 ( here a point in spacetime ) , end at another ( spacetime ) point @xmath14 and are in the class @xmath10 : @xmath15}.\\ ] ] the initial and final conditions are expressed in terms of weights ( or `` probabilities '' ) @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively , and wave functions @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "although we do not presuppose the existence of a hilbert space of wave functions , it is illustrative to think of the conditions as being described by initial and final `` density matrices ''    @xmath20    and @xmath21    respectively .",
    "the initial and final wave functions are attached using a hermitian . ] but not necessarily positive definite inner product @xmath22 : @xmath23 and finally the decoherence functional is defined as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the class operator corresponding to the class @xmath26 of all paths .",
    "this construction satisfies all the usual requirements for a decoherence functional with positivity of diagonal elements ( [ pos ] ) holding as long as the weights @xmath16 and @xmath17 are non - negative .",
    "note that the inner product @xmath22 need not be positive definite to ensure positivity of the decoherence functional . the superposition property ( [ super ] ) holds because the class operators are constructed linearly , and thus satisfy their own superposition property :    [ classsuper ] @xmath27    in our chosen realization of the free relativistic particle in @xmath28-dimensional minkowski spacetime , the canonical action is written in the form @xmath29 [ where @xmath30 and the fine - grained histories we sum over are parametrized paths @xmath31 through phase space and multiplier histories @xmath32 . the multiplier @xmath33 is a quantity which classically ( i.e. , for the path of least action ) defines the relationship between proper time and the arbitrary parameter @xmath34 : @xmath35 .",
    "note that the paths are allowed to move forward and backward in the `` time '' cordinate @xmath36 .",
    "this set of fine - grained histories is lorentz invariant , as opposed to a theory which restricts the paths to move forward in time in a given lorentz frame .",
    "note also that the action is invariant under reparametrizations of the parameter @xmath34 , if @xmath33 transforms as the derivative of an invariant quantity .",
    "since we only consider reparametrization - invariant coarse grainings as being physically meaningful , we may restrict our sum over histories to those histories which satisfy the `` gauge condition '' @xmath37 . in this gauge , we need only integrate over a single @xmath33 , which is the total proper time of the path .",
    "the theory will turn out to have a closer correspondence to field theory if we integrate only over positive values of @xmath33 .",

    "the restriction of the multiplier @xmath33 to positive values has given the advertized correspondence to field theory , as our propagator is the familiar feynman propagator .",

    "the off - diagonal elements were small , but in general they could be appreciable . whenever the alternatives did decohere , the probability for each was @xmath250 , which we would have predicted on symmetry grounds .    if we coarser grained either example so that only one branch wave function was nonvanishing , we of course found decoherence and a definite prediction ( probability 1 ) of the other alternative , viz . :    * for the initial condition @xmath154 , if the alternatives were chosen to be @xmath130 and @xmath251 , we found decoherence for any nonpathological final condition , with probabilities of 0 and 1 , respectively .",
    "this was a definite prediction that the particle did not cross @xmath76 , given an antisymmetric initial condition .",
    "* for the initial condition @xmath166 , if the alternatives were chosen to be @xmath252 and @xmath253 , we found decoherence for any nonpathological final condition , with probabilities of 0 and 1 , respectively .",
    "this was a definite prediction that the particle spent part of its trajectory in @xmath71 , given an initial condition which had no support outside of @xmath71 .",
    "this is hardly surprising , and it only holds if we attach the initial wave function on the correct hypersurface .    finally , let us observe that many of our complications were a result of the fact the region which we considered intersected with our initial and final surfaces .",
    "if we had considered a region @xmath52 bounded in time , we could have chosen our initial surface to lie to the past and our final surface to the future of it . as was discussed in section [ surfcons ] , this would make the decoherence functional necessarily independent of the choice of surface .",
    "it would also have eliminated the complications in the choice of the final condition , since the branch wave functions would have been positive energy solutions to the klein - gordon equation .",
    "the proof is straightforward : construct an intermediate surface of constant time @xmath254 to future of @xmath52 but the past of @xmath89 .",
    "( section [ surfcons ] always allows us to deform the surface @xmath89 so that such a constant - time surface will `` fit '' in . ) by a construction analogous to that of halliwell and ortiz , the propagation from @xmath92 to @xmath89 avoiding the region @xmath52 can be broken up ( at the last crossing of @xmath254 ) into propagation from @xmath92 to @xmath254 avoiding @xmath52 followed by propagation from @xmath254 to @xmath89 which does not cross back over @xmath254 .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ lastcross ] . )",
    "the class operator can thus be written @xmath255 where @xmath256 is the newton - wigner propagator : @xmath257 since @xmath256 is constructed from positive - energy solutions of the klein - gordon operator , the branch wave functions @xmath258 and @xmath259 will each be positive - energy solutions themselves .",
    "thus @xmath260 , so @xmath261 , and we really do simply calculate the inner product of the branches .    however , it was the simplicity of the region @xmath71 which allowed us to solve the pde problem analytically in the first place .",
    "solution of ( [ homog ] ) for finite regions of spacetime can not be accomplished through straightforward method - of - images or separation - of - variables methods . in the nonrelativistic case ,",
    "this problem is circumvented for example in the case of a region which extends from @xmath262 to @xmath263 by propagating from @xmath264 to @xmath262 with the free propagator , from @xmath262 to @xmath263 with the restricted propagator calculated as though the region existed for all time , and then from @xmath263 to @xmath196 with the free propagator . since",
    "our paths are not single - valued in time , we can not `` turn off '' the restricting region before and after we reach it , since we have to include in the sum paths which double back into a previous regime .",
    "using the generalized quantum mechanics formalism described by hartle for the quantum mechanics of the relativistic worldline , we have examined one particularly simple coarse graining . for a suitable choice of initial conditions , albeit a more restrictive one than for the nonrelativistic theory",
    ", we were able to assign approximate probabilities to some sets of alternatives .",

    "to calculate the elements of the decoherence functional for sec .",
    "[ antisymres ] , we first expand our notational convention for the branches to include @xmath266 and @xmath267 so that we can write @xmath268 , where @xmath269 .",
    "the nonvanishing elements of the decoherence functional are now @xmath270 where the inner product is on the surface @xmath41 .    if @xmath87 is a solution to the klein - gordon equation , we know that @xmath271",
    ". this will not be true for @xmath272 because it is _ not _ a solution .",
    "however , for the purposes of the klein - gordon inner product on the surface @xmath41 , we only need the value and normal derivative of each function on @xmath41",
    ". we can thus replace @xmath272 by @xmath273 , a klein - gordon wave function . ] which matches @xmath272 and its normal derivative on @xmath41 .",

    "defined in sec .",
    "[ images ] , we define @xmath293 .      to proceed any further , we would like an explicit form for the surface @xmath89 .",
    "the simplest would be that @xmath89 is a surface of constant time @xmath196 .",
    "however , that condition would not be lorentz invariant , as it would pick out a reference frame in which the final surface was one of constant time .",
    "we know from section [ surfcons ] that we are only restricted in the choice of @xmath89 by the form of the @xmath296-surface @xmath297 .",
    "if we restrict our attention to choices of @xmath297 which are flat ( a suitably invariant condition ) , we can always work in a reference frame in which @xmath89 _ is _ a surface of constant time .",
    "since we construct @xmath89 so that @xmath67 lies in it , this is consistent with the assumption that @xmath67 has no time component .",
    "subject to the condition of @xmath89 being flat , @xmath297 is a point , so this holds trivially . ] , then , we can work in a reference frame where it is to be a surface of constant time , so that @xmath298 the definition ( [ rhom ] ) of @xmath299 means that @xmath300 now , @xmath301 the integral over @xmath302 gives @xmath303 , and the integral over @xmath153 gives @xmath304 substituting into ( [ expchi ] ) gives @xmath305 with @xmath306 .",
