    "a classical t  tauri star ( ctts ) is a pre - main sequence ( pms ) star which presents a characteristic phenomenology which , in general , includes the following : i ) an emission line spectrum , including , in the visible , lines such as the balmer series with very intense h@xmath1 ; hei d@xmath3,d@xmath4,d@xmath5 and hei 6678  ; caii h & k and caii infrared triplet at 8498 , 8542 and 8662  ; etcetera .",
    "these emission lines ( in particular h@xmath1 ) are quite broad ( several hundred km / s at fwhm ) , and can present asymmetries .",
    "ii ) the presence of forbidden generally blue - shifted narrow lines ( for example , [ oi]6300&6364 , [ nii]6458&6581 , [ sii]6717&6731 ) .",
    "iii ) photospheric continuum excesses , specially in the ultraviolet , the blue part of the optical range and the infrared ( class ii spectral energy distribution ) . not all of them appear simultaneously .",
    "there are different proposed criteria to define ctts , and they do not always agree with each other . the simplest criterion is based on the equivalent width of h@xmath1 ( w(h@xmath1 ) ) .",
    "critical values between 5 and 20  have been put forward .",
    "martn ( 1998 ) suggested a dependence with the spectral type : 5  for spectral types earlier than m0 , 10  for m0m2 , and 20  for later spectral types .    the canonical interpretation of ctts phenomenology states that they possess a circumstellar disk , containing a significant fraction of the mass of the star , which is the source of the infrared excess , and a strong magnetosphere ( see appenzeller & mundt 1989 for a review ) .",
    "material from the disk would be magnetically accreted onto the star , in a channeled flux , creating a hot spot , the source of the continuum excesses in the blue side of the spectrum .",
    "the broad , asymmetric h@xmath1 ( or other hydrogen lines ) is produced by this material falling from the disk . in general , for permitted lines , blue - shifted absorptions denote strong winds , whereas red - shifted absorptions indicate infalls . finally , the forbidden lines are produced in outflows , which are as this interpretation goes jets perpendicular to the disk , and are driven by the accretion . for more details , see shu et al@xmath6 ( 1994 ) , hartmann et al@xmath6 ( 1994 ) and hartmann ( 1998 ) .",
    "weak - line t  tauri stars ( wtts ) lack most of the observational features of ctts .",
    "they show h@xmath1 in emission but with equivalent widths smaller than in the case of ctts ( herbig & bell 1988 ) .",
    "some wtts show infrared excess , but not ultraviolet excess or optical veiling .",
    "naked t tauri stars ( ntts ) are equivalent to the wtts but without infrared excess ( walter 1986 ) . it is assumed that wtts are in a more advanced stage of their evolution , with no circumstellar accretion disks . hence , the origin of the emission in h@xmath1 should be purely chromospheric .",
    "wtts are still very young ( @xmath710 myr ) , and their interior has not reached a temperature hot enough to destroy lithium which burns at about 2.5@xmath810@xmath9 k. finally , post - t  tauri stars ( ptts ) represent the subsequent pms evolution of the previous two phases .",
    "together with rapid rotation and high activity levels , they have already started the lithium depletion ( martn 1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "brown dwarfs ( bd ) are substellar objects which are unable to settle on the main sequence because their interior reaches a degenerate state ( hayashi & nakano 1963 ; kumar 1963 ) . for solar metallicity , current models predict that the borderline between stars and bds is at 0.072 m@xmath10 ( burrows et al@xmath6 1997 ; baraffe et al@xmath6 1998 ; chabrier et al@xmath6 2000 ) .",
    "bds are low - mass analogs to pms stars because they are fully convective , gravitationally contracting objects .",
    "there is a continuity from the stellar to the substellar regime in a color - magnitude diagram , a continuous dwarf sequence .",
    "in fact , very low mass ( vlm ) stars need tens of billion of years to reach the ms ( longer than the age of the universe ) .",
    "observationally , the substellar limit is located at spectral type of m6 in the pleiades cluster ( martn et al . 1996 ) .",
    "this spectral type boundary between stars and bds is also used in the literature for very young ages ( luhman et al@xmath6 1998 ) .    since the discovery of the first confirmed bds in the pleiades cluster ( rebolo et al@xmath6 1995 ; basri et al@xmath6 1996 ) , an avalanche of discoveries and theoretical work has taken place .",
    "the standard formation mechanism of bds is that they come from small cores produced by the fragmentation of molecular clouds star formation does not know about the h - burning substellar limit .",
    "recent theoretical work indicates that very small fragments can be produced by turbulence in molecular clouds ( padoan & nordlund 2002 ) .",
    "if bds are formed in a similar manner as stars , it seems natural to expect that some very young bds could share the same properties as ctts .",
    "in particular , they could have circum - substellar disks with active accretion leading to an emission line spectrum and continuum excesses .",
    "in fact , during the last 2 years some initial reports indicate that a few of them , indeed , have disks ( martn et al@xmath6 2001a ; natta & testi 2001 ; natta et al@xmath6 2002 ; testi et al@xmath6 2002 ; jayawardhana et al@xmath6 2002ab , 2003ab ; barrado y navascus et al@xmath6 2002 , 2003 ; white & basri 2003 ) .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to explore an empirical criterion based on low - resolution optical spectroscopy , which allows to identify accretion phenomena by distinguishing between ctts , wtts and their substellar analogs .",
    "we adopt the following definitions : substellar classical t tauri analog ( sctta ) , which is a substellar - mass object that shows emission lines indicative of active accretion similar to those observed in cttss ; substellar weak - line t tauri analog ( swtta ) , which shows chromospheric line emission similar to that of wtts .",
    "we find that scttas and swttas can be classified statistically from low - resolution optical spectroscopy using spectral types and w(h@xmath1 ) .",
    "another criterion , proposed by white & basri ( 2003 ) , is based on the width of this line , but its application demands high resolution spectroscopy which is more difficult to obtain , particularly for intrinsically faint substellar objects .",
    "our study extends the classical / weak - line t  tauri classification into the substellar regime .",
    "we have applied our criterion to derive the ratio of sctta / swtta in different star - forming regions .",
    "this ratio allows us to discuss the dependence of accretion on age , mass and location .    in section 2 , we discuss some of the properties of the ctts and wtts population of very young clusters and star forming regions .",
    "it also presents an analysis of the h@xmath1 equivalent width as a the main empirical criterion to classify ctts , wtts , sctta and swtta . in section 3",
    ", we compare the ratios of accretion in several star forming regions .",
    "section 4 summarizes the results , stating the main conclusions .",
    "both classical and weak - line t  tauri stars have been identified using near infrared color - color diagrams .",
    "we have collected h@xmath1 equivalent widths of t  tauri stars belonging to different star forming regions and very young clusters and compared them with the color excesses .",
    "these color excesses were computed using the measured color indices and spectral type , and the typical color indices corresponding to the spectral type , as listed by bessell & brett ( 1988 ) , kirkpatrick et al@xmath6 ( 2000 ) , and leggett ( 1992 ) and leggett et al@xmath6 ( 2000 , 2002 ) .",
    "figure 1 illustrates one of these comparisons for stars in taurus .",
    "open and solid circles denote the location of weak - line and classical t  tauri stars , respectively . in this and other figures discussed below displaying w(h@xmath1 )",
    ", we have avoided objects which have been classified as classical or weak - line t  tauri stars or substellar analogs based on the w(h@xmath1 ) , i.e. , the displayed ctts and sctta show either broad h@xmath1 , forbidden lines , strong infrared excesses , or veiling .",
    "all the data presented in this paper come from a large diversity of papers ( see section 2.4 for references ) , and the corresponding spectra were collected at very different resolutions .",
    "this can translate into different values of the equivalent width for a given object ( i.e. , lower resolution tends to yield larger w(h@xmath1 ) than high resolution spectroscopy ) .",
    "this is a caveat that has to be kept in mind throught this and any other similar analysis .    in figure 1",
    ", we display as short dashed lines two w(h@xmath1 ) criteria used in the literature for classifying ctts .",
    "clearly , most of the ctts are above the 20  threshold , whereas most of the wtts have w(h@xmath1)@xmath115  . however , there is an area in between where the transition from wtts to ctts is not clear - cut .",
    "part of the confusion arises from the fact that h@xmath1 emission can also be produced by chromospheric activity .",
    "therefore , our next step is to study the h@xmath1 emission of active young stars .",
    "figure 2a displays the ratio between the h@xmath1 and the bolometric luminosities versus the spectral type for members of three young open clusters , namely the pleiades , alpha per and ic2391 .",
    "the age ranges are 80125 myr , 5090 myr , and 3053 myr for each of them , depending on the age dating technique : upper main - sequence isochrone fitting or lithium depletion at the substellar limit , respectively ( maeder & mermilliod 1981 ; meynet et al@xmath6 1993 ; stauffer et al@xmath6 1998 , 1999 ; barrado y navascus et al@xmath6 1999 ) . the vertical ,",
    "dotted lines delimit the age - dependent lithium gap in each cluster ( see barrado y navascus & stauffer 2003 and references therein ) . in order to convert h@xmath1 equivalent width into luminosity",
    ", we followed a similar procedure as the one described by mohanty & basri ( 2003 ) .",
    "we computed fluxes corresponding to the continuum around 6563  @xmath12(h@xmath1) using theoretical models by allard et al@xmath6 ( 2001 ) .",
    "we selected those having log  g=4.5 , which correspond to ages between 50 and 100 myr ( baraffe et al@xmath6 1998 ) .",
    "in particular , we used `` dusty '' models for t@xmath13@xmath113900 k and `` nextgen '' models for higher effective temperatures .",
    "we note that `` nextgen '' models are good enough down to t@xmath13=2500 k ( martn et al@xmath6 2001b ) , but the predicted fluxes for both sets are very similar and they do not affect the results . then , the flux of the h@xmath1 emission line was computed as @xmath14(h@xmath1)= w(h@xmath1)@xmath8@xmath12(h@xmath1 ) .",
    "finally , the ratio can be expressed as l(h@xmath1)/l(bol ) = @xmath14(h@xmath1)/@xmath0t@xmath13 , where l(h@xmath1 ) and l(bol ) are the luminosity in the h@xmath1 line and the bolometric luminosity .",
    "this diagram clearly shows a maximum at -3.3 , which it is essentially defined by low mass stars with m2-m4 spectral types .",
    "a similar diagram was obtained by mohanty & basri ( 2003 ) for mid - m and l field objects ( see their figure 7 ) .",
    "besides h@xmath1 , this saturation limit also occurs in other activity indicators such as the x - ray luminosity ( stauffer et al@xmath6 1994 ; randich et al@xmath6 1996 ) or in h@xmath15 ( delfosse et al@xmath6 1998 ) .",
    "we have found that our saturation limit , log \\{l(h@xmath1)/l(bol)}=@xmath23.3 , derived from the young open clusters ic2391 , alpha per and the pleiades , is somewhat higher than the values obtained by delfosse et al@xmath6 ( 1998 ) and mohanty & basri ( 2003 ) in field mid - dm stars , and late m and l spectral type very low mass stars stars and bds . since the first group ( cluster members ) are , on average , younger , and they have larger radius ( the ratio between the radii of a 0.072 m@xmath10 at 100 and 500 myr is 4.7 , according to baraffe et al@xmath6 1998 models )",
    ", this difference suggests that there is an evolutionary component , perhaps related with size and/or surface gravity , in the saturation limit and , by extension , in the chromospheric activity in objects at the end of the dwarf sequence .",
    "a similar conclusion has been reached by basri & mohanty ( 2003 ) .",
    "now , we are interested on observational quantities , in particular w(h@xmath1 ) . therefore , starting with this saturation limit , we have proceeded backward and derived the w(h@xmath1 ) value for each spectral type which would correspond to it .",
    "since we are trying to define a criterion for ctts and sctta , which have maximum ages of about 10 myr , we have used the atmosphere models corresponding to a gravity of log  g=4.0 .",
    "figure 2b shows the measured w(h@xmath1 ) of members ( low mass stars and bds ) of these three young clusters .",
    "the bold  dotted line corresponds to the saturation limit at log \\{l(h@xmath1)/l(bol)}=@xmath23.3 dex .",
    "this criterion can be found in tabular form in table 1 . from now on ,",
    "this criterion will be called the _",
    "saturation criterion_.    the dashed line in figure 2b corresponds to the upper envelope of the w(h@xmath1 ) for the clusters . for objects cooler than m5.5 , the maximum w(h@xmath1 ) measured is 20  .",
    "note , however , that the data are sparse at the low mass end of these cluster sequences . for stars warmer than this spectral type ,",
    "the behavior is pseudo - linear in a logarithmic scale .",
    "we have selected a fit which includes all the measurements .",
    "this curve , which is purely empirical , will be called the young cluster _",
    "chromospheric criterion _ from now on .",
    "the mathematical expression of this criterion is :    @xmath16    where the spectral type o1 corresponds to 1 , b1 to 11 , a1 to 21 , etcetera .",
    "this fit is valid between spectral types g5 and m5.5 .",
    "there is a clear tendency that the cooler the object , the larger the h@xmath1 equivalent width , on average .",
    "the general reason for this trend is the decreasing photospheric luminosity at the wavelength of h - alpha as the temperature decreases ( the so - called `` contrast effect '' ; basri & marcy 1995 ) .",
    "the quantitative behavior of the line strength , however , is not well understood .",
    "we adopt this upper envelope as the maximum emission due to chromospheric activity , without taking into account values measured during flares ( known flares , such as that of ppl-15 detected by basri & martn ( 1999 ) , have been excluded ) .",
    "figure 3 is as figure 2 , but in this case a comparison with flare stars is displayed ( uv cet type , crosses ) .",
    "the figure also includes cooler objects recently discovered by the 2mass survey ( skrutskie et al@xmath6 1997 ) , down to the l5 spectral type ( plus symbols ) . note the logarithmic scale in the y - axis .",
    "the selected uv cet sample comes from gershberg et al@xmath6 ( 1999 ) .",
    "the iau defines uv cet variables as : `` dwarf stars of spectral classes dm3e - dm6e characterized by rare and very short flares with amplitudes from 1 mag to 6 mag .",
    "maximum brightness ( usually sharp ) is attained in a few , or several tens of seconds after the commencement of the flare , total duration of the flare being equal to about ten to fifty minutes '' . a more general definition , which comes from gershberg et al@xmath6 ( 1999 ) , is : `` uv cet - type variables are stars on the lower part of the main sequence which show phenomena inherent to the solar activity .",
    "the most manifestations of the solar activity are detected on such stars : sporadic flares , dark spots , variable emissions from chromospheres and coronae , radio , x - ray and uv bursts . ''",
    "therefore , this definition includes the first one ( all the stars in the first group should be in the second ) .",
    "the sample shown in figure 3 is based on this definition .    regarding the cooler sample ,",
    "the data come from kirkpatrick et al@xmath6 ( 2000 ) , gizis et al@xmath6 ( 2000 ) ; reid et al@xmath6 ( 2002 ) ; and mohanty & basri ( 2003 ) .",
    "in addition , stars and bds with variable h@xmath1 , mainly due to the presence of flares , are also included as arrows and labeled .",
    "the beginning and the end of each arrow represent the minimum and maximum h@xmath1 equivalent width ever recorded .",
    "the data come from ruiz et al@xmath6 ( 1990 ) ; irwin et al@xmath6 ( 1991 ) ; eason et al@xmath6 ( 1992 ) ; basri & marcy ( 1995 ) , kirkpatrick et al@xmath6 ( 1995 ) ; martn et al@xmath6 ( 1996 , 1999 , 2001 ) , delfosse et al@xmath6 ( 1997 ) ; tinney et al@xmath6 ( 1998 ) , tinney ( 1999 ) ; gizis et al@xmath6 ( 1999 , 2000 ) ; liebert et al@xmath6 ( 1999 , 2003 ) ; reid et al@xmath6 ( 1999 , 2002 ) ; hall ( 2002ab ) ; zapatero osorio et al@xmath6 ( 2002b ) ; and mohanty et al@xmath6 ( 2003 ) .",
    "this figure includes two different curves .",
    "the first one ( bold , dotted line ) , also in figure 2 , is the saturation criterion .",
    "the second curve , plotted as a thin - solid line , is the upper envelope of the flare stars and field very low mass stars and brown dwarfs , which defines the _",
    "flare criterion_.    as the visual inspection and the comparison with figure 2 show , most of the flare stars do have h@xmath1 equivalent width which is less or equal than the upper limit defined by cluster stars . in any case , in order to establish the nature of an object with a strong h@xmath1 emission , several consecutive spectra should be collected , to check the possibility of a flare .",
    "this an advisable strategy regardless the final goal , when acquiring spectra ( i.e. , splitting the total exposure time into three or four consecutive observations ) .",
    "we have done the same exercise for several star forming regions and very young clusters , with ages in the range 1 - 10 myr , and displayed h@xmath1 equivalent with against the spectral type .",
    "these results are depicted in figure 4 , which includes the orion population ( from herbig & bell 1988 ; alcal et al@xmath6 1996 , 1998 , 2000 ) , taurus ( briceo et al@xmath6 1993 , 1998 , 1999 , 2002 ; alencar & basri 2001 ; martn et al@xmath6 2001a ; luhman et al@xmath6 2003a ; white & basri 2003 ; muzerolle et al@xmath6 2003 ) ic348 ( herbig 1998 ; luhman et al@xmath6 1999 , 2003b ; muzerolle et al@xmath6 2003 ; jayawardhana et al@xmath6 2003a ) , sco - cen - lupus - crux complex , including the @xmath17 oph molecular cloud ( bouvier & appenzeller 1992 ; martn et al@xmath6 1998 , 2004 , in prep ; ardila et al@xmath6 2000 ; jayawardhana et al@xmath6 2002a ; mamajek et al@xmath6 2002 ) , chamaeleon  i ( guenther et al@xmath6 1997 ; comern et al@xmath6 2000 ; saffe et al@xmath6 2003 ; jayawardhana et al@xmath6 2003 ) , @xmath0 orionis cluster ( bjar et al@xmath6 1999 ; barrado y navascus et al@xmath6 2001 , 2002 , 2003 : zapatero osorio et al@xmath6 2002a ) , and tw  hydra association twa ( sterzik et al@xmath6 1999 ; webb et al@xmath6 1999 ; zuckerman et al@xmath6 2001 ; gizis 2002 ; mohanty et al@xmath6 2003 ) .    in these figures , solid circles , small open circles and open triangles correspond to ctts / sctta , wtts / swtta and ptts , respectively .",
    "these classifications are based on criteria that do not use the w(h@xmath1 ) .",
    "small crosses denote unclassified objects .",
    "note the logarithmic scale in the y - axis .",
    "stars and bds with mid - infrared excesses ( signpost of circumstellar disks ) are indicated as large open circles .",

    "the vertical dotted segment is located at the spectral type which divides the stellar from the substellar domain ( for ages younger than @xmath18100 myr ) .",
    "the bold , dotted curve corresponds to the saturation criterion to classify cttss and substellar analogs .",
    "traditional criteria dividing between classical and weak - line t  tauri stars , such as the 5 or 20  limits ( long - dashed horizontal lines ) , are also included .",
    "note that these criteria do not describe the ctts / wtts phenomenology appropriately .",
    "the criterion proposed by martn ( 1998 ) . which depends on the spectral type , is more reliable .",
    "our saturation criterion improves upon the previous ones and extends into the substellar domain .      when weighting together all the data and criteria presented in the sections above , we have noted that most ctts have h@xmath1 equivalent widths larger than the characteristic values of older stars ( i.e. , cluster and field stars ) even when these last ones are flaring .",
    "our main goal is to define an empirical spectroscopic criterion to classify any object as accreting or non - accreting using solely low - resolution optical spectroscopy .",
    "the data clearly indicate that all stars and brown dwarfs , except the few exceptions mostly having large variability , that are located above the saturation criteria ( the h@xmath1 equivalent width corresponding to log \\{l(h@xmath1)/l(bol)}=@xmath23.3 ) are , indeed , accreting and , therefore , they can be classified as bona - fide ctts and sctta .",
    "this is a rather restricting criterion : all objects above this line should be ctts and sctta ( except for very strong peaks of flare activity which are short lived and rare ) . below this dividing line",
    "there could be objects with a low - level of accretion .",
    "furthermore , we note that throughout this paper , we have used the measured equivalent widths , without any correction due to the veiling of the continuum .",
    "therefore , true equivalent widths should be equal or larger for ctts and scttas than the measured values , and all or some of the accreting objects located below the saturation criterion might be , in fact , above it once the veiling correction is performed .",
    "unfortunately , the data in the literature are incomplete and very inhomogeneous regarding the technique to derive the veiling , and we have opted for using the uncorrected values .    in order to make easier the visual inspection , and to compare our criterion with all the available data , we have included in figure 5 the information displayed in figures 4a-4h .",
    "figure 5 also shows ( solid line ) the re - definition of the criterion proposed by martn ( 1998 ) , carried out by white & basri ( 2003 ) .",
    "our proposed criterion has a sound physical basis : the maximum amount of energy which can be released in non - thermal processes by the chromosphere , @xmath185@xmath810@xmath19 of the total energy .",
    "objects exceeding this limit must have drawn it from other sources , such as accretion from a disk .",
    "this criterion is listed in table 1 , which contains the h@xmath1 equivalent width depending on the spectral type .    as a conclusion ,",
    "a moderate signal - to - noise ( s / n@xmath1835 ) , low resolution ( r@xmath18600 ) spectrum is enough to detect most of the ctts and sctta .",
    "there are exceptions , such as a post - t  tauri star belonging to the sco - cen complex , with w(h@xmath1 ) larger than the saturation criterion .",
    "however , additional information , such as the lithium abundance measured in the stellar photosphere , is enough to disentangle this ambiguity ( see martn et al@xmath6 1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "finally , some of the substellar objects with disks ( detected via their infrared excesses or because of the presence of forbidden lines in their spectrum ) do not satisfy the proposed saturation criterion .",
    "we conclude that the amount of material they are accreting should be relatively small when compared with more massive accretors .",
    "this might suggest , too , that the time scale for disk dissipation is smaller in brown dwarfs .",
    "the veiling might be affecting by a large amount their evolution , when compared with accreting stars .",
    "therefore , besides the saturation criterion , additional information is very helpful to detect accretion in most of the substellar objects , such as w(hei5876 ) , w(hei6678 ) or the ratios between the components of the caii infrared triplet .",
    "note , however , that they have h@xmath1 above the cluster chromospheric criterion , which equals 20  in this region ( objects cooler than m5.5 ) .",
    "we have made use of our empirical criterion the saturation at log \\{l(h@xmath1)/l(bol)}=@xmath23.3 to determine the number of ctts and substellar analogs in several star forming regions , and to compute the fraction of accretors ( i.e. , the fraction of objects harboring an active circumstellar or circum - substellar disk ) .",
    "table 2 lists the name of the association or cluster , their age ( including maximum and minimum values commonly quoted in the literature ) and the fraction of accreting objects , as computed for several spectral ranges .",
    "since the saturation criterion based on the equivalent width of h@xmath1 is very restrictive , the values compiled in the table can be considered as lower limits .",
    "figure 6 displays , in a log - log plane , this information . in this figure",
    ", we depict in three different panels the fraction for stellar members ( k3-m5.5 ) and substellar components ( m5.5-l2 and m5.5-m7.5 ) .",
    "the selection of the m5.5-m7.5 range responds to the need of avoiding biases due to incompleteness of the surveys .",
    "however , we do not appreciate any significant difference .",
    "we have selected the spectral type m5.5 as the substellar borderline based on theoretical models 1 or 10 myr isochrones by baraffe et al@xmath6 ( 1998 ) .",
    "although there are significant uncertainties due to poor statistics in some cases , ages derived in heterogeneous ways ( different evolutionary tracks or methodology to convert theoretical parameters into observational quantities , see stauffer et al@xmath6 1995 ) , age spread within the association , an so on , the decline of the disk frequency seems to be linear .",
    "the data suggest that the accretion disk life - times are similar in the substellar domain than for more massive objects .",
    "we note the low fraction of accreting stars found in rho oph , although this could be related to strong veiling which could diminish the measured h@xmath1 equivalent widths and , hence , the fraction of accretors estimated from h@xmath1 .",
    "recent works ( muench et al .",
    "2001 , haisch et al .",
    "2001 , jayawardhana et al .",
    "2003b , liu et al .",
    "2003 ) have derived the fraction of objects with disks using different techniques for these and other sfr .",
    "although the ratios are systematically larger in those studies -it has been stated before that our fraction represents only a lower limit , the trend of decreasing disk emission with age is similar to what we find .",
    "thus , w(h@xmath1 ) alone is adequate tool to study the frequency of accreting objects in clusters and star - forming regions .",
    "based primarily on the saturation limit at log \\{l(h@xmath1)/l(bol)}=@xmath23.3 , we have been able to establish an empirical criterion to distinguish between ctts and wtts , and we have extended it into the substellar domain . an schematic classification is shown in figure 7 .",
    "four regions are defined in this figure .",
    "region a is populated by cttss and their substellar analogs .",
    "they have w(h@xmath1 ) above the line defined by the saturation ( i.e. , the origin can not be chromospheric ) . since the equivalent width values are very high , a moderate signal - to - noise , low resolution optical spectrum is enough to detect the presence of accretion . in region",
    "( b ) classical , weak - line t  tauri and flaring objects can be found .",
    "most of the objects in this area should be bds .",
    "in particular , all wtts and ctts with spectral type cooler than m5.5-m6 .",
    "this area is delimited by the saturation criterion ( up ) and the maximum chromospheric activity measured in upper clusters ( down ) .    since there is a mixture of objects in region b , it is useful to obtain additional information about the objects .",
    "+ b1.- several consecutive spectra at moderate s / n , low resolution , can establish whether the object is flaring , since the h@xmath1 equivalent widths change very fast and with a very characteristic pattern .",
    "+ b2.- spectroscopy at r@xmath183000 resolution ( @xmath20v=100 km / s ) allows a rough study of the h@xmath1 line profile and width . in the case of very low mass stars and brown dwarfs ,",
    "white & basri ( 2003 ) have proposed fwhm=270 km / s as a criterion to establish the presence of accretion ( i.e. , ctts / sctta ) .",
    "+ b3.- at this resolution , the lithium feature at 6708  can be detected ( s / n@xmath1835 ) .",
    "the lack of lithium denotes that the object is older than the time needed for disk dissipation ( @xmath1810 myr ) and must have a mass larger than 0.060 m@xmath10 .",
    "+ b4.- other lines and line ratios , measured in low or medium resolution spectra , such as those hei5876 , hei6677 and caii irt , can differentiate between ctts / sctta , wtts / swtta , and older objects experiencing flares .",
    "in region c there are classical , weak - line and post - t  tauri stars .",
    "the limits are the same as for region b , but in this case , this region is located at the warmer side of the diagram .",
    "additional information that helps to classify objects in this regions includes spectroscopy with resolution r@xmath183000 , which is enough to measure the width of the h@xmath1 line and use the 10% fwhm criterion , which allows the distinction between sctta and swtta .",
    "the lithium depletion or absence of it is an adequate tool for differentiating between t  tauri and post - t  tauri stars .",
    "region d is populated by cluster and field stars and bds .",
    "this area also includes weak - line and post - t  tauri objects and is delimited by the upper envelope of the activity measured in young open clusters .",
    "additional criteria to classify objects in region d include : + d1.- as in b1 , several low resolution spectra are essential to detect a flare .",
    "+ d2.- again , a r@xmath183000 spectrum suffices to detect the lithium feature in an object with a spectral type later than about m0 , and to measure the activity .",
    "lithium equivalent width can be compared with the values shown by cluster members , weak - line and post - t  tauri stars and brown dwarfs . + d3.- moderate resolution spectroscopy ( r@xmath2110,000 ) provides measurements of the rotational velocity ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "since there is a relationship between age and rotation ( slower rotators being older for a given spectral type , stauffer et al@xmath6 1987ab , 1989 ) for dwarfs earlier than about m6 , this information characterizes , from the statistical point of view , the evolutionary status .",
    "+ d4.- finally , lithium equivalent widths can be measured in objects with spectral type earlier than m0 if a spectrum with resolution larger than r=10,000 is available .      as a conclusion , by re - analyzing h@xmath1 and lithium equivalent widths in members of several young open clusters and star forming regions ,",
    "we have been able to define well - defined spectroscopic criterion based on the saturation limit for young open clusters , which can be used to statistically classify populations of stars and bds in young open clusters and star - forming regions using low - resolution optical spectroscopy , which is efficiently obtained using multi - object spectrographs .",
