    "[ introduction ] the reflection and transmission of light at air - medium interface has been a topic of ongoing investigation and contention .",
    "initially , the amplitudes and directions of reflected and transmitted light were determined by fresnel formulas and snell s law .",
    "deviations were later found in total internal reflection ( tir ) , however .",
    "they are goos - hnchen ( gh ) shift  @xcite and imbert - fedorov ( if ) shift  @xcite , which are parallel and perpendicular to the incident plane , respectively .",
    "artmann formula  @xcite for gh shift and schilling formula  @xcite for if shift in tir are widely accepted . the exact formulas for if shifts in partial reflection and transmission , however , have divided many physicists  @xcite .",
    "owing to hosten s precise measurement , the debate was settled down  @xcite .",
    "apart from the constant spatial gh and if shifts , the light beam also experiences angular shifts  @xcite , which increase proportionally with propagation distance @xmath0 . in general , the spatial gh and if shifts stem from spin - orbit interaction at the air - medium interface  @xcite .",
    "to satisfy the @xmath0-component angular momentum conservation law , the reflected and transmitted beams must possess extrinsic transverse orbital angular momenta , which results in spatial gh and if shifts .",
    "the angular shift is essentially a diffractive correction on light beams and governed by the linear momentum conservation law  @xcite .",
    "the emergence of left - handed materials ( lhm ) has brought about great opportunities and sophisticated pathways to manipulate light  @xcite . as a branch of metamaterials",
    ", lhm usually refers to those materials whose permittivity and permeability are negative simultaneously .",
    "it has shown very unique properties , like negative refraction  @xcite , inverse doppler effect  @xcite , unreversed rotational doppler effect  @xcite and inverse cherenkov radiation  @xcite .",
    "apart from these properties , beam shifts in lhm have been demonstrated to be significantly different from right - handed materials ( rhm )  @xcite .",
    "theoretical papers  @xcite indicate that light beam experiences negative gh shift at air - lhm interface and this shift can be amplified in layered structure .",
    "the if shift in partial reflection , however , remains unreversed owing to unreversed spin angular momentum in lhm  @xcite . as for vortex beam",
    ", it carries intrinsic orbital angular momentum .",
    "therefore , orbit - orbit conversion is inevitable in reflection and transmission .",
    "will the spatial gh and if shifts remain unreversed in the presence of orbital angular momentum ?",
    "how about the angular shifts ?",
    "what does the physical picture of spin - orbit and orbit - orbit conversions look like ? clarifying these problems is not only conducive to understanding the detailed behaviors of vortex beams at air - lhm interface but also sheds a new light on the essence of angular momentum and linear momentum of vortex beam .    in this paper",
    ", we endeavor to offer concrete expressions of spatial and angular shifts of vortex beam at air - lhm interface and elaborate on their relations with the linear and angular momenta .",
    "we also contrast these results with air - rhm interface .",
    "although some of the results are similar to our previous paper  @xcite , we conduct considerably rigorous analyses on the topics and thorough explanations on the results .",
    "the rest of the paper is arranged as follows . in sec .",
    "[ electric fields ] , we adopt angular spectrum method to derive the electric fields of reflected and transmitted vortex beams at air - lhm interface . except for some special cases , for instance , in the vicinity of critical angle of tir and brewster angle , the expressions of electric fields generally hold true . the longitudinal fields are included as well , which take on polarization - sensitive vortex structure  @xcite , providing a new perspective on the mechanism of if shifts other than spin - orbit conversion . in sec .",
    "[ shifts ] , we adopt the operator method to calculate the spatial and angular shifts , which is significantly different from conventional calculation method  @xcite and save us considerable time and efforts . the gh and if shifts in tir and partial transmission are demonstrated and contrasted with air - rhm interface .",
    "the impact of incident angle on beam shifts is analyzed as well . in sec .",
    "[ momenta ] , we calculate the linear and angular momenta of incident , reflected , and transmitted beams , respectively",
    ". the origins of spatial and angular shifts are clarified . the quantitative analysis on spin - orbit conversion and orbit - orbit conversion",
    "is also demonstrated .",
    "in this study , we adopt the angular spectrum method to establish a model for the reflected and transmitted vortex beams at air - lhm interface . the main procedures of this method are as follows .",
    "we first decompose the vortex beams into plane waves with finite spectral width .",
    "then , we analyze the incident angle and fresnel coefficients of each plane wave component separately . in this case , the incident angle and fresnel coefficients of each plane wave slightly differ from that of the main fourier component ( also known as central wave component ) .",
    "therefore , we expand the fresnel coefficients in taylor series around the central incident angle and make approximation to the first order .",
    "afterwards , we transform the electric fields from momentum space to position space .    the geometry of reflection and transmission is demonstrated in fig .",

    "although the abraham - minkowski dilemma has been solved  @xcite , why minkowski momentum is a proper form in this study , we believe , is an interesting problem worth further investigation .",

    "one paper  @xcite adopted the real - space approach and revealed the role of longitudinal field @xmath221 in if shifts for the first time .",
    "we think additional analysis on the connection between longitudinal field and spin - orbit conversion can also be carried out in the momentum space .",
    "the other paper  @xcite unambiguously separated the effects of beam shape and other parameters ( such as polarization , the property of the interface ) on gh and if shifts , which has long escaped researchers attention over the past years .",
    "but the discussions are confined to reflected vortex beam . generalization to transmitted vortex beam , we think , remains quite challenging .",
    "third , owing to the close similarity between light beam and matter waves , scientists have found that electron beams can also possess orbital angular momentum by passing through a spiral phase plate  @xcite or nanofabricated diffraction hologram  @xcite . in this regard",
    ", we hopefully predict that vortex electron beam might also experience vortex - induced shifts in a potential well . by properly designing the potential well and taking advantage of quantum weak measurements or other measuring technology",
    ", we may even observe the vortex - induced beam shifts of electron beam in experiment .",
    "in conclusion , we have derived the reflected and transmitted fields of vortex beam at air - lhm interface via angular spectrum method . by using this method ,",
    "we have managed to get the formulas of spatial gh shifts , spatial if shifts , angular gh shifts , and angular if shifts .",
    "these formulas suggest that the spatial gh and if shifts remain unreversed at air - lhm interface compared with air - rhm interface . by raising the vortex charge ,",
    "the spatial shifts can be remarkably enhanced . in tir , apart from reversed gh shift , we predict that the if shift would also be reversed when the incident beam is in mixed linearly polarized state .",
    "the physical interpretation of these interesting phenomena lies in the reversed transverse angular momenta and reversed linear momenta .",
    "although the spatial shifts have no direct relations with the @xmath0-component angular momentum ( @xmath0-component angular momentum is not reversed in lhm ) , they are actually the outcomes of spin - orbit and orbit - orbit conversion . therefore , the unreversed spatial shifts are indirect evidence of unreversed angular momentum of lhm . as for angular shifts ,",
    "they are reversed at air - lhm interface and can be amplified by enhancing the vortex charge .",

    "<S> in this paper , we present a systematic study of beam shifts and angular momenta of paraxial vortex beams at air - left - handed material ( lhm ) interfaces . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that , compared to their counterparts at air - right - handed material ( rhm ) interfaces , the spatial goos - hnchen ( gh ) and imbert - fedorov ( if ) shifts remains the same , while the angular gh and if shifts are reversed , at air - lhm interfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial and angular shifts of paraxial vortex beams have their respective origins in transverse angular momenta and transverse linear momenta . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial gh and if shifts remain unreversed as a result of the both reversions of transverse angular momenta and z - component linear momentum , while the angular gh and if shifts are reversed due to that the z - component linear momentum is reversed and the transverse linear momenta are unreversed , at air - lhm interfaces . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we perform a quantitative analysis on spin - orbit angular momentum conversion and orbit - orbit angular momentum conversion , which further helps us understand the essence of vortex beam shifts at air - lhm interfaces and their fundamental distinctions with those at air - rhm interfaces . </S>"
