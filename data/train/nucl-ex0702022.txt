    "light vector mesons are among the most interesting probes of the matter created in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "measurement of meson properties in @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 collisions provides a basis for observation of anomalous features specific to heavy ion collisions and allows separation of various effects affecting particle production .",
    "one of the most exciting rhic measurements was the observation of suppression of high transverse momentum hadrons in central @xmath4 collisions .",
    "later it was found that baryons ( protons ) and light mesons ( @xmath8 ) have different suppression tendencies that brought up the `` baryon puzzle ''  @xcite .",
    "measurement of nuclear modification factors for vector mesons adds to the picture of particle suppressions and their dependence on particle mass and composition supporting hydrodynamics or recombination models .",
    "short life times of @xmath0- and @xmath1-mesons ( @xmath9  @xmath10 , @xmath11  @xmath10 ) presuppose that significant part of them decays inside the hot and dense nuclear matter produced in heavy ion collisions .",
    "theoretical models  @xcite predict that basic properties of the light vector mesons such as mass , width and branching ratios can modify in presence of this media .",
    "such modifications can be studied by comparison of meson properties measured in leptonic and hadronic decay modes in different collision systems .",
    "the two central spectrometers of the phenix experiments  @xcite each covering @xmath12 in azimuth and @xmath13 in pseudorapidity have a capability to measure neutral and charged particles produced in rhic collisions .",
    "beam - beam counters in combination with zero degree calorimeters provide the trigger and are used to determine @xmath14-coordinate of the collision vertex and the event centrality .",
    "momentum of charged particles is measured with the drift chamber ( dc ) and the first layer of the pad chamber . for hadron identification phenix",
    "has a high resolution tof subsystem covering half of the east arm and electromagnetic calorimeter ( emcal ) covering both arms . the tof subsystem and time of flight of the emcal identify kaons within @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively .",
    "the electrons are identified with the ring imaging cherenkov detector and by matching of energy and momentum measured for the charged tracks in the emcal and dc respectively .",
    "emcal is also used as a primary detector for reconstruction of @xmath17 and @xmath8-mesons  @xcite .    for reconstruction of @xmath18 and @xmath19",
    "decays we combine oppositely charged identified particles to form invariant mass spectra containing both the signal and combinatorial background of uncorrelated pairs .",
    "the shape of the combinatorial background is estimated in mixed event technique where particles are taken from different events having the same centrality and collision vertex . the mixed event invariant mass distribution is normalized to @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the measured integrals of like sign yields  @xcite .",
    "raw yields are counted around known particle masses after subtraction of mixed event distributions from invariant mass spectra .    to measure hadron decays of the @xmath0-mesons we start with reconstruction of @xmath8- mesons in @xmath23 channel . for @xmath24 and @xmath25",
    "decays we combine selected @xmath8-candidates either with all other photons from the same event or with any pair of oppositely charged unidentified tracks .",
    "integrals of peaks reconstructed in invariant mass distributions are extracted by fitting since mixed event approach does not reproduce background due to residual correlations  @xcite . in @xmath4 collisions",
    "we reconstruct @xmath0-mesons only in @xmath24 channel because four particles in the final state produce too much combinatorial background in @xmath25 decay .",
    "extracted raw yields of vector mesons are corrected for reconstruction efficiencies evaluated with full simulation of the phenix layout , detector responses , kinematics of particular decays and online trigger settings . for three body decay of @xmath0-meson we also take into account a non uniform population of the phase space .",
    "left panel of figure  [ fig : spectra ] shows @xmath1-meson @xmath26 spectra in @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 collisions at @xmath5 and 200  @xmath6 .",
    "phenix has an extensive set of @xmath19 measurements in time - of - flight region for different collision systems and event centrality bins .",
    "preliminary measurement in @xmath27 channel is limited by statistics because of small signal to background ratio and is consistent with the hadronic channel within the errors .",
    "exponential fits shown in the same figure are used to extract integrated yields ( @xmath28 ) and temperatures ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the invariant @xmath30 spectra measured for @xmath0-mesons in @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 collisions at @xmath31  @xmath6 are shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : spectra ] . for",
    "two hadronic decays @xmath24 and @xmath25 having different kinematics and reconstruction efficiencies we have a very good agreement in @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in @xmath4 collisions we measured three @xmath30 points in each most central , minimum bias and peripheral collisions in @xmath24 channel . in minimum bias @xmath4 collisions phenix",

    "the integrated @xmath1-meson yield per participant increases by approximately a factor of two from peripheral to central collisions for two rhic energies .",
