    "<S> [ fig : spectrum ] , is markedly different from the known strongly polarization dependent behavior seen in the two - magnon response in antiferromagnetically ordered systems . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the characteristic features of the weakly polarization - dependent response @xmath0 can be related either to the flux , or the majorana fermion sector : first , the polarization - independent kitaev contribution @xmath1 reflects the majorana matter fermion density of states in the ground state flux sector . </S>",

    "<S> second , the heisenberg contribution , which has a weak polarization dependence with a simple overall intensity change , is related to flux excitations , e.g.  @xmath142 for @xmath143 . a striking feature is a sharp peak at the energy of the four flux gap @xmath144 originating from the zero - particle contribution ( overlap between ground states ) , see eq .  </S>",

    "<S> this is a clear signature of a pure flux excitation for the _ isotropic _ gapless qsl ( @xmath145 ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that normally sharp lines in raman scattering are attributed to optical phonons which appear at different energy scales  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , @xmath2 has a broad response in energy reflecting the two - particle density of states of matter fermions propagating in the background of four inserted fluxes .    </S>",
    "<S> our analysis of the raman response relies on the stability of the kitaev qsl with respect to addition of small heisenberg exchanges ( note that the latter is believed to be small in the proposed kitaev model realisations in iridates ) . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that for small heisenberg couplings the features that we find are robust , being only somewhat renormalized by non - local fluctuations originating from the dynamics of the fluxes generated by the heisenberg exchange ( or disorder which is present in real materials ) . </S>",
    "<S> crucially , there is a window of parameters where the features that we find should be observable , thus making raman scattering an important experimental tool for diagnosing kitaev qsls .    </S>",
    "<S> _ discussion . </S>",
    "<S> _ the calculation of the heisenberg part @xmath2 of the raman response is equivalent to a non - equilibrium problem with a sudden insertion of four fluxes . </S>",
    "<S> the raman vertex of the kitaev model does not change the flux sector , but the integrability breaking contribution due to heisenberg interactions does . </S>",
    "<S> the latter takes the form of a quantum quench which generates an unusual sharp @xmath139-function component in the response .    in general , for kitaev type models we expect that the calculation of correlation functions @xmath146 , whose operators @xmath147 change the flux sector , can be mapped to a local quantum quench for majorana fermions by exploiting selection rules and by eliminating flux degrees of freedom as pioneered for the spin correlation function in the original kitaev model  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is true , for example , for the calculation of spin correlations in generalizations of the honeycomb model to higher dimensions  @xcite ( or possibly even to different classes  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the response will mainly be determined by the low energy matter fermions ; e.g.  depending on the fermi surface topology , a singular behavior may appear . </S>",
    "<S> overall , while a qsl might be stable with respect to sufficiently weak integrability breaking interactions , the change in response functions can be remarkable , revealing basic properties of the underlying phase by connecting otherwise orthogonal sectors of the emergent gauge flux .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that raman scattering renders visible both flux and majorana fermion excitations potentially relevant to iridates . </S>",
    "<S> it thus presents a valuable tool for diagnosing topological quantum states .    </S>",
