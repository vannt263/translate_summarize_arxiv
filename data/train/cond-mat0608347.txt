    "this effect is a consequence of the aharonov bohm effect .",
    "the angular momentum of an electron in the groundstate of a quantum ring in a magnetic field can be non zero , as can be seen in the energy spectrum of fig.[fig : spectrum](a ) . this fact is closely related to the fascinating physics of the persistent currents in mesoscopic rings@xcite .",
    "the change of groundstate angular momentum about the quantization axis from @xmath2 to @xmath3 is a decisive feature distinguishing quantum rings from quantum dots .",
    "such angular momentum transitions were observed in self assembled quantum rings@xcite .",
    "effects of spin - orbit terms have been studied in mesoscopic rings@xcite .",
    "currently there is renewed interest in them in semiconductor quantum rings .",
    "this is because electron spin may be controlled by spin - orbit terms",
    ". such a control would be valuable for spintronics , quantum information , and spin qubits@xcite .",
    "recently several effects of spin orbit coupling on optical@xcite and transport@xcite properties of semiconductor quantum rings have been investigated . a spin filter@xcite and a qubit@xcite have been also proposed . in this paper",
    "we investigate the energy degeneracy of self - assembled semiconductor rings on the magnetic flux in the presence of spin orbit interactions .",
    "we show how _ large gauge _ and _ time reversal _ transformations can be used to determine the degenerate properties of the single electron energy spectrum of such a system .    before we give a summary of our main results we comment on some basic properties of large gauge transformations , spin orbit terms in semiconductors , and time reserval operation .",

    "suppose it is threaded by a magnetic flux @xmath4 ( the direction of the magnetic field is chosen to be along the z - axis ) .",
    "it has rotational invariance about the z - axis that goes through the center of the ring .",
    "in addition it is invariant under a _",
    "large _ gauge transformation , which transforms wavefunctions as follows . when the flux is increased from @xmath4 to @xmath5 the electron wavefunction changes as @xmath6 where _",
    "only _ integer values of @xmath7 are allowed@xcite .",
    "the azimuthal angle of the cylindrical coordinate system is @xmath8 .",
    "although time reversal symmetry is broken when a flux threads the ring spin invariance is present .",
    "each energy level is thus doubly spin degenerate",

    "the wavefunctions of a degenerate pair are related to each other by the symmetry operation . when only the rashba term is present analytical solutions of eigenstates are possible . in this case",

    "suppose the electron experiences an external magnetic field along the z - axis with the vector potential @xmath133 . to illustrate the effect of the zeeman term we calculate the energy spectrum for @xmath134 with the physical parameters @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "for this semiconductor the rashba term is the dominant spin orbit coupling .",
    "we assume that the radius is much larger than the ring width .",
    "for the radius of the ring @xmath137 the energy scale is @xmath138 and @xmath139=6.70 f$ ] .",
    "the zeeman term couples the degenerate states @xmath140 and @xmath141 since @xmath142 is non zero .",
    "but it does not couple @xmath143 and @xmath132 since @xmath144 is zero .",
    "this is the reason why there is only one anticrossing near , for example , @xmath126 , as can be see in fig.([fig : zeeman ] ) .",
    "the value of degenerate energy is @xmath145 in the absence of the zeeman term .",
    "note that the degeneracy between @xmath141 and @xmath143 at @xmath146 is lifted unlike the degeneracy between @xmath132 and @xmath140 at @xmath147 .",
    "we have argued that the electron hamiltonian of narrow semiconductor rings with the rashba and dresselhaus spin orbit terms is invariant under time - reversal operation followed by a large gauge transformation , provided that the zeeman effect is absent .",
    "we find that all the eigenstates are doubly degenerate when integer or half - integer quantum fluxes thread the quantum ring .",
    "the wavefunctions of a degenerate pair are related to each other by the symmetry operation .",
    "these qualitative results are valid both for ii - vi and iii - v semiconductor rings . a disorder potential and non - circular ring will not break the relevant symmetry and the presence of degeneracy .",
    "we have obtained analytical and simple expressions for the energy spectrum when the rashba term is dominant .",
    "some of degenerate energy levels anticross in the presence of the zeeman term .",
    "since the zeeman effect complicates the energy spectrum to some degree , as shown in fig.([fig : zeeman ] ) , semiconductor rings with a rather small zeeman effect , such as gaas rings , are more suitable for experimental study of the level degeneracy .",
    "however , in this case , a considerable numerical work is needed to compute a quantitatively correct energy spectrum due to the presence of the dresselhaus term .",
    "measurement of conductance oscillations@xcite or optical emission lines@xcite may reveal the level degeneracy .",
    "another suitable ring system to investigate is a superconductor and semiconductor hybrid system@xcite .",
    "each vortex of the abrikosov lattice of the superconductor has half of the quantum unit flux , and a semiconductor ring under the superconductor can trap this flux@xcite .",
    "the distance between the vortices must be larger than the diameter of the semiconductor ring , and this may be achieved by controlling the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "the advantage of such a system is that the zeeman effect is absent since only the central part of the ring is threaded with half integer flux .",
    "when an inas semiconductor is used , for example , the rashba term is dominant , and our analytical results should describe well the energy spectrum of such a ring .",
    "it is desirable to calculate numerically the energy spectrum quantitatively when both the rashba and dresselhaus terms are present in addition to the zeeman term",
    ". it may be worthwhile to investigate the effect of the finite width of the ring @xcite .",
    "the double degeneracy at an integer or half integer flux may be used to generate non - abelian berry phases , see ref.19 .",
