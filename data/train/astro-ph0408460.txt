    "the study of the emission characteristics from rotation powered pulsars has been a subject of long standing interest .",
    "our knowledge of the fundamental properties ( e.g. , mass , spin , and magnetic field ) of the underlying neutron star stems from detailed spectral and timing investigations . to facilitate an understanding of the mechanism by which the loss of rotational energy is converted into high energy radiation ,",
    "many observational and theoretical studies have sought to determine the relationship between the x - ray luminosity , @xmath0 , and the rate of rotational energy loss or spin down power , @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , a correlation of the form @xmath9 was found in einstein data by seward & wang ( 1988 ) .",
    "subsequent studies using a larger sample of pulsars led to a relation of the form , @xmath10 based on rosat data ( see becker & trmper 1997 ) and @xmath11 based on asca data ( see saito 1998 ) .",
    "recently , a reanalysis of 39 pulsars based on data obtained from several x - ray satellites by possenti et al .",
    "( 2002 ) led to an intermediate relation @xmath12 , similar to that of seward & wang ( 1988 ) .",
    "while the deduced existence of a correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 suggests that the observed x - rays are produced by a process which taps the rotational energy of the neutron star , a detailed description of the mechanism remains elusive .",
    "this is , in part , a result of the fact that the data from different satellites are obtained in different energy ranges .",
    "the results can be affected , for example , by interstellar absorption especially for those pulsars studied in the soft x - ray regime of rosat ( 0.1- 2.4 kev ) .",
    "in addition , the total x - ray luminosity is composed of contributions from both the pulsed and non - pulsed components , and these components are likely to reflect physical conditions in diverse spatial environments .",
    "the x - rays radiated by rotation powered pulsars could include contributions from 5 distinct components with different origins : + 1 . non - thermal non - pulsed diffuse radiation can be emitted from a pulsar wind nebula .",
    "the radiation will be discussed in  2 , and we suggest that this emission component is the major contribution to the non - pulsed x - ray radiation in the asca observations of pulsars .",
    "non - thermal non - pulsed radiation from the pulsar magnetosphere could be important as suggested by becker et al .",
    "( 2004 ) if the angular resolution of x - ray detector is sufficiently high to separate this contribution from that of the nebula .",
    "although such a component may be present in the asca data that we use , due to its low angular resolution , it is not likely to dominate the contribution from the pulsar wind nebula .",
    "for example , tennant et al . (",
    "2001 ) have found a non - thermal non - pulsed component from the crab pulsar by using the high - resolution camera of the chandra x - ray observatory .",
    "they estimate that the x - ray luminosity of this component is @xmath13 , whereas , the non - thermal non - pulsed x - ray luminosity from the crab nebula detected by asca ( saito et al .",
    "1997a ) is @xmath14 .",
    "the specific origin of the non - thermal non - pulsed component , not associated with the nebula , is not clear .",
    "although it contaminates the emission of the nebula , it is small .",
    "provided that this contribution is small for all the pulsars we study in this investigation , this component should not affect our analysis .",
    "the non - thermal pulsed radiation component is generally believed to be produced from the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "this follows from the fact that the motion of charged particles within the light cylinder is strongly affected by the magnetic field , and the radiation of charged particles in the open field lines should be pulsed .",
    "this component could be produced in the vicinity of the polar cap as a result of inverse compton scattering of higher order generation pairs of particles on soft photons emitted by the neutron star ( zhang & harding 2000 ) or in the outer magnetosphere as a result of synchrotron radiation of downward cascades from the outer gap electron / positron particles ( cheng & zhang 1999 ) .",
    "the thermal non - pulsed radiation from the pulsar surface can contribute to the soft x - ray bands , typically , characterized by @xmath15 kev ( cheng & zhang 1999 ) . in this paper , we have used the asca data on pulsars so this component will not contribute to the 2 - 10 kev asca energy band .",
    "the thermal pulsed radiation from the pulsar surface likely originates in a polar cap on the neutron star surface and can contribute to the hard x - ray band ( @xmath16 kev ) . in analyzing the pulsed emission from pulsars , we follow the model of cheng & zhang ( 1999 ) where the thermal pulsed x - ray emission is included in their model prediction .    thus , the x - ray emission observed from pulsars in the asca sample primarily consists of contributions from components 1 , 3 , and 5 .",
    "we have assumed that component 2 is not important and component 4 does not significantly contribute to the 2 - 10 kev energy band .",
    "on the other hand , becker & trmper(1997 ) have used rosat data and obtained a linear relation between the x - ray luminosity consisting of components 2 and 3 and spin - down power . in the present paper ,",
    "we concentrate on the x - ray properties in the energy band of asca ( 2 - 10 kev ) .",
    "the x - rays , then , consists of a thermal component from the polar cap , a non - thermal pulsed component from the magnetosphere and a non - thermal , non - pulsed emission from the nebula .",
    "that is , we have explicitly assumed that the pulsar magnetosphere and the pulsar wind nebula are primarily responsible for the pulsed and non - thermal non - pulsed component respectively .",
    "since the pulsed and non - pulsed emission have different origins , the relationship between the total x - ray luminosity and spin down power is not expected , in general , to be represented by a single power law .",
    "in fact , the non - thermal pulsed and non - pulsed emission components are distinguished by different spectral signatures and conversion efficiencies . to determine their relative importance and their relationship to the spin down power",
    ", we have reexamined the pulsar data obtained in the 2 - 10 kev energy band of the asca satellite , focusing on separating the non - pulsed and pulsed emission data . in the next section ,",
    "we provide a simplified description of the emission from a pulsar wind nebula , based upon earlier work by chevalier ( 2000 ) , where the relativistic pulsar wind interacts with the interstellar medium . in  3 , the x - ray properties of the pulsed and non - pulsed components are collected and the relation between their luminosities with spin down power and photon spectral index are determined . with these results in hand ,",
    "the pulsar wind nebula model is used to explain the occurrence of the tail - like emission morphology in geminga and psr b 1757 - 24 in  4 .",
    "finally , we summarize and conclude in the last section .",
    "a theoretical description of the interaction between a pulsar and its nebula , as applied to the crab nebula , was first outlined in a seminal paper by rees & gunn ( 1974 ) . in this model ,",
    "the central pulsar generates a highly relativistic particle dominated wind which passes through the medium in the supernova remnant , forming a shock front .",
    "the electrons and positrons in the shock are envisioned to be accelerated to a power law energy distribution and to radiate synchrotron photons in the downstream region .    since the magnetic field in the nebula derives from the pulsar , a magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) model , rather than a hydrodynamical model , of the pulsar wind nebula",
    "was required .",
    "such a model , in the steady state and spherically symmetric approximation , was developed by kennel & coroniti ( 1984 ) for the crab nebula .",
    "a hot relativistic positronic plasma flow was assumed to be terminated by a strong mhd shock , decelerating the flow and producing a non - thermal distribution of electrons .",
    "the magnetization parameter , @xmath17 , introduced to describe the efficiency for conversion of energy contained in the pulsar wind into synchrotron radiation , was represented by the ratio of the electromagnetic energy flux to the particle kinetic energy flux defined as : = b^24n_w mc^2 . here",
    "@xmath18 is the particle number density , @xmath19 is the magnetic field , @xmath20 is the lorentz factor of relativistic particles in the wind , @xmath21 is the particle mass , and @xmath22 is the speed of light . as pointed out by kennel & coroniti ( 1984 ) , the magnetization parameter must be small ( for the crab nebula , @xmath23 ) in order that sufficient compression occurs in the shock for transformation of the bulk flow energy to random particle motion and to the subsequent production of the observed synchrotron radiation .",
    "since the magnetic energy density must dominate the particle energy density just inside the light cylinder , the wind nebula must have evolved from a high @xmath17 to a low @xmath17 state to produce the observed properties .",
    "the manner in which this transformation takes place is central for detailed pulsar wind models and is not understood in detail .",
    "nevertheless , the low @xmath17 model can account for the basic high energy properties of the crab , including the position of the optical wisps , the spectrum of the nebula , and the size of the nebula as a function of wavelength ( van den bergh & pritchet 1989 ) .",
    "in the present paper , we concentrate on the x - ray properties of the pulsar wind nebula , using a simple one zone model similar to that developed by chevalier ( 2000 ) for a description of the wind interaction with the surrounding medium in a variety of environments . although the model does not provide a description of the spatial details associated with equatorial tori and polar jets observed in _",
    "chandra _ studies of young pulsar wind nebulae , it can explain the global x - ray properties of the nebula to a first approximation .",
    "in general , the energy in the shock waves is stored in the magnetic field as well as in the proton ( ion ) and electron particle components .",
    "we assume that the fractional energy density of the magnetic field , @xmath24 , is @xmath25 ( kennel & coroniti 1984 ) .",
    "provided that the spin down power is eventually carried away by pulsar wind particles and assuming equipartition of energy between the electrons and protons , the fractional energy densities in the proton and electron components should satisfy @xmath26 . for a given @xmath24 in the shock , the magnetic field at the shock termination radius ,",
    "@xmath27 is estimated as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the spin down power of the pulsar . here ,",
    "@xmath30 and @xmath31 are the spin period and its derivative , and @xmath32 is the moment of inertia of the neutron star ( @xmath33 ) .    at the shock front , the electrons attain a power law distribution corresponding to @xmath34 for @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the lorentz factor and @xmath37 . an estimate for @xmath38",
    "can be obtained by equating the synchrotron cooling timescale to the electron acceleration timescale .",
    "the former timescale is given by @xmath39 , and the latter timescale is given by @xmath40 , leading to @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the electron mass and @xmath43 is the thompson cross section .",
    "the synchrotron power of an electron with lorentz factor @xmath36 is ( blumenthal & gould 1970 ) p()=43_t c^2b^2 8 .",
    "following chevalier ( 2000 ) , the total rate of particles ejected by pulsars at the lorentz factor @xmath36 is ( chevalier 2000 ) ( ) = ( p-1)_m^p-1(_wmc^2)^-1 ^-p . the resulting total number of radiating particles becomes @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is a characteristic timescale . for a young pulsar with a supernova remnant similar to the crab , @xmath45 is identified with the age of the nebula while for old pulsars or millisecond pulsars , @xmath45 is comparable to the flow timescale within the nebula .",
    "thus , at the emitting frequency of an electron @xmath46 , the luminosity of the particle is about @xmath47 which should be less than @xmath1 .",
    "the detailed properties of the x - ray nebula are a function of @xmath48 , @xmath24 , @xmath27 , @xmath1 , and the two critical frequencies @xmath49 and @xmath50 where @xmath49 is the frequency radiated by the electrons with the lorentz factor of @xmath51 , and",
    "_ c=18em_ec/ _ t^2 t^2 b^3 is the electron synchrotron cooling frequency ( see chevalier 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "the x - ray luminosity and spectral index depend on the inequality between @xmath52 and @xmath50 . for typical values of @xmath53 and @xmath54 g",
    ", @xmath55 hz is always less than @xmath52 . in this case",
    ", the x - ray luminosity from the total emission of particles per unit frequency can be calculated according to the synchrotron spectral profiles which have been presented in figure 1 of the paper by sari , piran & narayan ( 1998 ) . for @xmath56",
    ", the luminosity per unit frequency can be obtained following equations ( 7 ) and ( 8) of sari , piran & narayan ( 1998 ) l_(_m/ _ c)^-1/2 ( /_m)^-p/2l_,max , where @xmath57 , and @xmath58 hz .",
    "this expression corresponds to the fast cooling regime , and is equivalent to equation ( 9 ) in chevalier ( 2000 ) reflecting our use of the same form of particle number injection rate by a pulsar ( see equation 3 in this section ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath59 ( denoted as slow cooling ) , the synchrotron x - ray luminosity is estimated as ( sari , piran & narayan 1998 ) l_(/_m)^ -(p-1)/2l_,max .",
    "it can be seen that the x - ray luminosity in the fast cooling regime is larger than that in the slow cooling regime by a factor @xmath60 if @xmath52 is in the slow cooling regime . since the range of @xmath5 due to shock acceleration lies between 2 and 3 ( see achterberg et al .",
    "2001 ; lemoine & pelletier 2003 and references therein ) , the photon index in the slow cooling regime is expected to lie in the range from 1.5 to 2 whereas the photon index in the fast cooling regime is expected to be in the range of 2 to 2.5 .      within the theoretical framework ,",
    "the energy of the electrons is converted to x - ray radiation solely at the shock termination radius . for pulsar motion which is subsonic ,",
    "the determination of this radius is obtained via the balance between the wind ram pressure and total magnetic and particle pressure within the nebula ( rees & gunn 1974 ) . in this case , the wind bubble will be nearly centered about the position of the pulsar .",
    "rees & gunn ( 1974 ) estimated @xmath61 cm , which is consistent with the size of the inner x - ray ring of the crab nebula ( @xmath62 pc , see kennel & coroniti 1984 ; weisskopf et al .",
    "the termination shock picture is not necessarily restricted to slowly moving pulsars since even for pulsars moving at several hundred km s@xmath63 the motion can be subsonic in , for example , regions where the gas has been heated to temperatures of @xmath64 k by a supernova shock .",
    "the radius of the termination shock can be estimated as : r_s ( b^2c)^1/2~610 ^ 14_34 ^ 1/2b_mg^-1 cm , where @xmath65 is the pulsar spin - down power in units of @xmath66 ergs s@xmath63 and @xmath67 is the magnetic field strength in the nebula in milligauss . with the observed values of the crab pulsar and its nebula ( @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) , consistency of the shock radius",
    "is easily achieved .    for supersonic motion ,",
    "the nebula will form a bow shock morphology . in this case ,",
    "the termination shock radius is given by the balance of the ram pressure between the wind particles and the medium at the head of the bow shock : = 12_ism v_p^2 , where @xmath70 is the density of the interstellar medium and @xmath71 is the pulsar s proper motion velocity .",
    "the termination shock radius is given as : r_s ( 2_ism v_p^2c)^1/2~310 ^ 16_34 ^ 1/2n_1 ^ -1/2v_p,100 ^ -1 cm , where @xmath72 , and @xmath73 are the number density in the interstellar medium in units of 1 particle @xmath74 and the pulsar space velocity in units of 100 km s@xmath63 . as an example , caraveo et al .",
    "( 2003 ) recently discovered a bow shock structure coincident with the geminga pulsar based on observations obtained with _ xmm - newton_. an estimate of the termination radius for geminga follows from its spin down power , @xmath75 , distance of @xmath76 pc , and proper motion velocity of @xmath77 km  s@xmath63 ( bignami & caraveo 1993 ) , leading to a radius of @xmath78 cm which is consistent with the observational constraint on geminga s compact x - ray nebula .    the general features of the emission region surrounding rotation powered pulsars in the galaxy will be bracketed by these two wind nebula morphologies . since the range in magnetic field strengths in the shock can vary from @xmath79 g to as high as @xmath80 g in the vela nebula and @xmath81 g in the crab nebula for the very young pulsars within supernova remnants , a range in the conversion efficiency of the spin down energy into nebula luminosity",
    "is expected .",
    "the relation between the nebula x - ray luminosity and the pulsar s spin down power will be deferred until  3 .",
    "in the above we have discussed the pulsar wind nebula models in different contexts within a one - zone approximation .",
    "the luminosities and spectral properties of the nebulae can be determined by eqs .",
    "( 5 ) and ( 6 ) in the fast and slow cooling regime respectively . in the fast cooling case ,",
    "the efficiency of converting spin down power to nebula luminosity is higher than that in the slow cooling case . assuming that @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 ( see bednarz & ostrowski 1998 ) , the ratio of the x - ray luminosity , @xmath85 , to the spin down power at @xmath58 hz can be estimated as @xmath86 for the fast cooling case and @xmath87 for the slow cooling case if @xmath88 s , and @xmath89 g. the spectral properties in these two regimes differ since the photon index in x - rays is @xmath90 , and @xmath91 for fast and slow cooling respectively .",
    "since @xmath5 varies from 2 to 3 , @xmath92 ( slow cooling ) and @xmath93 ( fast cooling )",
    ". these are typical of the photon indices of observed x - ray nebulae ( see table 1 of chevalier 2000 ) .",
    "as described in  2.1 , the fast and slow cooling regimes are distinguished by the x - ray and cooling frequencies . since the cooling frequency is dependent on the magnetic field and the flow time scale of the nebula , it is possible that different regions of the nebula may correspond to different cooling regimes .",
    "for example , the inner region of the nebula may correspond to the slow cooling regime , whereas the fast cooling may be more appropriate in the outer region of the nebula . in this case , the power law index of the x - ray spectrum will steepen by @xmath94 between the inner and outer region .",
    "this may be consistent with the spectral results from the high spatial resolution observations of the nebulae surrounding psr b1823 - 13 obtained with the _ xmm - newton _ satellite ( gaensler et al .",
    "2003a ) .    because the spatial resolution of current x - ray detectors is limited the emission from compact nebulae of size @xmath95 may be contaminated by the non - thermal x - ray emission from the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "however , the pulsar magnetospheric radiation is assumed to be pulsed , whereas the nebula contribution is non - pulsed .",
    "therefore , the separation of the non - thermal x - ray emission into its pulsed and non - pulsed components is essential for determining their relative contributions .",
    "since the pulsed and non - pulsed emission components originate from different regions , their x - ray luminosities are not expected to exhibit a similar relationship to the spin down power .",
    "for example , wang & zhao ( 2004 ) recently found that the correlation of the observed pulsed x - ray luminosity with spin down power is not well matched to the linear form found by becker & trmper ( 1997 ) for the total luminosity in the rosat energy band ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev , see figure 8 of wang & zhao 2004 ) .",
    "we note , however , that studies in this lower energy band are incomplete since pulsars can emit a significant fraction of their luminosity at higher energies . to examine the x - ray luminosity- spin down power relation at higher energies ( 2 - 10 kev ) , kawai et al .",
    "( 1998 ) selected a sample of bright nebulae and found a relation in the form @xmath96 .",
    "since the individual components were not separately analyzed , the result was insufficient to establish the relation between the pulsed or non - pulsed emission with spin down power .      over 50 rotation powered pulsars",
    "have been detected in the x - ray band ( becker & aschenbach 2002 ) , but only a fraction of them have been resolved with pulsed non - thermal components . here , we have selected 23 x - ray pulsars with both pulsed and non - pulsed emission measurements obtained from the asca mission ( listed in table 1 ) .",
    "the pulsed and non - pulsed x - ray luminosities of these selected pulsars are directly taken from the cited references .",
    "this pulsar sample includes 19 normal pulsars and 4 millisecond pulsars whose observational data are taken from the recent references ( see table 1 ) . since the asca satellite does not have high spatial resolution , the x - ray luminosity of the pulsars in the asca field is composed of emission from the pulsar s magnetosphere and compact pulsar wind nebula . for reference ,",
    "the total pulsed plus non - pulsed x - ray luminosity in the asca energy range ( 2 - 10 kev ) is plotted versus spin down power in figure 1 .",
    "a correlation is found which is consistent with the form @xmath11 found by saito ( 1998 ) , but the best fit form of this correlation is found to be @xmath98 . here , the error in the power law exponent represents @xmath99 corresponding to the scatter in the observed data points , which may reflect variations in @xmath48 , @xmath24 , @xmath20 , and uncertainties in distance from pulsar to pulsar .",
    "our best fit power law relation is consistent with the conclusion of possenti et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , who used a sample of 39 pulsars observed mainly by rosat and data from asca , rxte , bepposax , chandra and xmm - newton .",
    "although possenti et al .",
    "( 2002 ) considered their result ( @xmath100 ) statistically unacceptable , our result is not subject to the uncertainties associated with the normalization of different satellite data to obtain the x - ray luminosity between 2 - 10 kev ( cf .",
    "table 1 of possenti et al .",
    "2002 ) , for which the extrapolation relied on the uncertain photon index in the rosat energy band .",
    "the x - ray luminosity associated with the pulsed emission component is illustrated versus spin down power in figure 2 .",
    "a correlation separate from the total luminosity is found which is inconsistent with either the form @xmath101 or @xmath102 . the best fitting function to the data",
    "is found to be @xmath103 , which significantly deviates from the @xmath104 power law relation proposed by saito ( 1998 ) .",
    "such a relation is consistent with the relation @xmath105 derived from the theoretical x - ray magnetospheric emission model of cheng & zhang ( 1999 ) , however , this latter result is not without uncertainties since the inclination angle of the magnetic field with respect to the rotation axis and the viewing angle are not well determined .",
    "the observed conversion efficiencies are found to range from @xmath106 , which is not in conflict with model predictions ( cheng , gil & zhang 1998 ; cheng & zhang 1999 ) .",
    "a correlation is also found to exist between the non - pulsed x - ray luminosity and the spin down power as shown in figure 3 .",
    "the data points are consistent with the previous asca relation of the type @xmath107 , but the correlation is also consistent with @xmath108 .",
    "upon comparison to the results from fig .",
    "1 , this power law relation is a consequence of the fact that the pulsar emission in the asca sample is dominated by the non - pulsed radiation component . the conversion efficiency for the non - pulsed component overlaps with that for the pulsed component ,",
    "but extends to efficiencies as high as 0.1 .",
    "generally , the x - ray luminosity of pulsar wind nebulae ( chevalier 2000 ) is a nonlinear function of the spin down power .",
    "as can be seen from equation ( 9 ) of chevalier ( 2000 ) , the nebula s x - ray luminosity follows from l_x _ e^p-1 _",
    "b^(p-2)/4_w^p-2r_s^-(p-2)/2 ^(p+2)/4 . here , @xmath48 and @xmath24",
    "are assumed to be constant , but @xmath109 from eqs .",
    "( 7 ) and ( 9 ) .",
    "although the above equation corresponds to the fast cooling regime , the dependence of @xmath110 on @xmath1 for the slow cooling regime is unchanged because the ratio of the x - ray luminosities in these two regimes depends only on the cooling frequency @xmath50 , which is independent of @xmath1 .",
    "we note that @xmath20 also depends on the spin down power so the explicit dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath1 remains to be theoretically determined .",
    "to estimate this dependence we make use of the results of ruderman ( 1981 ) and arons ( 1983 ) , who argued that large fluxes of protons ( ions ) could also be extracted from the neutron star and accelerated in the parallel electric field in the magnetosphere .",
    "the initial poynting flux can be converted into particle thermal and kinetic energy well within the termination radius . since",
    "both electrons and protons are basically accelerated by the low frequency electromagnetic wave generated by the pulsar , they will be accelerated to the same relativistic speed as they are bound by the strong electrostatic force .",
    "hence , the lorentz factor of the electrons and protons are the same , leading to the result that the protons may have carried away most of the spin down power ( coroniti 1990 ) .",
    "thus , we can obtain a form for the spin down power from ~n _ wm_pc^2 , where @xmath111 is the outflow current from the surface .",
    "this current should be of the order of the goldreich - julian current ( goldreich & julian 1969 ) given as @xmath112 . since @xmath113 , we find @xmath114 , leading to @xmath115 .",
    "therefore , we obtain the relation @xmath116 , where @xmath5 generally varies between 2 and 3 .",
    "the relation deduced from the non - pulsed x - ray luminosity and spin down power of observed pulsars may result from a relatively high electron energy index in the nebula .",
    "the spectral observations of the x - ray emission provide additional evidence in support of the pulsar wind nebula interpretation .",
    "in particular , the photon indices of both the pulsed and non - pulsed emission components , where determined , for x - ray pulsars are listed in table 2 . in this data compilation ,",
    "the observational results are taken from the asca data and also from the recent observations by _ bepposax , chandra _ and _ xmm - newton_. in figure 4 , the photon index of the pulsed component is plotted versus the ratio of the isotropic pulsed x - ray luminosity to pulsar spin down power , @xmath117 .",
    "the results reveal that the photon index of the pulsed emission component generally varies from 1.1 - 1.9 ( except for psr 0218 + 4232 ) .",
    "such a range is consistent with the pulsed component originating in the pulsar s magnetosphere ( wang et al .",
    "1998 ; cheng , gil , & zhang 1998 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath118 vary over a wide range from @xmath119 to @xmath120 with no apparent correlation of the photon index with respect to efficiency .",
    "we note that the actual pulsed x - ray luminosities depend on the beaming of the pulse and , therefore , the efficiency of spin down power to pulsed x - ray luminosity is uncertain .",
    "the real efficiency may only scatter around an apparent efficiency , which is based on an assumed constant solid angle . unless the beaming conspires with the photon index to produce a correlation , the rough distribution of the data presented in figure 4 would not be expected to change . in summary , the efficiency and the photon index do not appear to show any correlation , which is consistent with the model predictions of cheng & zhang ( 1999 ) .",
    "on the other hand , cheng & zhang ( 1999 ) suggest that the photon index sensitively depends on the local properties of the stellar magnetic field .",
    "we also illustrate the relation between the efficiency of pulsar spin down power to non - pulsed x - ray luminosity , @xmath121 , and the photon index of the non - pulsed component in figure 5 .",
    "it can be seen that the photon index of the non - pulsed emission component shows two distinct regimes .",
    "in particular , there is a grouping of data points with @xmath122 for low efficiencies ( @xmath123 ) and a separate grouping of data points with @xmath124 at higher efficiencies .",
    "this tendency may reflect a larger photon index in the fast cooling regime in comparison to the slow cooling regime as discussed in  2.3 .",
    "specifically , we showed that the fast cooling regime and slow cooling regime is separated by @xmath125 or @xmath126 where @xmath50 is the cooling frequency and @xmath52 is the observed x - ray frequency respectively . in the former regime ,",
    "the photon indices are in the range from 2 - 2.5 and in the latter regime , the photon indices range from 1.5 to 2 . typically , the slow cooling region has a lower efficiency than the fast cooling region by a factor @xmath127 .",
    "the actual efficiency of an individual pulsar depends on its corresponding parameters ( e.g. @xmath128 ) .",
    "evidence in favor of such a relation is suggested by the difference between the crab , which is in the fast cooling regime with an efficiency of @xmath129 and geminga , which is in the slow cooling regime with an efficiency of @xmath130 .      in table 3 ,",
    "the termination radii derived from the images of some identified pulsar wind nebulae are listed .",
    "although the determination of the radius is imprecise , we have adopted two procedures for its estimation . for the nebulae which have ring structures ( e.g. , crab nebula ) ,",
    "the termination radius is chosen as the size of the inner ring .",
    "on the other hand , for the extended sources with a bright point - like central sources , the termination radius is taken to be the size corresponding to the scale in which about 90% of the observed counts are included .",
    "for comparison , the theoretical termination radii for some nebulae are estimated according to eqs .",
    "( 7 ) ( for the crab nebula ) and ( 9 ) ( other nebulae ) as discussed in  2.2 and also listed in table 3 .    with the knowledge of the termination radius of the nebulae",
    ", the x - ray luminosity can be estimated assuming typical values for the parameters ( @xmath20 , @xmath5 , @xmath48 , @xmath24 ) . the observed and estimated x - ray luminosities of these compact nebulae are given in table 3 .",
    "for these estimates , we have taken @xmath27 as the observed values , and assumed @xmath131 , and @xmath132 for all pulsars .",
    "we find that the model luminosities and the observed luminosities are in rough agreement with each other to within a factor of 4 , which taking into account the possible variations of these parameters amongst the pulsars , suggests that the simple one - zone model provides a reasonable approximation for the x - ray luminosity level .",
    "the x - ray emitting region with a characteristic frequency ( @xmath133 ) may exhibit a tail - like spatial structure provided that the pulsar velocity exceeds that of the termination shock front and the nebula magnetic field is sufficiently low . in this case",
    ", the distance traversed by the pulsar within the synchrotron cooling timescale can be taken as a lower limit of the elongation length .",
    "specifically , the synchrotron cooling time in the x - ray band is @xmath134 s where @xmath135 is the magnetic field in the emission region in milligauss .",
    "thus , the typical cooling time is @xmath136 s for @xmath137 , and the length of the x - ray elongated feature is about @xmath138 cm for a pulsar moving at a velocity of 100 km s@xmath63 with respect to the interstellar medium .",
    "the x - ray images of some pulsar wind nebulae , indeed , reveal extensive x - ray tails . in table 3 , several sources with x - ray tail features are included .",
    "seven cases are thought to be the consequence of a bow shock formed by the high velocity pulsar ( e.g. , geminga , psr b1823 - 13 , b1757 - 24 , b1957 - 20 , j1747 - 2958 , j1124 - 5916 and b1853 + 01 ) .",
    "the two pulsars j1930 + 1852 and b0453 - 685 exhibit elongated structures and may also be bow shock structures .",
    "on the other hand , the crab and vela nebulae exhibit an outflow structure ( x - ray jet ) .",
    "geminga is one of the most studied pulsars because it is one of the very nearby pulsars and is the first pulsar detected in optical , x - ray and gamma - ray , but not in radio ( bignami & caraveo 1996 ) wavelengths .",
    "based on asca observations , saito ( 1997a ) found that the non - pulsed x - ray luminosity was @xmath139 s@xmath63 and the pulsed x - ray luminosity was @xmath140 s@xmath63 in the 2 - 10 kev band .",
    "based on more recent xmm - newton observations , caraveo et al .",
    "( 2004 ) has reported the detection of a power law component ( @xmath141 s@xmath63 in 2 - 8 kev band ) , which consists of the pulsed as well as the non - pulsed component . the pulsed component in 2 - 6",
    "kev is @xmath142 , which is consistent with asca observation .",
    "however , it is still not clear if the non - pulsed component originates from the pulsar or the nebula .",
    "the recent _ chandra _ observations of the geminga pulsar show a x - ray bow shock structure(caraveo et al .",
    "2003 ) . the image of the field including the geminga pulsar reveals a compact point - like x - ray source of size 20 \" or ( @xmath143 cm ) with two elongated tails extending to 2 ( caraveo et al .",
    "since the x - ray tails have a non - thermal x - ray spectrum ( @xmath144 ) , these features may be produced by synchrotron emission in the bow shock between the pulsar wind and the interstellar medium .",
    "the spin down power of the geminga pulsar is relatively low compared to other pulsars , with @xmath145 . assuming a proper motion velocity of @xmath146120 kms@xmath63 ( bignami & caraveo 1993 ) and a number density of 1 particle @xmath74 in the interstellar medium , the termination shock radius of the pulsar wind nebula is @xmath147 cm .",
    "this scale is consistent with the observational constraint on the compact x - ray nebula for an assumed distance of @xmath76 pc .",
    "the point - like source has a x - ray luminosity of @xmath148 in the energy range from 0.3 to 5 kev , and the total luminosity from the two tails is @xmath149 ergs s@xmath63 ( caraveo et al .",
    "the pulsed and non - pulsed emission of the point - like source was not resolved in the _ xmm - newton _ observations , but the results from  3 ( see table 1 ) , reveal that the non - pulsed luminosity of geminga is @xmath150 . interpreting this luminosity as arising from the compact x - ray nebula , we find that @xmath151 which is low compared to other pulsar wind nebula .",
    "we suggest that the nebula is in the slow cooling regime where the photon spectral index , @xmath91 .",
    "the observed photon index of the tail is 1.6 , corresponding to @xmath152 , and its observed length ( @xmath153 cm ) suggests that the magnetic field of the surrounding medium is weak ( @xmath154 g , see also caraveo et al .",
    "thus , the inferred fractional magnetic energy density is @xmath155 . assuming a fractional electron energy density of @xmath156 yields a nebula luminosity of @xmath157 in the 2 - 10 kev band , which modestly overestimates the contributions from the compact nebula and x - ray tails by a factor of @xmath158 .",
    "another example where the model can be compared to the observational data is the x - ray tail associated with psr b1757 - 24 observed by kaspi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) with the _ chandra _ satellite .",
    "psr b1757 - 24 is a 124 ms radio pulsar discovered near the supernova remnant ( snr ) g5.4 - 1.2 ( manchester et al .",
    "1985 ) with a spin down power @xmath159 ( manchester et al . 1991 ) . assuming an association between the pulsar and g5.4 - 1.2 , and that the pulsar s characteristic age is a good estimate of its true age , a proper motion of 75 mas yr@xmath63 is inferred .",
    "this corresponds to a transverse space velocity of @xmath160 km s@xmath63 for a distance of 5 kpc ( frail , kassim , & weiler 1994 ) .",
    "however , recent interferometric observations have failed to detect the implied proper motion ( gaensler & frail 2000 ) , which suggests that the pulsar is older than its characteristic age or that the assumed pulsar birth place is incorrect . here , we take the proper motion velocity of psr b1757 - 24 to be @xmath161 km s@xmath63 ( gaensler & frail 2000 ) .",
    "the observed 2 - 10 kev luminosity is about @xmath162 corresponding to a conversion efficiency of @xmath163 , with the x - ray tail extending to @xmath164 ( 0.5 pc for the distance of 5 kpc ) . the observed photon index , @xmath165 , yielding @xmath152 in the slow cooling regime .",
    "assuming an interstellar medium number density , @xmath166 @xmath74 , the termination shock radius is @xmath167 cm , with the known velocity @xmath161 km s@xmath63 . taking the typical pulsar wind nebula parameters , @xmath168 ( corresponding to @xmath169 g at @xmath27 ) , and @xmath170",
    ", we find the x - ray luminosity from 2 - 10 kev is @xmath171 using the one - zone model .",
    "the predicted x - ray tail length is given by @xmath172 cm .",
    "both these estimates for the x - ray luminosity and tail length are in approximate accord with the observed values .",
    "the non - thermal non - pulsed x - ray emission of rotation powered pulsars has been investigated in the context of emission from a pulsar wind nebula .",
    "we have confirmed that this emission can significantly contribute to the total x - ray emission , thereby , increasing the x - ray emission above that produced in the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "a reexamination of asca data for pulsars separated into the non - pulsed and pulsed emission components indicates that their non - thermal components , individually , are correlated with spin down power . in particular , the dependence is steeper for the non - pulsed component with @xmath173 as compared to the relation , @xmath174 for the pulsed component .",
    "our results are similar to that discovered by becker & trmper(1997 ) , who found that the non - thermal ( pulsed and non - pulsed ) component satisfied the linear relation , @xmath175 , based on rosat data in 0.1 - 2.4 kev range . in this paper",
    ", we have used the asca data in the 2 - 10 kev range , which includes the contribution of the additional thermal pulsed component with @xmath176 kev from the polar cap ( cheng & zhang 1999 ) . in this case , the dependence of the x - ray luminosity on spin down power is steeper . because of the poor angular resolution of asca",
    ", the possible contribution of non - thermal non - pulsed emission from the magnetosphere is mixed in with that of the nebula .    within the framework of a one zone model for the pulsar wind developed by chevalier ( 2000 ) , the power law relation between the non - pulsed luminosity and spin down power provides an important diagnostic for the electron energy distribution in the shock resulting from the interaction of the relativistic wind with the interstellar medium .",
    "specifically , @xmath177 where @xmath5 is the power law index of the electron energy distribution , suggesting that the index characterizing these pulsars is relatively high , @xmath178 . the observational results also show that the conversion efficiency of spin down power to x - ray luminosity is a function of spin down power varying from @xmath119 to 0.1 .",
    "the efficiencies in the lower ( upper ) end of the range can be understood in terms of emission in the slow ( fast ) cooling regime where the x - ray frequency is less ( greater ) than the electron synchrotron cooling frequency .",
    "the spectra from pulsar wind nebulae are distinctly non - thermal , described by a photon power law index , @xmath179 or @xmath180 for the fast or slow cooling regime respectively .",
    "this implies a correlation between the photon index and efficiency of conversion of spin down power to non - pulsed x - ray luminosity with steeper photon power law indices associated with higher conversion efficiencies .",
    "although the photon power law indices inferred from the pulsars studied have large uncertainties , there are hints from the observed data that such a correlation exists .",
    "we note that the low values of @xmath6 and @xmath181 inferred for the extended emission observed from geminga and b 1757 - 24 are consistent with such an interpretation .",
    "future observed determinations of the photon power law indices could further verify this correlation , thereby , providing an additional diagnostic tool for probing the pulsar and its environment .",
    "finally , the pulsar wind nebula interpretation may also apply to the spatially extended x - ray emission observed in binary systems containing a pulsar .",
    "for example , the extended x - ray emission associated with the millisecond pulsar b1957 + 20 ( stappers et al .",
    "2003 ) may be interpreted within such a framework .",
    "the application of such models to recycled pulsars in the galaxy will be the subject of a future investigation .",
