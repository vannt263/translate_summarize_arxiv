    "perhaps the primary goal of all experiments studying the highest energy cosmic rays is to find the source of these particles . while circumstantial evidence may favor one type of source over another , demonstration of a clear correlation between the direction of cosmic rays and their sources",
    "is arguably essential .",
    "unfortunately for electrically charged cosmic rays , galactic magnetic fields , and for the highest energy cosmic rays extra - galactic magnetic fields , cause angular deflections that can blur the correlation between cosmic ray arrival direction and source direction . if the sources as viewed from the earth are extended@xcite the problem is even more difficult . unless otherwise noted , for this paper we assume compact ( point - like ) sources for the highest energy cosmic rays .",
    "if the angular blurring from magnetic fields is small@xcite ( _ i.e. _ not significantly greater than the experimental angular resolution ) and/or for neutral primaries , then experiments should observe cosmic rays that cluster in arrival direction@xcite , and/or that correlate with potential astronomical ( _ e.g. _ bl lac ) sources@xcite . for nearby sources , where experiments should detect multiple cosmic rays / source ,",
    "event clusters provide bounds on the cosmic ray source density@xcite potentially favoring one type of source for the highest energy cosmic rays over another .",
    "however at this time the situation is less than clear as some results@xcite question the significance of the reported clusters and/or some of the bl lac correlations@xcite .",
    "if deflections of charged cosmic rays by extra - galactic magnetic fields are not small@xcite , then lower energy , @xmath1 , cosmic rays should experience the greatest angular deflections .",
    "unfortunately small experiment data samples and a cosmic ray flux @xmath2 have often caused studies to retain cosmic rays to energies , @xmath3 , well below gzk@xcite energies@xcite .",
    "furthermore deflections of the highest energy cosmic rays even by our galactic magnetic field can be substantial@xcite .",
    "as magnetic deflections scale proportional to the charge of the primary cosmic ray , nuclei in the cosmic rays may have significant deflections .",
    "although most searches have looked for clustering and/or source correlations on small angular scales , studies at larger angular scales have also found evidence for clustering and/or source correlations@xcite .",
    "certainly the angular scale of cosmic ray clusters and the magnitude , and thus relevance , of the deflections of ultra - high energy cosmic rays by magnetic fields is not universally agreed to at this time .    in the future ,",
    "significantly larger data samples will allow analyses to increase @xmath3 while retaining the number of observed cosmic rays / source ( for nearby sources ) @xmath4 .",
    "however another possibility is to exploit catalogs of candidate sources . with a catalog of source directions ,",
    "cosmic rays can be effectively correlated with sources even when if magnetic field deflections are `` not small '' and/or when the the number of observed cosmic rays per source is @xmath5 allowing searches with existing data samples .",
    "that said , catalog based studies are limited by the completeness of the source catalog and the relevance ( or not ) of that class of astronomical source to the production of the highest energy cosmic rays .",
    "often conjectured astrophysical sources include gamma ray bursts , grbs , and/or active galactic nuclei , agns@xcite .",

    "our comparison of ultra - high energy cosmic rays and a catalog of agns includes three components : the rxte catalog of agns , the agasa list of cosmic rays , and a monte carlo sample of uniformly distributed cosmic rays generated to match the experimental acceptance of agasa .",
    "the catalog of nearby agns@xcite results from the rossi x - ray timing explorer , rxte , all - sky slew survey@xcite sensitive to sources of hard x - rays ( 3 - 20kev ) .",
    "the survey excluded the galactic plane ( @xmath6 ) but covered @xmath7% of the remaining sky .",
    "x - ray sources were located to better than @xmath8 and then correlated with known astronomical objects . the efficiency for agn identification",
    "was estimated to be @xmath9 with somewhat higher efficiency for northern agns ( @xmath10 ) and somewhat lower efficiency for southern agns ( @xmath11)@xcite .",
    "the resulting catalog provides source directions and probable source distances and intrinsic x - ray luminosities , @xmath12 .",
    "the catalog is best for nearby agns as rxte signal thresholds significantly reduced the efficiency for detecting distant sources ; additional details are given below .",
    "the list of ultra - high energy cosmic rays comes from published agasa data @xcite .",
    "the monte carlo sample of uniformly distributed cosmic rays was generated according to a @xmath13 distribution in local zenith angle , @xmath14 , and uniform in local azimuth .",
    "events were then transformed to celestial right ascension and declination assuming constant detector aperture with time .",
    "correlations , between the agasa events and the catalog of agns from rxte , would appear as an excess at small angular separations in comparison to the monte carlo sample of simulated cosmic rays . to be clear ,",
    "define unit vectors in the directions of cosmic rays , @xmath15 , agns , v@xmath16 , and monte carlo simulated cosmic rays , @xmath17 . a correlation _ signal _",
    "should then appear _ near 1.0 _ in the distribution of _ dot_-products :  @xmath18v@xmath16   ( if magnetic field deflections are modest ) .",

    "a few choices have been made in the comparison of agasa data and catalog of agns from rxte .",
    "these are described here .",
    "0.5 cm    the agasa data have energies , @xmath23eev and populate values of declination : @xmath24 .",
    "as noted above , the steep cosmic rays spectrum , @xmath2 , and modest number of events : 57 with @xmath25eev and 29 ( just over half ) with @xmath26 led us to consider three ( overlapping ) bins in energy : @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29eev .",
    "the last was to see if there are any correlations with the agasa super - gzk events .",
    "except for the @xmath29eev selection , most of the cosmic rays are predicted , at least under the assumption of proton primaries@xcite , to originate at values of redshift , @xmath30 mpc ] ; see fig.[fig : berezinski ] .    0.5 cm    to match the agasa acceptance , we selected agns with @xmath24 .",
    "we have also made selections on the redshift of the agns to consider sources only with rxte source detection efficiency @xmath31% .",
    "the estimate of the rxte source detection efficiency involves two issues :    1 .   the rxte instrument source detection threshold ( _ i.e. _ the selection bias ) _ vs _ redshift from fig.1 of ref.@xcite , 2 .   the number density of agns _ vs _ redshift and intrinsic x - ray luminosity from table 2 of ref.@xcite",

    "we require that the x - ray 3 - 20kev intrinsic luminosity in ergs / s , to 2 - 8kev intrinsic luminosities , @xmath32 in ergs / s using : @xmath33 ; private communication from sergey sazonov . ] , @xmath34 ergs / s , to match the rxte data . with this intrinsic luminosity threshold",

    "broadline_-agn number density is @xmath39 mpc@xmath36 .    combining the rxte detection threshold with our definition of two categories of agn ( above )",

    "if this correlation is valid , then it could provide experimental information to bound the magnetic deflections of extra - galactic cosmic rays .    to see if the _ all_-agn category excesses are consistent with _",

    "87% estimated completeness factor ; 3 .",
    "@xmath54% estimated average _",
    "all_-agn source detection efficiency ( from fig.[fig : agneffic ] ) .",
    "this yields an lower bound estimate for the _ all_-agn rxte efficiency of @xmath55% .",
    "however for the _ all_-agn category ( only 5 sources , see fig.[fig : allagndisplay ] ) it is likely that the global ( redshift independent ) rxte efficiency factors are not appropriate mpc@xmath36 ( see above ) and the rxte global efficiency@xcite of @xmath56% , the predicted number of nearby ( @xmath40 ) rxte agns is approximated half those observed .",
    "while the small number of agns makes this weak statistically , it is nevertheless consistent with : a rxte global efficiency of @xmath57% for nearby ( @xmath40 ) agns and/or with a local over - density of agns .",
    "although these estimates were based on the agn number density _ vs _ x - ray luminosity from ref.@xcite the agn number density _ vs",

    "thus the estimated number of cosmic rays from the @xmath58 region is obtained by dividing the excess counts , fig.[fig : allagnplot ] , by the _ all_-agn efficiencies to obtain : 2.8/0.77 @xmath59 2.8/0.50 or @xmath60 events and 4.0/0.77 @xmath59 4.0/0.50 or @xmath61 events respectively . as fractions of all the observed cosmic rays these are : @xmath60/57 ( or @xmath62% ) and @xmath61/29 ( or @xmath63% ) respectively .",
    "these fractions are somewhat , to significantly ( depending on the _ all_-agn rxte efficiency ) , in excess of typical gzk models assuming proton primaries , see fig.[fig : berezinski ] .",
