    "if a polymer is subjected to local step strain , i.e. , a small part of a polymer is made to undergo a relatively fast conformational change , during subsequent evolution the polymer will readjust itself in an attempt to relieve its strain . the local conformational change will alter the polymer s local chain tension ; and the new chain tension will be unable to maintain the polymer in equilibrium . in response to that , monomers will be pulled from ( or pushed away to ) the adjacent part of the polymer , thereby spreading the effect of the local strain . in time , the effect of the local strain will spread through the entire polymer along its backbone , before equilibrium conditions can be finally restored .",
    "studies on strain relaxation in collective polymeric systems are abundant in traditional polymer physics , such as for ( dilute / semi - dilute ) polymer solutions and for polymer melts @xcite . from this perspective ,",
    "how a single polymer relieves its local step strain may seem to be a purely theoretically motivated problem .",
    "however , experimentalists ability to manipulate polymeric systems at single polymer level  specially in the context of biological polymers , or biopolymers  have rapidly grown in the last few years ; e.g. , dna separation in nanochannels @xcite , dynamics of rna polymerase @xcite , biopolymer translocation @xcite , packaging and ejection of bacteriophage dna during infection @xcite , surface desorption of polymers using a pulling force @xcite .",
    "such single polymer experiments have been continuously challenging polymer theorists ; one can almost claim that polymer physics at a single polymer level is being reborn through these recent developments .",
    "indeed , our motivation to study the response of single polymers to localized step strains , stem from the fact that there are systems whose dynamics are determined by the polymers local strain relaxation mechanism . take for example polymer translocation , where the polymer passes through a narrow pore in a membrane @xcite .",
    "a translocating polymer is composed of two polymer strands ( labeled a and b respectively ) , one on each side of the membrane .",
    "the only way the two strands interact with each other is through the pore : as the monomers translocate , they leave one strand to join the other .",
    "monomers leaving strand a locally increases the chain tension of strand a at the pore , and as they join strand b across the membrane , they reduce the chain tension of strand b , also locally at the pore . how the segments relieve these local strains determines the dynamics of translocation @xcite .",
    "similarly , in the case of polymer adsorption on a rigid surface , when a monomer gets adsorbed , it creates a local ( at the adsorbing surface ) step strain in the polymer , and the adsorption kinetics is governed by how the polymer relieves this strain @xcite .",
    "the fact that local step strain relaxations of a polymer is governed by a power - law in time can be argued on general theoretical grounds .",
    "let us consider the application of the step strain of magnitude @xmath7 at a given location ( say the @xmath8-th monomer ) of a polymer of length @xmath9 at @xmath10 .",
    "this strain will excite _ all _ fluctuation modes of the polymer .",
    "the amplitude @xmath11 of the @xmath12-th mode @xmath13 can be obtained from the equation @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "typically , in polymer physics , the @xmath12-th fluctuation mode of a polymer has an associated relaxation time @xmath16 for some @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the longest relaxation time of the polymer , corresponding to the slowest mode @xmath19 of the polymer ( @xmath20 for a rouse polymer , and @xmath21 for a zimm polymer ) .",
    "the subsequent evolution of this strain will then be given by @xmath22 .",
    "the local contribution of these summed over large number of exponentials at @xmath8 will yield a power - law , implying that @xmath23 for some @xmath24 , multiplied by the overall terminal exponential decay @xmath25 .",
    "such power - laws are often referred to as `` memory effects '' .",
    "the quantity @xmath24 , the exponent for the power - law , characterizes the response of single polymers to local step strains .",
    "for the two physical systems discussed above , namely polymer translocation and adsorption of polymers on rigid surfaces , it is the exponent @xmath24 that dictates the dynamics @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to report the exponent @xmath24 for phantom and self - avoiding polymers in three dimensions in the absence of hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "the specific way we create the local strain in the polymers is as follows . at a given location ( say the @xmath8-th monomer ) of an equilibrated polymer of length @xmath9",
    ", we inject @xmath26 crumpled monomers at @xmath10 , bringing its length to @xmath27 . following the monomer injection at @xmath10 , apart from the newly injected monomers , the polymer follows random walk ( or self - avoiding walk ) statistics , i.e. , the strain in the polymer is localized at monomer number @xmath8 . in the subsequent evolution of the polymer ,",
    "we then keep track of how these @xmath28 crumpled monomers unfold themselves , which yields us the exponent @xmath24 .",
    "note that the specific way we choose to create the local strain in the polymers is indeed motivated by the actual microscopic dynamics of polymer translocation or polymer adsorption on a rigid surface : as remarked above , for polymer translocation it is the addition or disappearance of monomers to the polymer segments on either side of the membrane that creates the local strain ( and similarly for the case of polymer adsorption on a rigid surface ) .",
    "we calculate @xmath24 for two different cases each for three - dimensional phantom and self - avoiding polymers : ( i ) polymers tethered at one end with the strain created at the point of tether , and ( ii ) free polymers with the strain created in the middle of the polymer .",
    "we derive that @xmath29 in both cases ; however , for the self - avoiding polymer we show that @xmath30 for case ( i ) , and @xmath31 for case ( ii ) . here",
    "@xmath5 is the flory exponent for the polymer , with value @xmath6 in three dimensions .",
    "we provide exact derivations for the @xmath2 strain relaxation behavior for the phantom polymer using the mode expansion method .",
    "the mode expansion method for a self - avoiding polymer is nonlinear , and hence similar theoretical derivation for @xmath24 for the self - avoiding polymer proves difficult to provide .",
    "only high - precision simulation data are therefore presented in support of the @xmath3 and the @xmath4 step strain - relaxation behaviors of the self - avoiding polymer .    although the problem of local step strain relaxation behavior in the polymers is motivated in this paper in view of polymer translocation and polymer adsorption , note that both physical processes correspond to the case ( i ) while the tether point lies on a rigid surface .",
    "the presence of the surface , in principle , can influence the strain relaxation mechanism , and alter the value of @xmath24 from its value in the absence of the surface .",
    "however , since in refs . @xcite it was shown  using a model that allowed direct observation of the local strain relaxation  that @xmath30 for a self - avoiding polymer for the case of ( i ) in the presence of a rigid surface as well , the result of this paper therefore implies that the local strain release mechanism for self - avoiding tethered polymers is unaffected by the presence of a surface at the tether point .",
    "note that recently , albeit indirectly , a different polymer model has confirmed that @xmath30 for a self - avoiding polymer for the case of ( i ) in the presence of a rigid surface @xcite , in support of refs .",
