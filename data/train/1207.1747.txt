    "extensive observations have shown that by the time a typical t tauri star is @xmath15 myr old its protostellar disk will retain insufficient carbon monoxide gas to be detectable with a radio telescope .",
    "stars with ages @xmath25 myr are virtually non - existent within @xmath1100 pc of earth ( zuckerman & song 2004 ; torres et al 2008 ) .",
    "thus , stars this close to earth with detectable gas - rich circumstellar disks are few and far between .",
    "co has been detected from three classical t tauri stars within 100 pc of earth : tw hya , v4046 sgr and mp mus ( kastner et al 2010 ; rodriguez et al 2010 ; and references therein ) .",
    "such stars , with likely ages in the range 7 - 12 myr , represent the oldest known examples of remnant gaseous protoplanetary disks around solar - type stars .    two dusty a - type stars near earth with gas - rich disks  49 cet and hd 21997  are quite different from classical t tauri stars . the circumstellar gas at 49 cet (= hr 451 & hip 7345 ) was discovered in 1995 and has warranted the attention of single and interferometric radio telescopes ( zuckerman et al 1995 ; dent et al 2005 ; hughes et al 2008 ) .",
    "the dust distribution has been investigated with high spatial resolution mid - infrared imaging ( wahhaj et al 2007 ) .",
    "the gas around hd 21997 (= hr 1082 & hip 16449 ) was discovered much more recently ( moor et al 2011 ) .",
    "49 cet and hd 21997 are , respectively , 59 and 72 pc from earth ( van leeuwen 2007 ) .",
    "hd 21997 is classified , reasonably securely , as a member the 30 myr old columba association ( moor et al 2006 ; torres et al 2008 ) .",
    "the age of 49 cet has been much more up in the air .",
    "the earliest estimates of this age were typically 8 - 10 myr and 8 myr is the age adopted in the interferometric study by hughes et al ( 2008 ) .",
    "with such a young age , no older than that of the three classical t tauri stars mentioned above , it was reasonable to interpret 49 cet as a star in transition between a protoplanetary and a debris disk .",
    "however , largely because they did not associate the galactic space motions ( uvw ) of 49 cet with any known young ( 8 - 100 myr old ) stellar moving group , rhee et al ( 2007 ) tentatively assigned an age of `` 20 ? '' myr to the star .",
    "based on the discussion that follows below , we believe that all previous age estimates for 49 cet are too young and that the star is actually a member of the 40 myr old argus association ( torres et al 2008 ; zuckerman et al 2011 ) .",
    "thus among main sequence stars , 49 cet and hd 21997 contain the longest - lived substantial reservoirs of circumstellar gas currently known in astronomy .",
    "moor et al ( 2011 ) outline how difficult it is to explain how so much molecular gas can be present in the circumstellar disks of such old stars . in the present paper",
    "we present a model that appears capable of accounting for the properties of such stars .",
    "we deduce the age of 49 cet based on its galactic space motions ( uvw ) and its location on an a - type star color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) . together",
    "these demonstrate that 49 cet is a member of the argus association whose age , based on analysis of its g- and k - type members ( torres et al 2008 ) , is @xmath140 myr .",
    "table 1 lists a - type stars that we propose as likely or possible members of the argus association ; some of these stars are considered in section 3 .",
    "the mean uvw of the association is given in the table notes .",
    "as may be seen , the measurement errors in radial velocity for some table 1 stars are substantial ; until more accurate velocities are measured , identification of such stars with argus can be regarded only as possible .",
    "however , the listed heliocentric radial velocity ( 10.3@xmath30.7 km s@xmath4 ) for 49 cet (= hip 7345 ) is well determined ( gontcharov 2006 ) and agrees well with the systemic velocity ( 12.2 km / s ) determined from the j = 2 - 1 line of co ( hughes et al 2008 ) . while measurement of accurate radial velocities for rapidly rotating early - type stars is challenging , precise velocities can be easily measured for radio emission lines from circumstellar disks .",
    "thus the galactic space motion of 49 cet is consistent with that of the argus association . from a list of @xmath11500",
    "early - type main sequence stars within 80 pc of earth very few are found to have all three components of uvw close to those of the argus association ( six such stars are listed in table 4 of zuckerman et al 2011 ) .    a star is included in the present tables 1 and 2 or in tables 4 - 6 of zuckerman et al ( 2011 ) if each component of uvw is consistent with that of the association mean .",
    "`` consistency '' in this context implies that all 3 stellar components of uvw match those of the association mean within the sum of the quoted error in stellar velocity and the standard deviation of the dispersion among the association velocities .",
    "however , because errors in uvw can be underestimated ( see following paragraph ) , because a standard deviation is not an absolute limit , and because these tables list `` proposed '' association members , we have tended to err somewhat on the side of including a potential non - member in preference to losing a true member .    in figure 1",
    "we plot the location on a cmd of early a - type stars near earth that have been proposed as members of five young moving groups .",
    "table 2 presents early - type stars that we propose as members of the 30 myr old tucana / horologium and columba associations ; membership is based on uvw and location on a cmd . as may be seen from figure 1 and table 3 , for a given b - v there sometimes is a substantial spread in m@xmath5 for stars proposed to be of the same or nearly the same age .",
    "if the stars have been correctly placed into the indicated moving groups , then one possibility is that some aspect of the formation and early evolution of early - type stars can lead to a range of stellar sizes at a given color and nominal age .",
    "alternatively , some of the stars in table 3 may not actually belong to the indicated moving group .",
    "given the errors in measuring radial velocities of early a - type stars and , to a lesser degree , errors in hipparcos parallaxes , some proposed members of a given moving group will ultimately turn out to be non - members . in the present work and that of our 2011 paper ( zuckerman et al 2011 ) we have adopted the gontcharov ( 2006 ) radial velocities and their errors while recognizing that the latter are likely to be too optimistic for some stars .",
    "we adopt hipparcos parallaxes from van leeuwen ( 2007 ) while anticipating that some of these may not be correct ( see , for example , the example of hip 30675 considered in section 3 ) .",
    "ultimately , high accuracy parallaxes from gaia , a dedicated campaign to confirm the gontcharov radial velocities and reduce their errors , and perhaps a traceback analysis of the moving groups , for example , as demonstrated by ortega et al ( 2002 ) for the @xmath6 pictoris moving group , should distinguish between true members and impostors .",
    "notwithstanding caveats expressed in the preceding paragraph , the excellent agreement of the uvw of 49 cet with that of the argus association and the location of 49 cet ( the red square in figure 1 and star a in table 3 ) , indicates that 49 cet is unlikely to be younger than 40 myr .",
    "indeed from comparison on figure 1 of the location of the various proposed a - type members of argus with the indicated pleiades stars ( from vigan et al 2012 ) , the argus association might be somewhat older than the 40 myr deduced by torres et al ( 2008 ) .",
    "thus , a 40 myr age for 49 cet is at least as secure as the 30 myr age for hd 21997 deduced by moor et al ( 2011 ) .",
    "hd 21997 is star `` e '' in figure 1 .",
    "various searches for co toward dusty main sequence stars with ages @xmath710 myr have been reported , but only 49 cet and hd 21997 have yielded detections ( e.g. , zuckerman et al 1995 ; dent et al 2005 ; kastner et al 2010 ; moor et al 2011 ) . in appendix a and table 4 we present a revised version of a portion of table 1 in kastner et al ( 2010 ) . a principal motivation for revisiting this table is the absence of co abundance upper limits in the kastner et al table which presents only limits to h@xmath0 abundances based on an assumed h@xmath0/co ratio by number equal to 10@xmath8 . as discussed in section 4.3 below , if the comet model described in section 4.4 can account for the co observed at 49 cet and hd 21997 , then the h@xmath0/co ratio in these debris disks is unconstrained and is unlikely to be 10@xmath8 .    in the present section we consider mid ir emission as measured with the widefield infrared survey explorer ( wise ) , uvw velocities , and location on a color - magnitude diagram of some stars listed in tables 1 - 3 along with a few additional stars of interest .",
    "we examined the wise catalog to determine if any stars in tables 1 and 2 had excess ir emission above the stellar photosphere .",
    "our criteria for deciding whether an excess is present are the same as described in section 2.2 of zuckerman et al ( 2012 ) , so we do not repeat these criteria here .",
    "four stars from tables 1 and 2 display excess emission above the stellar photosphere in the wise 22 @xmath9 m filter ; their spectral energy distributions are shown in figure 2 .",
    "hip 23585 : this table 1 star is too red to appear in figure 1 , but can be plotted on similar color - magnitude diagrams that appear in zuckerman ( 2001 ) and vigan et al ( 2012 ) .",
    "its location is consistent with a 40 myr age .",
    "hip 25280 , 59394 , 72408 , 104365 : based on their w component of space velocity , these table 2 stars are members of the tuc / hor association ( rather than columba ) .",
    "hip 26309 : this member of the nucleus of the columba association ( zuckerman et al 2011 ) , sits very low on a cmd ( star h in figure 1 ) .",
    "hip 26395 and 53771 : based on their w component of space velocity , these table 2 stars are members of the columba association ( rather than the tuc / hor association ) .",
    "hip 26395 is a new member of the nucleus of the columba association ; the nuclear region is delineated in section 5.2 of zuckerman et al ( 2011 ) .",
    "hip 26395 is star `` i '' in table 3 and figure 1 ; it , along with another columba member , hip 32104 ( star k ) , and a tuc / hor member hip 12413 ( star c ) all sit near each other and very low on the cmd .",
    "hip 30675 : this @xmath120 arcsec double star , hr 2328 , is potentially nearby and young . according to simbad and van leeuwen ( 2007 ) , the parallax is 13.26 mas which would put the star @xmath175 pc from earth .",
    "however , there are other sources where the listed parallax is much smaller , near 8 mas ; for example in the hipparcos double star catalog and in kharchenko & roeser ( 2009 ) .",
    "if 13.26 is to be believed , then the star plots too low in figure 1 to be reasonable , whereas if something like 8 is used , then the location is reasonable .",
    "also , the small proper motion is more likely for a more distant star . at a distance of 125 pc , the uvw is -10.0,-19.4,-5.7 ( 1.9,2.0,1.3 ) , consistent with membership in the columba association ( see notes to table 2 ) .",
    "the primary is a0-type and the secondary about f5 . even for a young star ,",
    "the f - star is very bright in x - rays according to figure 4 in zuckerman & song ( 2004 ) ; based on the rosat all - sky survey , its fractional x - ray luminosity ( l@xmath10/l@xmath11 ) is equal to -3.8 .",
    "hip 41081 : the u velocity component is that of tuc / hor while the w component is appropriate for columba .",
    "similar mixed - messages occur for a few stars in table 3 of zuckerman et al ( 2011 ) .",
    "hip 53771 : while too red to appear in figure 1 , the location of this table 2 star on a cmd ( zuckerman 2001 ; vigan et al 2012 ) is plausible for a 30 myr old star .",
    "hip 89925 : this double line spectroscopic binary consists of am and a9 stars ( fekel et al 2009 ) .",
    "a deconvolution of the light curve , combined with assumed b - v = 0.14 and 0.26 for the primary and secondary respectively ( fekel et al 2009 ) , places both components in the region of a cmd ( zuckerman 2001 ; vigan et al 2012 ) appropriate for 40 myr old stars .",
    "what is the origin of the molecular gas at 49 cet and hd 21997 ?",
    "some possibilities include ( 1 ) unusually long - lived remnants of the protoplanetary ( herbig ae ) phase of stellar evolution , ( 2 ) collisions of icy comets , and ( 3 ) signature of the aftermath of a recent collision of gas - rich planets or planetary embryos .",
    "the lifetime of a given co molecule in a circumstellar disk is set by the intensity of the ultraviolet stellar and interstellar radiation fields modulated by shielding by other co molecules and by h@xmath0 molecules and dust grains . in their model for hd 21997 , moor et al ( 2011 ) derive a co lifetime of @xmath1500 years and , given similarities in the two debris disks , the co lifetime at 49 cet is unlikely to be much different .",
    "500 years is so short compared with estimated ages of 30 - 40 myr that we concur with moor et al that the observed co is not likely to be a remnant of the protoplanetary phase .",
    "thus , in what follows , we consider models with rapid production of gas phase co. we assume planetesimal belts that contain volatile - rich comet - like and larger objects , akin to the sun s kuiper belt .",
    "moor et al ( 2011 ) and hughes et al ( 2008 ) find that shielding of co by dust grains is unimportant in comparison with shielding by h@xmath0 or co self - shielding . nonetheless , the dust abundance in the debris disk can potentially yield important clues regarding the origin of the co molecules .",
    "for example , 49 cet and hd 21997 are among the dustiest a - type stars within 70 pc of earth thus suggesting a direct connection between dust and gas even if the former does not protect the latter .",
    "to determine how the amount of dust at 49 cet and hd 21997 compares with that at other a - type stars near earth , we consider stars with excess 60 @xmath9 m measured with the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) and listed in table 2 of rhee et al ( 2007 ) .",
    "this table should be complete for a - stars within 70 pc of earth with large fractional infrared luminosities , @xmath12 = l@xmath13/l@xmath11 ; all such stars would have been easily detectable with iras . according to rhee et al ( 2007 ) , @xmath12 = 8 x 10@xmath14 and 5 x 10@xmath14 for 49 cet and hd 21997 , respectively .",
    "there are @xmath1300 a - type stars within @xmath170 pc of earth ( jura et al 1998 ) . of these",
    "only 4 have @xmath12 as large or larger than those of 49 cet and hd 21997 .",
    "three of the four  hr 4796 , @xmath6 pictoris , hr 7012  have ages @xmath110 myr and may not yet have completely dispersed their primordial dusty disks .",
    "in addition , the dust at these three stars is warmer than the dust at 49 cet and hd 21997 , and the closer to a star that dust grains reside the fewer are required to absorb a given fraction of the starlight .",
    "the remaining very dusty star is hip 8122 with @xmath12 = 5 x 10@xmath14 and an estimated age of 100 myr ( rhee et al 2007 ) .",
    "thus , for stars whose infrared emission is dominated by kuiper belt analog , cool dust , 49 cet and hd 21997 rank among the 1 - 2% dustiest of nearby a - type stars .",
    "( we do not consider here the tiny number of young nearby a - type stars with ir - excess emission dominated by warm , zodiacal - type dust ( melis et al 2012 ) ) .",
    "youth and dustiness notwithstanding , co has not yet been detected with a radio telescope at any of hr 4796 , @xmath6 pictoris , or hr 7012 , consistent with the notion that the co gas seen at 49 cet and hd 21997 is not primordial .",
    "if the co gas were primordial , then on average one would expect more co in a dusty 10 myr old circumstellar envelope than one of age 30 - 40 myr . while there have been detections via optical absorption lines of trace amounts of gas around some main sequence stars including @xmath6 pictoris ( e.g. , roberge & weinberger 2008 and references therein ) , the derived column densities of gas are far less than those necessary for radio detection of a rotational line in emission .",
    "the far infrared emission seen by iras is carried primarily by grains of radius @xmath110 @xmath9 m , just above the radiative blowout size .",
    "flux densities at submillimeter wavelengths sample larger grains , with radii up to a few mm .",
    "the total mass of these large grains has been measured with radio telescopes at various stars ; results are listed in table 2 in rhee et al ( 2007 ) and  for vega , fomalhaut , 49 cet , and hd 21997  are presented in the 4th column of table 5 of the present paper . again , whether one examines table 2 in rhee et al ( 2007 ) or table 5 here , 49 cet and hd 21997 stand out for having large total dust masses in comparison with other nearby stars .",
    "if co molecules are sequestered in planetesimals and in the dusty - icy matrices that result from collisions of such objects , then dust and co production rates should be related . as many authors have shown , for debris disks as dusty as those at 49 cet and hd 21997 , collisional cascade followed by radiative blowout of small dust grains is a far faster dust loss mechanism than is poynting - robertson drag .",
    "given the plausibility of a direct or indirect connection between dust and co production rates ( as considered above ) , it is important to understand both rates .",
    "unfortunately , in two of the best studied debris disks , estimates of dust production rates are wildly discrepant  for vega ( su et al 2005 ; mller et al 2010 ) and for fomalhaut ( acke et al 2012 ; krivov 2012 , personal communication and below ) .",
    "we therefore consider collisional cascade rates in some detail .",
    "0.2 in      one may estimate a minimum dust mass required to block a given fraction of the light of a star ( e.g. , chen & jura 2001 ) ; we denote this fraction as @xmath12 = l@xmath13/l@xmath11 ( see the third column in table 5 ) . for conventional dust grain size distributions , such as in a collisional cascade , the dominant particles contributing to @xmath12 have radii somewhat larger than the blowout radius ( chen & jura 2001 )",
    ". the required dust production rate in a steady - state must balance the most rapid relevant loss rate of these dominant particles ; in a collisional cascade this loss rate is set by destructive collisions of small particles that give rise to even smaller particles that can then be radiatively blown out of the debris disk .",
    "@xmath12 is an easily observable quantity and is equivalent to radial optical depth through a spherically symmetric dust shell .    in appendix",
    "b we derive an expression , as a function of @xmath12 , for collision times of dust particles with sizes slightly above the blowout size .",
    "we consider a cylindrical ring of radius r , width in the radial direction of @xmath15r , and full vertical height h. then the collision time is    0.2 in    @xmath16    0.2 in    where p is orbital period .",
    "the dust loss rates at vega and at fomalhaut estimated by su et al ( 2005 ) and acke et al ( 2012 ) , respectively , are much larger than one calculates from equa.1 or in the collisional cascade model proposed by mller et al ( 2010 ) .",
    "we consider these discrepancies in detail in appendix c. for reasons given there , and because the su et al and acke et al papers lack a description of a physical mechanism that can generate small dust particles at the rates required in their models , we assume a conventional collisional cascade to produce small particles at a rate given by equa.1 . with this expression and the one that follows",
    ", we can calculate the rate of dust grain production / loss for 49 cet and hd 21997 .",
    "as shown in detail by melis et al ( 2012 ) , the mass loss rate in a collisional cascade can be written as a function of stellar and dust properties ,    0.2 in    @xmath17    0.2 in    where r@xmath18 , t@xmath18 , and m@xmath18 are in solar units and t@xmath19 is in k. the value of the coefficient c depends on the ratio @xmath15r / r in equa.1 .",
    "for @xmath15r / r = 0.5 , appropriate for 49 cet and for hd 21997 ( table 5 ) , c = 1.75 x 10@xmath20 when dm / dt is in g s@xmath4 .",
    "we take r@xmath18 , t@xmath18 , @xmath12 , and t@xmath19 from table 2 in rhee et al ( 2007 ) , and assume m@xmath18 = 2.7 and 2.4 for 49 cet and hd 21997 , respectively .",
    "the derived loss rate , in g s@xmath4 , for small dust particles is listed in table 5 for these two stars as well as for vega and fomalhaut .",
    "the table 5 dust loss rates for 49 cet and hd 21997 are similar to dust production rates derived by kenyon & bromley ( 2010 ) in their model for debris disks around 30 myr old a - type stars ( e.g. , see their figs .",
    "13 & 14 ) .",
    "0.2 in      in a steady - state model for the co currently in orbit around hd 21997 , moor et al ( 2011 ) deduce that 140 earth masses of planetesimals in the debris disk would have to have been destroyed in the past 20 myr .",
    "this contrasts dramatically with the mller et al ( 2010 ) model for vega where a collisional cascade operating for the past @xmath1340 myr would have destroyed only a few earth masses of solids .",
    "moor et al thus favor a situation where the co is currently experiencing a temporary high production rate .",
    "the mass loss rate in dust at hd 21997 ( table 5 ) presents another potential problem for any steady state model for generating the observed co. moor et al derive a minimum co production rate of 10@xmath21 g s@xmath4 .",
    "this is an order of magnitude faster than the dust production rate ( table 5 ) .",
    "suppose the dust is composed of a 50 - 50 mixture by mass of water ice versus silicates plus other solids ( e.g. , section 3.2 in acke et al 2012 ) .",
    "optimistically taking the co and co@xmath0 mass fractions in a typical comet to each be 20% that of water ice ( mumma & charnley 2011 ) , and assuming that photodissociation of co@xmath0 produces a co molecule , one then obtains a ratio , co / dust , equal to @xmath10.2 by mass . then the co production rate would seem to be of order a factor of 50 too fast relative to that of the dust , at least in the steady - state .",
    "these assumed co and co@xmath0 mass fractions are near the upper end of those measured in solar system comets ( mumma & charnley 2011 ) .",
    "however , solar system observations sample only the outer layers of comets that are much older and have been heated to much higher temperatures than young comets at 49 cet and hd 21997 .",
    "thus , it would not be surprising if the latter are , on average , more co- and co@xmath0-rich than solar system comets .",
    "the discrepancy between the co and dust production rates in the steady state could be reduced somewhat should co and co@xmath0 carry an even larger fraction of the mass of a typical youthful comet than we have assumed .      in section 4.4",
    "we present a colliding comet model to account for the co observed at 49 cet and hd 21997 .",
    "should outgassing from comets be responsible for the co , then the h@xmath0/co ratio in the debris disks is essentially unconstrained . in particular , there is no reason to expect the large ratios by number , e.g. 10@xmath8 or 10@xmath22 , conventionally assumed in models of co excitation ( e.g , hughes et al 2008 ; moor et al 2011 ) .",
    "then excitation of co rotational levels may well be due to something other than collisions with h@xmath0 .",
    "one plausible alternative could be collisions of co with electrons .",
    "following photodissociation of co , the c will be photoionized and a source of electrons .",
    "provided the c+ ions remain in the same volume as the co molecules for a sufficient length of time , then these electrons can excite the co rotational ladder .",
    "dickinson et al ( 1977 ) give expressions for calculation of rate coefficients for electron excitation of rotational levels of linear polar molecules in low density clouds .",
    "we assume an electron temperature of 70 k and consider the j = 2 - 1 transition of co. then the collision time ( sec ) for excitation of the j = 2 level is 1.4 x 10@xmath23/n@xmath24 , where n@xmath24 is the number of electrons per @xmath25 . for the co 2 - 1 transition 1/a @xmath110@xmath26 sec",
    "so , the j = 2 level can be significantly excited in regions with n@xmath24 @xmath1100 @xmath25 .",
    "the electron densities are related to the co volume densities and the lifetime of c+ and electrons in the volume where the co resides . given the substantial uncertainties in the volumes occupied by the observed co molecules at 49 cet and hd 21997 , reliable estimation of electron densities will have to await mapping of co with alma .",
    "that said , with co volumes based on values for @xmath15r , r and h listed in table 5 , provided that co and c+ abundances are comparable in regions where co resides , then electrons would be a viable collision partner for excitation of co in orbit around 49 cet and hd 21997 .",
    "independent of whether or not electrons dominate excitation of co rotational levels , because h@xmath0 helps to shield co against photodissociation , if h@xmath0 abundances are much lower than assumed in conventional models , then this could have substantial implications for the co production rates required to match the observations .",
    "two principal constraints on a model that seeks to explain the co abundances at 49 cet and hd 21997 are ( 1 ) the rapid rate of co production necessitated by its short ( @xmath1 500 yr ) lifetime against photodissociation ( e.g. , moor et al 2011 ) , and ( 2 ) the relatively rapid rate of co production compared to dust production ( section 4.2 ) .",
    "the model outlined below involves collisions among the great numbers of comets that likely orbit 49 cet and hd 21997 . because these two stars rank among the dustiest a - type stars in the solar vicinity ( section 4 and table 5 ) it is not unreasonable to assume that their debris disks are quite massive relative to those that orbit most other stars . in this sense 49 cet and hd 21997 are very dusty stars ; but in comparison to the amount of co present , there is relatively little dust .",
    "schlichting & sari ( 2011 ) present a model of the young sun s kuiper belt ( kb ) .",
    "they argue that the total kb mass was dominated during its first 70 myr by comet - size planetesimals and that the kb never possessed many more pluto - size objects than it does now .",
    "they take the radius r , radial width @xmath15r , and total mass of the kb to be 40 au , 10 au , and 40 earth masses , respectively .",
    "we envision the debris regions at 49 cet and hd 21997 to have r = 100 au and ( @xmath15r)/r = 0.5 ( table 5 ) .",
    "neither r nor @xmath15r are particularly well constrained by existing data for these stars ; hopefully alma will substantially improve the situation in the future . for the sun s young kuiper belt region and for 49 cet and hd 21997",

    "while this is a lot of co , it is only a tiny fraction of the total mass of comets in the debris disk .",
    "as noted in section 4.2 , the co production rate by mass at hd 21997 is a factor of 10 faster than the dust production rate given in table 5 via a collisional cascade . if we assume that the co lifetime against photodissociation at 49 cet is the same as that at hd 21997 ( 500 years ) , then for 49 cet the ratio of co to dust production rate is @xmath120 .    in our model the fraction of mass released via comet collisions in the form of co and co@xmath0 is only @xmath120% of the mass released in solid material that will eventually , via a collisional cascade ,",
    "become the 10 @xmath9 m size dust grains considered in appendix c. the key to why the co - to - dust production rates are skewed so heavily in favor of co is probably related to the much shorter time it takes to release large amounts of co following a disruptive impact compared to the time to whittle a large chunk of solid debris down to 10 @xmath9m - size particles . with equa.1 , the collision time at hd 21997 for dust particles with sizes a bit above",
    "the blowout radius is 2.6 x 10@xmath8 yr . for typical solid chunks coming off a comet collision , the ensuing collision times could easily be millions of years .    in the model of schlichting & sari ( 2011 ) , dynamical stirring of the young kb increases as a function of time  as large bodies grow in the debris belt , they stir up the smaller objects ( the comet - size objects we are considering here ) .",
    "a similar picture of the early evolution of debris disks around youthful a - type stars was developed earlier by kenyon & bromley ( 2008 , 2010 ) .",
    "thus , 49 cet and hd 21997 may be in a dynamically active phase where comet collisions are frequent , but where the breakdown of large bodies of solid debris into small dust particles has not yet had time to operate to conclusion .",
    "the spirit of such a model is not one that relies on an unusual , catastrophic , transient event .",
    "rather the two stars are passing through a normal era in the evolution of comet - dominated debris belts .",
    "given the discussions in schlichting & sari ( 2011 ) and kenyon & bromley ( 2010 ) , it would not be unreasonable for that era to occur at an age of @xmath130 myr ( see , e.g. , , the 1 km panel in figure 23 in kenyon & bromley 2010 ) .",
    "we present a massive ( 400 earth mass ) comet - cloud model to explain the large quantities of carbon monoxide gas seen at the 30 - 40 myr old , a - type , stars hd 21997 and 49 ceti .",
    "because co is rapidly photodissociated in the stellar and interstellar radiation fields , it must be produced rapidly .",
    "we calculate that this production rate is an order of magnitude faster than the rate of production of dust particles via a model of collisional cascade in the steady state .",
    "the implications of this ratio are : ( 1 ) young , pristine comets are likely to be richer in co and perhaps co@xmath0 than typically observed solar system comets , and ( 2 ) the destruction of the youthful comets around hd 21997 and 49 cet are not likely to have been in a steady state situation over periods of time exceeding millions of years . if dynamical activity in debris disks is ramping up at the age of these stars , for example through the build - up of large bodies as in the model of the young kuiper belt proposed by schlichting & sari ( 2011 ) or the model of debris disks around a - type stars by kenyon & bromley ( 2010 ) , then the production of small dust particles may lag well behind the rate of co outgassing .",
    "the primary driving force for co outgassing is likely to be collisions among the 100 trillion comets that orbit 49 cet and hd 21997 .",
    "such a model for these systems is consistent with origin in a protoplanetary disk of initial mass of order a few tenths of a solar mass and suggests that comets form very early in the history of such disks before there is sufficient time to convert much co to ch@xmath37 .",
    "if comet collisions provide the observed co , then the h@xmath0/co ratio is unconstrained and may not be large .",
    "if so , then collisional excitation of the co rotational levels may be dominated by something other than h@xmath0 , perhaps electrons .",
    "acke et al ( 2012 ) have proposed a rapid comet - destruction model for the dusty debris disk that orbits fomalhaut that , at first glance , might seem similar to our model for hd 21997 and 49 ceti .",
    "but , in fact , the two models are very different .",
    "as we note in appendix c , the acke et al dust loss rate is 20 times faster than the rate we calculate via a conventional collisional cascade .",
    "they do not specify a physical mechanism that can convert comets so rapidly into dust .",
    "their rapid dust loss rate at fomalhaut is compelled by their quoted very short lifetime ( 1700 yr ) for dust grains near the blowout size . but a detailed model of the similar debris disk at vega by mller et al ( 2010 and as outlined in our appendix c ) casts doubt on the validity of such a short lifetime .",
    "additional observations and modeling of the fomalhaut debris disk are warranted .",
    "in particular , a deep search for co at fomalhaut would be worthwhile ; because it is the presence of so much co that compels the rapid comet destruction rate in our model , while combination of observations of co and of dust serve to constrain the model .    at the risk of being obvious",

    "should a model similar to that of mller et al ( 2010 ) apply to fomalhaut as well as to vega , then a normal collisional cascade might account for the dust distribution at fomalhaut and invocation of an extreme colliding - comet model might be unnecessary .",
