    "there are many contexts in which random motion is confined to the surface of a sphere .",
    "examples include the motion of a unit vector @xmath1 indicating the orientation of an object tumbling in a turbulent fluid flow , or the advection of a tracer in a thin , turbulent planetary atmosphere . in some applications",
    "it is sufficient to model the motion as diffusion on the surface of a sphere , which can be solved by noting that the eigenfunctions of the diffusion operator are spherical harmonics . in other applications ,",
    "however , the angular velocity varies smoothly as a function of time , and the diffusive approximation is not valid .",
    "our objective is to obtain insight into random motion of a unit vector , by studying what is perhaps the simplest model .",
    "smooth random motion on a sphere can be characterised by a dimensionless parameter which measures the typical angular distance through which the point has turned in the timescale for relaxation of fluctuations of the angular velocity . due to an analogy with the concept of persistence length in polymer physics @xcite , we term this parameter the _ persistence angle _",
    ": it will be denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "it is desirable to have a model which is a physically well motivated description of some processes , in which @xmath2 appears as a parameter .",
    "this paper discusses such a model , which is an extension of the well - known ornstein - uhlenbeck process @xcite to describe motion on a circle or a sphere .",
    "we start by describing the standard ornstein - uhlenbeck equation on a line , in order to introduce some notation and elementary ideas .",
    "the ornstein - uhlenbeck process is a stochastic differential equation for the time - dependence of a variable @xmath3 : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a white - noise signal , satisfying @xmath6 throughout this paper , @xmath7 is the expectation value of @xmath8 .",
    "the process equilibrates to a statistically stationary state , characterised by the following correlation function : @xmath9 equation ( [ eq : 1.1 ] ) may be considered purely as a model for the fluctuations of velocity @xmath10 of a particle , or it may be combined with the equation @xmath11 to give a model for the displacement @xmath12 .",
    "the motion in space is ballistic when viewed on short timescales , but on long timescales it is diffusive , with the displacement @xmath13 satisfying @xmath14 and @xmath15 , with spatial diffusion constant @xmath16 : @xmath17 to generalize the ornstein - uhlenbeck model on a line to a circle , we simply replace the variable @xmath10 by the angular velocity , @xmath18 , and the displacement along the line , @xmath12 , by the angle along the circle , @xmath19 . in two dimensions",
    ", we are considering the ornstein - uhlenbeck process on a manifold which has the simplest closed topology , namely a circle .",
    "if the equation of motion ( [ eq : 1.1 ] ) is interpreted as a description of an angular velocity @xmath18 , then @xmath20 has dimension @xmath21={\\rm t}^{-3}$ ] .",
    "the damping rate has dimension @xmath22={\\rm t}^{-1}$ ] .",
    "thus , the problem is completely characterized by one single dimensionless parameter constructed from @xmath20 and @xmath23 ; we take this to be @xmath24 the parameter @xmath2 has the following simple physical interpretation .",
    "the typical angular velocity is , according to ( [ eq : 1.3 ] ) , @xmath25 , and its fluctuations occur on a timescale @xmath26 .",
    "the typical angle of rotation over the correlation timescale of the angular velocity is then @xmath27 , so that @xmath2 does correspond to a persistence angle .    in this paper",
    "we show how to compute statistics characterising both circular and spherical ornstain - uhlenbeck processes , such as the correlation function @xmath28 the solution to this problem has very different properties in two and three dimensions .    in two dimensions ,",
    "exact formulae are obtained for @xmath29 by expressing this correlation function in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the fokker - planck equation describing the probability density of the angular velocity and angle variables .",
    "we find that the correlation function @xmath29 can be expressed as a series : @xmath30 where the coefficients @xmath31 are determined explicitly , and satisfy @xmath32 .",
    "we show that series given by eq.[eq : 1.7 ] can be summed exactly , which reduces the correlation function to a very simple analytic form .",
    "there is , however , a surprising feature of this series expansion which deserves comment .",
    "although the series ( [ eq : 1.7 ] ) is convergent for all @xmath33 and for all @xmath2 , in the limit as @xmath34 the structure of ( [ eq : 1.7 ] ) appears to be hard to reconcile with physical expectations .",
    "we expect that when @xmath35 , the object rotates with almost constant angular velocity , and the decay of correlations results from motions with different angular velocity getting out of phase .",
    "this occurs on a timescale @xmath36 , _ larger _ than the timescale for decay of the leading factor in ( [ eq : 1.7 ] ) , which is @xmath37 .",
    "the implication is that , when @xmath35 , the summation over the exponentially _ decreasing _ terms approaches an _ increasing _ exponential , which almost cancels the rapid decay of @xmath38 .",
    "we show how this behaviour is realised , by taking very large coefficients with alternating signs .",
    "this effect is analogous to a phenomenon known as superoscillation @xcite , where a fourier sum oscillates faster than appears to be possible due to its bandwidth . in the case where @xmath39 , the motion of @xmath1 is well approximated by diffusion on the circle , and in that limit ( [ eq : 1.7 ] ) yields @xmath40 , as expected .",
    "the extension of the problem to three - dimensions requires the introduction of a _ vector _ to describe the angular velocity .",
    "in addition , the closed manifold that describes the configuration of the system has a significantly more complicated topology .",
    "it turns out that in three - dimensions , the ornstein - uhlenbeck model of dynamic on a sphere does not appear to allow an exact solution , and we show that the spectrum has a very different structure from that of the two - dimensional case . when @xmath41 , the dynamics is easily understood in terms of diffusion on the surface of a sphere , for which the eigenfunctions are spherical harmonics .",
    "the solution has a much more complex behaviour in the limit as @xmath34 . as for the two - dimensional case ,",
    "there is a transient which occurs on a timescale @xmath42 , but this transient is followed by a slow exponential decay of the correlation function on a timescale @xmath43 .",
    "we show that in the limit as @xmath34 the slowest - decaying mode contributing to the correlation function is obtained from a radial schrdinger equation for which the quantum number @xmath44 takes an _ irrational _ value .",
    "physically , the two time - scale solution we find for the correlation function can be explained by noting that when the angular velocity is constant , the component of @xmath45 parallel to @xmath18 is also a constant .",
    "the existence of this invariance explains the slow decorrelation of @xmath45 at long times .    because this problem is far from straightforward we start by considering the two - dimensional case , where the ornstein - uhlenbeck process has a circular coordinate . in section",

    "examples include the rotational motion of rocks or dust grains in turbulent circumstellar discs @xcite , or of ice crystals in a convecting atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the rotational motion of such bodies can influence their growth by aggregation or their evaporation by exposure to a source of radiant heat .",

    "the model could also be used for the fluctuations of direction vector @xmath1 of a rod - like body in a turbulent fluid .",

    ", we argue below that the statistical properties of the velocity gradients of turbulence appear to make this a very good model .",
    "the orientation of a small body in a turbulent flow with velocity field @xmath123 responds to the gradients of the the velocity field , evaluated along the trajectory @xmath124 of the body ( which can be assumed to be advected with the fluid ) .",

    "it is convenient to write @xmath127 , where @xmath128 , the vorticity tensor , is antisymmetric and where @xmath129 , the strain - rate , is symmetric .",

    "the same equation of motion applies to general axisymmetric bodies , provided they are small compared to any characteristic lengthscale of the flow @xcite , but the relation between @xmath79 and the shape of the object is not known in general . in the case of a spherical particle or other object with @xmath131 , the equation of motion ( [ eq : 5.1 ] ) is of the same form as equation ( [ eq : 3.1.1 ] ) , if we interpret the vorticity @xmath132 as being the antisymmetric tensor corresponding to the axial vector @xmath133 , with elements related by @xmath134 .",
    "furthermore , the lagrangian correlation function of the vorticity in turbulent flows has been investigated using simulations of turbulent flows by several authors @xcite .",
    "the elements have mean value equal to zero and appear to be statistically independent .",
    "it was found that the correlation function of each elements can be fitted quite accurately by an exponential function : @xmath135 the decay rate @xmath136 is of the order of the inverse of the kolmogorov timescale @xmath137 of the turbulent flow , which is the shortest timescale of the fluid motion : @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is the kinematic viscosity and where @xmath140 is the rate of dissipation per unit mass .",

    "these considerations suggest that the spherical ornstein - uhlenbeck model should describe tumbling of a small object in a turbulent flow , with a universal value for the persistence angle @xmath144 however , we can not conclude that correlation function @xmath145 for objects in a turbulent fluid will correspond to that of our spherical ornstein - uhlenbeck model , because vorticity may have very different temporal variation , compared to the ornstein - uhlenbeck model , but still have the same correlation function .",
    "this point is illustrated by a calculation in appendix b , where we analyse a model for random motion on a circle , in which the angular velocity is determined by a telegraph process ( examples of this type of model are considered in @xcite ) .",
    "the telegraph model has a correlation function of angular velocity which is an exponential function , equivalent to that of the circular ornstein - uhlenbeck process .",
    "however we show that the correlation function @xmath146 is very different for the two models .",
    "we conclude that the extent to which the spherical ornstein - uhlenbeck process is a good description of tumbling in a turbulent fluid must be tested by numerical simulations of turbulence .",
    "our own numerical investigations on the tumbling of microscoipic particles in turbulence indicate that the spherical ornstein - uhlenbeck model is not a good model for their correlation function @xcite .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with studies by shin and koch @xcite , who presented data for @xmath147 in simulations of rod - like objects in fully developed driven turbulent flows .",
    "it is only in cases where the statistics of the angular momentum fluctuations are a precise match to the spherical ornstein - uhlenbeck process that reliable predictions can be made about the correlation function defined by ( [ eq : 1.6 ] ) . in the case of an object tumbling in a very dilute gas , such as a small rock in the circumstellar disc of the star , the spherical ornstein - uhlenbeck model may be a very good description of the evolution of the angular momemtum .",
    "bombardment by microscopic dust grains can provide random impulses which change the angular momentum in the same way as the white - noise fluctuations in ( [ eq : 3.1.2 ] ) . and the damping due to motion in an extremely dilute gas is proportional to the relative velocity @xcite , consistent with the linear damping term in equation ( [ eq : 3.1.2 ] ) .",
    "we conclude that a small body tumbling in a very dilute gas is one example where the spherical ornstein uhlenbeck model is an excellent description of a physical process .",
    "our study was motivated by recent works , which have characterized the orientation of particles transported by a turbulent flow @xcite .",
    "these processes are naturally described by the random motion on a spherical surface .",
    "the work here has focused on arguably the simplest model for smooth random motion on a sphere : the direction @xmath148 rotates with an angular velocity @xmath133 , which evolves according to an ornstein - uhlenbeck process .",
    "the solution of this model depends on only one dimensionless parameter , which we refer to here as @xmath2 , the persistence angle , which characterizes the rotation occuring during one correlation time of @xmath133 .",
    "we have characterised evolution of @xmath1 by analysing its correlation function @xmath149 .    in two dimensions ,",
    "we have obtained an explicit expression for the correlation function , in terms of very elementary functions .",
    "this was achieved by completely diagonalizing the fokker - planck operator and hence writing the correlation function as a series , whose sum can be explicitly determined .",
    "in contrast , the motion on the three - dimensional sphere is more involved .",
    "this is largely due to the more complicated structure of the rotation group in three dimensions . quite generally",
    ", the components of @xmath150 perpendicular to @xmath133 rapidly rotate , hence decorrelate , whereas the component parallel to @xmath133 remains unchanged , at least when @xmath133 is constant . in the limit when the persistance angle is large , this leads to a two time - scale dynamics : a fast decorrelation of @xmath150 is observed , corresponding to the components of @xmath150 perpendicular to @xmath133 , followed by a much slower decorrelation of @xmath150 , corresponding to the component parallel to @xmath133 . whereas the fast decorrelation can be understood quantitatively by using elementary considerations , the description of the decorrelation of @xmath150 at large times requires a determination of the largest eigenvalue of the fokker - planck operator .",
    "we have computed here the eigenvalues relevant to the long term evolution of @xmath151 .",
    "interestingly , in the large @xmath152 limit , the problem reduces to a quantum harmonic oscillator with a irrational angular momentum .",
    "the ornstein - uhlenbeck model is closely related to the equation describing the orientational degrees of freedom of small particles in turbulent flows @xcite , and numerical studies show that the vorticity of turbulent flows also has an exponential correlation @xcite . however , we have observed here that caution should observed in applying our model to rotation by turbulence . in two dimensions we showed that the correlation function of @xmath45 takes a very different form when the angular velocity is generated by a telegraph process , despite the fact that the correlation function of @xmath18 are identical to our model .    in summary , the notion of the persistence angle introduced here appears to be the most relevant parameter characterising random rotation .",
    "the ornstein - uhlenbeck model is the simplest description of random motion on a sphere , and it will surely find signoficant applications , beyond the example considered at the end of section [ sec : 5 ] .",

    "<S> the paper considers random motion of a point on the surface of a sphere , in the case where the angular velocity is determined by an ornstein - uhlenbeck process . </S>",
    "<S> the solution is fully characterized by only one dimensionless number , the persistence angle , which is the typical angle of rotation of the object during the correlation time of the angular velocity .    </S>",
    "<S> we first show that the two - dimensional case is exactly solvable . </S>",
    "<S> when the persistence angle is large , a series for the correlation function has the surprising property that its sum varies much more slowly than any of its individual terms .    in three dimensions we obtain asymptotic forms for the correlation function , in the limits where the persistence angle is very small and very large . </S>",
    "<S> the latter case exhibits a complicated transient , followed by a much slower exponential decay . </S>",
    "<S> the decay rate is determined by the solution of a radial schr \" odinger equation in which the angular momentum quantum number takes an irrational value , namely @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> possible applications of the model to objects tumbling in a turbulent environment are discussed . </S>"
