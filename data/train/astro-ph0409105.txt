    "it has been well established that dense cores in dark clouds are formation sites of low - mass stars .",
    "because dense cores have low kinetic temperature ( 10 k ) and high h@xmath3 density ( @xmath7 @xmath8 ) , they have been observed mainly with molecular lines in radio wavelength . among a number of observational studies , the most systematic and extensive survey observations of nh@xmath0 by myers and his collaborators",
    "have greatly contributed to understanding of the physical property of dark cloud cores ( e.g. benson & myers 1989 ) .",
    "they found that 68 % of the dense cores observed by the nh@xmath0 lines accompany the _ iras _ sources , which are newly born stars in the cores ( benson & myers 1989 ; beichman et al .",
    "therefore , it has been recognized that the nh@xmath0 lines are useful to study the physical properties of star forming dense cores in dark clouds .    on the other hand , suzuki et al .",
    "( 1992 ) pointed out that nh@xmath0 is not always a good tracer of dense cores because of the chemical abundance variation from core to core .",
    "they carried out survey observations of ccs , hc@xmath0n , hc@xmath2n , and nh@xmath0 toward 49 dense cores and found that the spectra of carbon - chain molecules tend to be intense in starless cores , while those of nh@xmath0 tend to be intense in star forming cores .",
    "especially , suzuki et al . (",
    "1992 ) identified a few cores called `` carbon - chain - producing regions '' , where the lines of carbon - chain molecules are intense while the nh@xmath0 lines are hardly detected .",
    "they are l1495b , l1521b , l1521e , and the cyanopolyyne peak of tmc-1 .",
    "recently , hirota , ikeda , & yamamoto ( 2001 , 2003 ) reported that deuterium fractionation ratios of dnc / hnc and dco@xmath4/hco@xmath4 are significantly lower in carbon - chain - producing regions than in the others .",
    "these systematic abundance variations would reflect the difference in chemical evolutionary stages of the cores ; carbon - chain molecules and nh@xmath0 are abundant in relatively early and late stages , respectively ( suzuki et al .",
    "1992 ) and deuterium fractionation ratios increase as the core evolves ( hirota et al .",
    "2001 ; saito et al .",
    "2000 ; saito et al .",
    "2002 ) .    although detailed studies on carbon - chain - producing regions , which can not be traced by the nh@xmath0 lines , are essential for understanding of chemical and physical evolution of dense cores ( suzuki et al .",
    "1992 ) , no systematic study has been carried out for a long time , except for tmc-1 ( e.g. olano , walmsley , & wilson 1988 ; hirahara et al .",
    "1992 ; pratap et al .",
    "1997 ) . in order to investigate the basic physical and chemical properties , we carried out detailed observations of a representative carbon - chain - producing region , l1521e , with various molecular lines ( hirota , ito , & yamamoto 2002 ) .",
    "the important results obtained there are as follows ; ( 1 ) there exists a compact dense core traced by the h@xmath5co@xmath4 , hn@xmath5c , ccs , and hc@xmath0n lines , and their distributions have a single peak at the same position ; ( 2 ) the distribution of ccs in l1521e is different from those in well - studied starless cores , l1498 and l1544 , where the distribution of ccs shows a shell - like structure ; ( 3 ) although the h@xmath3 density is as high as ( 1.3 - 5.6)@xmath910@xmath10 @xmath8 at the center of l1521e , the inversion lines of nh@xmath0 are found to be very faint in l1521e , indicating the low nh@xmath0 abundance ; ( 4 ) abundances of carbon - chain molecules in l1521e are systematically higher than those in the other dark cloud cores , and especially the abundances of sulfur - bearing carbon - chain molecules c@xmath11s are comparable to those in cyanopolyyne peak of tmc-1 . according to these results along with a fact that there exist neither _ iras _",
    "point sources , evidence of molecular outflow , nor signature of infall motion , we suggested that l1521e would be in a very early stage of physical and chemical evolution ( hirota et al .",
    "2002 ) . very recently , detailed chemical model calculations ( aikawa , ohashi , & herbst 2003 ) and molecular line and millimeter continuum observations ( tafalla & santiago 2004 ) also confirmed our results .    the carbon - chain - producing regions would be chemically and dynamically less evolved than other dark cloud cores , and are rare objects .",
    "in fact , only 4 such sources have been recognized ( suzuki et al .",
    "therefore , it is important to carry out detailed studies on the other carbon - chain - producing regions in order to understand general properties of dense cores in a very early stage of chemical and dynamical evolution . although l1521b has been observed and detected in previous molecular line surveys ( nh@xmath0 for benson & myers 1989 ; hc@xmath2n for benson & myers 1983 ; ccs for ohashi 2000 ; h@xmath5co@xmath4 onishi et al .",

    "this position lies close to the northwest peak position of the h@xmath5co@xmath4 core mc 22 observed by onishi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . the simple elliptical distribution of ccs in l1521b is also reported by ohashi ( 2000 ) , in which they observed the @xmath18 line of ccs in the 33 ghz band with the bima array .    the single peak distribution of ccs observed in l1495b and l1521b , as well as l1521e ( hirota et al .",

    "1999 ; benson & myers 1989 ) , and several other cores ( ohashi 2000 ; lai & crutcher 2000 ) , the distribution of ccs shows a shell - like structure , while that of nh@xmath0 is concentrated at the central position ( e.g. tafalla et al . 2002 ) .",
    "such distributions can be interpreted qualitatively in terms of the chemical evolution ; ccs tends to be deficient at the center of chemically evolved cores , whereas nh@xmath0 becomes abundant there ( suzuki et al .",

    "in contrast to l1498 and l1544 , ccs is not deficient at the center of the core in l1495b , l1521b , and l1521e .    assuming that the distance to the taurus molecular cloud is 140 pc ( elias 1978 ) , the core radius is derived to be 0.063 pc and 0.044 pc for l1495b and l1521b , respectively , from two dimensional gaussian fitting of the integrated intensity map of ccs .",
    "the core radius of l1521b is comparable to that derived from the h@xmath5co@xmath4 map , 0.054 pc ( onishi et al .",

    "we assume that the cores are homogeneous spheres with constant density . because the density profile is not uniform in starless cores , ( e.g. ward - thompson et al .",
    "1999 ; evans et al . 2001 ; tafalla et al .",
    "2002 , 2004 ) , the mass presented here would be overestimated . the peak h@xmath3 density in l1521b is derived to be 1.9@xmath910@xmath10 @xmath8 and ( 6 - 7)@xmath910@xmath25 @xmath8 from multi - transition observations of c@xmath6s ( hirota et al . 1998 ) and ccs ( suzuki et al .",

    "the total linewidths derived from the ccs lines are 0.48 km s@xmath30 and 0.54 km s@xmath30 for l1495b and l1521b , respectively , and hence , the virial masses are estimated to be 3.0@xmath26 and 2.7@xmath26 , respectively . if we adopt the linewidths derived from the h@xmath5co@xmath4 lines , the total linewidths are 0.62 km s@xmath30 and 0.69 km s@xmath30 for l1495b and l1521b , respectively , and the virial masses are estimated to be 5.0@xmath26 and 4.4@xmath26 , respectively .",
    "although both the total mass and the virial mass contain large uncertainty of typically a factor of 3 , l1495b and l1521b are not likely to be unstable against collapse , but rather in virial equilibrium .",
    "it is consistent with the fact that evidences of infalling motions ( lee , myers , & tafalla 1999 ) have never been reported for l1521b , suggesting at least l1521b is not in a dynamically collapsing phase .",

    "these facts suggest that the l1495b and l1521b cores are in the early stage of dynamical evolution .",
    "however , the detailed physical properties of l1495b and l1521b should be further investigated with other well - studied high density tracers such as the c@xmath35o and h@xmath5co@xmath4 lines ( myers et al .",

    "on the other hand , linewidths of the h@xmath5co@xmath4 lines in l1495b and l1521b are comparable to those found in more evolved starless cores such as l1521f ( onishi et al .",

    "although the abundances of n@xmath3h@xmath4 are derived only with 3@xmath39 upper limit , they seem to be systematically lower in all 3 carbon - chain - producing regions than in tmc-1 . therefore , chemical compositions of l1495b and l1521b are quite similar to that of l1521e ( hirota et al . 2002 ) .    according to a simple gas - phase pseudo - time dependent chemical model ( e.g. suzuki et al .",
    "1992 ) , ccs and carbon - chain molecules are abundant only in the early evolutionary stage of dark cloud cores .",
    "this is because ccs and carbon - chain molecules are efficiently produced when the c@xmath4 ions and the c atoms are abundant while they are deficient when the c atoms are locked into co. in addition , the ccs molecules freeze - out onto grains as the core density increases because sulfur - bearing species are tightly bound in grain mantles ( bergin & langer 1997 ) .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that l1495b , l1521b , and l1521e are in almost the same chemical evolutionary stage , and would be in the earliest phase of chemical evolution . on the other hand , ruffle et al .",
    "( 1997 ) presented completely different chemical model calculations suggesting that abundances of cyanopolyynes may increase at the late time where molecules freeze - out onto dust grains .",
    "however , it is well known both theoretically and observationally that the freeze - out of co boosts the production rate of nh@xmath0 and n@xmath3h@xmath4 ( bergin & langer 1997 ; aikawa et al . 2003 ; tafalla et al .",
    "2002 , 2004 ) .",
    "this is not consistent with our observational result that the abundances of nh@xmath0 and n@xmath3h@xmath4 in these three cores are lower than in other dark cloud cores .",
    "in addition , the freeze - out of co makes the lifetime of h@xmath3d@xmath4 longer , and hence , deuterium fractionation ratios such as dco@xmath4/hco@xmath4 ratios are expected to be enhanced through the deuteron transfer reaction from h@xmath3d@xmath4 followed by the electron recombination reaction ( saito et al .",
    "2002 ; aikawa et al .",
    "2003 ) . again",
    ", this is not consistent with the low dco@xmath4/h@xmath5co@xmath4 ratios observed in l1495b , l1521b , and l1521e ( hirota et al .",
    "2001 ) . from these considerations",
    ", it is likely that freeze - out of co and other molecules onto dust grain are not efficient in these two cores as observed by tafalla & santiago ( 2004 )",
    ".    it will be interesting to compare typical time scales for dynamical and chemical evolution .",
    "the timescale for gas - phase chemical reactions is roughly estimated to be 10@xmath10 yr for an h@xmath3 density of 10@xmath10 @xmath8 and a cosmic ray ionization rate of 10@xmath48 s@xmath30 .",
    "this timescale is comparable to the free - fall timescale ( 10@xmath10 yr ) and the timescale of freeze - out of co molecules onto dust grain ( 10@xmath10 yr ) .",
    "the fact that the freeze - out of molecules is not significant in l1495b and l1521b suggests that these two cores are dynamically young .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that l1495b and l1521b are really in the earliest phase of not only chemical evolution but also physical evolution , as in the case of l1521e ( hirota et al . 2002 ; tafalla & santiago 2004 ) .",
    "although it is difficult to infer the ages of l1495b and l1521b quantitatively , they are likely to be less than 10@xmath10 yr .",
    "detailed comparison with chemical models including dynamical evolution ( e.g. aikawa et al .",
    "2003 ) would be interesting .",
    "recently , lee et al . ( 2003 ) found chemically young but physically evolved core ( l1689b ) and chemically evolved but physically young core ( l1512 ) , pointing out that environmental conditions have to be taken into account when modeling the chemistry and physics of molecular cloud cores .",
    "in addition , initial condition of dynamical collapse and timescale of dynamical collapse should be considered in the model of dark cloud cores because these differences would affect the chemical abundance of dark cloud cores ( e.g. aikawa et al .",
    "2003 ) . in order to better outline the physical and chemical properties of l1495b and l1521b , submillimeter continuum observations to map the dust distributions and further detailed molecular line observations ( e.g. ward - thompson et al .",
    "1999 ; tafalla et al .",
    "2002 , 2004 ; tafalla & santiago 2004 ) are needed , which would contribute to the complete understanding of chemical and physical evolution of dark cloud cores .",
    "we carried out mapping and survey observations with several molecular lines toward two known carbon - chain - producing regions in the taurus molecular cloud , l1495b and l1521b .",
    "intense spectra of carbon - chain molecules such as ccs , c@xmath0s , c@xmath1h , hc@xmath0n , and hc@xmath2n were detected , while the nh@xmath0 lines were weak and the n@xmath3h@xmath4 lines were not detected .",
    "distributions of hc@xmath0n , ccs , and c@xmath0s lines in l1495b and l1521b show compact elliptical structure with the radius of 0.063 and 0.044 pc , respectively .",
    "the maps of the ccs lines has only single peak position and they seem to be different from those of well - studied starless cores , l1498 and l1544 , where the distribution of ccs shows a shell - like structure .",
    "since the h@xmath5co@xmath4 lines are detected in l1495b and l1521b , the densities of these cores are higher than 10@xmath10 @xmath8 , which is high enough to excite the nh@xmath0 and n@xmath3h@xmath4 lines , indicating that the abundances of nh@xmath0 and n@xmath3h@xmath4 relative to carbon - chain molecules are very low , as observed in l1521e .",
    "we found that longer carbon - chain molecules such as hc@xmath2n and c@xmath1h are more abundant in tmc-1 than l1495b and l1521b , while those of sulfur - bearing molecules such as c@xmath6s , ccs , and c@xmath0s are comparable .",
    "these characteristic features of molecular abundances in l1495b and l1521b are similar to those of l1521e ( hirota et al . 2002 ) .",
    "therefore , l1495b and l1521b are also in the early stage of chemical evolution , and the depletion factor of heavy atoms are possibly lower than in other evolved cores such as l1544 ( e.g. bergin & langer 1997 ; aikawa et al .",
    "the fact that l1495b , l1521b , and l1521e are found to be the cores with the lowest deuterium fractionation ratio of dnc / hnc and dco@xmath4/hco@xmath4 ( hirota et al . 2001 ; 2002 ; 2003 ) also supports this idea .",
    "these carbon - chain - producing regions , l1495b , l1521b , and l1521e , would be the best targets for observational studies on initial conditions for dense core formation and star formation .",
