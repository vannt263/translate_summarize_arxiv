    "as is the case for gauge - dependent quantities , the gluon propagator can only be defined once that the gauge has been fixed . in the following , we will solely be concerned with the landau gauge , which corresponds to fulfill the condition @xmath14 where @xmath15 are the gauge fields , and @xmath16 the color index .",
    "the gluon propagator in this gauge has the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 at tree level .",
    "when leading order perturbative corrections are taken into account , @xmath2 takes the form @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , at values of the coupling constant corresponding to @xmath0 , @xmath22 , these corrections correspond to a minor change , at most 5% , to the tree level expression .",
    "perturbative corrections to @xmath2 can not therefore account for the higher power of @xmath23 which is necessary to give a confining potential , in the one gluon - exchange approximation",
    ".    an analytic non - perturbative approach to the problem is indeed very difficult . the most elegant and neatest way to attack",
    "the problem is perhaps to solve the dyson - schwinger equations w.r.t .",
    "the renormalized gluon two - point function @xmath24 .",
    "the infinite set of differential equations should satisfy the slavnov - taylor identities in order to preserve gauge invariance .",
    "being the equations non linear , different solutions are allowed @xcite@xcite , and their interpretation , already difficult , is made even more uncertain by the approximations that one has to make to render the problem feasible .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a procedure for deriving the gluon propagator in the minimal landau gauge , is presented .",
    "subsequently , zwanziger confirmed @xcite the solution of ref .",
    "@xcite by repeating the calculation on the lattice . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have shown that this expression fails to reproduce the lattice behaviour .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the first exploratory study on the lattice was presented .",
    "they found that the effective energy is an increasing function of the time ( see below for definition ) , that the gluon propagator violates the spectral decomposition and , in particular , can not have the form ( [ perturbativem ] ) with @xmath25 .",
    "subsequently , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite tried to account for such a behaviour either by including the possible contribution of unphysical particles , or considering the solution proposed in refs .",

    "lately , to interpret the results of the lattice simulations , a new functional form has been proposed @xcite : @xmath26^{-1}. \\label{ourfunc}\\ ] ] this expression tries to mimic the effect of an anomalous dimension for the gauge field , and keeps @xmath2 finite .",
    "the latter is a necessary condition , due to the fact that the lattice possesses an intrinsic infrared cut - off .    according to @xcite @xmath27 , whereas the authors of @xcite quote @xmath28 .",
    "the value of the dimensionful parameter @xmath4 is more controversial , and difficult to determine because it is very small , of the order of the infrared cut - off .",
    "it is not clear whether @xmath4 will vanish in the infinite volume limit .    since there is no a priori theoretical prediction of the functional form ( [ ourfunc ] ) , several further investigations are in order .",
    "namely ,    1 .   reduce the ultraviolet cut - off by increasing the value of @xmath6 , and try to determine @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the continuum limit ;",
    "verify if ( [ ourfunc ] ) contains any gauge - independent information .",
    "this can be investigated by studying the gluon propagator in different gauges .    in this paper",
    ", we address a different issue , that is the dependence of the parameters of equation ( [ ourfunc ] ) on the infrared cut - off . anticipating some of the results",
    ", we have indications that the dimensionful parameter @xmath4 in not merely a finite volume artefact , and it would keep a non - zero value in the infinite volume limit .",
    "its fate in the continuum limit , i.e. as @xmath29 , is not known .",
    "the value of the anomalous dimension @xmath5 , on the other hand , does not seem to be affected by the presence of the infrared regulator .",
    "a major question is the interpretation of a finite value of the gluon propagator , at zero momentum .",
    "in this section , we establish the notation and the main formulae , to be used in the following .",
    "we also give a brief description of the algorithms , i.e. the monte carlo procedure , used to generate statistically independent configurations , and the method which has been used to fix the landau gauge .",
    "we conclude by reporting some information about the accuracy achieved by our gauge - fixing algorithm .      the gluon propagator is studied on the lattice by looking at the euclidean two - point correlation functions : @xmath30 where @xmath31 and the trace is intended over color indices .",
    "the corresponding expression in momentum space is @xmath32    among the possible definitions of the gluon field on the lattice , we choose @xmath33 in a previous publication @xcite , we have discussed in detail the motivations for such choice .    in order to study the gluon propagator in momentum space , @xmath24",
    ", we take the 4-dimensional fourier transform of the correlators ( [ 2pt ] ) . taking into account translation invariance ,",
    "@xmath34 is given by @xmath35 on the lattice , @xmath36 can only take discrete values , @xmath37 , where @xmath16 is the lattice spacing , and @xmath38 .    moreover :    * we always take full advantage of space - time translational symmetry by averaging the previous expression over different points on the euclidean lattice ; * from r.h.s .  of ( [ mom-2pt ] )",
    "the scalar function @xmath2 is extracted , by taking suitable combinations of the spin indices @xmath39 accordingly to ( [ perturbative ] ) . * in order to check the validity of continuum dispersion relation on the lattice , the following four classes of correlators have been considered : 1 .",
    "@xmath40 where @xmath41 and the spatial momentum @xmath42 is non - zero only along axis orthogonal to the spin direction @xmath43 .",
    "2 .   @xmath44 where @xmath45 and the spatial momentum has a non - zero component along the direction of the spin @xmath46 .",
    "3 .   @xmath47 where @xmath41 and @xmath48 .",
    "these correlations do not vanish only when the spatial momentum is non - zero along both @xmath43 and @xmath46 directions .",
    "@xmath49    further investigations of the behaviour of the gluon propagator can be carried on by looking at some correlations , which are functions of the spatial momentum and euclidean time .",
    "for simplicity we maintain the same notation given before , namely , we will consider :    1 .",
    "@xmath50 2 .",
    "@xmath51    all the previous expressions have been computed for the following values of spatial momenta : @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .",
    "moreover , permutations of the three spatial axes have been considered .",
    "the fourier transform , with respect to the time coordinate has been computed allowing @xmath54 to take all the possible values .",
    "namely , @xmath55 with @xmath56 .",
    "we summarize the parameters of the present simulation in tab .",
    "[ tab.setup ] .",
    "the only differences , with respect to ref .",
    "@xcite , are the lattice size and the number of configurations .",
    "all the others parameters of the simulation have been left unchanged , with the purpose of studying the dependence of expression ( [ ourfunc ] ) on each of them . for the generation of the pure gauge fields we adopted a hybrid monte carlo ( hmc ) algorithm in its local version and with a checkerboard update , as described in @xcite .",
    "this version of the hmc allows very short autocorrelation times among pure gauge configurations and is very effective when high statistic measures are needed . in our simulation",
    "we performed an initial termalisation of 1024 iterations and then we extracted configurations every 128 iterations .    a further comment on the size of the statistical sample : although the number of configurations generated during the present run , is a half the old one , we have obtained more accurate results .",
    "this is due to the fact that the larger number of lattice points ( the ratio of the two volumes is about 8) improves the stability of the signal .",
    ".summary of the parameters of the present simulation and of those of the simulation of ref .",
    "[ 1 ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the previous discussion shows that the present gauge - fixing procedure is the most effective one , among those implemented in the literature .",
    "in this section , we outline the unusual behaviour of the effective energy .",
    "then , we consider the dependence of @xmath2 on the momentum . assuming the validity of the functional form ( [ ourfunc ] )",
    ", we first discuss in length systematic effects , and give our final results .",
    "using spectral decomposition and translation invariance , the correlation functions can be rewritten as @xmath57 where the sum is intended over all the states with the quantum numbers of operator @xmath58 and @xmath59 is the energy of the state @xmath43 .",
    "the normalization @xmath60 is positive for physical states . from eq .",
    "( [ spectral ] ) , the effective energy @xmath61 should be a decreasing function of the time , for any value of the momentum @xmath62 .    in figure [ fig.mtutte2 ] , we report @xmath63 computed from the transverse correlators ( [ trans_t ] ) .",
    "@xmath63 is clearly increasing with time , for all the momentum combinations considered .",
    "some authors @xcite tried to justify this result by including ( [ spectral ] ) the contribution of unphysical particles , whose normalization is negative .",
    "the function apt to fit the lattice points , at large time separations , would then be : @xmath64 in our previous paper @xcite , we showed that ( [ 2ma ] ) fails to reproduce the behaviour of @xmath65 .",
    "the apparent agreement of ( [ 2ma ] ) with @xmath66 in ref .",
    "@xcite , was probably faked by the large statistical errors .",
    "the systematic effects discussed in the following are those due to the infrared and ultraviolet cut - offs , introduced when the theory is regularized on a finite lattice .",
    "these effects limit the range of momenta , where reliable results can be obtained .",
    "a way to detect such effects is to look for discrepancies between continuum dispersion relations and their lattice realization .",
    "we note that , contrary to what happens for other quantities , the quenched approximation is not going to produce systematic changes , being the pure gauge sector a self - consistent part of the theory .",
    "one then expects these results to stay valid _ per se _ , as a description of the pure gauge behaviour , although they might differ in the full theory .",
    "another source of systematic uncertainty is the value of lattice spacing , which is found to vary substantially depending on the physical observable used to fix it .",
    "we will only be concerned about this point at the end of this section , when we will express , in physical unit , the propagator at zero momentum .",
    "we discuss the effects of the ultraviolet cut - off , first .",
    "it is known that the presence of a finite ultraviolet cut - off produces unwanted effects , when momenta are of the order of the cut - off itself . on the lattice",
    ", this means that results , corresponding at momenta such that @xmath67 , contain discretization contributions . a demonstration of the above statement ,",
    "is given in figure [ fig.hmom]a , where @xmath2 is plotted as a function of @xmath23 in dimensionless units . in correspondence of the same value of @xmath23",
    ", @xmath2 can have different values , due to the breaking of the lorentz symmetry .",
    "the different results correspond to @xmath2 , as extracted from the four classes of correlators ( [ trans_k])([time_k ] ) .",
    "they agree within errors until @xmath68 where they start clustering into two separated curves .",
    "this behaviour , at larger momenta , is caused by the fact that , in the fourier transforms ( [ trans_k])([time_k ] ) , we only increase @xmath54 , to the larger values allowed on the lattice , while @xmath69 are always kept small . points lying on the higher curve are those generated through spatial correlators ( [ trans_k])([nond_k ] ) , while , on the lower curve , there are the points computed from the temporal correlators ( [ time_k ] ) , which are directly proportional to @xmath70 and so more affected by discretization effects , at large @xmath54 .    to verify this hypothesis ,",
    "we have tried a kinematical correction to the momentum , substituting @xmath71 in the dispersion relation ( [ perturbative ] ) .",
    "such a correction is suggested by the tree level expression of the bosonic propagator on the lattice . in fig .",
    "[ fig.hmom]b , @xmath2 , obtained by performing the substitutions ( [ corre ] ) , is shown .",
    "one sees that the two curves of fig .",
    "[ fig.hmom]a have collapsed into a single one . on a logarithmic scale ,",
    "the curve , obtained by using ( [ corre ] ) appears as a straight line , at large @xmath23 , whose slope is the exponent @xmath72 of equation ( [ ourfunc ] ) . around @xmath73",
    "the curve changes slope and @xmath5 is slightly reduced .",
    "we can not tell whether this behaviour is due to residual cut - off effects , or to the fact that , as the momentum increases , @xmath5 is going towards its perturbative value .",
    "this issue can only be decided by decreasing the lattice spacing , i.e. by going to larger values of @xmath6 , and increasing the range of @xmath23 , where lattice artefacts are small and momenta are large in physical units .",
    "the investigation of the effects of the infrared cut - off is delicate and is directly related to the determination of the value of @xmath4 in ( [ ourfunc ] ) . at very low momenta , different determinations of @xmath2 corresponding to the same value of @xmath23",
    "are inconsistent ( see fig .",
    "this effect is due to the fact that our lattice has different length , along the spatial and temporal axes . in fig .",
    "3 , we indicate , with an arrow , the value of @xmath23 where the differencies became negligible .    we deduce from the previous analysis that one should only take into consideration the region of of intermediate momenta .",
    "more quantitative indications in this sense are provided the fitting procedure , see below .      in the previous section , it has been shown that infrared and ultraviolet effects are reasonably small , only in the intermediate region of momenta . on large volumes ,",
    "the region of momenta `` free '' from cut - off effects contains many points , which can be used to check the stability of the fits .",
    "the fitting function is the dimensionless version of ( [ ourfunc ] ) @xmath74 which depends on three free parameters .",
    "we fit first @xmath2 to expression ( [ fitfunc ] ) , on an interval of 6 points , which we move back and forth in the selected region of momenta .",
    "the fit is then repeated using the same procedure with 8 and 12 points , respectively . in the central region of @xmath23 ,",
    "the results are perfectly compatible on different @xmath23-ranges and their stability improves , by increasing the number of points .    in figure [ fig.3fit ] , we plot the best 12-points fits for @xmath5 and @xmath4 , together with the corresponding value of @xmath75 , as a function of the minimum momentum considered in the fit ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "as anticipated in the previous section , for low and high momenta the fits are rather poor , giving unstable values for the parameters and a large @xmath75 . at momenta @xmath77 the values of @xmath75 lower to @xmath78 and the estimates for @xmath5 and @xmath4 become very stable .",
    "our final determination obtained by averaging over the four points indicated in the figure , is @xmath79 one can compare the present results with those of ref .",
    "we have reanalyzed the old result , by fitting @xmath80 to expression ( [ fitfunc ] ) , in order to make it independent on the lattice volume . ] . on a volume @xmath81",
    "we find : @xmath82",
    "apart from the value of @xmath4 ( see next section ) , the agreement between the two sets of results is reasonably good , and the quality of the fits is satisfactory . by increasing the volume , we have obtained a more accurate estimate of the exponent @xmath5 .    in our previous paper , we have quoted three different sets of results , obtained by studying different correlators , as functions of @xmath23 or @xmath83 respectively .",
    "we interpreted the differences as systematic effects .",
    "we are now able to check this interpretation . on a smaller volume",
    ", we had a limited choice of momenta , before running into problems when @xmath84 or infrared effects become important .",
    "as figure [ fig.lmom ] shows , some of the points we had considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the fit of the propagator in momentum space , ( see eq . ( 19 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , correspond to incompatible estimates of @xmath2 . for this reason , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the fit performed in momentum space , was giving results uncompatible with those of eqs .",
    "( 22 ) and ( 23 ) , and it also disagrees with the present result ( [ quote ] ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , all the values of momenta , ( including those corresponding to @xmath85 ) have been considered in the fit . due to the flattening of the curve in the region of large momenta , the value of @xmath5 has been underestimated .",
    "finally , we observe that the finite value of @xmath86 has a very small effect in the determination of @xmath5 , provided that the range of @xmath23 is large enough .      the main difference between ( [ quote ] ) and ( [ quoteold ] ) is the value on the parameter @xmath4 , which increases with the volume .",
    "this observation rules out the hypothesis that the non - zero value found for @xmath4 is merely due to finite volume effects .",
    "if this were the case , we would expect @xmath4 to scale roughly as @xmath87 .",
    "further arguments may be provided to reinforce the conclusion that @xmath88 . in figure",
    "[ fig.lmom ] , values of @xmath2 measured on a @xmath89 lattice are over - imposed to the present data .",
    "we notice that @xmath90 , whose inverse gives an estimate of @xmath4 , is smaller on the largest volume .",
    "this is opposite to the expectation @xmath91 .",
    "a second argument is provided by the comparison of the fit to the data . in figure",
    "[ fig.ratio ] , the best fitting curve is compared to the lattice numbers , showing a good agreement even outside the fitting range . on the right side , the ratio data to fit shows that the fit overshoots the data , at low momenta .",
    "that is , the behaviour of the propagator at the so called intermediate momenta is consistent with a value of @xmath4 larger than @xmath90 found on the lattice .",
    "this is a further proof that the effect of the infrared cut - off is to fake a value of @xmath4 lower that the real one .",
    "it is possible to try a first , very crude extrapolation of the value of @xmath4 to the infinite volume limit . using @xmath92 we get @xmath93    by using @xmath94 gev ,",
    "as it is determined by several lattice simulations at @xmath0 , this corresponds to @xmath95    it is fundamental to understand the behaviour of @xmath4 in the continuum , i.e. as @xmath96 .",
    "notice that , even if @xmath4 stays finite in this limit , it can not be interpreted as a symptom of symmetry breaking , since , in ( [ ourfunc ] ) , @xmath4 does not represent a pole .",
    "an interpretation of this result , in connection with colour confinement is , at present , absent .",
    "the study of the gluon propagator on different lattice volumes at fixed value of the coupling constant , confirms that @xmath2 is well described by the expression ( [ ourfunc ] ) .",
    "the value of the anomalous dimension @xmath5 has been confirmed to assume a value slightly exceeding @xmath97 . by increasing the volume from @xmath89 to @xmath98",
    ", we have obtained a better determination of the anomalous dimension : @xmath99 .",
    "we find that @xmath4 does not vanish as @xmath87 .",
    "assuming @xmath100 gev , our best estimate is @xmath101 .",
    "further investigations to study the continuum limit and the gauge - dependence of the results presented above are certainly required .",
    "if , ultimately , @xmath4 should stay finite , the comprehension of the mechanism which allows the gluon to develop a mass - scale in the infrared region would call for a theoretical understanding .",
    "we are largely indebted to m. testa for valuable discussions and for the support he gave to this project .",
    "we warmly thank the thinking machines corporation for allowing us to exploit the considerable amount of cpu - time and of memory , needed for the present simulation .",
