    "nucleon - induced charge - exchange reactions provide an extremely useful probe of isovector excitations in nuclei @xcite . in part , this is because cross sections and spin observables for strong transitions at medium energies are described well by distorted - wave impulse approximation ( dwia ) calculations .",
    "more precisely , single - step charge exchange appears to be the dominant reaction mechanism above 100 mev incident energy , with both @xmath4-matrix and @xmath5-matrix interactions successfully describing experimental cross sections when the one - body transition densities are known @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the energy resolution is best at low energies and we have performed a number of studies using the @xmath6 reaction at 135 mev incident energy @xcite .",
    "these includes studies of gamow - teller strength @xcite , stretched states @xcite , and simple particle - hole excitations in closed - shell nuclei @xcite .    in closed - shell nuclei , the predominantly single - step reaction mainly excites one - particle  one - hole ( @xmath7 ) final states .",
    "such excitations are relatively easy to describe theoretically @xcite and comparisons with experimental results can provide important tests of nuclear structure models .",
    "for example , the strongest excitations observed in the ( p , n ) reaction on the closed - shell nuclei @xmath8o and @xmath9ca @xcite are consistent with the predictions of simple shell - model calculations @xcite in the tamm - dancoff approximation ( tda ) , which assumes that the target is a closed core and that the final states are made up of only @xmath7 configurations .",
    "although these shell - model calculations are able to reproduce the relative strengths and the excitation energies fairly well , the absolute strengths calculated in the dwia are generally too large by a factor of two or more . to obtain an understanding of the absolute strengths ,",
    "the inclusion of @xmath10 correlations in the initial and final states is required .",
    "this is done in the extension of the tda to the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "the quenching , or enhancement , of strength for collective states can be clearly demonstrated in simple but realistic schematic models @xcite .",
    "the rpa correlations , and others , can be included in more sophisticated shell - model calculations , which avoid the violations of the pauli principle inherent in the rpa .",
    "for example , in the calculations and analyses of gareev @xmath11 @xcite for @xmath8o , which include selected configurations up to @xmath12 , the normalization factors required for the dwia calculations are much closer to unity .",
    "more recently , calculations have been performed for @xmath8o , which include all configurations up to @xmath13 @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a factor of two quenching with respect to the tda was found for the spin - dipole matrix element between the @xmath8o and @xmath8n ground states .",
    "the basis sizes for such shell - model calculations are typically very large unless a realistic symmetry scheme can be used to truncate the bases ; furthermore , consistency problems not present for @xmath2 or @xmath3 calculations should be addressed @xcite .",
    "the situation is very similar for open - shell nuclei , as exemplified by our studies of the self - conjugate nuclei @xmath14ne , @xmath15 mg , @xmath16si , and @xmath17s @xcite .",
    "most of the experimental @xmath6 spectra and angular distributions are described reasonably well by large - basis shell - model calculations ( still at the @xmath2 or @xmath3 level ) , although some specific transitions are described poorly . as for the closed - shell nuclei ,",
    "the theoretical cross sections typically need to be renormalized by 10% to greater than 50% to agree in magnitude with experiment . in these cases ,",
    "the multi-@xmath18 bases are so large that extended - basis shell - model calculations have not been performed .",
    "the @xmath0c(p , n)@xmath0n reaction that we study in this work provides a more realistic example for tests of extended - basis shell - model calculations .",
    "although such calculations have not yet been performed , the basis sizes are comparable to those for @xmath19 and the calculations should be possible .",
    "there have been many studies of charge - exchange reactions on @xmath0c and references to the older literature may be found in recent papers devoted to @xmath20 @xcite and @xmath6 @xcite studies .",
    "the most prominent peaks in charge - exchange spectra are due to the @xmath21 ground state , a @xmath22 spin - dipole state at @xmath23 mev , and @xmath24 dipole and spin - dipole strength centered around 7 mev .",
    "the resolution in this work is sufficient to exhibit clearly two more peaks and to extract cross sections for a number of other states by peak fitting .",

    "the data reduction is described and spectra are presented in sec .",

    "iv , where existing information on the positive - parity and negative - parity states is summarized and interpreted in terms of shell - model calculations with the cohen - kurath @xcite and millener - kurath @xcite interactions , respectively .",
    "since most of the @xmath0n states of interest are unbound and possess substantial proton decay widths , calculated coulomb energy shifts and decay widths are used to relate the states of @xmath0n to those of @xmath0b , which are better known .",

    "v ; the results are summarized , and conclusions drawn , in sec .  vi .",
    "the measurements were performed at the indiana university cyclotron facility with the beam - swinger system . the experimental arrangement and data reduction procedures were similar to those described previously @xcite .",
    "neutron kinetic energies were measured by the time - of - flight ( tof ) technique .",
    "a beam of 135-mev protons was obtained from the cyclotron in narrow beam bursts typically 350 ps long , separated by 133 ns .",
    "neutrons were detected in three detector stations at 0@xmath1 , 24@xmath1 , and 45@xmath1 with respect to the undeflected proton beam .",
    "the flight paths were 90.9 m , 90.8 m , and 74.4 m ( @xmath250.2 m ) , respectively .",
    "the neutron detectors were rectangular bars of fast plastic scintillator 10.2 cm thick .",
    "two separate detectors , each 1.02 m long by 0.25 m high , were combined for a total frontal area of 0.51 m@xmath26 in the 0@xmath1 station , and two detectors , each 1.02 m long by 0.51 m high , were combined for a total frontal area of 1.04 m@xmath26 in the 24@xmath1 station .",
    "the 45@xmath1 station had two detectors , one 1.02 m long by 0.51 m high and the second 1.02  m long by 1.02  m high , for a total frontal area of 1.55  m@xmath26 .",
    "each neutron detector had tapered plexiglass light pipes attached on the two ends of the scintillator bar , coupled to 12.8-cm diameter phototubes .",
    "timing signals were derived from each end and combined in a mean - timer circuit @xcite to provide the timing signal from each detector .",
    "overall time resolutions of about 825 ps were obtained , including contributions from the beam burst width ( 350 ps ) and energy spread ( 480 ps ) , energy loss in the target ( 300 ps ) , neutron transit times across the 10.2 cm thickness of the detectors ( 550 ps ) , and the intrinsic time dispersion of each detector ( 300 ps ) . this overall time resolution provided an energy resolution of about 350 kev in the first two detector stations and about 480 kev in the widest - angle station .",
    "the large - volume detectors were described in more detail previously @xcite .",
    "protons from the target were rejected by anticoincidence detectors in front of each neutron detector array .",
    "cosmic rays were vetoed by anticoincidence detectors on top as well as the ones at the front of each array .",
    "the @xmath0c target was a 31.4 mg / cm@xmath26 natural target ( 98.9% @xmath0c ) .",
    "the tof spectra were obtained at 12 angles between 0@xmath1 and 63@xmath1 .",
    "spectra from each detector were recorded at many pulse - height thresholds from 25 to 90 mev equivalent - electron energy ( mevee ) .",
    "calibration of the pulse - height response of each of the detectors was performed with a @xmath28th source ( which emits a 2.61-mev gamma ray ) and a calibrated fast amplifier .",
    "the values of the cross sections extracted for different thresholds were found to be the same within statistics .",
    "the values of the cross sections reported are at a threshold setting of 40 mevee .",
    "the experimental procedure and data reduction are similar to those described in more detail in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "excitation - energy spectra were obtained from the measured tof spectra using the known flight paths and a calibration of the time - to - amplitude converter . known",
    "states in the residual nucleus @xmath0n provided absolute reference points .",
    "excitation energies are estimated to be accurate to 0.1 mev or better ; for example , to 50 kev for several of the peaks listed in table i. the excitation - energy spectra for five angles at roughly @xmath29 intervals are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] .",
    "yields for individual transitions were obtained by fitting peaks in the tof spectra .",
    "the spectra were fitted with an improved version of the peak - fitting code of bevington @xcite . because the proton threshold in the residual nucleus , @xmath0n , is at 0.60 mev ,",
    "all the final states are unbound except for the g.s . ;",
    "consequently , we fit the ( p , n ) spectra using lorentzian line shapes folded together with a gaussian line shape to account for the experimental resolution .",
    "the gaussian width was determined from the fit to the g.s .",
    "peak in each spectrum .",
    "we set the widths of the lorentzians to be the widths accepted in the compilation of ajzengerg - selove @xcite , except for the strong , broad 2@xmath30 , 4@xmath30 complex at 4.3 mev and the @xmath31 , @xmath32 peak at 5.4 mev , which were fitted here to obtain new values , as discussed below .",
    "the fits included a cubic polynomial background that provided a shape very much like that of calculated quasi - free scattering [ i.e. , ( p , pn ) ] spectra as presented previously @xcite .",
    "examples of the fitting are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] .",
    "note that a small  tail \" is observed on the large g.s .",
    "peak , which is fitted with an additional gaussian ( see the two forward - angle spectra in fig .  [",
    "fig : spec ] ) .",
    "such tails are commonly observed in neutron tof spectra and arise from time - slewing of lower pulse - height events .",
    "the area of this tail is @xmath333% of the total peak area and is included in the area for the peak .",
    "such tails can not be observed on the broader unbound states . in general , the fits were judged to be good .",
    "there always remains the question of the background under peaks in the continuum region .",
    "this uncertainty affects primarily the high - lying states above 6 mev .",
    "the results we present here represent a lower limit for these levels because we are not considering contributions from the underlying continuum , such as one might obtain in a  multipole analysis \" of the entire spectrum , for example .",
    "we allowed the excitation energy and the lorentzian width for the 2@xmath30 , 4@xmath30 complex to vary because we observed that both changed in a systematic way from forward angles to backward angles as the dominant level changed from the 2@xmath30 to the 4@xmath30 state .",
    "these levels are broad ( @xmath33800 kev ) and excited strongly so that we could determine , with the experimental resolution of 350 kev in this work , the energies and the widths for both levels ; in addition , we could extract an excitation energy and width for the 5.4-mev peak from the two spectra , at @xmath34 and @xmath35 , in which the peak is most prominent .",
    "the excitation energies and the widths of states observed in this work are compared with the compilation values in table i.    cross sections were obtained by combining the yields with the measured geometrical parameters , the beam integration , and the target thickness .",
    "neutron efficiencies were obtained from a monte carlo computer code @xcite , which was tested extensively at these energies @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty in the cross section is dominated by the uncertainty in the detector efficiencies , which is estimated to be @xmath36 .",

    "there is less structure in the transverse response , although a peak is observed at 22.7 mev @xcite .",
    "the same peaks are seen in @xmath147 reactions with @xmath159 angular distributions , except that the 23.8-mev structure is resolved into two relatively narrow components at about 23.5 and 23.9 mev @xcite .",
    "in addition , the @xmath202 reaction has been used to separate @xmath155 and @xmath142 contributions to the response @xcite .",
    "we have chosen to analyze the strong dipole peak in our spectra in terms of peaks at 6.4 and 7.3 mev , with widths of 1200 kev , on the basis of structure observed in the @xmath0c@xmath40he@xmath41n reaction @xcite .",
    "we have also included peaks , with the same widths , at 8.2 , 9.1 , and 10.0 mev to account for strength that is apparent in fig .  2 above the fitted background on the high - energy side of the main dipole peak .",
    "such a tail is observed in other experiments @xcite and is expected on the basis of shell - model and rpa calculations @xcite .",
    "the energies of the 8.2- and 10.0-mev peaks coincide roughly with those of structure in the giant dipole resonance , referred to above , but the widths are chosen arbitrarily .",
    "also , strength is observed at 9.9 mev in the @xmath0c@xmath40he@xmath41n and @xmath0c@xmath40he@xmath203c spectra of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the angular distributions for all five states are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gdr ] , together with the summed strength for the entire region .",
    "the angular distributions of the 6.4- and 7.3-mev states , which are quite similar in shape and magnitude , are clearly consistent with the calculated dipole angular distributions of the third or fourth @xmath24 states , to which they are compared .",
    "the angular distributions for the 8.2- and 10.0-mev states also appear to be dipole in nature , while the strength at 9.1 mev is rather weak .    for reference , the predicted cross sections at @xmath204 @xmath146 for pure dipole , spin - dipole @xmath24 and spin - dipole @xmath22 states , using harmonic oscillator wave functions , are 2.97 , 12.07 , and 13.38 mb / sr , respectively .",
    "the cross sections for the central interaction alone are 2.97 , 6.43 , and 11.63 mb / sr . for the tensor interaction alone ,",
    "the cross sections are 0 , 1.06 , and 3.11 mb / sr .",
    "thus , there is strong constructive interference between the central and tensor interactions for the @xmath24 spin - dipole state ; the effect of the tensor force on the angular distribution can be seen by comparing the theoretical curves for the @xmath123 and @xmath124 model states in fig .",
    "[ fig : gdr ] .",
    "the @xmath124 model state contains more than half of the dipole and spin - dipole strength predicted in this region @xcite .",
    "the @xmath123 model state carries most of the @xmath155 dipole strength and has a calculated cross section which is one third that of the @xmath124 state on account of the relative weakness of the spin - independent interaction at 135 mev .",
    "the predicted cross section for the @xmath126 and @xmath127 states , mostly due to the @xmath127 state , is about half that of the @xmath124 state .",
    "the @xmath125 state also contains considerable spin - dipole strength @xcite , which should be rather broadly distributed because of a large @xmath119-wave proton decay width to the 4.8-mev @xmath68 state of @xmath98c ( see table v ) .    the near equality in cross section for the 6.4- and 7.3-mev peaks , seen also for the @xmath40he@xmath171 cross sections ,",
    "suggests that the peaks contain comparable amounts of dipole and spin - dipole strength in contradiction to the detailed predictions of the @xmath3 shell model .",
    "thus , it is more appropriate to compare the summed strength ( both absolute and relative to the @xmath22 spin - dipole strength at 4.2 mev ) to model predictions and to that observed in other experiments .",
    "the latter comparison is of particular interest because the subtraction of background in the giant resonance region is a difficult and not clearly defined procedure .",
    "the comparison in table vii shows that our summed cross section of @xmath205 mb / sr is slightly lower than that extracted in other @xmath6 and @xmath20 experiments at @xmath206 mev incident energy .",
    "the theoretical prediction for the summed @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 model states is 7.9 mb / sr if harmonic oscillator wave functions are used .",
    "we expect that this value would be reduced by factor approaching two if more realistic radial wave functions were used and if an extended shell - model calculation to take into account ground - state correlations were performed ; more specifically , the rpa calculations reported in ref .",
    "@xcite give @xmath207 the @xmath159 cross section of the @xmath208 shell - model calculation and our estimate for the ratio of the cross sections for the @xmath113 state with woods - saxon and harmonic oscillator wave functions is @xmath209 ( see sec .",
    "the @xmath0c@xmath42n reaction was studied at 135 mev with energy resolutions of 350 to 425 kev .",
    "angular distributions were extracted for all peaks observed up through the region of the giant dipole resonance at an excitation energy of around 7 mev . in most cases ,",
    "the peaks are thought to contain contributions from more than one state and , where possible , peak fitting was carried out .",
    "the @xmath210 assignments for some of the states are already known ; for the other cases , identifications were made by comparing the angular distributions with dwia calculations and by comparing with the known analog states in @xmath0c and @xmath0b . in this connection ,",
    "the coulomb energy shifts and nucleon decay widths were estimated theoretically for negative - parity states using the known spectrum of @xmath0b as a starting point , along with the shell - model structure of the states .    in the first few mev , we see the @xmath21 ground state , an unresolved complex containing the @xmath59 state at 0.96 mev and a @xmath22 state at 1.19 mev , and a weakly excited @xmath24 state at 1.8 mev .",
    "the analogs of these states are all well known .",
    "the @xmath6 angular distributions agree with the analog @xmath147 angular distributions for the @xmath21 ground state and the @xmath59,@xmath22 complex at 1 mev .",
    "we do not see the reported @xmath54 state at 2.44 mev , but this is not surprising because the predicted cross section is very weak .    from peak fitting , we see evidence for weakly excited states at 3.2 and 3.5 mev , which form a shoulder to the strongly excited 4.3-mev peak .",
    "these states should correspond to states seen clearly at 3.14 and 3.57 mev via the @xmath0c@xmath40he@xmath171 reaction .",
    "the major contributors to the cross sections for these two peaks are most likely the @xmath32 and @xmath24 analogs of states in @xmath0b at 3.39 and 4.30 mev .",
    "the analog of the 3.76-mev @xmath59 state of @xmath0b may contribute also to the 3.5-mev peak ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ex35 ] ) . between 4.1 and 4.3 mev , we see the @xmath22,@xmath182 complex with known analogs in @xmath0c and @xmath0b . at forward angles ,",
    "the @xmath22 state is strongest , and at backward angles , the @xmath182 state dominates .",
    "this fact allowed us to obtain estimates of the excitation energies and widths of the @xmath22 and @xmath182 states from analyses of the low-@xmath153 and high-@xmath153 data . at 5.4 mev , we see clearly a peak with an angular distribution that could be described by the excitation of either the @xmath31 or the @xmath32 states known in the analog nuclei , or by a combination of both ( the predicted cross sections are comparable ) . between 6 and 8 mev , we see a broad distribution of strength described well by a @xmath159 angular distribution .",
    "we have analyzed this strength in terms of three peaks , with the two strongest ones , at 6.4 and 7.3 mev , based on a previous analysis of @xmath40he@xmath171 data @xcite .",
    "these states carry a significant fraction of the @xmath24 dipole and spin - dipole strength , although there could be some @xmath22 strength in this region as well .",
    "a major difficulty in the giant resonance region , as in all such studies , is an uncertainty in the background contribution .",
    "all the states below 6-mev excitation energy in @xmath0b , and thus @xmath0n , and the essential features of the dipole and spin - dipole strength in the giant resonance region can be accounted for by @xmath2 shell - model calculations for the positive - parity states and by @xmath3 calculations for the negative - parity states . for these restricted model spaces ,",
    "there are substantial core - polarization corrections to the shell - model transition densities to be used in inelastic scattering calculations .",
    "a major effect for the isovector transitions of interest is a substantial quenching of transition strength at low momentum transfer for most multipoles .",
    "the loose binding of the final - state single - particle wave functions makes it important to use realistic single - particle wave functions , although it is difficult to do this precisely for unbound final states in @xmath0n ; the lack of overlap between initial- and final - state wave functions generally leads to substantial reductions in cross section compared to those calculated with harmonic - oscillator wave functions . in the absence of satisfactory multi-@xmath18 shell - model calculations for @xmath65 , scaling",
    "factors for certain @xmath57 obdme are introduced . with a few exceptions",
    ", this procedure results in a consistent description of @xmath58 form factors and @xmath6 angular distributions up to @xmath211 @xmath146 ; the quenching factors show a systematic behavior for @xmath46-shell nuclei and are in qualitative agreement with perturbative estimates .",
    "a notable exception occurs for the @xmath212 level , not resolved in our @xmath6 data but observed in @xmath147 , where the @xmath6 or @xmath147 cross section is driven by the tensor force . at higher @xmath153 , the @xmath58 and @xmath6 cross sections often exceed the distorted - wave predictions , a phenomenon clearly evident but not well understood for the ground - state transition ( the excitation of particles to higher orbits by the tensor force is known to provide a significant contribution ) .",
    "the good energy resolution of the present experiment has enabled us to extract cross - section data for more states than previous @xmath6 experiments .",
    "the new states include the broad @xmath24 state at 1.8 mev , the @xmath32 state at 3.13 mev , the second @xmath24 state at 3.5 ( this peak should also contain a contribution from the second @xmath59 state ) and a @xmath31 , @xmath32 doublet near 5.4 mev ; in addition , new information on the excitation energies and widths of the @xmath22 and @xmath182 members of the 4.3-mev doublet has been extracted from the data at momentum transfers where one or another of the states dominates the cross section .",
    "the calculated shifts in excitation energy from @xmath0b to @xmath0n for negative - parity states are in good agreement with the data for known states of @xmath0n , and lend strong support to the assignment of a @xmath24 state in the 3.5-mev complex .",
    "likewise , the calculated proton decay widths for the negative - parity states are in generally good agreement with the widths extracted from @xmath40he@xmath171 data and the present @xmath6 data .",
    "the result is a better understanding of the spectrum of @xmath0n .",
