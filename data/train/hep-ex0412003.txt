    "charm - meson decay dynamics has been extensively studied in the last decade .",
    "the analysis of the three - body final state by fitting dalitz plots has proved to be a powerful tool for investigating effects of resonant substructure , interference patterns , and final state interactions in the charm sector @xcite .",
    "the isobar formalism , which has traditionally been applied to charm amplitude analyses , represents the decay amplitude as a sum of relativistic breit - wigner propagators multiplied by form factors plus a term describing the angular distribution of the two body decay of each intermediate state of a given spin .",
    "many amplitude analyses require detailed knowledge of the light - meson sector . in the case of a narrow , isolated resonance",
    ", there is a close connection between the position of the pole on the unphysical sheet and the peak we observe in experiments at real values of the energy .",
    "however , when a resonance is broad and overlaps with other resonances , this connection is lost .",
    "the breit - wigner parameters measured on the real axis ( mass and width ) can be connected to the pole - positions in the complex energy plane only through models of analytic continuation .    a formalism for studying overlapping and",
    "many channel resonances has been proposed long ago and is based on the _ k - matrix _ @xcite parametrization .",
    "this formalism , originating in the context of two - body scattering , can be generalized to cover the case of production of resonances in more complex reactions @xcite , with the assumption that the two - body system in the final state is an isolated one and that the two particles do not simultaneously interact with the rest of the final state in the production process @xcite .",
    "the _ k - matrix _ approach allows us to include the positions of the poles in the complex plane directly in our analysis , thus directly incorporating the results from spectroscopy experiments .",
    "full details on event selection and analysis cuts are reported in @xcite .",
    "the dalitz plot analyses are performed on events within @xmath8 the nominal @xmath5 or @xmath6 mass ( fig .",

    "@xmath13 are breit - wigner terms . the amplitude for the particular channel @xmath14 can be written in the context of the _ k - matrix _ formalism as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the identity matrix , @xmath17 is the _ k - matrix _ describing the isoscalar @xmath12-wave scattering process , @xmath18 is the phase - space matrix for the five channels , and @xmath19 is the  initial \" production vector into the five channels . in this picture",
    ", the production process can be viewed ( figure [ kmcartoon ] ) as consisting of an initial preparation of several states , which are then propagated by the @xmath20 term into the final one .",

    "the _ k - matrix _ treatment of the @xmath12-wave component of the decay amplitude allows for a direct interpretation of the decay mechanism in terms of the five virtual channels considered : @xmath22 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the resulting picture , for both @xmath5 and @xmath6 decay , is that the @xmath12-wave decay is dominated by an initial production of @xmath41 , @xmath44 and @xmath40 states .",
    "dipion production is always much smaller .",
    "this suggests that in both cases the @xmath12-wave decay amplitude primarily arises from a @xmath45 contribution such as that produced by the cabibbo favoured weak diagram for the @xmath5 and one of the two possible singly cabibbo suppressed diagrams for the @xmath6 . for the @xmath6 ,",
    "the @xmath45 contribution competes with a @xmath46 contribution . that the @xmath47 appears as a peak in the @xmath22 mass distribution in @xmath6 decay , as it does in @xmath5 decay , shows that for the @xmath12-wave component the @xmath48 contribution dominates . comparing the relative @xmath12-wave fit fractions that we observe for @xmath5 and @xmath6",

    "the @xmath12-wave decay fraction for the @xmath5 ( 87% ) is larger than that for the @xmath6 ( 56% ) . rather than coupling to an @xmath12-wave dipion , the @xmath46 piece prefers to couple to a vector state like @xmath49 which accounts for @xmath50% of the @xmath6 decay .",
    "this interpretation also bears on the role of the annihilation diagram in the @xmath51 decay .",
    "our data suggest that the @xmath12-wave annihilation contribution is negligible over much of the dipion mass spectrum .",

    "the traditional set is : @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 . according to flavor su(3 ) symmetry",
