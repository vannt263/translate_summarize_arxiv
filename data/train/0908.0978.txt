    "how molecular clouds collapse to form protostars is an important question in modern astronomy and cosmology . since hydrodynamic collapse models for star formations in molecular clouds were first proposed in the 1960s ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "these progressive research advancement leads us to a more realistic understanding of the star formation processes in molecular clouds .",
    "in particular , the gas flow velocity , mass density and thermal temperature structures of collapsing clouds predicted by theoretical models are in principle testable by various high - resolution spectral imaging observations in different bands of tracer molecular line profiles ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "a widely discussed scenario for the formation of low - mass protostars is the so - called ` inside - out collapse ' model @xcite . in this model ,",
    "a condensed cloud core becomes unstable gravitationally and collapses rapidly towards the centre to form a protostellar core .",
    "the protostar is embedded in a dusty envelope , which is presumed to be static , although in some variations of the model the envelope may also involve an infall or an outflow ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . the boundary between the collapsing core and the envelope expands , engulfing more and more mass into the central collapsing core .",
    "the accretion of dusty materials from the envelope forms a disc rotating about the central protostar , and magnetized bipolar outflows may occur from the disc at the same time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "isothermal _ inside - out collapse scenario as advanced by shu et al .",
    "( 1987 )    different from the inside - out collapse scenario for a molecular cloud , there are alternative models to describe the formation of low - mass protostars within molecular clouds , e.g. the isothermal bonnor - ebert sphere embedded in an external medium of finite pressure @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this model describes the hydrostatic equilibrium of a gaseous sphere with a constant kinetic temperature , while a central core with finite density is involved .",
    "such a hydrostatic sphere can be maintained as long as the mass of the cloud does not exceed the critical value of @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the isothermal sound speed and @xmath7 is the gravitational constant .",
    "with density profile and kinetic temperature being the two key aspects , dynamic instability is predicted therein , but no flow velocity is presumed .",
    "recent research shows that the hydrostatic bonnor - ebert sphere may match several observed properties of starless cores ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while it can not account for the observational data of b335 source ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this isothermal sphere model with a finite mass in a hydrostatic equilibrium can not fully describe observations of molecular line profiles in the cloud core because of the very isothermal assumption as we shall show presently in the following sections .",
    "the larson - penston ( lp ) self - similar solution @xcite of an isothermal sphere is a classic dynamic model for low - mass star formation .",
    "this lp type model predicts the formation of stellar density cores around the centre of molecular clouds .",
    "characterisitcally , the decreasing - towards - centre radial collapse speed profiles is obtained along with corresponding mass density profiles .",
    "however , the isothermal assumption encounters the similar problem of the bonnor - ebert sphere for modelling the observed molecular line profiles . relaxing the dynamic self - consistency ,",
    "all these models may be partially applied semi - empirically to star formation clouds for developing diagnostics .",
    "for example , recent empirical works make use of the millimetre continuum emission and provide empirical thermodynamic ( density and temperature ) profiles ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these model results offer an independent perspective to probe star - forming clouds , but the overall dynamic profiles lack the desired self - consistency .",
    "in reference to these dynamic models , current observations and empirical works , the polytropic eecc solution ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* lou & hu 2009 ) appears to be a sensible alternative . with radial velocity fields , corresponding density profiles and variable temperature profiles",
    ", this self - similar dynamic model should be more practical and versatile in explaining different observations ( lou & gao 2006 ) .",
    "molecular emission lines provide valuable observational diagnostics to probe the dynamics and physical conditions in star - forming clouds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for examples , optically thick emission lines of tracer molecules h@xmath0co , hco@xmath8 , co , cs and n@xmath0h@xmath9",
    "are frequently identified for such diagnostic purposes . however , there are still unknown and uncertain parameters as well as model degeneracies to explain the line strengths and profiles , due to global hydrodynamics , macro- and micro - scale kinematics , thermal structures , chemical compositions and turbulence .",
    "it is thus important to resolve these issues step by step to avoid ambiguities in spectral modelling as well as in both observational and theoretical interpretations .    to date",
    ", most molecular line profile calculations assume a certain parametrization for the density , velocity and temperature structures within emitting clouds .",
    "for example , in @xcite , the so - called ` exact theory ' takes the density and velocity profiles from the _ isothermal _ dynamic model of @xcite but the temperature profile is assigned separately with a certain empirical base and therefore the gas cloud model is actually _ non - isothermal _ for molecular line calculations .",
    "this is a worthwhile attempt , yet such a specification of the radial temperature structure is unsatisfactory as there are inconsistencies in the velocity and density profiles of an _ isothermal _ cloud from the theoretical perspective . in recent years , calculations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) considered more structural complexities in star - forming molecular clouds and invoked a more sophisticated radiative transfer model that incorporates the relevant atomic processes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these studies aimed at resolving specific issues , such as the chemical profiles ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) or the competition between relevant atomic processes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "as the effects of dynamical and thermal structures were not their prime objective , most of these calculations basically parameterized the density , velocity and temperature structures in a collapsing cloud or simply adopted the isothermal inside - out collapse model of shu ( 1977 ) but took an empirical temperature profile from observations of dust continuum .",
    "the key question now is : does it make a difference if the structure profile of a cloud is determined self - consistently through a polytropic hydrodynamic model analysis instead of using a simple isothermal inside - out model but with a non - isothermal temperature profile ? also , are the molecular line profiles different for models with different polytropic indices of the gas dynamics ?",
    "these questions are essential for our understanding of the dynamics and physical conditions , in particular , in the early stage of forming low - mass protostars .",
    "the objective of our study here is to address this issue quantitatively .",
    "for instance , we calculate h@xmath0co 140  ghz molecular line profiles using a self - similar hydrodynamic model that involves a conventional polytropic equation of state ( eos ) [ hu & lou 2008 ] louwang06,lou2006,wang2008 and an isothermal inside - out collapse model @xcite , and carefully compare their differences",
    ". we also directly compare the h@xmath0co 140  ghz molecular line profiles obtained from the conventional polytropic model @xcite with observations , using the molecular cloud b335 as a test example .",
    "comparison of our theoretical approach with empirical approaches used in former works is also made . in principle , our model calculations can be readily adapted to line profiles of tracer molecules of more or less constant abundances in star - forming clouds .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we present model structures of conventional polytropic and isothermal inside - out collapse models with their flow velocity , density and temperature profiles .",
    "the relevant parameters and scalings of dynamic models are also specified there .",
    "we provide an overview for the formation of molecular line profiles in star - forming clouds in this section . in section 3",
    ", we present the results of calculations , the comparison of the lines obtained by dynamical models and the comparison of the theoretical with the observed molecular line profiles .",
    "effects due to the cloud temperature gradient , optical depth , intrinsic line width , polytropic index and the presence of a relatively dense central kernel are also considered .",
    "finally , results of our analysis are summarized in section 4 . for the convenience of reference",
    ", we summarize the basic polytropic hydrodynamics and the relevant asymptotic self - similar solutions in appendix a , elaborate on how the blue and red peaks of a molecular line profile are shaped in an optically thick cloud in appendix b , and lay out the radiative transfer formulation and our ray - tracing computation algorithm in appendix c.",
    "three self - similar hydrodynamic models for the velocity , density and temperature profiles are considered in our molecular line - profile calculations , namely model i , a hydrodynamic collapse model with a conventional polytropic eos for the gas ( * ? ? ?",

    "a self - similar dynamic solution is adopted for the collapsing core in both model i and ii . for model i ,",

    "the dimensionless variables are converted to corresponding dimensional physical variables in order to perform radiative transfer calculations for molecular line profiles in core collapsing clouds .",
    "we adopt parameter values estimated from observations for the scalings of the dynamic profiles for model clouds .",
    "the typical infall radius within a molecular cloud is estimated as @xmath24  pc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , corresponding to @xmath25  au .",
    "as dimensionless infall radii are roughly around and larger than @xmath26 in our model ( e.g. @xmath27 by fig .",

    "in addition to the central protostar , we presume a number density of @xmath36 @xmath37 at the very central region ( i.e. @xmath38au ) of a molecular cloud and set the central velocity to be zero for a static dense kernel . the outer cloud radius is set to be several tens of @xmath39 au .",
    "we note that the size of the static dense kernel and the outer radius of the cloud are not the same as used in some previous works ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the difference between cloud sizes used in our model analysis and those of earlier research works should not affect our basic conclusions .",
    "nevertheless , we should keep in mind that this conclusion is made under the assumption that the abundance of tracer molecule remains constant in our model consideration .",
    "the cloud sizes would matter if the fractional abundances of certain tracer molecules vary considerably in star forming clouds .    for comparison , the velocity , number density and temperature profiles of the three different models that we use in radiative transfer calculations of molecular line profiles",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dynamicdata ] . in all models , the velocity and temperature increase monotonically towards the centre until @xmath40 au .",
    "there are slight differences between the density and velocity profiles of model i ( @xmath3 ) and model ii .",

    "as shown , cloud structures can vary substantially even within model i ( in fact , model ii can be regarded as a special case of model i ) , and such differences can leave signatures in the emission molecular line profiles as expected .",
    "we utilize a simple ray - tracing radiative transfer model ( which does not involve an explicit treatment of atom and molecular transitions and their couplings with the radiation field ; see appendix c for details ) to calculate the spectral profile of molecule h@xmath0co",
    "( 2@xmath48 - 1@xmath49 ) emission line at frequency 140  ghz . as the range of temperature variation in a cloud region is typically small ( e.g. @xmath50 k )",
    ", the variation in tracer molecular level populations is small and thus will affect line profiles little ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it has been argued that gradients in distributions of chemical elements as well as chemical evolution are important in determining the strengths and profiles of molecular emission lines from star - forming clouds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as we focus on the effect of dynamical cloud structures on tracer molecule line profiles , the h@xmath0co abundance is taken to be approximately constant in our model calculations .",
    "this simplification implies that our approach may be extended to those tracer molecules with more or less constant abundances in star forming clouds .",
    "this assumption of constant abundance was invoked in some earlier works ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while in others , the h@xmath0co abundance in b335 cloud was assumed to be a step function with a variation of @xmath51 times ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "both theoretically and observationally , clarifications of the relative importance of dynamical and chemical effects are essential in using molecular line profiles as a reliable diagnostic probe to the core collapse dynamics in star - forming clouds .",
    "a more comprehensive description of star - forming clouds should involve self - consistent dynamic profiles and chemical abundance profiles that are independently inferred from observations .    in order to have an intuitive feeling for our model approach , we demonstrate in appendix b how the blue and red peaks of emission molecular line profiles are formed in an optically thick cloud . the radiative transfer analysis and the computing algorithm of our line profile calculations",
    "are described in appendix c. the physical variables ( i.e. temperature @xmath52 , mass density @xmath53 , projected velocity component @xmath54 etc . ) of a core collapsing molecular cloud are determined from our polytropic hydrodynamic model ( see appendix a ) .",
    "the line - centre opacity @xmath2 and the line width @xmath55 are set to values typical of spectral line observations of tracer molecules . in equations ( [ rteq])@xmath56([equ : taucell ] ) , the mass density @xmath53 is mainly that of the interstellar medium in a cloud . as a consequence ,",
    "the ratio of molecular abundance is merged into the parameter @xmath2 , which is then effectively a product of molecular line centre opacity and its mass fractional ratio .",
    "a simple assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) is made for the radiative transfer calculation ; this calculation does not account for scattering dominated processes , masers , or other non - lte cases .",
    "it is clear that model ii does not produce asymmetric double - peak h@xmath0co 140  ghz line profiles ( see the dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra4 ] and equations  ( [ diff_intensity ] ) and ( [ diff_temperature ] ) in appendix b ) , an apparent contradiction to extensive line profile observations in molecular globules . therefore , unless compromising the self - consistency in the thermal structure and dynamics to insert a semi - empirical temperature profile to replace the isothermal model , as in model iii , one can not have a sensible comparison between the observed asymmetric double - peak line profiles of star - forming clouds and the line profiles calculated from model ii . in fact , equation ( [ diff_temperature ] ) in appendix b clearly demands that the temperature should increase towards the cloud centre in order to produce a molecular line profile with a blue peak being stronger than the red peak for a core collapsing cloud .",
    "[ fig : spectra4 ] ( see also fig",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , self - consistency of the dynamic profiles should be demanded for a more satisfying model construction .",
    "we emphasize that the temperature profile is determined simultaneously once we derive mass density and flow velocity profiles from conventional polytropic hydrodynamic equations . instead ,",
    "when one uses an empirical temperature profile for molecular line profile calculations , this empirical temperature profile and the density and velocity profiles are generally not consistent with each other in the hydrodynamic and thermodynamic sense .",
    "in other words , a gas cloud with dynamic profiles having no self - consistency does not exist according to hydrodynamics and thermodynamics .",
    "it should be also noted that the inference of empirical temperature profiles must also rely on several assumptions .",
    "our goal is to develop theoretical models grossly satisfying available observational constraints .",
    "our calculations show that in both model i ( @xmath3 ) and model iii , the asymmetry in line profiles can be more pronounced in the off - centre region in a cloud , provided the ray of emission along the line - of - sight passes through the collapsing core of the cloud ( compare the left and middle panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra4 ] ) .",
    "the relative strengths of the blue and red peaks in a molecular line profile show a stronger contrast in model iii than in model i ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "this sharper contrast in two peaks from model iii is due to the fact that there are more variations in the specified semi - empirical temperature profile than those in the temperature profile of model i ( @xmath3 ) that we adopt .",
    "model ii produces symmetric single - peak molecular line profiles in the resolved spectra by our numerical explorations ( see three dashed curves of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra4 ] ) , while model i ( @xmath3 ) and model iii could produce single peak line profiles when the rays are along the line - of - sight passing through only the static outer envelope or when velocity variations are insignificant in the emission region as compared with the intrinsic velocity broadening @xmath55 of h@xmath0co 140  ghz line .",

    "[ fig : spectrad ] shows how the two peaks in h@xmath0co 140  ghz line profile vary with the value of the line centre opacity @xmath2 . with density distribution",
    "being fixed , the opacity @xmath2 characterizes the optical depth along the ray parallel to the line - of - sight . for forming asymmetric blue and red peaks ,",
    "molecular line profiles need to be optically thick , in addition to the presence of variable temperature and velocity structures within molecular clouds involving gravitational core collapse . for molecular lines that are optically thin , the observed emissions sample the entire collapsing core .",
    "a cloud structure of spherical symmetry for the near and far hemispheres inevitably gives rise to symmetric molecular line profiles , in spite of the temperature , density and velocity variations in the emission region .",
    "moreover , as the line is optically thin , the line intensity is well below the source planck function .",
    "hence the line intensity becomes weaker , i.e. the corresponding brightness temperature is lower than the thermal temperature of line emission regions ( see equation [ diff_temperature ] and discussions thereafter for an intuitive explanation for the formation of a double - peak line profile ) .    for comparisons of dynamic models",
    ", we have adopted that the intrinsic line width @xmath57 .",
    "there are uncertainties in the values of @xmath55 and we have chosen a typical value here . it is generally believed that the intrinsic width of a molecular line is mainly caused by thermal broadening and micro - turbulence . the thermal broadening is estimated to be at a level of @xmath58 for a typical molecular cloud with a thermal temperature of @xmath51  k. the turbulent broadening is fairly uncertain .",
    "theoretical estimates depend on the assumed driving mechanisms ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . some observational studies ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ) show that the probable line width @xmath55 ranges from a few @xmath59 to about several @xmath60 .",
    "typically , infall velocities @xmath61 in cloud cores would range from @xmath62 to a few @xmath60 , as adopted in the dynamic models explored here .",
    "the characteristic double - peak signature of molecular line profiles from a collapsing cloud may be erased or smeared if the line suffers a severe turbulent broadening ( i.e. large @xmath55 ) .",
    "right panel of fig  [ fig : spectrad ] demonstrates that for model i ( @xmath3 ) with a maximum infall velocity of @xmath63 , we can produce a double - peak line profile for @xmath64 but not for @xmath65 .",
    "extensive observations of double - peak line profiles in many molecular globules imply that the turbulence in their line formation region should not give rise to velocity broadenings significantly larger than @xmath66 with a maximum infall velocity @xmath63 . by a further numerical exploration , we find that the maximum allowed velocity broadening bears a linear relationship with the maximum infall speed ; the values shown here are typical for star - forming clouds .",
    "one appealing aspect of model i is that we can obtain self - consistent velocity , density and temperature profiles for molecular clouds within the overall inside - out collapse scenario .",
    "the essence of this model is the conventional polytropic equation of state characterized by a polytropic index @xmath1 .",
    "the special isothermal case ( model ii ) just corresponds to @xmath10 .",
    "now our question is : how robust is the molecular line profile morphology with respect to the variation of @xmath1 ?",
    "we calculate h@xmath0co 140  ghz emission line profiles using model i with three different polytropic indices @xmath13 , 1.2 and 1.3 .",
    "these @xmath1 values are representative of astrophysical situations between limiting regimes , e.g. the isothermal process of @xmath67 , and the adiabatic processes of @xmath68 and @xmath69 for diatomic and monoatomic gases respectively .",
    "we found that the overall morphology of molecular line profiles is quite robust with respect to variations of @xmath1 , provided that the effective line - centre opacities in the calculations take on the same values ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrapoly ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath11 for a conventional polytropic gas , i.e. a variation of @xmath1 leads to a variation of @xmath12 , which is related to the scalings of hydrodynamic variables .",
    "there are however some small and subtle differences among predicted molecular line profiles .",
    "for instance , larger @xmath1 tends to give more prominent peaks in a line profile , which can be attributed to a much steeper gradient in the temperature increase towards the cloud centre ( fig .",
    "[ fig : polydata ] ) . also , for a larger @xmath1 value , the molecular line peaks persist to larger projected radii away from the cloud centre ( see the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrapoly ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , these differences might not be readily distinguishable in observations , given the beam smearing in the spectral imaging observations and the presence of various noises in molecular line spectra .      in theoretical models of gravitational core collapsing clouds ,",
    "a static central dense kernel is introduced to avoid the singularity .",
    "phenomenologically , the radius of the kernel marks the interface of an ` embryo ' stellar kernel with the accreting gas in a gravitational free fall .",
    "this high - density kernel is more a theoretical hypothesis as was used in former works ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but it does fit the observed sub - millimeter intensity profile well ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the static high - density kernel could leave indelible signatures in molecular line profiles from the central core of a collapsing cloud . as the effective kernel opacity is large , molecular emissions from the far side ( i.e. behind the dense kernel ) would suffer strong absorptions at the rest - frame line - centre frequencies , depending on intrinsic line broadening @xmath55 .",
    "in contrast , molecular emissions from the near side ( i.e. in front of the dense kernel ) is unaffected by the kernel .",
    "this naturally leads to the suppression of the red wing of the blue line peak . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra4 ] , molecular line profiles manifest a dip feature in the red wing of the blue peak when the line - of - sight passes through the dense kernel . for rays along the lines - of - sight that avoid this central dense kernel",
    ", this dip feature would disappear ( see the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra4 ] as an example ) . fig .",
    "[ fig : centerspectra ] compares molecular line profiles from both models i ( @xmath3 ) and iii with and without a central kernel .",
    "the difference in molecular line profiles for the case with and without the dense static kernel are not negligible .",
    "moreover , the presence of a dip makes the red peak appearing broader than the blue peak .",
    "however , this difference in line profiles is similar to the difference caused by different values of @xmath1 in model i ( the left panel of fig.[fig : spectrapoly ] ) , as well as the difference between model i and model iii ( left panel of fig.[fig : spectra4 ] ) .",
    "so the actual cause of this phenomenon on profiles can only be solved after testing the temperature and density profiles of the cloud by some other means ( e.g. the millimetre continuum ) .",
    "potentially , such a line feature may be utilized to probe the ` embryo ' kernel surrounding a protostar in its development and evolution [ e.g. pre - protostellar cores ( ppcs ) with detectable dust continuum emission at millimetre and sub - millimetre wavelengths ] before the eventual emergence as a ` fully functional ' star of nuclear burning .",
    "however in reality , whether or not such dips may be unambiguously resolved in the observed line profiles from molecular globules is determined by a few factors .",
    "in particular , it depends on the spectral resolution actually achieved by observations .",
    "it is straightforward that self - similar solutions of model i combined with radiative transfer calculations ( appendix c ) can be applied to fit observed h@xmath0co 140  ghz line profiles .",
    "empirical estimates of physical variables at certain epochs are introduced for calibration and profiles of variables are derived from model i self - consistently .",
    "as an example of illustration , we specifically model the 140  ghz h@xmath0co emission line from the bok molecular globule b335 .",
    "we take the observed line profile from @xcite , where the line emission was extracted along the line - of - sight path towards the cloud centre .",
    "the collapsing core ( i.e. the infalling region around the centre ) radius is @xmath70 \" according to @xcite . by adopting an estimated distance of @xmath71  pc to the bok globule b335 @xcite ,",
    "this gives a radius of @xmath72  au for the infalling region . however , the uncertainty in this distance to b335 is fairly large ( see table 2 of tomita et al .",
    "1979 ) and this radius may vary by more than a factor of two .",
    "we take this radius to be @xmath73 au for the collapsing core in our model calculations for b335 cloud .    the same @xmath3 solution of model i as in fig .",
    "[ fig : dynamicdata ] is used to model the structure of molecular line formation region .",
    "the maximum infall velocity is taken to be @xmath74 at @xmath75  au and the radial receding displacement velocity @xmath76 of the entire b335 cloud is @xmath77 .",
    "the intrinsic width of the molecular line is @xmath78 , and the effective line - centre opacity is @xmath79 . we find that a dense static inner kernel is needed in order to produce line profiles similar to the observed profiles .",
    "the kernel radius is @xmath80  au and the mean particle number density in the kernel is @xmath81 .",
    "[ fig : spectra2 ] compares the observed line profile and the line profile produced by model i ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the good agreement between our model line profile and the observed line profile clearly shows the viability of the conventional polytropic hydrodynamic model and the applicability of our line - profile radiative transfer calculations .",
    "it is possible to derive the central point mass @xmath82 and the total enclosed mass contained within the central kernel region @xmath83 in model i used in the above data fitting . using the @xmath17 value ( see table [ table : dynamic ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : dynamicvariable ] ) and scaling relations ( [ scalingone ] ) and ( [ time ] ) in our dynamic model with self - similar transformation ( [ equ : varu ] ) , we obtain the value of central point mass @xmath84 , referred to as an estimate for the mass of the central protostar ; this estimate is about twice the value of @xcite and @xcite and is @xmath51 times larger than the mass value estimated by @xcite . when we use the reduced enclosed mass @xmath85 at the boundary of the central kernel , the dimensional enclosed mass contained within the kernel region is derived to be @xmath86 .",
    "estimates of all these masses are not sensitive to the kernel radius but are mainly affected by the variation in the infall radius .",
    "therefore , all these masses would have an uncertainty of a few times .",
    "it is also possible to derive the mass accretion rate in the periphery around the kernel , @xmath87 yr@xmath88 . in this case , the timescale of a protostar formation can then be estimated as @xmath89 yr , which is @xmath51 times the infall timescale estimated in model iii @xcite .",
    "we have investigated and analyzed effects of radial dynamical and thermal structures of an inside - out core collapsing cloud with spherical symmetry on forming molecular line profiles emitted from star - forming molecular clouds .",
    "a simple radiative transfer model employing a direct ray - tracing algorithm along the line of sight is constructed for computing h@xmath0co 140  ghz emission line profiles in order to compare with those actually observed in a star - forming cloud .",
    "we model the gravitational core collapse of a molecular cloud by the self - similar hydrodynamics of a conventional polytropic gas under self - gravity in a self - consistent manner ( model i ) .",
    "we emphasize that an _ isothermal _ inside - out collapse model ( model ii ) can not produce asymmetric molecular line profiles .",
    "in contrast , a variable radial temperature structure , which is crucial for determining asymmetric molecular line profiles , can be derived self - consistently together with the radial velocity and density structures in model i , which is different from the semi - empirical approach ( model iii ) .",
    "we explicitly demonstrate that model i can indeed produce asymmetric double - peaked line profiles with stronger blue peaks than red peaks as observed in many star - forming molecular globules .",
    "we assess the relative importance of effects due to line - centre opacities , intrinsic line widths and polytropic index @xmath1 in model i. our radiative transfer calculations further show that the presence of a dense static inner kernel around the centre of a core collapsing cloud gives a characteristic signature of a suppressed red wing of the blue line peak in the molecular line profile .",
    "we show an application to line profile observations by modelling the 140  ghz h@xmath0co emission line profile from the centre of the bok molecular globule b335 .",
    "we note that sensible fits to the h@xmath0co emission line profile of b335 requires a dense static kernel in addition to conditions of a polytropic core collapse model and an estimated line - of - sight receding speed of the entire molecular cloud .",
    "using model i and the molecular line profile fits , we could estimate the protostellar mass , the mass inside the static condensed kernel , the mass accretion rate just outside the kernel radius , and the time scale of the protostar formation .",

    "<S> the isothermal model can not produce observed asymmetric double - peak molecular line profiles . the conventional polytropic model , which gives flow velocity , mass density and temperature profiles self - consistently , can produce asymmetric double - peak line profiles for a core collapsing cloud . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the blue peak is stronger than the red peak , consistent with a broad class of molecular line profile observations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that line profiles are robust against variations in the polytropic index @xmath1 once the effective line - centre opacity @xmath2 is specified . </S>",
    "<S> the relative strengths of the blue and red peaks within a molecular line profile are determined by the cloud temperature gradient , but the emission at frequencies between the two line peaks is determined by detailed density and velocity profiles in the cloud core . in the presence of a static dense kernel at the centre of a collapsing cloud , strong internal absorption along the line - of - sight may occur , causing a suppression to the red wing of the blue line peak . </S>",
    "<S> if reliably resolved in frequency by observations , this signature may be potentially useful for probing the environs of an infant protostar . </S>",
    "<S> the conventional polytropic model can be utilized to produce molecular line - profile templates , for extracting dynamical information from line spectra of molecular globules undergoing a gravitational core collapse . </S>",
