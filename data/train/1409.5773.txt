    "in the last years , transformation acoustics has emerged as an interesting tool for designing devices able to manage sound propagation in novel ways  @xcite .",
    "recently , the authors of this contribution have proposed a new transformation approach to the design of acoustic metamaterials : analogue transformation acoustics ( ata )  @xcite .",
    "ata overcomes some problems that arise when applying transformational techniques to acoustics by using the transformation properties of an analogue model @xcite , instead of the 4d diffeomorphism invariance employed in transformation optics  @xcite ( and not valid for the acoustic equation ) .",
    "more specifically , starting from the well - known  @xcite formulation of the acoustic equation in terms of the perturbation of the velocity potential @xmath0 ( we use the notation @xmath1 and @xmath2 , with @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) @xmath6 \\\\ \\nonumber & + & \\nabla\\cdot\\left[\\rho_0\\nabla\\phi_1-\\rho_0 c_0^{-2}\\left(\\partial_t\\phi_1 + \\mathbf{v}_0\\cdot\\nabla\\phi_1 \\right)\\mathbf{v}_0\\right]=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are respectively the background or static mass density , speed of sound and velocity , one notes that this equation can be recast as @xmath10 which represents the motion of a scalar field in a space - time whose metric is defined as @xmath11 this possibility , which lays at the core of the so - called  analogue gravity \" paradigm , is also the cornerstone of ata .",
    "in particular , one applies the classic transformation technique developed for electromagnetism on the analogue model rather than on the corresponding initial acoustic equation ( containing the parameters of the virtual medium ) , and successively maps back the transformed analogue equation to the acoustic one in order to obtain the new ( meta-)medium that implements the desired transformation  @xcite .",
    "the relativistic analogue model ( [ dalembertian ] ) is constructed in such a way to encode the physical properties of the acoustic systems , but at the same time it is characterized in terms of tensorial equations in an abstract space - time .",
    "therefore , one can consider any space - time coordinate transformation compatible with the acoustic equation ( in the sense of being re - interpretable as a medium ) .",
    "for example , since eq . requires an isotropic medium , all the transformations we can consider are the ones that preserve isotropy .",
    "we will address this limitation of ata ( at least partially ) in the present work .",
    "let us remark that we use here the word analogue model in the opposite direction than usual in analogue gravity .",
    "the relativistic abstract system is here the analogue of the real physical system in the laboratory .    in refs .",
    ", ata has been applied with success to the design of a series of devices ( e.g. , time cloak , frequency shifter ) which are typical of electromagnetic systems and that were not workable in acoustics . in those works ,",
    "the advantages of ata over standard transformation acoustics ( sta ) become evident . for example",
    ", it was found that introducing a moving background was required to implement transformations mixing space and time .",
    "this feature can not be considered using simply the pressure wave equation commonly used in sta , because the introduction of a background velocity breaks the form - invariance of the pressure wave equation ( even under galilean coordinate transformations ) .",
    "therefore velocity potential transformations provide , via the ata technique , a more general way of building transformational devices .",
    "in addition , although purely spatial transformations can be worked with both equations , the prescriptions for the acoustic parameters returned by each equation are different , and the ones given by ata can be more suitable for the construction of real - world devices .    like in any other transformation approach ,",
    "also in the case of ata the prescribed acoustic parameters are smooth functions of the coordinates and show an anisotropic character . however , the actual construction process of acoustic devices relies on the use of natural materials which only provide a discrete set of isotropic acoustic properties .",
    "the problem then arises to connect the theoretical results of ata and the technological realization of the required acoustic media . to solve this problem",
    "we can resort to acoustic metamaterials or metafluids , i.e. , fluids made up of various materials with certain acoustic parameters ( usually homogeneous and isotropic ) , which under some given conditions display different effective parameters that depend on those of the constitutive materials and on their shapes  @xcite .",
    "one way to obtain these effective parameters is to use homogenization techniques  @xcite . in the case of periodic systems",
    "whose physics can be described by differential equations with oscillating coefficients , homogenization allows us to approximate the full equations with equivalent ones containing homogeneous coefficients .",
    "as far as acoustic metamaterials are concerned , these techniques have been widely used to homogenize the pressure wave equation  @xcite .",
    "it is then reasonable to expect that the same approach can be used to achieve a better link between the ata prescriptions and real systems .    in this contribution , we address specifically such connection . in section  [ sec : homogenization ] , we describe the application of a two - scale homogenization technique to the velocity potential wave equation and present several examples .",
    "surprisingly , we find that the resulting effective parameters are different from those arising from the homogenized pressure equation . in section  [ sec",
    ": analysis ] we analyze the origin of this behavior .",
    "our analysis reveals new interesting insights on the way in which the velocity potential equation ( and thus ata ) works , as well as an alternative way to construct metafluids based on gradients of the static pressure .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : cloaking ] we use the results of section  [ sec : homogenization ] to design a device able to cloak the acoustic velocity potential .",
    "some conclusions are drawn in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "our initial goal is to homogenize the velocity potential equation . for simplicity",
    ", we will start by considering a non - moving background ( @xmath12 ) , for which eq",
    ".   reads  @xcite @xmath13 with @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "in addition , we would like to compare the resulting effective parameters with the ones arising from the homogenization of the pressure wave equation , which are usually considered in the construction of acoustic metamaterials .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) also represents the pressure wave equation if we take @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and replace @xmath0 by the acoustic pressure @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "we will assume that the composite to be homogenized is periodic in such a way that @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a diagonal matrix with @xmath22 an integer number and @xmath23 is a constant vector that determines the periodicity in each cartesian direction .",
    "moreover , we will assume that the coefficients @xmath24 satisfy the ellipticity condition @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) for all @xmath27 .",
    "under such conditions , using a two - scale homogenization approach it can be proven that , in the long wavelength limit , eq .  ( [ eq1 ] ) is equivalent to the following one ( see appendix  [ appendix_1 ] ) @xmath28 with constant coefficients given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 represents spatial averaging over the unit cell and where the functions @xmath31 are also @xmath32-periodic and satisfy the so - called cell problem @xmath33 as a consequence , we can define the following effective anisotropic densities for the homogenized velocity potential and pressure equations , @xmath34 eq .",
    "is the usual definition employed in the literature .",
    "note that , although we have considered a simplified problem with a non - moving background , the appearance of an effective anisotropic density in the homogenized @xmath35-equation already enables us to extend ata to anisotropic spatial transformations of the velocity potential ( which are physically different from transformations of the pressure  @xcite ) .",
    "however , there is an issue that deserves further attention ; the effective densities arising from the homogenization of the @xmath35-equation and the @xmath36-equation might be different , as deduced from eqs .   and  .",
    "a similar conclusion can be drawn about the effective speeds of sound .",
    "as an example , let us consider the homogenization of a two - dimensional ( three - dimensional ) periodic array of cylinders ( spheres ) of radius @xmath37 , with constant background parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 embedded in a fluid with parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 . since the resulting effective media will be isotropic , we can also define the following effective speeds of sound @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "specifically , let us study a common configuration in which the cylinders ( spheres ) are made of wood and the surrounding medium is air  @xcite .",
    "thus , we can take @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "we calculated the corresponding effective parameters by solving numerically eqs .  - in comsol multiphysics .",
    "note that the derivative on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "is not defined at the interface between both media . to deal with this situation",
    "we solve the corresponding equation at each uniform domain and apply the proper boundary condition at the discontinuity  @xcite . to derive the natural boundary condition associated with eq .",
    ", particularized for the case @xmath47 , it is wise to express this equation as @xmath48 then , the use of the divergence theorem readily leads us to the following boundary condition @xmath49 where the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to each of the two media(@xmath50 and @xmath51 are the values of @xmath52 at medium 1 and 2 , respectively ) , @xmath53 are the basis vectors in cartesian coordinates , and @xmath54 denotes the unit normal to the boundary between both media , pointing from medium 1 to medium 2 .",
    "the results for the previous example are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    ) of wood inclusions",
    "embedded in air as a function of the wood filling fraction @xmath55 ( @xmath56 for infinite cylinders and @xmath57 for spheres , @xmath37 being the radius ) .",
    "( a ) effective density and ( b ) speed of sound of a 2d array of cylinders .",
    "the speed of sound is calculated using two different methods ( homogenization and simulation of a finite array ) .",
    "( c ) effective density and ( d ) speed of sound of a 3d array of spheres.,width=302 ]    in the case of the cylinders , the effective density associated with the homogenized @xmath35 and @xmath36 equations is the same .",
    "this should be the expected behavior since , in principle , both quantities represent the same physical system ( a system described by the same underlying density and sound speed ) . as a double - check",
    ", we also plot the function @xmath58 which is known to provide a very good approximation for the effective density in this kind of system for low filling fractions  @xcite . however , the effective speeds of sound found after the homogenization of each equation are different [ see fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ] .",
    "we further verified these results by simulating a finite array of wood cylinders in comsol for each considered 2d configuration . from the simulation we can retrieve the effective speed of sound inside the finite array , which is in excellent agreement with that predicted by the homogenization process .",
    "the velocity potential for one of the simulated finite - array configurations is depicted in fig .",
    "in addition , we plot the function @xmath59 in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , a good approximation for the effective speed of sound at low filling fractions .",
    "remarkably , the values of @xmath60 arising from this approximation only coincide with those associated with the homogenization of the pressure wave equation .    in the 3d case ( wood spheres in air ) , neither the homogenized densities nor the sound speeds coincide [ see fig .",
    "[ fig1](c)-(d ) ] . again , only @xmath61 agrees with the prediction for low filling fractions , given in this case by @xmath62 .",
    "clearly , these results must imply that a certain distribution of acoustic parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 represents a different physical system depending on whether it is used in the @xmath35-equation or in the @xmath36-equation . in section  [ sec :",
    "analysis ] we look for an explanation to this behavior .        to conclude this section , we briefly analyze a simple yet useful example that we will employ in the construction of a velocity potential cloak .",
    "it is that in which the medium only varies in one direction , i.e. , @xmath63 ( @xmath52 being @xmath64-periodic ) . in this case",
    ", it can be shown that ( see appendix ) @xmath65 for instance , a periodic multilayer structure made up of two different homogeneous materials falls within the class of systems described by eq .  .",
    "specifically , if the two materials are characterized by parameters @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and the thickness of the layers of each material is @xmath70 and @xmath71 , then @xmath72 again , the effective parameters arising from the homogenization of the @xmath36-equation for this one - dimensional example are different from their homogenized @xmath35-equation counterparts . in particular , @xmath73",
    "both the @xmath36 and @xmath35 equations are derived from the basic principles of fluid mechanics , which , in the absence of mass sources and external forces are described by the equations  @xcite @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the entropy .",
    "these equations are to be supplemented with the equation of state of the medium , which for the barotropic case can be written as @xmath76 where @xmath77 is also a function of space and time .",
    "therefore , in order to find an answer to the above conundrum , we looked at the assumptions required to obtain the @xmath36 and @xmath35 equations from the previous ones .",
    "we will not include here the full derivation of the two equations ( the interested reader can consult refs .  ) , but only the steps required to understand the physical nature of the medium underlying each of them . in both cases , the first step is the linearization of eqs .  - .",
    "for that , we express all variables as a sum of a background ( subscript 0 ) and an acoustic ( subscript 1 ) contribution , i.e. , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 , with @xmath81 .",
    "substitution of these expressions into eqs",
    ".  - gives rise to a set of equations for the background and acoustic variables , from which the @xmath36 and @xmath35 equations are derived after imposing some additional conditions .",
    "specifically , to obtain the @xmath36-equation one must assume that the background or ambient fluid is isobaric  @xcite , i.e. ,    @xmath82    on the other hand , to obtain the @xmath35-equation , it is necessary to define an enthalpy function @xmath83 such that  @xcite ( see appendix  [ appendix_2 ] ) @xmath84 these relations are satisfied when @xmath83 is only a function of @xmath36 and the equation of state is of the form @xmath85 or , equivalently , @xmath86 then , the enthalpy can be expressed as @xmath87 we refer to the class of media described by eq .   as _ globally barotropic _ , which are a subset of the more general",
    "_ locally barotropic _ media described by eq .  .",
    "we can infer more information about the physical systems underlying the @xmath36 and @xmath35 equations from the equation of state .",
    "in particular , it can be shown that , taking the gradient of eq .   and",
    "linearizing , the corresponding equation for the background reads @xmath88 thus , the @xmath36-equation implicitly requires that @xmath89 while for the @xmath35-equation we have @xmath90 as a result , in the case of the @xmath36-equation , inhomogeneities in the acoustic parameters are only allowed if they come from having different media at each point ( all of them at the same background pressure ) .",
    "this is the usual configuration employed in the construction of metamaterials  @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of the @xmath35-equation , we must have the same medium everywhere , although the acoustic parameters may vary from point to point as a consequence of a background pressure gradient .",
    "therefore , although the values of @xmath40 and @xmath38 , and @xmath41 and @xmath39 in the examples analyzed in section  [ sec : homogenization ] are the same in both cases , they represent two entirely different physical systems depending on the considered equation .",
    "the situation is outlined in fig .",
    "this explains the results of section  [ sec : homogenization ] ; the considered acoustic parameters represent the wood - air system only when plugged into the @xmath36-equation , while they represent a fluid subjected to a certain pressure distribution when plugged into the @xmath35-equation .",
    "-equation ) .",
    "( b ) two different materials at the same static pressure ( this kind of system is modeled through the @xmath36-equation).,width=302 ]    since only ata allows us to work with moving background fluids or implement space - time transformations , the above results are crucial for the understanding of which type of physical systems can actually implement atas prescriptions .",
    "only the inhomogeneities arising from pressure gradients are permitted by the @xmath35-equation around which ata revolves .",
    "thus , conventional isobaric composites do not qualify for constructing general space - time transformation media with this method .",
    "in addition , forcing background pressure gradients in a homogeneous material constitutes an alternative way of building metafluids with properties significantly different from those of isobaric ones . for instance , a remarkable difference that appears in the previous example is the possibility of obtaining supersonic speeds ( with respect to the background ) for relatively low filling fractions , a feature not displayed by the isobaric composite .",
    "although the actual attainment of a certain static pressure profile will not be addressed here , we would like to suggest two different potential ways of approaching this issue . the first one is based on the use of one or several pump waves with a much higher amplitude than the acoustic one , which could generate the desired background pressure distribution .",
    "the second possibility is related to the transmission of sound in fluids flowing within pipes , where the static pressure depends on the pipe transverse section by bernoulli s principle . in both scenarios , smooth gradients of the acoustic parameters",
    "could be achieved without the need for homogenization .",
    "nonetheless , it is worth pointing out that only the acoustic density can be varied by modifying the background pressure in an ideal gas , since its equation of state is defined by a linear relation . to be able to tailor the speed of sound as well",
    ", another more complex material has to be employed , such as the ones governed by polytropic processes .",
    "finally , we would like to clarify an additional subtlety that we found with respect to the definition of @xmath91 , where @xmath92 .",
    "this quantity is commonly taken as  @xcite @xmath93 a more general definition is given by the relation  @xcite @xmath94 both definitions are equivalent for globally barotropic fluids .",
    "however , in the locally barotropic case , only the second one remains valid , since it is easy to show that the use of eq .",
    "[ c_def ] no longer yields the standard pressure wave equation .",
    "using the results of section  [ sec : homogenization ] we can now design devices that implement any spatial transformation of the acoustic velocity potential . for this purpose , we express the @xmath35-equation that describes sound propagation in a virtual medium characterized by density @xmath95 and sound speed @xmath96 in arbitrary spatial coordinates @xmath97 @xmath98 under a purely spatial coordinate transformation @xmath99 , this equation becomes @xmath100 where @xmath101 , @xmath102 being the jacobian of the transformation . in order to mimic the distortion introduced by this transformation we consider a second ( real ) medium consisting of a microstructure characterized by the position - dependent parameters @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "as deduced above , sound waves satisfy eq .   in the long - wavelength regime .",
    "this equation can also be expressed in coordinates @xmath97 yielding @xmath105 where the coefficients @xmath106 are obtained via eq .  .",
    "note that this equation is still valid when @xmath106 has a slow spatial variation ( slow spatial variation of the microstructure properties ) .",
    "clearly , if we rename @xmath107 to @xmath97 in eq .  , then eqs .   and are formally identical if @xmath108      consider the following radial transformation in cylindrical coordinates  @xcite @xmath109 according to the previous results , the effective parameters required to implement this transformation are @xmath110 to implement these parameters , we consider a cylindrical multilayer structure made up of alternating low- and high - density materials characterized by parameters @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "note that a similar strategy was adopted in previous works on electromagnetic and thermal cloaking  @xcite .",
    "again , the length of each low- ( high- ) density layer is supposed to be @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) . to a good approximation",
    ", we can use the results of eqs .   and   to obtain the effective density of this structure by taking @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "following the procedure of ref .  , we simplify the design by setting the thickness of all layers to a fixed value @xmath113 and impose the following conditions @xmath114    , and @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the acoustic wavelength . in all simulations , the left boundary is defined as the source of the gaussian beam .",
    "the rest of the computational domain is terminated by pmls.,width=264 ]    as a result , we obtain @xmath117 for these values to be equal to those specified by eqs .  - , it is clear that @xmath118 to verify the functionality of the designed cloak we solved the velocity potential equation in comsol for different situations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "first , we simulated a gaussian beam propagating through air .",
    "if a high - density cylinder is placed in its way , there appear shadows and reflections .",
    "these effects are suppressed if the cylinder is surrounded by the designed multilayer . according to our previous analysis , note that the whole cloak should consist of a unique fluid , while the different densities and sound speeds required at each region ( layer ) should be obtained by forcing the corresponding background pressure .",
    "in addition , note that this cloak implements the transformation given by eq .   over the velocity potential .",
    "therefore , the pressure distribution inside the cloak is different from the one existing in a device designed to cloak the pressure , as the one in",
    ". nevertheless , both devices prevent the acoustic wave from entering the inner region , which is equally cloaked in the two cases .",
    "in this paper we have applied a homogenization process to the velocity potential acoustic wave equation .",
    "this allowed us to derive the actual laboratory realization of acoustic metamaterials exhibiting the effective properties prescribed by ata .",
    "as an example , we designed a multilayer structure able to cloak the acoustic velocity potential .",
    "in addition , the analysis of several examples revealed an important difference in the way in which the results of sta and ata should be implemented in a real device .",
    "in particular it appears clear that sta can be used only to design isobaric systems whereas ata can be used only to design globally barotropic ones . such conclusion depends critically on the assumptions on the thermodynamical properties of the fluid at the base of the derivation of the acoustic equations and it points towards new experimental approaches to the construction of acoustic metafluids .",
