    "observational results obtained by a variety of recent cosmic microwave background and large scale structure experiments have greatly improved our picture of the universe on the largest observable scales .",
    "these observations are consistent with a primordial spectrum of adiabatic , gaussian , scale - independent perturbations  @xcite .",
    "an attractive explanation is that these primordial perturbations in the early radiation - dominated era originate from quantum fluctuations in an earlier inflationary era where small scale vacuum fluctuations can be stretched up to arbitrarily large scales @xcite .",
    "although it is often assumed that primordial perturbations originate from adiabatic fluctuations of a slowly - rolling scalar field driving the inflationary expansion ( the inflaton ) , _ any _ light scalar field ( with effective mass less than the hubble scale ) will acquire an almost scale - invariant spectrum during an almost exponential expansion .",
    "whether or not these isocurvature fluctuations in non - inflaton fields produce a primordial curvature perturbation depends upon whether or not the local value of that scalar field subsequently affects the local radiation density @xcite .",
    "in the curvaton scenario @xcite a light , weakly coupled scalar field remains decoupled from the inflaton during inflation and remains decoupled after the end of inflation .",
    "once the hubble scale drops below the effective mass of the curvaton , the field oscillates and eventually decays .",
    "but if the decay is late enough then the density of the non - relativistic curvaton may have grown large enough to contribute significantly ( more than about 1% ) to the total energy density of the universe .",
    "then the local radiation density after curvaton decay depends upon the local value of the curvaton at the end of inflation and it is the initial isocurvature perturbation of the curvaton field that determines the primordial density perturbation .",
    "this scenario leads to new possibilities for building particle physics models of inflation @xcite and qualitatively different constraints upon the inflationary parameters @xcite .    in the conventional slow - roll inflaton scenario",
    "there is a remarkable simplification when calculating observational constraints : one can calculate the primordial perturbations directly in terms of the inflaton field fluctuations during inflation , independently of the detailed physics of the end of inflation , reheating and the subsequent radiation - dominated era .",
    "this is because the inflaton fluctuations describe _ adiabatic _ perturbations about the background homogeneous cosmology on large scales and one can define a conserved curvature perturbation @xmath0 directly from energy conservation @xcite .",
    "by contrast , fluctuations in the curvaton field describe _ non - adiabatic _ perturbations about the background cosmology and the total curvature perturbation @xmath0 is no longer conserved on large scales .",
    "the non - adiabatic nature of the initial perturbations leaves open the possibility of residual isocurvature perturbations and detectable non - gaussianity in the curvaton scenario @xcite .",
    "one can define individual curvature perturbations for the radiation and curvaton fluids that remain approximately conserved so long as the fluids can be assumed to be non - interacting @xcite .",
    "this has been used to derive an approximate calculation of the resulting primordial perturbations in the curvaton scenario in terms of the curvaton density at the decay time in what has been called the sudden - decay approximation @xcite .",
    "however an accurate calculation of the resulting primordial perturbations requires numerical solution of the perturbation equations .",
    "this was performed in @xcite for a two - fluid model where non - relativistic curvaton particles decay into radiation . in this paper",

    "the primordial perturbations that result from an initial curvaton perturbation can be characterised by a transfer coefficient that is a unique function of a single dimensionless parameter that specifies the initial density of the curvaton relative to the curvaton decay rate .",

    "both the curvature and isocurvature perturbation ( if any ) originate from initial curvaton perturbation and are thus completely correlated , independent of the physics of the curvaton decay . in the absence of any additional source for the isocurvature perturbations ,",
