    "definite evidences from recent experiments  @xcite have confirmed that the neutrinos are massive and mixed .",
    "part of the intrinsic neutrino properties , such as the neutrino mass hierarchy and the 1 - 3 mixing angle , however , remain undetermined .",
    "the need for a better knowledge of the neutrino physics has motivated plenty of phenomenological analyses on whether and how the unknown neutrino properties can be reliably probed with the next generation experiments involving neutrinos from both the astrophysical and the terrestrial sources  @xcite .",
    "the core - collapse supernovas represent a unique type of neutrino source in that they emit neutrinos of all three flavors with a characteristic energy range in a time scale distinct from that of the neutrinos emitted from the sun , the atmosphere , and the terrestrial sources .",
    "the rich physical content involved in the environment further makes the supernova an important platform for the study of neutrino properties .",
    "in particular , the neutrino burst from a supernova has long been considered as a promising tool for probing the undetermined neutrino parameters , despite the fact that the complexity arising from the unavoidable astrophysical uncertainties may result in ambiguity in the interpretation of the observed events .",
    "the standard msw formulation  @xcite suggests that as the supernova neutrinos propagate outward , the variation of density profile can have an impact on the resonant flavor conversion .",
    "one of the difficulties in probing the unknown neutrino properties with the supernova neutrinos arises from lack of knowledge to the matter density profile in a supernova . the inverse power - law density , @xmath2 , of the progenitor star is usually adopted in the literature as the density distribution through which the supernova neutrinos propagate outwards .",
    "however , whether the global density distribution @xmath3 with a fixed power can provide a justifiable connection between the dynamics of resonant flavor conversion and the expected neutrino events at the detectors remains uncertain .",
    "in addition , one may easily question the validity of this over - simplified model if , among others , the time - dependent matter distribution driven by the shock waves and the associated effects ( see , @xmath4 , ref .",
    "@xcite ) are considered .",
    "it is shown  @xcite that near the msw resonance , even a relatively small deviation of the power from @xmath5 could have a sizable impact on the interpretation of the neutrino parameters .",
    "furthermore , no evidence suggests that the density distributions near both the higher resonance and the lower resonance should be described by a similar density profile .",
    "another major source of astrophysical uncertainty in analyzing the supernova neutrinos would be the spectral parameters .",
    "distinct predictions to the average energy and the luminosity of neutrinos exist among models .",
    "thus , the possible impact due to the uncertain spectral parameters also needs to be addressed in an analysis .",
    "independent and variable power - law functions are assumed in this work as the matter profiles near the locations of msw resonance .",
    "in addition , physical observables derived from the expected neutrino events at a water cherenkov detector are proposed .",
    "it is the aim of this work to analyze the outcomes due to the uncertain density profile and the choice of spectral models , and to investigate whether and how the experimental observables would provide hints for the determination of the unknown neutrino parameters .",
    "the analysis is also extended to include the earth matter effect .",
    "this work is organized as follows .",
    "section ii summarizes the general features of the neutrino fluxes emitted by a core - collapse supernova and that of the relevant detection processes at a water cherenkov detector . in section iii , the variable power - law function is proposed to account for the possible uncertainty in the matter profile near the msw resonance . in addition",
    ", observables are constructed and examined .",
    "focus has been placed on whether and how these observables would resolve the various scenarios arising from the uncertainty in the matter profile , the possible neutrino mass hierarchies , and the undetermined mixing angle @xmath6 . in section iv",
    ", the general formulation is expanded to incorporate the regeneration effect due to the earth matter . in section",
    "v , the observables proposed in section iii are re - analyzed with the earth matter effect included .",
    "section vi is devoted to analyzing the impact due to the choice of spectral models .",
    "we then summarized this work in section vi .",
    "a core - collapse supernova emits neutrinos of all three flavors on a typical time scale of roughly ten seconds . within a factor of two ,",
    "the total luminosity is approximately equi - partitioned into each flavor .",
    "the mean energy of each neutrino flavor is determined by its interacting strength with matter .",
    "it is believed that the neutrino spectra are not exactly thermal ; they are usually modeled by the pinched fermi - dirac distributions .",
    "the flux of flavor @xmath7 reaching the earth surface can be written as @xmath8}+1},\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the luminosity of the neutrino flavor @xmath7 , @xmath10 is the distance to a supernova , @xmath11 is the effective temperature of @xmath7 inside the respective neutrinosphere , @xmath12 is the energy of @xmath7 , and @xmath13 is the pinching parameter .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 with the polylogarithm function @xmath16 defined as @xmath17 note that the temperature @xmath11 is related to the mean energy @xmath18 by @xmath19 as an illustration , the spectral parameters published by the lawrence livermore ( ll ) group  @xcite will be adopted in the analysis : @xmath20 with @xmath21 mev , and @xmath22 = 2.0 , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "the pinching parameters @xmath28 are assumed . as for the neutrino parameters , we choose @xmath29 ev@xmath30 , @xmath31 ev@xmath30 , and @xmath32 .",
    "note that the ongoing work by the garching group  @xcite predicts distinct neutrino fluxes and average energies from that of the ll group . the comparison will be performed and discussed in section vi .    in a water cherenkov detector , such as the super - kamiokonde ( see , @xmath4 ,  @xcite ) , the upgraded hyper - kamiokonde  @xcite , and other facilities that are under planning or construction  @xcite , the event rate induced by the isotropical inverse @xmath33-decay process @xmath34 dominates over that of other channels .",
    "in this analysis , the isotropical cc processes : @xmath35    @xmath36    and the highly directional events induced by @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) and @xmath39 scattering will also be included .",
    "the neutrinos would likely go through multiple flavor transitions in a supernova at distinct density scales . a single power - law function , @xmath2 or @xmath3 in general , is usually adopted in the literature as the density profile of the supernova matter .",
    "when the neutrinos travel through a complex environment such as the matter of a supernova , however , it would seem more plausible in an analysis to allow independent and variable local density profiles near the resonant locations .",
    "if the matter distribution is modeled as layers of matter along the path of neutrinos in a specific direction , a simple power - law function can be adopted as the local profile within a layer : @xmath40 where @xmath41 stands for the @xmath41-th layer , @xmath42 describes the matter profile within the @xmath41-th layer , and @xmath43 denotes the magnitude of the component @xmath42 . the density profile near the location of resonance",
    "can then be written as @xmath44 where the @xmath45-th layer stands for the resonance layer of the flavor conversion .",
    "note that in this approach the power can vary from layer to layer to account for the uncertainty of profile originating from various types of sources .",
    "the thickness of the layers , which do not take part in the formulation of this analysis , can be uneven and unrestricted , with the assumption that a specific power @xmath46 properly describes the density profile within a specific layer .",
    "furthermore , the variable power and thickness also allow the deviation of the matter density from spherical symmetry and the inhomogeneity of matter distribution along different directions .",
    "one may also employ functions of more than one polynomial term .",
    "the extra polynomial terms would provide more details about the density profile in a global scale .",
    "however , the trade - off is that they also introduce more undetermined coefficients for the extra terms .",
    "since one only concerns the local density profile near the msw layer , the detailed shape and variation of the density in a global scale would be unimportant , and the extra terms with their undetermined coefficients would become redundant in the analysis .",
    "thus , the power - law function with an adjustable @xmath46 would be suitable and much simpler for the analysis on how the variation of local density profile , rather that the global profile , would impact the msw resonance .    in the following ,",
    "one may simply focus on the density shapes of matter in the resonance layers : @xmath47 for the lower resonance , and @xmath48 for the higher resonance .",
    "the variation of @xmath49 and @xmath50 would be expected to alter the efficiency of neutrino flavor transition .    along this approach",
    ", the crossing probabilities at the resonance can be modified as @xmath51 where @xmath52 or @xmath53 , @xmath54 is the mixing angle , @xmath55 is the correction factor to a non - linear profile , and the adiabaticity parameter @xmath56 takes the form @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 is the fermi constant , @xmath60 is the neutrino energy , @xmath61 is the electron number per baryon , @xmath62 is the baryon mass , and the scale @xmath43 varies very weakly with @xmath10 over the range @xmath63 .",
    "note that @xmath64 , and that @xmath65 can be obtained directly from @xmath66 by replacing @xmath54 with @xmath67 .",
    "the probabilities that @xmath0 and @xmath68 survive the flavor conversion are given respectively by @xmath69    @xmath70    for the normal hierarchy , and    @xmath71    @xmath72    for the inverted hierarchy . eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pc ] ) and  ( [ eq : gamma ] ) imply that the variation of neutrino energy plays an insignificant role  @xcite , as compared to the variations of @xmath73 and the 1 - 3 mixing angle , in affecting the survival probabilities .",
    "in addition , the two extreme values of @xmath74 : @xmath75 ( non - adiabatic ) and @xmath76 ( adiabatic ) , are given by the conditions : @xmath75 if @xmath77 , and @xmath76 if @xmath78 , where the function @xmath79 relates @xmath50 and @xmath6 : @xmath80 furthermore , eqs .",

    "as summarized in table 1 , the variation of @xmath73 ( @xmath87 ) , the undetermined @xmath6 , and the possible mass hierarchies would lead to six distinct scenarios in terms of the survival probabilities . in the first row of table 1 ,",

    "the neutrino events may be categorized into isotropical ( eqs .",

    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "1(a ) that three groups of nearly degenerate spectra would form for the isotropical events : ( i , v ) , ( ii , iv ) , and ( iii , vi ) .",
    "thus , the isotropical events alone fail to provide all the needed clues for separating the six scenarios . on the other hand , while the directional event rates shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) amount to only a tiny fraction of the isotropical ones , they could provide the rest of the clues for lifting the above degeneracy . as a result , combining both the isotropical and the directional events is inevitable in the construction of feasible observables .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath68 fluxes arriving at the surface of earth , @xmath94 and @xmath95 , are related to the original ones , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , through the survival probabilities @xmath89 and @xmath90 for @xmath0 and @xmath68 , respectively : @xmath98 @xmath99 the expected total event number @xmath100 induced by the flavor @xmath7 at the detector is given by @xmath101 de,\\ ] ] where @xmath102 is the number of targets at the detector , @xmath10 is the distance to the supernova , and @xmath103 is the cross section for @xmath7 in a particular reaction channel @xmath104 .",

    "it should be pointed out , as mentioned earlier , that the earth matter effect is manifested by an oscillatory modulation on top of the neutrino spectra that would have been observed without the regeneration effect .",
    "practically , it would be very difficult , if not impossible , to extract from @xmath285 the information that is significantly different from that obtained by @xmath286 .",
    "the ratio of the isotropical events to the directional events , @xmath287 , and the ratio formed by the average energy of the isotropical to that of the directional events , @xmath288 , are shown in fig . 5 and fig . 6 , respectively .",

    "we have shown how the original neutrino fluxes would be modified by the msw effect in a supernova even if the details of the density gradient of matter are unavailable .",
    "the input spectral parameters are adopted from the ll model . as compared to the ll model , the parameters predicted by the ongoing work of the garching group  @xcite , labeled as g1 and g2 , suggest smaller differences in both the flux and in the average energy among neutrinos of different flavors :    g1 : @xmath292 mev , @xmath21 mev , @xmath293 mev , @xmath294 ,    g2 : @xmath292 mev , @xmath21 mev , @xmath295 mev , @xmath296 .    to examine the impact due to the choice of models , the expected neutrino spectra for the six possible scenarios using the parameters of g1 and g2",

    "it is seen that the peak locations of the isopropical events for iii and vi mark the most significant difference between g1 and g2 .",
    "the peak locations for other scenarios are relatively insensitive to the choice of g1 or g2 . as for the directional events , the six scenarios are barely distinguishable under the g1 model . in general",
    ", the g2 model predicts directional spectra that are sharper than that predicted by the g1 model .",
    "the inherent complexity that leads to the entanglement in the spectral shapes , the peak heights , and the peak locations among scenarios and models may render a thorough , quantitative analysis very difficult .",
    "however , as can be seen from figs .",
    "7 and 8 , the most significant difference among scenarios for a given model appears in the spectra near the peaks .",
    "thus , the observed @xmath252 and @xmath289 might be able to reflect the distinct characters of each model .",

    "9 suggests that if the spectral parameters of g1 are adopted , the six different scenarios may still cause @xmath252 to vary by roughly a factor of two . on the other hand for g2",
    ", the ratio @xmath297 appears to be insensitive to the uncertainties represented by the distinct scenarios at small incident angle . as a comparison",
    ", one recalls from fig .",
    "3 that the possible values of @xmath297 for the ll model varies from @xmath304 to @xmath305 , which is in a region very different from that for g1 and g2 .",
    "we conclude that the observable @xmath252 would reflect the distinct characters of the three different model .",
    "the ratio @xmath306 can be analyzed in a similar way .",
    "we show the plots of @xmath306 for g1 and g2 in fig .",
    "it is clear that the values of @xmath289 predicted by the three different models fall in distinct regions : @xmath307 for ll , @xmath308 for g1 , and @xmath309 for g2 .",
    "in addition , it should be pointed out that we also perform calculations on the other ratios , @xmath285 , @xmath290 , and @xmath291 , using the input parameters predicted by g1 and g2 . however , unlike @xmath252 and @xmath289 , the results show that the expected values for each of these ratios would all tangled up unless either a particular model is specified or the uncertainty due to the density profile can be significantly reduced .    in summary ,",
    "the choice of models would lead to distinct signatures in the values of @xmath297 and @xmath306 .",
    "the degeneracy among the six scenarios for either ll or g1 could be removed . on the other hand ,",
    "the very nature of g2 would lead to only very little differences among the scenarios , @xmath88 , it would be difficult for them to be quantitatively distinguished .",
    "however , if the correct supernova parameters are the ones predicted by the g2 model , the analysis based on the g2 model could be relatively free from the disturbing uncertainties , such as that originating from the density profile , the mass hierarchy , and the mixing angle @xmath6 .",
    "while a satisfactory knowledge of the supernova mechanism is still far from complete , the neutrino flux emitted from the core - collapse supernova could be a promising tool for probing the unknown neutrino properties .",
    "it is the intention of this work to search for possible hints of the unknown neutrino properties using the experimental observables derived from the supernova neutrino signals .",
    "given the uncertain density profile and the choice of input spectral models , the aim is set to exploring the unknown neutrino parameters when the neutrino fluxes are modified by the msw resonant conversion in both the supernova and in crossing earth . although the msw mechanism has been well established in the literature , this analysis shows that the phenomenological outcomes due to the possible variation of density profile still provide certain new physical insight to the nature of the unknown neutrino properties .    in stead of following the traditional approach based on the global density profile @xmath2 , or the profile with a fixed power in general : @xmath3",
    ", this analysis allows the density profiles near the locations of resonance to vary independently as arbitrary power - law functions : @xmath47 for the lower resonance , and @xmath48 for the higher resonance .",
    "it is shown that the variation of @xmath73 ( @xmath310 or @xmath311 ) would cause different degrees of impact on the survival probability for @xmath0 ( @xmath68 ) according to whether @xmath91 or @xmath92 .",
    "as far as the survival probabilities are concerned , there exists six possible scenarios , which are characterized by possible combinations of the density profile , the mass hierarchy , and the mixing angle @xmath6 .",
    "we propose observable quantities that are derived from the expected supernova neutrino events at the water cherenkov detector , and explore the feasibility of probing the neutrino parameters with these observables . as an illustration ,",
    "the set of spectral parameters predicted by the lawrence livermore group ( ll ) is adopted . to investigate how the choice of supernova models would affect the outcomes ,",
    "the analysis based on the input parameters predicted by the graching model is also presented as a comparison .",
    "given the unknown density profile of the supernova and the choice of input spectral parameters , we show how the unknown mass hierarchy and the mixing angle @xmath6 would leave observable signatures on the neutrino events . the difficulties and limits for this type of analysis",
    "are also discussed .",
    "it is shown that the two observables , @xmath105 and @xmath125 , can combine to act as the most effective pair of observables for probing the neutrino parameters .",
    "other observables , @xmath286 , @xmath144 , and @xmath154 , may be considered as the supplementary references . a more realistic analysis incorporating the earth regeneration effect is also included .",
    "3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 show how each of the observables varies with the incident angle of neutrinos when the earth matter induces additional flavor conversion prior to the detection of neutrinos .",
    "the general formulation can be further expanded to accommodate different models of the earth density profile and can be applied to analyzing the effects if the neutrinos are registered by other types of terrestrial detectors .",
    "it should be pointed out that certain non - msw effects may occur in the complex environment of a supernova at different space and time scales .",
    "these effects may be independent of the density profile and may be totally irrelevant to the msw conversion . if the proper conditions are met , recent simulations suggest that effects such as the neutrino self coupling in dense media ( see , @xmath4 , ref .  @xcite and the references therein ) and the neutrino flavor de - polarization associated with the after shock turbulence ( see , @xmath4 , ref .",
    "@xcite and the references therein ) could occur .",
    "these effects are expected to impact the efficiency of neutrino flavor transition .",
    "it is suggested that both the shock reheating and the hot bubble epochs could provide the proper conditions for two classes of large - scale collective effects : synchronization and bipolar flavor transformation , which arose if neutrinos themselves form significant background .",
    "the neutrino flavor transformation due to this neutrino coupling effect shares no common origin with that due to the msw resonance .",
    "in addition , a fluctuating density in the post - shock region could be created by the turbulent convective motions behind the forward moving shock and the reverse shock .",
    "such fluctuations could erase part of the shock wave imprint on the neutrino spectra even with relatively small amplitudes .",
    "it is suggested that if the amplitude of density fluctuations in the turbulence is large , the average neutrino survival probability would saturate to 1/2 .",
    "the information about the initial state is then lost , and the final state is depolarized .",
    "this depolarization could leave unique signatures that are distinct from those left by the shock and other density effects .    as concluded by this work ,",
    "the variation of density profile , which plays a determinant role in the msw flavor transition , could modify the spectra significantly and lead to variation of the proposed observables by a factor of two or more . whether the flavor transition effect arising from one origin would dominate over that from the others depends on the spectral parameters , and on the neutrino intrinsic properties such as the mass hierarchy and the magnitude of @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , it also depends on the physical conditions that the neutrinos would encounter at different stages of the supernova environment and in crossing the earth matter .",
    "given the undetermined neutrino intrinsic properties and the existing astrophysical uncertainties , it would be intriguing to further investigate , under all possible and relevant physical conditions , how the non - msw effects would act as a modification to the msw effect or even dominate over the msw effect . the more detailed analyses with reduced assumptions would certainly help suggest how some of the existing msw - based paradigms for the neutrino flavor conversion in a supernova should be reconstructed .    this work is supported in part by the national science council of taiwan .",
