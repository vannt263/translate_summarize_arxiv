    "the problem of the electromagnetic ( qed ) gauge invariance in the deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) and similar exclusive processes has intensively been discussed during the last few years ( for example , see @xcite ) .",
    "this development explored the similarity with the earlier studied inclusive spin - dependent processes @xcite .",
    "the gauge invariance of hard process amplitudes is ensured by twist three contributions and by the use of the equations of motion that provide a possibility to exclude the three - particle ( quark - gluon ) correlators from the amplitude . so that , after combining with the two - particle correlator contributions , one gets the gauge invariant expressions for the physical amplitudes or , in the case of lepton - hadron processes , for the corresponding hadron tensors @xcite .",
    "this scheme was originally developed in the case of the particular inclusive processes with transverse polarized hadrons , like structure function @xmath1 in dis @xcite and single spin asymmetry ( ssa ) @xcite due to the soft quark ( fermionic poles @xcite ) .    also , the qcd gauge invariance of the so - called gluonic poles contributions @xcite has been a subject of studies in @xcite where the methods that are used rely on the wilson exponentials @xcite .",
    "we have shown in our recent work @xcite that , in order to ensure the qed gauge invariance of the transverse polarized drell - yan ( dy ) hadron tensor , it is mandatory to include the contribution from the extra diagram originating from the non - trivial imaginary part of the corresponding twist-@xmath0 function @xmath2 . before this study @xcite ,",
    "the function @xmath2 has been argued as real , and the imaginary part of amplitude was ensured by means of a specially introduced `` propagator '' in the hard part of the hadron tensor @xcite .",
    "however , we have explained in @xcite that the @xmath3-function does , in fact , have an imaginary part , and the existence of this imaginary part can be realized with a help of the contour gauge .",
    "moreover , the @xmath3-function with the complex prescription induces a new contribution to the hadron tensor .",
    "as has been stressed , this extra contribution leads to the amplification of corresponding tensor by a factor of @xmath4 .",
    "this finding of ours has independently been confirmed in @xcite by using of a different approach .    besides",
    ", from the point of view of phenomenology , the corresponding ssas in the dy process and the role of gluon pole contributions have previously been discussed in @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we extend our approach used in @xcite to the case of the direct photon production in two hadron collision where one hadron is transversely polarized .",
    "we derive the hadron tensor for this process and study the effects which lead to the soft breaking of factorization ( or the universality breaking ) through the qed and qcd gauge invariance . in a similar manner as in @xcite , the special role is played by the contour gauge for gluon fields .",
    "we demonstrate that the prescriptions for the gluonic poles in the twist @xmath0 correlators are dictated by the prescriptions in the corresponding hard parts .",
    "we argue that the prescriptions in the gluonic pole contributions differ from each other depending upon the initial or final state interactions of the diagrams under consideration .",
    "moreover , the different prescriptions are needed to ensure the qcd gauge invariance .",
    "we treat this situation as a breaking of the universality condition resulting in factorization soft breaking .",
    "the extra diagram contributions , which naively do not have an imaginary phase , is discussed in detail .    in the paper",
    ", we also show that the new (  non - standard \" ) terms do contribute to the hadron tensor exactly as the  standard \" terms known previously .",
    "this is exactly similar to the case of drell - yan process studied in @xcite .",
    "for pedagogical reasons , we remind briefly our findings for the drell - yan ( dy ) process where one of hadrons possesses the transverse polarization , see @xcite for all details . as usual , the drell - yan process with the transversely polarized nucleon is defined as @xmath5 where the virtual photon producing the lepton pair ( @xmath6 ) has a large mass squared ( @xmath7 ) while the transverse momenta are small and integrated out .",
    "the dominant light - cone directions for the dy process ( fig .",
    "[ fig - dy ] ) are defined as @xmath8 and @xmath9 with the dimensionless light - cone vectors @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "since we deal with a large @xmath12 in the process under consideration , it is possible to apply the factorization theorem to get the corresponding hadron tensor factorized in the form of convolution : @xmath13 usually both the hard and soft parts in eqn .",
    "( [ fac - dy ] ) are independent of each other , uv- and ir - renormalizable . moreover ,",
    "various parton distributions which parametrize the soft part have to manifest the universality property .",
    "based on dy - process , it is convenient to study the role of twist @xmath0 by exploring of different kinds of asymmetries , for instance , the left - right asymmetry",
    ". this left - right asymmetry means the transverse momenta of the leptons are correlated with the direction @xmath14 where @xmath15 implies the transverse polarization vector of the nucleon and @xmath16 is a beam direction @xcite . generally speaking , any single spin asymmetries ( ssas )",
    "can be presented in the following symbolical form ( at this moment , the exact expression for ssa is irrelevant ) : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is an unpolarized leptonic tensor and , consequently , has only the real part ; @xmath19 stands for the hadronic tensor which is also real .",
    "since one of hadrons is transversely polarized , the corresponding matrix element which forms the soft part of hadron tensor reads @xcite @xmath20 where the light - cone vector @xmath21 is a dimensionful analog of vector @xmath22 .",

    "( [ g - pole - b ] ) . as a result ,",
    "the qed gauge invariance of the dy hadron tensor is in question . indeed , having analyzed the hard subprocess in the context of the qed gauge invariance , we can conclude that only the sum of two diagrams in fig .",

    "in fact , the representations ( [ phi1 ] ) and ( [ phi2 ] ) are _ not _ equivalent ones @xcite .",
    "to see that it is necessary to remember that all axial - type gauges are the particular cases of the most general contour gauge ( see appendix [ contourgauge : app : a ] and the text below for details )",

    "in contrast to the dy - process , as we will see in the next section , the direct photon production tensor is built with the functions @xmath2 that will not manifest the universality",
    ".    we will refer to _ a soft breaking _ of factorization when the factorization procedure results in the mathematical convolution between the finite hard and soft parts , but there is no universality for the soft functions or the hard and soft parts are not totally independent .    to conclude this section ,",
    "let us note that the situation with the gauge invariance for the dy - process ( [ dy - illust ] ) is very similar to what has been discussed for the vector meson electroproduction in @xcite where the final state interaction also predetermined the correct prescription for the spurious gluon pole for the validity of qcd factorization .",

    "the factorization procedure contains the following steps :    * the decomposition of loop integration momenta around the corresponding dominant direction : @xmath71 within the certain light cone basis formed by the vectors @xmath72 and @xmath22 ( in our case , @xmath73 and @xmath22 ) ; * the replacement : @xmath74 that introduces the fractions with the appropriated spectral properties ; * the decomposition of the corresponding propagator products around the dominant direction : @xmath75 * the use of the collinear ward identity , if it requests by the needed approximation : @xmath76 * performing of the fierz decomposition for @xmath77 in the corresponding space up to the needed projections .",

    "the solution of the qed gauge invariance problem for the dy hadron tensor can be found by using the contour gauge conception ( see , for example , @xcite ) . here",
    ", we would like to demonstrate that there is no an ambiguity in the integral representation of the gluon fields through the strength tensor ( eqns .",
    "( [ ag1 ] ) and ( [ ag2 ] ) ) .",
    "it is important to note that the axial gauge condition , @xmath34 , ( as well as the fock - schwinger gauges ) is actually a particular case of the most general contour gauge where the wilson line with an arbitrary path determines the gauge transformations .",
    "the contour gauge was the subject of very intense studies many years ago .",
    "the preponderances of the use of the contour gauge is that the quantum gauge theory becomes free from the gribov ambiguities .",
    "let us briefly discuss the main items of the contour gauge conception . to describe this class of gauges ,",
    "it is instructive to assume the geometrical interpretation of gluons where the gluon field is a connection of the principal fiber bundle @xmath143 ( here , @xmath144 implies the base where the principal fiber bundle is determined , @xmath145 denotes the group defined on the given fiber and @xmath146 is a transformation of the base @xmath144 into the fiber bundle @xmath147 ) .",
    "each element @xmath148 of the fiber , with the help of the gluon field @xmath149 , defines the gauge - transformed field : @xmath150 the set of these fields for all @xmath148 forms the orbit of the gauge - equivalent fields .",
    "it is well - known that in order to quantize the system of the gauge fields , one has to choose the only element of each orbit .",
    "in contrast to the usual way , we first fix an arbitrary point @xmath151 . ] in the fiber .",
    "then , we define two directions : one of them in the base , the other in the fiber .",
    "the direction in the base @xmath144 is nothing else than the tangent vector of a curve which goes through the given point @xmath152 . at the same time",
    ", the direction in the fiber can be uniquely determined as the tangent subspace which is related to the parallel transition . after following this procedure",
    ", one can uniquely define the point in the fiber bundle .",
    "further , solving the parallel transport equation which is defined on the fiber as @xmath153 one can find the solution in terms of the wilson line : @xmath154 where the points @xmath152 and @xmath155 are connected by the path @xmath156 .",
    "the starting point @xmath152 is usually fixed , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath152 is independent on @xmath155 . here",

    "note that the fixing of @xmath148 ensures a unique choice of the element in the orbit . inserting ( [ gg ] ) into ( [ ag ] )",
    ", one can see that the field @xmath158 is completely determined by the form of the path which connects the starting and final points .",
    "moreover , using ( [ ag ] ) and ( [ gg ] ) , one obtains the property : @xmath159 * inserting * eqn .",
    "( [ gg ] ) into eqn.([ag ] ) ( we remind that the point @xmath152 is fixed ) , we arrive at @xmath160 where @xmath161 the contour gauge condition demands that @xmath148 is equal to unity for all @xmath155 belonging to the base , _",

    "i.e. _ the gluon field @xmath163 is a linear functional of the tensor @xmath165 .",
    "let us * briefly * comment a choice of the boundary conditions for gluons . as is pointed out in @xcite , the starting point @xmath152 of the path @xmath166 ( see , ( [ cg3 ] ) ) is not well defined by construction . in turn",
    ", this leads to the presence of the so - called residual gauge transformation . to avoid this ambiguity ,",
    "it is natural to fix the uncertainty in eqn .",
    "( [ cg3 ] ) by @xmath167 . in other words ,",
    "the starting point is fixed , and it is independent from the destination of the path @xmath166 .",
    "it is easy to see that the representations ( [ ag1 ] ) and ( [ ag2 ] ) ( or the representations ( [ phi1 ] ) and ( [ phi2 ] ) ) can be derived from ( [ cg3 ] ) by fixing of the path @xmath168 as a straight line connecting the point @xmath155 with @xmath169 , respectively . in fact , it means that the representations ( [ phi1 ] ) and ( [ phi2 ] ) correspond to two different contour gauges and give us two different representations for two different functions @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "these two representations are associated with the final and initial state interactions ( eqns.([b - fsi ] ) and ( [ b - isi ] ) ) .    moreover , in order to get a concrete representation for gluons within the axial gauge , we can explicitly parametrize the straight line between the points @xmath155 and @xmath172 along the  minus \" light - cone direction @xmath173 : @xmath174 then , using eqn .",

    "note that the functions @xmath115 do not possess a certain property under the time - reversal transformation .",
    "this property becomes a well - defined one only after calculation of the imaginary part for the hadron tensor .",
