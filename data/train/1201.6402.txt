    "the semi - empirical relationship  @xcite @xmath0 has been used to motivate `` greener''magnetic hdd designs  @xcite . of the three variables that can used to match a given power constraint , diameter and rpm ( _ revolutions per minute _ ) have the greatest impact due to the high degree of their respective positive exponents ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dkplots ] ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that is not a function of capacity ( e.g. , gb ) ; the typical metric used for storage capacity planning .",
    "the hdds used in laptops are designed to operate in the energy - limited environment of a battery - powered system .",
    "consequently , those disks tend to be smaller , slower , and have fewer platters .",
    "server hdds , on the other hand , tend to follow the converse trend .",
    "since the rpm can be varied dynamically ( drpm )  @xcite , disk drive manufacturers now offer this capability in some models  @xcite .",
    "for the purposes of comparing the power consumption of two hdd models ( say , _ a _ and _ b _ ) it is more convenient to express in the _ ratio form _",
    "@xmath1 which avoids the necessity of otherwise determining a constant of proportionality .    in this simpler notation , @xmath2 is the power consumed ( watts ) , @xmath3 is the number of platters per spindle , @xmath4 is the angular speed ( rpm ) , and @xmath5 is the platter diameter ( not the external form factor ) usually expressed in _ inches _ in u.s .",
    "vendor data sheets .",
    "another convenience of using is that the ratio of two hdd parameters that are common ( e.g. , the same diameter ) simplifies to unit value .",
    "[ exam : rpm ] the parameters in the following table are for hdds with a single platter @xmath6 and the same diameter @xmath7 inches  @xcite .",
    "rrrr|r + @xmath8 & @xmath9 & @xmath10 & @xmath11 & + 0.91 & 1.13 & 15,098 & 16,263 & 1.121 + 2 & 35.55 & 19,972 & 55,819 & 35.550 + 35.55 & 499.73 & 55,819 & 143,470 & 499.782 +    hence , only the ratio of the angular speeds contributes in to the estimated power @xmath12 in the last column .",
    "because the exponents in are relatively large , the functions of rpm and diameter are highly nonlinear and that means :    * potentially large energy savings can be achieved even within a limited selection of hdd models , especially when taken in aggregate across sans , nas , jbods , or raid storage configurations .",
    "* the key disk parameters are available from vendor data sheets , although some caveats still apply  @xcite .",
    "the data used in this example are taken from tables 3.33.5 in  [ exam : rpm ] .",
    "the effect of reducing hdd diameter ( @xmath13 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dkplot3d ] .    at highest rpm ,",
    "both the @xmath14 inch and @xmath15 inch hdds are located higher on the power hill than the @xmath16 inch hdd .",
    "we now turn to providing a theoretical justification for the semi - empirical relationship in . as a starting point",
    ", we assume :    1 .",
    "the empirical exponents can be associated with integers ( rounded up ) 2 .",
    "planer rotation of the platter imposes axial symmetry 3 .",
    "rotational friction is present since the platter is not _ in vacuo _",
    "a thin rotating platter implies that inertial linear relationships , like the kinetic energy alone , can not produce .",
    "rather , rotational quantities , like moments of inertia , are more important .",
    "rotation also implies that there is aerodynamic friction due to the platter spinning .",
    "this is also assumed to be greater than friction in the spindle bearings .",
    "since the hdd platter resides in a stationary housing , we assume there is no translational drag proportional the cross - sectional area of the platter ; as there would be for a fan - blade or propeller pulling air .      the http://www.princeton.edu/~asmits/bicycle_web/bernoulli.html [ bernoulli equation ] tells us that the pressure at some point in a fluid ( e.g. , air with density @xmath17 ) is given by : @xmath18 for the spinning disk , we are only interested in the dynamic contribution of the third term . the external and hydrostatic contributions can be ignored .",
    "since pressure is force per unit area ( @xmath19 ) , the aerodynamic frictional force will be @xmath20 where @xmath21 , the _ drag coefficient _ is an additional fudge factor that covers a multitude of sins as to how the fluid drag actually occurs .",
    "the drag force in is to be understood as being tangential , rather than centripetal .",
    "the velocity @xmath22 at any point on the platter surface has magnitude relative to the air in the tangential direction of the disk spin .",
    "similarly , the area @xmath23 is on the surface of the platter ( not its edge ) where the air literally drags .",
    "the roughness of the platter surface is captured in @xmath21 .      in its mechanical form",
    ", power is the rate of doing work ( @xmath24 ) or expending energy .",
    "@xmath25 for an hdd , however , it s probably more convenient to measure the energy loss due to aerodynamic friction in terms of the current drawn ( @xmath26 ) at voltage ( @xmath27 ) : @xmath28 if we count the charges @xmath29 as electrons , then @xmath30 is measured in electron - volts ( ev ) , which is a measure of energy . hence , and are dimensionally equivalent .",
    "moreover , the work performed in is by virtue of the friction force in acting along an elemental ( tangential ) arc length @xmath31 , i.e. , @xmath32 .",
    "hence , the power @xmath33 can be expressed directly in terms of the drag force and the tangential velocity .",
    "however , each elemental area ( @xmath34 ) on the platter moves with a different tangential speed and therefore experiences a different force .",
    "thus , we have to integrate all possible patches over the whole platter .",
    "applying , the power integral can be written as : @xmath35 ignoring any proportionality constant .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : disksector ] the sectorial area on the platter can be written as the product of the arc delta ( @xmath31 ) and radial delta ( @xmath36 ) : @xmath37 similarly , the tangential velocity vector @xmath38 is related to the ( axial ) angular velocity @xmath39 by @xmath40 but , since all these vectors are orthogonal on the disk we can use the scalar form @xmath41 substituting and into produces the two - dimensional integral @xmath42 which yields @xmath43 with @xmath44 , is identical to up to constants of proportionality .",
    "the theoretical contributions to can be summarize in the following simple steps :    1 .",
    "factor the power @xmath2 as @xmath45 2 .",
    "@xmath46 comes from the total area of the platter 3 .",
    "@xmath47 is the angular speed @xmath22 of air at any point on the spinning platter 4 .",
    "why the cube : @xmath48 ? 5 .",
    "a factor @xmath49 comes from the bernoulli pressure ( @xmath19 ) in 6 .",
    "another @xmath22 factor comes from the definition of power @xmath50 in    a factor of @xmath51 should also included since the drag will occur on both the upper and lower side of the platter , but we are not keeping track of constants here .",
    "there could also be inter - platter turbulence but the reynold s number is likely already substantial due to head movement .",

    "<S> the electrical power consumed by typical magnetic hard disk drives ( hdd ) not only increases linearly with the number of spindles but , more significantly , it increases as very fast power - laws of speed ( rpm ) and diameter . since the theoretical basis for this relationship is neither well - known nor readily accessible in the literature , we show how these exponents arise from aerodynamic disk drag and discuss their import for green storage capacity planning . </S>"
