    "it means that vibrations in lsw have also normal component , which is shifted by phase @xmath102 with respect to vibrations along the surface .",

    "it decreases the storage time or transmission of the box .    for estimation of the effect one can consider some material like stainless steel with density @xmath103 g/@xmath104 , the speed of transverse waves @xmath105 km / s and @xmath106 , like that used in fig . [ quak ]",
    ". then ultrasound with @xmath107 mhz and amplitude @xmath108 , has energy density @xmath109 of the the order of 10 w/@xmath110 .",
    "the speed @xmath111 of the horizontal vibrations on the box floor surface at critical incidence angle will be near @xmath112 m / s .",
    "it will create vibrations of the vertical plates with the same speed .",
    "every collision of ucn with walls will increase in average their @xmath113 by @xmath114 m@xmath115/s@xmath115 .",
    "therefore , after 100 collisions with the walls their energy will be high enough to penetrate the walls and to escape from the storage box .",
    "the dependence of the storage time @xmath116 or transmission of the box on cosine of the grazing angle @xmath18 is expected to look as shown in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] .",
    "observation of the dip will prove the appearance of the lsw and therefore will prove the validity of the earthquake model .",
    "the theory of lsw is presented . though surface waves were studied extensively  @xcite the longitudinal one",
    "was discovered  @xcite only because of nonstandard approach to theory of elasticity .",
    "the lsw appears at reflection from a free surface of a shear wave with polarization in the incidence plane , when grazing angle of the incident wave is below of the critical one @xmath117 .",
    "below and near @xmath83 the energy density of lsw can be orders of magnitude higher than energy density of the incident wave . from the properties of lsw",
    "one can conclude that they can have the same devastating effect as earthquakes .",
    "therefore lsw can be considered as a model of earthquake waves .",
    "we described here an experiment , which can check the properties of lsw .",
    "it is related to storage or transmission of ucn . in the experiment",
