    "this concept can be distinguished from that of the `` passive '' mass measuring the response to a gravitational field and of an `` inertial '' mass describing resistance against acceleration by any force , gravitational or other .",
    "these distinctions are useful for considering non - newtonian or non - einsteinian theories of gravity , or to assess which aspects of mass are tested in experiments . in newton s and einstein s theories these distinctions are not necessary , in agreement with available physical and astronomical evidence and post - newtonian approximations .",

    "gauss had not been aware of george green s 1828 article `` an essay on the application of mathematical analysis on the theory of electricity and magnetism '' @xcite that had named @xmath0 the `` potential function '' .",
    "green had published his paper privately and had rarely referred to it in his later papers .",
    "it was only several years after green s death in 1841 that william thomson ( the later lord kelvin ) discovered green s paper and arranged for the publication of its results .",
    "the acceleration vector @xmath6 for a massive particle was given by lagrange in an inertial system by @xmath7    this law may be read as saying that the inertial mass may be identified with the passive gravitational mass .    in his 1782 `` theory of the attraction of spheroids and the figure of the earth '' @xcite pierre simon laplace introduced for the function @xmath0 the equation @xmath8    that is now named the laplace equation .",
    "laplace did not write it , as we just did , in cartesian coordinates @xmath9 but used spherical polar coordinates .",
    "he published the form in cartesian coordinates in his `` memoir about the theory of saturn s ring '' @xcite in 1787 .",
    "it was only 26 years later that simon - denis poisson pointed out in his `` remarks about an equation that occurs in the theory of attraction of spheroids '' that the laplace equation does not hold within the substance of the attracting body @xcite and has there to be replaced by @xmath10    this equation is now known as the poisson equation . a proof was first given by gauss in 1839 @xcite . if we write the equations in terms of the potential @xmath5 we have @xmath11    the relation between the gravitational potential and the density of the active mass in an inertial system of newton s theory .",

    "one is the factor @xmath32 on the right hand side of the equation . since the discovery of energy conservation the potential had been defined as the work to displace a unit mass ( charge ) from infinity and it was usually normalized to vanish at spatial infinity . in einstein",
    "s theory of gravitation the component @xmath40 for a finite mass distribution in a static gravitational field is usually taken as @xmath41 or 1 at infinity .",
    "the reason is that now one includes the rest energy of a particle as part of the potential energy and assumes that the metric of an isolated system becomes euclidean at large distances .",
    "we have then for @xmath32 at large distances @xmath42 from the center of mass @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the total active mass .",
    "thus , for weak fields the factor @xmath32 in the relativistic poisson equation differs from 1 only slightly .",
    "the most surprising correction to the relativistic poisson equation is the term @xmath45 that is actually @xmath46 .",
    "this term was first noted explicitly as a consequence of einstein s field equations by tullio levi - civit in 1917 in his series of papers on `` einstein s static '' @xcite .",
    "it is this term that we shall discuss in other sections of this paper . finally , @xmath47 in the formula for the active mass is the proper volume element .",
    "the justification for identifying @xmath32 with the relativistic global potential rests on its definition as the specific potential energy .",
    "we shall show in section  [ s : eps ] that the test particle of unit mass resting at @xmath48 has potential energy ( apart from its rest - energy ) @xmath49    the poisson equation in newtonian gravity is written down in a global inertial system .",
    "the closest analog to such a system for einstein s static gravitational fields ( without cosmological constant ) is based on the coordinates adapted to the time - like hypersurface - orthogonal killing vector .",
    "it also defines a rest system through the divergence - free time - like unit vectors orthogonal to the hypersurfaces t = const . reaching out to spatial infinity where the space - time metric is assumed to become minkowskian .",

    "this gives @xmath61    since tolman was particularly interested in the `` gravitational mass of disordered radiation , '' the @xmath45-term in the active mass density caught his attention .",
    "this was no longer one of the tiny effects of general relativity .",
    "tolman s observation led to the following paradox : while matter at rest in a spherical container of negligible matter might exhibit a total mass @xmath44 in the far field of the container , transformation of the mass inside the container into disordered radiation would then double the total mass violating the conservation of @xmath44 . after the discovery of the positron in 1932 and its annihilation with the electron such complete transformations of matter into radiation",
    "were no longer impossible .",
    "0    the authors of this paper were members of a seminar on relativity that regularly met at hamburg university in the 1950 s .",
    "when we learned about the @xmath45-term in the poisson equation the following test was suggested :    since nucleons move in atomic nuclei with about two tenths of the speed of light , the @xmath45-term might significantly contribute to the active mass density of all nuclei except hydrogen and the neutron .",
    "a simple calculation for the pressure in an ideal fermi gas of nucleons at zero temperature ( see section  [ s : b1 ] ) gave a pressure contribution to the active mass density of 4.3% for nuclear matter .",
    "a ball of hydrogen should , therefore , have an active mass about 4% smaller then a ball of lead of the same inertial and passive gravitational mass that could be checked by weighing them on scales .",
    "however , the only way such an effect might be seen in the laboratory was by the cavendish experiment for the determination of the gravitational constant where the active mass came into play . while it would be forbidding to work with a ball of ultra - cold solid hydrogen one might consider a material with a high hydrogen content that was solid at room temperature like polyethylene of formula @xmath62 or lithium hydride of formula @xmath63 .    for lithium hydride",
    "we have @xmath64    and for polyethylene @xmath65    if one were to use balls of these materials for a determination of the gravitational constant through the cavendish experiment one should thus get lower values for the gravitational constant @xmath4 . in the fifties",
    "the value of @xmath4 was uncertain by about 0.1% @xcite and so the effect might just be measurable .",
    "when one of us ( els ) talked in 1958 to robert dicke of princeton university about a possible experimental test dicke had his doubts whether it could be done since machining homogeneous spheres in those materials might be forbidding .",
    "however , a year later it became clear that there should be no different value for @xmath4 with balls of hydrogen .",
    "dieter brill from princeton who had joined the hamburg seminar alerted us to a paper in the physical review by charles misner and peter putnam @xcite about active mass ( about peter putnam who died in 1987 see john wheeler s memoir @xcite . )",
    "misner and putnam showed , assuming gravity to be negligible , that the 3p - term for a gas in a container was canceled by negative contributions to the mass from the stresses in the walls of the container that kept the gas together .",
    "it had not been clear to us that negative _ surface _ contributions to the energy would exactly cancel the positive _ 3p - volume _ contribution to the total mass when we had the model of a bubble in mind .",
    "0    we imagined a gas of constant density @xmath16 and pressure @xmath57 enclosed in a spherical two - dimensional shell of radius @xmath42 with surface mass density @xmath66 and surface tension @xmath67 .     is filled with a gas of pressure @xmath57 .",
    "the bubble is kept in equilibrium by a surface tension @xmath66 with dimension force by length . ]",
    "the surface tension should be just strong enough for keeping the bubble in equilibrium .",
    "the gravitational binding energy of the bubble was supposed to be negligible compared to its mass . for finding the relation of surface tension to pressure for equilibrium we imagined a plane cut through the bubble removing the southern hemisphere . to keep the northern hemisphere in equilibrium one now had to balance the upward pressure over the equatorial disc of area @xmath68 against the surface tension pulling down along the equator over the length @xmath69 .",

    "@xmath70    the total active mass @xmath44 would then be obtained by the surface contribution @xmath71 and by the volume contribution @xmath72 @xmath73    leaving us with half the volume contribution of the @xmath45-term to the active mass .",
    "something was wrong .",
    "it was only last summer in a nostalgic moment when we talked about this problem again that we saw the solution :    if the active mass density of a 3-dimensional distribution has to be complemented by a @xmath45-term , then that of a 2-dimensional shell needs a @xmath74-term and a 1-dimensional disk a @xmath57-term ( corresponding to the trace of a 2- or 1-dimensional isotropic stress tensor ) if they were stresses instead of pressures they would come in with a negative sign .",
    "now all was clear : the surface contribution to the active mass of the bubble was @xmath75 and we obtain now instead ( [ sb.2 ] ) @xmath76    this simple remark settled also the case of the active mass of a circular disk .",
    "0    we consider a circular disk of radius @xmath42 with mass density @xmath66 and pressure @xmath57     carries a surface pressure @xmath57 with dimension force / length .",

    "this gives @xmath80    the active mass @xmath44 of the disk is then obtained by taking the active mass density @xmath81 over the area @xmath68 and adding the active mass density @xmath82 of the bounding string along the circumference @xmath69 .",
    "this gives @xmath83    the promised result .",
    "0    in newtonian theory there was always the understanding , because of `` actio = reactio '' , that the active and passive masses were equal .",
    "if this were not the case a system of two passive unit masses but different active masses would show an acceleration of its center of mass violating newton s law _ actio = reactio_. in einstein s theory of gravitation the equality of active and passive",
    "mass is not so obvious since einstein s cosmological constant can be seen as giving rise to self - acceleration for the center of mass of a double star . while we have no reason to doubt the equality of the three kinds of masses we believe that tests involving the active mass are certainly desirable",
    "this is especially true for situations where the gravitational binding energy significantly contributes to the mass .    in general relativity",
