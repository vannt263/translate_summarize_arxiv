    "understanding the behavior of matter under extreme conditions of density and temperature , such as those found in neutron stars or in heavy - ion collisions , requires a good knowledge and control on the modification of the properties of hadrons in the nuclear medium .",
    "in particular , the in - medium effects on antikaons have received much attention over the last years , especially after the speculation of the possible existence of an antikaon condensed phase @xcite .",
    "empirical analysis of kaonic atoms @xcite predict a strong attractive @xmath4-nucleus potential , but , recently , the data have also been shown to be compatible with a potential which is four times less attractive @xcite .",
    "this last potential was obtained from a microscopic self - consistent calculation @xcite using the chiral non - perturbative model of ref.@xcite that reproduces the @xmath5 scattering observables .",
    "a recent fine - tuning of this potential @xcite , was shown to produce a @xmath6 as low as that of ref .",
    "these observations imply that the data on kaonic atoms , although giving a strong indication of attraction , do not really constrain the size of the @xmath4 optical potential at nuclear matter saturation density .",
    "the dynamics of the @xmath0 interaction is particularly rich due to the presence of an isospin 0 resonance , the @xmath7 , which lies only 27 mev below the @xmath5 threshold . as a result ,",
    "the isospin averaged @xmath5 interaction in free space is in fact repulsive .",
    "it was soon pointed out , however , that in the medium the pauli blocking on nucleon states moves the resonance to higher energies and makes the interaction attractive @xcite .",
    "this particular ( resonant - like ) energy dependence of the @xmath5 interaction at subthreshold energies requires an especially careful treatment of all in - medium effects .",
    "in fact , when the attraction felt by the antikaon is self - consistently incorporated in the calculation @xcite it compensates partly the effects induced by pauli blocking and the @xmath8 resonance gets broader and moves back to lower energies , around its free space location .",
    "moreover , since an extremely important ingredient to generate the @xmath8 resonance is the coupling of the @xmath5 system to the @xmath9 one , the modification of the pion properties was also included in ref .",
    "@xcite , with the result that the resonance width increased further more and the peak shifted upwards to an energy slightly above the free space one .",
    "heavy - ion collisions can also provide information on the modification of hadronic properties .",
    "in particular the enhanced @xmath10 ratio measured at gsi @xcite can also be understood assuming that the antikaons feel a strong attraction @xcite .",
    "this lowers the threshold for @xmath4 production , hence enhancing the ratio at subthreshold energies . in a recent work @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that the increase on this ratio could also be explained from the in - medium enhanced production of antikaons through @xmath11 hyperons due to the shifting of the @xmath7 resonance to higher energies , a mechanism that was already suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite to explain the data of @xmath4 absorption at rest on @xmath12c @xcite .",
    "the situation on the antikaon properties in the medium is , at present , far from being clear .",
    "although it is commonly accepted that to explain kaonic atom data and the results on heavy - ion collisions the @xmath4 must feel some attraction , the magnitude of it has not been really determined by the available observations .",
    "one may aim at extracting this information from theoretical models that have been well constrained in free space by the @xmath5 scattering observables . due to the special dynamics of the @xmath5 interaction ,",
    "these models must treat carefully all medium effects , as well as the energy and momentum dependences of the in - medium @xmath13 interaction .",
    "the momentum dependence of the @xmath1 optical potential is particularly important in the analysis of heavy - ion collisions since antikaons are created at a finite momentum of around @xmath14 mev / c .    intimately connected with the momentum dependence is the role of higher partial waves of the @xmath0 interaction . for a relative momentum of the @xmath5 pair as large",
    "as that explored in heavy - ion collisions , the importance of the higher partial waves , beyond the commonly considered @xmath2 component , might become quite relevant .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to study all these effects using the @xmath5 interaction of the jlich group @xcite , which is based on meson - exchange .",
    "the jlich potential predicts the @xmath7 resonance to be a quasibound @xmath5 state and reproduces satisfactorily the @xmath5 scattering observables .",
    "the matrix elements of this interaction depend on the incident and outgoing three - momenta , as well as on the total invariant center - of - mass energy .",
    "a partial wave decomposition is also given in ref .",
    "@xcite , hence allowing the investigation on how the different partial waves contribute to the @xmath1 optical potential in the nuclear medium .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",

    "in this section we present the formalism to obtain the self - energy or single - particle potential of a @xmath15 meson embedded in infinite symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "this self - energy accounts for the interaction of the @xmath15 with the nucleons and its calculation requires the knowledge of the in medium @xmath0 interaction , which we will describe by a @xmath16-matrix .",

    "we start this section by showing explicitly the most characteristic medium modification of the @xmath5 amplitude , which is obtained when the pauli blocking on the intermediate nucleons is incorporated .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the resulting in - medium @xmath5 amplitudes for a total momentum @xmath86 are shown in fig .",

    "we clearly see , as noticed already by all earlier microscopic calculations , the repulsive effect on the resonance produced by having moved the threshold of intermediate allowed @xmath5 states to higher energies , as a result of pauli blocking acting on the nucleon .",
    "clearly , this shift of the resonance changes the @xmath5 interaction at threshold ( @xmath91 mev ) from being repulsive in free space to being attractive in the medium .",
    "since this effect is intimately connected with the strong energy dependence of the @xmath5 interaction , important changes can be expected from a self - consistent incorporation of the @xmath1 properties on the @xmath5 @xmath16-matrix , as already noted by lutz @xcite and confirmed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this type of self - consistent calculations are also common in brueckner - hartree - fock studies of the @xmath45 interaction , where it is costumary to take the nucleon single - particle energies as real quantities .",
    "this amounts to disregard the imaginary part of the in medium @xmath45 amplitude in the calculation of the single - particle energy for nucleons above the fermi momentum .",

    "( [ eq : gmat1 ] ) is taken to be the real quasi - particle energy of eq .",
    "( [ eq : qp ] ) .    once self - consistency is achieved , we calculate both real and imaginary parts of the @xmath1 potential , which are displayed in fig .  [ fig : kaon2 ] as functions of the antikaon momentum , for normal nuclear matter density @xmath49 .",
    "we explicitly show the separate contribution of the various partial waves of the @xmath5 interaction . at zero momentum",
    "the real part of the @xmath1 potential is about @xmath92 mev and the partial waves higher than the @xmath2 component give a negligible contribution .",
    "both the real and imaginary parts of the potential show some structure between @xmath93 mev / c and @xmath94 mev / c .",
    "this is connected to the behavior of the in - medium @xmath5 amplitude which , in this simplified self - consistent scheme , still retains the resonant - like shape at @xmath49 .",
    "we observe that the high partial waves start being non - negligible for momenta larger than @xmath93 mev / c .",
    "it is interesting to focus our attention on the imaginary part of the @xmath1 potential which at low momentum is rather small .",
    "this is due to the supressed coupling to intermediate @xmath9 states as a result of the strong attraction felt by the antikaon combined with the attraction of around @xmath50 mev felt by the nucleon .",
    "the in - medium @xmath5 system then explores energies below those available for @xmath9 excitations and the antikaon width becomes extremely small . in this low momentum region",
    "the imaginary part of the @xmath1 potential is essentially due to the coupling to @xmath52 states in the relatively weak @xmath23 channel . as seen in the figure , for the @xmath9 channel to start giving a contribution to the imaginary part",
    ", it is necessary to provide the @xmath1 with a finite momentum ( around 200 mev / c ) , such that the condition @xmath95 mev can be fulfilled .    the substantial attraction obtained for the @xmath41 optical potential combined with the extremely small imaginary component of the @xmath1 optical potential might induce to think that the chances of producing very narrow , hence observable , deeply bound @xmath1-nucleus states are quite high .",
    "if these results were confirmed by more sofisticated treatments of the in - medium effects , an experimental search for these states should be indeed encouraged .",
    "however , as we will show in the following , the use of a more realistic self - consistent scheme wears this finding off .",
    "our second method consists of determining the complete complex @xmath3 single - particle energy given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : spen ] ) self - consistently .",
    "that means that the dressing of the @xmath1 in the intermediate states of the @xmath16-matrix equation is taken into account through a complex but energy - independent self - energy .",
    "this gives rise to the so - called `` quasi - particle '' spectral density , which has the energy dependence of a lorentzian distribution .",
    "although this is an approximation with respect to the more sophisticate attempts made in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the full energy dependence of the @xmath1 self - energy is self - consistently determined , it is sufficiently good for the studies we are carrying out in the present work .",
    "moreover , at the end of the self - consistent scheme , we evaluate the spectral density of the @xmath1 keeping the complete momentum and energy dependence of the @xmath1 self - energy .",
    "we first show , in fig .",
    "[ fig : kaon3 ] , the effect of dressing the antikaon with a complex self - energy on the in medium @xmath0 amplitude . comparing with the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kaon1 ] , we observe that the resonance peak stays now pretty close or even lower than its free space location .",
    "as mentioned above , this is due to the attraction felt by the @xmath1 that compensates the repulsive effect induced by pauli blocking on the nucleon .",
    "secondly , both real and imaginary parts of the @xmath5 amplitude become much smoother , as a result of the @xmath1 strength being spread out over energies .",
    "the resonance gets wider and dilutes much earlier with increasing density .",
    "we note that these effects are in total agreement with those obtained with the self - consistent approaches of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our results for the antikaon potential at @xmath49 obtained with this complete self - consistent scheme are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kaon4 ] .",
    "the real part of the @xmath1 potential at zero momentum increases to @xmath96 mev .",
    "it is worth noticing that the new scheme has produced a drastically different imaginary part .",
    "the small value of @xmath97 mev at zero momentum obtained using the simplified scheme turns out to be now around @xmath98 mev , hence making the observation of bound @xmath1 nuclear states more difficult .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the in - medium @xmath5 amplitude becomes smoother and wider when the @xmath1 energies are complex .",
    "since the @xmath1 spectral density develops a width and , in turn , the @xmath1 feels a reduced attraction , the @xmath5 states can couple more easily to the @xmath9 states than in the previous self - consistent scheme . from these results",
    "one must conclude that any approach claiming for narrow bound @xmath1 nuclear states must be looked at with caution , because the self - consistent scheme affects enormously the predicted @xmath1 properties in the medium .",
    "the effect of including the higher partial waves of the @xmath5 interaction is also seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : kaon4 ] .",
    "we observe that at zero @xmath1 momentum there is already some contribution of partial waves higher than @xmath2 due to the fact that the @xmath1 meson interacts with nucleons that occupy states up to the fermi momentum , giving rise to finite @xmath5 relative momenta of up to around 90 mev / c . clearly , the effect of the higher partial waves increases with increasing @xmath1 momentum , flattening out the real part of the optical potential and producing more structure to the imaginary part . at a @xmath1 momentum around 500 mev / c",
    ", the inclusion of higher partial waves makes the real part more attractive , from @xmath99 mev to @xmath100 mev , and practically doubles the size of the imaginary part .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : kaon5 ] we represent the real and the imaginary part of @xmath101 for different densities , obtained with the scheme that considers the complex potential for the antikaon .",
    "as we increase the density we obtain a more attractive potential due to two facts . on one hand , as discussed previously , the interaction is more attractive at higher densities . on the other hand , the @xmath15 feels the interaction of many more nucleons .",
    "the momentum dependence is moderate for the real part .",
    "in contrast , the imaginary part for densities around the saturation density and beyond shows more structure . this momentum dependence is smoother than that obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite from a phenomenological model using the information of the vacuum @xmath5 amplitudes , where the antikaon optical potential at normal nuclear matter density @xmath102 increases from @xmath103 mev at zero momentum to around @xmath104 mev at high momenta .",
    "starting from the self - consistent @xmath1 optical potential shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kaon3 ] and reproduced by the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : kaon5 ] , we perform two different tests in order to check some of the approximations used in the literature .",
    "first , we compute the optical potential neglecting the nucleon recoil corrections , as done in ref .  @xcite .",
    "this amounts to calculate the @xmath1 potential at momentum @xmath105 from a @xmath106 type expression , with @xmath16 being the in - medium @xmath5 interaction between a @xmath1 of momentum @xmath105 and a nucleon of zero momentum .",
    "the results are displayed by the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : kaon5 ] .",
    "while the real part is barely affected by this simplified approximation , the imaginary part shows some non - negligible differences at low momenta .",
    "secondly , we have neglected , in addition , the nucleon single - particle potential , which has been claimed to be unimportant in ref .",
    "note that in this later reference a small imaginary part of around 10 mev for the nucleon optical potential is used , but the real part is set to zero .",
    "the results are shown by the dotted line .",
    "the differences with the dashed line are quite appreciable at low momenta , both for the real and imaginary parts of the @xmath1 optical potential .    finally ,",
    "once self - consistence is reached , we calculate the full energy dependence of the @xmath41 self - energy which defines the in - medium @xmath15 single - particle propagator and its spectral density through eqs .",
    "( [ eq : prop ] ) and ( [ eq : spec ] ) . the spectral density at zero momentum is shown in fig .  [ fig : kaon7 ] for several densities .",
    "as density increases the peak of the @xmath1 pole moves towards lower energies since the @xmath1 optical potential becomes more attractive .",
    "the in medium @xmath7 resonance gets wider and , although not signaled by any clear peak in the figure , its presence can be indirectly noticed from examining the @xmath1 spectral density on the right hand side of the quasiparticle peak , which falls off more slowly than that on the left hand side .",
    "we also notice some structure of the spectral function to the left of the quasiparticle peak at energies of the @xmath1 of around @xmath107 mev , the origin of which can be traced back to a pole of the free @xmath5 amplitude obtained with the jlich interaction in the @xmath108 , @xmath23 channel at an energy @xmath109 mev , about 200 mev below the @xmath5 threshold .",
    "this pole comes from the @xmath11 pole diagram of the bare jlich potential which moves @xmath110 mev up in energy due to the iteration process involved in @xmath111-matrix .",
    "hence , the peak in the spectral function is the in - medium reflection of this singularity in the free space @xmath111-matrix .",
    "the dotted line shows the spectral density at @xmath49 but keeping only the @xmath2 component of the @xmath5 interaction . in agreement with the behavior of the optical potential at zero momentum , we observe that the location of the quasiparticle peak only moves a few mev , while the width ( height ) gets reduced ( increased ) by about 30% .",
    "we have performed a microscopic self - consistent calculation of the single - particle potential of a @xmath41 meson embedded in symmetric nuclear matter , using the meson - exchange jlich @xmath112 interaction .",
    "due to the strong energy dependence of the @xmath112 @xmath16-matrix it becomes crucial to follow a self - consistent procedure to evaluate the @xmath41 self - energy . in this work",
    "we have analyzed two self - consistent schemes which produce substantial different results .",
    "when only the real part of the @xmath1 optical potential is retained in the self - consistent procedure , one obtains an attraction of about @xmath92 mev at zero momentum and a very small imaginary part of around @xmath97 mev .",
    "this optical potential would lead to extremely narrow deeply bound kaonic states in nuclei .",
    "however , when the complete complex optical potential is self - consistently determined , the real part becomes 15% less attractive and the imaginary part increases to around @xmath98 mev , as a consequence of the widening of the antikaon strength which produces a @xmath5 amplitude smoother and more spread out over energies .",
    "we have obtained the kaon optical potential as a function of the @xmath3 momentum , up to regions that are relevant in the analysis of heavy - ion collisions where antikaons are created with a finite momentum .",
    "our results for the optical potential show a momentum dependence which is moderate for the real part and significantly more relevant for the imaginary part , which is especially important for densities around the saturation density .    we have also studied the effect of including the higher partial waves of the @xmath5 interaction .",
    "some influence is already seen at zero @xmath1 momentum but the largest effects appear clearly at large momenta , where the inclusion of the @xmath113 partial waves of the @xmath5 interaction can practically double the size of the optical potential . at a @xmath114 momentum of 500 mev",
