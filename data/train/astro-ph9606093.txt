    "a very - long - baseline interferometric ( vlbi ) radio image of supernova 1986j shows a shell of emission with protrusions ( @xcite ) .",
    "these protrusions extend from the center to twice the radius of the shell .",
    "the shell boundary is commonly associated with the forward shock of the ejecta .",
    "the cas a also shows several bow - shock features that are thought to be the results of high - velocity clumps ( @xcite ) .",
    "these bow - shock features serve as clear examples of aspherical expansion of supernova ejecta .",
    "deviation from spherical symmetry in the expansion of supernova remnants could be caused by a number of mechanisms .",
    "asymmetric explosion of the supernova itself coming from an early instability such as rayleigh - taylor ( r - t ) instability of the stellar core / envelope ( @xcite ) might result in these protrusions , as well as the bow - shock features in cas a. several v - shaped features in the x - ray image of the vela supernova remnant have been proposed to be the result of fragments ejected during the formation of the neutron star ( @xcite ) .",
    "loeb et al . (",
    "1995 ) suggested that fragmentation may occur during gravitational collapse as a result of both convective and rotational instabilities . on the other hand",
    ", gull ( 1975 ) suggested that the fast moving knots in cas a could be produced by the r - t instability in the decelerating supernova remnant shell ( different from the early r - t instability inside the exploding star ) .",
    "numerical simulations show that the growth of r - t fingers in supernova remnant shells expanding into a uniform ambient medium can not reach the forward shock front ( @xcite ) .",
    "the investigation of the shell r - t instability has been extended to include the effect of radiative cooling ( @xcite ) , because radiative cooling is expected to increase the density contrast in the unstable region , and , therefore , the growth of the r - t fingers .",
    "however , it turns out that even then the unstable fingers are not able to form the protrusions through the forward shock .",
    "recently , blondin , lundqvist , and chevalier ( 1996 ) carried out numerical simulations of the interaction of a supernova with an axisymmetric density distribution which has a high density in equator .",
    "they found that a protrusion appears along the axis if the angular density gradient exceeds a moderate value .",
    "this model is able to generate two oppositely directed polar protrusions .",
    "however , another mechanism is still required to produce more than two protrusions .",
    "we propose that multiple protrusions from a shell in supernova remnants can be produced through the interaction of the shell with a clumpy ( cloudy ) medium .",
    "the existence of such clumps have been invoked by many authors to explain various observations .",
    "for example , the interaction of ejecta with a clumpy wind model has been proposed as the origin of the broad and intermediate - width lines in the spectrum of the peculiar supernova sn 1988z ( @xcite ) .",
    "chugai and danziger also identify the optical emission of sn 1986j with the radiation from the shocked dense component of the clumpy presupernova wind .",
    "they argue that the clumpy circumstellar medium model is more attractive than the clumpy ejecta model in sn 1986j because the early optical spectra do not provide any evidence for clumpiness in the outer layers of the envelope .",
    "the evolution of supernova remnants in a clumpy ambient medium has been studied by one - dimensional numerical simulation by several authors ( @xcite ) .",
    "a two - dimensional study of this model has recently been carried out to explore the strong radio emission from the shell ( @xcite ) . in this _ letter _ , we illustrate that shell protrusions can be produced by the enhanced growth of r - t fingers as a result of their interactions with a clumpy medium .",
    "our model does not require an aspherical explosion of the supernova .",
    "the key physics of our model is the fluid dynamics of engulfed clouds in the intershock region .",
    "the primary effect of a cloudy medium on the r - t fingers is to disturb and disrupt them .",
    "however , we discovered an additional effect , which is that vorticity generated by shock - cloud interactions can enhance the growth of large r - t fingers through a collective effect , which we illustrate through numerical simulations .",
    "in this section , we discuss the necessary condition for the r - t fingers to penetrate the outer shock and ask why the r - t fingers in a uniform medium model could not produce the protrusions . generally , if the terminal velocity of the r - t finger is greater than @xmath0 ( the postshock fluid speed for a strong @xmath1 adiabatic shock ) where @xmath2 is the escape velocity and @xmath3 is the shock velocity , the r - t finger can protrude through the shock front .",
    "the terminal velocity of the finger @xmath4 can be determined roughly by equating the ram pressure with the effective gravitational force ( @xcite ) . here",
    "@xmath5 is the finger density , @xmath6 is the background density , @xmath7 is the effective gravity , and @xmath8 is the finger radius .",
    "therefore , a larger and denser finger reaches a higher terminal velocity for a given effective gravity .",
    "the terminal velocity of the r - t finger can be written as a function of mass density alone for a given effective gravity using mass conservation .",
    "the result is @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , as studied by chevalier and blondin ( 1995 ) , contraction of the finger by radiative cooling will increase the terminal velocity .",
    "numerical simulations ( @xcite ) show that even the largest r - t finger formed in a adiabatic shell expanding into a uniform medium can not reach a sufficient terminal velocity to penerate the shock front .",
    "figure 1a ( no cooling included ) shows that the largest r - t fingers extend through only about half of the intershock region in a uniform medium model .",
    "this limited extension of the r - t fingers is due to the drag and the divergence of the volume in spherical geometry ( @xcite ) .",
    "the finger expands faster than its environment as it moves outward and the expanded finger will reach a lower terminal velocity since , under these cirsumstances , @xmath10 . also , the finger sheds its mass due to the kelvin - helmholtz instability resulting in a lower terminal velocity . even in the presence of radiative cooling , the r - t fingers did not produce protrusions penetrating the outer shock ( @xcite ) .",
    "these numerical results suggest that in order for the finger to reach a sufficient velocity to achieve penetration , additional kinetic energy needs to be added to the finger by some new mechanism .",
    "we have discovered that the vorticity created by multiple shock - cloud interactions provides such a mechanism .",
    "as a number of authors have reported , the interaction between a shock wave and a dense cloud results in cloud fragmentation and turbulent mixing through a combination of the kelvin - helmholtz and the rayleigh - taylor instabilities ( @xcite ) .",
    "these simulations assume a single isolated cloud and a uniform post - shock state . however , the interaction of a r - t unstable supernova remnant shell with multiple clouds is considerably more complex .",
    "for example , refraction of the shock wave by the clouds leads to enhanced transverse mixing through a collective effect ( @xcite ) .",
    "we study the collective effect of the shock - cloud interactions on the expansion of supernova remnants and the growth of the r - t fingers by using a multi - dimensional mhd code ( zeus-3d )",
    ".      in our simulation the initial density profile of the ejected supernova material follows a power law with @xmath11 in the outer 3/7 of the star s mass and a constant density in the inner 4/7 of the star s mass .",
    "an initial energy of @xmath12 is deposited as kinetic energy .",
    "the initial condition of the supernova is the same as the one in jun and norman ( 1996a ) .",
    "a number of small clouds ( 76 ) are distributed randomly in the ambient medium of density @xmath13 .",
    "the constant density contrast between the cloud and intercloud medium is chosen to be 5 .",
    "the clouds are given a circular cross - section shape with constant radius , @xmath14 .",
    "a @xmath15 ambient magnetic field is assumed to be tangential to the shock front and lying in the computational plane .",
    "the computation is carried out in a two - dimensional wedge of @xmath16 radians in spherical polar geometry .",
    "the computational plane is resolved uniformly with 1200 zones in the radial direction and 600 zones in the angular direction .",
    "after 500 years ( @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the mass ratio defined by the swept - up mass divided by the ejecta mass ) , about 51 clouds are encountered by the shock front .",
    "the filling fraction of the area occupied by the clouds at this time is only about @xmath19 .",
    "our choice of initial conditions was originally aimed at the study of young supernova remnants a few hundred years of age .",
    "therefore , much smaller clouds in a circumstellar medium with a power law background density , @xmath20 , would be more appropriate to model the early protrusions in the remnants of type ii supernova .",
    "however , the qualititive description of the mechanism will remain the same .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the intershock region in a clumpy medium model can be characterized by three stages ( @xcite ) .",
    "they are the development of the r - t instability , the interaction between the shock and the overrun clouds , and the collective effect of the clouds engulfed by the shock in the intershock region .",
    "first , the r - t instability driven by the deceleration of the ejecta develops near the contact discontinuity with the shocked ambient gas . the nonlinear growth of the r - t instability has been studied in detail in 2d and 3d ( @xcite ) . as the first cloud encounters the supernova shock , it is compressed by the shock transmitted into the cloud . the incident shock is also reflected into the intercloud region forming a bow - shock ( @xcite ) .",
    "this bow - shock is much weaker than the original shock giving in our simulation a compression ratio about 2 .",
    "the kelvin - helmholtz instability develops at the cloud surface due to the sheared flow between the cloud and the bow shock .",
    "when the cloud shock reaches the rear of the cloud , a rarefaction wave is reflected back into the cloud leading to a reexpansion of the shocked cloud ( @xcite ) .",
    "now the cloud is destroyed by combined instabilities .",
    "when the shocked clouds are subsequently overrun by the contact discontinuity , the r - t fingers formed from the snr contact discontinuity are disrupted by the ensuing collisions and the snr reverse shock is severely deformed .",
    "the disrupted clouds interact strongly with the supernova ejecta , and the flow in the intershock region becomes turbulent .",
    "the complexity of the intershock flow increases as the formed shock overruns more clouds .    as the supernova",
    "remnant expands , the intershock region broadens accordingly and the direct impacts of cloud collisions on the global structure of the shell are less important .",
    "that is because the shocked clouds are disrupted more completely due to the longer travel time before they reach the contact discontinuity from the forward shock .",
    "then large r - t fingers can develop without much disturbance from the clouds , a because the wavelength is much larger than the cloud .",
    "locally , however , shock - cloud interactions maintain a higher level of shell turbulence than in the uniform medium model ( compare figs .",
    "1a and 1b ) .",
    "the developed r - t fingers now interact with a number of eddies generated from the shock - cloud collisions .",
    "the motion of r - t fingers can be deflected as they encounter strong eddies . as a result ,",
    "the growth of r - t fingers can either be aided or hindered , depending on the sense of eddy rotation .",
    "figure 1b shows the density image of a supernova remnant in a clumpy medium when the remnant swept up 4 times its own mass ( t=500 years ) .",
    "the first obvious result is that the entire intershock region is turbulent .",
    "both the forward shock and the reverse shock are deformed by collisions with the clouds .",
    "the `` protrusion '' from the shell is just forming out of a large r - t finger ( see also figure 2 which shows the protruding finger at t=650 years ) . we observed the formation of strong vortices on the right side of this finger due to successive shock - cloud interactions and eddy mergers ( we discuss this mechanism in more detail in section 4 . ) .",
    "note that only one finger out of several in this simulation will lead to a `` protrusion '' .",
    "so , the mechanism is expected to generate only a few protrusions over the entire blast wave .",
    "figure 1c shows that strong magnetic fields around this long r - t finger extended up to the forward shock front .",
    "this strong magnetic field structure will likely stand out through enhanced radio emission if an energetic electron population is accelerated by the shocks or incorporated from the external medium . to establish the composition of material in the protrusion , we can examine the distribution of the mass fraction , which is a passively advected quantity ( @xcite ) and allows us to identify ejected stellar material .",
    "figure 1d represents the distribution of the mass fraction in the intershock region where the black color corresponds to the ejected stellar material .",
    "it is clearly illustrated that the material in the core of protrusion is composed of the supernova ejecta . since that should include heavy elements",
    ", this region should be a strong x - ray emitter .",
    "strong vorticies are generated by the velocity shear between the cloud shock and the intercloud shock .",
    "then the flow speed at the edge of the vortex @xmath21 is approximately @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the cloud shock velocity and is given as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the mass density of cloud .",
    "this linear velocity can be as high as @xmath26 .",
    "it can be higher than the escape velocity , @xmath2 , if @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , a disrupted cloud will generate a very strong vortex .",
    "the interaction of the r - t finger with a single , strong vortex can enhance the growth of the r - t finger significantly .",
    "this enhancement can be even greater if the interaction occurs with a larger vortex generated by vortex - vortex mergers .",
    "the interaction between two eddies in two dimensional flow depends on the sign of vorticity .",
    "eddies of like vorticity ( same sign of vorticity vector ) will tend to merge with each other while eddies of opposite sign of vorticity will tend to avoid each other .",
    "vortex interactions in three dimensions is considerably more complex than this , with the result that eddy mergers may occur less frequently in three dimensions .",
    "however , eddy mergers are not essential to produce the protrusions . the critical point for the r - t finger to achieve a sufficient terminal velocity is the efficient transfer of rotational energy to the r - t finger .",
    "whenever two adjacent eddies have opposite signs of vorticity , they can allow a flow channel to form between them .",
    "therefore , once the r - t fingers enter a channel with the flow directed towards the forward shock , the moving finger obtains more kinetic energy and moves faster .",
    "the r - t finger can be further boosted by a successive interaction with vorticies and therefore produce the `` protrusion '' as depicted in figure 3 . in our model , additional kinetic energy for",
    "the protrusion originates from the outer shock .",
    "the cloud plays a role as a mediator that transfers the kinetic energy of the outer shock ( blast wave ) into the r - t fingers .",
    "the extracted kinetic energy from the blast wave by the cloud encounters results in the retarded propagation of the blast wave , therefore satisfying energy conservation .    in our idealized numerical simulation , the size and density of clouds",
    "are assumed as constants throughout the space . in order to identify the roles played by the size and mass density of clouds in boosting the growth of r - t finger",
    ", we should consider kinetic energy conservation between the finger and vortex ( rotating material formed by a disrupted cloud ) .",
    "the total kinetic energy of the finger and cloud can be written as a sum of kinetic energy of the finger and the rotational energy of the vortex @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the moment of inertia of the vortex , @xmath30 is the angular velocity of the vortex , @xmath31 is the finger mass , and @xmath32 is the terminal velocity of the finger .",
    "the rotational energy of the cloud vortex can also be approximated as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the mass of cloud vortex that rotates with the velocity @xmath21 .",
    "now one can derive the final velocity of the finger ( @xmath35 ) after the cloud vortex has merged into the finger and transfered its rotational kinetic energy , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the energy transfer efficiency between the finger and the cloud vortex . to produce the protrusion",
    ", the final velocity has to exceed the escape velocity @xmath2 . assuming that the finger is at rest before it interacts with the cloud vortex ( just to consider the effect of the cloud vortex )",
    ", one can get the condition for the protrusion as functions of the cloud mass and density @xmath38 therefore , one can see that the final velocity of the finger increases as the mass and density of the cloud increases .",
    "however , it should be noted that the size and mass density of the cloud are critical quantities in determining the cloud disruption timescale that will be required to form the vortex . for larger and denser clouds",
    ", the disruption takes longer . according to klein et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , small clouds are destroyed in several cloud crushing times , where the cloud crushing time @xmath39 is defined as the time for the shock to cross through the cloud . by taking the parameters used in our simulation",
    ", we obtain a cloud crushing time , @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , the clouds are expected to be destroyed within a few decades .",
    "that is in a good agreement with the results in our simulation , where individual clouds took about 100 years to be completely destroyed .",
    "allowing time for the r - t finger to travel up to the outer shock front , it is expected to take a few hundred years before the r - t finger protrudes through the shock front .",
    "this is why the protrusion of the finger appears in the later stage of the evolution in our simulation .",
    "although denser and larger clouds can play a bigger role in transfering the rotational energy to the finger , the cloud needs be disrupted before it interacts with the r - t finger , which sets the upper limit of the density and size of a cloud that can participate in this process .",
    "in addition , the distribution of clouds is also important , since the shocked cloud can affect the growth of the r - t finger negatively as well as positively . in order to understand the detailed dynamical picture ,",
    "further numerical investigation will be required .",
    "the ultimate fate of the protrusion is unknown as yet , because we could not evolve the remnant much longer due to the limited computational domain .",
    "cowie ( 1975 ) predicted that the penetrating r - t finger can be re - overtaken by the shock wave due to the increased ram pressure encountered by the finger once it breaks through the shock .",
    "he conjectured that the fragments will oscillate in and out of the blast wave .",
    "however , this oscillation process is questionable .",
    "we speculate that a secondary shock may be produced by the increased ram pressure and transmitted into the r - t finger as the finger protrudes through the outer shock ( blast wave ) .",
    "the finger will begin to be destroyed by rayleigh - taylor and kelvin - helmholtz instabilities",
    ". this process will be very similar to the dynamical evolution of a cosmic bullet studied by jones , kang , and tregillis ( 1994 ) .",
    "as the finger is destroyed by the combined instabilities , it will be decelerated and be overtaken by the outer shock .",
    "now , the bow - shock produced by the protruding finger may become flattened by the stabilizing effect of the strong shock .",
    "this recovery process may take a long time if the density and velocity of the protruding r - t finger is large .",
    "also , the evolution of the remnant in a wind - blown ambient medium , where the density is proportional to @xmath41 , may result in a different protrusion dynamics ; possibly a stronger protrusion as seen in sn 1986j .",
    "the dynamics of the protrusions will be of great importance in explaining observed structures , since it may be strongly associated with emission processes .",
    "as the material in the protruding finger disperses , the emission ( radio , x - ray , and possibly optical ) will fade away .",
    "it is likely that this process will control the timescale of the disappearance of the bow - shock features in cas a identified by braun et al .",
    "for example , the opening angle of the bow - shock features will become narrower or wider depending on the evolutionary stage .",
    "we have found that the interaction of r - t fingers and circumstellar cloudlets in young supernova remnants can enhance the growth r - t fingers significantly and generate protrusions from the shell , as the large r - t finger distorts the outer shock front .",
    "some r - t fingers obtain extra kinetic energy through their successive interactions with vortices generated by the shocked clouds . therefore , extra kinetic energy for the protrusions originates from the kinetic energy of the blast wave , and the cloud plays a role as a mediator between the outer shock and the r - t fingers .",
    "the protrusion process takes place after the intershock region becomes turbulent due to cloud disruptions .",
    "the timescale for the protrusions is sensitive to the size and mass density of the cloud as well as the number density and distribution of clouds in the circumstellar medium .",
    "our model suggests that the origin of bow - shock features in cas a could be protruding r - t fingers .",
    "we also suggest that our mechanism can be a possible origin for protrusions in remnants such as sn 1986j while much smaller clouds in the circumstellar medium will be required to produce protrusions in the immediate circumstellar environment .",
    "our model suggests that the protrusions may be the sites of strong radio and x - ray emission .",
    "further simulations are needed to study the effects of three - dimensionality , gradients in the ambient medium , and different cloud properties on the dynamics of shell protrusions .",
