    "passive linear optical elements are ubiquitous in the study of interactions between matter and polarized classical  @xcite or quantum light  @xcite .",
    "while polarizers attenuate one of two distinguished orthogonal polarization forms , linear retarders and rotators alter the state of polarization while preserving the flow of light energy through the device .",
    "the latter two belong to the class of non - absorbing linear elements , where the term `` linear '' refers to the fact that the action of such a device on the state of polarization can be conveniently described by a unitary two - by - two _ transfer matrix_. in contrast , a polarizer would be represented by a hermitean matrix .",
    "this description of linear optical elements in terms of hermitean and unitary matrices is called the _ jones formalism _  @xcite .    in his treatise on classical light  @xcite , poincar found that any non - absorbing passive linear optical element could be decomposed into basic linear retarders and rotators . by linear retarder",
    "we mean a homogeneously anisotropic device , such as a piece of appropriately cut crystal , which possesses two preferred axes , called the `` fast '' and `` slow '' axis , which are perpendicular to each other and differ in the phase velocity of component waves linearly polarized along the distinguished directions ; as a consequence , light possessing a general elliptic polarization state will accumulate a relative phase retardation between the two components and thus change its polarization form .",
    "a rotator , on the other hand , changes the plane of linearly polarized light by a specified angle ; it can be shown easily that this effect is due to a phase retardation between the two orthogonal components of _ circular _ polarization .",
    "accordingly , a linear retarder is determined by specification of , e.g. , the angle of the fast axis , and the relative phase retardation ; while a single rotation angle is sufficient to specify a rotator .",
    "this decomposition of a general non - absorbing optical element into retarders and rotators is called the _ poincar equivalence theorem _ ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent account ) .",
    "such a decomposition proves very useful whenever the determination of the internal stress tensor of a transparent medium by means of non - destructive methods is desired .",
    "this issue arises in the following context : material scientists and engineers wish to gain insight into the stress and strain fields in the interior of a loaded specimen . amongst the many different approaches ,",
    "three methods are most often used : ( 1 ) an educated guess at the analytic mathematical form of the internal stress or strain tensor is made ; ( 2 ) the external load acting on the specimen is systematically approximated by forces applying on finitely many points on the _ surface _ of the object ; and the resulting stress in the interior is then computed using numerical schemes generically called _ finite element methods _ ( fem )  @xcite ; ( 3 ) the phenomenon of _ photoelasticity _ is utilized to gain insight into the internal stress distribution .",
    "the term photoelasticity refers to the fact that some transparent materials , typically resins or glasses , become birefringent when under external load , while being optically isotropic in the unloaded state . within certain limits ,",
    "the relation between the dielectric tensor @xmath0 and the stress tensor @xmath1 is linear , and is generically called a _ stress - optical law_. its typical form has been given long ago by maxwell  @xcite , @xmath2 where @xmath3 are called stress - optical constants .",
    "this one - to - one relation between dielectric tensor and stress tensor suggests that one builds a model of an industrial component from an appropriate material ( today , plastics are usually used ) and loads the model just as the real object .",
    "the model is then subjected to heat , so as to loosen , and rearrange , the molecular bonds in the material ; and subsequently cooled down , or `` stress - frozen '' , upon which the stress pattern remains locked inside the material  @xcite . to determine these patterns , destructive and non - destructive methods are available .",
    "a particular example of non - destructive evaluation has been termed `` integrated photoelasticity ''  @xcite . here , polarized light is sent through the specimen at many different angles , and the change in polarization form is registered for each light ray ( pixelwise ) , utilizing appropriate combinations of polariscopes and digital cameras . to each ray passing through a specified point , and along a specified direction",
    ", a unitary transfer matrix @xmath4 can be assigned , which describes how the polarization form changes along the given ray . in this way we obtain a map from the set of all ( reasonably smooth ) dielectric tensor , or stress tensor , fields in the interior of the specimen , to the collection of transfer matrices , gathered for all necessary points and directions . in the theory of inverse problems and mathematical tomography @xcite , this map is commonly called the _ forward problem_. the associated _ inverse problem _",
    "consists of reconstructing the interior dielectric tensor , or stress tensor , from a given collection of transfer matrices .",
    "the transfer matrices @xmath4 are not observable directly . rather , they are known functions of the global phase of the light beam , and three so - called `` characteristic parameters ''  @xcite , two of which may be regarded as polarization directions , while the third one has the meaning of a `` characteristic phase retardation '' .",
    "their operational meaning is as follows : the _ primary characteristic directions _ determine those planes of linear polarization at the entry into the medium for which the state of polarization of the emergent beam is again linear .",
    "the _ secondary characteristic directions _ determine the planes of linear polarization of the emerging light , if the incident light was linearly polarized in the primary characteristic directions ; in general , they differ from the primary ones .",
    "there are always two orthogonal primary and two orthogonal secondary characteristic directions such that light which is linearly polarized along the two primary directions travels with different phase velocities . as a consequence ,",
    "both waves emerge with a phase difference  the characteristic phase retardation .",
    "the _ characteristic parameters _",
    "@xcite of a linear lossless device are usually taken to be simple linear combinations of the angles specifying one of the primary characteristic directions , and the angle of the associated secondary characteristic direction ; and the characteristic phase retardation ( see section  [ poincareeqtheorem ] ) .",
    "traditionally , the forward problem in integrated photoelasticity is formulated directly in terms of the bulk stress tensor ; however , more recent attempts  @xcite have shown that it may be advantageous to first determine the dielectric tensor inside the model by tomographic means , after which the stress tensor can be computed via the stress - optical law in eq .",
    "( [ stress1 ] ) .",
    "the solution to the inverse problem for the two - dimensional ( 2d ) case , i.e. , when the specimen is a thin slab , and the stress tensor inside possesses only two principal directions , is known long since  @xcite . the general solution to the three - dimensional ( 3d ) inverse problem is not known to date , although it has been shown recently  @xcite that , in the limit of weak optical anisotropy , the 3d inverse problem can be mathematically reduced to six independent 2d inverse problems .",
    "being one of the oldest methods of experimental stress analysis , photoelasticity has been somewhat overshadowed by fem methods over the past two or three decades , but has seen a recent revival with applications in silicon wafer stress analysis , rapid prototyping , fiber optic sensor development , and image processing  @xcite .",
    "as photoelasticity can be regarded as a natural complement to fem numerics , hybrid methods attempting at combining both approaches are becoming popular .",
    "it then becomes a viable task to compare fem results with those obtained by photoelastic tomography .",
    "these considerations describe the context in which the method of determining the characteristic directions of a linear optical element , as given in this paper , is expected to prove useful . specifically , there are four applications of our results in integrated photoelasticity and associated hybrid methods :    1 .",
    "[ item1 ] testing the validity of analytic stress models : here , we start with an educated guess about the analytic form of the bulk stress tensor field ; then compute the associated dielectric tensor via the stress - optical law in eq .",
    "( [ stress1 ] ) ; and use this to compute the transfer matrices of the forward problem numerically , using eq .",
    "( [ forward ] ) in section  [ equations ] below . in order to facilitate a comparison with the characteristic parameters obtained from a direct photoelastic evaluation of a stress - frozen model , a decomposition of the numerically obtained transfer matrices into equivalent retarders and rotators must be performed for each light ray .",
    "such a decomposition has to evaluate the characteristic directions of a given transfer matrix @xmath4 first ; subsequently , the associated characteristic phase retardation follows automatically , as will be shown in section  [ charadirections ] .",
    "it is here where our method of determining the characteristic directions is needed .",
    "2 .   testing the validity of a fem - based calculation : instead of an analytic stress model we might want to compare a bulk stress tensor field evaluated numerically using fem , with photoelastic data .",
    "as in the last item , the stress tensor leads to a dielectric tensor and subsequently to a collection of numerically computed transfer matrices via the forward problem , eq .",
    "( [ forward ] ) .",
    "again , the comparison with actual measurements made on a photoelastic specimen requires the decomposition of these transfer matrices according to the equivalent optical model .",
    "iterative solutions of the inverse problem in integrated photoelasticity : the integral equation  ( [ forward ] ) determining the transfer matrices in terms of the dielectric tensor field is non - linear ; this accounts for the fact that the full solution to the general 3d inverse problem of determining the dielectric tensor in terms of the transfer matrices is not yet known .",
    "iterative numerical schemes to solve eq .",
    "( [ forward ] ) for @xmath0 may be conceived . at each stage of iteration",
    ", the intermediate result for the dielectric tensor can be used to compute a collection of associated transfer matrices , whose characteristic parameters , in turn , may be compared with actual photoelastic data in order to check the convergence of the iterative algorithm . at this last stage",
    "we again need the decomposition of a given transfer matrix in terms of the equivalent optical model .",
    "4 .   stability of inversion algorithms on noisy data : the reliability of a reconstruction depends on how stable the algorithm is with respect to finite errors in measurement data .",
    "this stability can be tested on artificial analytic stress models , as follows : the stress model can be converted into a collection of transfer matrices as explained in item  [ item1 ] . ) above .",
    "we then decompose each @xmath4 into characteristic parameters ; but instead of feeding these data directly into the inversion we subsequently add some numerical noise to the characteristic parameters , thus simulating errors in the measuring apparatus .",
    "these modified data are then fed into the proposed algorithm to check how far the new reconstruction deviates from the one without noise in the data .",
    "a visual example of this procedure is given in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for a standard reconstruction algorithm ( filtered back - projection  @xcite ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we have given a detailed account of the poincar equivalence theorem and its application to construct the equivalent optical model .",
    "in that paper , the decomposition of a given transfer matrix @xmath4 into retarders and rotators was accomplished in a somewhat pedestrian fashion , by parameterising the ( three - dimensional ) manifold of @xmath5 matrices in a suitable way , and then applying elementary trigonometric methods . while mathematically correct , the parameterisation of the @xmath5 manifold as used in ref .",
    "@xcite is inconvenient for computer - based algorithms in that subsets of the boundary of the parameter space of this manifold must be identified in order to obtain a one - to - one relation between parameters and matrices .",
    "this non - trivial topology introduces complications when used in the numerical schemes outlined above . in the present paper",
    "we accomplish the same decomposition in a more elegant way : we show how to reformulate the problem of finding the `` characteristic '' data specifying the equivalent optical model for a given transfer matrix in terms of an eigenvalue problem associated with the unimodular factor of this matrix .",
    "the new method is therefore more suitable for an actual numerical determination of the characteristic data , as we can immediately make use of pre - implemented numerical routines for eigenvalue problems .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section  [ equations ] we briefly discuss the derivation , and physical content , of the basic equations governing integrated photoelasticity , leading to the integral equation  ( [ forward ] ) for the transfer matrices in terms of the dielectric tensor , which can be regarded as the basic equation governing integrated photoelasticity . in section  [ charadirections ]",
    "we introduce our new scheme for determining characteristic parameters for a given optical transfer matrix in terms of an eigenvalue problem . in section  [ poincareeqtheorem ]",
    "we explain the relation of the results so obtained with the poincar equivalence theorem , which was discussed more thoroughly in ref .",
    "@xcite ; and we define the equivalent optical model , and the associated characteristic parameters , in terms of the characteristic directions determined by the method introduced in section  [ charadirections ] . in section  [ summary ]",
    "we summarize the paper .",
    "we consider a non - magnetic material which is transparent for optical wavelengths ; and which is optically isotropic ( @xmath6 ) when unloaded but becomes birefringent when under external load .",
    "plastics and certain resins exhibit these properties .    as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , the spatial variation of the optical inhomogeneity in the material  acquired under loading  can be characterised by the trace @xmath7 of the dielectric tensor ; a heuristic length scale @xmath8 then gives the distance over which the relative change in @xmath7 is comparable to one .",
    "furthermore , since the loaded medium is optically anisotropic at each point , two preferred polarization directions@xcite exist for each direction of propagation .",
    "if the medium were homogeneously anisotropic , like a crystal , these preferred directions would be constant through the whole medium ; in photoelasticity , however , the anisotropy in @xmath0 will vary at each point in the material , so that another heuristic scale @xmath9 , denoting the distance along which the relative change of a given preferred polarization direction is comparable to one , may be defined . if these two scales are substantially larger than the wavelength of the light passing through the material , @xmath10 , the propagation of light through the specimen can be described in the _ geometrical - optical approximation _",
    "@xcite , where the complex electric field of the light beam may be written in the form @xmath11 here , the _ eikonal _ @xmath12 describes a locally - plane wave , with local wave vector @xmath13 , and local amplitude @xmath14 . by assumption ,",
    "both of these quantities vary weakly on the length scale of a wavelength @xmath15 .",
    "it is then convenient to introduce a dimensionless scale  @xcite , @xmath16 in terms of which the geometrical - optical limit is simply characterised by @xmath17 .",
    "furthermore , an explicit measure of anisotropy may be given by the relative deviation of @xmath18 from its isotropic value  @xcite ,    [ scale5 ] @xmath19    where the global maximum @xmath20 characterises the magnitude of anisotropy in the dielectric tensor . in principle",
    ", this inhomogeneous anisotropy would lead to a continuous splitting of light rays in the medium  @xcite , due to the fact that two distinct phase velocities , and two distinct ray velocities , for any given propagation direction exist at each point  @xcite .",
    "however , experimentally , no ray splitting is seen in typical photoelastic measurements ; rather , light rays propagate , for all practical purposes , along straight lines through the object , and the only effect of the optical tensors on the light beam is to rotate the preferred polarization directions .",
    "this observational fact indicates that , in the context of ( industrially relevant ) photoelasticity , the anisotropy of @xmath0 is so weak as to permit a replacement of the two actual rays by one single , `` effective '' ray , which is obtained from the isotropic part @xmath7 of the dielectric tensor alone .",
    "the mathematical condition for this to be true has been given in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath21 in this case , the local wave vector @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ geomopt1 ] ) may be taken as globally constant , @xmath23 , so that  ( [ geomopt1 ] ) describes a strictly plane wave @xmath24 only the weakly varying amplitude @xmath14 then encodes the structural inhomogeneities in the material .    in the limit of the geometrical - optical approximation @xmath25 , and under the condition of negligible ray splitting  ( [ elec5 ] ) , the condition of _ weak anisotropy _",
    "@xmath26 is automatically satisfied . in this case",
    "the electric field may be taken as transverse to the propagation direction @xmath27 of the light beam  @xcite . upon inserting the trial solution  ( [ geomopt2 ] ) into the wave equation @xmath28 and retaining only first - order spatial derivatives  corresponding to the geometrical - optical limit  we arrive at an equation of the form @xmath29 here , @xmath30 is the phase velocity in the unloaded material , and @xmath31 is the dielectric tensor .",

    "( [ forward ] ) is the basic equation governing integrated photoelasticity : it determines the transfer matrices @xmath4 for a given light ray , as functions of the anisotropic part @xmath35 of the dielectric tensor in the interior of the medium .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath4 must be unitary , preserving the norm of the complex electric field vector .",
    "this is clear on physical grounds , as preservation of the norm of @xmath40 implies preservation of intensity , so unitarity here just expresses energy conservation of the light beam .",
    "this is just to be expected , since we have assumed a non - absorbing medium .",
    "( [ forward ] ) is manifestly non - linear in @xmath4 , since the transfer matrices appear under the integral on the right - hand side .",
    "this can be seen by iteratively inserting the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ forward ] ) into the right - hand side , leading to the born - neumann series @xmath41 this nonlinearity provides one of the major mathematical challenges in the theory of integrated photoelasticity . as a consequence ,",
    "the inverse problem of determining @xmath35 in terms of a collection of transfer matrices is highly non - trivial .",
    "in the previous section we have seen that , in the theory of integrated photoelasticity , a transfer matrix @xmath4 can be assigned to each light ray which passes a photoelastic material through a given point , and along a specified direction .",
    "this means that the associated light path may be regarded as a linear lossless optical element which acts on the given light ray by changing its polarization form .",
    "as explained in the introduction , there are several occasions in photoelastic stress analysis , hybrid fem - photoelastic methods , and methods determining the numerical stability of numerical algorithms aiming at reconstructing the dielectric tensor from the collection of  tomographically determined  transfer matrices , where the decomposition of a given transfer matrix @xmath4 according to the equivalent optical model is an issue .",
    "as will be shown in this section , the major step in this task is to determine the characteristic directions of the transfer matrix @xmath4 .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , a lossless linear passive optical device possesses in general two so - called _ primary characteristic directions _",
    "@xcite @xmath42 , in the plane perpendicular to the entry of the optical element , which have the following significance : if a light beam at the _ entry _ is plane - polarized in one of the directions @xmath43 ( our convention is such as to define the direction of polarization along the electric displacement field @xmath44 ) it will leave the device again in a state of plane polarization , with the plane oriented along unit vectors @xmath45 , called the _",
    "secondary characteristic directions_. in contrast , for any direction other than @xmath46 the beam at exit will in general be elliptically polarized . the two primary as well as the two secondary characteristic directions are always perpendicular to each other , so that it suffices to specify the angle @xmath47 and @xmath48 of the first elements @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively ; the second element @xmath51 is then determined up to a sign .",
    "since the polarization state at the exit is again linear the optical device , represented by the unitary matrix @xmath4 , must act on the real polarization vector @xmath43 according to @xmath52 where @xmath53 are the phases picked up by the light beam entering along @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "our goal is to determine a consistent choice of primary and secondary characteristic vectors , together with appropriate values for the phases @xmath55 , from a given transfer matrix @xmath4 .",
    "since @xmath4 is unitary , its determinant is a unimodular number @xmath56 hence we can factorize @xmath4 into @xmath57 where @xmath58 is now a unimodular unitary matrix , @xmath59 .",
    "the choice of @xmath58 is not unique , since both @xmath58 and @xmath60 satisfy @xmath61 .",
    "the phase @xmath62 can be computed from  ( [ action10101 ] ) modulo @xmath63 , the ambiguity in sign obviously related to the double - valuedness @xmath64 of the @xmath5 factor .",
    "we therefore need to stipulate an explicit convention for the two possibilities in the factorization : we choose @xmath62 to be the _ smallest possible non - negative _ solution of  ( [ action10101 ] ) . then @xmath58 is uniquely determined by eq .",
    "( [ action101 ] ) .",
    "we can now rewrite  ( [ action1 ] ) as @xmath65 in principle we can determine the angles @xmath47 and @xmath48 of the primary and secondary directions @xmath43 and @xmath66 by parametrising the manifold of @xmath5 matrices @xmath58 in a suitable way and then using elementary trigonometric relations to express these angles in terms of the coordinates on the @xmath5 manifold , as was done in  @xcite .",
    "however , a method that does not require an explicit coordinate chart on the @xmath5 manifold will be presented now :    suppose that eq .",
    "( [ action1 ] ) holds .",
    "then  ( [ action103 ] ) holds as well , and on taking the complex conjugate of the latter equation we obtain @xmath67 on eliminating @xmath66 from eqs .",
    "( [ action103 ] ) and  ( [ action2 ] ) we find that the directions @xmath43 are _ real _ eigenvectors of @xmath68 , @xmath69 where the superscript @xmath70 denotes a matrix transpose .",

    "we show that @xmath68 commutes with its complex conjugate @xmath71 : any @xmath5 matrix @xmath58 can be represented in the well - known form @xmath72 so that a short computation gives @xmath73 since the right - hand side is real it follows that the left - hand side is equal to its complex - conjugate ; as a consequence , the commutator @xmath74 = 0\\ ] ] must vanish .",
    "this relation is significant , since it can be used , in turn , as a starting point to determine the characteristic directions in an elegant way : given any linear lossless device with unitary jones matrix @xmath75 , the @xmath5 factor @xmath58 will satisfy relation  ( [ action8 ] ) .",
    "this relation implies that the commutator @xmath76 & = \\left[\\ , \\rule{0pt}{11pt }   \\frac{1}{2 } \\big\\ { s^t s + ( s^t s)^ * \\big\\}\\ , , \\;\\ ; \\frac{1}{2i }   \\big\\ { s^t s - ( s^t s)^ * \\big\\}\\ , \\right ] = \\\\   & = - \\frac{1}{4i } \\left [ s^t s , ( s^t s)^ * \\right ] = 0 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] must vanish as well .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of @xmath68 are symmetric , since @xmath68 is . as a consequence of the commutativity  ( [ action9 ] ) ,",
    "both of these matrices share the same ( orthogonal ) system of eigenvectors @xmath43 which must be _ real _ since the real and imaginary parts are so , @xmath77 it follows that @xmath43 are _ real _ eigenvectors of @xmath68 as well , with eigenvalues @xmath78 . on the other hand ,",
    "since @xmath68 is unitary , its eigenvalues must be the unimodular numbers @xmath79 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ action3 ] ) , so that @xmath80    the result  ( [ action10 ] ) shows that the characteristic directions @xmath43 can be obtained as the _ real _ eigenvectors of the matrices @xmath81 or @xmath82 describing the optical element .",
    "its significance lies in the fact that the process of finding the characteristic directions from a given transfer matrix @xmath4 becomes amenable to well - established numerical routines for general eigenvalue problems .",
    "this problem arises e.g. in integrated photoelasticity , or more generally , in any effort to reconstruct the dielectric tensor inside a transparent but inhomogeneously anisotropic optical device from tomographic measurements  @xcite .",
    " this outlines the principle of our method to obtain the characteristic directions of any transfer matrix @xmath4 . to finish our discussion",
    "we now show how to fix the ambiguity in signs of the eigenvectors appearing in  ( [ action3 ] ) and  ( [ action10 ] ) , and the associated phase ambiguity , in a consistent way :    the numerical routine will deliver two eigenvectors @xmath43 , but there are four possible choices @xmath83 for the signs . we thus need to agree on a convention to pick a system from  ( [ ambi1 ] ) : we first choose from @xmath84 the vector which makes an angle with the @xmath85 axis whose modulus does not exceed @xmath86 , so that the @xmath85-component of this vector is always non - negative . without loss of generality",
    "we may assume this to be true for @xmath87 .",
    "next we choose from @xmath88 that vector which makes the system  @xmath89 _ right - handed _",

    "we may assume that this is satisfied by @xmath91 .",
    "the phases @xmath92 can now be obtained from  ( [ action11 ] ) , but obviously only modulo @xmath63 , @xmath93 accordingly we can determine the associated secondary characteristic directions @xmath66 from  ( [ action103 ] ) , but only up to a sign , due to the phase ambiguity .",
    "we therefore have four possibilities @xmath94 for the secondary system .",
    "we now impose two conditions similar to those that made the choice of @xmath43 unique : firstly , we require that the suitable candidate @xmath95 for the first element makes an angle with @xmath96 whose modulus is not larger than @xmath86 . assuming that this is the case for @xmath97 , we must have @xmath98 where @xmath50 .",
    "we then still have the ambiguity of @xmath99 ; our second condition now is to select this sign so that the vector triad @xmath100 is right - handed ; we may assume that @xmath101 is the correct choice .",
    "we have now fixed the ambiguous signs of the characteristic directions ; as a consequence , the phases @xmath92 are determined by eq .",
    "( [ action103 ] ) up to multiples of @xmath102 .",
    "this last indeterminacy is intrinsic and can not possibly removed .",
    "thus we stipulate to let the phases @xmath92 take values in the interval @xmath103 , it being understood that the values of @xmath104 and @xmath105 are _ different _ ; for , if they were equal , they would have been part of the phase @xmath62 which was extracted out of @xmath4 in eq .",

    "finally we show how the representation  ( [ action1103 ] ) of @xmath58 in terms of characteristic directions and phases is related to the decomposition of a lossless linear optical element according to the poincar equivalence theorem  @xcite : to this end we represent eq .",

    "it follows that the matrices @xmath116 are proper rotation matries having unit determinant , i.e. elements of @xmath117 .",
    "then , since @xmath59 it follows that @xmath118 , which implies that the eigenvalues @xmath92 must sum up to a multiple of @xmath102 , @xmath119 .",
