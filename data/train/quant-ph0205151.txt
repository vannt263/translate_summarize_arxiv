    "undoubtedly state entanglement of multipartite systems is one of the most remarkable features of quantum mechanics , with both fundamental and practical implications @xcite .",
    "while performing a central role in discussions of nonlocal correlations @xcite , it is also the basis for quantum cryptography @xcite , teleportation @xcite and dense coding @xcite .",
    "nowadays , the most accessible and controllable source of entanglement arises from the process of spontaneous parametric down - conversion of photons in nonlinear crystals @xcite .",
    "recently , experiments with trapped ions have also demonstrated a high degree of control on entanglement generation @xcite .",
    "technological improvements on experiments involving atoms and cavity fields in both optical @xcite and microwave @xcite frequency regions may lead to new scenarios for entanglement experiments involving massive particles in the near future .",
    "progress in this direction was already achieved in the generation of atomic eistein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) pairs @xcite and in the multiparticle entanglement engineering @xcite .    in quantum information theory , besides the challenge to characterize and quantify the amount of entanglement presented by multipartite systems ( see e.g. @xcite ) , there is a recent effort on understanding the entanglement capability of quantum operations @xcite , and particularly the entanglement capability of ( deterministic ) unitary evolutions @xcite .",
    "one of the main results of these investigations was the dependence of the degree of deterministic entanglement formation with the initial conditions , specially the available entanglement resource ( the initial entanglement before unitary evolution ) .",
    "indeed , from a different point of view , it was recently demonstrated that it is only possible to entangle two light beams in a passive linear device ( a beam splitter ) if one of the input beams is prepared in a nonclassical state @xcite .",
    "remark that instead of the entanglement resource ( the initially available entanglement ) the separate party initial state resource ( nonclassicality of one of the light beams state ) played the role for entanglement formation .    for linear optics implementation of quantum information processing , such as in @xcite",
    ", it would be valuable to extend the above optical deterministic entanglement formation to allow that an available nonclassical light source be directly converted into an entanglement resource following the protocol : _ let an uncorrelated three partite system given by @xmath0 where the normalized state of the party @xmath1 is written as a superposition @xmath2 .",
    "we want an unitary evolution @xmath3 mapping the superposition content of @xmath1 to an entanglement content of @xmath4 , while leaving @xmath1 uncorrelated,@xmath5 where now @xmath6 are the schmidt coefficients for the @xmath4 entangled state . _    throughout this paper we show the possibility to realize the above entanglement protocol in optical devices whenever a nonclassical light source is available .",
    "particularly we show two optical implementations .",
    "one based on fields coupling in nonlinear crystals and another based on a beam - splitter arrangement .",
    "we begin in sec .",
    "ii remarking the ability to entangle light beams through bilinear operations . in sec .",
    "iii we focus our attention on a system with an infinite dimensional hilbert space , a three mode linear bosonic system ( linear equations of motion ) , corresponding to a three partite continuous variable system . in sec .",
    "iv we discuss the role of nonclassicality for the entanglement of the three modes .",
    "we assume the modes initially uncorrelated .",
    "classical states remain uncorrelated as time evolves .",
    "however with a truly quantum resource or state ( a superposition state ) in one of the modes we show how ( near maximal ) entangled states are formed ( ghz like ) .",
    "it is then possible to convert the quantum resource ( nonclassicality ) from one mode to the others entangling them in a bell like state .",
    "the mode with the initial quantum resource is left unentangled following the protocol we addressed above .",
    "the essential question posed here is to the entangling power of a bipartite unitary operation @xmath3 given in terms of linear bogoliubov transformation maps- transformations whose generator form a lie algebra of the * su*(@xmath7 ) group , whose generators are of the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are annihilation operators for parties a and b , respectively . those transformations can not map a classical state into a nonclassical one .",
    "a bipartite bosonic system under the above transformation , such as two light beams on a beam - splitter @xcite , can only be entangled if the state of , at least , one of the parties is nonclassical @xcite . as an example , let two uncorrelated light beams a and b prepared in coherent states @xmath11 and @xmath12 be incident on the two arms of a beam splitter .",
    "any coherent state under this transformation evolves coherently and so the states of the two output light beams a@xmath13 and b@xmath13 are also uncorrelated @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "however , if one of the states of a or b is a legitimate quantum state , i.e. , a nonclassical state , then a@xmath13 and b@xmath13 will be left in an entangled state @xcite . remark that this is not due to the linearity of the transformation , since the same is not valid for linear bogoliubov transformations of the form @xmath16 which together with ( [ su2 ] ) form the algebra of the sympletic group * sp*(4,r)@xcite",
    "hamiltonians of the kind of eq.([s11 ] ) are well known to generate scaling transforms - stretching and contractions in such a way to conserve the volume of the phase space , known in quantum optics as squeezing @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to show that this transformation map is able to entangle prepared in any initial classical state . on the other hand the generators of the * su*(2 ) group generates rotations in the system phase space .    while being impossible to entangle systems prepared in classical states through linear hamiltonians of the ( [ su2 ] ) form , it is still possible to determine conditions for deterministic generation of entanglement when one of the parties is prepared in a special quantum state",
    "this is quite useful as it allows one to understand how a initial one - party quantum state is converted in a @xmath17-parties quantum state .",
    "applicative examples of interacting systems following the hamiltonian above are easily found in quantum optics .",
    "it could describe the interaction between light modes with distinct polarization @xcite , the interaction of light fields and the motion of trapped atoms as in the proposal of parkins and kimble @xcite , or even the interaction between the ionic motional degrees of freedom , let us say , in the _ x , y and z _ directions , of a trapped ion @xcite . in what follows",
    "we give two possible implementations , describing the interaction of three electromagnetic field modes in a nonlinear crystal @xcite , and three beams interacting through beam splitters arrangement , such as depicted in fig.1 .",
    "we will initially consider the general problem for three modes on a nonlinear crystal and then at the end we specify the results for beams splitter operations , where the time dependence is appropriately replaced by transmission and reflection coefficients .",
    "we consider , as depicted in fig .",
    "1(a ) , a nonlinear crystal where two classical pump fields of frequency @xmath18 and @xmath19 are incident , each one suffering first a frequency conversion into an idler and a probe field , and then the two idlers are combined in an up - conversion process . besides presenting entanglement in frequency and polarization as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , this system also presents entanglement in occupation number , as we discuss below . by appropriately considering time ordering of the events and photon momentum conservation we can represent the interaction of the two quantum modes , a , b , and c by an effective hamiltonian .",
    "the interaction part for the frequency conversion processes i and ii is given by @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively , where @xmath10 , @xmath22 are the annihilation operators for the signal modes and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the classical pump fields frequencies .",
    "the process iii of up - conversion of the two idler modes @xmath23 and @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 .",
    "the last full quantum hamiltonian can be linearized assuming @xmath26 and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the idlers c - numbers variables . by assuming only terms at most linear in @xmath30 and @xmath31 and neglecting a constant pump @xmath32 effect , we arrive at the effective hamiltonian describing the interaction between the three crystal output modes of em field in the presence of the two classical pumping as @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34\\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\hbar \\kappa \\left[e^{-i\\left(\\mu t-\\theta\\right)}a^\\dagger c+ e^{i\\left(\\mu t-\\theta\\right)}a c^\\dagger\\right ] .\\label{hamil}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the coupling parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 incorporate the pump amplitudes , the coupling between the em - field and the crystal , integrated over the crystal volume , and the idler c - number functions @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 incorporate phase of the above terms .",
    "this rotating wave interaction is pictorially useful as it allows , as presented in @xcite for two modes , not only the transference of energy , but the fully transference of state between the modes .",

    "one can classify a three - partite state as : the * class 1 * ( _ fully inseparable states _ ) is the one where the states can not be written in any of the above forms- when the sate can be written in a state vector form .",
    "an obvious example is the ghz @xmath64 , which is a maximally entangled state of three qubits .",
    "the * class 2 * ( _ 1-qubit biseparable states _ ) constitutes the one where biseparable states with respect to one subsystem are states that are separable with respect to one subsystem , but non - separable with respect to the other two .",
    "that is , states that can be written in the form ( [ d2 ] ) or ( [ d3 ] ) or ( [ d4 ] ) , but not in both of them , i e , exclusively . the * class 3 * ( _ 2-qubit biseparable states _ ) relates to biseparable states with respect only to two of the subsystems .",
    "those are states that can be written in two and only two of the forms ( [ d2 ] ) , ( [ d3 ] ) and ( [ d4 ] ) .",
    "the * class 4 * ( _ 3-qubit separable states _ ) are those that can be written in all of the forms ( [ d2 ] ) , ( [ d3 ] ) and ( [ d4 ] ) , but not as ( [ d1 ] ) . finally the * class 5 * ( _ fully separable states _ ) is related to states that can be written in the form ( [ d1 ] ) .",
    "assuming that the initial joint density operator is fully separable ( * class 5*)@xcite , @xmath65 then the normal joint characteristic function ( [ chisim1 ] ) factorises as @xmath66 in the fourier space the modes evolve in an apparent uncorrelated fashion . the actual correlations are due to the temporal functions @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 . to calculate the evolved joint quantum state we must assume specific initial conditions .      the first and simplest situation to consider is the case where all the modes are initially prepared in coherent states",
    ". let us consider the three modes to be given by the density operators @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the amplitudes of the respective coherent states",
    ". the normal ordered characteristic function ( [ chiachib ] ) can be written as @xmath74 where @xmath75 comparing eq .",
    "( [ chiabc2 ] ) with the expression for the normal ordered characteristic function in the schrdinger picture , it is straightforward to write the density operator for the combined system as @xmath76 where the joint state vector @xmath77 is given by @xmath78 this state vector simply shows that the three modes will never become entangled .",
    "in fact they evolve as separate coherent states .",
    "we started with a fully separable quantum state and it evolved fully separable .",
    "the amplitude of each of the coherent states does change , but not its quantum signature .",
    "while these states may develop classical correlations due to their interaction , to observe quantum correlations such as entanglement requires special conditions on the prepared states .",
    "this example raises several interesting questions . in what follows",
    ", we still assume that the three modes are initially uncorrelated but we consider the initial state of the mode a in a nonclassical state - a superposition of coherent states .",
    "does the three modes remain uncorrelated as the total system evolves ?",
    "how is the information available in its state distributed over the other modes ? to begin this investigation let us describe the initial states as @xmath79 where mode @xmath1 is in the coherent superposition state @xmath80 with the normalisation factor @xmath81 .",
    "for @xmath82 the superposition state given by ( [ gato ] ) is known as the _ even cat state _ ( even coherent state ) @xcite , _ yurke - stoler cat state _ @xcite and _ odd cat state _",
    "( odd coherent state ) @xcite , respectively .    now following the same steps as previously in the last example",
    ", the final joint state of the three interacting modes is given by @xmath83 where @xmath84    in certain parameter regimes ( namely @xmath85 ) we have @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "it can then be seen that ( [ ghzstate ] ) is of the form of an approximate ghz state , and so it is also very close to be maximally entangled ( * class 1*)@xcite .",
    "such characteristics come from the initial superposition nature of the mode a state .",
    "the evolution of these modes is also very interesting in other parameter regimes and at specific times . for simplicity we are going to restrict ourselves to the case in which @xmath89 ( @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) . for @xmath92 , where @xmath930 , 1 , 2 ... , it is easily shown that the joint state recurs to its initial uncorrelated form .",
    "mode a returns to a superposition state , while the modes b and c are coherent states .",
    "no entanglement is seen for such times .",
    "however for times given by @xmath94 the final joint state of the interacting modes is given by @xmath95 where @xmath96 .",
    "here it is clear that mode a is in a coherent state and is definitely not entangled with the modes b+c .",
    "the initial superposition state content of the mode a is completely converted in to an entanglement content ( schmidt coefficient ) of the couple bc .",
    "the resulting state is a _",
    "1-qubit biseparable _ ( * class 2 * ) entangled state @xcite . more specifically , when the modes b and c are prepared in vacuum state and with @xmath97 , the state of eq .",
    "( [ fin ] ) is given by @xmath98 where @xmath99 the couple b - c is in a truly nonseparable entanglement of orthogonal states , independently of the magnitude of @xmath71 .",
    "in fact when mode a is traced out from eq .",
    "( [ fin2 ] ) , the partite b+c system is left in a bell state .",
    "linear optical devices offer an interesting scenario for entanglement manipulation due the efficiency of linear processes over nonlinear ones .",
    "whenever a nonclassical light beam is available , it can be manipulated together with other ( classical ) beams through linear devices in order to achieve the required operation . in what follows",
    "we discuss this situation for the realization of the proposed protocol with three light beams and beam - splitters .",
    "consider the scheme of fig .",
    ". the field with the quantum content , ( @xmath9 ) , is incident on the beam splitter 1 .",
    "the reflected ( @xmath100 ) and transmitted ( @xmath101 ) beams are then mixed in beam splitters 2 and 3 with the fields @xmath10 and @xmath22 , respectively , to give the output beams @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 , through the beam - splitter transformations @xmath106where @xmath107 is the complex transmission coefficient of the beam - splitter @xmath108 and @xmath109 is its reflection coefficient , such that @xmath110 .",
    "@xmath111 is an annihilation operator representing the input vacuum mode at beam - splitter 1 .",
    "it is direct to show that if the @xmath9 input field is prepared in a superposition of coherent states as @xmath112 while the fields @xmath10 and @xmath22 are prepared in coherent states @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively , the above beam - splitter transformation will give@xmath113 where we have used the @xmath114 order for the input and the @xmath115 order for the output , and @xmath116 if , for example we set @xmath117 , such that @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) , the output will be @xmath120 and the quantum resource conversion will be complete .",
    "in summary , we have discussed in this article the possibility of conversion of quantum resources for the deterministic generation of multiparticle entangled systems . we have considered two realization examples of three bilinearly coupled modes of the electromagnetic field : ( i ) through interactions in a non - linear crystal , and ( ii ) through a beam - splitter arrangement . without the presence of a quantum resource ( nonclassical state ) for one of the three parties the resulting system remains completely unentangled ( but may become classically correlated ) .",
    "if however one of the parties is initially prepared in a a nonclassical state , then this quantum resource can be transferred to the other parties .",
    "in fact a maximally entangled ghz ( * class 1 * ) state for the three parties can be generated . as a central result",
    "the superposition resource has been converted into an entanglement resource .",
    "more interesting however is that this superposition resource for party a can be transferred completely to an entanglement resource for parties b and c only generating a * class 2 * state .",
    "parties b and c are left in a maximally entangled bell state while party a is now an unentangled coherent state .",
    "a slightly different parameter regime leaves parties b and c strongly entangled to each other but weakly entangled to a while other parameter regimes leave the total system completely unentangled ( * class 5 * ) .",
    "this results indicate the importance of the nature of the initial state when the modes are bilinearly coupled and how the nonclassical nature of one parties initial state can be shared or exchanged with other parties .",
    "a related inverse problem is the generation of superposition states .",
    "it is straightforward to deduce from the above discussion that the generation of a superposition ( nonclassical ) state in the mode a is possible , in principle , whenever this mode interacts by the hamiltonian here discussed and if the two other modes b and c are prepared in a entangled bell state .",
    "it is interesting to notice how these two intrinsic characteristic of quantum systems , entanglement and superposition states are then related , and that the conservation of quantum information is the strong bond that relates them . throughout this paper we have considered only superposition of coherent states as our quantum resource but any other genuine nonclassical states ( for instance fock states ) generate similar effects .",
