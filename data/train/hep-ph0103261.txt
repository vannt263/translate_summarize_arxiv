    "rare @xmath2 meson decays , induced by flavor  changing neutral current ( fcnc ) @xmath3 transitions , provide potentially stringiest tests of the standard model ( sm ) in flavor sector .",
    "these transitions take place in the sm at loop level , is very sensitive to the gauge structure of the sm .",
    "moreover @xmath4 decay is known to be very sensitive to the various extensions of the sm .",
    "new physics effects manifest themselves in rare @xmath2 meson decays in two different ways , either through new contributions to the wilson coefficients existing in the sm or through the new structures in the effective hamiltonian which are absent in the sm .",
    "note that @xmath4 transition has been extensively studied in framework of the sm and its various extensions @xcite@xcite .",
    "the rare inclusive decays are theoretically much cleaner than the exclusive decays , which require the knowledge of form factors , are also more difficult to measure .",
    "however , fcnc exclusive semileptonic decays , in particular @xmath5 will be measured precisely in the future experiments at cleo and b  factories lhc , hera etc .",
    "as has already been noted , new physics effects in the rare @xmath2 meson decays can appear in two different ways , either through new contributions to the existing in the in the sm through the new operators in the effective hamiltonian which are absent in the sm . using these approaches ,",
    "the @xmath6 decay was studied in @xcite using the most the most general form of effective hamiltonian that includes all possible form of interactions .",
    "it was shown that different physical observables like branching ratio , forward ",
    "backward asymmetry etc .",
    "are very sensitive to the new wilson coefficients .",
    "one efficient way in establishing new physics effects beyond the sm is taking into account polarization effects .",
    "along these lines these effects have been studied for the @xmath0 decay in @xcite , @xcite@xcite .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that there exists region of new wilson coefficients in which the decay rate agrees with the sm prediction while lepton polarization does not . in other words , in this region of new wilson coefficients new physics effects can be established by measuring lepton polarization only but not the branching ratio .    in this connection there follows the following question .",
    "how sensitive is the branching ratio to the new wilson coefficients when @xmath1 meson is polarized longitudinally or transversally ?",
    "the goal of the present work is to find an answer to this question .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , using a general form of four  fermi interaction we derive the model independent expressions for the longitudinal , transversal and normal polarizations of leptons . in section 3",
    "we investigate the dependence of the branching ratios on the four  fermi interactions when @xmath1 meson is polarized transversally or longitudinally .",
    "in this section we calculate the branching ratio of the @xmath0 decay when @xmath1 meson is polarized transversally or longitudinally , using the most general , model independent four  fermi interactions .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for the @xmath7 transition in terms of twelve model independent four  fermi interactions can be written as @xcite [ matel ] h_eff & = & v_tsv_tb^\\ { c_sl |s i _ l b |^+ c_br |s i _ r b |^ + & & + c_ll^tot |s_l _ b_l |_l ^_l + c_lr^tot |s_l _ b_l |_r ^_r + c_rl |s_r _ b_r |_l ^_l + & & + c_rr |s_r _ b_r |_r ^_r + c_lrlr |s_l b_r |_l",

    "the following four terms in this expression are the vector type interactions with coefficients @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "two of these vector interactions containing @xmath19 and @xmath20 do also exist in the sm in combinations of the form @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "therefore one can say that @xmath19 and @xmath20 represent sum the contributions from sm and the new physics , whose explicit forms can be written as c_ll^tot & = & c_9^eff - c_10 + c_ll  , + c_lr^tot & = & c_9^eff + c_10 + c_lr  . the terms with coefficients @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 describe the scalar type interactions .",

    "( 3 ) the dependence of the @xmath66 decay on the new wilson coefficients when @xmath1 meson is polarized longitudinally , is studied .",
    "this figure depicts that the branching ratio is very sensitive to all type of vector and tensor interactions .",
    "note that , for simplicity all new wilson coefficients in this work are assumed to be real and varied in the region between -4 and + 4 . from this figure",
    "we see that when @xmath15 and @xmath17 increases from -4 to + 4 , the branching ratios increases and decreases , respectively , while the dependence of the branching ratio on the tensor interactions have a rather symmetrical form on both sides of the origin . in other words up to zero values of the tensor interaction coefficients the branching ratio decreases ( for the @xmath65 case this symmetry point is slightly shifted ) and it increases from 0 to + 4 .",
    "depicted in fig .",
    "( 4 ) is the dependence of the branching ratio on the new wilson coefficients when @xmath1 is transversally polarized @xmath68 .",
    "obviously this figure for muon decay channel demonstrates strong dependence on tensor interaction coefficients and on the coefficient @xmath15 . in the case of @xmath65 decay",
    "this branching ratio is strongly dependent on tensor interactions .    finally , in figs .",
    "( 5 ) and ( 6 ) we present the dependence of another physically measurable quantity , namely the ratio of the branching ratios @xmath69 on new wilson coefficients . from these figures we conclude that dominant contribution for the @xmath66 decay comes from @xmath17 .",
    "so if in future experiments a larger value for this ratio is observed than the sm prediction , this result can be attributed solely to the vector interaction with coefficient @xmath17 , whose range is @xmath70 .",
    "however if in these experiments smaller values for the same ratio is measured , this departure from the sm prediction can be explained with the help of different mechanisms .",
    "experimentally measured value can give us information which mechanism is responsible for such a discrepancy .",
    "for the @xmath65 case , a measurement of the same ratio which yields @xmath71 indicates the existence of new vector type interaction with coefficient @xmath16 .",
    "it should be noted here that all these calculations are performed for the choice of @xmath72 .",
    "numerical analysis for this choice shows that all conclusions which have been made for the @xmath73 case remains valid , apart from a slight decrease in the magnitude of the branching ratios .",
    "it follows from all these discussions that , the branching ratios when @xmath1 meson has @xmath37 and zero helicities and the ratio of the branching ratios when @xmath1 meson is polarized longitudinally and transversally , are very sensitive to the presence of different new wilson coefficients .",
    "experimental measurement of the branching ratio for the @xmath66 and @xmath65 decays when @xmath1 meson has different polarizations , can give quite valuable information about new physics .",
