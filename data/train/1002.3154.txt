    "the _ chandra _  deep field - north ( cdf - n ) and _ chandra _  deep field - south ( ) are the two deepest _ chandra _  surveys ( see @xcite for a review ) , each covering @xmath12 arcmin@xmath13 areas with enormous multiwavelength observational investments .",
    "together they have detected about 1160 x - ray point sources ( e.g. , @xcite , hereafter l08 ) , with a sky density of @xmath14  deg@xmath15 at the limiting flux of @xmath16  erg  cm@xmath15  s@xmath18  in the 0.52.0 kev band .",
    "most ( @xmath19 ) of these x - ray sources are active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , often obscured , at @xmath204 ; at faint fluxes , some of the sources are starburst and normal galaxies at @xmath202 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the cdf - n and cdf - s provide an ideal opportunity to study agn cosmological evolution , agn physics , the role of agns in galaxy evolution , and the x - ray properties of starburst and normal galaxies , groups and clusters of galaxies , large - scale structures in the distant universe , and galactic stars . however , one prerequisite of such research is to associate the x - ray sources with their correct counterparts at optical , near - infrared ( nir ) , infrared ( ir ) , and radio wavelengths , and then to determine their redshifts either spectroscopically or photometrically .",
    "the cdf - s was recently expanded from @xmath5  ms to @xmath0  ms exposure , and more than 130 new x - ray sources are detected ( l08 ) . meanwhile ,",
    "additional deep multiwavelength surveys of the cdf - s have become available , including the vla radio ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , _ spitzer _ ir ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , nir @xmath21-band ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and _ galex _ uv ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) surveys ; there are also a few recent spectroscopic surveys that provide updated redshift information ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is thus crucial to provide x - ray source identifications in the cdf - s along with their redshifts to facilitate scientific studies .",
    "one major uncertainty about x - ray source identifications in deep surveys is the contamination from spurious matches , e.g. , because of the high source density in deep optical catalogs .",
    "for example , @xcite were able to assign optical counterparts to @xmath22 of the x - ray sources in the @xmath0",
    "ms cdf - n .",
    "however , they estimated the false - match probability to be @xmath2 at @xmath23 , and it will rise to @xmath24 at a simple error - circle method was used in their work , in which the closest optical source within a given matching radius of an x - ray source was selected as the counterpart .",
    "recently , a more sophisticated likelihood - ratio matching approach was adopted for matching x - ray sources in deep _",
    "chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _ surveys to optical / nir sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the likelihood - ratio technique takes into account the positional errors of both the optical and x - ray sources and also the expected magnitude distribution of the counterparts , and thus it can significantly reduce the false - match probability at faint magnitudes .",
    "furthermore , performing the source matching at some wavelengths other than optical , e.g. , nir or radio , can also reduce the false - match probability , as the x - ray sources may be better associated with nir or radio sources . combining the multiwavelength x - ray source identifications will effectively lower the overall false - match probability .",
    "as many x - ray sources in deep surveys are optically faint ( and are therefore challenging targets to obtain spectroscopic redshifts ) , a significant portion of the sources have their redshifts determined photometrically .",
    "photometric redshifts are derived by fitting spectral energy distribution ( sed ) templates to the observed broadband photometric data , and their accuracy is largely controlled by the quality of the data available .",
    "the previous photometric redshifts for the x - ray sources in the @xmath0  ms",
    "cdf - n ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and @xmath5  ms",
    "cdf - s ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are generally accurate to @xmath2 with @xmath825% catastrophic redshift failures .",
    "the superb and improved multiwavelength coverage in the cdf - s has produced full sed sampling for the x - ray sources , from uv to ir , allowing determination of photometric redshifts to significantly higher accuracy .    in this paper , we present multiwavelength identifications of the cdf - s x - ray sources in the main source catalog of l08 .",
    "given the counterpart information , we compose a photometric catalog for these x - ray sources including up to 42 bands of uv  to  ir data .",
    "photometric redshifts are then calculated and compared to the latest secure spectroscopic redshifts to evaluate their accuracy .",
    "the identifications and spectroscopic redshifts presented here supersede the counterpart and redshift information provided in l08 . in ",
    "2 we describe in detail the likelihood - ratio matching method and our multiwavelength identification results . in  3 we present the photometric catalog and the derivation of photometric redshifts .",
    "the accuracy of the photometric redshifts is appropriately estimated . in ",
    "4 we discuss the nature of the unidentified x - ray sources , and present some future prospects toward source identifications .",
    "we summarize in  5 .    throughout this paper , all magnitudes are based upon the ab magnitude system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and we adopt the latest cosmology with @xmath25  km  s@xmath18  mpc@xmath18 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 derived from the five - year wmap observations @xcite .",
    "the x - ray sample we chose is the main _ chandra _  source catalog for the @xmath0  ms , which contains 462 x - ray sources ( l08 ) .",
    "these sources were detected in three x - ray bands , 0.58.0 kev ( full band ) , 0.52.0 kev ( soft band ) , and 28 kev ( hard band ) , with a wavdetect false - positive probability threshold of @xmath28 .",
    "the resulting source lists were then merged to create the main catalog ( see  3.3 of l08 for details ) .",
    "the survey covers an area of @xmath29 arcmin@xmath30 and reaches on - axis sensitivity limits of @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33  erg  cm@xmath15  s@xmath18for the full , soft , and hard bands , respectively .",
    "we have visually checked the positions of all the x - ray sources in l08 during an x - ray spectral extraction process ( bauer  et  al .",
    "2010 , in preparation ) , using the @xmath0  ms cdf - s _ chandra _  events file and sometimes also the @xmath34  ks extended _ chandra _  deep field - south (; @xcite ) events file for sources with large off - axis angles .",
    "although most x - ray sources in l08 have good positions ( no positional offsets or offsets @xmath35 ) , there are five sources having positions off by @xmath36 . these are sources 62 , 90 , 125 , 338 , and 456 , and we shifted their positions by 1.2 , 3.2 , 1.3 , 2.8 , and 1.5 , respectively .",
    "sources 90 and 456 are located at large off - axis angles ( 11.8  and 9.8 ) ; the other three sources are faint ( @xmath3726 detected counts in the soft band with errors of about 810 counts ) , and might be composite sources ( blended with a weak nearby object ) . the complex point spread functions or morphologies of these five sources make it difficult to determine the centroid positions , and their positions reported in l08 are poorly defined .",
    "we searched for counterparts of the @xmath0  ms sources in several deep catalogs , most of which cover the entire region .",

    "due to the high source densities of the onir catalogs and centroid errors in the x - ray positions , the simple method of searching for the nearest counterpart within a small radius could yield a non - negligible number of false matches , usually to faint onir sources where the background source density is high .",

    "the 1 @xmath40 positional errors of the onir sources are either provided by the catalog or estimated from the distributions of positional offsets by matching the sources to the goods - s @xmath42-band catalog .",
    "the onir positional errors and x - ray positional errors are listed in tables  [ matchsum ] and [ cat ] , respectively .",
    "the magnitude - dependent surface density of the background sources , @xmath59 , was estimated using a sample of onir sources that are at a angular distance between @xmath64 and @xmath65 from any of the sources .",
    "we chose sources inside such annular regions to exclude possible counterparts from the background calculation .",
    "the expected magnitude distribution of counterparts @xmath57 is not directly observable . to estimate @xmath57 , we ran the matching procedure in an iterative way .",
    "the matching results from a previous run were used to calculate @xmath57 for the next run . as a first guess",
    ", we selected all onir sources within @xmath66 of any source , and we assume these onir objects are representative of the counterparts for the x - ray sources with a small contribution from coincident background sources .",
    "the number of sources in this sample is @xmath67 , and the magnitude distribution of these sources is denoted as @xmath68 , which was then background subtracted to derive @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the total number of sources in the relevant sample ( see col .",
    "9 of table  [ matchsum ] ) , and @xmath71 .",
    "the background subtraction generally has a small effect ( a few percent ) on the resulting magnitude distribution .",
    "see figure  [ gemszhist ] for an example of @xmath72 and @xmath59 in the gems @xmath42-band catalog . due to the magnitude limits of the onir catalogs , we are only able to detect a fraction @xmath73 of all the true counterparts ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "thus the expected magnitude distribution of counterparts @xmath57 is derived by normalizing @xmath72 and then multiplying by @xmath73 : @xmath75 the factor @xmath73 was first set to @xmath76 .",
    "the magnitude distributions , @xmath57 and @xmath59 , are smoothed using a boxcar average ( with width of one magnitude ) and then used as input in the likelihood - ratio calculation .",
    "we note that source blending , which is most severe in the 3.6  @xmath50 m catalog , could affect the values of @xmath57 and @xmath59 by a tiny fraction and thus introduce small uncertainties in the matching results .",
    "however , as we choose counterparts carefully combining all seven catalogs ( see  2.3 ) , this will not affect our final identifications .",
    "having computed the values of @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , we calculated @xmath77 for all the onir sources within @xmath64 of any of the x - ray sources .",
    "we then chose a threshold value for @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) to discriminate between spurious and real counterparts .",
    "an onir source is considered to be a counterpart for an source if its @xmath77 value exceeds @xmath78 . in some cases",
    ", there will be more than one counterpart for an source within our @xmath64 limiting radius .",
    "if the ratio between the highest and the second highest @xmath77 values is greater than 5 , we keep only the counterpart with the highest @xmath77 value values are coincident matches ; about 16 such unlikely counterparts were identified and removed in total , considering all the optical  to  ir catalogs . because the final counterpart for an x - ray source is selected after combining the matching results for all the catalogs , the chance of removing a possible true counterpart here is negligible . ] ; otherwise , the source is considered to have multiple counterparts in this catalog .",
    "for each counterpart for an source identified this way , we calculate a reliability parameter , @xmath79 , which represents the probability of it being the correct identification : @xmath80 where the sum is over all the counterparts for this source .",
    "the choice of @xmath78 is not unique , and it depends on two factors : first , it should be small enough to avoid missing many real identifications ; second , it should be large enough to prevent having many spurious identifications . in this paper",
    ", we followed the discussions in @xcite , @xcite , and civano  et al .",
    "( 2010 , in preparation ) , and we chose a @xmath78 that maximizes the sum of sample completeness and reliability .",
    "the sample completeness parameter ( @xmath81 ) is defined as the ratio between the sum of the reliability of all the sources identified as counterparts and the total number of sources , @xmath82 .",
    "the sample reliability parameter ( @xmath39 ) is defined as the average of the reliabilities of all the sources identified as counterparts . for each run of the likelihood - ratio method",
    ", we tried several values of @xmath78 and chose the one which maximizes the sum of @xmath81 and @xmath39 .",
    "after the first trial run of the likelihood - ratio procedure , we calculated @xmath72 as the magnitude distribution of all the sources identified as counterparts in the previous run , and we approximated the normalization factor @xmath73 to be the completeness @xmath81 of the previous run .",
    "for each onir catalog , the likelihood - ratio procedure was run iteratively until the resulting values of @xmath81 and @xmath39 converged .",
    "this is a stable process with mild perturbations , and the results converge quickly , usually in @xmath05 iterations .",
    "a summary of the likelihood - ratio matching parameters and results is shown in table  [ matchsum ] .",
    "we list the total number of sources that are within the coverage of the onir catalog ( @xmath70 ) , the number of sources identified with at least one onir counterpart ( @xmath83 ) , the number of sources without identifications ( @xmath84 ) , and the number of sources identified with at least two onir counterparts ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "we estimated the false - match probability of these identifications using a bootstrapping approach .",
    "we shifted the source coordinates by 553(with a 2  increment between shifts ) in right ascension and declination respectively , and recorrelated the shifted sources with the onir sources using the likelihood - ratio method .",
    "this was done for 100 trials , and the results were averaged to estimate the number of false matches .",
    "the expected number of false matches ( @xmath86 ) and the false - match probability for each catalog are shown in table  [ matchsum ] .",
    "the false - match probabilities range from @xmath59% .",
    "the matching to the radio sources yields very secure counterparts , with less than one expected false match , largely due to the small background radio source density .    for each catalog",
    ", we calculated its counterpart recovery rate , defined as the expected number of true counterparts ( @xmath87 ) divided by the number of x - ray sources ( @xmath70 ) , shown in table  [ matchsum ] .",
    "compared to the completeness parameter @xmath81 , the recovery rate parameter utilizes the bootstrapping results , and is a more appropriate estimate of the catalog completeness .",
    "the music nir and simple ir catalogs have the highest recovery rates , while the vla radio catalog recovers the fewest counterparts .",
    "we also calculated an fraction ( x  o fraction ) parameter , defined as the expected number of true counterparts ( @xmath87 ) divided by the number of onir sources ( @xmath53 ) in the catalog .",
    "the x  o fraction indicates the degree of association between the x - ray and onir sources .",
    "only @xmath54% of the optical / nir / ir sources are x - ray sources , whereas @xmath88 of the radio sources are detected by _",
    "chandra_. a larger x",
    " o fraction will lead to more reliable source matching results because of the lower background source density .",
    "both the recovery rate and x  o fraction parameters are dependent on the catalog depth .    given the excellent radio - source positional accuracy and the secure matching results , we can investigate the accuracy of the x - ray source positions using the information for the radio counterparts . in figure  [ dposradio ]",
    ", we show the positional offset between the 94 x - ray sources and their radio counterparts versus off - axis angle . the median offset is @xmath89 , and there are clear off - axis angle and source - count dependencies .",
    "the off - axis angle dependence is mainly due to the degradation of the _ chandra _  psf at large off - axis angles , while the count dependence is due to the difficulty of finding the centroid of a faint source .",
    "although the results are comparable to the l08 study of the positional accuracy based on the matching to the wfi @xmath39-band sources ( see  3.3.1 of l08 ) , figure  [ dposradio ] should be considered more representative of the typical x - ray positional accuracy , as the radio catalog provides the most - reliable x - ray source identification .",
    "twenty of the 462 sources do not have a counterpart in any of the onir databases , based on the likelihood - ratio matching to all seven catalogs .",
    "four ( xids 72 , 165 , 234 , and 396 ) of these 20 sources have a faint onir source ( a @xmath42-band source in each case , with @xmath9026.7 ) within @xmath911.2  of the position ; these onir sources were not selected by the matching due to their small likelihood ratios ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "however , given the relatively small positional offsets of these four sources , the lack of any other apparent counterparts , and the fact that the likelihood - ratio matching is a statistical method and can not possibly identify all the counterparts , we manually assign them as the counterparts of the relevant x - ray sources ( see col .",
    "13 of table  [ cat ] ) .",
    "thus 446 sources have identifications , including these four additional likely cases .",
    "note that the probabilities in table  1 do not apply to these four sources .",
    "for the remaining 16 sources without identifications , there is no onir source within @xmath93 . as the onir catalogs we used were all generated using red bands , we also visually inspected images in bluer bands ( e.g. , @xmath38 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 ) at the positions of these 16 sources , and verified that we did not miss any apparent blue counterparts for them .",
    "eight of these unidentified sources are probably related to some other objects ( e.g. , off - nuclear sources ; see col .",
    "13 of table [ cat ] ) , and the majority of the other eight are likely to be spurious x - ray sources ( see discussion in  [ noiddis ] ) .",
    "twenty of the sources only have a simple counterpart ; however , eight of these simple counterparts have a corresponding optical / nir source nearby ( within 0.8 ) , and they are likely to be the same source .",
    "therefore we used the more accurate optical / nir positions for these eight counterparts ( see col .",
    "13 of table  [ cat ] ) .",
    "some x - ray sources could have multiple counterparts , either from one onir catalog as a result of the likelihood - ratio matching ( e.g. , see the @xmath85 parameter in table  [ matchsum ] ) , or from different optical  to  radio catalogs .",
    "there are 12 sources with multiple counterparts in at least one of the onir catalogs ; none of them has more than two counterparts in one band . for the remaining 434 sources , we consider an source to have multiple counterparts if the angular distance between two of the counterparts in different bands exceeds @xmath96 ( so that they appear to be different sources ) , where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the positional errors in the relevant onir catalogs .",
    "there are 60 such sources ; five of them have three counterparts . in all , 72 sources have multiple counterparts ( with the other 374 x - ray sources having a unique counterpart ) , and they are flagged in column  12 of table  [ cat ] .    for each of the 446 x - ray sources with an identification , we visually inspected all its counterparts in the appropriate bands , and chose a primary one .",
    "the position of this source is the most probable position of the counterpart .",
    "we chose the primary counterpart from , in order of priority , the vla , goods - s , gems , music , wfi , musyc , or simple catalog .",
    "this order is chosen based on several related factors : the positional accuracy , angular resolution ( to minimize any blending effects ) , false - match probability , and catalog depth .",
    "there are a few exceptions : ( 1 ) if the optical counterpart is clearly extended , i.e. , a nearby galaxy , we select the optical position instead of the vla radio position because the radio emission could arise from an off - nuclear structure ( 7 cases ) ; ( 2 ) if the optical counterpart is bright and significant , while the radio counterpart is detected at a smaller than 7  @xmath40 significance , we prefer the optical position ( 4 cases ) ; ( 3 ) when the counterpart from a lower - priority catalog is much brighter and better resolved , or it has a significantly larger reliability parameter , we prefer this source as the primary counterpart ( 5 cases ) . the final number of primary counterparts selected in each catalog ( @xmath99 ) is listed in table  [ matchsum ] . the mean probability for the 442 primary counterparts ( excluding the the four additional likely counterparts ) is then estimated by taking the average of the false - match probabilities of individual catalogs weighted by the number of primary counterparts in each catalog .",
    "the mean false - match probability is @xmath1 , and it represents the identification reliability for the entire x - ray sample ( excluding the the four additional likely counterparts ) .",
    "the mean false - match probability also has slight off - axis angle and source - count dependencies ( due to its relation to the x - ray positional accuracy ) ; e.g. , it is @xmath100 for sources within 4 , @xmath101 at @xmath102 , @xmath103 for sources with @xmath104 full - band counts , and @xmath105 for @xmath106 full - band counts .",

    "the six sources ( xids 93 , 106 , 210 , 280 , 344 , and 353 ) detected at a level of @xmath28 and without identifications could be spurious x - ray detections .",
    "visual inspection indicates that most of these sources appear only marginally above the background . at a detection threshold of @xmath28",
    ", we conservatively estimated that there are @xmath249 false detections ( see  3.2 of l08 ) , and the true number is likely @xmath03 times less ( @xcite ) .",
    "spurious detections could also exist in the identified source sample because of chance correlations .",
    "we estimate that the average possibility of matching a randomly placed @xmath28 x - ray source to an onir source is @xmath250 , using the same bootstrapping technique described in  [ results ] .",
    "significance level .",
    "the false - match probability is higher than that for the entire x - ray sample ( @xmath1 ) , mainly because the positional uncertainties of these x - ray sources are relatively larger . ]",
    "if the six unidentified x - ray sources are indeed spurious , we expect less than one [ @xmath251 spurious x - ray source in our identified source sample . therefore , there are up to @xmath115 spurious x - ray detections , six unidentified and one falsely identified .",
    "this number is roughly consistent with the expected value ( @xmath03 times less than 18 ) .",
    "if any of these six low - significance and unidentified sources is a real x - ray detection , it could have a similar nature as sources 49 and 345 .",
    "besides the unidentified x - ray sources , uncertainties are still present for the 442 identified sources ( excluding the four additional likely cases ) , as there is a @xmath1 false - match probability and there are 21 primary counterparts from the musyc or simple catalogs with relatively less - accurate ( 0.20.3 ) positions . in order to characterize the nature of all the x - ray sources in the @xmath0 ms cdf - s ,",
    "efforts should focus on obtaining ( _ a _ ) better positions for the counterparts and ( _ b _ ) a lower overall false - match probability .",
    "better counterpart positions generally require deeper optical or nir observations . comparing the current deepest optical ( goods - s @xmath42-band ) and nir ( music @xmath21-band ) catalogs",
    ", we consider the nir band to be probably the most beneficial to push deeper , because of its higher counterpart recovery rate , x  o fraction , and lower false - match probability ( see table  [ matchsum ] ) at the current depth .",
    "deep _ hst _",
    "wfc3/ir surveys or the forthcoming _ james webb space telescope _",
    "( _ jwst _ ) will provide unprecedented nir / ir data for source identification .",
    "note that a deeper optical or nir catalog will generally result in a larger false - match probability .",
    "there are at least two possible approaches toward a smaller overall false - match probability : deeper observations and deeper radio observations .",
    "the probability distribution of angular separations , @xmath58 , is largely controlled by the positional errors ( see eq .",
    "2 ) except when matching to the ir sources . additional x - ray observations will improve the positional accuracy and thus reduce the false - match probability .",
    "for example , as the @xmath0 ms cdf - s is scheduled to be expanded to @xmath173 ms , the factor of @xmath0 increase in counts will reduce the areas of source positional error regions by @xmath123 on average , reducing the number of spurious matches ( at the current flux limit ) by about this same factor . the vla radio catalog has the highest fraction ( @xmath88 ) and lowest false - match probability ( see table  [ matchsum ] ) .",
    "however , it also has the lowest counterpart recovery rate ( @xmath126 ) . to examine",
    "if the high x  o fraction of the radio catalog is intrinsic or rather just related to the low recovery rate ( i.e. , limited catalog depth ) , we compared it to the x  o fractions of optical and nir catalogs at similar effective depth .",
    "we limit the goods - s @xmath42-band catalog and music @xmath21-band catalog to brighter magnitudes ( @xmath252 and @xmath253 ) until the recovery rates of these two catalogs are the same as that of the radio catalog ( @xmath126 ) .",
    "the resulting x - o fractions are only @xmath254 and @xmath205 for these two catalogs , respectively .",
    "this suggests the x - ray sources are more strongly associated with the radio sources than optical or nir sources at the current depth of the radio catalog , and thus deeper radio observations might well provide more reliable matches than the goods - s or music catalogs .",
    "the current radio catalog has a 5  @xmath40 limiting flux of @xmath255jy . given the vla 1.4 ghz number counts estimated in @xcite , there will be @xmath256 times more radio sources at a flux limit of @xmath257jy .",
    "this radio source density ( about 30 sources arcmin@xmath15 ) is still @xmath04 times smaller than those of the optical and nir catalogs , and we expect that such deeper radio catalogs can provide more reliable matches and thus reduce the overall false - match probability .",
    "the flux limit of @xmath257jy can be easily achieved by facilities such as the expanded very large array ( evla ) . the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) at shorter wavelengths",
    "may also help with the goal of obtaining more reliable counterparts in a similar way .",
    "1 .   we presented multiwavelength identifications of the 462 x - ray sources in the main _ chandra _  source catalog for the @xmath0  ms cdf - s .",
    "the optical  to  radio catalogs used for source matching include the wfi @xmath39-band , goods - s @xmath42-band , gems @xmath42-band , music @xmath21-band , musyc @xmath21-band , simple 3.6 @xmath50 m , and vla 1.4 ghz catalogs .",
    "the matching results are combined to create lists of primary and secondary counterparts .",
    "we identified reliable counterparts for 442 ( 95.7% ) of the x - ray sources , with an expected false - match probability of @xmath1 ; these are the best identifications for sources at these x - ray fluxes .",
    "we also associated four additional likely counterparts given their small positional offsets to the relevant x - ray sources .",
    "the likelihood - ratio method was used for source matching , which significantly reduces the probability at faint magnitudes compared to the matching method .",
    "for example , the probabilities at @xmath258 are @xmath126 and @xmath88 for the likelihood - ratio and error - circle methods , respectively .",
    "the resulting matches may differ by @xmath126 for sources with @xmath116 , where we expect to find some of the most interesting objects in the deep x - ray surveys .",
    "the likelihood - ratio matching technique can also generate multiple counterpart candidates and calculate their relative reliability parameters , which are useful when considering multiwavelength identifications .",
    "3 .   among the optical  to ",
    "radio multiwavelength catalogs used for identification , the probabilities range from @xmath59% , and the counterpart recovery rates range from . given the current depths of the catalogs , the nir catalogs ( e.g. , the music @xmath21-band catalog ) can provide a large fraction of the counterparts for the x - ray sources with a relatively low false - match probability .",
    "meanwhile , the radio catalog can provide the most secure counterparts with almost no spurious matches . even after limiting the optical / nir catalogs to similar effective depth as the radio catalog",
    ", the radio sources still have a significantly stronger association with the x - ray sources ( measured by the x  o fraction parameter ) .",
    "therefore , obtaining deeper radio observations will considerably benefit the matching reliability .",
    "additional x - ray observations will reduce the x - ray positional errors and thus also improve the identification reliability .",
    "4 .   of the 16 unidentified x - ray sources , eight are probably related to a star ( one source ) , galaxy groups and clusters ( four sources ) , off - nuclear sources ( two sources ) , or any of a number of galaxies at the edge of the field ( one source ) .",
    "another six sources detected at a wavdetect false - positive threshold of @xmath28 may be spurious x - ray detections .",
    "the remaining two objects are likely genuine x - ray sources .",
    "their x - ray  to  optical properties are comparable to the exos , though without any ir or nir detections .",
    "they are likely to be agns at very high redshifts ( @xmath176 ) , or one of them ( source 345 ) could be an isolated neutron star .",
    "we constructed a photometric catalog for the 446 identified x - ray sources including up to 42 bands of data .",
    "we performed source deblending carefully for @xmath2 of the sources in the ir bands and a few percent in the optical and nir bands , obtaining the best - ever photometric data for these sources .",
    "photo - z s were then derived using the zebra sed fitting code and a set of 265 galaxy , agn , and galaxy / agn hybrid templates .",
    "the zebra training procedure corrects the sed templates to best represent the seds of real sources at different redshifts , which reduces template mismatches and improves the photo - z accuracy .",
    "catalogs of photometric data and photo - z s are provided .",
    "we collected secure spec - z s for 220 of the x - ray sources .",
    "it appears that the majority of the x - ray sources without spec - z s are agns at relatively high redshifts ( @xmath2594 ) .",
    "the photo - z s are extremely accurate for sources with spec - z s .",
    "there are only 3 outliers out of 220 sources , and the photo - z s are accurate to within @xmath260 ( @xmath192 ) .",
    "we performed blind tests to derive a more realistic estimate of the overall photo - z accuracy for sources without spec - z s .",
    "we expect there are @xmath6 outliers for the @xmath211 relatively brighter sources ( @xmath7 ) , and the outlier fraction will increase to @xmath825% for the @xmath211 fainter sources ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the typical photo - z accuracy is @xmath2407% ( @xmath192 ) .",
    "the outlier fraction and accuracy do not appear to have a redshift dependence ( for ) .",
