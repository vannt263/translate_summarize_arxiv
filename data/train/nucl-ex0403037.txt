    "event - by - event fluctuations of mean @xmath0 have been proposed as a possible probe to search for the phase transition , especially the qcd critical point via their non - monotonic variation with control parameters such as beam energy and centrality  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the fluctuations can be used to evaluate the extent of thermal equilibrium by comparison with the extrapolated fluctuations from nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "suppressed net charge fluctuations have been proposed as a possible signal for the formation of a qgp , due to the smaller charge units of deconfined ( anti- ) quarks compared to those of confined hadrons  @xcite .",
    "comparisons with cascade models may clarify whether the observed fluctuations are described by resonance gas models .",
    "a detailed description of ceres experiment at the cern - sps can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "for the present analysis , momenta of charged particle tracks produced in pb+au collisions at 40 , 80 , and 158 agev / c have been measured with a cylindrical time projection chamber .",
    "the data set comprises a wide range of collision centrality .",
    "the acceptance of the tpc is around mid - rapidity ( @xmath1 ) and covers @xmath2 in azimuth ( at 40  agev / c only @xmath3 , see also  @xcite ) .",
    "two measures are used to evaluate mean @xmath0 fluctuations . the @xmath4 measures the dynamical fluctuation normalized with mean @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "this measure is proportional to mean covariance of all charged particle pairs per event  @xcite .",
    "another measure @xmath5  @xcite is defined as a deviation from 1 of the ratio of the r.m.s .  of the event - by - event mean @xmath0 distribution in real events to that in mixed events .",
    "the @xmath5 is approximately proportional to @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the mean charged particle multiplicity in the acceptance . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fluc - deta ] , @xmath4 has a saturation tendency at the pseudo - rapidity interval ( @xmath8 ) more than 0.4 , whereas @xmath5 steadily increases .",
    "we therefore use @xmath4 to compare ceres results ( @xmath9 ) with rhic results ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "[ fig : sdyns ] shows @xmath4 as a function of nucleon - nucleon center of mass energy ( @xmath11 ) at @xmath12 and @xmath13  gev / c in 6.5  % central events , compared to rhic data at @xmath14  gev  @xcite , and @xmath15 gev  @xcite . for comparison to rhic data ,",
    "the ceres data are not corrected for short range momentum correlations .",
    "the observed fluctuations at sps and at rhic are similarly about 1  % .",
    "no indication for non - monotonic variation or enhanced fluctuations is observed .",
    "note that a predicted fluctuation at the critical point is @xmath16%  @xcite , far above the measured values .",
    "[ fig : fptcent ] shows fluctuations corrected for short range momentum correlations at 158 agev / c as a function of the number of participants ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the fluctuations between the minimum - bias data set and the central data set are consistent . as a baseline ( dashed lines ) reflecting the superposition of individual nucleon - nucleon collisions , we employ the formula @xmath18 , where the 12  % is a measured fluctuation in p+p collisions at isr  @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath19 in the ceres acceptance .",
    "significant deviations from the baseline are observed in semi - central events , whereas in peripheral events ( centrality @xmath20 ) and in central events ( centrality @xmath21 ) , the fluctuations are consistent with the baseline .",
    "the maximum of @xmath5 is about 2.8  % at @xmath17 of @xmath22 , corresponding to @xmath23 central events .",
    "the observed centrality dependence as well as the increase of @xmath5 with the upper @xmath0 cut is similar to the observations by na49  @xcite , phenix  @xcite , and star  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fptmpt ] , @xmath5 of rqmd and urqmd without rescattering is consistent with the baseline as expected .",
    "with rescattering , rqmd reproduces qualitatively both the non - monotonic dependence of fluctuations and the increasing tendency of mean @xmath0 , while urqmd fails to describe both observables .",
    "as a measure of net charge fluctuations , we use @xmath24 , representing dynamical fluctuations of the difference between normalized multiplicity of positive particles and that of negative particles  @xcite .",
    "the measure is advantageous since the correction for the global charge conservation is additive , and no efficiency correction is necessary .",
    "[ fig : nvdyn ] shows @xmath24 multiplied with mean charged particle multiplicity within the acceptance ( @xmath7 ) as a function of @xmath17 at the three beam energies .",
    "the dashed lines show the charge conservation limit , defined as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the total charged particle multiplicity which is assumed to scale with @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath26 is estimated based on the na49 measurements  @xcite .",
    "the observed fluctuations are lower than the charge conservation limit .",
    "since the fluctuations are much above the qgp model predictions of @xmath27  @xcite , no indication for the formation of a deconfined phase is found .",
    "decreasing tendencies of @xmath28 with @xmath17 are observed at the three beam energies . whether this is due to a deviation of the charge conservation limit from the multiplicity scaling , or due to a real deviation of the fluctuations from the multiplicity scaling , is under investigation .",
    "[ fig : vdyns ] shows , as a function of @xmath11 , a compilation of ceres , star  @xcite , and phenix results  @xcite for @xmath24 corrected for charge conservation ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "a decrease of @xmath29 is observed at sps energies , while a decrease is tiny from sps top energy to rhic energies .",
    "both rqmd and urqmd are in reasonable agreement with the ceres data .",
    "dynamical mean @xmath0 fluctuations of @xmath30  % in central events are observed , which are similar to the fluctuations measured at rhic .",
    "the @xmath5 shows non - monotonic centrality dependence with a maximum of @xmath31  % in semi - central events , which is about a factor of 2 enhanced over the p+p extrapolation . a similar tendency is observed also by na49 , phenix , and star .",
    "rqmd qualitatively reproduces both enhancement of fluctuations in semi - central events and increase of mean @xmath0 as a function of centrality .    the observed dynamical net charge fluctuations are smaller than the charge conservation limit .",
    "the @xmath28 slightly decreases from peripheral to central events . the @xmath29 decreases at sps energies but varies little from the sps top energy to rhic energies .",
    "urqmd and rqmd reproduce the observed fluctuations at sps .",
