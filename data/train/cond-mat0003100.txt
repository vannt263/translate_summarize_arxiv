    "<S> we present and discuss the results of measurements of the @xmath0-plane resistivity of la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 single crystals with small sr contents ( @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resistivity was obtained in the temperature range between @xmath5 and @xmath6 by using an ac van der pauw technique . </S>",
    "<S> when the temperature is lowered , the @xmath7 curves show a transition from a linear behaviour to a semiconducting - like one . </S>",
    "<S> the deviation from the linearity occurs at a doping - dependent temperature @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> this effect can be interpreted as due to a progressive pinning of preexistent charge stripes . in the same framework , </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of anomalous sharp peaks in the @xmath7 curves of superconducting samples just above @xmath9 may be explained by a transition from a _ </S>",
    "<S> nematic _ to a more ordered _ </S>",
    "<S> smectic _ electronic stripe phase .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the most debated features of doped perovskites is the segregation of the charge carriers in one - dimensional domains , called stripes , observed both in some superconducting samples ( i.e. bi@xmath10sr@xmath10cacu@xmath10o@xmath11 @xcite ) and more recently in non - superconducting samples @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this charge segregation is often invoked to explain the local survival of the antiferromagnetic order typical of the undoped compounds , but its correlation with the superconductivity is still a matter of discussion . in the last few years many papers treating this problem appeared in literature , stimulating the experimental search for unquestionable evidences of stripe ordering in high-@xmath9 cuprates .    referring in particular to la@xmath1sr@xmath12cuo@xmath13 ( lsco ) and the related compound la@xmath14nd@xmath15sr@xmath12cuo@xmath13 obtained by nd substitution , neutron diffraction and nqr experiments @xcite allowed to determine the temperatures of charge and spin ordering for various sr doping contents . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite a signature of the charge ordering is identified in the deviation of the @xmath16 curve from the linearity which occurs at a temperature @xmath8 . in principle , each phase transition of the stripes involving a change in the transport properties should leave a mark on the resistivity . </S>",
    "<S> actually , if the metallic character of the stripes @xcite is accepted , they would be observable by means of resistivity measurements only when the amplitude of their fluctuations is sufficiently small on the measurement time scale , that is when they are at least partially localized or `` pinned '' @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath8 should be better referred to as a `` stripe localization '' temperature .    in the case of la@xmath17nd@xmath18sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> , it can be argued that the substitution of some la atoms with nd stabilizes the low - temperature tetragonal phase ( ltt ) , which favours the stripe pinning , instead of the low - temperature orthorhombic phase ( lto ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the occurrence of the lto @xmath19 ltt transition at about @xmath20 , besides leaving a clear kink on the resistivity curves , gives rise to the pinning of preexistent stripes making the @xmath16 curve acquire a semiconducting - like behaviour .    </S>",
    "<S> actually , a similar transition from a metallic - like to a semiconducting - like trend is also found in the @xmath0-plane resistivity of nd - free samples with sr contents @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xcite . in these cases , however , a different stripe pinning mechanism is expected , due to the presence of impurities or to an intrinsic feature of la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 .    in this paper , we report the results of measurements of the @xmath0-plane resistivity @xmath7 of strongly underdoped lsco crystals ( ) between 4.2 and 300  k. the behaviour of the measured @xmath23 is then discussed in terms of three mechanisms following one another at the lowering of the temperature : stripe localization , stripe pinning and a possible stripe phase transition .    </S>",
    "<S> platelet - like lsco single crystals with mirror - like surfaces and typical size @xmath24 were grown by slowly cooling down a non - stoichiometric melt . </S>",
    "<S> the high quality of the crystals both from the superconductive and the crystallographic point of view was shown by ac susceptibility measurements and x - ray analysis . </S>",
    "<S> energy dispersion spectroscopy ( eds ) microprobe analysis was used to determine the resulting chemical composition of the samples , whose homogeneity was tested by comparing the results of `` single - point '' analyses made in different regions of each crystal .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-plane resistivity was obtained by using an ac version of the standard four - probe van der pauw technique . </S>",
    "<S> four good electrical contacts were obtained by evaporating au on the cleaved surface of each crystal , and then by submitting the samples to an annealing process at about @xmath25 for 10 min in air . </S>",
    "<S> thin gold wires were then soldered to the contacts by using ag conductive paint . </S>",
    "<S> two of the leads were used to inject into the samples alternating currents of @xmath26 at @xmath27 , while the remaining two were connected to a lock - in amplifier . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-plane resistivity was obtained by suitably averaging the results of _ four _ resistance measurements .    </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f:1](a ) shows the resulting @xmath7 curves for samples with @xmath28 ( curve  _ a _ ) , 0.06 ( curve  _ b _ ) and 0.075 ( curve  _ c _ ) . crystals with @xmath28 do not undergo a superconducting transition ; instead , their resistivity shows a steep growth as the temperature is lowered , in a typical semiconducting - like fashion . </S>",
    "<S> however , an evident well - reproducible anomalous maximum followed by a dip is observed at a temperature of about @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> we reserve to give a detailed discussion of these features in a future paper .        </S>",
    "<S> [ f:1 ]    samples with @xmath30 and @xmath31 have instead a superconducting behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> the transition of the crystals with @xmath30 occurs at a critical temperature ( evaluated at the midpoint of the transition ) @xmath32 and has a broadening @xmath33 . for the crystals having @xmath31 the analogous quantities are @xmath34 and @xmath35 . as shown more clearly in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f:1](b ) , in both these cases the resistivity shows a sharp anomalous peak of width @xmath36 at a temperature @xmath37 about @xmath38 greater than the respective @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> incidentally , no anomalies are present in the ac susceptibility curves of the same samples .    before giving an interpretation to the observed behaviours of the @xmath0-plane resistivity curves , it is worthwhile to mention and confute some possible objections to the results obtained .    </S>",
    "<S> first , one could wonder if the peaks in curves _ b _ and _ c _ of fig .  [ f:1](b ) could be produced by some inaccuracy in the measurement or by an intrinsic systematic error due to the application of the van der pauw method . </S>",
    "<S> however , these curves are very reproducible and the experimental errors are not greater than the thickness of the lines . moreover , the anomalous peak is present and well recognizable in _ all _ the resistance vs. temperature curves ( with more than 2000 points each ) which have been averaged to obtain the @xmath0-plane resistivity as required by the van der pauw measurement technique , and therefore it is not likely to be an artifact introduced by inhomogeneities in the samples .    </S>",
    "<S> another possible objection is that the peaks in the curves _ b _ and _ c _ could be due to the contribution of semiconducting - like , non - superconducting regions of the sample . to check whether this is the case , </S>",
    "<S> we removed from the measured in - plane resistivity given by curves _ b _ and _ c _ of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f:1](b ) the contribution of non - superconducting regions of different size , representing low - doping islands whose @xmath39 is given by curve  _ a _ of the same figure . </S>",
    "<S> the results reported in fig .  [ f:2](a ) for various non - superconducting volume percentage show that there s no way to cancel the anomalous peak above @xmath9 .        </S>",
    "<S> [ f:2 ]    finally , one could argue that a contribution of the @xmath40-axis resistivity @xmath41 ( which increases rapidly as @xmath42 ) could affect the measured @xmath23 giving rise to a peak such as that observed . </S>",
    "<S> actually , it is important to note that : i ) @xmath41 is , at low temperatures , about 8000 times @xmath23 @xcite ; ii ) because of the annealing process , the gold electrodes deeply penetrate into our samples , thus connecting several consecutive _ ab _ planes . </S>",
    "<S> if there were no inhomogeneities in the crystal , the current would only flow along these @xmath0 planes disregarding the _ </S>",
    "<S> c_-axis paths . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , a @xmath40-axis contribution is expected only in the presence of inhomogeneities in the @xmath0 planes . in order to analyze what happens in this case </S>",
    "<S> , we numerically calculated the equivalent resistance of a resistor network , in which each elementary cell represents the unit volume of the crystal ( with vertical and horizontal resistances numerically equal respectively to the measured @xmath41 and @xmath23 of our samples after the removal of the anomalous peak from @xmath23 ) , by assigning to a certain number of horizontal resistor the non - superconducting @xmath43 given by curve  _ a _ in fig  [ f:1](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the results , shown in fig .  [ f:2](b ) for increasing non - superconducting volume percentage , indicate that the @xmath40-axis contribution can strongly modify the shape of the @xmath44 curve , but is unable to create very sharp peaks as those observed in our measurements .    </S>",
    "<S> we can now discuss in detail the results shown in fig  [ f:1](a ) and ( b ) . in the range </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-plane resistivity of all the crystals considered has an almost perfectly linear temperature dependence . </S>",
    "<S> we then perform a linear fit with a curve of the form which yields the best - fit parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 . with these values </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the normalized @xmath0-plane resistivity @xmath47 in the _ whole _ temperature range , from 4.2 up to 300@xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting curves for the superconducting samples are plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f:3 ] .        </S>",
    "<S> [ f:3 ]    as previously anticipated , in a recent paper ichikawa _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite noted that the stripe localization temperature @xmath8 ( previously determined by nqr @xcite ) of la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 single crystals with @xmath22 and @xmath49 marks the point at which the corresponding @xmath0-plane resistivity deviates from the high - temperature linear behaviour of an amount that depends on the sr concentration . </S>",
    "<S> in such a way , they defined threshold values for the deviation from linearity , which allow in principle to determine @xmath8 once known @xmath7 . supported by their work , we extrapolated the threshold vs. @xmath50 curve given in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite to the sr contents of our interest : @xmath28 , 0.06 and 0.075 ( see the inset of fig .  [ f:3 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the extrapolation procedure is based on the fact that , for small @xmath50 , the threshold must tend to 1 and on a somehow arbitrary choice for the extrapolating function . by using b - spline functions we determined the smoothest curve that connects the straight line passing for the points deduced from ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( solid triangles in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f:3 ] ) to the horizontal line of equation @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the threshold value . to do so </S>",
    "<S> , we used as an additional point the intersection between these two straight lines , and we put to 1 the threshold at @xmath53 by using the fact that , for these doping contents , the material is an antiferromagnetic insulator . </S>",
    "<S> the thresholds determined in such a way for our sr concentrations are reported as open squares in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f:3 ] together with the thresholds for nd - doped crystals reported in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( solid squares ) . </S>",
    "<S> the point at which the normalized resistivity crosses the threshold determines the `` stripe localization '' temperature @xmath8 for each doping concentration . </S>",
    "<S> the crossing points for @xmath30 and @xmath31 are reported in the main graph of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f:3 ] ( solid circles ) . </S>",
    "<S> the charge stripe localization temperatures @xmath8 are then plotted as a function of the sr content in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f:4 ] ( solid squares ) together with the data ( open squares ) obtained by nqr measurements on la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 crystals with various doping contents @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there s a _ very good agreement _ between the two data sets , which seems to indicate that the procedure described so far is essentially correct .    as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f:3 ] , when the temperature is lowered below @xmath8 the normalized @xmath23 increases , until the superconducting transition sets on . </S>",
    "<S> the upturn of the curve can be related to a progressive slowing down of the stripe fluctuations , i.e. to an increase of the pinning efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> actually , the problem arises of determining what is the mechanism responsible for the stripe pinning , since there is no nd substitution nor evidences of a structural lattice transition which would perhaps result in a kink in the @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that , in the strongly underdoped crystals we analyzed , the stripe pinning is `` intrinsic '' , in the sense that it is related to the very low density of doped holes ( @xmath54 holes per cu site ) .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now focus our attention on the narrow peaks observed in the superconducting samples ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) at @xmath37 ( solid triangles in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f:4 ] ) just above @xmath9 ( open diamonds ) . </S>",
    "<S> a possible explanation for these anomalies could be the occurrence of a _ structural _ lattice transition , of the same kind of that observed in nd - substituted samples at higher temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> actually , to our knowledge there are no other kinds of experiments supporting the occurrence of such a transition near @xmath9 in la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we think these peaks could be due to an _ electronic _ transition to a more ordered stripe phase . </S>",
    "<S> this argument is based on ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , in which a detailed scenario of successive electronic phase transitions is depicted . </S>",
    "<S> as suggested by the schematic phase diagram reported there , a _ </S>",
    "<S> nematic _ to _ smectic _ phase transition just above the critical temperature is allowed in the case of underdoped ( but obviously superconducting ) copper - oxides . </S>",
    "<S> such a transition is not in conflict with the stripe localization argument exposed above . when the _ progressive _ intrinsic pinning of the stripes begins , it is possible that transverse stripe fluctuations are sufficiently violent to preserve the full translational invariance , destroying the rotational symmetry , as in the _ nematic _ stripe phase @xcite . at the lowering of the temperature , transverse fluctuations decrease and </S>",
    "<S> the stripes can undergo the transition to a _ </S>",
    "<S> smectic _ </S>",
    "<S> phase , or rather to a `` stripe glass '' , which is in fact a slightly disordered version of the smectic phase  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of observing the mark of an electronic phase transition on the resistivity is also supported by experimental analogies with the behaviour of some metal dichalcogenides at the charge density wave transition @xcite . there , clear kinks very similar to the features present in our data were observed in the @xmath7 curves .        [ f:4 ]    the interpretation of the anomalous peaks at @xmath37 exposed above is also consistent with the coexistence of cluster spin - glass ( csg ) and superconductivity recently observed below  @xmath55 in lsco with @xmath30 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , as predicted by the general theory of coupled order parameters , a spin order can appear only when the charge order is already well developed , i.e. at a lower temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature of stripe ordering we determined here ( @xmath56 k ) is , as expected , greater than the temperature at which the csg phase appears ( @xmath57 ) .    in conclusion , we interpret the main features of the @xmath0-plane resistivity of strongly underdoped la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 crystals as a function of the temperature within the framework of the stripe phase transitions . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the deviation from the linearity of the normalized @xmath7 curves allow obtaining the temperature of stripe localization @xmath8 . at the lowering of the temperature below @xmath8 </S>",
    "<S> , we hypothesize that an intrinsic stripe pinning mechanism due to the very low sr content of our samples becomes dominant giving rise to the upturn of the @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we propose to explain the anomalous narrow peaks above @xmath9 as due to a nematic to smectic electronic phase transition of the stripes . </S>"
