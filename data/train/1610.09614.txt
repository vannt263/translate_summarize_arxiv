    "nowadays , we know from observations that our universe is experiencing an accelerated expansion phase , with some unknown mechanism @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite . a mysterious fluid with negative pressure",
    "dubbed dark energy is the most important candidate where can drive this acceleration @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the cosmological constant , @xmath0 , is the simplest dark energy component despite of the related coincidence problem @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "also , we know that the universe underwent a phase transition during its evolution . at this era it has changed its decelerated expansion to an accelerated phase .",
    "thus , the so called deceleration parameter , @xmath1 , switches from positive to negative values for a specific value of redshift called transition redshift , @xmath2 .",
    "besides , we expect the redshift of any cosmological source change after a time interval because of the evolution and expansion of the universe .",
    "although this redshift drift is small and could not be measure at low redshifts , it is the unique way to determine the expansion history of the universe , directly and without any defaults @xcite,@xcite .",
    "observationally , we can express this change in redshift as a spectroscopic velocity drift of the source which is in order of several cm s@xmath3 yr@xmath3 .",
    "on the other hand , in the past two decades the theory of extra dimensions has attracted a great deal of attention between researchers @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "it thrived by braneworld scenario of randall and sundrum ( rs ) and developed gradually . among many extensions of rs model ,",
    "the model proposed by dvali , gabadadze and porrati ( dgp ) is of particular interest , because one branch of this model explains the certain late - time acceleration of the universe without any dark energy component , irrespective of its own problems . in dgp braneworld model ,",
    "our 4d world is a brane embedded in an infinite 5d minkowskian bulk .",
    "also , all the matter fields are confined to the brane and only gravity can leakage into the bulk . according to the two ways that brane can be embedded in the bulk , the model features two separate branches denoted by @xmath4 , with distinct characteristics .",
    "the @xmath5 branch is called the self - accelerating solution in which the universe experiences a late - time acceleration due to modification of gravity . on the other hand the @xmath6 branch where is not able to accelerate without a dark energy component",
    "is called the normal branch @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we study the @xmath0dgp model , i.e. , a spatially non - flat dgp model in the presence of a cosmological constant as a dark energy component .",
    "we express the transition redshift in terms of our model parameters via @xmath7 and then estimate it numerically , using a best - fitting procedure .",
    "section iii , deals with the redshift drift and drift velocity . in this section",
    "we test our model with observations .",
    "also , in each case we compare our results with the @xmath0cdm model . in section iv",
    ", a statefinder diagnostic procedure is used to distinguish our model among different dark energy models . in section",
    "v , the important coincidence problem is investigated in our model .",
    "section vi includes conclusion and remarks .",
    "as we mentioned in introduction our universe has experienced a transition from a decelerated expansion to an accelerated one , in its expanding history .",
    "the redshift of this transition is called transition redshift , @xmath2 , which is one of the important parameters in cosmology . in this section",
    "we are trying to obtain this value directly , using a numeric approach in non - flat @xmath0dgp model . to this aim ,",
    "we start by friedmann equation and after calculating the related deceleration parameter , we use the condition @xmath7 , to obtain an expression for @xmath2 , in terms of our model parameters .",
    "then , considering @xmath2 , as a free parameter , a best - fitting procedure is used to determine the best values of model parameters . using these values we plot the curves @xmath1 and ( @xmath8 ) , for the model under consideration and compare them with @xmath0cdm model",
    "also , we can compare the curve ( @xmath8 ) , with the observational constraints from planck satellite .    in non - flat @xmath0dgp model",
    "we have the following modified friedmann equation on the brane @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , are the hubble parameter , scale factor , the 4d planck mass and the so called crossover distance , respectively .",
    "also , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is related to the matter content on the brane and @xmath16 .",
    "also , @xmath17 , is the curvature parameter . using the fractional energy densities as @xmath18 one can rewrite the friedmann equation as below @xmath19 here , @xmath20 and",
    "the zero index means the present value of any cosmological parameters .",
    "the deceleration parameter , @xmath21 , in terms of redshift is defined as @xmath22 so , it can be rewritten in terms of fractional energy densities as @xmath23 and the transition redshift can be expressed as @xmath24 one can check that this expression is exactly similar to the one obtained in a flat @xmath0dgp model .",
    "now , we use the numeric @xmath25 method to obtain the best - fitted values of our model parameters . to this aim",
    "we have utilized the observational data from type ia supernova ( sneia ) , baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) and cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) . to constrain our model parameters with attention to sneia",
    ", we use 557 data points belong to the union sample @xcite .",
    "the related @xmath25 value is defined as @xmath26 ^ 2}{\\sigma_i^2}.\\ ] ] here , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the theoretical and observational values of distance modulus parameter , respectively and @xmath29 shows the observational estimated error .",
    "the distance modulus is the difference between the absolute and apparent magnitude of a distant object and is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32km / s / mpc and @xmath33 is called the luminosity distance .",
    "furthermore , we can constrain our model free parameters using the definition of bao distance @xmath34^{1/3}.\\ ] ] to this aim we use the joint analysis of the 2df galaxy redshift survey at @xmath35 and sdss data at @xmath36 @xcite,@xcite as the bao distance ratio which is model independent @xmath37 the related @xmath25 value can be obtained using @xmath38 ^ 2}{0.065 ^ 2}\\cdot\\ ] ] the cmb shift parameter , @xmath39 , @xcite,@xcite which defines as @xmath40 contains the major observational information from cmb .",
    "thus to take into account the contribution of cmb in our analysis we use the @xmath25 below @xmath41 ^ 2}{\\sigma_r^2},\\ ] ] where @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "now , minimizing @xmath43 , we obtain the best - fit values of our model parameters .",
    "also , in this procedure we have considered @xmath2 , as a free parameter .",
    "the results have been shown in table [ table:1 ] . in comparison with the corresponding transition redshift of @xmath0cdm model , @xmath44 @xcite , in non - flat @xmath0dgp model the universe starts its accelerated expansion phase , earlier .",
    "note that the value of @xmath45 , has been obtained indirectly , using the best - fitted values of other model parameters , together with the relation ( [ zt2 ] ) .",
    ".best - fitted values of non - flat @xmath0dgp model parameters [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ table:1 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : q ] , the deceleration parameter as a function of redshift for best - fitted values , has been drawn with a dash curve in black . in fig .",
    "[ fig : zt ] , we have indicated transition redshift , @xmath2 , as a function of @xmath46 . also , the observational data for @xmath2 and @xmath46 , extracted from planck satellite , have been shown by horizontal and vertical lines , respectively .",
    "it seems that , this model fits observations , well .",
    "cdm model and non - flat @xmath0dgp model for the best - fitted values of our model parameters .",
    "the curve and the value of @xmath2 , of two models are very similar to each other , but our model switches deceleration to acceleration a little earlier than @xmath0cdm model.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    , for @xmath0cdm model and non - flat @xmath0dgp model for the best - fitted values of our model parameters .",
    "the horizontal and vertical blue lines are related to observations .",
    "the planck satellite results in 68% confidence limit on the present matter density parameter is @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "the best - fit value of the transition redshift and corresponding 68% confidence limit , with attention to some observational data , has been obtained in @xcite , using a parameterized deceleration parameter as @xmath48 .",
    "both models are in good agreement with observations.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "the cosmic redshift parameter is related to the scale factor , @xmath49 and consequently to the cosmic time , @xmath50 , indirectly .",
    "then , we conclude that the redshift changes with time , as well .",
    "the variation of redshift with respect to time , called redshift drift , can be used to measure the variation of hubble parameter , @xmath51 and also the acceleration of the universe , directly . according to @xcite ,",
    "if we introduce @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively as the time in which a signal is detected in the frame of observer and the time in which the signal is emitted from the source , then @xmath54 and one can reach to mcvittie equation @xmath55 the appearance of a difference in the value of @xmath56 , in ( [ zdot ] ) , is the reason that we can consider the redshift drift as a criterion of acceleration of the universe .",
    "also , using the best - fitted values in table [ table:1 ] and with attention to mcvittie equation , we can plot the curve @xmath57 and deal with the expansion history of the universe .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : qzdot ] ) . we should note here that recently , the forecasting analysis , using the redshift drift has attracted a great deal of attention .",
    "it has been shown in a number of works that the mock redshift drift data can significantly improve the constraints on model parameters @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "using some calculations one can reach to relation below @xmath58 where we have shown derivative with respect to @xmath59 , by the prime .",
    "also , from ( [ mc ] ) , we can obtain @xmath60 with attention to ( [ slope ] ) , in the diagram @xmath57 , the slope of the curve is negative , if @xmath61 and is positive , if @xmath62 . also",
    ", the extremum point is related to @xmath63 .",
    "analyzing equations ( [ mc ] ) , ( [ qzdot ] ) and ( [ slope ] ) and with attention to fig . [ fig : qzdot ] , one can find that during decelerated expansion , @xmath64 changes from negative to positive values .",
    "then , starting the accelerating phase it turns and approach zero at the present and continues to negative values in the future .",
    "furthermore , as it has been shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qzdot ] , that @xmath65 , changes from negative to positive , as well in decelerating phase .",
    "but during accelerated expansion , it extends to the larger positive values .    ,",
    "@xmath64 and @xmath65 , as a function of redshift in non - flat @xmath0dgp model for the best - fitted values of our model parameters.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in a universe filled only with matter component , the expansion is slowing down because of the effect of gravity . but today , we know from observations that our universe at an epoch in its expansion history has started to accelerate where ensures the existence of a dark energy component with negative pressure . in terms of dimensionless density parameters of dark matter , @xmath66 and dark energy , @xmath67 , this epoch is related to the redshift @xmath68 , in which @xmath69 .",
    "this redshift differs from @xmath2 , in which the universe starts its acceleration .",
    "the comparison between these two values is another interesting object in cosmology .",
    "the corresponding value of @xmath68 , which can be obtained from @xcite , shows @xmath70 , for @xmath0cdm model . in non - flat @xmath0dgp model and for simplicity",
    "we use new variables @xmath71 . then , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the condition @xmath74 , leads to an expression for @xmath68 , in terms of our model parameters as @xmath75 using table [ table:1 ] , we obtain @xmath76 , in our model which is larger than the corresponding value in @xmath0cdm model .",
    "but , similar to the @xmath0cdm model , @xmath77 .",
    "thus , without need to domination of dark energy component the universe can start its accelerating expansion phase .    besides , we know from observations that the velocity of a light source changes with respect to @xmath52 , though this variation is very small .",
    "it is just in order of a few cm s@xmath3 , if we consider a time interval about 30 years .",

    "to distinguish and classify different dark energy models , a few approach have been proposed . among them ,",
    "the statefinder diagnostic is of particular interest .",

    "these two new variables define as    @xmath80    also , they can be rewritten in terms of the equation of state parameter , @xmath81 , and its first derivative with respect to time @xcite , as @xmath82 so , for the @xmath0cdm model , with @xmath83 , we have @xmath84 .",
    "the pair @xmath85 , has been utilized frequently in the literature to discriminate a wide variety of dark energy models @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "to this aim one can compare the corresponding trajectories in @xmath86 plane .",
    "moreover , deviation from the fixed point @xmath87 , related to the @xmath0cdm model can be studied using these curves .",
    "[ fig : rs ] , illustrates the trajectories belong to @xmath0dgp model .",
    "the range of change of statefinder parameters , specially @xmath88 , is very small , as it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : rands ] , which means that our model has a tiny departure from @xmath0cdm model .",

    "one of the most important problems of @xmath0cdm model is coincidence problem , namely , why the energy densities of dark matter and dark energy are of precisely the same order today ? in another words if we introduce @xmath91 then , the coincidence problem asks why @xmath39 , is of order unity now ?",
    "many scenarios have been proposed to solve or at least alleviate this problem .",
    "for instance , some dynamical dark energy models have been put forward to replace the cosmological constant @xcite,@xcite .",
