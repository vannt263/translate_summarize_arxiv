    "the accurate measure of the time delay between the two images of the gravitationally lensed quasar q0957 + 561 ( kundi _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) leads , in principle , to a measure of h@xmath0  accurate to a few percent ( refsdal 1964 ) .",
    "this accuracy in h@xmath0  is achievable only when the gravitational potential @xmath6 of the lens ( or , equivalently , its surface mass distribution @xmath7 ) is also determined to an accuracy of a few percent . at present , uncertainties in the lens model dominate the uncertainty in h@xmath0 . the goal of this paper is to determine which , if any , models for the lens are consistent with the many observational constraints on this system , and to thence find the range of h@xmath0  values implied by the family of acceptable lens models .    a number of authors have investigated mass models for @xmath8 over the 20 years since its discovery .",
    "gorenstein , falco , & shapiro ( 1988a ; followed by falco , gorenstein , & shapiro 1991 , hereafter fgs ) pointed out that any lens model constrained by the positions or magnifications of lensed objects are subject to a `` mass sheet degeneracy . ''",
    "if a mass distribution @xmath9 successfully reproduces the lensing behavior , then an altered model with mass distribution @xmath10 will have identical optical characteristics yet yield a value for h@xmath0differing by a factor @xmath11 .",
    "since the primary lensing galaxy g1 is the brightest member of a modest galaxy cluster , we fully expect there to be a dark matter component which is slowly varying across the region of multiple imaging .",
    "the lens modeling process can hence be broken into two fairly distinct problems : first , we must determine a `` strong lensing model '' which prescribes a mass distribution @xmath12 , over the central @xmath13 region , that accurately reproduces the observed strongly distorted or multiply imaged sources in this area .",
    "second , we must find a way to measure the average mass density across the strong - lensing area or otherwise find the proper @xmath11 scaling for @xmath12 ( and hence h@xmath0 ) .",
    "the primary focus of this paper is to investigate several broad classes of candidate mass distributions for the g1-cluster system , and find what range of h@xmath0  is produced by those which satisfy the observational constraints on the lens . in  [ constraints ] we delineate these constraints , which are now more extensive than available to grogin & narayan ( 1996 , hereafter gn ) . in  [ models ] we describe the parametric models of the mass distribution which we will use to fit the strong - lensing constraints , and the _ a priori _ constraints we impose on these models in order to keep them `` astrophysically reasonable . '' in  [ fits ] we present the results of the fits , including the best - fit models and the range of h@xmath0  allowed _ before _ application of the @xmath11 correction .",
    " [ constraints][fits ] are somewhat involved , and many readers may wish to skip through to the end of  [ fits ] for a summary of the model - fitting results . in  [ weak ] we use the weak - lensing measurements of fischer _",

    "[ improve ] we discuss the possibilities for improvement in the constraints on h@xmath0  that we derive . in ",
    "[ conclusion ] we conclude .",
    "the @xmath8 system has been observed in detail at wavelengths from radio to x - ray , and displays a rich variety of lensed features .",
    "we discuss here the numerical constraints that these observations place upon models of the lens optics .",
    "table  [ tconstr ] summarizes the constraints we have adopted for our modeling .",

    ". we will adopt their positions and consider them to be known exactly .",
    "the requirement of a common source position for the a and b quasar images places two ( exact ) constraints on the lens model . in our modeling procedure ,",
    "these are solved by adjusting the two components of external shear ( see  [ methods ] ) .",
    "the wfpc2 observations of bernstein _ et al . _",
    "( 1997 , hereafter paper ii ) showed that the optical quasar separation agrees with the vlbi separation to the measurement precision of a few milli - arcseconds .",
    "paper ii also shows that the optical peak and centroid of g1 coincide with the vlbi point source g@xmath34 ( gorenstein _ et al . _",
    "1988b ) to within 10  mas .",
    "we will therefore adopt the vlbi position of g@xmath34 as the center of g1 , and consider its 1  mas uncertainty to be negligible .",
    "we adopt the g@xmath34 position as the center of our mass distributions , so the g1 center does not appear as an adjustable parameter in our models .",
    "we will henceforth measure all object positions in a coordinate system centered on g@xmath34 , with @xmath35 axis pointing west and @xmath36 axis north ( j2000 ) , with units of arcseconds unless otherwise specified .",
    "position angles will be measured counter - clockwise from the @xmath35-axis , 90  different from the astronomical north - through - east convention .",
    "the most detailed images to date of the vlbi jets extending from the a and b quasars are given by garrett _",
    "( 1994 ) , and are re - analyzed by barkana _",
    "( 1998 , hereafter blfgks ) .",
    "both authors fit to each jet a model containing a core and five additional gaussian jet components ( a2a6 , b2b6 ) .",
    "a proper lens model should map each of these 5 pairs of objects to common sources .",
    "each of these papers derives a local transformation which maps the a jet positions and fluxes into their b counterparts . to simultaneously fit the positional constraints and the flux magnification constraints ( see the next section ) , it is necessary to allow this map to be more complex than a linear transformation .",
    "both papers fit a model in which the relative magnification matrix is allowed to vary in a limited fashion along the jet ( _ e.g. _ the magnification eigenvectors are fixed but the eigenvalues vary along the jet ) .",
    "we have , therefore , two choices in implementing the jet constraints in our models .",
    "we can either fit to some or all of the jet positions and fluxes directly , or we can fit by trying to match the 6 derived parameters that describe the local behavior of the relative magnification matrix .",
    "we choose the former method for two reasons .",
    "first , computing the gradient of the local magnification matrix would require computing complicated ratios of third derivatives of the model potential , which would slow our numerical methods substantially .",
    "second , to reduce the behavior of the local magnification matrix to 6 parameters , garret _",
    "_  and blfgks assume that the eigenvectors of the magnification do not vary with position . this may not be the case for our model lenses , and it is not clear how , in this case , we should implement a fit to the parameters of a fixed - eigenvector model .",
    "fitting directly to the jet component positions could add 10 constraints to our model , but in fact most of this information is redundant for any realistic model ( flux ratio constraints are discussed below ) .",
    "the jet components lie nearly along a line , and their positions are consistent with a constant relative magnification matrix between the a and b images .",
    "the nearly - linear arrangement of the sources further means that only two components of the relative magnification matrix are well constrained .",
    "we can therefore extract nearly all the useful information from the jet components by considering only the brightest and best - measured pair , a5 and b5 .",
    "we will use the positions from the `` partial fit '' of blfgks ( their table  2 ) , for which in fact all the jet positions are forced to map smoothly from a to b.    the positions of components a5 and b5 are determined to high precision , with formal uncertainties of only @xmath37  mas , or 0.2% of their displacements from the quasar cores . for the reasons outlined in appendix  [ jets ]",
    ", we believe that the use of such small uncertainties may be unjustified and/or could constrain the @xmath38 minimum to a misleadingly narrow region of parameter space . when fitting models , we give the models more freedom by widening the error ellipse for each jet component to be a circle with radius equal to 1% of the jet s displacement from the quasar cores .",
    "in actuality we find that the models do not require this additional freedom : retaining the original blfgks error estimates changes the minimum @xmath38 by @xmath39 and changes the h@xmath0  bounds by @xmath40 .",
    "determination of the flux ratios between the a and b images is confounded by three effects : first , small sources can vary on time scales comparable to the 1.1-year time delay .",
    "second , the quasar continuum source is likely small enough to be microlensed by stars in g1 , which can cause decades - long perturbations to the flux ratio . third , connor _",
    "( 1992 ) argue that the flux ratio varies significantly along the jet , as the core is closer to the lensing caustic than the jets .",
    "garrett _ et al .",
    "_  ( 1994 ) summarize the various constraints on flux ratios .",
    "the components of the jet should be large enough to be free of microlensing and temporal variation problems .",
    "their measured flux ratio for b5/a5 combined with the previous independent vlbi jet flux ratio measurements give a flux ratio of @xmath41 at the position of jet component 5 .",
    "we also know ( from the jet images ) that there must be a parity flip between images a and b.    measuring the flux ratio at the core is more difficult because microlensing and time variation are likely .",
    "et al . _  ( 1994 ) cite several attempts to measure the core flux ratio in the radio by interpolating observations at different epochs and/or frequencies to make up for the 1.1-year time delay .",
    "all of these , however , are imprecise or used a time delay value now excluded by the data . schild & smith ( 1991 ) measured broad - line fluxes from the two quasars at two epochs 1.1  years apart .",
    "the line flux originates from a region believed large enough to be unaffected by microlensing , and the two epochs serve to remove any source variability .",
    "they report a flux ratio of @xmath42 .",
    "spectrophotometric observations such as this are subject to many systematic difficulties , and the quoted errors encompass only counting statistics , so we will be conservative and double the quoted uncertainty on this value .",
    "more recently haarsma _ et al . _",
    "( 1999 ) estimate a core flux ratio from a long vla time series .",
    "the vla does not resolve the core from the jets , but if one presumes that the jets are invariant on decade time scales , then the ratio of _ fluctuations _ in the a and b fluxes ( when phased by the time delay ) , gives a magnification ratio for the ( varying ) core flux only .",
    "the core radio continuum source is believed to be large enough to avoid microlensing amplification .",
    "analyses of different frequencies and subsets of the data yield flux ratios from 0.72 to 0.76 ; we will therefore adopt @xmath43 as the core flux ratio , which is consistent with all optical and vla measurements .",
    "most recently blfgks derive core and jet  5 flux ratios of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively , from their `` partial fit '' to the positions and fluxes of the vlbi jets .",
    "this is comfortingly consistent with the values we have adopted from other sources ( though the data upon which the jet flux ratio is based is the same as the garrett _",
    "et al . _",
    "data ) .",
    "paper ii gives the positions and fluxes of a number of faint objects discovered in the strong - lensing region in wfpc2 images .",
    "three resolved objects , `` blob 2 , '' `` blob3 , '' and an apparent arc , are close enough to g1 to expect that they are multiply imaged .",
    "the arc contains two bright spots , a pattern which suggest that these `` knots '' sit astride the critical line and are multiple images of a bright spot in the source .",
    "we adopt the positions and uncertainties of knots 1 and 2 given in paper ii .",
    "in addition , we demand that knots 1 and 2 have opposite parities , and that their flux ratio be @xmath46 , in accord with the ( poorly ) determined magnitudes from paper ii .",
    "this adds 3 constraints to the model .",
    "we also enforce the qualitative constraint that a model must `` fold '' the source of the arc back over on itself , _",
    "i.e. _ we expect that the arc is a greatly magnified image of a small source , rather than an image of some intrinsically very elongated source . in practice",
    "this qualitative constraint forces the g1 matter distribution to have a position angle ( pa ) roughly aligned with the visible galaxy rather than perpendicular to it ( see  [ fits ] ) .",
    "this conclusion is in line with that of keeton , kochanek , & falco ( 1998 ) , who find that the application of isothermal ellipsoid mass models to 17 well - measured lens systems yeilds a position angle within @xmath47 of the visible @xmath48 in nearly all cases .",
    "any reasonable model for the lens shows that the sources of blobs 2 and 3 could be quite close to each other .",
    "it is also clear that if either source is at a redshift @xmath49 , then a counterimage should be visible .",
    "the only candidate counterimage for blob 2 is blob 3 , and vice - versa , so there seems to be little risk in assuming these two objects to be images of the same source .",
    "we adopt this constraint in our models , using the positions and uncertainties from paper ii .",
    "we also constrain the flux ratio of blob 2 to blob 3 to be @xmath50 .",
    "this implies a @xmath51  mag difference between the blobs , which differs a bit from the @xmath52  mag difference in table  2 of paper ii .",
    "we have revised our estimate of the magnitude of blob  3 by 0.3  mag .",
    "the revision reflects a changed estimate of the local sky value , which is difficult to evaluate due to residual flux from the quasar and g1 images .",
    "the magnification ratio will change rapidly across the extent of the blobs , so their observed flux ratio is actually an integral of the magnification ratio across the extent of the source .",
    "such a calculation is impractical for our models ( the shape of the source is not well known anyway ) , so our constraint is only upon the magnification ratio at the object centroids .",
    "for this reason the uncertainty on the magnification ratio used to constrain the model is higher ( 0.3  mag ) than the stated measurement uncertainties on the relative flux ( 0.14  mag ) . with",
    "improved s / n on the images of the blobs it should be possible to produce more specific constraints ( and better object names ) .",
    "the two multiply - imaged systems provide 3 constraints each ( 2 position , 1 flux ) to the model .",
    "there are , however , two additional degrees of freedom which are introduced , namely the redshifts of the arc and blob source objects .",
    "if we leave these source redshifts as free parameters in the model fits described below , we find the best fits have the arc and blob sources both very close to the quasar in redshift .",
    "( 1997 ) obtain the same result , though blfgks differ .",
    "furthermore , the arc and blob sources are separated by only a few tenths of an arcsecond in the source plane in these models .",
    "this strongly suggests that ( a ) the arc is a highly magnified double image of an extension of the blob source that crosses a caustic , and hence the arc and blob have common redshift ; ( b ) the arc / blob source object is at the quasar redshift .",
    "the _ a priori _ most likely distance for the arc and blob sources is of course near the quasar , since quasars are found in large galaxies and since galaxies are clustered in space .",
    "more evidence that the arc and blob sources are at the quasar redshift is given by a recent hst / nicmos @xmath53-band image of this system ( kochanek _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) , which shows a spectacular pair of arcs surrounding each quasar image , presumably the images of the quasar host galaxy .",
    "the wfpc2 @xmath54-band blobs 2 and 3 and arc all lie within the envelope of the nicmos arcs .",
    "it thus seems extremely likely that the blob and wfpc2 arc sources are `` hot spots , '' bright in rest - frame uv , within or associated with the quasar host galaxy .",
    "we will therefore assume a common redshift for all these sources .        among the many interesting features revealed in the wealth of imaging of the @xmath8 system",
    "are extended arc - like structures seen in nicmos near - ir images ( kochanek _ et al . _",
    "1998 ) , in high - s / n radio imaging ( harvanek _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ; porcas _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 , avruch _",
    "et al . _",
    "1997 ) , and perhaps even in x - ray images ( jones _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 , chartas _",
    "1995 ) ; it is difficult to incorporate this information into our lens models unless the images have sufficiently high s / n and resolution that one can identify a correspondence between multiply imaged features in the surface - brightness maps .",
    "the x - ray `` arcs '' are a marginal detection and not yet useful as lens model constraints .",
    "avruch _ et al .",
    "_  ( 1997 ) demonstrate that the vla arc can be adequately reproduced by judicious placement of sources .",
    "other features of the vla and merlin maps are similar in that they can be reproduced qualitatively by proper source placement in all our models , so they do not add information to our current modeling .",
    "ongoing improvements in the radio maps , coupled with some type of clean or maximum entropy reconstruction algorithm for lenses ( _ e.g. _ wallington _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 , ellithorpe _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) or other software for modeling diffuse sources , will certainly be of use in testing and limiting the lens models .",
    "the nicmos images are , at this writing , preliminary and may perhaps yield quite useful constraints if sufficient s / n can be achieved .",
    "et al . _  ( 1998 ) state that the direction of extension of the a and b arcs are sufficient to rule out the gn model .",
    "vla images of the system ( greenfield _ et al .",
    "_ 1985 ) show extended jets ( labelled c , d , and e ) extending several arcseconds from the a quasar .",
    "the absence of jet images about the b quasar could be used as a model constraint . in all of our models ,",
    "the source regions for the c , d , and e jets are either singly imaged , or perhaps have highly demagnified images leading from b toward the center of g1 .",
    "et al . _  ( 1997 ) may have detected a counterimage of a low - surface - brightness extension of the e jet , but the resolution is as yet too poor to yield much information .      the failure to detect a third quasar image is not a useful constraint on our models . as noted in paper ii , the stellar light density of g1 continues a power - law increase toward the center , as do all other observed elliptical galaxies ( gebhardt _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) . for surface - density power laws with exponents near the isothermal value of @xmath55 , the third image will be absent or highly demagnified .",
    "the third image is also easily `` captured '' by a star and further demagnified .",
    "the properties of the third image might constrain the mass distribution in the central 01 of g1 , but this mass has little effect on h@xmath0 .",
    "high - accuracy measurements of the stellar velocity dispersion of g1 are presented by tonry & franx ( 1998 ; see also falco _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) . while the velocity dispersion of g1 may be used to break the mass - sheet degeneracy (  [ weak ] ) , we mention here a different use . over a range of @xmath56 from the center of g1 , tonry & franx",
    "detect a change of @xmath57 in the velocity dispersion . given their good seeing ( 07 ) and the sharp central cusp in the g1 luminosity profile ( paper ii ) , this measurement shows that the velocity dispersion of g1 is nearly constant over a range 13  in projected radius .",
    "thus the radial mass profile of g1 is nearly isothermal , @xmath58 in the notation of equation  ( [ ellip1 ] ) below .",
    "a full consideration of the constraints imposed by this measurement is beyond the scope of this paper  see romanowsky & kochanek ( 1998 ) for the significant steps toward constraining the g1 mass with stellar velocity data .",
    "we will , however , assume the very crude and conservative constraint that the power - law index of the projected g1 mass density at @xmath59 radius satisfies @xmath60 . in a naive interpretation ( _ i.e. _ spherically symmetric galaxy with isotropic velocities ) , a mass index at these upper or lower limits would lead to a 30% rise or fall ( 100  km  s@xmath61 ) in velocity dispersion in the data of tonry & franx , which can clearly be excluded .",
    "the weak lensing mass map in paper i shows the peak of the cluster mass distribution located to the northeast of g1 .",
    "this displacement is only marginally significant ( @xmath62 ) ; one can not from this data alone exclude the possibility that the cluster is centered on g1 .",
    "paper i also shows that the light distribution of the cluster galaxies is peaked to the ne of g1 , though again not at high significance . in",
    "what follows we will find further evidence from the strong - lensing models that the cluster mass peaks in the ne or sw quadrant .",
    "we believe that the concurrence of these three weak , but independent , lines of evidence is sufficient to apply a constraint that the cluster mass density be increasing to the ne quadrant of g1 .",

    ", we should permit @xmath111 more freedom between a and b. we will implement this by investigating models in which the power law breaks at some position between @xmath105 and @xmath106 ( adding 2 degrees of freedom to even the simple circularly symmetric case ) .",
    "a glance forward to figure  [ profiles ] shows that these simplified assertions on freedom in the radial profiles are borne out by the detailed modelling .",
    "the wfpc2 objects ( paper ii ) should be of great help in constraining h@xmath0  because they fall at several different radii between @xmath105 and @xmath106 , and hence help `` tie down '' the behavior of @xmath111 between the two quasars .",

    "the potential @xmath6 and its derivatives are linear in many of the lens parameters , such as the g1 normalization @xmath131 and the shear parameters @xmath118 and @xmath117",
    ". the equations expressing the constraint that two images have a common source are linear in the derivatives of @xmath6 , and hence in these linear model parameters as well .",

    "simulated annealing is particularly useful for finding the global minimum of a function which may have many local minima . for a given model we repeat the asa search twenty or so times with different random number seeds in a further effort to sample the full phase space for global minima . with more than a few dimensions to search , asa can become slow to converge on the bottom of a given `` valley '' in the merit function .",
    "we therefore use the output of asa as the starting point for an optimization using the downhill - simplex program subplex ( rowan 1990 ) . thus the simulated annealing is used in a global search for regions of low @xmath38 , and the downhill simplex",

    "the visible @xmath48 does collapse the arc but raises the overall @xmath38 to 55 . in either case g1",

    "[ ccenter ] , paper i gives two weak , but independent , lines of evidence that the cluster center lies to the northeast of g1 . both the _ weak lensing mass map _ and the _ peak galaxy density _ are ne of g1 at marginal significance . in addition , all of the best - fit strong - lensing models orient the _ principal axis of the shear _ ( c2 term ) in the range @xmath254 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath176 of the shear is 0.10.2 , much too large to be due to large - scale structure along the line of sight , and a strong sign that the cluster is in fact _ not _ centered on g1 .",
    "this implies that the cluster is centered either toward the ne or the sw of g1 .",
    "each of these measurements is , alone , weak evidence for a cluster center to the ne , but they are all completely independent , so taken together they make a more persuasive argument . since the cluster gradient direction @xmath172 should point roughly toward the cluster center , even for elliptical or slightly irregular cluster masses , we should prefer the @xmath249 solution over the other two . in what follows",
    "we will examine the h@xmath0  allowed for @xmath255 .",
    "if @xmath172 is left free , the allowed h@xmath0  range is substantially wider .    before we calculate constraints on @xmath93 ,",
    "let us examine the nature of this successful model for the lens mass .",
    "since this is the simplest mass model which yields a good fit to the observations , we will refer to it as the `` best fit model . ''",
    "the parameters of the successful models are listed in table  [ tc3s ] .",
    "the g1 mass is again somewhat shallower than isothermal at @xmath256 and , at @xmath257 , is about as flattened as the outermost isophotes of g1 ( paper ii ) .",
    "the @xmath258 differs significantly from the orientation of the isophotes , which twist from 135  to 150  ( paper ii ) .",
    "the agreement between mass model shape and isophote shape is not perfect , but is plausible .",
    "the @xmath259 misalignment between mass and isophotes is only slightly larger than the typical 10  misalignment found in the models of 17 lenses by keeton , kochanek , & falco ( 1998 ) .",
    "[ tc3s ]    the external shear axis is @xmath260 while the third derivative term has axis @xmath261 . the 30  misalignment is well within the range attributable to an elliptical or irregular cluster shape .",
    "the amplitudes of the shear and third derivative are all reasonable given the measured @xmath262 of the cluster at g1 ( see  [ weak ] ) .",
    "the image and source plane geometries for this model are shown in figure  [ caustics ] .",
    "as discussed earlier , the source for the arc is quite close to the source for blobs 2 and 3 , and the arc is part of a 4-image system with additional images adjacent to blobs 2 and 3 .",
    "the source for the arc is compact and `` folded '' back upon itself as we expected .",
    "the source of the knots lies just inside the inner caustic of the lens .",
    "the quasar source lies inside the outer caustic ; the vla jet sources are outside the caustics and are only singly imaged .",
    "the third image of the quasar appears 140 times fainter than b , even without a `` capture '' by a star .",
    "this model is an excellent fit to the observations and not astrophysically peculiar in any way .    with a good model in hand",
    "we now can proceed to bound the acceptable range in @xmath93 . with @xmath172",
    "restricted to the ne quadrant , the best - fit model has @xmath263 and the widest range within the 95% cl bounds ( @xmath264 for 4 dof ) is @xmath265 .",
    "the parameters which extremize @xmath93 are listed in table  [ tc3s ] .",
    "the highest value for @xmath93 requires a g1 ellipticity set to the _ a priori _ upper bound of @xmath212 ( axis ratio 2:1 ) . removing this restriction results in an upper bound on @xmath93 only 0.3% higher ( at @xmath266 ) , so the upper limit on h@xmath0  is not really set by the 2:1 axis ratio criterion .    the search for minimal @xmath93 yields a model with g1 orientation of @xmath267 , which causes the arc source to be `` unfolded . ''",
    "enforcing @xmath268 ( g1 pa in ne quadrant ) gives a marginally acceptable arc source , as illustrated in figure  [ arcs ] .",
    "this is admittedly a qualitative judgment . in most of what follows , the models which define the lower bound on @xmath93",
    "have the same problem of a poor arc source , and we implement the g1 @xmath48 restriction to enforce a compact arc source .",
    "we explore the sensitivity of the allowable @xmath93 range to the details of the cluster third derivatives by changing the restrictions in equation  ( [ c3sis ] ) that relate the third - derivative cluster terms .",
    "we discover that _ our results are insensitive to the relations assumed among the third - derivative terms . _",
    "this means that our results should be robust to ellipticity or irregularity in the shape of the cluster dark matter .",
    "we first set @xmath269 .",
    "the best - fit model has @xmath270 ( @xmath271 ) , with a 95% cl range ( @xmath272 ) of @xmath273 .",
    "this is nearly identical to the @xmath93 range for the previous model ( c3s+dm1 ) .",
    "next we set @xmath274 .",
    "the best - fit model has @xmath275 ( @xmath276 ) , with a 95% cl range ( @xmath272 ) of @xmath277 ( assuming @xmath172 in the ne quadrant ) .",
    "adding the @xmath174 term ( @xmath173 ) yields a somewhat better fit than does the @xmath278 ( @xmath171 ) term .",
    "but adding _ either _ term to the lens model vastly improves the fit over the quadratic - order cluster models . without these c3 terms , all of the lensing potential has even-@xmath279 symmetry about g1 .",
    "it seems that the key to a satisfactory fit is an odd-@xmath279 term to break the inversion symmetry in the potential",
    ".    we can give the cluster more freedom by allowing all four parameters of the third - order cluster potential to be free , leaving 2 dof for the fit . a marginally acceptable fit",
    "is attainable ( @xmath280 ) , and models within the 95% cl level ( @xmath281 ) produce @xmath282 .    to summarize , varying the restrictions on the cluster third derivatives does not substantially alter the range of h@xmath0  compatible with the observations . among all c3s+dm1 and c3+dm1 models ,",
    "the time delay is limited to @xmath283 , assuming that the cluster gradient runs to the ne quadrant .",
    "stellar mass is certainly present in g1 so we would like to find good lens models incorporating the ml terms . indeed",
    "a fit with @xmath284 ( @xmath248 ) is found , with @xmath285 .",
    "it is comforting that the best - fit value of the mass - traces - light component is quite close to that expected from the stellar population .",
    "furthermore , inclusion of the stellar mass component has not degraded the quality of the fit from the simpler `` best fit '' model of  [ c3sdm1]but it _ does _ yield a substantially lower time delay at @xmath286 ( table  [ tc3s ] ) .",
    "the dm1 `` halo '' component is very shallow ( @xmath287 ) and elliptical ( @xmath212 at @xmath239 ) when the ml term is included .",
    "because the ml term has a strong central mass peak , the dark matter power - law index becomes shallow and the derived @xmath93 is lowered .",
    "the lower limit to @xmath93 is substantially decreased by including the ml terms : @xmath288 is possible at the 95% cl limit of @xmath289 .",
    "this extremal model has the halo index at our _ a priori _ limit of @xmath290 .",
    "shallower values of @xmath130 would produce even lower h@xmath0  values with good fits to the lensing geometry .",
    "addition of a finite core radius to the dark matter ( c3s+ml+core ) results in fits optimized at zero core radius , and no expansion of the allowed range of @xmath93 .",
    "the addition of a black hole constrained to @xmath291 does not qualitatively change the fits .",
    "it does , however , allow @xmath93 values as low as 8.46 within the 95% cl contours ( @xmath292 ) , a 3% reduction in h@xmath0 . for this new extremal model ,",
    "the black hole mass is at its _ a priori _ upper limit , and the dark matter halo is again as shallow as our _ a priori _ limit of @xmath293 allows .",
    "this is the lowest value of @xmath93 found in any of our models , so we refer to this as the `` minimal h@xmath0 '' model .",
    "its parameters are in table  [ tc3s ] and its radial profile is plotted in figure  [ profiles ] .",
    "thus we see that the addition of the centrally concentrated stellar and black - hole masses has _ weakened the lower bound on h@xmath0  by 15% _ , an appreciable change .",
    "the lower bound on h@xmath0  also depends strongly on our _ a priori _",
    "limit on the dark matter radial index : adopting the stricter limit of @xmath294 brings the 95% cl lower limit on @xmath93 back up 7% to 9.10 .",
    "we give g1 substantially more freedom with the dm2 model . with the c3s cluster model we formally have zero degrees of freedom in the fit , but we will judge these models as if they have @xmath234 .",
    "allowing such freedom expands the range of @xmath93 compatible with the lensing constraints .    pushing down the lower bound of @xmath93",
    "we find models with very shallow g1 mass : @xmath295 , @xmath296 , and @xmath297 .",
    "the minimum time delay value within the 95% cl bound of @xmath298 is @xmath299 , another 15% decrease from the lower limit in the previous section .",
    "this model is not , however , astrophysically plausible , because its surface mass density inside @xmath300 is only slightly above the minimum expected from the stellar mass [ _ cf .",
    "_ equation  ( [ ml ] ) ] , and is quite shallow .",
    "the dark matter density would then have to be _ decreasing _ toward the core , which we regard as unlikely .",
    "we can include an ml term with @xmath158 to enforce a density everywhere at least as large as the expected stellar contribution , and require ( as usual ) that the dark matter component increase toward the center .",
    "the model of this type with lowest attainable @xmath93 within the 95% cl contours turns out to be virtually indistinguishable from the lowest-@xmath93 c3s+bh+ml+dm1 model found above . the additional freedom for g1 , therefore ,",
    "does not extend the lower bound on h@xmath0  if we use the stellar mass as a floor for the g1 mass .",
    "the upper bound on @xmath93 is raised to 14.10 by c3s+dm2 models which let g1 break from a nearly - isothermal slope of @xmath301 to a steeper @xmath302 outside of @xmath303 .",
    "this bound is 13% higher than those derived in the previous sections , and is the `` maximal h@xmath0 '' model in our study .",
    "the h@xmath0bound is this time strongly dependent upon our _ a priori _ limit of @xmath304 on the steepness of the g1 profile .",
    "since the tonry & franx ( 1998 ) stellar dynamics measurements only extend to @xmath56 it is not likely that their observations can rule out this mass model . perhaps by comparing with studies of other ellipticals one could exclude this mass distribution for g1 , but for now we are forced to accept this as a valid model .",
    "an extension of the approximation for the cluster potential from quadratic order to cubic order has greatly improved the fit to the observations .",
    "we have seen that the @xmath93 values are not very sensitive to the precise form of the cubic terms , but we would also like to see if our results on h@xmath0  are robust against cluster potential terms beyond cubic order .      we might expect a gentle peak in the cluster mass near g1 to decrease the lower bound on @xmath210 by adding a nearly - constant mass sheet to the vicinity of the quasar images . including the c4p mass term from equation  ( [ cr2 ] ) , however , does not lead to any expansion of the allowed @xmath210 range , and the best - fit models place @xmath305 .",
    "significant values ( @xmath306 ) are strongly excluded by the strong lensing constraints .",
    "we conclude that the cluster mass does not have an important maximum within @xmath181 , in mild disagreement with the weak - lensing analysis of paper  i.      the c4s restricted fourth - order cluster approximation has 6 free parameters (  [ c4s ] ) , so we will combine it with the simplest mass model for g1 , the elliptical power - law dm1 .",
    "more complex models for g1 would leave insufficient degrees of freedom .",
    "we limit the amplitude @xmath185 of the quartic cluster terms to the value they would acquire from a singular isothermal cluster located only 10away from the center of g1 .",
    "larger values than this would make the cluster mass supercritical within the central 10  region , which is clearly not the case .",
    "we also require the quartic terms to point roughly toward the ne , @xmath307 .",
    "the c4s+dm1 model does have an acceptable best fit , with @xmath308 ( @xmath309 ) .",
    "the parameters are similar to those of the best - fit c3s+dm1 model .",
    "the range of time delays attainable within the 95% cl region ( @xmath310 ) are @xmath311 .",
    "recall from  [ c3sdm1 ] that the acceptable range for the c3s+dm1 models was @xmath312 .",
    "so the addition of the fourth - order cluster terms does not improve the quality of the fit to the observations , and permits an extension of the allowed @xmath93 ( and hence h@xmath0 ) range of only + 4% or -2% , a small fraction of the total allowed range .",
    "unless the cluster mass has strong features on scales of @xmath313 or less , further terms in the power - law expansion of the cluster potential should have even smaller effects on lens models .",
    "thus we can conclude that , given the current set of lensing constraints , the cubic approximation to the cluster is necessary and sufficient for the purposes of placing bounds on h@xmath0 .",
    "we summarize here the properties of the various lens models we have tested against the observations .",
    "* it is not possible to fit the observed lensing geometry with astrophysically reasonable models that use the quadratic ( c2 ) approximation to the cluster potential .",
    "all such models , with up to 12 free parameters , are excluded at @xmath314 confidence .",
    "there is good agreement among various authors on the parameters of the best - fitting simple models , though it is clear that the real lens is not as simple as these models . *",
    "allowing third - order terms in the expansion of the cluster ( c3s ) potential permits a good fit to the data , even with a single power - law galaxy ( dm1 ) .",
    "the best - fit c3s+dm1 model has @xmath315 , a level which occurs by chance with 20% probability . for this simplest , `` best fit '' model , @xmath316 . * the fit is insensitive to the details of our restrictions on the cluster third - order terms ; a good fit generally seems to need some term that breaks the inversion symmetry of the lens .",
    "* c3+dm1 and c3s+dm1 models with a range @xmath317 are consistent with the observations at 95% cl . *",
    "inclusion of _",
    "cluster terms neither improves the fit nor significantly widens the allowable @xmath93 range .",
    "* equally good fits to the data are also available when we include a mass term that traces the light density .",
    "the best - fitting models have mass - to - light normalization @xmath318 , where @xmath158 is what we expect from the stellar population .",
    "this agreement is reassuring . *",
    "while inclusion of the stellar mass is not required to fit the lensing geometry , it does yield significantly lower values of @xmath93 within the 95% cl .",
    "the same is true , to a lesser extent , of a central black hole of mass @xmath319 .",
    "the `` minimal h@xmath0 '' c3s+bh+ml+dm1 model pushes the lower bound on @xmath93 to 8.46 . * allowing the g1 power law to break to a steeper value @xmath320 between the quasars ( `` maximal h@xmath0 '' c3s+dm2 model ) raises the _ upper _ bound on @xmath93 to 14.10 .",
    "thus the best - fit simple model gives @xmath316 , with a 95% cl range of @xmath321 .",
    "combining with equation  ( [ dt4 ] ) , we have @xmath322 we end up , therefore , with a @xmath323 uncertainty in h@xmath0  from the lens modeling alone .",
    "there is additional uncertainty in @xmath324 , as discussed in the next section .",
    "had we studied only the simplest model that fit the data ( c3s+dm1 ) , we would have derived a 95% cl range of smaller than @xmath325 .",
    "the additional complexity of the bh , ml , and dm2 terms did not significantly improve the quality of the best fit , but it does more than double the allowed range of h@xmath0 . since these additional terms are astrophysically reasonable , we have no alternative but to consider the more complex models as yielding valid estimates of h@xmath0 .    to what extent does the result in equation  ( [ h0a ] ) depend upon our _ a priori _ limitations on the lens mass distribution ?",
    "the best - fit model , fortunately , does not place any of the model parameters at the _ a priori _ bounds .",
    "the extremal models , however , place the radial power - law index @xmath130 of the g1 dark matter distribution at its _ a priori _ limits .",
    "the lowest - h@xmath0model , of type c3s+bh+ml+dm1 , has @xmath290 , and the highest - h@xmath0model ( c3s+dm2 ) has @xmath320 outside of @xmath326 .",
    "the bounds on h@xmath0  thus are strongly dependent on our assumptions about a `` reasonable '' galaxy profile might be . assuming @xmath294 , for example",
    ", raises our lower bound on h@xmath0  by 7% , removing one third of the error bar .",
    "the lowest - h@xmath0  model also has the black hole mass at its _ a priori _ upper limit of @xmath327 .",
    "a larger value is unlikely , however , and only weakly affects the h@xmath0  bound .",
    "we reiterate as well that we have assumed that the cluster mass gradient points toward the northeast quadrant from g1 . relaxing this constraint",
    "would significantly widen the allowed h@xmath0  range .",
    "figure  [ profiles ] shows how the radial mass profile is the most important determinant of h@xmath0 .",
    "we plot the deflection angle @xmath328 vs @xmath88 , where @xmath329 is the mass enclosed within a circle of radius @xmath88 centered on g1 .",
    "an isothermal profile is flat in this representation , while a shallower radial mass profile yields an upward slope .",
    "we see that the shallower the mass profile between the two quasars , the lower the h@xmath0  value implied .",
    "all the valid models cross at a point intermediate to @xmath330 and @xmath331 , since the sum of the deflections angles at @xmath330 and @xmath331 must of course equal the 6  separation between them , as discussed in  [ circsym ] .",
    "the inclusion of cluster terms beyond quadratic order dramatically improved the agreement between our lens models and the observed geometry .",
    "the models of gn , fgs , and 4 of the 5 blfgks models have only a quadratic cluster , which explains why we have found a lower @xmath38 value for essentially the same constraints .",
    "the fifth model of blfgks , `` fgse+cl , '' includes an elliptical softened - core isothermal g1 _ and _ a singular isothermal sphere galaxy cluster .",
    "the velocity dispersion and position of the sis cluster are free parameters , and the cluster potential is exact , not a quadratic approximation . yet",
    "the best - fit @xmath38 is 41 for 7 dof , highly excluded .",
    "our c3s+dm1 model fits the data much better ",
    "at first glance it might be because we have relaxed the constraint on the position of jet 5 , but in fact we obtain an equally good fit using the error bar on the jet 5 position given by blfgks .",
    "the main reason for the improved fit is that we have _ not _ required that the cluster have an sis profile .",
    "indeed the best - fitting model has @xmath332 but @xmath249 , meaning that the second and third derivatives of the cluster potential are not aligned , and hence the cluster is not spherical .",
    "furthermore , we have @xmath333 and @xmath334 , whereas an sis cluster would have @xmath335 .",
    "if we take our best - fit c3s+dm1 model and require alignment of @xmath169 with @xmath172 to within 5 , the @xmath38 value rises from 6.0 to 26.7 , strongly excluding the alignment that a spherical cluster would generate .",
    "an singular isothermal _ elliptical _",
    "cluster distribution would require @xmath336 to generate the observed 30  misalignment between the mass gradient and the shear .",
    "we reiterate that our approach of continuing the power - law approximation to the cluster potential means that we do not have to know or fit the global shape of the cluster , just its multipole moments about g1 .",
    "we note that it is possible to _ measure _ the multipole moments about g1 directly from the shear pattern in a weak lensing map ( schneider & bartelmann , 1997 ) .",
    "the apparent departure of the cluster from sis form suggests that it is not safe to infer the @xmath11 factor by assuming that @xmath337 , as is done in producing some of the h@xmath0  estimates in blfgks .",
    "the strong - lensing models for g1 give detailed information on the mass distribution in the giant elliptical galaxy g1 .",
    "all of the acceptable lens models share a few characteristics :    * the dark matter distribution is shallower than isothermal within a radius of @xmath338 .",
    "the c3s+dm1 models place the radial index of the _ total _",
    "g1 mass at @xmath256 .",
    "the stellar light distribution is significantly steeper at @xmath339 , so when we include a mass - traces - light term in the g1 mass , we find that the _ remaining _ mass ( `` dark '' matter ) is forced to significantly shallower values of @xmath340 .",
    "the highest - h@xmath0models have profiles that are nearly isothermal within @xmath341  kpc and significantly steeper beyond this point . *",
    "the total mass surface density is well above the stellar contribution at all projected radii above 01 ( figure  [ profiles ] ) . *",
    "the matter distribution is highly elliptical , @xmath342 ( axis ratio of 1.5:12.0:1 ) , more flattened than the inner isophotes of g1 .",
    "the dark matter halo is oriented at @xmath343 ( measured from east ) whereas the isophotes twist from 135  to 145 .",
    "thus the dark matter is out of alignment by 1545  from the outer isophotes of the galaxy .",
    "both the ellipticity and position angle of the light tend toward the dark matter values at the outer isophotes ( paper ii ) .",
    "with the strong - lensing constraints satisfied , we turn to resolving the sheet - mass degeneracy in these models .",
    "four methods have been used to determine the local density @xmath84 of the galaxy cluster near the g1 center :    1 .",
    "weak - lensing measurements can measure the mean mass density @xmath5 within the region @xmath179 of the g1 center ( paper i ) .",
    "this method has the virtues of being non - parametric , and of measuring precisely the quantity that is needed ( the _ projected _ mass density ) .",
    "the main drawback at the moment is the undesirably large statistical uncertainty in @xmath5 , which we explain below . 2 .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity dispersion @xmath171 ( losvd ) of g1 can be measured , providing an absolute normalization of the g1 mass model and hence breaking the sheet - mass degeneracy .",
    "the virtue of this method is that the measurement is now quite precise , currently yielding a 95% cl uncertainty of @xmath344 on the quantity @xmath345 that scales h@xmath0  ( tonry & franx 1998 ) .",
    "the drawbacks of this method are that , first , the losvd measures a degenerate combination of the g1 mass _ and _ the velocity anisotropy of the stars , hence the mass uncertainty is significantly larger than the @xmath345 measurement error .",
    "romanowsky & kochanek ( 1998 ) show that incorporation of constraints on the higher - order moments of the velocity distribution can reduce the uncertainty on the g1 mass to @xmath346 ( 95% cl ) _ if the three - dimensional structure of g1 potential is known_. the second drawback of the losvd normalization of @xmath11 is that the losvd is sensitive to the _ three - dimensional _ structure of the g1 potential whereas the lensing models constrain and require the _ two - dimensional _ ( projected ) mass density of g1 .",
    "romanowsky & kochanek ( 1998 ) assumed a spherical g1 mass model from gn ; not only do the strong - lensing mass models now require an elliptical projected mass , but the structure along the line of sight is unknown . allowing these additional freedoms in the orbit modeling will not only greatly complicate the interpretation of the losvd data , but would undoubtedly broaden the allowed range of @xmath11 .",
    "the complications of this interpretation lead us to prefer the weak - lensing method .",
    "the surface density implied under the assumption of isotropic orbits does , however , agree well with the weak lensing measurements ( paper i ) .",
    "[ losvd ] 3 .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the galaxies in the g1 cluster can be used to measure the cluster mass density ( garrett _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ; angonin - willaime _",
    "this method unfortunately suffers the difficulties of both methods ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) above : the few known members ( 21 ) of the g1 cluster poorly determine the cluster @xmath345 ; and the conversion of @xmath345 to @xmath11 at the g1 location requires many assumptions about both the three - dimensional shape of the cluster potential and the anisotropies of the galaxy orbits within this potential .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that this method will ever approach the precision of the previous two .",
    "4 .   the properties of the x - ray emitting gas in the cluster potential can be used to normalize a model for its mass ( chartas _ et al .",
    "this too suffers both from very poor s / n on the relevant measured quantities ( x - ray flux , temperature , and core radius ) and in the extensive parameterization and implicit assumptions about the physical conditions of the cluster potential and gas within it ( _ e.g. _ that the cluster is a spherical @xmath347-model with gas in hydrostatic equilibrium ) .",
    "the x - ray data , even with observational improvements , are therefore unlikely ever to provide the best quantitative measure of the sheet mass .",
    "in paper i we use the `` aperture massometry '' formula of fahlman _",
    "( 1994 ) to measure the mean mass density in annuli centered on g1 : @xmath348 this formula gives the average mass density ( in critical units ) inside the inner radius @xmath349 in term of the average tangential shear component of galaxies @xmath350 in some annulus @xmath351 .",
    "the formula is exact in the weak lensing limit ( @xmath352 ) , and the second term on the left - hand side reminds us that we measure @xmath353 only relative to the mean mass density @xmath354 of the measurement annulus .    ideally the data can be used directly in equation  ( [ massometry ] ) to yield the desired @xmath5 at @xmath355 . in practice there are four complications : first , the background galaxies are not fully resolved , and the observed shapes are driven toward the shape of the seeing disk , squelching the lensing signal .",
    "second , the source galaxies are at a variety of redshifts , hence the mean critical density ( and @xmath167 ) may differ by a scaling factor from the value appropriate to the strong - lensing sources at @xmath356 . in paper",
    "i we measure these scaling factors by creating monte - carlo simulations of source galaxies with redshift , shape , and size distributions that match what is known about the true galaxy population .",
    "paper i uses a model of mcleod & rieke ( 1995 ) to estimate a source redshift distribution to @xmath357 in an @xmath358 universe ; the seeing - corrected @xmath167 for this population must be increased by @xmath359 to give the @xmath167 appropriate to the @xmath356 strongly - lensed sources .",
    "this scaling factor is uncertain , we estimate , by @xmath360 , due to our ignorance of the galaxy distribution and cosmic geometry .",
    "since the statistical uncertainty in @xmath167 is much larger ( @xmath361 ) , we will ignore the calibration uncertainties at this juncture .",
    "the third complication in the use of equation  ( [ massometry ] ) is that the lensing is not entirely in the weak limit .",
    "paper i introduces an iterative approach in which the weak - lensing formula is used to make an initial radial profile , which is then used to apply slight corrections to equation  ( [ massometry ] ) to account for stronger lensing near the cluster center . as can be seen from the top panel of figure  6 in paper i , this introduces only a few percent correction to @xmath362 , and the details are not critical here .",
    "the fourth complication is that the data in paper i extend only to @xmath363 , so we must estimate the mean mass density @xmath364 before we get a final @xmath5 .",
    "paper i derives this correction by assuming that the cluster follows an isothermal profile at radii beyond the outer bound of the data .",
    "the second ( annular ) term on the left - hand side , @xmath364 , is 22% of the desired @xmath5 term under this assumption .",
    "in essence we are still subject to a sheet - mass degeneracy , although this time the sheet must be constant across a 168  radius instead of the much smaller strong - lensing region . when smoothed over this much larger circle , the expected @xmath365 from the cluster is far smaller , and thus so is its uncertainty .",
    "we will ignore the uncertainty in this 22% correction , and take the value derived from the isothermal approximation in paper i.    the mean mass density measured from weak lensing can be read from figure  6 in paper i ( where the lower panel incorporates the small correction for departure from weak lensing ) .",
    "correcting to the critical density appropriate for our @xmath356 strong - lensing sources , we obtain @xmath366 this is the 1-sigma random error due to the `` shape noise '' of the intrinsic ellipticities in the finite number of background galaxies .",
    "since the s / n ratio on this quantity is only 3.2 , we can ignore for the time being the calibration errors relating to the source redshift distribution and the mass density beyond @xmath363 .",
    "the weak lensing data thus yield @xmath367 ( 95% cl ) .",
    "note that the fractional error on @xmath11 is smaller than the fractional error on @xmath167 .",
    "this helps the error budget a bit , but the statistical error induced on h@xmath0  is still @xmath368 at the 95% cl .",
    "combining this weak - lensing result with the results of strong - lensing models of equation  ( [ h0a ] ) gives the value of the hubble constant : @xmath369 we caution the reader that the probability distribution for h@xmath0within these bounds is not gaussian ; for example , the best - fitting models span the range 6580 @xmath2 , with all having essentially the same likelihood .",
    "the h@xmath0  from the 0957 time delay derived in equation  ( [ h0b ] ) is disappointingly imprecise , with a @xmath370 95% cl range that encompasses nearly all other current estimates of h@xmath0 .",
    "this uncertainty is due in equal parts to remaining freedom in the strong - lensing model of the g1 mass distribution and to statistical uncertainty in the weak - lensing measurement of @xmath11 ( our weak lensing aperture of @xmath181 was chosen to make this the case ) .",
    "substantial improvement in the precision of the h@xmath0  estimate will therefore require improvements in _ both _ aspects of the problem .",
    "we believe that imminently available data will permit these improvements .",
    "we could set tighter bounds on h@xmath0  if we could independently constrain the mass profile of g1 .",
    "measurements of the losvd ( and other moments of the velocity ) can do this",
    ". the analysis will not be straightforward because of the reasons mentioned in ",
    "[ losvd ] .",
    "deeper imaging of the 0957 lens system could also very easily narrow the @xmath323 modeling uncertainty in h@xmath0 .",
    "the arc and blobs 2 & 3 are images of a common source object .",
    "the wfpc image in paper ii has insufficient s / n to see the morphology of these objects .",
    "a deeper image would allow us to create a precise correspondence between different components of these images , thus further constraining the models .",
    "figure  [ blobsrc ] shows the relative source - plane positions of the arc and blobs in the best - fit and h@xmath0-extremizing models .",
    "we see that a detailed view of where the arc / knot source lies within the blobs could distinguish these models .",
    "deep stis observations of this system obtained in march , 1999 should provide the s / n level required .",
    "we believe it to be quite likely that additional multiply - imaged features will be discovered either in our recent stis observations of 0957 , in the existing nicmos images of the system ( kochanek _ et al . _",
    "1998 ) , or in future radio imaging .",
    "this would help pin down the radial mass profile and decrease the h@xmath0  uncertainty due to the modeling .",
    "the weak - lensing measure of @xmath5 is limited primarily by statistical fluctuations in the shapes of the observed galaxies .",
    "improvement is possible if an image of the field can be obtained with a higher density @xmath371 of resolved galaxies at s / n@xmath372 .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath5 scales as @xmath373 .",
    "the @xmath5 measurement in paper i uses 67 galaxies per square arcmin at @xmath374 , many of which are poorly resolved even in the excellent seeing ( fwhm of 06 ) of the cfht image .",
    "the image is not particularly deep , having been obtained with a front - illuminated ccd ; a higher @xmath371 over a larger field could be obtained with currently - available thinned ccds .",
    "even more promising is the use of the hubble space telescope ; even relatively short ( 3600 s ) exposures with the wfpc2 camera yield arclet densities of @xmath375 ( hoekstra _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) , with essentially all being completely resolved .",
    "a mosaic of deeper wfpc2 images , or , even better , a few images from the upcoming advanced camera imager , would allow a large increase in @xmath371 and hence in the precision of @xmath5 .    improved s / n in the weak lensing data will also help refine the strong lensing model , since the arclets can be used to quantify the multipole moments of the mass distribution both internal and external to the @xmath181 division that we have placed between the weak and strong lensing regions ( schneider & bartelmann 1997 ) .",
    "the present data are not sufficiently accurate to yield useful constraints beyond the monopole moment @xmath5 .",
    "we have pursued the goal of an independent , global , conceptually simple measure of h@xmath0  via the time delay of the gravitational lens 0957 + 561 .",
    "the simplicity is lost , however , as we delve into the messy consideration of realistic models for the mass distribution in the lens . despite the accuracy of the time delay measurement , indeterminacy in the g1 mass model and the cluster mass each",
    "add @xmath323 uncertainty to the value of h@xmath0 , with our final determination being @xmath376@xmath2  ( 95% cl ) .",
    "while the resultant accuracy of our h@xmath0  value is disappointing , the good news is that we have , for the first time , produced a lens model that accurately reproduces the many observed features of this lens .",
    "our investigation of an extensive variety of lens models shows that the g1 lens _ must _ be elliptical and _ must _ be shallower than isothermal , and the surrounding cluster _ must _ be considered in more detail than a constant magnification and shear , and the cluster _ must _ depart from circular symmetry .",
    "the g1 lens mass profile _ can _ be a simple power law , but a much wider range of h@xmath0  values are accessible if we allow the mass profile the freedom to depart from a single power law .",
    "in particular , the inclusion of a mass component that traces the light in g1 , with a m / l ratio as expected from the stellar population , leads to a lowered value of h@xmath0 .",
    "the range of allowed h@xmath0  depends strongly on the _ a priori _ limitations placed upon the g1 mass profile .",
    "constraining the lens with only the two - image system ( quasars and jets ) gives an extremely wide range of possible h@xmath0  values ( kochanek , 1991 ) unless one artificially restricts the g1 mass distribution to circular or isothermal profiles .",
    "the 0957 system now also includes a likely four - image system ( arc & blobs ) at a variety of radii from the g1 center , which reduces the h@xmath0  uncertainty from modelling to @xmath323 under our broad range of possible g1 models .",
    "additional multiply - imaged sources would curtail this freedom substantially .",
    "the mass - sheet degeneracy from the surrounding cluster is broken in a straightforward , non - parametric fashion with the weak lensing data of paper i. improvements to this measurement require only deeper high - resolution images .",
    "losvd measurements of g1 can also break the mass - sheet degeneracy , but this will require dynamical modelling of realistic ( _ e.g. _ elliptical , non - isothermal ) potentials .",
    "we believe that the uncertainties on h@xmath0  from this system will be cut in half within a year or so . but",
    "0957 + 561 is now only one of three gravitational lenses useful for h@xmath0  determination : pg  1115 + 080 ( schechter _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 , barkana 1997 ) and b0218 + 357 ( biggs _ et al . _ 1999 ) both now have accurately determined time delays , and known redshifts for both source and lens galaxies .",
    "resultant values of h@xmath0have already been published for each : @xmath377 ( isothermal lens ) or @xmath378 ( mass - traces - light lens ) for pg1115 ( impey _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) , and @xmath379 for b0218 ( biggs _ et al . _  1999",
    ") , each at 95% cl in the usual units .",
    "while these lenses would seem to offer higher precision on h@xmath0  than the result derived for 0957 in this paper , _ we believe that the claimed precision on h@xmath0  is overestimated _ because the lenses have as yet been modelled only with relatively simple mass distributions  isothermal ellipsoids . while the lens observations may be well fit by these simple models , this does not exclude the possibility that the mass distribution may take other sensible forms . in the case of 0957 , we found the lens well fit by the c3s+dm1 power - law ellipsoid , but the allowed h@xmath0range is much larger when we allow additions such as the mass - traces - light component .",
    "it has been claimed that the 4-image systems such as pg1115 will offer better h@xmath0  constraints than 2-image systems such as 0957 or b0218 .",
    "we have seen , however , that the 0957 model is now constrained by a 2-image _ and _ a 4-image system and still has 20% uncertainty in h@xmath0  from the g1 mass model .",
    "a competitive measure of h@xmath0  will apparently require even more constraint on the lensing geometry . for 0957 + 561",
    ", it is likely that other multiply - imaged background sources will be found in deep images , but this is less likely for the other systems simply because their strong - lensing regions are smaller ( einstein - ring radii of 3  for 0957 , 11 for pg1115 , and 017 for b0218 ) .",
    "fortunately there is hope because _ all three _ systems now show ring - like images of the quasar host system : 0957 and pg1115 from nicmos images ( impey _ et al . _",
    "1998 ; kochanek _ et al . _",
    "1998 ) and b0218 in radio images ( patnaik _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ) . in theory ,",
    "a high - s / n image of a well - resolved ring with extended structure can offer very strong constraints on the mass model ( see method of wallington _",
    "1996 ) . at present , however , such information has not yet been used in detailed modelling of any of these systems ( indeed the s / n of present ring images may be insufficient ) .",
    "so we reiterate our caution : the 0957 system currently has _ many _ more quantitative constraints on lensing geometry than either pg1115 or b0218 , and yet a realistic examination of possible mass distributions leaves h@xmath0  uncertain by @xmath323 , even ignoring the uncertainties in @xmath11 .",
    "half of our h@xmath0  error budget arises from uncertainties in @xmath11 , which is a substantial correction for 0957 because the lens is in a modest cluster .",
    "will other lenses be free of errors arising from the mass - sheet degeneracy ? in the case of pg1115 ,",
    "it is clear that the lens galaxy is in a group , and the influence of the group potential is important for the lens model ( impey _ et al . _  1998 ) , so the mass - sheet term ( and higher - order `` cluster '' potential terms ) must be considered in a thorough examination of the lens model .",
    "we note that the precision of weak lensing and losvd measurements in determining @xmath167 are _ independent of the value of @xmath167 _ , so the mass sheet problem may be no more accurately resolved in pg1115 than in 0957 , despite the fact that the mass sheet is weaker . for b0218 , which appears to be an isolated spiral , there may be _ a priori _ reasons why @xmath167 can be assumed to be close to zero , and it need not be measured accurately by weak lensing or losvd .",
    "we have introduced unpleasant but realistic complexity and uncertainty into the determination of h@xmath0  via gravitational time delays .",
    "we consider this a sign of the maturity of the field rather than a discouragement of further investigation , though , since we believe that each lens will be left with @xmath380 uncertainty in h@xmath0  once detailed lens models incorporating a variety of lensed features are produced for each lens .",
    "since the errors in each case are independent , the increasing numbers of systems with known time delays will continue to yield a more accurate average h@xmath0  value .",
    "we reiterate the virtues of the lensing h@xmath0 : it is a global measurement of geometry , not affected by local anomalies of flow or expansion ; it is physically based , so that it is difficult to imagine any undetected systematic effects that might affect its results , aside from a failure of general relativity . finally , it is completely independent of other methods , and the continued agreement with these other methods increases confidence in the entire distance ladder .",

    "the positions of components a5 and b5 are determined to high precision , with formal uncertainties of only @xmath37  mas , or 0.2% of their displacements from the quasar cores .",
    "use of these tiny uncertainties in our fitting procedure would effectively constrain the local magnification matrices ( second derivatives of the lens potential @xmath6 ) to 0.2% . we choose to relax this constraint by increasing the sizes of the error",
    "ellipses for the jet image positions to circles with radii equal to 1% of their displacements from the quasar cores .",
    "there are several justifications for this :    * the 0.1  mas formal uncertainties given by the vlbi analyses may be underestimated .",
    "the a5/b5 positions change by @xmath381  mas for blfgks s various modelling procedures , which we take as more indicative of the uncertainty .",
    "the complex structures of the jets are being fit by a simplified model of a chain of gaussians .",
    "the fitted locations of these idealized jet components probably is somewhat dependent upon the @xmath382-plane coverage ( _ e.g. _ the effective resolution ) of the observations , and perhaps the s / n level . since the b jet is a demagnified version of the a jet , it is effectively being viewed with different @xmath382-plane coverage ( relative to its angular size ) than the a jet .",
    "it might therefore be imprudent to trust the relative positions of the a and b gaussian components to the formal 0.1  mas error . *",
    "the quantity of interest to us is the gravitational potential difference between quasars a and b , which is a large - scale property of the lens .",
    "requiring jets a5 and b5 to have a common source is in essence a constraint upon the magnification near the a and b quasars , which depends primarily on the lens mass density at a and b image locations .",
    "specifying such a local property as tightly as 0.1% could misleadingly constrain the global solution for the g1 mass parameters , if the parameterized form of the mass distribution does not exactly match the true distribution .",
    "it is unlikely that any simple parametric model of the g1 mass would describe the true mass distribution to better than 1% accuracy on 50  mas scales .",
    "we consider it prudent , therefore , to increase the uncertainties in jet positions , thereby allowing the models some freedom in local magnification , which allows for the possibility that the true surface density has small - scale deviations from our model . * increasing the error ellipse on the jet components can only increase the range of h@xmath0  values from models with acceptable @xmath38 values .",
