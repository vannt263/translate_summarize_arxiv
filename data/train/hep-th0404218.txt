    "an important point in discussion is if the extreme black holes behave as thermal objects .",
    "more than a decade ago , preskill _ et al _ @xcite pointed out that the thermal description of a black hole becomes ill - defined as the black hole approaches the extreme limit . in its treatment",
    "the use the criterion that the standard semiclassical description , which neglects the back reaction , is not self - consistent if the emission of a typical quantum radiation changes the temperature by an amount comparable to the value of the temperature . for a schwarzschild black hole , the thermal description breaks down simultaneously as the classical description of spacetime does @xcite . at the final stages of the evaporation",
    ", the black hole field has a high curvature and the radius of the horizon is of the order of the planck length , besides , as the temperature rises as the mass diminishes , the problem of the back reaction becomes unavoidable .",
    "thus , the planck mass is the only relevant scale of mass that it is needed to take account in a full theory of quantum gravity .",
    "nevertheless , for a kerr - newman black hole the breaks down occurs near the extreme case when the mass is much greater than the planck mass and the corrections due to quantum gravity are expected to be negligible .    in @xmath0 dimensional gravity",
    "the btz black hole solution is a spacetime of constant negative curvature , but it differs from anti - de sitter ( ads ) space in its global properties @xcite .",
    "the related investigations of the thermodynamics properties of this solution have not included considerations about the nature of a possible break down of its thermal description .",
    "a obvious question is if this type of black hole experiment , as its four dimensional counterpart , a break down of the its thermal description and what is the relevant mass scale involved .",
    "it was found by reznik @xcite that the planck mass in @xmath0 dimensions has a physical significance related to the description of the thermodynamics of the hawking emission process , for static btz black holes .",
    "this is a key point when we try to shed some light in the behavior of btz black holes in relation to limits to its description as a thermal objects .",
    "the purpose of this article is to investigate the limits in the thermal description , using the approach describe in @xcite , for static and rotating btz black holes .    in section",
    "ii we expose briefly the principal parameters related with the thermodynamics of the btz black hole . in section iii we show the existence of three mass scales : @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 and discuss its physical meaning .",
    "the mass scale @xmath3 has not been previously discussed in the literature ; it appears when the approach describe in @xcite is applied to the thermodynamics of btz black holes .",
    "we have restricted our discussion to the case when the semiclassical description of the btz spacetime is valid .",
    "in section iv we discuss the particular limitations that experiment the thermodynamical description of btz black holes .",
    "we show the roll played by the above three masses in these limitations .",
    "in particular , we explicit calculate the conditions imposed on the black hole parameters in order to have a well description of the thermodynamics of the hawking emission process .",
    "the problem of the back reaction is considered for spinless btz black holes .",
    "the near extreme black hole is discussed and the breakdown of its thermal description , in the sense discussed in @xcite , is analyzed .",
    "finally , in section v some concluding remarks are presented .",

    "the action considered in @xcite is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a surface term , and the radius of curvature @xmath11 provides the length scale necessary to have a horizon ( @xmath12 is the cosmological constant ) .    the axially symmetric btz black hole written in stationary coordinates is @xmath13 where the lapse @xmath14 and the angular shift @xmath15 are given by @xmath16 with @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "the constant of integration @xmath20 is the conserved charge associated with asymptotic invariance under time displacements and @xmath21 ( angular momentum ) is that associated with rotational invariance .",

    "we will show in this section that the thermal description of a spinless btz black hole is ill defined when the black hole mass approaches to a new mass scale , not discussed previously in the literature .",
    "for this reason we first discuss the relevant mass scales in the theory of black hole in @xmath0 dimensions .    for a schwarszchild black hole , at the planck scale , the fluctuations of the geometry become important and this occurs when its radius becomes comparable to the compton wavelength , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath54 . from this relationship",

    "since the planck mass in @xmath0 dimensions is a classical mass unit ( contains only the gravitational constant ) , it is not surprising that appears in classical phenomena associated with @xmath0 dimensional fluids in hydrostatic equilibrium . if the cosmological constant is not included , classical results show that there exist a universal mass , in the sense that all rotationally invariant structures in hydrostatic equilibrium have a mass that is proportional to @xmath1 @xcite . in this case",
    "there are no black hole solution and the possibility of collapse is clearly forbidden .",
    "nevertheless , the study of the structures , with a mass @xmath20 and a radius @xmath67 in hydrostatic equilibrium in ads gravity leads to an upper bound on the ratio @xmath68 similar to the four dimensional case .",
    "this result shows that exist the possibility of collapse for matter distributions that have the ratio @xmath68 over the above upper bound .",
    "black holes with large masses are possible to exist ( large with respect to @xmath1 ) , even more , any fluid distribution in hydrostatic equilibrium has necessarily a mass greater than @xmath1 . with the assumption that the btz black hole is the end of a collapse",

    "a remarkable result , as we shall see below , is that without the length scale provides by the cosmological constant is not possible to build a unit mass containing @xmath8 .",

    "this yield the mass scale , @xmath2 , given by @xmath73 for this reason reznik @xcite identify the planck mass in @xmath0 dimensions with @xmath74 .",
    "we can obtain another mass scale when the limitations of the thermal description of a black hole are studied . in the following analysis",
    "we will consider a classical background geometry , ignoring the back reaction . as it was pointed out in @xcite",
    "the semiclassical description of the black hole evaporation is not self consistent if the emission of a typical quantum radiation changes the temperature by an amount comparable to the value of the temperature .",
    "if @xmath33 is the energy of the quantum and if @xmath75 is the change of temperature that experiment the black hole after the emission , then from the relation @xmath76 , where @xmath46 is specific heat at @xmath77 , the condition for the thermal description to be self - consistent is @xmath78 which is equivalent to impose @xmath79^{1/2 } <",

    "a crucial point of the characteristic behavior of thermodynamics of the spinless btz black hole was pointed out by reznik @xcite .",

    "contrary to the schwarzschild black hole , at the scale of @xmath1 the temperature obey the relation @xmath106 . at this scale",
    "the energy emitted by the black hole is no important with respect to the energy of the black hole itself .",
