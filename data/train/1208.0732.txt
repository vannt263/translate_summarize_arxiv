    "r coronae borealis stars ( rcbs ) are hydrogen deficient stars , with a carbon rich atmosphere @xcite .",
    "these very unusual stars are observed to be approximately @xmath9 he and @xmath10 c by mass .",
    "the masses of rcb stars are difficult to measure since they have never been observed in a binary system , but stellar pulsation models have shown masses to be on the order of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the luminosity is characterized by a peculiar behavior : they fade at irregular intervals by up to 8 magnitudes , and gradually recover back to maximum luminosity over a period of a few months to a year .",
    "such an observational feature is thought to be caused by clouds of carbon dust formed by the star itself @xcite .",
    "rcb stars show many anomalous elemental abundances compared to solar .",
    "typically they are extremely deficient in hydrogen and are enriched relative to fe , in n , al , na , si , s , ni , the s - process elements , and sometimes o @xcite .",
    "the lower bound on the @xmath12c/@xmath13c ratio is between 14 - 100 for the majority of rcb stars , much larger than the equilibrium value in stars of solar metallicity which is 3.4 @xcite , although at least one star , v cra , shows a significant abundance of @xmath13c @xcite .",
    "also , lithium has been detected in 5 rcb stars @xcite .",
    "in other rcbs there is no lithium observed .",
    "the atmospheres of these stars show material processed during h burning via the cno cycle and he burning via the 3-@xmath14 process . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the more recent discovery of the oxygen isotopic ratio , @xmath0 to @xmath1 @xcite , found to be of order unity in rcb stars ( the stars measured had ratios between 0.3 and 20 ) .",
    "this ratio is found to be @xmath15 500 in the solar neighborhood @xcite , and varies from 200 to 600 in the galactic interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "no other known class of stars displays @xmath161 @xcite .    in a single star ,",
    "partial he burning on the cool edge of the he burning shell produces a significant amount of @xmath17o but normally it would not be mixed to the surface .",
    "if he burning continues to its conclusion the @xmath17o will be turned into @xmath18ne @xcite .",
    "two scenarios have been put forth to explain the progenitor evolution for rcb stars ; one is a final helium shell flash and the other a double degenerate white dwarf ( wd ) merger @xcite . according to @xcite",
    ", rcb stars could be the result of a final flash , when a single star late in its evolution has left the asymptotic giant branch and is cooling to form a wd and a shell of helium surrounding the core ignites .",
    "however , the temperatures that result from he burning in a final flash will result in @xmath19n being completely burned into @xmath18ne leaving little @xmath1 @xcite .    in the second scenario , a close binary system consisting of a he and a co wd merges , leading to an rcb star @xcite .",
    "@xcite explain that theoretically the accretion of a he wd @xmath20 onto a co wd @xmath21 can produce a carbon - rich supergiant star ( m@xmath150.9 m@xmath22 ) that is hydrogen - deficient at the surface after two common envelope ( ce ) phases . in this scenario , the he wd is disrupted and forms the envelope of the newly merged star while the co wd forms the core . in he burning conditions the partial completion of the reaction chain ( @xmath23 ) will take place during the merger when accretion results in high temperatures , and c and o may be dredged up from the core .",
    "a large amount of @xmath1 will be created only if this process is transient and is not allowed to proceed to completion .",
    "the available @xmath24 is a result of cno cycling in the progenitor star , and the amount depends on the initial metallicity of that star .",
    "hence the maximum amount of @xmath1 formed can not exceed the initial abundance of @xmath24 , unless additional @xmath24 can be produced .",
    "our objective is to investigate whether the merger of a he wd and a co wd with a combined mass of @xmath25 ( similar to rcb star masses ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can lead to conditions suitable for producing oxygen isotopic ratios observed in rcb stars .",
    "close wd binary systems may be the progenitors for type ia supernovae @xcite , and such systems have therefore attracted much interest both from theoretical and observational points of view .",
    "using an earlier version of the hydrodynamics code used in this work , @xcite and @xcite studied the stability of the mass transfer in close wd binary systems .",
    "the fate of a close wd binary system depends on the mass ratio of the two wds . neglecting the angular momentum in the spin of the binary components and allowing the angular momentum contained in the mass transfer stream to be returned to the orbit",
    ", @xcite found that mass ratios below @xmath26 are stable .",
    "however , if the mass transfer stream directly strikes the accretor instead of orbiting around it to form an accretion disk , this stability limit may be reduced significantly .",
    "recent simulations by marcello et al .",
    "( private comm . )",
    "indicate that even a mass ratio of 0.4 may be unstable and lead to a merger . @xcite",
    "have recently reported observations of the close wd binary system , sdss j065133.33 + 284423.3 , which consists of a @xmath27 he wd and a @xmath28 co wd , and is predicted to start mass transfer in about 900,000 years .",
    "if these two wds merge , what will the resulting object look like ?",
    "other groups have employed smooth particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations to study wd mergers , for instance @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the results from grid based hydrodynamics simulations are compared to sph simulations of wd mergers , and it is found that the two methods produce results in excellent agreement .",
    "very recently , @xcite studied the nucleosynthesis as the result of the merger of a @xmath29 co wd and a @xmath30 he wd . the merger simulation was performed with an sph simulation code @xcite .",
    "they find that if only the outer part of the envelope ( @xmath31 ) is convective , the @xmath0 to @xmath1 ratio is 19 , which is in the range measured for rcb stars @xcite . on the contrary , if the entire envelope is convective , the ratio is 370 .",
    "@xcite investigated the surface elements resulting from a merger of a co with a he wd , based on 1-d stellar evolution models and parametric nucleosynthesis analysis .",
    "they considered two situations , a cold ( no nucleosynthesis ) merger , and a hot merger ( with nucleosynthesis ) . in both cases ,",
    "they find surface abundances of c , n , and o that can be made to match the observed rcb star surface abundances . s and si",
    "however , do not match .",
    "in the hot merger scenario , the most promising location for nucleosynthesis to take place is in a hot and dense region just on the outside of the original accretor , as for instance seen in the simulations by @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite .",
    "this region forms as accreting matter from the donor impacts the accretor .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate whether the unusual abundances measured in rcb stars can be produced in a wd merger , by first performing hydrodynamic simulations of the merger of two wds ( using a a modified version of the 3-dimensional hydrodynamic code called flower , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in section 2 of this paper",
    ", we present the methodology of our work . here",
    "the details of the hydrodynamic code and the nucleosynthesis code along with their initial conditions are given . in section 3 ,",
    "the results of the hydrodynamic simulations and their corresponding nucleosynthesis calculations are presented .",
    "finally , in section 4 we compare our results with the results of other authors , and in section 5 we discuss our results along with future directions for the work in this paper .",
    "in the hydrodynamic simulations , the fluid is modeled as a zero - temperature fermi gas plus an ideal gas .",
    "the total pressure , @xmath32 , is given by the sum of the ideal gas pressure , @xmath33 , and the degeneracy pressure @xcite : @xmath34,\\ ] ] where @xmath35 , and the constants a and b are given as : @xmath36 @xmath37 is the electron mass , @xmath38 is the proton mass , @xmath39 is planck s constant , and @xmath40 is the speed of light .",
    "similarly , the internal energy density of the gas is the sum of the ideal gas internal energy density , @xmath41 , and the internal energy density of the degenerate electron gas , @xmath42 , @xcite : @xmath43.\\ ] ] the kinetic energy density of the gas is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the velocity of the fluid and @xmath46 is the density . the total energy density , @xmath47 , is the sum of these terms : @xmath48    the hydrodynamics code uses a cylindrical grid , with equal spacing between the grid cells in the radial and the vertical directions .",
    "we have run 5 simulations with the same total mass and different values of the mass ratio ( q ) of donor to accretor mass of the two wds .",
    "the simulations with @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 had 226 radial zones , 146 vertical zones and 256 azimuthal zones , while the @xmath52 and @xmath53 simulations had 194 radial zones , 130 vertical zones , and 256 azimuthal zones .",
    "the outer boundaries are configured such that mass that reaches this boundary can not flow back onto the grid .",
    "the outer radial boundary is about 1.5 times the size of the outer edge of the donor wd ( the larger star ) .",
    "likewise , the vertical boundaries are about 2 times the size of the donor wd .",
    "we allow the hydrodynamics simulation to run sufficiently long after the two wds have merged that a steady - state - like configuration is reached .",
    "the time to reach this configuration depends , in part , on how much angular momentum is artificially removed from the system .",
    "initially , the temperature is zero everywhere , meaning that @xmath33 and @xmath41 are zero .",
    "the initial @xmath47 can therefore be calculated from @xmath54 and @xmath46 directly .",
    "the total energy density is evolved using the hydrodynamics equations , from which @xmath41 at a subsequent time step can be found : @xmath55 since both @xmath46 and @xmath54 ( needed to calculate @xmath42 and @xmath56 ) are also advanced using the hydrodynamics equations .",
    "knowing @xmath41 we can extract the temperature : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the specific heat capacity at constant volume @xcite given by : @xmath59 where we have assumed that @xmath60 , with @xmath61 and @xmath62 being the average charge and mass for a fully ionized gas .",
    "due to limitations in our numerical approach , we will assume an equal mix of c and o when calculating the temperatures .",
    "this is approximately correct for a co mixture , and is a bit overestimated when he is present .",
    "however , when using the temperature for nucleosynthesis calculations , we will use a corrected temperature taking helium and other elements into account .    using a self consistent field code developed by @xcite , similar to that developed by @xcite , a configuration of two synchronously rotating wds is constructed .",
    "these data are used to initialize the hydrodynamics simulations . to speed up the merger process ( and in order to save cpu hours ) , angular momentum is artificially removed from the system at a rate of @xmath10 per orbit for several orbits ( the exact number of orbits depends on the simulation and does not seem to change the outcome of the merger , see * ? ? ?",
    "this leads to mass transfer from the donor star to the accretor , and , for the mass ratios that we investigate , the stars end up dynamically merging .",
    "the results of the hydrodynamics simulations are inspected for locations suitable for forming @xmath1 . using those conditions ,",
    "nucleosynthesis simulations are run using the post - processing network code ( ppn ) from the nugrid project @xcite .",
    "we use the single - zone frame ( sppn ) of the nugrid project @xcite to estimate the nucleosynthesis conditions in the merger simulations as post - processing .",
    "a nuclear network kernel , containing all the nuclear reactions , reaction rates and a solver package , evolves the nuclear network over each time step .",
    "the input parameters required for the ppn code are @xmath63 , @xmath46 , the initial abundances of nuclei , the time period over which the network has to be calculated , and the time step for each calculation .",
    "we use the solar metallicity nugrid rgb and agb models ( set 1.2 , pignatari et al . in prep ) that were calculated with the mesa stellar evolution code @xcite to derive the initial abundances of the shell of fire ( sof ; see section  [ resultsection ] ) , where most of the nucleosynthesis takes place , from the he - wd and co - wd components .",
    "we first look for the locations in the simulations that are conducive to producing a high amount of @xmath1 , in order to obtain the extremely low value of @xmath0/ @xmath1 observed in rcbs .",
    "the t , @xmath46 , and the nuclear abundances of those locations are fed as inputs to the nucleosynthesis code , which is then run over a suitable period of time .",
    "the evolution of various nuclear species relevant to this ratio at the constant t , @xmath46 conditions chosen is studied .",
    "the value of the @xmath0/ @xmath1 ratio at each time step is then compared to the observed value .",
    "when the initially cold donor material falls onto the cold accretor it is heated through shocks or adiabatic compression .",
    "this leads to a very hot and dense region surrounding the accretor , the sof ( hence we labeled it the `` shell of fire '' ) .",
    "such a sof is a common feature in simulations of this kind ( see for instance * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , only simulations with @xmath4 show a sof around the merged core . during the simulations , the peak temperature found in regions with high density ( @xmath64 being the nuclear cross section ) these hot",
    ", low density regions will not have significant nuclear production . ]",
    "strongly depends on the initial mass ratio ( see fig .  [ tvsq ] ) , with higher values of @xmath65 leading to lower temperatures ( in disagreement with results in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in simulations with higher @xmath65 ( and the same total mass",
    ") , the material falling onto the accretor descends into a shallower potential well .",
    "therefore , its kinetic energy is lower when it impacts the accretor , leading to lower temperatures .",
    "typical maximum temperatures in high density regions ( @xmath66 ) in the high @xmath65 simulations are less than @xmath67 k ( assuming c and o only ) and last only for a short period of time comparable to an initial orbital period of the system ( @xmath68 s ) .",
    "the difference to @xcite might be related to the fact that we do not take the nuclear energy output into account .",
    "however , we note that our result is in agreement with @xcite who found that @xmath69 k for @xmath52 and @xmath70 , while @xmath71 k for @xmath72 and @xmath70 and they too have nucleosynthesis in their simulations .",
    "another possible explanation for the difference with the @xcite result is that they report the maximum temperature for minimum @xmath73 ( @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the thermonuclear and dynamic time scales respectively ) , instead of the peak temperature .    .",

    "thus , it is possible to reproduce in the sof the @xmath5 ratio found in rcb stars for a significantly large period of time .",
    "however , it requires the initial abundances of the sof of the 0.7 case and the sustenance of constant temperature and density conditions of this case .",
    "we recall that the maximum amount of @xmath1 that can be produced is also limited by the amount of @xmath24 present .",
    "the metallicity of the he wd progenitor determines the initial abundance of @xmath24 but as can be seen in the nucleosynthesis calculations , new @xmath24 is formed by h - burning via the partial cno cycle .",

    "the surface is defined as the sof plus the layer on top of it . for the purpose of a rough estimate",

    "the above results are from single zone nucleosynthesis calculations",
    ". it would be important to perform multi - zone calculations as well in order to consider the role of mixing between different layers of the star and its consequences for the abundances .    from the nucleosynthesis calculations for each @xmath65",
    ", we also compute the total energy released by nuclear processes per unit time in the sof ( fig .  [ energy ] ) .",
    "note that the energy calculated here does not account for the loss of energy by neutrinos from weak interactions and therefore the energy added to the sof will be lower by a factor of 1.5 - 2 . taking this into account , we see from ( fig .  [ energy ] ) that within the timescale of the simulation ( @xmath128 in table  [ lowqdetailstable ] ) the nuclear energy released is comparable to the internal energy of the sof ( depending on the initial @xmath65 ) .",
    "the energy released in the first few hundred seconds is mainly from proton captures .",
    "helium ( for instance , triple @xmath14 or @xmath145 ) interacts on a much longer timescale resulting in a plateau for @xmath52 and @xmath80 in fig .  [ energy ] between 10 and 100 seconds .",
    "the extra energy released from nuclear processes may lead to higher temperatures , and these processes could play an important role in determining the temperature of the sof .",
    "cooling processes and dynamical effects may also be important but these can not be estimated with our current tools .",
    "our nucleosynthesis calculations were made assuming constant temperature and density . in the sof ,",
    "the temperature in the hydrodynamics simulations are found to fluctuate significantly , especially during the actual merger where the temperature may briefly reach up towards @xmath146 k ( assuming c and o only ) . also , the sof spans a range of densities , something that our nucleosynthesis calculations can not capture .",
    "more elaborate nucleosynthesis calculations ( preferably included in the hydrodynamics simulations ) should be performed in order to find accurate abundance ratios .",
    "the simulation discussed in @xcite does include a ( simple ) nucleosynthesis network in the dynamics calculations followed by a more elaborate nucleosynthesis calculation in the post processing , and they find @xmath0 to @xmath1 ratios similar to this study .",
    "the oxygen isotopic ratio is @xmath147 in the @xmath52 simulation reported here after 1000 seconds ( the dynamical time scale ) , and is much higher than the lowest value of 19 reported for @xmath52 in @xcite , and about the same as their ratio of 370 for a fully convective envelope .",
    "the total mass in that simulation is higher than the total mass used in our simulations which will affect the temperatures and maybe also the dredge - up , possibly explaining the differences between their results and ours .",
    "@xcite also presented simulations of wd mergers with higher total masses ( their focus was on type ia supernovae ) .",
    "a noticeable difference between their findings and ours is that they have an `` sof '' ( or at least a hot ring surrounding their merged core ; the 3d temperature structure is not shown in the paper ) even in the equal mass simulations .",
    "we only find a post merger sof for @xmath4 .",
    "the merged core in the equal mass ( @xmath72 ) simulations in @xcite appears to be cold , indicating that there has not been much mixing occurring in the core ( however in their @xmath148 simulation the cores appear to mix similarly to our findings ; this is also their simulation that is closest to ours in mass ) .",
    "the sph simulations of @xcite and @xcite are not only for a different total mass , but also include nucleosynthesis , and it is plausible that it can cause the differences between their results and ours , especially the fairly rapid burning of the helium atmosphere of their wds .",
    "our hydrodynamics simulations did not include the energy released from nuclear processes .",
    "we showed that this energy is comparable to the thermal energy in the sof . in the short period of time",
    "that the hydrodynamics simulations ran , this extra energy input will probably not make much of a difference .",
    "however , on a longer time scale , with even more energy input from nuclear reactions , it is possible that the conditions in the sof will not remain constant as we assumed in fig .",
    "[ img_o16_o18 ] .",
    "however , a higher thermal energy can also make the sof expand .",
    "following the dynamics for a much longer time , including the energy produced in nuclear processes , is needed in order to fully understand the evolution of the sof .",
    "the ratio of @xmath149 to @xmath150 is observed to be very low ( of the order unity ) in rcb stars . from hydrodynamic simulations of double degenerate mergers for various mass ratios ,",
    "we have therefore looked for conditions that would allow for production of @xmath150 in order to explain this ratio .",
    "this requires temperatures of the order @xmath151 - @xmath87 k. at lower temperatures , @xmath150 will not form on the available dynamic time scale , and at higher temperatures it will be destroyed ( converted to @xmath119 ) as soon as it forms .",
    "our results show that the maximum temperature that can be found in the sof depends strongly on the mass ratio , @xmath65 .",
    "low values of @xmath65 give temperatures in the sof of @xmath152 k ( assuming realistic abundances ) , while mass ratios above @xmath49 gives temperatures much lower than that . hence the lower @xmath65 values that we have investigated will give temperatures in the sof suitable for @xmath150 production on a dynamical timescale .    on a dynamical time scale , we do not find very low oxygen ratios in the sof in any of our simulations .",
    "after a thousand seconds , the @xmath52 simulation reaches a @xmath0 to @xmath1 ratio of about 2000 , since not much @xmath1 is produced on such a short time scale and because of the large amount of @xmath0 present from the dredge up . within a day , the oxygen ratio in the @xmath52 simulation reaches its lowest value of @xmath153 ( fig .",
    "[ img_o16_o18 ] ) .",
    "after that , @xmath1 is being destroyed and the ratio increases .",
    "the @xmath53 simulation reaches its lowest value of 16 after @xmath154 seconds , after which the ratio increases again as @xmath1 is being destroyed .",
    "the best case for obtaining low oxygen ratios is the @xmath49 simulation , which reaches the lowest @xmath0 to @xmath1 of @xmath155 after @xmath156 years , assuming the conditions remain constant for that long .",
    "this is comparable to the observed oxygen ratios in rcb stars .",
    "as we have shown , the nuclear reactions begin very fast , and the extra energy released is likely to affect the conditions in the sof .",
    "unfortunately we can not model this at present , and here we simply state that if the very low oxygen ratios of order unity shall be achieved in the @xmath49 simulations , the conditions in the sof must remain relatively unchanged for a period of about a hundred years . in the high-@xmath65 simulations the temperature was not sufficiently high to produce @xmath1 .",
    "however , as we have shown the protons react very quickly , releasing an amount of energy comparable to the thermal energy in the sof .",
    "hence , it is possible that even in the high @xmath65 simulations , the sof prior to the merger can become sufficiently hot for the nucleosynthesis involving helium to start .",
    "this extra energy from nuclear processes leads to an extra pressure term , that could potentially help preserve the sof also in the high-@xmath65 simulations so that the @xmath1 production can continue . furthermore , even though the amount of @xmath1 in rcbs is strongly enhanced compared to all other known objects , it is important to keep in mind that among rcb stars the observed oxygen ratio varies by 2 orders of magnitude from star to star .",
    "the @xmath149 to @xmath150 ratio depends both on the formation of @xmath150 , and also on the amount of @xmath157 present . in all of our simulations",
    ", we have found significant dredge up of accretor material which consists primarily of @xmath149 and @xmath158 .",
    "@xmath150 is formed from @xmath159 , which in part depends on the initial metallicity of the progenitor stars , assumed to be solar giving about @xmath10 of @xmath159 .",
    "but @xmath24 is also being produced ( figs .",
    "[ img_0.5 ] , [ img_0.6 ] , and [ img_0.7 ] ) in the nuclear processes occurring in the sof .",
    "the @xmath0 to @xmath1 ratios , that we find in the sof ( shown in figs .",
    "[ img_o16_o18 ] ) , are the lowest values possible from our simulations .",
    "if less @xmath0 were dredged up from the accretor , then less @xmath1 would need to be produced in order to obtain low oxygen ratios .",
    "one way to avoid contaminating the sof with @xmath0 from dredge - up , would be if the accretor is a hybrid he / co wd .",
    "@xcite modeled a @xmath160 hybrid",
    "he / co wd with a he envelope of more than @xmath161 . in our simulations , we found that about @xmath162 of accretor material was dredged - up , most of it ending up in the sof . if the accretor is a hybrid",
    "he / co wd , most of this dredged - up material might turn out to be @xmath163 , and the @xmath0 contamination of the sof would be much less . in this case , the lower mass of the accretor means the donor must also have a lower mass in order to get a tidal disruption of the donor rather than a core merging .",
    "this lower total mass could result in lower temperatures .",
    "furthermore , a mixture with mostly he could also lead to lower temperatures ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : t ] and [ eq : cv ] ) .",
    "however , as we discussed above , the reacting protons might heat the gas to a sufficiently high temperature to start the helium burning no matter what the total mass .",
    "hence , it remains to be seen if the oxygen isotope ratio will be of the correct order if this is the situation .",
    "@xcite showed that a significant fraction of sdb stars are expected to be in close - period binaries with he wds .",
    "after completion of helium burning , sdb stars may evolve into hybrid co / he wds @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", a population synthesis study found that there should be almost 200,000 sdb stars in binaries in the galaxy .",
    "hence it may not be unreasonable that a small fraction of these are in a close binary with a he wd , and that after the sdb star has evolved into a hybrid wd they can merge .    when the merged object begins to expand ,",
    "the temperature and density of the sof are likely to drop which may bring the nuclear processes there to a halt .",
    "hence the oxygen ratio in the sof at that time may be representative of what will be observed at the surface of this object . with our numerical approach",
    ", we can not determine when the merged object will begin to expand .",
    "convection may be triggered quickly in the sof , as the thermal diffusion time ( @xmath164 seconds using @xmath165 from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is much larger than the 100 seconds thermonuclear time scale ( @xmath166 , where @xmath167 is the specific heat at constant pressure that we estimate to be of order @xmath81 erg / g k , @xmath63 is the temperature of order @xmath81 k , and @xmath168 is the nuclear energy production rate of order @xmath169 after 1000 seconds ; fig.[energy ] ) .",
    "if the material outside the merged core and the sof accretes quickly , it could affect the sof .",
    "@xcite argued that the viscous time scale for material in a disk surrounding such a core is an hour to a year , indicating that it could accrete relatively fast .",
    "alternatively , the merged object can expand before this material has accreted . in that case",
    ", the sof is unlikely to be affected much by this material .",
    "however , the @xcite result would indicate that the expansion would have to begin quickly ( less than a year ) since the accretion may occur on this time scale .",
    "we found in the @xmath53 simulation that the oxygen ratio is 16 after only @xmath7 seconds , a significant enhancement from the solar value and comparable to what is seen in some rcbs .",
    "we note that most of the accretor material , that is being dredged up , ends up in the sof .",
    "the material outside the sof is mostly from the he wd ( table  [ dredgeuptable ] ) .",
    "the conditions outside the sof are not favorable for nuclear processes to occur , and so if only the matter outside the sof swells up to supergiant size ( without mixing in newly produced elements in the sof ) , the resulting object could look like a helium star with some carbon , ie .",
    "an rcb star .",
    "we have found that the best conditions for reaching the low oxygen ratios occur if the temperature remains @xmath170 k. then @xmath1 forms slowly , and is destroyed even more slowly .",
    "hence it is plausible that the merger of a co wd and a he wd can lead to the formation of an rcb star , although a more elaborate investigation must be performed in order to conclusively answer this question .",
