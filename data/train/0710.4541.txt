    "it has been suggested by blasone and vitiello and collaborators  @xcite that in quantum field theoretic systems with _ mixing _ , such as neutrinos with flavour mixing , for instance , the flavour  eigenstates can be expressed as a condensate in the fock space of the mass quanta .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown recently that there is a `` vacuum energy '' associated with this condensate which would be a contribution to the dark energy .",
    "in contrast to the standard mass - eigenstate formalism , where the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the stress tensor vanishes , when one calculates the vev of the stress tensor with respect the flavour vacuum , the result is non - trivial , indicating spontaneous breaking of lorentz - symmetry .",
    "in fact , computing such vevs for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 components of the stress tensor in robertson - walker space times , the authors of @xcite have conjectured that there is a non - trivial , and non - perturbative , dark energy contribution to the vacuum , and an equation of state @xmath2 with @xmath3 close to @xmath4 .",
    "these are features that are compatible with recent observations .    in view of the breaking of lorentz - symmetry by the flavour vacuum , characterized by a non - zero vev of the stress tensor",
    ", we will examine in this context a microscopic model discussed by mavromatos and sarkar  @xcite where such a feature is accommodated within a specific space - time foam model in the framework of modern brane / string theory .",
    "the foam model involves brane worlds which are embedded in higher - dimensional bulk space - times , and are punctured by d0-brane ( point - like defects )  @xcite .",
    "the interaction of generic stringy matter with such defects involves the discontinuous process of splitting of the matter string by the defect , and subsequent joining , ignoring for the moment constraints from conservation of specific quantum numbers .",
    "this yields lorentz - violating metric distortions  @xcite , @xmath5 , with @xmath6 the recoil velocity of the localised d - particle ( d0 ) defect , due to the topologically - non - trivial  interaction with the stringy matter as well as an induced local expansion .",
    "in a situation where one encounters a statistical population of d0-defects , one may have an average @xmath7 ( i.e. isotropic models for d - particle foam ) .",
    "hence , since @xmath8 for a velocity four - vector , one has a preferred time - like direction in space time in this case , leading to induced lorentz - symmetry breaking from non - trivial higher order correlators of @xmath6 .",
    "such a mechanism for lorentz - symmetry violation is testable since it leads to a quite distinct signature for cpt violation  @xcite in meson factories  @xcite , associated with a modification of the einstein - podolsky - rosen(epr)-type particle correlations .",
    "electric charge conservation implies that charged states can not undergo such interactions .",
    "moreover `` flavour '' need not be conserved in the string splitting process .",
    "if d - particle foam contributes to the mixing of flavours then it only operates on the electrically - neutral neutrinos ( or mesons ) .",
    "the above - mentioned lorentz - violating flavour - vacua  appear to be the physically correct ones to characterize the interaction of electrically neutral flavour matter ( which for brevity we will refer to as neutrinos ) with d0 defects .",
    "it should be pointed out that in the work of @xcite the flavour vacuum formalism applies in general to _ all _ theories with mixing . in the above specific framework of stringy models of d - particle foam ,",
    "neutral _ flavour particles are subject to mixing and contribute to the dark energy .",
    "dark energy , when interpreted as a cosmological constant , gives a de sitter space - time with an associated horizon .",
    "hence , it is interesting for self - consistency to re - examine and reinterpret the vacuum oscillation phenomena in simple space - times with horizons . in our case",
    "the latter are interpreted as the metric distortions due to d - particle  recoil and will be shown to be most important for low energy neutrinos .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the approach of @xcite where an _ a priori _ flat space - time formalism was used to discuss the derivation of the dark energy contribution due to mixing . for simplicity",
    "we consider a two dimensional space - time metric as a physically - relevant toy model to illustrate the basic features of the approach .",
    "the restriction in space - time dimensionality is plausible if the interaction and recoil of neutrino matter with the d0 brane defects ( d - particles ) , is mainly along the ( spatial ) direction of the incident neutrino beam .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "we consider the recoil of d particles after the capture and subsequent emission of stringy matter in terms of suitable vertex operators  @xcite within a logarithmic field theory @xcite . by considering an ensemble of defects we model the metric induced by the recoil as a simple two - dimensional space - time with a horizon  @xcite .",
    "finite systems on a lattice with periodic boundary conditions will be considered and the thermodynamic limit will be taken subsequently . this allows a rigorous treatment of the orthogonality ( and also of unitary inequivalence  @xcite ) of the flavour and mass vacua .",
    "the effect of the space - time expansion on neutrino oscillations is evaluated . in order to check if a dark energy interpretation of the equation of state is allowed , the equation of state of the flavour vacuum ( after expansion ) is calculated .",
    "given the brane / string motivation for the model , a novel form of normal - ordering is introduced which demonstrates a contribution to dark energy .",
    "it is important to notice that the type of equation of state obtained by the above normal ordering procedure turns out to be formally independent of the initially assumed form of the scale factor of the robertson - walker background space time , thereby allowing for a self - consistent treatment of the back reaction _",
    "non - perturbative _ effects of the flavour vacuum onto the space time .",
    "some technical details of our approach are outlined in an appendix .",
    "the discovery of new solitonic structures in superstring theory has dramatically changed the understanding of target space structure .",
    "these new non - perturbative objects are known as d - branes and their inclusion leads to a scattering picture of space - time fluctuations .",
    "the study of d - brane dynamics has been made possible by polchinski s realisation that such solitonic string backgrounds can be described in a conformally invariant way in terms of world sheets with boundaries @xcite . on these boundaries",
    "dirichlet boundary conditions for the collective target - space coordinates of the soliton are imposed .",
    "the properties of d - branes in curved backgrounds is not fully developed and so it is necessary to be guided by approximate calculations . in the interaction of low energy matter",
    "( e.g. a closed string ) with a heavy d particle ( i.e. embedded in a @xmath9-dimensional space - time the d - particle recoils .",
    "such recoil fluctuations of d0 branes can be described by an effective stochastic space - time . from our point of view",
    "there are two parts to this interaction process : precursor and aftermath of the capture of a string by a d - particle .",
    "firstly the stringy matter has to approach the d - particle . in a superstring approach by considering the annulus amplitude for an open string fluctuation between a d@xmath10 and d@xmath11 brane which have a non - zero relative velocity it can be shown that there is an attractive potential between them @xcite . by specialising to @xmath12 and @xmath13",
    "we can give arguments as to why the low momenta strings are more likely to be captured by the d - particle .",
    "secondly we have the capture and the re - emission of a string by the d - particle .",
    "this involves a change in the background of the string and as such breaks conformal invariance .",
    "it is not known how to describe the process of capture for short times .",
    "it is the capture and re - emission process which can  be responsible  for a change in the flavour of the matter string . for long times after the capture and emission process a semi - classical approach",
    "is expected to be valid @xcite . in the wake of the capture process",
    "the vertex operator of the d - particle is described by an impulse approximation .",
    "the breaking of conformal invariance for large times can still be dealt with in terms of conformal data but with a set of recoil vertex operators which satisfy a logarithmic conformal algebra .",
    "such an impulse / recoil event results in general in a time - dependent induced metric distortion and vacuum energy .",
    "it is such a metric distortion that is the motivation for considering the simple model that we will consider .",
    "the time scale of the d - particle matter interaction can be estimated from perturbative string theory . in the adiabatic approximation for the relative speed @xmath14 between a p - brane and a d - particle separated by a distance @xmath15 , it is possible to estimate the potential energy @xmath16 using perturbative string theory @xcite .",
    "typically  the short range attractive part of the potential @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 with @xmath19 being the string scale and is the only relevant piece in a superstring theory . for the case of flavour oscillations with sharp momentum @xmath20 ( whose associated mass eigenstates have masses @xmath21 and @xmath22 with @xmath23 in our convention@xmath24 ) the time scale @xmath25 for the flavour changing capture and subsequent release of a matter particle by a heavy d - particle ( when @xmath26 ) can consequently be estimated by@xmath27 where @xmath28and @xmath29 . hence we deduce that qualitatively @xmath30 we shall then assume that the capture process is enhanced for low @xmath20 .",

    "these vertex operators have been calculated for non - relativistic branes where @xmath65 is small .",
    "consider now the operators @xmath66 , and @xmath67 . by calculating the correlators @xmath68 and @xmath69 with respect to the measure of the free bosonic string action we see that we have a logarithmic conformal field theory @xcite , _ provided _ that  @xcite @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the diameter of the world sheet disc and @xmath72 is an ultraviolet world - sheet cut - off .",

    "if we restrict the slow recoil to the @xmath75 direction ( on the brane ) we obtain the vertex operator @xmath76 @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the dilaton field . from considerations associated with conformal invariance of the bulk world sheet of the dressed theory @xcite @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the central charge deficit of the @xmath44-model describing the stringy excitations of the recoiling d - particle .",
    "we remind the reader that the restoration of the conformal invariance by the liouville @xmath78 system implies @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the central charge of the liouville part of the @xmath83-model .",
    "as discussed in detail in @xcite , one may argue that , in our case , @xmath84 is @xmath85 , assuming a critical bulk space - time dimension ( c.f .",
    "[ fig : recoil ] ) ; hence , to leading order in @xmath86 , its contributions can be ignored in comparison to the anomalous dimension term @xmath87 in ( [ conformaldim1 ] ) .",
    "thus , we have @xmath88 ( for @xmath89 ) and from ( [ dressed vertex ] ) we obtain : @xmath90 where the @xmath91 denote terms that do not contribute to physical correlators .",
    "such terms are proportional to either @xmath92 ( obtained by the action of @xmath93 on the heavyside operator @xmath94 ) , or @xmath95 ( which vanish in the conformal gauge on the world sheet ) .    in the recoil case",
    "the string is slightly _ supercritical _ , i.e. @xmath96 .",
    "in such a case , the zero mode @xmath97 of @xmath78 can be interpreted as a second time in addition to @xmath43 @xcite . from ( [ dressed vertex2 ] ) we then observe that the effect of @xmath76 in the action can be reinterpreted as an induced target space metric in the extended @xmath98-dimensional space - time @xmath99 @xmath100 where , following @xcite , we have assumed euclideanised @xmath43 , as required for convergence of the world - sheet path integral .    at first sight",
    ", it appears that this metric is characterised by two times , @xmath97 and @xmath43 .",
    "however , it has been argued  @xcite that the open string excitations on the brane world are such that they live on a @xmath101-dimensional hyper - surface of the extended @xmath98-dimensional two - time space - time ; the liouville mode is proportional to @xmath102,with @xmath6 the four - velocity on the d3 brane for the recoiling d - particle and @xmath6 can be written as @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the lorentz factor .",
    "we shall demonstrate this structure in an explicit example in which the three - brane world is obtained by compactification on magnetized tori , characterised by a magnetic field with intensity @xmath105 .",
    "this magnetic field is not a real one , but a statistical  field characterising the compactification .",
    "an open string excitation coupled to such a magnetic field , has its ends attached to the compactified three brane world .",
    "an encounter of the string with a d - particle is described by the addition of the following deformation to a free open - string @xmath44-model action : @xmath106 where @xmath107 denotes tangential derivative on the world - sheet boundary .",
    "this corresponds to the vertex operator for a gauge potential corresponding to a uniform magnetic field in the compactified toroidal dimensions @xmath108 , that appears suddenly at a time @xmath109 , in the co - moving frame of the recoiling d - particle , which has captured the open string excitation .",
    "the reader should notice that the specific calculation takes place in this co - moving frame ; the argument of the heavyside operator is the rest - frame time of the recoiling massive d - particle , which in terms of the original coordinates is expressed as @xmath110",
    ".    it can be easily seen  @xcite that the operator ( [ deformsudden ] ) has anomalous dimension @xmath111 , since the four velocity satisfies by definition @xmath8 , with respect to the background minkowski metric .",
    "this implies a liouville dressing similar to ( [ dressed vertex ] ) , with the corresponding liouville anomalous dimension @xmath112 , @xmath113    as shown in @xcite the open superstring excitations that couple to such a magnetic field will exhibit zeeman - like supersymmetric mass splittings between fermions and bosons   of the form : @xmath114 with @xmath115 the spin operator given by @xmath116   $ ] where @xmath117 are the dirac matrices relevant for @xmath118 dimensional space - time .",

    "since the above - mentioned mass splittings can be tuned by adjusting appropriately the intensity of the magnetic  field @xmath105 , in a way independent of the size of the four - dimensional vacuum energy contribution  @xcite , the above example is sufficiently generic and so of interest for phenomenological applications of superstring theories .",
    "the constraint ( [ liouvtime ] ) , which is consistent with general coordinate invariance on the brane world , implies that the dynamics of the open string excitations can effectively be considered on a @xmath101-dimensional space - time ( hypersurface ) , with a _ single _ time .",
    "although above we have argued in favour of ( [ liouvtime ] ) in the context of a specific superstring situation , nevertheless we may assume its validity in more general frameworks of supercritical strings  @xcite .    from ( [ liouvtime ] ) and ( [ metricrecoil ] )",
    "we then obtain for the induced @xmath101-dimensional target space - time metric ( with @xmath122 ) : @xmath123 we next consider the case of a statistically significant population of d - particles on the brane world ( c.f . fig .  [ fig : recoil ] ) ( d - particle foam ) .",
    "we may assume a random ( gaussian ) d - particle foam , such that  @xcite : @xmath124 and we assume slowly moving d - particles , so that cubic or higher powers of the recoil velocities are ignored . the average of the metric ( [ recmetric ] ) , then , yields ( upon expanding appropriately the lorentz factors in powers of @xmath125 ) : @xmath126 notice the existence of _ horizons _ in this metric , the xx  metric component vanishes for @xmath127 ( which is consistent with the fact that the velocities are subluminal @xmath128 ) .",
    "the metric ( [ metric2b ] ) has a _",
    "global _ character , as a result of averaging over populations of d - particles that cross the _ entire _ d - brane world .",
    "we next notice that the quantities @xmath129 are in principle time dependent , denoted by @xmath130 , since the density of the d - particle defects may depend on time .",
    "this can happen , for instance , if the bulk density of the d - particles is not uniform .",
    "the nature of the time dependence of @xmath130 is therefore dependent on a microscopic model .",
    "if the _ density _ of the d - particles that cross our brane world ( c.f . fig .  [ fig : recoil ] ) decreases with time , we then have an expanding robertson - walker type universe in the @xmath131 directions , and a static universe in the transverse directions @xmath132 : @xmath133 where the cosmic time  @xmath134 is defined as @xmath135 and the @xmath91 denote the static directions which will not be of relevance to us here .",
    "it is a priori natural to consider an isotropic d - particle foam , in which the d - particles recoil in random directions so that @xmath7 , @xmath136 asymptotically @xmath137 monotonically tends to a constant with @xmath134 .",
    "in such a case one obtains an isotropic robertson - walker like universe . for simplicity in this work",
    "we concentrate on effective two - dimensional universes , since such an assumption will not affect the qualitative features of our approach . in this sense",
    ", the interaction of d - particle foam with stringy matter on brane worlds , leads to an effective space - time metric , felt  by the matter , which , depending on properties of the foam , can have the form of homogeneous and isotropic robertson walker cosmology .",
    "we will use the string theory considerations , leading to ( [ rwrecoil ] ) , as a motivation for studying the possible consequences of our d - particle / string hypothesis for flavour mixing within the context of a simple field theoretic @xmath138 dimensional model with a horizon . before starting , we mention that flavour need not be conserved during the capture process of fig .  [",
    "fig : recoil ] , in the sense that the re - emitted string , after the capture , may have a different flavour ( and mass ) from the incident one .",
    "however , the spatial momentum is conserved in the process . in this sense ,",
    "our d - particle foam may be considered as a medium of inducing flavour _ mixing _",
    "@xcite , which might be a feature of quantum gravity foam@xmath134 in general .    as we shall discuss below",
    ", the effects of flavour changing on the space time are drastic , and result in a `` new fock - space vacuum '' state of the form suggested in @xcite for generic theories with mixing . as we shall discuss in section [ sec : eos ] , this results in non - trivial contributions to the vacuum energy , of cosmological constant type , which come _ mostly _ from the infrared modes of the flavoured particles , of momenta less than the a representative scale of order of the sum of the masses .",
    "these constant ( in time ) contributions imply that , eventually , the flavour - changing process _ dominate _ the simple robertson - walker metric structure ( [ metric2b],[rwrecoil ] ) arising from the d - particle recoil distortions , results in de sitter type universes .",
    "let us consider the metric in @xmath138 dimensions @xcite @xmath139 which in conformal time co - ordinates has the form we have @xmath140 according to our discussion above , we first consider robertson - walker expanding universes , interpolating _",
    "smoothly _ between asymptotically flat space times . in our d - particle - foam picture , leading to ( [ metric2b],[rwrecoil ] ) this can be achieved by considering models of foam in which the density of the d - particles in the bulk is not uniform but varies appropriately in such a way that , as the d3-brane world moves through the population of d - particles ( c.f . fig .",
    "[ fig : recoil ] ) , the effective density of the d - particles crossing the d3 brane varies smoothly with time so as to lead to the above situation of smoothly expanding isotropic universes .",
    "moreover , we assume for simplicity the case in which the fluctuation parameter @xmath141 never reaches the horizon scale 1/2 , but is always kept sufficiently small .",
    "this is only for simplicity , since the essential features of our expanding universe , that would be relevant for our discussion in this work , namely particle production , can already be captured in such horizon - free situation . in any case , as we have already mentioned , and shall discus in section [ sec : eos ] , non - perturbative effects of our flavour vacuum will produce de sitter space times with asymptotic future horizons .",
    "a simple choice for @xmath142 , capturing the above features is @xmath143 with @xmath144 and @xmath145 and has the feature of @xmath142 asymptotically tending to a constant as @xmath146 .",
    "this space time is asymptotically accelerating , for sufficiently negative @xmath147 , and decelerating for positive @xmath148 ; hence there are no asymptotic future cosmic horizons .",
    "this is consistent with the absence of such horizons in perturbative string theory  @xcite , employed in our world - sheet approach to d - particle foam , which is based on well - defined scattering - matrix elements and asymptotic states . in the d - particle picture given above ,",

    "is considered as a _ perturbative _ stringy background on which we shall discuss flavour changing process resulting from the stringy , topologically non - trivial processes of capture in our foam model , depicted in fig .  [",
    "fig : recoil ] . as mentioned above",
    ", such flavour changing process will lead to a new vacuum state , which in turn will imply contributions to the vacuum energy of the universe , of de sitter type , that will eventually dominate the space time ( [ expansion ] ) , leading to eternal acceleration and asymptotic horizons .",
    "this should be considered as a _ non - perturbative _ contribution of the flavour - changing non - trivial vacuum structure of our model .    on the other hand ,",
    "if one would like to use an exactly soluble model , without future horizons , interpolating between a de sitter space time at a certain era in the past and a flat minkowski space time at the future asymptotic end of cosmic time , then ( s)he could consider as an instructive example the following form of the scale factor  @xcite : @xmath155 with the model incorporating the de sitter phase in the far past , @xmath156 for @xmath157 . indeed , for sufficiently negative conformal times , such that @xmath158 , the model implies inflationary evolution , since in that range of parameters @xmath159 on the other hand , in the asymptotic future @xmath160 , the model asymptotes to flat minkowski space time , with @xmath161 .    in what follows",

    "it goes without saying that the above issues are far from being considered as resolved , especially in a string theory context , where the issues of an inflationary phase , and in particular a smooth ( `` graceful '' ) exit from it , are far from being understood analytically . in critical string theory , there are recent attempts towards a construction of exact solutions , incorporating inflation , by making use of the properties of the compact calabi - yau spaces in concrete , phenomenologically semi - realistic ( as far as incorporation of the standard model is concerned ) brane world models  @xcite .",
    "however , the exit phase from the de sitter era , together with attaining the very small value for the vacuum energy observed today , are still not understood , in our opinion",

    "we have calculated the effects of the universe expansion in the flavour - vacuum formalism for a toy model of bosons . by taking into account the details of our specific model involving d - particle defects , we have been able of determining the physically relevant subtraction scheme in the calculation of the flavour - vacuum expectation value of the matter stress - energy tensor . in this way we have obtained an equation of state of cosmological - constant type for ( late ) eras of the universe , where the expansion rate is small .",
    "this is consistent with the constant contributions to the vacuum energy obtained by averaging over the relevant ( small ) time scales in the problem .",
    "although our considerations are toy , as referring to two - dimensional target space time , and hence one can not make direct contact with dark - energy observations , nevertheless , the order of magnitude of this non perturbative contribution ( [ flavourenergy ] ) to the cosmological constant can be made phenomenologically consistent with the small value suggested by observations today , provided the order of magnitude of the recoil - velocity ( statistical ) fluctuations @xmath129 , which it depends upon , is sufficiently small .",
    "moreover , the contribution vanishes if the mass difference or the mixing angle vanish , as expected in the generic approach of blasone and vitiello .",
    "we should extend the above analysis to include fermions , and also we should consider higher - dimensional isotropic universe situations . moreover , despite the motivations from string theory , our considerations have been restricted so far in the context of effective low - energy field theories .",
    "it would be interesting to extend these results to pure stringy considerations and attempt to estimate microscopically the order of the recoil velocity fluctuations , @xmath129 , in realistic models .",
    "such a task is non trivial , as it requires first an understanding of the details of the compactification procedure , consistent with supersymmetry breaking in target space .",
    "flux compactification has been briefly used in our stringy model in the arguments in favour of the identification of the liouville mode of our supercritical recoil string model with a function of target time .",
    "it is our belief that such compactifications provide a way of resolving the problem of the smallness of the dark energy of the universe today consistently with phenomenologically realistic values of supersymmetry - breaking mass scales .",
    "we hope to start tackling such issues in the near future .",
    "a final comment we would like to make concerns the global effect of the induced de sitter space time on photons . according to the analysis in @xcite , in four - dimensional de sitter space times , vacuum polarization of charged scalar fields , such as charged higgs in supersymmetric theories , implies mass for the long wavelength photon modes that cross the horizon @xmath449 of the ( locally ) de sitter space time .",
    "indeed , let @xmath450 denote the momentum of such modes , with @xmath451 initially at some ( conformal ) time @xmath452 , but whose actual ( physical ) magnitude is diminished significantly due to the universe expansion at a later time @xmath431 , after a long period of inflation , @xmath453 , with @xmath454 the scale factor such that @xmath455",
    ". then the induced mass @xmath456 of the photon is , to leading order in the appropriate expansions  @xcite : @xmath457^{1/2 } \\label{photonmass}\\ ] ] where @xmath250 is the fine structure constant . in our case ( [ flavourenergy ] ) ,",
    "the flavour - vacuum - induced hubble parameter is extremely small ( at late eras of the universe ) , of order @xmath458 , and thus only extremely long - wavelength ( far infrared ) photon modes would acquire a ( very small ) mass via the vacuum - polarization mechanism of @xcite . however , in the early universe , our statistical d - particle fluctuations could be much larger , according to the models of d - foam discussed above , and thus one does not exclude the possibility of significant photon masses ( in supersymmetric theories , where charged scalar fields occur naturally ) via this mechanism . as discussed in @xcite , this may produce weak , but of cosmological - scale relevance , _ seed _ magnetic fields , which could be amplified to produce the micro - gauss magnetic fields observed in galaxies and galactic clusters",
    ". it would be interesting to examine such scenarios in the context of our flavour - vacuum induced de sitter space time , as such studies may provide indirect tests of ( and impose constraints on ) space time foam models from novel view points .",
    "we hope to tackle such issues in a forthcoming publication .",
    "this work is partially supported by the european union through the fp6 marie curie research and training network _ universenet _",
    "( mrtn - ct-2006 - 035863 ) .",
    "in this appendix we calculate the quantities @xmath459 , appearing in the appropriately normal - ordered ( subtracted ) expressions ( [ subtraction1 ] ) , ( [ subtraction2 ] ) for the boson stress - energy tensor flavour - vacuum expectation value , for slow universe - expansion rate and small momenta @xmath20 ( with respect to the boson mass ) .",
