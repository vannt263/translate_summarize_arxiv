    "-5 mm    symplectic geometry exhibits a range of intersection phenomena that can not be predicted nor explained on the level of pure topology or differential geometry .",
    "the main players in this game are certain pairs of subspaces ( e.g. lagrangian submanifolds , domains , or a mixture of both ) whose mutual intersections can not be removed ( or reduced ) via the group of hamiltonian or symplectic diffeomorphisms .",
    "the very first examples of such phenomena were conjectures by arnold in the 1960 s , and eventually established and further explored by gromov , floer and others starting from the mid 1980s .",
    "the first part of the paper will survey several intersection phenomena and the mathematical tools leading to their discovery .",
    "we shall not attempt to present the most general results and since the literature is vast the exposition will be far from complete . rather we shall concentrate on various intersection phenomena trying to understand their nature and whether there is any relations between them .    the second part is dedicated to `` non - intersections '' , namely to situations where the principles of symplectic intersections break down . in the case of lagrangian submanifolds",
    "this absence of intersections is reflected in the vanishing of a symplectic invariant called floer homology .",
    "this vanishing when interpreted algebraically leads to restrictions on the topology of lagrangian submanifolds . as a byproduct",
    "we shall explain how these restrictions can be used to study some problems in algebraic geometry concerning hyperplane sections and degenerations .",

    "a local computation shows that @xmath201 can be chosen so that @xmath204 becomes a lagrangian submanifold .",

    "the next observation is that @xmath206 is monotone and moreover its minimal maslov number @xmath207 is the same as the one of @xmath25 . due to our assumptions on @xmath208",
    "this number turns out to satisfy @xmath209 .",
    "the crucial point now is that @xmath210 .",
    "indeed , the symplectic manifold @xmath211 can be completed to be @xmath212 where floer homology vanishes .    having this vanishing we turn to an alternative computation of @xmath213 .",

    "the minimal maslov number has an influence both on the grading as well as on the number of steps it takes the sequence to converge to @xmath214 .",
    "in our case we have a spectral sequence starting with @xmath215 and converging to @xmath210 . a computation through this process together with the information that @xmath216 makes it possible to completely recover @xmath217 .",

    "summarizing the proof , there are three main ingredients :    1 .   transforming the lagrangian @xmath25 into a related lagrangian @xmath226 living in a different manifold such that @xmath226 can be hamiltonianly separated from itself .",
    "consequently we obtain @xmath210 .",

    "we shall not present new results here but rather try to outline a new direction in which symplectic methods can be used in algebraic geometry .",
    "let @xmath205 be a smooth projective variety .",
    "the classical lefschetz theorem provides restrictions on smooth varieties @xmath16 that may contain @xmath205 as their hyperplane section .",
    "it was discovered by sommese  @xcite that there exist projective varieties @xmath205 that can not be hyperplane sections ( or even ample divisors ) in _ any _ smooth variety @xmath16 . for example , sommese proved that abelian varieties of ( complex ) dimension @xmath246 have this property ( see  @xcite for more examples ) .",

    "here is an outline of the proof .",
    "suppose that @xmath253 .",
    "choose a generic line @xmath254 intersecting @xmath255 transversely ( and only at smooth points of @xmath255 ) .",
    "consider the pencil @xmath256 parametrized by @xmath257 . passing to the blow - up @xmath258 of @xmath16 along the base locus of the pencil",
    "we obtain a holomorphic map @xmath259 .",
    "the critical values of @xmath260 are in 1 - 1 correspondence with the point of @xmath261 .",
    "moreover , the fact that @xmath257 intersects @xmath255 transversely implies that @xmath260 is a so called lefschetz fibration , namely each critical point of @xmath260 has non - degenerate ( complex ) hessian ( in other words , locally @xmath260 looks like a holomorphic morse function ) .",
    "the condition @xmath253 ensures that @xmath262 hence at least one of the fibres of @xmath260 is singular .",
    "let @xmath263 be such a fibre and @xmath264 a critical point of @xmath260 .",
    "the important point now is that the vanishing cycle ( corresponding to @xmath265 ) that lies in the nearby smooth fibre @xmath266 can be represented by a ( smooth ) lagrangian sphere . by moser argument",
    "all the smooth divisors in the linear system @xmath267 are symplectomorphic .",
    "in particular @xmath205 has a lagrangian sphere too .",
    "theorem  k can be applied as follows : given a smooth variety @xmath205 , use methods of symplectic geometry to prove that @xmath205 contains no lagrangian spheres , say for any symplectic structure compatible with the complex structure of @xmath205 .",
    "then by theorem  k the only chance for @xmath205 to be a hyperplane section is inside a variety @xmath16 with `` small dual '' , namely @xmath268 .",
    "let us remark that smooth varieties @xmath269 with @xmath252 are quite rare , and have very restricted geometry ( see e.g. zak  @xcite and ein  @xcite ) .",
    "using the theory of `` small dual varieties '' we can either rule out this case or get strong restrictions on the pair @xmath270 .",
    "let us illustrate this on the example mentioned at the beginning of the section .",
    "let @xmath205 be an abelian variety of complex dimension @xmath271 .",
    "note that @xmath205 can not have a lagrangian sphere for any khler form .",
    "indeed , if @xmath205 had such a sphere then the same would hold also for the universal cover of @xmath205 which is symplectomorphic to @xmath99 .",
    "but this is impossible in view of theorem  g. thus if @xmath205 is a hyperplane section of @xmath247 then @xmath252 .",
    "it is well known  @xcite that in this case @xmath16 must have rational curves ( in fact lots of them ) . in particular @xmath272 . by lefschetz s theorem",
    "we get @xmath273 . but",
    "this is impossible since @xmath205 is an abelian variety .",
    "we therefore conclude that @xmath205 can not be a hyperplane section in _ any _ smooth variety @xmath16 .",
    "an analogous ( though symplectically more involved ) argument should apply also to any algebraic variety @xmath205 with @xmath274 and @xmath275 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "an application of more refined symplectic tools ( e.g. methods described in section  4.1 above ) can be used to obtain many more examples .    here is another typical application : let @xmath276 be a projective curve of genus @xmath277 .",
    "it was observed by silva  @xcite that @xmath278 can be realized as a hyperplane section in various smooth varieties .",
    "note that by theorem  j , @xmath278 can not have any lagrangian spheres .",
    "it immediately follows that the only smooth varieties @xmath16 that support @xmath279 as their hyperplane section must have small dual . for @xmath280 results of ein",
    "@xcite make it even possible to list all such @xmath16 s .",
    "we conclude with a remark on the methods .",
    "the symplectic approach outlined above gives coarser results .",
    "indeed sommese  @xcite provides examples of varieties that can not be ample divisors whereas the methods above only rule out the possibility of being very ample . on the other hand",
    "the symplectic approach has an advantage in its robustness with respect to small deformations ( see  @xcite , c.f .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the methods of the previous section can also be used to study degenerations of algebraic varieties .",
    "let @xmath281 be a smooth projective variety .",
    "we say that @xmath281 admits a khler degeneration with isolated singularities if there exists a khler manifold @xmath16 and a proper holomorphic map @xmath282 to the unit disc @xmath283 with the following properties :    1 .",
    "every @xmath284 is a regular value of @xmath260 ( hence , all the fibres @xmath285 , @xmath286 , are smooth khler manifolds ) .",
    "2 .   @xmath287 is a critical value of @xmath260 and all the critical points of @xmath260 are isolated .",
    "@xmath281 is isomorphic ( as a complex manifold ) to one of the smooth fibres of @xmath260 , say @xmath288 , @xmath289 .    as in the previous section this situation",
    "is related to symplectic geometry through the lagrangian vanishing cycle construction .",
    "as pointed out by seidel  @xcite one can locally morsify each of the critical points in @xmath290 and then by applying moser s argument obtain for each critical point of @xmath260 at least one lagrangian sphere in the nearby fibre @xmath266 .",
    "since all the smooth fibres are symplectomorphic we obtain lagrangian spheres also in @xmath281 .    applying results from section  4 to this situation",
    "we obtain examples of projective varieties that do not admit _ any _ degeneration with isolated singularities .",
    "for example , let @xmath281 be any of the following :    * @xmath36 , @xmath291 . or more generally @xmath243 , where @xmath39 is a smooth variety with @xmath80 and @xmath292 .",
    "* any variety whose universal cover is @xmath99 , ( @xmath293 ) , or a domain in @xmath99 .",
    "this point of view seems non - trivial especially when @xmath294 , where @xmath295 . in these cases the vanishing cycles are zero in homology and",
    "it seems that there are no obvious topological obstructions for degenerating @xmath281 as above . from the list above",
    ", the first non - trivial example should be @xmath36 with @xmath296 .",
    "it would be interesting to figure out to which extent the above statement could be proved within the tools of pure algebraic geometry .",
    "note that lagrangian spheres are a non - algebraic object and it seems that their existence / non - existence can not be formalized in purely algebro - geometric terms .",
    "another direction of applications should be to find an upper bound on the number of singular points of an algebraic variety @xmath263 that can be obtained from a degeneration of @xmath281 .",
    "note that the vanishing cycles of different singular points of @xmath263 are disjoint .",
    "thus the idea here is to obtain an upper bound on the number of possible disjoint lagrangian spheres that can be embedded in @xmath281 .",
    "the simplest test case here should be the quadric @xmath297 , where @xmath271 .",
    "clearly @xmath298 can be degenerated to a variety @xmath263 with isolated singularities ( e.g. to a cone over a smaller dimensional quadric ) .",
    "it seems reasonable to expect that in every such degeneration the singular fibre @xmath263 will have only one singular point .",
    "note that for @xmath299 this easily follows from topological reason but it may not be so when @xmath296 because @xmath300 . from a symplectic point of view",
    "the above statement would follow if we could prove that every two lagrangian spheres in @xmath298 must intersect .",
    "this is currently still unknown but there are evidences supporting this conjecture  @xcite .",
    "it is likely that a refinement of the methods from  @xcite would be useful for this purpose .",
    "more generally , one could try to bound the number of singular fibres in a degeneration of other hypersurfaces @xmath301 ( in terms of @xmath302 and @xmath72 ) .",
