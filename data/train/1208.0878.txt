    "when the supersonic solar wind plasma from the sun encounters an obstacle , a bow shock is formed .",
    "the incoming solar wind particles ( electrons and ions ) upstream from the bow shock have no information about the obstacle , except in a region magnetically connected to it .",
    "this region is known as the foreshock . at the bow shock ,",
    "a small fraction of the solar wind particles are reflected in the sunward direction .",
    "these backstreaming particles are subjected to the solar wind s * * e**@xmath3*b * drift , where * * e**@xmath4**v**@xmath5**b**@xmath6 , is the solar wind s convective electric field , * b * is the interplanetary magnetic field ( imf ) , @xmath7 is the solar wind velocity and @xmath8 is the speed of light .",
    "the * * e**@xmath3*b * drift velocity is the same for all backstreaming particles , and perpendicular to the imf . as a result ,",
    "the guiding centers of all backstreaming particles move within the @xmath7-*b * plane , gradually drifting away from the field line tangent to the bow shock toward the inner part of the foreshock and being segregated according to their parallel velocities .",
    "electrons , because of their much smaller inertia , are much less affected by this drift and their presence can be detected right next to the field line tangent to the bow shock .",
    "the combination of solar wind and energetic backstreaming electrons results in the production of langmuir waves at the electron plasma frequency @xcite .",
    "backstreaming ions on the other hand , can drive a number of plasma instabilities @xcite , leading to the generation of waves .",
    "the ion foreshock is then characterized not just by the presence of a small fraction of backstreaming ions , but also by the generation and propagation of plasma waves around the local ion cyclotron frequency .",
    "the understanding of planetary foreshocks is far from complete .",
    "the most studied case is the earth s foreshock , which is reasonably well understood thanks to single and multi - spacecraft measurements @xcite .",
    "the first observations from the earth s foreshock were made by the dual spacecraft isee @xcite which identified different types of backstreaming ion distributions : reflected ( now called field - aligned beams ) , intermediate , and diffuse @xcite .",
    "the classification of backstreaming ion populations into these three types was made on the basis of two - dimensional velocity distribution functions and energy - time spectrograms .",
    "further results from isee demonstrated the existence of gyrophase - bunched and gyrotropic backstreaming ion distributions in the foreshock @xcite .",
    "the field - aligned distributions are typically observed at and near the leading edge of the ion foreshock without the presence of waves @xcite . behind the field - aligned beam region , gyrophase - bunched distributions",
    "are detected , while diffuse distributions are found even farther away ( i.e. downstream ) from the ion foreshock boundary .",
    "the association of different linear and non - linear waves to different ion distributions was first studied by @xcite .",
    "gyrophase - bunched and diffuse distributions are in fact observed in the presence of ultra - low frequency ( ulf ) waves . in particular , gyrophase - bunched distributions coexist with ulf quasi - monochromatic waves with substantial amplitudes ( @xmath9 ) @xcite .",
    "the production of gyrophase - bunched ions and associated ulf waves has been studied numerically @xcite , theoretically @xcite and observationally , using data from wind spacecraft @xcite . on the other hand , non - linear ,",
    "steepened waves have been found to be associated with diffuse ion distributions @xcite .",
    "evidence of foreshocks has also been found in other planets as well . in the case of mars ,",

    "plasma waves have also been detected upstream from mercury s bow shock using mariner 10 measurements @xcite .",
    "a brief review on mercury s foreshock was made by @xcite .",
    "the region of ulf wave activity is embedded in the ion foreshock , and its boundary is known as the ulf wave foreshock boundary . in the case of the earth , @xcite located this boundary in a statistical way by using combined magnetic field and plasma data from heos 1 .",

    "other studies have shown that for @xmath14 cone angles , there is a well defined upstream boundary , and this boundary intersects the bow shock at @xmath15 @xcite . using multi - spacecraft data obtained by cluster , @xcite presented two case studies on the onset of ulf foreshock waves , relating their appearance to changes in the orientation of the imf .",
    "the increased wave activity is associated with the change in @xmath1 to quasi - parallel geometries ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "these findings are consistent with previous single spacecraft studies .",
    "although the observations at earth represent a vital element in the study of the physical processes occurring on planetary foreshocks at large , these phenomena necessarily occur at the particular parameter values relevant for our planet .",
    "to explore how these processes change in parameter space , it is just as important to make in situ observations around other planets .",

    "they concluded that these oxygen upstream events must be particles leaking from saturn s magnetosphere under favorable imf conditions .",
    "however , @xcite studied 45 hours of mass - resolved observations of cassini plasma spectrometer ( caps ) , which were performed upstream from saturn s bow shock .",

    "the distance of each plane to the planet is labeled in units of @xmath37.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    therefore , we decided to study the consistency of our linear best fit in the @xmath72-@xmath73 plane and the curve corresponding to @xmath89 . assuming a constant @xmath99 ( the magnetic field lines lay in the @xmath100-@xmath101 plane ) and parameter size @xmath97 51 @xmath98 , we computed the ( @xmath72,@xmath73 ) pair for the location of the point that satisfies @xmath89 at different ( parallel ) @xmath62-@xmath63 planes ( see figure [ fig : trian ] )",
    "the corresponding distance of each plane ( in units of @xmath37 ) to the planet is labeled .",
    "we can clearly see in figure [ fig : trian ] an approximate proportionality between the @xmath72-@xmath73 coordinates at any given plane .",
    "this implies that if cassini crossed right at the intersection between the bow shock and the @xmath89 field line , we should expect a straight line passing through the origin in the @xmath72-@xmath73 plane ( see figure [ fig : sigma1 ] ) .",
    "the fact that cassini crosses that very field line necessarily at a distance from that intersection toward the upstream direction , causes a systematic increase in the value of @xmath72 , leaving @xmath73 essentially unchanged .",
    "the distance from the bow shock measured along field lines range between @xmath102 and @xmath103 for the 21 crossings considered . on the one hand",
    ", this effect will reduce the quality of the linear fit , and on the other hand it will shift the line on the @xmath72-@xmath73 plane to the right ( negative intercept ) , exactly as observed in figure [ fig : sigma1 ] .",
    "all the wave events detected by cassini s magnetometer show evidence of magnetic connectivity to saturn s bow shock , which is a clear indication that these waves are associated with saturn s foreshock . in absence of a reliable physical model of the bow shock",
    ", we used the empirical model of @xcite , which is based on extensive observations from cassini made during the same time span of our work ( 15 months from june 2004 through august 2005 ) . assuming that the bow shock is axially symmetric about the solar wind flow direction , the average bow shock location is obtained by fitting a conic section to the bow shock crossings using a nonlinear least squares technique .",
    "this fit provides an adequate description of the average shape , given by an eccentricity of @xmath40 , and also that of its average location , corresponding to @xmath104 . in our study",
    ", we assume that the shape of saturn s bow shock remains constant throughout our observational time span , while its location varies in response to time variations of the solar wind s ram pressure .",
    "in other words , for each wave event or ulf wave foreshock boundary crossing , we assumed @xmath38 to remain constant .",
    "meanwhile , the semilatus rectum @xmath37 , which determines the distance of the bow shock to the planet , was allowed to change to account for this pressure effect .",
    "we found values of @xmath37 between @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "we also calculated the parameter size using an average between the two closest bow shock crossing locations for a given event ( wave or crossing ) .",
    "for the sake of comparison , we also made our calculation assuming that the parameter size remains constant ( @xmath107 , which is the average value ) for all the wave events .",
    "we found , that the bow shock fit was not representative of many of the upstream events studied , since they fell in the downstream region of this static fit .",
    "therefore , we concluded that the bow shock fit calculated using equation with a varying @xmath37 parameter gives a more accurate empirical representation of the real kronian bow shock .    for all the wave events observed , we performed a preliminary characterization based on their frequency and polarization as measured in the spacecraft reference frame .",
    "according to their frequencies , we observe two different types of oscillations .",
    "waves with frequencies below @xmath0 are the most frequently observed , they are phase steepened with periods of the order of 5 to 10 minutes in the spacecraft frame . as we mentioned in section [ ulf - waves ] , we saw steepening fronts located at the right of waves with a higher frequency wave packets attached to them .",
    "we also note a decrease in amplitude and in the period of the oscillations within each wave packet with increasing distance from the steepening front .",
    "the angle between the minimum variance vector and the mean magnetic field suggests that the propagation of these waves is quasi - parallel .",
    "the magnetic field rotation around the minimum variance direction is left - handed with respect to the imf direction . as was discussed in @xcite",
    ", these signatures suggest that these waves are ion / ion resonant right - hand ( fast magnetosonic ) mode waves which steepen during the nonlinear regime and emit a dispersive whistler to stop the steepening .",
    "we also observe waves with frequencies above @xmath0 , which are either quasi - monochromatic or steepened , with periods of the order of 60 s ( significantly lower than the local proton cyclotron period t@xmath108 s ) .",
    "for the quasi - monochromatic events , their corresponding hodograms show that the polarization is circular right - handed with respect to the mean magnetic field .",
    "the angle between the ambient magnetic field and the minimum variance direction reveals that these waves propagate in a slightly oblique direction with respect to the imf orientation .",
    "this kind of wave packets is an exception rather than the rule ( we found ten events only ) . at the earth",
    "s foreshock , there is a particular type of ulf waves , the so - called 30 s ( period ) waves which are quasi - monochromatic ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this kind of waves are found always near to the ulf wave foreshock boundary . in our study",
    "we did not find quasi - monochromatic waves next to the saturnian ulf wave foreshock boundary .",
    "a more detailed statistical study would shed some light about the nature of this second group of waves and whether they are the saturnian equivalent of the 30 s modes found in the earth s foreshock .",
    "when cassini is magnetically connected to the bow shock fit by straight magnetic field lines ( since we are assuming a uniform external magnetic field ) , we identify the intersection point between the field line and the bow shock fit as well as the angle @xmath1 . in all the crossings that we observed ,",
    "we find that the presence of magnetic fluctuations is associated with values of @xmath1 corresponding to quasi - parallel geometries ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "this result is fully consistent with the one obtained by @xcite at earth .",
    "using isee data , they examined the presence of ulf waves in the region immediately upstream from the earth s bow shock .",
    "their statistical study shows a well - defined boundary on the @xmath7-*b * plane , separating the disturbed from the undisturbed magnetic field at @xmath109 .",
    "our result for saturn s foreshock is consistent with this scenario , regardless of whether these waves are immediately adjacent to the bow shock or deep into the foreshock region .",
    "@xcite developed a theoretical framework for studying the general trajectories of ions reflected or leaked upstream from the earth s bow shock and subjected only to the lorenz force in a steady imf . in the case known as specular reflection , the ions bounce off the shock potential reversing their velocity component along the shock normal @xmath110 , while maintaining their parallel component . in the de",
    "hoffman - teller frame @xcite , assuming that the bow shock is infinitesimally thin and has no overshoot , @xcite found that after interacting with the shock , the guiding center motion of incident solar wind ions is reflected to the upstream region with @xmath16 .",
    "for @xmath20 , specularly reflected ions always re - encounter the bow shock with sufficient energy to penetrate into the downstream region .",
    "it is worth mentioning that these specularly reflected ions oriented to the upstream region for quasi - parallel geometries would have no conserving magnetic moment , in contrast with the field - aligned reflected beams , for which there is a magnetic moment conservation @xcite . in the absence of cassini plasma observations that could confirm the presence of backstreaming ions giving rise to an ion foreshock region , we can not observationally associate the presence of waves with specific ion distributions .",
    "however , if the mechanism of generation of these waves is local , i.e. the wave growth rate @xmath111 is sufficiently large , we could expect specularly reflected ions to be responsible for these waves since they are the only population whose spatial distribution depends on @xmath1 . in this case , for quasi - parallel geometries , the reflected ions can go upstream from the bow shock and be detectes through ulf wave activity .",
    "nevertheless , a full discussion on the wave generation caused by particle distributions as a function of @xmath1 , is beyond the purpose of this study .    for a correct determination of saturn s ulf wave foreshock boundary , we only considered crossings in which cassini was entering or leaving the wave zone under steady imf conditions , i.e. stationary crossings .",
    "we defined a criterion based on the variability of the magnetic field in order to make a proper identification of these stationary crossings . as a result , we reduced our original list of crossings to only 21 stationary ones . at earth , using single spacecraft techniques , @xcite obtained different orientations of ulf wave foreshock boundary for different cone angles ( more specifically , they considered two ranges : @xmath112 - @xmath113 and @xmath12 - @xmath13 ) . in agreement with parker s angle prediction for saturn @xcite , our study shows that 83% of the crossings correspond to cone angles larger than 55@xmath17 .",
    "therefore , the range of @xmath99 considered is different to that at earth .",
    "nevertheless , we analyzed the correlation between @xmath72-@xmath73 coordinates for two ranges of @xmath99 : one set of data with @xmath114 and the other with @xmath115 .",
    "a comparison of the best linear fit for the two data set indicates no significant difference between them ( see figure [ fig : sigma1 ] ) .",
    "this result , however , does not rule out a dependence on @xmath116 since the errors in the determination of @xmath72-@xmath73 become larger with decreasing @xmath99 .",
    "more specifically , the main source of error propagation in the determination of each ( @xmath74 ) pair is the intersection point between the tangent imf line and the bow shock fit .",
    "this intersection point depends critically on the imf cone angle , which is therefore the main source of error . in particular , small cone angles correspond to almost tangent magnetic field lines close to the asymptotes of the hyperbola . on the other hand ,",
    "the appearance of waves is observed to occur at @xmath1 values of @xmath117 .",
    "the surface determined by the condition @xmath89 is mapped on the @xmath72-@xmath73 plane as straight line , as illustrated by figure [ fig : trian ] . as a result",
    ", we find that there is an equivalence between the ulf wave foreshock boundary determined by @xmath118 and the best fit in the @xmath72-@xmath73 plane citepgb1986 .",
    "they are in fact two alternative ways to determine the same spatial region within the foreshock .",
    "finally , we studied the robustness of the @xmath72-@xmath73 correlation as our selection criterion becomes more stringent .",
    "for instance , we change the 1.@xmath58 condition to a more stringent value of 1/2.@xmath58 for the three components of magnetic field , or change it into the less restrictive value of 3/2@xmath59 for each component .",
    "we find that regardless of whether we choose a more or less restrictive criterion , our best fit remains the same , within the fit errors .",
    "we also find that for these three different criteria , the boundary does not seem to depend on whether the cone angle is large or small .",
    "using cassini s data from soi in june 2004 through august 2005 , we conducted a detailed survey and analysis of ulf waves upstream from saturn s bow shock .",
    "all the wave events show evidence of magnetic connectivity to saturn s bow shock , therefore we conclude that these wave events are undoubtedly associated with saturn s foreshock .    as for their frequencies , we identify two distinct types of wave populations .",
    "the most frequently observed have frequencies below @xmath0 and are phase steepened , with periods of the order of 5 to 10 minutes in the spacecraft frame .",
    "these waves are often accompanied by precursor whistler wave trains . in agreement with previous works",
    ", we suggest that these waves are ion / ion resonant right - hand ( fast magnetosonic ) mode waves which steepen during the nonlinear regime and emit a dispersive whistler to stop the steepening .",
    "we also observe waves with frequencies above @xmath0 , which appear as either quasi - monochromatic or steepened , with periods of @xmath47 1 minute .",
    "the quasi - monochromatic events have a circular right - handed polarization with respect to the mean magnetic field and a propagation slightly oblique with respect to the imf .",
    "a more detailed study will be needed in order to conclude whether the latter are the saturnian equivalent of the 30 s modes found at earth .",
    "it is worth noticing that we have identified the same two categories than @xcite have found , although for a much bigger cassini mag s data set .",
    "we identified 21 stationary crossings inbound and outbound from the ulf wave foreshock region .",
    "we calculated their solar foreshock coordinates in the @xmath62-@xmath63 plane and we have identified for the first time saturn s ulf wave foreshock boundary . in the @xmath72-@xmath73 plane",
    "we do not find a clear dependence between the foreshock boundary and the imf cone angle .",
    "we also found that the presence of waves is associated with the change in @xmath1 to quasi - parallel geometries .",
    "moreover , we find that our determination of the ulf wave foreshock boundary as the surface given by @xmath89 , is indeed consistent with the linear fit in the @xmath72-@xmath73 plane , first proposed by @xcite for the earth s ulf wave foreshock . in this regard , we speculate that the specular reflection is the candidate process for the reflected ions ( gyrophase - bunched and diffuse distributions ) , since it is the only process to produce a signature in @xmath1 . finally , we studied the robustness of the @xmath72-@xmath73 correlation for a more restrictive criterion .",
    "we found that regardless of the criterion that we use , we obtain the same ulf wave foreshock boundary in the @xmath72-@xmath73 plane ."
