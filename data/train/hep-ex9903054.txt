    "the atlas collaboration is building a general - purpose pp detector which is designed to exploit the full discovery potential of the cern s large hadron collider ( lhc ) , a super - conducting ring to provide proton ",
    "proton collisions around 14 tev @xcite .",
    "lhc will open up new physics horizons , probing interactions between proton constituents at the 1 tev level , where new behavior is expected to reveal key insights into the underlying mechanisms of nature @xcite .",
    "the bulk of the hadronic calorimetry in the atlas detector is provided by a large ( 11 m in length , 8.5 m in outer diameter , 2 m in thickness , 10000 readout channels ) scintillating tile hadronic barrel calorimeter ( tilecal ) .",
    "the technology for this calorimeter is based on a sampling technique using steel absorber material and scintillating plates readout by wavelength shifting fibres .",
    "an innovative feature of this design is the orientation of the scintillating tiles which are placed in planes perpendicular to the colliding beams staggered in depth @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ f2 - 28tp ] ) .    in order to test this concept five 1 m prototype modules and the module-0 were built and exposed to high energy pion , electron and muon beams at the cern super proton synchrotron .    in the following we consider two test beam setups .",
    "the setup 1 , shown in fig .  3 - 1 given in @xcite , consists of five 1 m prototype modules .",
    "the obtained results about the electron and pion responses and the @xmath0 ratio @xcite for this setup are used in this paper for comparison .",
    "the setup in question ( setup 2 ) , shown in fig .",
    "3 - 2 given in @xcite , has as the basis module-0 .    in this work",
    "the detailed experimental information is presented about the electron and pion responses and the @xmath6 and @xmath0 ratios ( an intrinsic non - compensation ) of the tile calorimeter module-0 .",
    "each module spans 100 cm in the @xmath2 direction , 180 cm in the @xmath7 direction ( about 9 interaction lengths at @xmath8 or about 80 effective radiation lengths ) and with a front face of 100 @xmath9 20 @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the iron structure of each module consists of 57 repeated `` periods '' .",
    "each period is 18  mm thick and consists of four layers .",
    "the first and third layers are formed by large trapezoidal steel plates ( master plates ) , and spanning the full longitudinal dimension of the module . in the second and fourth layers , smaller trapezoidal steel plates ( spacer plates ) and scintillator tiles alternate along the @xmath7 direction .",
    "these layers consist of 18 different trapezoids of steel or scintillator , each spanning 100 mm along x.    the master plates , spacer plates and scintillator tiles are 5 mm , 4 mm and 3 mm thick , respectively .",
    "the iron to scintillator ratio is 4.67:1 by volume .",
    "wavelength shifting fibres collect scintillation light from the tiles at both of their open edges and bring it to photo - multipliers ( pmts ) at the periphery of the calorimeter .",
    "each pmt views a specific group of tiles through the corresponding bundle of fibres .",
    "the modules are longitudinally segmented into four depth segments by grouping fibers from different tiles . as a result",
    ", each module is divided into @xmath11 separate cells .",
    "the readout cells have the lateral dimensions @xmath12 ( along y , depending on a depth number ) and the longitudinal dimensions 300 , 400 , 500 , 600 mm for depths 1  4 , corresponding to 1.5 , 2 , 2.5 and 3 @xmath13 at @xmath14 . at the output",
    "we have 200 values of responses @xmath15 from pmt properly calibrated @xcite with pedestal subtracted , for each event . here @xmath16 is the column of cells ( tower ) number , @xmath17 is the module number , @xmath18 is the depth number and @xmath19 is the pmt number .",
    "the layout of the readout cell geometry for the module-0 is shown in fig .",
    "3 - 3 given in @xcite .",
    "the module-0 has three depth segmentations .",
    "the thickness of the module-0 at @xmath20 is 1.5 @xmath21 in the first depth sampling , 4.2 @xmath21 in the second and 1.9 @xmath21 in the third with a total depth of 7.6 @xmath21 .",
    "the module-0 samples the shower with 11 tiles varying in depth from 97 to 187 mm .",
    "the front face area is of @xmath22 .    in the setup 2",
    "( see fig.3 - 2 given in @xcite ) the 1 m prototype modules are placed on a scanning table on top and at the bottom of the module-0 with a 10 cm gap between them .",
    "this scanning table allowed movement in any direction .",
    "upstream of the calorimeter , a trigger counter telescope ( s1-s3 ) was installed , defining a beam spot of 2  cm in diameter .",
    "two delay - line wire chambers ( bc1-bc2 ) , each with @xmath2 , @xmath23 readout , allowed the impact point of beam particles on the calorimeter face to be reconstructed to better than @xmath24  mm @xcite .",
    "a helium erenkov threshold counter was used to tag @xmath25-mesons and electrons for @xmath1 = 10 and 20 @xmath26 .",
    "for the measurements of the hadronic shower longitudinal and lateral leakages back ( @xmath27 ) and side ( @xmath28 ) `` muon walls '' were placed behind and on the side of the calorimeter .",
    "data were taken with electron and pion beam of e = 10 , 20 , 60 , 80 , 100 and 180 gev at @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the following 6 cuts were used .",
    "the cuts 1 and 2 removed beam halo .",
    "the cut 3 removed muons and non - single - track events .",
    "the cuts 4 , 5 and 6 carried out the electron - pion separation the cut 4 is connected with erenkov counter amplitude .",
    "cut 5 is the relative shower energy deposition in the first two calorimeter depths : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and the indexes @xmath31 and @xmath32 in @xmath15 determine the regions of electromagnetic shower development .",
    "the values @xmath33 depend on a particle s entry angle @xmath3 .",
    "the basis for the electron - hadron separation by using the cut 5 is the very different longitudinal energy deposition for electrons and hadrons .",
    "the cut 6 is related with the lateral shower spread @xcite : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the used cells number .",
    "the power parameter @xmath37 have been tuned in @xcite to achieve maximum separation efficiency .",
    "the distributions of events as a function of @xmath33 and @xmath38 for various energies at @xmath4 and @xmath39 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fv29 ] and fig .",
    "[ fv23 ] shows the scatter plots @xmath38 versus @xmath33 .",
    "two groups of events are clearly separated : the left group corresponds to pions , the right group corresponds to electrons .",
    "as to the electron response our calorimeter is very complicated object . it may be imagined as a continuous set of calorimeters with the variable absorber and scintillator thicknesses ( from @xmath40 = 58 to 28 mm and from @xmath41 = 12 to 6 mm for @xmath42 ) , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the thicknesses of absorber and scintillator respectively .",
    "therefore an electron response ( @xmath43 ) is rather complicated function of @xmath44 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 . the energy response spectrum for given run ( beam has the transversal spread @xmath45 ) as a rule is non - gaussian ( fig .",
    "[ fv34 ] and fig .",
    "[ fv35 ] ) , since it is a superposition of different response spectra , but it becomes gaussian for given e , @xmath3 , z values .",
    "[ fv36 ] and fig .",
    "[ fv37 ] show the normalized electron response for e = 10 , 20 , 60 , 80 , 100 , 180 gev at @xmath4 and @xmath5 as a function of the impact point @xmath2 coordinate .",
    "one can see the clear periodical structure of the response with 18  mm period .",
    "the mean values ( parameter @xmath46 ) and the amplitudes(parameter @xmath47 ) of these spectra have been extracted by fitting the sine function : @xmath48    fig .",
    "[ fv27 ] ( top ) shows the parameter @xmath47 as a function of the beam energy .",
    "as can be seen this parameter does not depend from the beam energy within errors and decreases with increasing of @xmath49 from @xmath50 at @xmath4 to @xmath51 at @xmath39 .",
    "[ fv27 ] ( bottom ) shows the mean normalized electron response as a function of energy for two values of @xmath49 . as can be seen",
    "there is some increase of the mean normalized electron response with increasing of energy .",
    "there is no difference between ones for various values of @xmath49 .",
    "note that there are the additional systematic errors in these values ( not given in this figure ) due to the uncertainties in the average beam energies .",
    "these uncertainties are determined by the expression @xmath52 and range from 2.5 % for @xmath53 gev to 0.5 % for @xmath54 gev .",
    "we attempted to explain the electron response as a function of @xmath2 coordinate calculating the total number of shower electrons ( positrons ) crossing scintillator tiles taking into account the arrangement of tiles and its sizes and using the shower curve ( the number of particles in the shower @xmath55 as a function of the longitudinal shower development ) . which is given in @xcite .",
    "these calculations were performed for some energies and angles for the trajectories entering into four different elements of calorimeter periodic structure  spacer , master , tile , master .",
    "the results for e = 10 , 100 , 180 gev at @xmath4 are shown in fig .",
    "there is a maximum at the impact point corresponding to tile and a minimum at the spacer plate .",
    "such simple calculations are in agreement with experimental data as to non - dependence from energy and the periodicity in the electron response .",
    "but these calculations do not reproduce the values of the amplitude .",
    "the latter is connected with non - taking into account the shower lateral spread .",
    "the relative electron energy resolutions , extracted from the energy distributions ( fig .  [ fv34 ] and fig .  [ fv35 ] ) , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fv11 ] together with the 1 m prototype data as a function of @xmath56 .",
    "fit of these data by the expression ( [ qs ] ) produced the parameters @xmath57 and @xmath58 given in table  [ tb11 ] together with the data for various iron - scintillator calorimeters .",
    "we compared our results on the energy resolution with the parameterization suggested in @xcite : @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 = 0.62 , @xmath63 = 0.21 are the parameters , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the radiation lengths of iron and scintillator respectively . in our case",
    "the values of @xmath40 and @xmath41 are equal to : @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "this formula is purely empirical and the parameters @xmath68 were determined by fitting the monte carlo data .",
    "the results of calculations are given in table  [ tb11 ] .",
    "as can be seen from this table the energy resolutions obtained for `` ideal '' calorimeter are more accurate ( about a factor 1.5 ) than the experimental ones .",
    "fig .  [ fv40 ] shows the normalized pion response ( @xmath69 ) for @xmath44 = 20 , 100 , 180 gev at @xmath4 and @xmath5 . fig .",
    "[ fv41 ] shows the normalized pion response for @xmath44 = 20 , 100 , 180 gev at @xmath4 and @xmath5 as a function of impact point @xmath2 coordinate .",
    "contrary to electrons these pion z - dependences do not show any significant periodical structure .",
    "[ fv42 ] shows the mean normalized pion response , extracted from fig .",
    "[ fv41 ] , as a function of energy for two values of @xmath49 .",
    "the meaning of lines is given below .",
    "as can be expected , since the @xmath6 ratio is not equal to 1 , the mean normalized pion response increases with the beam energy increasing .",
    "as can be seen the pion response is different for various @xmath49 .",
    "the values of the pion response for @xmath39 are larger than ones for @xmath4 .",
    "we tried to explain if the reason of this difference is the lateral leakage through gaps between the 1 m prototype modules .",
    "we estimated the lateral leakages to the gaps taking into account the longitudinal energy deposition and the spatial radial deposition .",
    "it turned out that the leakage for @xmath4 is larger than for @xmath39 but it is unsufficient , less than 1 % , in order to explain the observed difference in the pion responses .",
    "the responses obtained for @xmath70 and @xmath25 give the possibility to determine the @xmath0 ratio , an intrinsic non - compensation of a calorimeter . in our case the electron ",
    "pion ratios reveal complicated structures @xmath71 .",
    "[ fv30 ] and fig .",
    "[ fv31 ] show the @xmath72 ratios for module-0 for e = 10 , 20 , 60 , 80 , 100 and 180 gev at @xmath4 and @xmath5 as a function of @xmath2 coordinate .",
    "if for the 1 m prototype modules the local compensation has been observed ( for some @xmath2 points at 20 gev and @xmath73 , see fig .  4 given in @xcite ) as to the module-0 this is not this case .",
    "the @xmath72 ratios , averaged over two 18 mm period , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fv4 ] as a function of the beam energy .",
    "the errors include statistical errors and a systematic error of 1 % , added in quadrature .    for extracting the @xmath0 ratio we have used two methods : the standard @xmath6 method and the pion response method .",
    "in the first method , the relation between the @xmath0 ratio and the @xmath6 ratio is : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the average fraction of the energy of the incident hadron going into @xmath76 production @xcite .    in the second method ,",
    "the relation between the @xmath0 ratio and the pion response , @xmath77 , is : @xmath78 where @xmath70 is the efficiency for the electron detecting .",
    "note that usually this is two parameters fit @xcite with parameters @xmath70 and @xmath0 . in principle",
    ", the @xmath70 value can be determined from the ratio @xmath79 .",
    "there are two analytic forms for the intrinsic @xmath80 fraction suggested by groom @xcite @xmath81 and wigmans @xcite @xmath82 where @xmath83 gev , @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "we used both parameterizations .",
    "[ fv4 ] shows the @xmath72 ratio as a function of the beam energy for module-0 and its fitting of equation ( [ ev1 ] ) with the wigmans ( groom ) parameterization of @xmath86 .",
    "[ fv42 ] shows the pion response as a function of the beam energy for the module-0 and its fitting of equation ( [ ev2 ] ) with the wigmans ( solid line ) and groom ( dashed line ) parameterizations of @xmath86 .",
    "the confidence levels of the fits for these parameterizations are good , i.e. , @xmath87 is less then the numbers of degrees of freedom .",
    "so , we could obtain four values for the @xmath0 ratio .",
    "the results are presented in table  [ tv8 ] .",
    "as can be seen , the @xmath0 ratios obtained by the pion response method have the errors about 10 times larger than obtained by the @xmath72 method . in addition",
    ", there is some systematic difference : the @xmath0 ratios , obtained by the pion response method , are of 20  40 % larger than ones , obtained by the @xmath72 method .",
    "this can be explained by some increase in the electron response in the 60  180 gev energy range .",
    "this systematic is cancelled in the @xmath72 method .",
    "it is remarkable that in @xcite , in which the @xmath0 ratio for the 1 m prototype modules have been determined , obtained the contrary result concerning advantages in using these methods .",
    "advantage have been observed for the pion response method .",
    "in their case the standard @xmath72 method led to a larger error ( about a factor 2 ) than the pion response method called in this work the non - linearity method .",
    "this can be explained by different scale of errors in the corresponding input data . in their work",
    "the @xmath72 ratios had 3 % errors and the pion response values had 0.3 % errors . in our case , errors in the @xmath72 ratios and the pion response values have errors at the same 1 % level .",
    "we made preference to the @xmath72 method and our final results are : @xmath88 for @xmath4 and @xmath89 for @xmath39 .",
    "[ fv20 ] shows these values together with ones for the 1 m prototype modules as a function of @xmath3 angle .",
    "the difference in @xmath3 behavior is observed .",
    "this can be explained by different behaviour for the electron and pion responses as a function of @xmath3 for these two calorimeters as shown in fig .",
    "[ fv21 ] . for the module-0",
    "it is observed slight decrease of the electron response and some increase of the pion response . as a result of",
    "the @xmath90 ratio has 6 % decrease .",
    "the simple calculations of the responses by counting of the energy depositions in crossing tiles along the shower axes taking into account the arrangement and sizes of tiles and the longitudinal shower profiles confirmed these observations .    the obtained @xmath0 values are given in table  [ tv2 ] with the other existing experimental data and the monte carlo calculations for various iron - scintillator calorimeters .",
    "the corresponding values of the thickness of the iron absorber ( @xmath40 ) , the thickness of the readout scintillator layers ( @xmath41 ) , the ratio @xmath91 and the used symbols are also given .",
    "these @xmath0 values are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fv5 ] as a function of @xmath92 ratio and the iron thickness .",
    "as can be seen the @xmath0 ratio has very complicated behaviour being the function of the thickness of the passive ( iron ) layers , the sampling fraction and , in our case , from the @xmath3 angle and the sizes and replacement of the scintillator tiles .    besides , the considerable disagreement between different monte carlo calculations @xcite , @xcite and experimental data is observed .",
