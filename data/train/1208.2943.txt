    "at the core of lyapunov stability theory is the realization that a pointwise geometric condition is sufficient to quantify how solutions of a differential equation approach a specific solution .",
    "the geometric condition checks that the lyapunov function , a certain distance from a given point to the target solution , is doomed to decay along the solution stemming from that point . by integration",
    ", the pointwise decay of the lyapunov function forces the asymptotic convergence to the target solution .",
    "the basic theorem of lyapunov has led to many developments over the last century , that eventually make the body of textbooks on nonlinear systems theory and nonlinear control @xcite .",
    "yet many questions of nonlinear systems theory call for an incremental version of the lyapunov stability concept , in which the convergence to a specific target solution is replaced by the convergence or _ contraction _ between any pairs of solutions @xcite .",
    "essentially , this stronger property means that solutions forget about their initial condition .",
    "popular control applications include tracking and regulation @xcite , observer design @xcite , coordination , and synchronization @xcite , to cite a few .",
    "those incremental stability questions are often reformulated as conventional stability questions for a suitable error system , the zero solution of the error system translating the convergence of two solutions to each other",
    ". this ad - hoc remedy may be successful in specific situations but it faces unpleasant obstacles that include both methodological issues  such as the issue of transforming a time - invariant problem into a time - variant one  and fundamental issues  such as the issue of defining a suitable error between trajectories .",
    "those limitations also apply to the lyapunov characterizations of incremental stability that have appeared in the recent years , primarily in the important work of angeli @xcite .    in a seminal paper @xcite , lohmiller and",
    "slotine advocate a different angle of attack for nonlinear stability analysis .",
    "their paper brings the attention of the control community to the basic fact that the distance measuring the convergence of two trajectories to each other needs not be constructed explicitly .",
    "instead , it can be the integral of an infinitesimal measure of contraction .",
    "in other words , the often intractable construction of a distance needed for a global analysis can be substituted by a local construction . at a fundamental level",
    ", this approach brings differential geometry to the rescue of lyapunov theory . the contraction concept of lohmiller and slotine  sometimes called `` convergence '' in reference to an earlier concept of demidovich @xcite  has been successfully used in a number of applications in the recent years @xcite . yet , its connections to lyapunov theory have been scarse , preventing a vast body of system theoretic tools to be exploited in the framework of contraction theory .",
    "the present paper aims at bridging lyapunov theory and contraction theory by formulating a differential version of the fundamental second s lyapunov theorem .",
    "assuming that the state - space is a differentiable manifold , the classical concept of lyapunov function in the ( manifold ) state - space is lifted to the tangent bundle .",
    "we call this lifted lyapunov function a finsler - lyapunov function because it endows the differentiable manifold with a finsler structure , which is precisely what is needed to associate by integration a global distance ( or lyapunov function ) to the local construction .",
    "we formulate a lyapunov theorem that provides a sufficient pointwise geometric condition to quantify incremental stability , that is , how solutions of differential equations approach each other .",
    "the pointwise properties of the finsler - lyapunov function in the tangent space guarantees that a suitable ( integrated ) distance function decays along solutions , proving incremental stability .",
    "there are a number of reasons that motivate the finsler structure as the appropriate differential structure to study incremental stability .",
    "primarily , it unifies the approach advocated by slotine  which equips the state - space with a riemannian structure  and alternative approaches to contraction , such as the recent approach by russo , di bernardo , and sontag @xcite based on a matrix measure for the local measure of contraction .",
    "examples in the paper further suggest that the finsler framework will allow to unify the application of contraction to physical systems  typically akin to the riemannian framework of classical mechanics  and to conic applications  typically akin to ( non - riemannian ) finsler metrics  such as consensus problems or monotone systems encountered in biology .    a primary motivation to study contraction in a ( differential )",
    "lyapunov framework is to make the whole body of lyapunov theory available to contraction analysis .",
    "this is a vast program , only illustrated in the present paper by the very first extension of lyapunov theorem based on lasalle s invariance principle .",
    "although we are not aware of a published invariance principle for contraction analysis , its formulation in the proposed differential framework is a straightforward extension of its classical formulation and we anticipate this mere extension to be as useful for incremental stability analysis as it is for classical lyapunov stability analysis .",
    "we also include in this paper an extension of the basic theorem to the weaker notion of _ horizontal _ contraction . horizontal contraction is weaker than contraction in that the pointwise decay of the finsler - lyapunov function is verified only in a subspace  called the horizontal subspace  of the tangent space .",
    "disregarding contraction in specific directions is a convenient way to take into account symmetry directions along which no contraction is expected .",
    "this weaker notion of contraction is adapted to many physical systems and to many applications where contraction theory has proven useful , such as tracking , observer design , or synchronization .",
    "those applications involve one or several copies of a given system and only the contraction between the copies and the system trajectories is of interest .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the notation is summarized in section [ sec : notation ] .",
    "sections [ sec : incrementa_stability ] , [ sec : finslyap_functs ] , [ sec : finslyap_thm ] contain the core of the differential framework through the introduction of the main definitions , results , and related examples .",

    ", the construction of a finsler - lyapunov function , a local object , implicitly provides the construction of a decreasing distance between solutions , a global object .",
    "the study of global distances through local metrics is the essence of finsler geometry , a generalization of riemannian geometry .",
    "several examples and applications in the paper suggest that the finsler differentiable structure is indeed the natural framework for contraction analysis , unifying in a natural way earlier contributions restricted either to a riemannian framework @xcite or to matrix measures of contraction @xcite . in the same way , the formulation of the results on differentiable manifolds rather than in euclidean spaces is not for the mere sake of generality but motivated by the fact that global incrementally stability questions arising in applications involve nonlinear spaces as a rule rather than as an exception .    a central motivation to bridge lyapunov theory and contraction analysis is to provide contraction analysis with the whole set of system - theoretic tools derived from lyapunov theory .",
    "the present paper only illustrates this program with lasalle s invariance principle but we expect many further generalizations of lyapunov theory to carry out in the proposed framework .",

    "although a straightforward extension of contraction , the concept of horizontal contraction introduced in this paper illustrates the potential of contraction analysis in areas only partially explored to date .",
    "primarily , it provides the natural differential geometric framework to study contraction in systems with symmetries , disregarding variations in the symmetry directions where no contraction is expected .",
    "problems such as synchronization , coordination , observer design , and tracking all involve a notion of horizontal contraction rather than contraction .",
    "the notion of forward contraction , which corresponds to the particular case of selecting the vector field to span the horizontal distribution , connects the proposed framework to an entirely distinct theory which seeks to characterize asymptotic behaviors by bendixson type of criteria , excluding periodic orbits or forcing convergence to equilibrium sets @xcite .",
