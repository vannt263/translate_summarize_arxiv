    "in recent experiments @xcite on the irradiation of the thin - film metal samples by high power ion beams ( hpib ) thin films of aluminium and silver on the niobium and copper substrates were irradiated by carbon ions .",
    "the considerable penetration depth of the film atoms into the substrate , exceeding the length of the projective path of carbon atoms , has been revealed in the irradiated samples .",
    "the estimation of the effective diffusion coefficients has given the anomalously high magnitudes @xcite @xmath25 sm@xmath26s@xmath27 .",
    "the effect of the intensive mass transfer by hpib irradiation has been registered earlier in work @xcite .",
    "a similar effect has also been observed at electron and laser irradiation of solids @xcite and at shock loading of the samples @xcite .",
    "the complete explanation of this phenomenon within the scope of the known diffusion mechanisms has not yet been found .",
    "+ one of possible causes responsible for the accelerated mass transport is the shock wave , generated by irradiation , which is able to induce the enhanced migration of atoms on large depths @xcite . in investigating this mechanism of diffusion within the scope of the hydrodynamic description",
    "usually one starts from the known diffusion equation in which , according to fick s law , the diffusion flux is defined by gradients of the concentration of a diffusing substance , a pressure and a temperature .",
    "such approach is well justified if the disturbances occurring in a system change slowly enough in comparison with the characteristic rate at which the given system approaches the local equilibrium . meanwhile the interaction of particle beams with a solid induces in the latter rather fast hydrodynamic processes with the characteristic times of order or less than @xmath28s and the shock velocity can reach several kilometers per secund . under these conditions",
    "one should expect a significant deviation of the system state from local equilibrium and the violation of fick s law and take into account an influence of the relaxation of the system on the process of mass transport .",
    "+ in this paper we want to study within a simple model basic features the impurity transfer in the relaxating solid medium .",
    "more specifically the purpose of the work is to research the interstitial diffusion in the field of the fast moving deformation disturbance of the type of the shock wave .",
    "the velocity of the movement of this disturbance is supposed to be compared with the velocity of the propagation of concentration disturbances in the medium .",
    "the latter condition just defines the condition of absence of local equilibrium in the system @xcite .",
    "the task is also interest in connection with shock - compression experiments with metals containing considerable atomic concentrations of interstitial hydrogen @xcite .",
    "+ the description of the fast hydrodynamical processes requires an extended number of independent variables , defining the nonequilibrium state of a medium , in comparison with conventional hydrodynamics . during the course of short enough the characteristic time intervals , in particular , the diffusion flux may not have time to relax to its local - equilibrium value , defined by fick s law and it should be considered as independent variable obeying some relaxation equation . the dissipative fluxes ( diffusion flux , viscous pressure tensor , heat flux ) included in the local conservative laws of mass , momentum and energy are frequently exploited as additional independent variables @xcite .",
    "+ in section  [ sec:2 ] we determine the total set of the independent variables suitable for the description of the fast hydrodynamical processes in the crystalline solid with interstitials . for these variables",
    "the derivation of the set of the coupled hydrodynamical equations , including a relaxation equation for the diffusion flux is given .",
    "section  [ sec:3 ] is devoted to the investigation of the mass transport in the field of fast - moving deformation disturbance of the crystal in the absence of local equilibrium in the system . resume and concluding remarks are given in section  [ sec:4 ]",
    "in this section we want to derive the set of equations relevant for the description of fast hydrodynamical processes in the crystalline solid with interstitial impurities .",
    "the complete set of the hydrodynamical equations has to contain the local conservation laws of mass , momentum and the equation for the entropy production @xmath29 here @xmath21 is the total mass density of the medium ( lattice plus interstitials ) , @xmath13 is the mass velocity , @xmath6 is the entropy density of the medium , @xmath19 is the tensor momentum flux density , @xmath5 is the heat flux density , @xmath2 is the diffusion flux density of interstitials , @xmath17 and @xmath7 are the chemical potential of the interstitials per unit of volume and the absolute temperature , respectively , and @xmath30 is the dissipative function of the medium ; summation over repeated latin indices is implied . +",
    "further we suppose that a concentration of vacancies is negligible or their mobility is significantly less than the mobility of interstitials so that the mass transport occurs mainly by the interstitial motion . introducting the mass concentration of the interstitial particles @xmath0 we write down the continuity equation for the interstitial density @xmath31 as follows @xmath32    it should be noted that the diffusion flux @xmath2 , appearing in equations ( [ 3 ] ) and ( [ 4 ] ) , is determined in a rest frame ( moving with velocity @xmath13 relative to the laboratory frame ) .",
    "meanwhile for a crystal it is convenient to determine the diffusion flux @xmath33 relative to a lattice .",
    "it is easy to see that both fluxes are related by @xmath34 . as the mass concentration @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are masses of an impurity particle and a host atom , then for light impurities ( type of hydrogen ) , occurring into a matrix of heavy atoms , @xmath38 even for the finite atomic concentration . because of this @xmath39 .",
    "+ the variables @xmath40 , ( or @xmath7 ) define conventional set of the independent hydrodynamical variables for a `` fluid - like '' medium . a solid with point defects has the extra independent hydrodynamical variable .",
    "this is a displacement vector @xmath9 defining displacement of lattice sites @xcite .",
    "in addition , according to above said , in the case of fast processes the dissipative fluxes - diffusion flux @xmath2 , heat flux @xmath5 and viscous pressure tensor @xmath41 must be included among the set of independent variables .",
    "for simplicity we shall assume that the relaxation times of fluxes @xmath5 and @xmath41 are considerably less than the relaxation time of diffusion flux and during characteristic time of the process under consideration the fluxes @xmath5 and @xmath41 have time to relax to their local equilibrium values @xcite .",
    "in this case diffusion flux @xmath42 is the only new independent variable .",
    "+ thus we assume that quantities @xmath43 completely define the nonequilibrium state of the system . for such set variables the set of the hydrodynamical equations ( [ 1])-([4 ] ) has to be supplemented by the equations for the displacement vector @xmath9 and the diffusion flux @xmath42 .",
    "to derive these equations and define the still unknown @xmath44 and @xmath45 , appearing in equations ( [ 1])-([4 ] ) , we use the method originally applied in the theory of the superfluids for the derivation of the equations of the two - fluid hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "the main idea , in the given case , is as follows .",
    "we shall find these quantities so that the conservation energy law @xmath46 would follow from equations ( [ 1])-([4 ] ) and the equations for @xmath47 ( an upper dot denotes the time derivative ) . in the equation ( [ 5 ] ) @xmath1 and @xmath48 are the energy density and the energy flux density of the medium , respectively .",
    "+ the energy @xmath1 is related by the gallilean transformation to its value @xmath49 in the frame , where a given element of the volume of the medium rests , by the relationship @xmath50 let us now write down the differential of @xmath49 , considered as a function of @xmath51 and the infinitesimal strain tensor @xmath52 in the form @xmath53 here @xmath16 is the chemical potential of the medium , @xmath54 is the conjugate variables with @xmath55 , and @xmath22 is the symmetric , elastic stress tensor ; here and further the tilde is used to denote the traceless part of a tensor . in the equation ( [ 7 ] ) it has been taken into account that the variation @xmath56 of sum of diagonal components of the strain tensor @xmath52 is determined by the variation of the density @xmath57 . + differentiating the equation ( [ 6 ] ) with respect to time and using equation ( [ 7 ] ) , one obtains @xmath58 employing equations ( [ 1])-([4 ] ) we can write down the time derivatives as @xmath59 inserting the equations ( [ 9])-([13 ] ) into equation([8 ] ) and taking into account that @xmath60 after long , though simple , transformations , one has @xmath61 finally equation ( [ 14 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath62 where the viscous pressure tensor @xmath41 is defined from the equality @xmath63 and the notations have been introduced @xmath64 and for the material derivative @xmath65 .",
    "+ in the derivation equation ( [ 16 ] ) we have neglected the term of the second order of infinitesimal in strains @xmath66 in comparison with the linear term @xmath67 .",
    "+ equation ( [ 16 ] ) defines the momentum flux density , where @xmath3 can be interpreted as `` pressure '' in the medium .",
    "comparing further equation ( [ 15 ] ) with the energy conservation law ( [ 5 ] ) we define the energy flux density @xmath4 and the dissipative function @xmath45 as @xmath68 and @xmath69 since the energy @xmath49 is even under time reversal , the dependence between @xmath49 and @xmath70 in the simplest approximation has the form @xmath71 where @xmath72 is assumed to be constants and dots denote the terms of the highest order of infinitesimal in fluxes . in this case @xmath73 and the dissipative function @xmath45 can be rewritten as @xmath74 where @xmath75 in the framework of the linear theory the positive definiteness of @xmath45 leads to the linear relationships relating the dissipative fluxes to the thermodynamic forces . taking into account onsager s reciprocity relations for the transport coefficients and time - reversal property of dissipative effects @xcite , we can write these relationships in the form @xmath76 where the forth - rank tensor @xmath77 is related to the effect of the viscosity and @xmath78 are tensor transport coefficients",
    ". + let us eliminate the thermodynamic force @xmath79 from equations ( [ 23 ] ) and ( [ 25 ] ) .",
    "redenoting the transport coefficients and introducing the explicit definition of @xmath79 into equation ( [ 24 ] ) one rewrites the set ( [ 23])-([25 ] ) for the case of the cubic lattice as @xmath80 where @xmath81 are the scalar transport coefficients .",
    "@xmath82 is connected with the heat conductivity , @xmath23 is the relaxation time of the diffusion flux .",
    "the coefficients @xmath83 determine the relation between the dissipative effects and shear stresses .",
    "the remaining coefficients are due to the processes of diffusion , thermal diffusion and barodiffusion ( owing to the pressure dependence of the interstitial chemical potential @xmath17 in equation ( [ 28 ] ) ) . +",
    "thus the complete set of the hydrodynamic equations of the system under consideration contains now equations ( [ 1])- ( [ 4 ] ) and equations ( [ 27 ] ) , ( [ 28 ] ) , where the fluxes @xmath84 and the dissipative function @xmath45 are given by equations ( [ 22 ] ) , ( [ 26 ] ) and ( [ 21 ] ) .",
    "as it seen from ( [ 28 ] ) the equation for diffusion flux is the equation of a relaxation type . at @xmath85 ,",
    "i.e. for slow processes , it determines directly the diffusion flux in terms of gradients of the basic hydrodynamic variables .",
    "in this section we consider the diffusion of interstitial impurities in the field of the fast - moving deformation disturbance of the type of a chock wave .",
    "we assume that the stepped disturbance ( kink ) , for which the displacement field ( along the @xmath86-axis ) has the form @xcite @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the amplitude of the disturbance and @xmath15 is the width of the transition region , propagates along the @xmath86-direction with the constant velocity @xmath11 compared with the velocity of the propagation of concentration disturbances in the medium .",
    "+ at the given motion of the lattice ( [ 29 ] ) the diffusion process is largely governed by the set of two equations : the local conservation law of mass ( [ 4 ] ) and the relaxation equation for the diffusion flux ( [ 28 ] ) .",
    "let us now transform the right side of equation ( [ 28 ] ) to the alternative form .",
    "combining equations ( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ 17 ] ) and taking into account equation ( [ 20 ] ) , one obtains @xmath89 where @xmath90 .",
    "it follows from equation ( [ 30 ] ) that one can consider the chemical potential @xmath17 to be a function of the independent variables @xmath91 .",
    "omitting essentially nonlinear terms , note that in the case of the cubic symmetry a scalar function can depend on the tensor @xmath92 by convolution @xmath93 only .",
    "consequently one can consider @xmath17 to be a function of @xmath94 only .",
    "+ the available experimental data indicate that when a shock wave propagates in a a solid the effect of thermodiffusion is neglected in comparison with borodiffusion @xcite . here",
    "we also assume that the main factor determining mass transfer in our system is the effect of barodiffusion . then omitting the gradient of a temperature one rewrites equation ( [ 28 ] ) in the more simple form as @xmath95 it follows from equation ( [ 16 ] ) that @xmath96 , with @xmath97 is the elastic stress tensor . in the one - dimensional case one",
    "neglects the influence of shear stress on a diffusion mobility .",
    "in addition , we assume that hook s law @xmath98 , relating the pressure @xmath3 with the deformation @xmath99 of a material element , is valid . redenoting the constants in equation ( [ 31 ] ) one writes down in the linear approximation the coupled set of the one - dimensional versions of equations ( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 31 ] ) as @xmath100 where @xmath101 has the meaning of the coefficient of the barodiffusion and @xmath102 is the diffusion constant .",
    "in addition , in obtaining of equation ( [ 32 ] ) and ( [ 33 ] ) we have neglected the term @xmath103 , appearing in the material derivative that is small for fast processes in comparison with the time derivative @xmath104 . + after some algebra , equations ( [ 32 ] ) and ( [ 33 ] ) are brought to the form @xmath105 at @xmath106 equation ( [ 34 ] ) ( as well as equation([35 ] ) ) is known as the telegrapher equation that , unlike to the classical diffusion equation , gives rise to the finite speed @xmath107 of the propagation of concentration perturbations @xcite .",

    "+ the transition to the local - equilibrium theory occurs if in equation ( [ 33 ] ) one puts formally @xmath85 . using the same dimensionless variables as in equations ( [ 36 ] ) and ( [ 37 ] )",

    "this figures also show the difference between the local equilibrium and the local nonequilibrium ( presence of the relaxation process in the medium ) theories . in all cases",
    "the deformation disturbance produces the enhanced impurity concentration immediately before the front of the deformation wave ( the region of @xmath138 ) , lowering it behind the front . in the region of the of the enhanced concentration the diffusion flux points in the direction of the disturbance propagation , while in the region of lowered concentration - in the opposite direction . + as figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] show , at @xmath139 the concentration perturbations are significantly greatly in the local nonequilibrium medium . in this case",
    "the diffusion flux is nearly twice as large as that for the local equilibrium system .",
    "+ 2._the narrow transition region _ , @xmath140 . in what follows",
    "we consider the special case of @xmath141 .",
    "figures [ fig4]-[fig5 ] demonstrate a pronounced difference between two approaches .",
    "the ejection of the major number of interstitials into the region before the front of the wave is observed in the absence of a local equilibrium in the medium . in the latter case",
    "the impurity concentration in the indicated region is nearly by an order greater than the local equilibrium concentration that does not change practically with the rising of @xmath136 .",
    "figures [ fig4]-[fig5 ] also show the considerable deviation for diffusion fluxes demonstrating the acceleration of the mass transfer under local nonequilibrium conditions .",
    "note that at @xmath142 in the region of the front the diffusion fluxes referring to the different nonequilibrium states of the medium point in complete opposite directions .",
    "the difference between the local nonequilibrium curves at different magnitudes @xmath136 are shown in figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "+ the reason of the enhanced impurity concentration before the front in the local - nonequilibrium system is that when the velocity of the deformation wave is near to @xmath12 , the concentration disturbances have no time to propagate on large distances from the front .",
    "this has the effect of accumulation of interstitials in the indicated region . here",
    "is a complete analogy with the task about the motion of a thermal source in a relaxating medium @xcite .",
    "+ it should be noted that in the case of the local tension ( @xmath143 ) the concentration peaks will form behind the front of the wave ( @xmath144 ) by the moving particles from the region @xmath145 .",
    "in this work we have presented the investigation of mass transfer in the field of the fast - moving deformation disturbance of the type of a shock wave , propagating in the infinite lattice with interstitial impurities .",

    "the only extra variable is the diffusion flux , the relaxation time of which is assumed to be comparable to the timescale of the process under consideration . for the selected variables the set of the coupled hydrodynamical equations has been derived .",
    "+ having assumed that the main factor impacting on mass transfer in our case is the effect of barodiffusion @xcite , we reduce the diffusion task to the investigation of the set of two linear , one - dimensional equations .",
    "these are the equation for the interstitial concentration ( [ 36 ] ) and the relaxation equation for the diffusion flux ( [ 37 ] ) .",
    "the solution of this set is defined by two dimensionless parameters @xmath24 and @xmath146 . at the different magnitudes",
    "@xmath147 we have considered two special cases @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "+ figures [ fig1]-[fig5 ] show that the occurrence of the relaxation process in the medium leads to the significant deviation of the concentration profiles and the diffusion fluxes from the local equilibrium diffusion data .",
    "the ejection of interstitials into the region before the front enables to speak about the effect of the entrainment of impurity particles by the wave .",
    "this effect takes place in the local equilibrium system also ( see @xcite as well ) , however at @xmath149 to a largest measure it is displayed in the local nonequilibrium conditions ( figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "+ in the case of the local tension ( @xmath143 ; the mirror reflection of the plots [ fig1]-[fig6 ] relative to axis @xmath150 ) the concentration peaks will form beyond the front of the wave by a `` suction '' of particles from the range before the front into the extended range . + the case of @xmath151 ( @xmath152 ) corresponds to the smooth enough behavior of the deformation disturbance . here",
    ", in the region of the front , the local nonequilibrium diffusion flux is nearly twice as large as that for the local equilibrium system .",
    "the case of @xmath149 ( @xmath153 ) corresponds to the sharp deformation variations . from figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ]",
    "it is seen that in this case one can speak about the significant acceleration of the mass transfer in the local nonequilibrium system .",

    "thus our investigation has shown that at the taken magnitudes of the parameters of the model an enhanced mass transfer takes place in local nonequilibrium system in comparison with the same process considered under the local equilibrium conditions . + note in conclusion",
    "that the results presented here have been obtained within the scope of the linear theory .",
