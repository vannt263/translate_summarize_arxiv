    "recent data from sne ia have provided strong evidence for an expanding universe speeding up , rather than slowing down ( riess et al . 1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1998 ) .",
    "these observational evidences have stimulated great interest in a more general class of cosmological models driven by nonrelativistic matter and a  quintessence \" component , i.e. , an exotic fluid with an arbitrary equation of state @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , which probably dominates the bulk of matter in the observed universe .",
    "examples of these models include the evolving scalar field ( ratra & peebles 1988 ; frieman et al .",
    "1998 ; caldwell et al . 1998 ) , the smooth noninteracting component ( xcdm ) ( turner & white 1997 ; chiba et al .",
    "1997 ) , and still the frustated network of topological defects in which @xmath4 , being @xmath5 the dimension of the defect ( spergel & pen 1997 ) .",
    "some observational aspects of these models have extensively been analyzed in the literature .",
    "for example , waga & miceli ( 1999 ) , combining statistics of gravitational lenses and sne ia data have found @xmath6 ( @xmath7 cl ) for a spatially flat universe .",
    "efstathiou ( 1999 ) , by using high - z type ia supernovae and cosmic microwave background anisotropies , has found @xmath8 ( 2@xmath9 ) if the universe is assumed to be spatially flat , or @xmath10 ( 2@xmath9 ) for universes of arbitrary spatial curvature .",
    "perlmutter et al . ( 1999 ) constrained @xmath8 ( @xmath11 cl ) using large - scale structure and sne ia in a spatially flat geometry .",
    "however , although carefully investigated in many of their theoretical and observational aspects , the influence of a  quintessence \" component in some kinematic tests like the angular size - redshft relation still remains to be analyzed . in principle",
    ", the lensing effect of the expanding universe may provide strong limits on the free parameter describing this exotic component .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to explore how uncertaints in distance measures of extragalactic objects and their underlying evolutionary effects may alter the standard cold dark matter results .",
    "on the other hand , the existing angular size data for distant objects are until nowadays somewhat controversial , specially because they envolve at least two kinds of observational dificulties .",
    "first , any high redshift object may have a wide range of proper sizes , and , second , evolutionary and selection effects probably are not negligible .",
    "indeed , the @xmath12 relation for some extended sources samples seems to be quite imcompatible with the predictions of the standard frw model when the latter effects are not taken into account ( kapahi 1987;1989 ) .",
    "there have also been some claims that the best fit model for the observed distribution of high redshifts extended objects is provided by the standard einstein - de sitter universe ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) with no significant evolution ( buchalter et al . 1998 )",
    ". however , all these results are in contradiction with the recent observations from type ia supernovae .",
    "indeed , such data seem to ruled out world models filled only by baryonic matter , and more generally , any model with positive deceleration parameter .",
    "the same happens with the corresponding bounds using the ages of old high redshift galaxies ( dunlop et al .",
    "1996 ; krauss 1997 ; alcaniz & lima 1999 ) .",
    "the case for compact radio sources is also of great interest .",
    "these objects seem to be less sensitive to evolutionary effects since they are short - lived ( @xmath15 ) and much smaller than their host galaxy .",
    "initially , the data from a sample of 82 objects gave remarkable suport for the einstein - de sitter universe ( kellerman 1993 ) .",
    "however , some analysis suggest that , although compatible with an einstein - de sitter universe , the kellerman data can not rule out a significant part of the @xmath16 plane ( kayser 1995 ) .",
    "some authors have also argued that models where @xmath12 diminishes and after a given @xmath17 remains constant may also provide a good fit to kellerman s data . in particular , by analysing a subset of 59 compact sources within the same sample , dabrowski et al .",
    "( 1995 ) found that no useful bounds on the value of the deceleration parameter @xmath18 can be derived .",
    "indeed , even considering that euclidean angular sizes ( @xmath19 ) are excluded at 99@xmath20 confidence level , and that the data are consistent with @xmath21 , they apparently do not rule out higher values of the deceleration parameter ( stephanas & saha 1995 ) .",
    "more recently , based in a more complete sample of data , which include the ones originally obtained by kellermann , it was argued that the @xmath12 relation may be consistent with any model of the frw class with deceleration parameter @xmath22 ( gurvits et al .",
    "1999 ) .    in this context",
    ", we discuss the influence of a  quintessence \" component ( q - model ) on the angular size - redshift relation .",
    "particular emphasis is given for the critical redshift at which the angular size of an extragalactic source takes its minimal value . in the limiting case ( @xmath23 )",
    ", the results previously derived by krauss & schramm ( 1993 ) for a flat universe with cosmological constant ( @xmath24cdm ) are recovered . for comparison",
    ", we also consider the case of an open model dominated by nonrelativistic matter ( om ) .",
    "let us now consider the frw line element @xmath25 @xmath26    \\quad   , \\ ] ] where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are dimensionless comoving coordinates , @xmath30 is the scale factor , and @xmath31 depends on the curvature parameter ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) .",
    "the later function is defined by one of the following forms : @xmath34 , @xmath27 , @xmath35 , respectively , for open , flat and closed universes .    in this background , the angular size - redshift relation for a rod of intrinsic length @xmath36",
    "is easily obtained by integrating the spatial part of the above expression for @xmath27 and @xmath29 fixed .",
    "one finds @xmath37 the dimensionless coordinate @xmath27 is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a convenient integration variable .",
    "for flat q - models , the dimensionless function @xmath40 takes the following form    @xmath41^{{1}\\over{2 } }   \\quad   , \\ ] ]    where @xmath42 is the present day density parameter associated with the  quintessence \" component .",
    "observe that the flat constraint condition , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 has been explicitly used in the derivation of ( 4 ) .",
    "before proceed further , it is interesting to make explicit the connection with some special cases already established in the literature .",
    "if @xmath45 , or still if @xmath46 and @xmath47 , one obtains from ( 2)-(4 ) the angular diameter expression of the einstein - de sitter universe ( sandage 1988 ) @xmath48 } \\quad.\\ ] ] if @xmath49 , the q - model reduces to a @xmath24cdm universe , the details of which has been analysed by krauss & schramm ( 1993 ) .",
    "in particular , if the pair @xmath50 , the angular diameter of this q - model is the same of a flat universe with a pure cosmological constant , namely @xmath51 we recall that expression ( 5 ) yields a well - known result that the angular diameter in einstein - de sitter model has a minimum at @xmath52 ( hoyle 1959 ) , whereas ( 6 ) shows us that the extreme q - model , ( @xmath53)=(@xmath54 ) , has no minimum at all ( @xmath55 ) . indeed , for any expanding frw type cosmology , the typical behavior of the angular size relation is the existence of a critical redshift greater than the above einstein - de sitter value .",
    "we also observe that a new analytical result is obtained by taking @xmath56 for arbitraries values of @xmath57 . from ( 2)-(4 ) one finds    @xmath58   \\ } ^{-1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath59 .    the expression ( 2 ) for @xmath12",
    "can not be written in simple analytical form , unless the pair of parameters ( @xmath57 , @xmath60 ) take the above mentioned values .",
    "for generic cases , the results can be obtained only by numerical treatment .    0.1 in    in fig .  1 we show a log - log plot of angular size versus redshift for flat q - models with @xmath61 and some selected values of @xmath60 .",
    "for comparison we have also considered the standard om cosmology ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "as can be seen there , for all values of @xmath60 , the angular size initially decreases with increasing @xmath17 , reaches its minimum value at a given @xmath0 , and eventually begins to increase for fainter magnituds .",
    "note also that the standard om behavior may be interpreted as an intermediary case between @xmath24cdm ( @xmath49 ) and a q - model with @xmath63 , though its critical redshift is displaced to higher values .",
    "as widely known , the existence of a critical redshift @xmath1 on the angular size - redshift relation may qualitatively be understood in terms of an expanding space .",
    "the light observed today from a source at high @xmath17 was emitted when the object was closer .",
    "the relevant aspect here is how this effect may be quantified in terms of the @xmath60 parameter . to analyze the sensivity of the critical redshift to  quintessence \" , we addopt here an approach different of the one applied by krauss & schramm ( 1993 ) to the case of a flat @xmath24cdm universe .",
    "where @xmath66 , a prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath17 and by definition @xmath67 .",
    "observe also that ( 3 ) can readily be differentiated yielding @xmath68 where @xmath69^{{1\\over 2 } } \\quad .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      the meaning of the above equation is self evident .",
    "it represents an implicit integro - algebraic equation for the critical redshift @xmath1 as a function of the parameters defining the flat q - models . in general",
    ", this expression can not be solved in closed analytical form for @xmath1 . however , by taking the limit @xmath45 in ( 11 ) , the value @xmath71 is readily obtained as should be expected .",
    "the interesting point here is that ( 11 ) is quite convenient for a numerical treatment .",
    "a similar equation can also be derived for an open cold dark matter universe ( om ) .",
    "we find @xmath72 = f_{om}(\\omega_{m } , z_m ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath73 and the functions @xmath74 , @xmath75 are given by @xmath76^{{1 \\over 2}}\\ ] ] @xmath77^{{1 \\over 2 } } .\\ ] ]    in fig .",
    "2 we show the diagrams of @xmath1 as a function of the density parameter @xmath57 , and some selected values of @xmath60 ( at this point the reader should compare our results with the alternative numerical method developed by krauss & schramm ( 1993 ) for a @xmath24cdm universe ) . note that equation ( 12 ) has also been used to plot the case for the open universes ( solid line ) . in the former case ,",
    "the curves show us clearly that all the q - models belongs to the same class , which contains the case of a pure cosmological constant .",
    "the smallest value of the critical redshift is exactly the one given by einstein - de sitter universe ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "this value is pushed to the right direction , that is , for any value of @xmath60 it is displaced to higher redshifts as the @xmath57 parameter increases .",
    "for instance , consider that @xmath79 . by taking @xmath80 and @xmath81",
    ", we find @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively . in the opposite extreme ( @xmath84 )",
    "the critical redshift is finite unless the parameter of the equation of state take the extreme value for a pure @xmath24 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "note also that for a given value of @xmath85 , the minimum is also displaced for higher redshifts when the @xmath86 parameter diminishes .",
    "however , we see that the effect is small if the density parameter @xmath57 is low , say , smaller than 0.2 , since the curves are nearly flat and practically coincid below this limit .",
    "this coincidence is even more surprizing for @xmath87 .",
    "note that open models driven by cold dark matter ( om ) affects strongly the angular size , however , in a somewhat different manner as compared to what happens in a generic q - model ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "in particular , if the density parameters are small , say , @xmath88 , @xmath57 , smaller than 1/3 , the critical redshift is much bigger in the former than in the later .",
    "this is easy to understand physically , because at this limit the contibution of the quintessence is small , leading to results close to the flat einstein - de sitter universe .    for a large class of q - models considered in this letter ,",
    "the critical redshifts @xmath1 are displayed in table 1 .",
    "the om results have also been quoted for comparison .",
    "the third column with @xmath49 corresponds to a flat @xmath24cdm model ( see krauss & schramm 1993 ) . from these results",
    "one arrives to a inevitable conclusion : even neglecting evolution , the redshift at which the angular size is minimal can not alone discriminate between world models since different scenarios may provide the same @xmath1 values .",
    "in particular , for the observationally favoured open universe ( @xmath89 ) we find @xmath90 , a value that may also be obtained for q - models having @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "however , if the angular diameter results are combinated with other tests , some interesting cosmological constraints may be obtained .",
    "for instance , at galactic scales , the observed cobe normalized pattern of density fluctuations is more difficult to fit within a low - density open universe than in q - models ( caldwell et al .",
    "another real possibility is that the universe is actually in an accelerated expansion state ( @xmath93 ) , as indicated recently by measurements using type ia supernovae ( riess et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1998 ) . in this case , any model of the standard frw class is ruled out regardless of its curvature parameter . however , the bidimensional parameter space ( @xmath94 ) is still large enough to accomodate q - models predicting both an acelerated expansion ( if @xmath95 ) , and high values of the critical redshift , say , close to the values of @xmath1 given by the open models .",

    "1998 ) . in this case , eq.(11 ) is still valid but the function @xmath99 must be divided by a factor @xmath100 .",
    "the displacement of @xmath0 relative to the case with no evolution ( @xmath101 ) due to the effects above mentioned may be unexpectedly large .",
    "for example , if one takes @xmath102 as found by buchalter et al .",
    "1998 , the redshift of the minimum angular size for the einstein - de sitter case ( @xmath103 ) moves from @xmath104 to @xmath105 . in this way ,",

    "this result may be a possible explanation why the data of gurvits et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , although apparently in agreement with the einstein - de sitter universe , do not show clear evidence for a minimal angular size close to @xmath106 , as should be expected for this model .",
    "this sort of effect is even greater when an additional  quintessence \" component is also considered . in the same vein , since evolution is not forbidden from any principle , we stress that constraints from angular size redshift relation should be taken with some caution .    *",
