    "a non - trivial value reveals that the charge one @xmath1 caloron actually contains @xmath2 constituent bps monopoles , whose masses are determined by the eigenvalues of the polyakov loop ( 2i(_1,_2,,_n)),_i=1^n_i=0 .",
    "for defining the constituent masses it is important to note that one can choose a gauge in which @xmath6 ( for a proof see  @xcite ) .",
    "this guarantees that the masses @xmath7 , with @xmath8 , add up to @xmath9 such that the action equals that of a charge one instanton .",

    "the polyakov loop generically will have two of its eigenvalues degenerate . for @xmath4",
    "this implies that the polyakov loop becomes @xmath10 , as was verified explicitly  @xcite . in sect",
    "4 we present for @xmath3 the simple result for the polyakov loop at the three constituent locations .",
    "we also review the fact that in a suitable gauge only one of the constituents gauge fields is non - static , in accordance to the taubes - winding  @xcite required to form out of monopoles a four dimensional gauge field configuration with non - trivial topological charge , as is discussed in some detail .",
    "we conclude in sect .",
    "5 with some comments concerning the fact that perhaps monopoles are more fundamental building blocks , since we know how to make instantons out of them .",
    "but we hasten to say the opposite point of view can be taken as well , since monopoles can be made out of an array of instantons .",
    "it more seems to imply they occur on equal footing , in accordance with the `` democratic '' vacuum model described in ref .",
    "using the classical scale invariance we can always arrange @xmath11 , as will be assumed throughout .",

    "note that the index @xmath17 should be considered mod @xmath2 , such that e.g. @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( but note @xmath20 ) .",
    "it is sufficient that only one constituent location is far separated from the others , to show that one can neglect the @xmath21 term in @xmath22 , giving rise to a static action density in this limit  @xcite .",
    "these generalised caloron solutions can be found  @xcite using the nahm transformation  @xcite and the atiyah - drinfeld - hitchin - manin ( adhm ) construction  @xcite , related by a suitably defined fourier transformation .",
    "other methods , relying more exclusively on the nahm transformation , were developed as well  @xcite .",

    "in this limit @xmath39 for @xmath4 , and more generally f_x(z , z)=. we illustrate the localisation of the fermion zero - modes for a typical @xmath3 caloron in figure 1 .",
    "to construct the gauge potential @xmath40 , it is instructive to summarise the adhm formalism for @xmath1 charge @xmath41 instantons  @xcite . it employs a @xmath41 dimensional vector @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is a two - component spinor in the @xmath44 representation of @xmath1 .",

    "@xmath60 denotes the quaternion @xmath61 .",
    "the gauge field is now given by @xmath62 .",

    "the phases of @xmath74 are related to global gauge transformations that leave @xmath68 invariant , and define the `` framing '' of the caloron .",
    "we note that @xmath75 is the fourier transform of the infinite dimensional matrix @xmath63 as it occurs in the adhm construction .",
    "it can be shown  @xcite that @xmath76 . with the help of eq .",
    "( 6 ) we find @xmath77 , see eq .",
    "we also perform fourier transformation to obtain ( z)=_p e^-2piz_p,^m(z)=(z-_m)^m .",

    "note that @xmath79 and that @xmath80 implies a constraint on @xmath71 .",
    "in particular for @xmath4 one finds @xmath81 , and together with @xmath82 , @xmath64 is found to be a multiple of the identity , such that @xmath83 .",
    "the computation of @xmath84 further simplifies when rotating @xmath85 , which can be obtained from @xmath86 and @xmath87 . with @xmath88 and @xmath89",
    "this gives the result of ref .",
    "@xcite a_=|^3__3_+ ( ( |^1_-i|^2 _ ) ( _ 1+i_2 ) _ ) .",
    "also for @xmath3 , @xmath90 can be determined from the explicit result in eq .",
    "( 6 ) ( since two intervals on the circle , partitioned in three parts , always are neighbours ) . choosing the three constituents to lie in the @xmath60-@xmath91-plane we can take @xmath92 .",
    "it is then a simple matter to compute the gauge field explicitly , albeit in a complicated form , due to the need to diagonalise @xmath64 .",
    "in the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite the following exact result was found for the @xmath4 polyakov loop along the line ( taken along the @xmath93-axes ) connecting the two constituents , p(0,0,z)=-(_1+_zacosh[(_2_1 ) ] ) . from this",
    "it is easily seen that @xmath94 takes on each of the values @xmath10 only once , with @xmath95 and @xmath96 for well separated constituents .",
    "these are the equivalent to the conditions for the higgs field to vanishing , an alternative way to specify the location of the constituents . when the constituents get nearer to each other , these `` zeros '' shift outwards ( whereas the maxima of the energy density shift inwards ) , see figure 2 .",
    "note that the result for the polyakov loop associated to the constituent at @xmath97 is consistent with @xmath98 , but for the constituent associated to @xmath99 this only holds after applying a gauge transformation that is _ anti - periodic _ in the time direction ( since such a gauge transformation changes the sign of the polyakov loop ) .",
    "this gauge transformation has an interesting relation to the so - called taubes - winding  @xcite , which is most easily understood by looking at the explicit expression for the gauge field . in the _ periodic gauge _",
    "one finds  @xcite a_^per(x)&=&|^3__3_+i_1_3_,0 + & + & ( ( |^1_-i|^2 _ ) ( _ 1+i_2)(_+2i_1_,0 ) ) , where @xmath100 has the following expansion e^-2it_1= \\{r_2e^-2r_2_2e^-2it+r_1 e^-2r_1_1 } , up to relative errors @xmath101 . for large @xmath102 ,",
    "@xmath64 becomes time independent , confirming the static nature of the configuration for large constituent separations .",
    "the time dependence of the constituent at @xmath99 is a full ( gauge ) rotation - the _ taubes - winding _ - responsible for the topological charge of the otherwise time independent monopole pair  @xcite , see figure 3 .",
    "this gauge rotation is achieved by the anti - periodic gauge transformation @xmath103 , since @xmath104 .",
    "also note that for the spherically symmetric bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfield ( bps ) monopole  @xcite a gauge rotation is equivalent to an ordinary rotation .",
    "the information that the constituent at @xmath97 is associated to a static bps monopole , whereas the constituent at @xmath99 has acquired a taubes - winding can be extracted in a way  @xcite that is also valid for @xmath1 .",
    "let us first observe that taking one interval @xmath25 $ ] in isolation , applying the nahm transformation  @xcite gives a single _ static _ bps monopole located at @xmath14 with mass proportional to the length ( @xmath105 ) of the interval .",
    "taking @xmath106 creates an infinite barrier for the interval @xmath107 $ ] and this leaves the interval @xmath108 $ ] , allowing for the interpretation of an @xmath1 monopole with @xmath109 specifying the eigenvalues of the higgs field at infinity , for which it is crucial the @xmath109 add to zero .",
    "indeed , in the periodic gauge @xmath110 tends to a constant at spatial infinity .",
    "this _ static _ monopole solution is composed out of @xmath111 basic bps monopoles of mass @xmath105 , located at @xmath14 , for @xmath112 .",
    "we conclude that with our choice of parameters , always the field associated with the constituent at @xmath113 has to have a time - dependence to give rise to the topological charge of the caloron , and we conclude it is this one that carries the taubes - winding .",
    "note that our argument also demonstrates that for @xmath114 with @xmath115 , one is left with a gauge field that can not be time independent , even though the resulting action density is static  @xcite .",
    "the question now arises , what is the equivalent of the zeros of the higgs field for @xmath1 . to answer this question",
    "we remember that the constituents are _ basic _ bps monopoles , which are obtained by embedding @xmath4 in @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath4 subgroup relevant for this embedding is exactly determined by the unbroken @xmath4 at the core of the constituent .",
    "the restoration of the @xmath4 symmetry arises due to the degeneracy of two of the eigenvalues of the higgs field , or of @xmath94 in our case ( for @xmath116 this indeed implies a vanishing higgs field , which has zero trace , or in our case it implies @xmath117 as its determinant is unity ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath118 the position associated to the the @xmath17-th constituent where two eigenvalues of the polyakov loop coincide . arranging by a global gauge rotation that @xmath119 ( see eq .",
    "( 2 ) ) , we established numerically for @xmath3 that with _ any _ choice of holonomy and constituent locations p_1=p(z_1)=(e^-i_3 ,",
    "e^-i_3,e^2i_3 ) , + p_2=p(z_2)=(e^2i_1 , e^-i_1,e^-i_1 ) , + p_3=p(z_3)=(-e^-i_2,e^2i_2 , -e^-i_2).for the caloron presented in figure 1 we find @xmath120 , and for well separated constituents @xmath121 .",
    "the salient features are that @xmath122 is determined by @xmath123 _ not _ associated to the interval @xmath124 $ ] ( on which @xmath125 takes the value @xmath126 , see eq .",
    "( 4 ) ) . furthermore",
    ", the extra minus signs occurring in @xmath127 reflect the taubes - winding , read - off from the gauge field in the core of the constituent",
    ". it will not be difficult to _ conjecture _ the values of @xmath122 for general @xmath1 : @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 .",
    "note that @xmath132 can also be written as @xmath133 .",
    "as we have seen , an instanton has bps monopoles as constituents , and the explicit results in eq .  ( 19 ) also easily reveal the abelian limit . as long as ) , can be reinterpreted as a bound state of a massive and a massless constituent bps monopole .",
    "massless monopole constituents , giving rise to so - called non - abelian clouds , may play an important role in electric - magnetic duality as the dual of gluons  @xcite .",
    "these massless constituents are delocalised and have no obvious abelian limit . ]",
    "all @xmath134 , the field outside the core of both monopoles is indeed that of two `` bps '' dirac monopoles ( i.e. dyons ) . for @xmath4 outside the cores ,",
    "i.e. assuming @xmath135 for all @xmath17 , one has @xmath136 and ( x)=. we note that when _ neglecting _ the exponential corrections , @xmath137 vanishes on the line connecting the two constituents , and @xmath138 is harmonic outside of this line .",
    "the singularity represents the return flux of the dirac monopole pair , described in the abelian limit by a term proportional to @xmath139 in the magnetic field e_k=_3_k_3,b_k=_3(_k_3 -_k3_j^2 ) . in the full theory",
    "the return flux is absent ( indeed @xmath137 has only an isolated zero at @xmath140 , corresponding to a gauge singularity  @xcite ) .    as was already emphasised in ref .",
    "@xcite , to understand how in the abelian limit the topological charge can be recovered , one needs to preserve the taubes - winding .",
    "this information is described by the framing of the core due to the charged components of the monopole field .",
    "interestingly this describes a hopf fibration  @xcite , see figure 4 .",
    "recently the role of the taubes - winding and hopf fibration for retrieving topological charge was confirmed in great detail within the context of the abelian projection  @xcite .",
    "we have also seen that the fermion zero - mode is localised on the constituent with the taubes - winding and this makes it likely to conjecture that this holds for general monopole loops that support non - trivial taubes - winding , which may be relevant to understanding chiral symmetry breaking in the context of monopole degrees of freedom .",
    "the question which field configurations are more important , is however a bit like the chicken and the egg problem .",
    "after all , we can now make instantons out of monopoles _ and _ monopoles out of instantons .",
    "monopoles are typically used for describing the confining large distance behaviour .",
    "recently it has , however , been pointed out there can be a hidden large size instanton component hitherto undetected  @xcite .",
    "much remains to be done here , but the calorons have provided us interesting new avenues to follow .",
    "let us end by mentioning that the calorons with non - trivial holonomy have also been found on a finite lattice .",
    "for @xmath4 with twisted - boundary conditions remarkably it was found that when the twist is in the time direction , the constituent locations are free , but both constituents have equal mass , see figure 5 .",
    "whereas , when the twist is in the space direction , the constituent locations are maximally separated in the direction of the magnetic flux , but the mass ratios can be arbitrary  @xcite . this has been understood in the general context of the nahm transformation for the torus , relating finite volume calorons to finite volume instantons  @xcite . the suggestion of ref .",
    "@xcite to find these calorons on the lattice by freezing the links on the boundary of the lattice to enforce the proper holonomy has also been realised recently  @xcite .",
    "i am grateful to the organisers , and in particular to valya mitrjushkin , for their invitation and for the wonderful atmosphere in dubna .",
    "i thank all my collaborators of the work presented here , for having contributed to the acquired insights .",
