    "electron impact excitation of nitrogen molecules plays an important role in atmospheric emission of planets and satellites such as the earth , titan and triton . for example , excitation of the @xmath9 state and subsequent transitions to the ground @xmath10 state are responsible for the far ultraviolet emissions of the lyman - birge - hopfield system which is prominent in the airglow of the earth s atmosphere@xcite .",
    "recently , khakoo et al.@xcite measured differential cross sections ( dcss ) of electron impact excitation of n@xmath0 molecule from the ground @xmath11 state to the 8 lowest excited electronic states of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 states . based on their differential cross section data ,",
    "johnson et al.@xcite derived integral cross sections ( icss ) for these electron impact excitations .",
    "in general , their icss are smaller than the other experimental cross sections at low impact energies below 30 ev .",
    "these deviations may have some significance on study of atmospheric emissions , because a mean kinetic energy of electron at high altitudes is about 10 ev@xcite . to shed light on this situation from a theoretical point of view , we perform the ab initio r - matrix calculations of electron impact excitations of n@xmath0 molecule in this work .",
    "many previous experimental measurements have been focused on excitation to a specific electronic state .",
    "for example , ajello and shemansky@xcite and mason and newell@xcite measured icss for electron impact excitation to the @xmath12 state , whereas poparic et al.@xcite , zubek@xcite and zubek and king@xcite measured cross sections for the @xmath13 state .",
    "in addition to these works , zetner and trajmar @xcite reported excitation cross sections to the @xmath14 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath6 states .",
    "so far , comprehensive measurements of the excitation to the 8 lowest electronic states are limited to three groups of cartwright et al .",
    "@xcite , brunger and teubner @xcite and khakoo et al.@xcite .",
    "the measurements of brunger and teubner @xcite include excitation dcss for the @xmath15 and @xmath16 states in addition to the 8 lowest excited states .",
    "the dcss of brunger and teubner@xcite and khakoo et al.@xcite were later converted to icss by campbell et al.@xcite and johnson et al.@xcite , respectively .",
    "detailed reviews on electron n@xmath0 collisions can be found in itikawa@xcite and brunger and buckman@xcite .",
    "several groups have performed theoretical calculation of low energy electron collisions with n@xmath0 molecule .",
    "for example , chung and lin@xcite employed the born approximation to calculate excitation cross sections for the 11 target states including the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 states .",
    "later , the same group of holley et al.@xcite calculated excitation icss for the @xmath6 state using a two - state - close - coupling method .",
    "fliflet et al.@xcite and mu - tao and mckoy@xcite reported distorted - wave cross sections for excitation of the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 states .",
    "in general , these approximate methods are expected to be accurate at high impact energies above 30 ev .",
    "however , more elaborate method is required for precise comparison with experiment at low energies .",
    "gillan et al.@xcite calculated excitation icss for the @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 states using the fixed nuclei r - matrix method .",
    "they included the 4 lowest target states in their r - matrix model , with target ci wave functions containing 2 - 13 csfs .",
    "their cross sections for the @xmath1 and @xmath3 states agree well with the experimental results of cartwright et al .",
    ". however , icss for the @xmath2 state deviate considerably from the experimental cross sections .",
    "subsequently , they extended their r - matrix model to include the 8 lowest valence states@xcite .",
    "their target ci wave functions were much improved from their previous work by employing valence active space description , resulting in 68 - 120 csfs per target state . in their paper , the icss were shown for the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 states , while the dcss were presented for only the @xmath1 state .",
    "agreement with the icss of cartwright et al.@xcite is good for these 4 excited states .",
    "however , agreement is marginal at dcs level .    in this work",
    ", we study electron impact excitation of n@xmath0 molecule by the fixed nuclei r - matrix method as in our previous work on electron o@xmath0 scatterings @xcite .",
    "although theoretical treatment is similar to the previous work of gillan et al.@xcite , more target states and partial waves of a scattering electron are included in the present work .",
    "main purpose of this work is comparison of icss as well as dcss for the 8 lowest excited states with the experimental results of cartwright et al .",
    "@xcite , brunger and teubner@xcite , campbell et al.@xcite , khakoo et al .",
    "@xcite and johnson et al.@xcite .",
    "this is because previous theoretical works have covered only a part of these 8 excitations .    in this paper , details of the calculation",
    "are presented in section 2 , and we discuss the results in section 3 comparing our icss and dcss with the previous theoretical and available experimental data . then summary is given in section 4 .",
    "the r - matrix method itself has been described extensively in the literature @xcite as well as in our previous paper@xcite .",
    "thus we do not repeat general explanation of the method here .",
    "we used a modified version of the polyatomic programs in the uk molecular r - matrix codes @xcite .",
    "these programs utilize the gaussian type orbitals ( gto ) to represent target electronic states as well as a scattering electron .",
    "although most of the previous r - matrix works in electron n@xmath0 collisions have employed slater type orbitals ( sto ) , we select gto mainly because of simplicity of the input and availability of basis functions . in the r - matrix calculations",
    ", we have included 13 target states ; @xmath11 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath20 and @xmath19 .",
    "the potential energy curves of these target electronic states are shown in figure [ fig1 ] for reference .",
    "these target states were represented by valence configuration interaction wave functions constructed by state averaged complete active space scf ( sa - casscf ) orbitals .",
    "note that some target states , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath19 , are rydberg states and can not be described adequately in the present valence active space .",
    "inclusion of these states are intended to improve quality of the r - matrix calculations by adding more target states in the model , as in our previous works @xcite as well as other r - matrix works @xcite . test calculation was performed with an extra @xmath21 orbital in the target orbital set",
    ". however , the target excitation energies as well as the excitation cross sections did not change much compared to the results with valence orbital set described above . also , removal of @xmath22 orbital from target active space did not affect the result much in our calculation . in this study ,",
    "the sa - casscf orbitals were obtained by calculations with molpro suites of programs @xcite .",
    "the target orbitals were constructed from the [ 5s3p1d ] level of basis set taken from sarpal et al .",
    "@xcite . in our fixed - bond r - matrix calculations ,",
    "the target states were evaluated at the equilibrium bond length @xmath23 = 2.068 a@xmath24 of the n@xmath0 @xmath25 ground electronic state .",
    "although we also performed calculations with @xmath23 = 2.100 a@xmath24 as in the previous r - matrix calculation of gillan et al.@xcite , the cross sections with @xmath23 = 2.068 a@xmath24 and @xmath23 = 2.100 a@xmath24 are almost the same .",
    "thus , we will only show the results with the equilibrium bond length of n@xmath0 in the next section .",
    "the radius of the r - matrix sphere was chosen to be 10 a@xmath24 in our calculations . in order to represent the scattering electron , we included diffuse gaussian functions up to @xmath26 = 5 , with 9 functions for @xmath26 = 0 , 7 functions for @xmath26 = 1 - 3 and 6 functions for @xmath26 = 4 and 5 .",
    "exponents of these diffuse gaussians were fitted using the gtobas program @xcite in the uk r - matrix codes .",
    "in addition to these continuum orbitals , we included 8 extra virtual orbitals , one for each symmetry .",
    "we constructed the 15-electron configurations from the orbitals listed in table [ tab0 ] .",
    "the ci target wave functions are composed of the valence orbitals in table [ tab0 ] with the 1@xmath27 and 1@xmath28 orbitals kept doubly occupied .",
    "we have included 3 types of configurations in the calculation .",
    "the first type of configurations has the form , @xmath29 here we assume that the total symmetry of this 15 electrons system is @xmath30 .",
    "the first 4 electrons are always kept in the 1@xmath27 and 1@xmath28 orbitals , then the next 10 electrons are distributed over the valence orbitals with restriction of target state symmetry , @xmath31 symmetry of the n@xmath0 ground state in this case .",
    "the last electron , the scattering electron , occupies one of the diffuse orbitals , of @xmath32 symmetry in this example . to complete the wave function with the total symmetry @xmath30",
    ", we also have to include configurations with the other target states combined with diffuse orbitals having appropriate symmetry in the same way as in the example .",
    "the second type of configurations has the form , @xmath33 where the scattering electron occupies a bound @xmath34 extra virtual orbital , instead of the diffuse continuum orbitals in the expression ( 1 ) .",
    "as in table [ tab0 ] , we included one extra virtual orbital for each symmetry .",
    "the third type of configurations has the form , @xmath35 in this case , the last 11 electrons including the scattering electron are distributed over the valence orbitals with the restriction of @xmath30 symmetry .",
    "note that the third type of configurations are crucial in description of n@xmath36 resonance states , which often have dominant contributions to the excitation cross sections . in this way , the number of configurations generated for a specific total symmetry is typically about 60000 , though the final dimension of the inner region hamiltonian is reduced to be about 600 by using ci target contraction and prototype ci expansion method @xcite .",
    "the r - matrix calculations were performed for all 8 irreducible representations of the d@xmath37 symmetry , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , in doublet spin multiplicity of the electron plus target system .",
    "dcss were evaluated in the same way as in our previous paper@xcite .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the potential energy curves of all n@xmath0 target states included in the present r - matrix model .",
    "these curves were obtained by the same sa - casscf method employed in our r - matrix calculation .",
    "table [ tab1 ] compares the excitation energies of the n@xmath0 target states from the present calculation with the previous r - matrix results of gillan et al.@xcite , multi - reference coupled cluster results of ben - shlomo and kaldor @xcite as well as experimental values .",
    "since these energies are evaluated at different inter - nuclear distance , 2.068 @xmath46 in our case , 2.100 @xmath46 in gillan et al.@xcite and 2.074 @xmath46 in ben - shlomo and kaldor @xcite , precise comparison is not so meaningful .",
    "however , deviations of excitation energies from the experimental values are less than 0.8 ev in our calculation , which is good considering the level of calculation . in terms of excitation energies ,",
    "our calculation and the previous r - matrix calculation of gillan et al.@xcite have similar quality .",
    "in addition to this good agreement of target energies with experimental results , n@xmath47 energies are also well described in our sa - casscf calculation . in our calculation , n@xmath47 @xmath48 and @xmath49 states are located at 15.63 and 17.21 ev above n@xmath0 @xmath50 state , respectively . compared to the experimental values of 15.61 and 17.08 ev , our sa - casscf calculation gives good results .",
    "note that the energy ordering of n@xmath47 @xmath48 and @xmath49 states are not well described in the hartree fock level calculation , see ermler and mclean @xcite for example .",

    "below 90 degrees , slope of the calculated dcss at 17.5 ev is similar to the results of khakoo et al.@xcite , zubek and king @xcite and cartwright et al .",
    "@xcite , though our results are about 50% larger than their dcss . in general",
    ", our results do not agree well with the experimental dcss .",
    "although the ics of khakoo et al .",
    "@xcite at 15 ev agrees well our result as shown in panel ( d ) of fig.[fig3 ] , angular dependence of the cross sections appears to be different .",
    "the excitation icss of the @xmath65 state , shown in panel ( b ) of figure [ fig2 ] , have a small bump around 13 ev .",
    "however , there is no such structure in the previous r - matrix icss of gillan et al . @xcite .",
    "the origin of this bump in our calculation is the n@xmath36 @xmath66 state , with main configuration of @xmath56 .",
    "the existence of the n@xmath36 @xmath55 state can also be verified by usual casscf calculation on n@xmath36 with valence active space ignoring continuum orbitals . in molpro calculation , the energy of the @xmath55 state is 15.7 ev . since diffuse continuum orbitals are added in the r - matrix calculation , the energy of the state is stabilized to be 12.8 ev in the present scattering calculation . in the same way , the n@xmath36 @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) resonance peak in the @xmath67 excitation icss can be verified by usual casscf calculation . in molpro calculation , it is located at 14.7 ev , whereas the position of the resonance is stabilized to be 12.2 ev in our r - matrix scattering calculation .",
    "it is unclear why the bump in the icss of the @xmath65 state is not evident in the previous r - matrix cross sections of gillan et al.@xcite .",
    "some details of the r - matrix calculations are different in their calculation and ours , e.g. , they used hybrid orbitals with slater type functions , whereas we employed sa - casscf orbitals with gaussian type functions .",
    "these difference may contribute to the difference in magnitude of the @xmath68 partial cross section .    in this study , we employed the fixed - nuclei ( fn ) approximation . as we can see in figure [ fig1 ] , equilibrium bond lengths of the excited n@xmath0 states are longer than that of the ground state .",
    "thus , in principle , it would be desirable to include the effect of nuclear motion in the r - matrix calculation .",
    "use of the fn approximation may be responsible for several discrepancies between our calculation and experiments , including bumps in the icss of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 states , the position of the peak in the icss of the @xmath8 state .",
    "although the calculated dcss agree very well with experimental results in general , our dcss of the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 states at 12.5 ev are 2 - 4 times larger than experimental results .",
    "these deviations in the near - threshold dcss can also be related to the fn approximation . in spite of these discrepancies ,",
    "good agreements are observed between our calculation and experiments in most ics and dcs cases as we can see in the figures .",
    "agreements with the recent experimental results of khakoo et al.@xcite and johnson et al .",
    "@xcite are especially impressive .",
    "it is possible to include nuclear motion in the r - matrix formalism through vibrational averaging of t - matrix elements or the non - adiabatic r - matrix method , though application of these methods will be a difficult task in the presence of many target electronic states . in the future",
    ", we plan to perform the r - matrix calculation with these methods including nuclear motion .",
    "we have investigated electron impact excitations of n@xmath0 molecule using the fixed - bond r - matrix method which includes 13 target electronic states , @xmath11 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath20 and @xmath19 .",
    "these target states are described by ci wave functions in the valence cas space , using sa - casscf orbitals .",
    "gaussian type orbitals were used in this work , in contrast to the stos in the previous r - matrix works .",
    "we have obtained integral cross sections as well as differential cross sections of excitations to the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 states , which have been studied a lot experimentally but not enough theoretically before . in general ,",
    "good agreements are observed both in the integrated and differential cross sections , which is encouraging for further theoretical and experimental studies in this field .",
    "however , some discrepancies are seen in the integrated cross sections of the @xmath1 and @xmath8 states , especially around a peak structure .",
    "also , our dcss do not agree well with the experimental results at low impact energy of 12.5 ev , compared to the higher energies of 15 and 17.5 ev .",
