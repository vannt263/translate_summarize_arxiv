    "blazars are the most extreme variety of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) known .",
    "their signal properties include irregular , rapid variability ; high optical polarization ; core - dominant radio morphology ; flat ( @xmath10 ) radio spectra ; apparent superluminal motion ; and a broad continuum extending from the radio through the gamma - rays . the broadband emission from blazars is dominated by non - thermal processes ( synchrotron and inverse - compton radiation ) , likely emitted by a relativistic jet pointed close to our line of sight ( as originally proposed by blandford & rees in 1978 )",
    ". the properties of misdirected blazars are consistent with those of radio galaxies , which form the so - called `` parent population '' within unified schemes ( e.g. , urry & padovani 1995 ) .    as a consequence of their peculiar orientation with respect to our line of sight ,",
    "blazars represent a rare class of sources , which make up considerably less than @xmath11 of all agn ( padovani 1997 ) .",
    "therefore , currently available blazar samples suffer from small number statistics and relatively high limiting fluxes ( @xmath12 1 jy and a few @xmath13 erg @xmath7 s@xmath8 in the radio and x - ray band respectively ) .",
    "the small size of these samples ( @xmath14 objects ) implies , for example , that the derivation of the beaming parameters based on luminosity function studies ( e.g. , padovani & urry 1990 ; urry , padovani & stickel 1991 ) is considerably uncertain , especially at low powers .",
    "moreover , our understanding of the blazar phenomenon is mostly based on relatively bright and intrinsically luminous sources , which means we have only sampled the tip of the iceberg of the blazar population .    in paper i ( perlman et al .",
    "1998 ) we presented the methods , the first 85 identifications , and some preliminary results of the deep x - ray radio blazar survey ( dxrbs ) , a large - area ( @xmath15 deg@xmath16 depending on the x - ray flux ) survey , which reaches relatively faint x - ray ( a few @xmath6 erg @xmath7 s@xmath8 ) and radio ( @xmath4 mjy , depending on declination ) fluxes .",
    "the newly identified dxrbs blazars expanded the range of @xmath17 values found among blazars with emission lines by an order of magnitude , and for the first time sampled the faint end of the radio luminosity function of flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) and bl lacs with reasonable statistics . moreover , a large fraction of dxrbs bl lacs were of the so - called `` intermediate '' type , i.e. , spanning a range of @xmath18 values in between the classical low - energy peaked bl lacs ( lbl ) and high - energy peaked bl lacs ( hbl ; padovani & giommi 1995 ) .",
    "this region of parameter space was almost completely unexplored until very recently ( but see also laurent - muehleisen et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "this paper presents new identifications for 106 sources . in section 2",
    "we briefly describe the dxrbs sample and the selection technique and discuss the radio spectral indices we obtained in the context of source selection .",
    "section 3 discusses the results of our optical spectroscopy and the makeup of the dxrbs blazar sample as of july 2000 .",
    "section 4 reviews some of the sample properties , in particular the redshift distribution .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section 5 .",
    "the selection technique and identification procedures used for dxrbs have been described in detail in paper i. in   2.1",
    "we briefly summarize the main points , while in   2.2 we discuss the derivation of the radio spectral index , the main criterion for our candidate selection .",
    "dxrbs takes advantage of the fact that all blazars are relatively strong x - ray and radio emitters .",
    "therefore , selecting x - ray and radio sources with flat radio spectrum ( one of the defining properties of the blazar class ) is a very efficient way of finding these rare sources . by adopting a spectral index cut @xmath19 dxrbs : 1 . selects all fsrq ( defined by @xmath20 ) ; 2 . selects basically all bl lacs ; 3 . excludes the large majority of radio galaxies .",
    "dxrbs uses a cross - correlation of all serendipitous x - ray sources in the publicly available _ rosat _ database wgacat ( first revision : white , giommi & angelini 1995 ) , having quality flag @xmath21 ( to avoid problematic detections ) , with a number of publicly available radio catalogs . north of the celestial equator , we used the 20 cm and 6 cm green bank survey catalogs north20 cm and gb6 ( white & becker 1992 ; gregory et al . 1996 ) , while south of the equator we used the 6 cm parkes - mit - nrao catalog pmn ( griffith & wright 1993 ) . all sources with radio spectral index @xmath22 at a few ghz and off the galactic plane ( @xmath23 ) were selected as blazar candidates .    for objects south of the celestial equator , where a survey at a frequency different from the one of the pmn ( 6 cm ) was missing when we started this project ( the nvss [ condon et al .",
    "1998 ] , now available , reaches in any case only @xmath24 ) , we conducted a snapshot survey with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) at 3.6 and 6 cm .",
    "this not only gave us arcsecond radio positions for our southern sources ( we use the nvss for the northern ones ) but also radio spectral indices unaffected by variability . in ",
    "2.2 we will compare the spectral indices derived from these different surveys .",
    "the details of the cross - correlations and the criteria for the definition of the sample are given in paper i. briefly , the _ rosat _ wgacat was initially correlated with the gb6 and pmn catalogs with a radius of @xmath25 . the correlation radius",
    "was then expanded to @xmath26 for the inner @xmath27 of the _ rosat _ position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) field of view , excluding sources for which the ratio between x - ray / radio offset and positional error was larger than 2 ( and therefore likely to be spurious ) .",
    "a radius of @xmath26 is roughly equal to twice the combined x - ray and radio positional uncertainty of a source with pspc offset @xmath28 and radio flux @xmath4 mjy ( the typical radio flux limit of the pmn , which is declination dependent ; in the north our flux limit is given by the north20 [ @xmath29 mjy at 20 cm ] ) .    in the meantime , we have somewhat expanded our criteria to increase completeness .",
    "first , in the inner @xmath28 of the pspc field of view we have included flat - spectrum radio sources with ratio of x - ray / radio offset to positional error between 2.0 and 2.5 .",
    "second , we have added sources in the @xmath30 pspc offset range having a correlation radius with the gb6 and pmn catalogs up to @xmath26 .    a preliminary comparison of the radio flux distributions in the inner ( @xmath31 ) and outer ( @xmath30 ) regions of the pspc shows no dependence on the pspc offset for @xmath32 mjy .",
    "therefore we expect to be complete down to this radio flux up to @xmath33 .",
    "a detailed discussion of the completeness of dxrbs will be presented in a future paper .",
    "one of the strengths of dxrbs is the radio spectral index cut which allows us to take advantage of one of the defining blazar properties , a relatively flat radio spectrum , to select blazars very efficiently .",
    "ideally , the selection should be done primarily on radio core - dominance , the ratio between core and extended radio flux , known to be @xmath34 in blazars ( e.g. , murphy , browne & perley 1993 ; perlman & stocke 1993 ; kollgaard et al .",
    "1996 ) , but derivation of this parameter requires dedicated radio observations .",
    "dxrbs makes use of the fact that the more core - dominated an object is , the flatter its radio spectral index ( impey & tapia 1990 ) , and sets the cut at @xmath35 to guarantee inclusion of all bl lacs .",
    "( this is the limiting value for the bl lacs with x - ray - to - radio flux ratios typical of our survey within the multiwavelength agn catalog of padovani , giommi & fiore 1997 ) .",
    "additionally , this cut excludes the majority of radio galaxies .",
    "the radio spectral indices for dxrbs sources have been derived as follows :    * @xmath36 : from the gb6 and north20 catalogues ; + @xmath37 therefore covers the @xmath38 ghz range ( @xmath39 cm ) ; * @xmath40 : from our own atca snapshot survey ; + @xmath37 therefore covers the @xmath41 ghz range ( @xmath42 cm ) ; * @xmath43 : in this declination range we have access to our atca observations and also to pmn - nvss data ( @xmath44 ghz range ) . for consistency with the northern part of the survey",
    ", we decided to use pmn - nvss data .    in the following",
    "we review the atca observations and discuss this latter point .",
    "the atca survey was undertaken in two parts : 163 sources with @xmath45 were observed on 1995 november 11 - 13 ; and a further 108 sources ( four of which were repeat observations because of bad data during the first run ) were observed on 1997 october 27 - 28 . during this second run",
    "we included all sources south of @xmath46 .",
    "we observed at 4.8 and 8.6 ghz since confusion due to nearby sources within the primary beam is more severe at lower frequencies for a snapshot survey like ours .",
    "the atca data were reduced using the miriad software package . during the observations ,",
    "target sources were interleaved with secondary calibrators which were used for phase calibration .",
    "the absolute flux density scale was determined from the primary calibrator pks 1934@xmath47638 . over an entire observing run , typically 3 snapshots , each lasting 2 minutes ,",
    "were taken for every source .",
    "these snapshots were separated in hour angle by roughly 4 hours , with some adjustments made to allow the schedule to run smoothly .",
    "this procedure allowed efficient observation of a large number of objects . however , as the atca is a linear array with only 6 antennae , the coverage of the @xmath48 plane obtained for each source was clearly very limited .",
    "the calibrated data were imaged , and source positions were found from a fit to the peak pixel in the image .",
    "while these positions are accurate to @xmath49 for compact sources , the very sparse @xmath48 coverage resulted in poor quality images .",
    "for an extended source with no compact `` core , '' the position of the brightest pixel is dependent on the sampling , hence the positional error for an extended source may be larger than a few arcseconds .",
    "source flux densities were estimated directly from the calibrated visibilities . a lower limit to the total flux density of each source",
    "was estimated from the visibilities corresponding to the shortest baseline ( 337 m and 153 m for the data taken in 1995 and 1997 respectively ) . for 1995 ,",
    "when the majority of the atca data were collected , this shortest available baseline gives a synthesised beam of fwhm @xmath50 at 4.8 ghz ( half of this at 8.6 ghz ) .",
    "thus , for sources which have extended emission with angular diameter much larger than this , some of the extended emission is missing in this atca data .",
    "the longest baseline in the atca is close to 6 km , which results in @xmath51 resolution at 4.8 ghz and @xmath52 resolution at 8.6 ghz . due to the sparse sampling of the @xmath48 plane mentioned above ,",
    "there are no sufficient data to fit a detailed model to a complex source , or to make a detailed image of a source with extended structure .",
    "the level of extended structure in each source was estimated by comparing the visibility amplitudes corresponding to the flux density for the shortest and longest spacings in the dataset and confirmed by visual examination of plots of amplitude versus distance in the @xmath48 plane .    to calculate the flux density of the unresolved , compact component , a point source was fitted to the visibilities of each source using the miriad task _",
    "uvfit_. there are two contributions to the error in measurement of the flux density of a point source : a random noise component of the order of 1 mjy rms , and a calibration error which is estimated to be no larger than @xmath53 of the total source flux density .",
    "thus the flux density of an unresolved source is measured to high accuracy . however , the amount of possible large - scale structure is inherently uncertain in measurements with a sparse interferometric array such as the atca .",
    "hence , the estimated total flux density of each source should be considered as a lower limit only .      besides allowing us to select candidates for spectroscopy in advance of the completion of the nvss , the original stated purpose of the atca observations ( paper i ) was to help us gauging the effect of using non - simultaneous data to derive spectral indices , and hence to include in our sample true blazars which might otherwise be excluded .",
    "our atca data give us radio spectral indices unaffected by variability , since the observations at both frequencies are truly simultaneous , but in a higher frequency range than that used for our northern objects . on the other hand ,",
    "radio spectral indices derived from pmn - nvss data cover the more standard @xmath38 ghz and are less affected by either spatial filtering or poor @xmath48 coverage , but involve non - simultaneous data and have angular resolution no better than @xmath54 ( condon et al .",
    "the pmn - nvss radio spectral indices were derived by summing up all nvss sources within @xmath55 from the pmn position , given the different beam sizes of the two surveys .",
    "( padovani et al . , in preparation , show that this procedure is robust and gives radio spectral indices in very good agreement with those derived from single dish measurements . )",
    "we expect the values of @xmath56 to be correlated with @xmath57 , with perhaps a small offset indicative of steepening in the synchrotron spectrum at higher frequencies .    in figure 1",
    "we compare the values of @xmath56 and @xmath58 for all sources in the declination range @xmath59 .",
    "the locus of equal spectral indices is represented by a dotted line .",
    "as expected , while the scatter is fairly large , probably due to variability and to the different spatial scales sampled by the pmn / nvss surveys and the atca ( see below ) , the two spectral indices are well correlated ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the mean values of the two spectral indices are however somewhat different .",
    "we find @xmath61 while @xmath62 , and a mean difference of @xmath63 .",
    "this comparison includes all sources and is therefore not appropriate : an extended source , which will typically have a relatively steep @xmath57 , will be resolved out more at 8.6 ghz than at 4.8 ghz with the atca , due to the smaller primary beam area at the higher frequency .",
    "such a source will therefore have an even steeper @xmath56 .",
    "a more meaningful comparison is that between the two spectral indices for relatively compact sources , which are the ones we are interested in .",
    "for this purpose , we estimated a core - dominance parameter , i.e. the ratio between core and extended flux , from our atca data at 4.8 ghz .",
    "note that only a lower limit is available for the extended flux and therefore our core - dominance parameters are upper limits to the true value .    keeping all this in mind ,",
    "figure 1 shows the distribution of the two spectral indices for sources with core - dominance parameter at 4.8 ghz @xmath64 ( filled points ) and @xmath65 ( open points ) .",
    "as expected , most of the lobe - dominated ( @xmath65 ) sources have both @xmath56 and @xmath66 . the difference between the two spectral indices is clearly reduced for core - dominated objects .",
    "we find @xmath67 , while @xmath68 , and a mean difference of @xmath69 .    in the case of a direct proportionality between the two spectral indices",
    ", all sources should populate the two areas of the diagram defined by @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , @xmath73 ( the bottom - left and top - right areas , denoted in figure 1 by the two dashed lines ) .",
    "this is `` almost ''",
    "the case : only 23/138 ( @xmath74 ) of the sources fall outside these regions . by choosing as our selection criterion for inclusion in the sample @xmath71",
    ", we are conservatively including most ( 19/23 ) of these outliers .",
    "ten of these sources , however , have @xmath65 and their blazar classification might be questionable . as regards the four sources in the top - left part of the figure , excluded by our criterion",
    ", one has @xmath65 , while the maps of the other three show that they are at least partially extended .",
    "some of the sources in figure 1 with flat @xmath57 but marked ( @xmath75 ) steepening at high frequencies could be gigahertz peaked spectrum ( gps ) sources ( e.g. , odea 1998 ) . for these sources , and for those with @xmath72 ,",
    "we give the @xmath76 values as footnotes to table 5 .",
    "thus our conclusion is that among our sources we observe a steepening in spectral index between @xmath77 ghz and @xmath41 ghz of @xmath78 , which reduces to 0.13 when considering only the sources likely to be compact . by applying the same cut of @xmath79 in the declination range @xmath80 , where we have only @xmath41 ghz spectral indices available for our candidate selection",
    ", we are missing no more than three blazar candidates , included otherwise if @xmath57 were available and less than @xmath81 ( as the majority of our blazars are fsrq ) .",
    "we estimate this number by considering the sources included in fig . 1 with @xmath82 .",
    "of these , only @xmath83 have @xmath84 and @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , the use of higher resolution data in a slightly different frequency range does not affect strongly our selection of blazar candidates .    as discussed in   3.2 ,",
    "spectral indices over a relatively limited frequency range are used to establish the blazar nature of a source .",
    "are all our quasars with @xmath20 blazars ?",
    "are they all core - dominated ?",
    "we plan to address these questions in our future work with the help of our atca maps , and dedicated , high resolution radio observations .",
    "the dxrbs sample now comprises about 350 candidates of which @xmath9 are identified . in paper",
    "i , classifications for 85 newly identified objects and 97 previously known sources were given . in this section",
    "we present 102 additional new identifications and 4 higher signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) spectra for objects previously published in paper i , namely wgaj0421.5 + 1433 , wgaj0528.5@xmath475820 , wga j1057.6@xmath477724 and wgaj1222.6 + 2934 .",
    "note that , as stated in paper i , the newly identified objects include not only objects meeting the strict selection criteria but also some lower priority sources ( dxrbs objects at low galactic latitude , below the radio completeness limits , or with @xmath85 ) .",
    "these are marked with an asterisk in table 5 .",
    "accurate ( @xmath86 ) positions to pinpoint the optical counterpart and allow spectroscopical identification were obtained from the nvss or from our atca observations .",
    "finders were produced using the digitized sky survey ( dss ) via skycat ( albrecht et al . 1997 ) .",
    "magnitudes were derived for relatively bright objects ( @xmath87 , @xmath88 ) from the cambridge apm project ( irwin , maddox & mcmahon 1994 ) for the northern sources and edinburgh cosmos catalogue for the southern objects ( drinkwater , barnes & ellison 1995 ) .",
    "candidates without counterparts on dss plates were imaged at the kpno 0.9 m , wiyn 3.5 m , ctio 0.9 m , and eso 2.2 and 3.6 m telescopes .",
    "spectroscopic observations were conducted at the kpno 2.1 m and 4 m , and at the eso 2.2 m and 3.6 m telescopes .",
    "multiple grisms were used in some runs in order to maximize snr for faint objects and obtain higher dispersion for brighter objects . in table 1",
    "we list the resolution and approximate wavelength range of the grisms used in our telescope runs . in table 2",
    "we list the details of the observations .",
    "since we expected most of our sources to be quasars , the exposure times were calculated based on this assumption .",
    "this rendered the identification of weak emission and absorption features in our spectra rather difficult .",
    "the spectra acquired during the september 1998 and february 1999 runs have a fairly low snr due to bad weather conditions .",
    "spectra observed with the eso 3.6 m and kpno 4 m were taken at parallactic angle , except in cases where the radio / x - ray error circle contained two candidates .",
    "observations at parallactic angle were not possible at the eso 2.2 m and kpno 2.1 m telescopes , which require a manual slit rotation .    * table 1 . * grism properties +    [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     the numbers to the right in columns ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) refer to sources which fulfill all dxrbs selection criteria .",
    "the subsample of sources which fulfill all our selection criteria [   2 and paper i ] and which will be used for the detailed analysis is now 85% identified .",
    "it includes 275 objects , of which 222 are quasars ( 175 fsrq and 47 ssrq ) , 31 are bl lacs , and 22 are nlrg .",
    "an eso very large telescope ( vlt ) program to identify 15 very faint ( @xmath89 ) dxrbs candidates has been partially completed ( data reduction is in progress ) ; another such program is currently under way .",
    "approximately 50 sources remain to be identified ( about half of them have been observed during our eso run in august 2000 ; data reduction is in progress ) .",
    "these sources are about one magnitude fainter than the rest of the dxrbs sample ( @xmath90 as compared to 18.3 ) . based on our results so far ,",
    "we expect them to be mostly quasars at relatively high ( @xmath91 ) redshifts . with this in mind",
    ", we now review the properties of the sample .",
    "figure 2 displays the fractional redshift distribution of the dxrbs quasars compared to the quasars found in the s4 ( @xmath92 jy ) and 1 jy ( @xmath93 jy ) surveys ( stickel & khr 1994 ; stickel , meisenheimer & khr 1994 ) .",
    "note that dxrbs quasars have been selected to have @xmath94 .",
    "therefore the s4 and 1jy distributions shown here comprise the quasars from these samples defined on the same basis .    while for the s4 and 1 jy surveys the area of the sky covered is the same at all fluxes ( 5,624 and 32,208 deg@xmath16 respectively ) , this is not the case for dxrbs . due to the serendipitous nature of the survey and the variable sensitivity of the _ rosat _ pspc detector across the field of view , the area in which faint x - ray sources could be detected is smaller than that for brighter x - ray sources .",
    "the dxrbs redshift distribution has therefore been de - convolved with the appropriate sky coverage and this is what is shown in fig .",
    "2 . namely , each bin represents @xmath95 for all the sources in that bin , where area@xmath96 is the area accessible at its x - ray flux , divided by the total surface density of sources .",
    "error bars represent the @xmath97 range based on poisson statistics .",
    "we note that the sky coverage is difficult to determine in the parts of the pspc field of view affected by the rib structure ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "that area , and the sources within , have therefore been excluded from the analysis presented in this subsection . moreover , only sources with @xmath99 mjy have been included since we still not have computed the sky coverage of the pmn survey below this flux .",
    "as the radio flux limit of the quasar samples drops from 1 jy to @xmath100 jy , the approximate limit of the dxrbs , a progression towards higher redshifts is clearly seen , as expected .",
    "the mean redshift , in fact , moves from @xmath101 for the 1 jy , to @xmath102 for the s4 , to @xmath103 for the dxrbs sample .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test shows that the dxrbs redshift distribution is significantly different ( @xmath104 ) from the 1 jy and s4 distributions .",
    "the mean values are also different at the same significance level .",
    "considering that the dxrbs quasar sample is @xmath105 complete and that the missing sources are likely to be at relatively high ( @xmath91 ) redshift , we expect the final mean redshift to be even higher . compared to the s4 and 1 jy samples , a larger fraction of dxrbs quasars are at relatively high redshift .",
    "in fact , dxrbs finds @xmath106 of its quasars at @xmath107 ( once the effect of the wgacat sky coverage is taken into account ) , whereas only @xmath108 of the s4 and 1 jy quasars lie above this redshift .",
    "figure 3 displays the redshift distribution of the dxrbs bl lacs , compared to that of the 1 jy ( stickel et al . 1991 ; stickel & khr 1994 ; stocke & rector 1997 ) and emss ( rector et al .",
    "2000 ) samples .",

    "we have not included bl lacs from the _ einstein _ slew survey ( perlman et al .",
    "1996a ) in this plot because the sky coverage of that survey is not fully known yet .",
    "five emss redshifts are uncertain , while four 1 jy redshifts are lower limits ( hatched areas in fig . 3 ; five more 1 jy sources have a lower limit on their redshift of 0.2 based on the non - detection of their host galaxies on the optical image ) .",
    "note that the fraction of bl lacs with redshift information ranges from @xmath109 and @xmath110 for the emss and 1 jy samples respectively to @xmath111 for dxrbs .",
    "half of the dxrbs bl lacs without a determined redshift are previously known objects , and therefore have not been spectroscopically observed by us .",
    "the mean redshift for the three bl lac samples is 0.24 for dxrbs , 0.46 for the emss , and 0.63 ( including lower limits ) for the 1 jy . the dxrbs and emss samples are peaked at @xmath112 and @xmath113 respectively , and neither sample has significant numbers of @xmath114 objects ( @xmath115 in the emss and @xmath116 in the dxrbs ) . by comparison ,",
    "the 1 jy bl lacs have an essentially flat redshift distribution out to nearly @xmath117 , with 10/32 1 jy bl lacs at @xmath118 and 5 at @xmath119 .",
    "in contrast to the quasars , no progression to higher redshifts is seen for the bl lacs as the radio flux limit drops from 1 jy , for the 1 jy sample , to 0.05 jy for the dxrbs .",
    "similarly , no progression of this kind is seen as the x - ray flux limit drops from a few @xmath13 erg @xmath7 s@xmath8 for the emss to a few @xmath6 erg @xmath7 s@xmath8 for the dxrbs . in this paper , however , we will not attempt a detailed comparison of the three bl lac redshift distributions . at this stage , this would not be meaningful , first because , as mentioned above , about one third of the dxrbs bl lacs are not included in figure 3 since they lack redshifts , and second because the identification of dxrbs is not @xmath120 complete yet",
    ". we would only like to note that the criteria employed to classify objects as a bl lac were somewhat different in each of these surveys . as we previously pointed out in paper i , while the spectroscopic criteria employed for dxrbs and the emss were identical ( once the emss criteria were expanded to take into account the march et al .",
    "( 1996 ) expansion of the original bl lac region in the @xmath121 plot ; see rector et al .",
    "1999 for discussion ) , the emss did not require a flat radio spectrum to classify an x - ray source as a candidate bl lac .",
    "the 1 jy survey used a different set of criteria to classify objects as bl lacs , requiring @xmath122 and @xmath123   but with no restriction on the ca break .",
    "in addition , as was detailed in paper i and perlman et al .",
    "( 1996b ) , the 1 jy survey was often inconsistent in applying its selection criteria .",
    "similar points have also been made by other authors ( march & browne 1995 ; stocke & rector 1997 ; rector , stocke & perlman 1999 ) .",
    "we note the striking difference in redshift range between bl lacs and quasars , the latter reaching @xmath124 , the former only getting up to @xmath125 .",
    "note that , while @xmath126 of dxrbs bl lacs lack a redshift determination , that is not the case for the emss and 1 jy samples for which redshifts are available for @xmath3 of the sources .",
    "although one can not exclude the possibility that the missing redshifts are all relatively high , the point remains that the mean redshift values for bl lacs and quasars _ belonging to the same sample _ are significantly different .",
    "finally , the redshift distribution for the radio galaxies in our sample reaches only @xmath127 and is skewed towards low redshifts , with @xmath128 .",
    "because it reaches much lower fluxes than any previously published sample of fsrq ( by a factor @xmath129 in radio flux and by a factor 10 in x - ray flux ) , dxrbs has vastly expanded the coverage of parameter space for fsrq in complete samples .",
    "these expansions occur in two regions of the @xmath130 plane : ( 1 ) at low luminosities ; ( 2 ) at high @xmath17 values , with the discovery of a new class of x - ray bright fsrq .    at the low luminosity end",
    ", dxrbs includes at present @xmath131 more fsrq with @xmath132 than the s4 and 1 jy samples combined .",
    "about 40 dxrbs fsrq are in fact already known at these low powers , and this will put strong constraints on the fsrq radio luminosity function ( lf ) . for comparison ,",
    "note that the radio lf derived by urry & padovani ( 1995 ) from the 2 jy sample ( the only published high frequency sample with relatively complete redshift information ) included only one source at @xmath133 , a power which coincides roughly with the predicted flattening of the lf based on unified schemes .",
    "five of these low - power objects are in a luminosity range never before reached for fsrq : @xmath134 w hz@xmath8 , the former being the expected minimum luminosity of fsrq assuming these objects are beamed fr ii radio galaxies .",
    "paper i discussed the finding of a large fraction ( @xmath135 ) of x - ray bright ( @xmath136 or @xmath137 ) fsrq in the dxrbs , and termed them high - energy peaked fsrq ( hfsrq ) , stressing the similarity in their broadband spectral shapes to the high - energy peaked bl lacs .",
    "the fraction of hfsrq in the dxrbs is now @xmath138 .",
    "we also find 14 high - energy peaked ssrq . by comparison ,",
    "the previously known complete samples included very few of these objects ( @xmath139 in total ) .",
    "as discussed in paper i , the reason for this discrepancy is because dxrbs is the first x - ray survey which included the radio spectral slope in its identification process , thus for the first time allowing the identification of a sample of x - ray emitting fsrq .",
    "importantly , further research on other samples has shown that the x - ray / radio luminosity distribution of dxrbs fsrq is not anomalous",
    ". a slightly larger percentage of these objects is found among the fsrq in the rgb survey ( laurent - muehleisen et al .",
    "1998 , padovani et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , which goes to somewhat larger values of @xmath17 but at higher x - ray flux than dxrbs . moreover , subsequent archival research on the _ einstein _ emss and slew samples ( perlman et al . 2000 ) has also shown similar fractions of hfsrq .",
    "as regards bl lacs , dxrbs will be providing the first complete radio - selected sample down to @xmath4 mjy , an improvement of a factor of 20 in flux over the 1 jy sample , still the only sizeable bl lac radio - selected sample .",
    "the similar improvement in radio powers will allow us to extend the radio lf of radio - selected bl lacs down to @xmath140 , again getting close to the expected minimum powers according to unified schemes ( urry & padovani 1995 ) .",
    "moreover , due to their low x - ray fluxes , dxrbs bl lacs are also reaching more than an order of magnitude lower @xmath141 than , for example , the emss or slew samples .      a broader picture of the dxrbs sample is shown in fig .",
    "4 , which plots the @xmath142 , @xmath143 plane for dxrbs sources . these are the usual effective spectral indices defined between the rest - frame frequencies of 5 ghz , 5,000  , and 1 kev .",
    "x - ray and optical fluxes have been corrected for galactic absorption .",
    "the effective spectral indices have been k - corrected using the appropriate radio and x - ray spectral indices , available for each source .",
    "optical fluxes at 5,000   have been derived and k - corrected as described in padovani et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "the dashed lines represent , from top to bottom , the loci of @xmath144 , typical of 1 jy quasars with @xmath145 and bl lacs , @xmath146 , the dividing line between hbl and lbl , and @xmath147 , the upper boundary for emss bl lacs .",
    "a few points are worth noticing in the figure :    1 .   the majority of dxrbs bl lacs occupy a somewhat intermediate area in @xmath148 space , in between those occupied by the 1 jy and emss bl lac samples .",
    "such objects are also being found in other _",
    "rosat_-based surveys , for example rgb ( laurent - muehleisen et al . 1998 , 1999 ) ,",
    "rc ( kock et al . 1996 ) and hqs / rass ( nass et al . 1996 ) .",
    "it is now clear that the bimodal distribution observed for the 1 jy and emss samples ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "12 of padovani & giommi 1995 ) was due to selection effects and that deeper surveys are now filling the gap in parameter space .",
    "note that due to our x - ray and radio flux limits only a handful of dxrbs bl lacs have effective spectral indices typical of classical hbl ( e.g. , the emss sample ) .",
    "dxrbs quasars have significantly lower ( @xmath149 ) @xmath148 than 1 jy quasars : @xmath150 versus @xmath151 .",
    "this corresponds to an x - ray - to - radio luminosity ratio on average a factor of 2 larger for dxrbs . as discussed above , dxrbs , by reaching relatively deep radio fluxes , is sampling the low @xmath148 ( high @xmath17 ) end of the quasar distribution . in particular , @xmath138 of dxrbs fsrq have @xmath152 values typical of hbl , as compared to only @xmath139 for the 1 jy sample .",
    "3 .   nlrg are concentrated towards the bottom right - hand corner of the diagram and are characterized by relatively low @xmath142 values ( @xmath153 ) and relatively high @xmath143 values ( @xmath154 ) .",
    "this is due to the strong thermal ( stellar ) component present in these sources .",
    "note that although some bl lacs are also present in this region , the mean @xmath143 values for the two classes ( @xmath155 and @xmath156 for bl lacs and radio galaxies respectively ) are significantly different ( @xmath157 ) .",
    "4 .   still unclassified sources are , on average , fainter in all bands than identified ones but mostly so in the x - rays .",
    "this explains the fact that they occupy the high @xmath148 part of the @xmath142 , @xmath158 plane , the region typical of extreme fsrq .",
    "the impact of these findings , both for bl lac and fsrq , on our multiwavelength picture of the blazar class will be discussed in a future paper .",
    "dxrbs takes advantage of three of the most dominant blazar properties , namely relatively strong x - ray and radio emission , and a flat radio spectrum , to select a large sample of flat - spectrum radio quasars and bl lacs . reaching 5 ghz",
    "radio fluxes @xmath4 mjy and @xmath5 kev x - ray fluxes a few @xmath6 erg @xmath7 s@xmath8 , dxrbs is the faintest and largest flat - spectrum radio sample available to date mapping previously unexplored regions of parameter space .    as of july 2000 , our sample is @xmath105 identified and contains 298 sources , of which 234 ( 79% )",
    "are quasars , 36 ( 12% ) are bl lacs and 28 ( 9% ) are radio galaxies .",
    "thus our technique has an efficiency of @xmath3 at finding radio - loud quasars and bl lacs .",
    "we have a measured redshift for 96% of our identified objects .",
    "our main results are the following :    1 .   the dxrbs finds a large fraction of quasars at high redshift : 30% of dxrbs quasars have @xmath107 ( once the effect of the wgacat sky coverage is taken into account ) , as compared to 15% of the quasars with @xmath0 in the 1 jy and s4 surveys combined .",
    "2 .   the dxrbs has vastly expanded coverage of the faint end of the radio luminosity function both for bl lacs and fsrq .",
    "forty of our 181 dxrbs fsrq are at @xmath159 w hz@xmath8 , compared to only 10 out of 300 in the 1 jy and s4 samples combined .",
    "five of these are in the luminosity range @xmath160 w hz@xmath8 , the former being the expected minimum luminosity of fsrq assuming these objects are beamed fr ii radio galaxies .",
    "+ as regards bl lacs , dxrbs will be providing the first complete radio - selected sample down to @xmath4 mjy , an improvement of a factor of 20 in flux over the 1 jy sample , still the only sizeable bl lac radio - selected sample .",
    "the similar improvement in radio powers will allow us to extend the radio lf of radio - selected bl lacs down to @xmath140 , again getting close to the expected minimum powers according to unified schemes .",
    "dxrbs has filled large holes in the coverage of the @xmath161 parameter space , both for quasars and bl lacs .",
    "prior to dxrbs , basically no fsrq within complete samples were known at values of @xmath162 , while 28% of fsrq in our sample fall in this category .",
    "the discovery of such objects raises new challenges for our understanding of blazar physics .",
    "+ dxrbs contains a large number of bl lacs with @xmath163 , that is with spectral shapes `` intermediate '' between the `` classical '' radio- and x - ray selected sources .",
    "such objects are also being found in other _",
    "rosat_-based surveys , which shows that the bimodal distribution observed for the 1 jy and emss samples was simply due to selection effects .",
