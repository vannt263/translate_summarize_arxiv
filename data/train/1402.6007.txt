    "bec , dissipation due to interaction of the vortices with thermal excitations will cause the vortices to spiral out of the trap , or vortices of opposite circulation to annihilate one another and convert their energy into acoustic energy within the bec .",

    "the system is at a temperature @xmath10  nk , and the bec critical temperature at this point is @xmath11  nk .",
    "once the hold period ends , the central barrier is ramped off over 0.25  s , the trapping potential is removed , and the bec ballistically expands for @xmath1250  ms and is then observed using standard absorption imaging techniques . for the cases in which a persistent current about the central barrier exists prior to barrier ramp - down and expansion , a hole was observed in the expanded density distribution ; the area of the core can be used to determine the winding number of superfluid flow around the central barrier  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the bec may be held for an additional 3  s in the trap after the barrier ramp off but before the expansion imaging procedure , allowing the vortices to separate and become experimentally distinguishable . in this case , the number of vortices observed corresponds to the winding number of the current that was pinned prior to barrier ramp - down .",

    "the time - dependent drop in vortex number can be caused by any mechanism that destabilizes a vortex pinned to the central barrier , allowing it to spiral out of the bec , although such vortex dynamics were not directly confirmed in the experiment .",
    "if the central barrier was instead removed at the _ beginning _ of the hold period , immediately after equilibration , and the system was left to evolve in a purely harmonic trap , the mean number of vortices observed dropped at a faster rate .",

    "this relative drift could result from beam drift due to movement by the laser mirrors , or due to changes in the magnetic trap position due to a changing temperature of the magnetic field coil .",

    "@xmath29 is the repulsive potential due to a blue - detuned laser - beam potential of peak barrier energy @xmath30 and gaussian radius @xmath31 centered at 2d position @xmath32 relative to the center of the harmonic trap @xmath33 , enabling stability analysis for both on - center and off - center beams .",

    "the resulting equation of motion for this hamiltonian system @xmath42 , is the gross - pitaevskii equation  @xcite , where @xmath43 is the functional gradient of @xmath44 , @xmath45 with @xmath46 the identity operator and @xmath47 interchanges row @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    "the gpe can be written as : @xmath50 of particular importance for our considerations in what follows will be the stability of stationary solutions @xmath51 to eq .",
    "( [ gpe ] ) .",
    "this is determined by the eigenvalues @xmath52 of the hessian of the hamiltonian , @xmath53 , and excitation spectrum @xmath54 of the resulting linearization operator @xmath55 which corresponds to bogoliubov - de gennes analysis  @xcite . when considering the excitation spectrum of single or multi - vortex states , we find in it the existence of negative energy modes  @xcite .",
    "negative energy eigenvalues ( also referred to as anomalous modes ) of @xmath56 indicate _ energetic instability _ , since `` dissipative '' perturbations ( e.g. ,  from exchanges of atoms with the thermal cloud if the temperature deviates from zero ) in the system can render them _ dynamically unstable _ , as can collisions with other eigendirections having positive energy even in the purely hamiltonian ( zero - temperature ) system .",
    "nevertheless , in the latter case , energetic instability of an excited state such as a dark soliton or a vortex  @xcite does not necessarily lead to dynamical instability .",
    "thus these modes reveal the potential of such an excited state towards genuine dynamical instability which arises in both of the above mentioned scenarios .",
    "the linear stability / excitation spectrum of the system is monitored through the eigenvalues @xmath57 of @xmath58 ; dynamical instability arises when @xmath59 since , due to the hamiltonian structure , the eigenvalues feature a four - fold symmetry over the real and imaginary axes . from prior experience ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which is confirmed again here , linear stability generically indicates evolutionary _ nonlinear ( orbital ) stability _ in the mean - field model , at least for time scales monitored of the order of tens of seconds , i.e. , comparable to the lifetime of the bec .",
    "an additional key observation is that the number of negative energy modes depends on the topological charge , or winding number @xmath60 of the multi - vortex configuration considered  @xcite . in particular , @xmath60 is mathematically defined as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the boundary of a region containing the vortices , @xmath63 is the superfluid velocity of the condensate and @xmath64 is the phase associated with the complex valued wavefunction @xmath65 . to examine the role of small amplitude excitations to a stationary vorticity bearing solution @xmath66 , ] where @xmath67 is the polar angle , perturbations of the form",

    "in particular , if we set @xmath71 then @xmath72 , so a single index @xmath73 will dictate the angular dependence of the excitation with given eigenvalue @xmath74 .",
    "hence , the spectrum of eigenvalues @xmath54 can be decomposed as the union of the spectra @xmath75 pertaining to perturbations of index @xmath73 .",
    "it has been shown numerically @xcite and analytically @xcite that instability windows arise in a solution with topological charge @xmath60 only for indices @xmath76 .",
    "the null eigenvalues corresponding to the phase or gauge [ u(1 ) ] invariance of the gpe model appear in the spectrum of @xmath77 . for a vortex in a harmonic trap",
    ", there is an anomalous mode for @xmath78 that is typically not resonant with any modes of positive energy , accounting for the dynamical stability of the @xmath1 vortex discussed earlier .",
    "we also note that this mode converges to zero as @xmath79 , restoring translational invariance in the limit and leading to the energetic stability of the @xmath1 vortex without external potential  @xcite . for each @xmath80 in the case of @xmath2 ,",
    "an anomalous mode can lead to windows of instability , as has been shown , e.g. , in refs .",
    "one of the principal points of the present work is to illustrate that for experimental parameters in use in current experiments , such anomalous modes can be completely _ suppressed _ for a strong enough gaussian pinning potential @xmath81 , even if the pinning potential is not centered at the center of the harmonic trap .",
    "indeed , the modes not only cease to resonate with positive modes and no longer lead to dynamical instability windows , but for even higher laser powers ( and hence larger @xmath30 ) , they undergo a transition from negative to positive energy .",
    "this precludes the existence of any such resonances and lends energetic stability to the corresponding multi - charge vortex state .",
    "an important comment is that such energetic stability enhances the observability of these higher charge configurations .",
    "this is contrary to the experimental difficulties in observing such higher charge vortices in the absence of the barrier considered herein , as reported earlier in ref .",
    "the theoretical explanation of such enhanced observability has to do with the fact that , as mathematically proved in ref .",
    "@xcite and numerically illustrated , e.g. , for the case of single charge vortices in ref .",
    "@xcite , the presence of arbitrarily small dissipative perturbations immediately destabilizes these anomalous modes .",
    "the role of dissipative perturbations in the case of becs is played by the lossy coupling to thermal atoms ( in any realistic finite temperature setting ) . as a result",
    ", vortices develop complex excitation frequencies in their spectra  @xcite that lead to their well - known spiraling out of the condensate ; see , e.g. , ref .",
    "this effect is stronger for higher charge vortices , as the latter bear more anomalous modes as indicated above .",
    "hence , the energetic stabilization of these anomalous modes ( in the absence of dissipation ) `` shields '' the multi - charge state from such a detrimental effect .",

    "the next two columns focus on the specific case of @xmath82 and again fixed @xmath40 and monitor the _ non - monotonic _ dependence of the critical @xmath30 , as the width @xmath31 of the barrier is increasing .",
    "finally , for fixed charge @xmath60 and width @xmath31 , once again it is intuitively expected ( and shown in the rightmost two columns of the table ) that for stabilization , the maximum energy of the pinning potential needs to be higher for larger numbers of atoms in the bec .",
    "these diagnostics yield a sense of the dependencies of the vortex stabilization barrier parameters , as the beam width , charge , and atom number in the bec are varied .",

    "however , the experimental data are contained within ( and show a similar trend as ) the theoretically determined stability limits , lending support to the predictions of the theoretical results .",
    "if the beam drift is primarily responsible for the decay of the current , the comparison between theoretical and experimental data suggests that it is possible that other factors such as thermal fluctuations may need to be considered for accurate prediction of persistent current stability conditions .",

    "when such an on - center solution is shifted just slightly off - center ( i.e. , perturbed ) , the energetic instability manifests immediately , and it becomes dynamically unstable if the dynamics followed is dissipative ( due to the instability of the remaining anomalous mode as explained above ) .",
    "such a setting will still be in the energetic stability regime for the charge @xmath60 solution , since energetic stability is robust to such small shifts of symmetry , as displayed in fig .",

    "the precise value of the dissipation @xmath113 , and its relation with the temperature of the bec , is not relevant since _ any _ amount of dissipation will destabilize a dynamically stable but energetically _ unstable _ solution .",

    "in the present work , we described the results of experiments in which vorticity with winding number up to @xmath82 can be pinned to a laser beam in a bec .",

    "<S> we study conditions under which vortices in a highly oblate harmonically trapped bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) can be stabilized due to pinning by a blue - detuned gaussian laser beam , with particular emphasis on the potentially destabilizing effects of laser beam positioning within the bec . </S>",
    "<S> our approach involves theoretical and numerical exploration of dynamically and energetically stable pinning of vortices with winding number up to @xmath0 , in correspondence with experimental observations . </S>",
    "<S> stable pinning is quantified theoretically via bogoliubov - de gennes excitation spectrum computations and confirmed via direct numerical simulations for a range of conditions similar to those of experimental observations . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical and numerical results indicate that the pinned winding number , or equivalently the winding number of the superfluid current about the laser beam , decays as a laser beam of fixed intensity moves away from the bec center . </S>",
    "<S> our theoretical analysis helps explain previous experimental observations , and helps define limits of stable vortex pinning for future experiments involving vortex manipulation by laser beams . </S>"
