    "recently , three groups have used molecular spectral line observations to reveal fast ( @xmath7  km s@xmath5 ) kpc  scale , massive ( @xmath8 ) outflows in the nearby quasar mrk231 .",
    "other galaxies show indications of similar phenomena ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these appear to show how quasar feedback can transform young , star  forming galaxies into red and dead spheroids .",
    "all three groups reach this conclusion for mrk231 essentially by noting that the mass outflow rate @xmath9 and the kinetic energy rate @xmath10 of the outflow are too large to be driven by star formation , but comparable with those predicted in numerical simulations of agn feedback .",
    "the kinetic energy rate is a few percent of the likely eddington luminosity @xmath11 of the central black hole , of mass @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 is the electron  scattering opacity ) .",
    "the outflowing material must have a multi - phase structure , because @xmath14 greatly exceeds the velocity corresponding to the molecular dissociation temperature ( @xmath15 km  s@xmath5 ; see section 5 below ) .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite we showed that large ",
    "scale flows of this type ( technically , an energy  driven flow , see section 3 ) can indeed drive much of the interstellar gas out of a galaxy bulge on a dynamical timescale @xmath16  yr , leaving it red and dead , provided that the central supermassive black hole accretes for about twice the salpeter time after reaching the value set by the @xmath17 relation . in @xcite",
    "we showed that the remaining bulge mass is close to the value set by the observed black ",
    "hole  bulge ",
    "mass relation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however we did not investigate the observable features of this process , including in particular the way that the interstellar gas is swept up .",
    "we return to this problem here , as it offers a clear observational test of the idea that agn outflows are responsible for making galaxies red and dead . to keep our treatment as general as possible ( specifically , independent of the details of numerical simulations ) we adopt a simple analytic approach .",
    "we find that this process predicts outflow velocities @xmath18  kms@xmath5 , and mass outflow rates up to @xmath19 , several hundred times the eddington value , in good agreement with observations .",
    "in addition , we find that the observable momentum outflow rate is @xmath20 times greater than @xmath21 of the driving agn , also in agreement with observations .",
    "we conclude that agn outflows are good candidates for the agency sweeping galaxies clear of gas .",
    "to drive outflows with @xmath22 approaching @xmath2 at large radius , the active nucleus of a galaxy must somehow communicate this luminosity from its immediate vicinity .",
    "direct transport by radiation is problematic , not least because galaxies are generally optically thin ( however , dust opacity may be large enough to absorb this radiation and provide feedback ; see * ? ? ?",
    "jets are sometimes invoked , but are relatively inefficient because they tend to drill holes in the interstellar medium rather than driving it bodily away .",
    "accordingly the most likely connection is via high  velocity wide ",
    "angle winds expelled from the vicinity of the nucleus by radiation pressure ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recent observations suggest that such winds are very common in agn . in this paper",
    ", we use the term ` wind ' to refer to the mildly relativistic ( @xmath23 ) ejection of accretion disc gas from the immediate vicinity of the smbh resulting from eddington accretion , and ` outflow ' ( see section 4 ) for the large  scale nonrelativistic flows caused by the interaction between the wind and the galaxy s ambient gas .",
    "the winds have simple properties . with mass rate @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the eddington accretion rate and @xmath26 is the accretion efficiency , a wide  angle wind has scattering optical depth @xmath27 @xcite , assuming that the covering factor of absorbing gas is close to unity ( see the discussion below eqn [ v ] ) .",
    "so each driving photon on average scatters about once before escaping to infinity and gives up all of its momentum to the wind , so that the wind mass flow rate @xmath28 and velocity @xmath29 obey @xmath30 defining @xmath31 as the eddington factor of the wind , we immediately find",
    "@xmath32 ( cf * ? ? ?",
    "the likely ionization equilibrium of the wind is such that it produces x ",
    "rays @xcite . in line with these expectations , blueshifted x  ray iron absorption lines corresponding to velocities @xmath33 are seen in a significant fraction of local agn , justifying our assumption of a covering factor close to unity . in all cases",
    "the inferred wind mass flow rates agree with eqn .",
    "( [ mom ] ) .",
    "so these black hole winds have momentum and energy rates @xmath34 and @xmath35 where we have used eqns ( [ mom ] , [ v ] ) in eqn ( [ edot ] ) .",
    "the expression ( [ edot ] ) for the energy rate of a black hole wind is obviously promising for driving the observed large  scale outflows .",
    "although the interstellar medium is clumpy , the outflow bubble inflated by the wind easily sweeps past the clumps , affecting the diffuse gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , the clouds are shocked by the passing outflow and evaporate inside the hot wind bubble @xcite , so most of their material also joins the outflow . a detailed treatment of the interaction between the clumpy ism and the wind  driven outflow is beyond the scope of this paper ,",
    "although we address some of the implications in section 6 . in the present analysis",
    "we assume that most of the sightlines from the smbh are covered with diffuse medium , irrespective of whether they are also obscured by clumps .",
    "the question now is how efficiently the wind energy is transmitted to the outflow .",
    "this depends crucially on how the wind interacts with the diffuse interstellar medium of the host galaxy .",
    "since the wind is hypersonic , it must decelerate violently in a reverse shock , and simultaneously drive a forward shock into the host ism .",
    "there are two possible outcomes , which are realised under different conditions in galaxies .",
    "the first outcome ( momentum  driven flow ) occurs if the shocked wind gas can cool on a timescale short compared with the motion of the shock pattern . in this case",
    "the shocked wind gas is compressed to high density and radiates away almost all of the wind kinetic energy ( i.e. @xmath36 ) .",
    "this shocked wind has gas pressure equal to the pre  shock ram pressure @xmath37 , and this pushes into the host ism .",
    "the second case ( energy  driven flow ) occurs if the shocked wind gas is not efficiently cooled , and instead expands as a hot bubble .",
    "then the flow is essentially adiabatic , and has the wind energy rate , i.e. @xmath38 ( from eqn [ edot ] ) .",
    "the hot bubble s thermal expansion makes the driving into the host ism more vigorous than in the momentum  driven case . observed galaxy ",
    "wide molecular outflows must be energy  driven , as demonstrated directly by their kinetic energy content ( cf eqn [ edot ] ) .    which of these two very different cases occurs at a given point depends on the cooling of the shocked gas .",
    "it is easy to show that the usual atomic cooling processes ( free  free and free  bound radiation ) are negligible in all cases .",
    "the dominant process tending to cool the shocked black hole wind is the inverse compton effect @xcite .",
    "the quasar radiation field is much cooler than the wind shock temperature ( typically @xmath39  k and @xmath40  k respectively ) , and so cools the shocked wind provided that it is not too diluted by distance .",
    "equations 8 and 9 of @xcite show that this holds if and only if the shock is at distances @xmath41  kpc from the active nucleus , since the compton cooling time goes as @xmath42 and the flow time typically as @xmath43 .",
    "so we expect momentum  driven flow close to the nucleus , and energy  driven flow if gas can be driven far away from it .",
    "we note that @xcite claim that an energy ",
    "driven flow never occurs .",
    "however they seem to have considered the cooling of the ambient gas , rather than the shocked wind and swept  up ism : the cooling function they use extends only to temperatures @xmath39  k , rather than the wind shock temperature @xmath44  k  see @xcite for details .",
    "for an isothermal ism density distribution with velocity dispersion @xmath45 and gas fraction @xmath46 ( the ratio of gas density to background potential density ) one can solve analytically the equation of motion for the shock pattern for both momentum  driven flow @xcite and energy ",
    "driven flow @xcite .    in the momentum ",
    "driven case there are two distinct flow patterns , depending on the black hole mass @xmath12 . for @xmath47 , where @xmath48 ( with @xmath49 ( its cosmological value ) and @xmath50 ) the wind momentum is too weak to drive away",
    "the swept  up ism , and the flow stalls at some point . for @xmath51",
    "the wind momentum drives the swept  up matter far from the nucleus .",
    "it is intuitively reasonable to assume that the black hole can not easily grow its mass significantly beyond the point where it expels the local interstellar gas in this way , i.e. beyond @xmath52 .",
    "equation ( [ msig ] ) is very close to the observed @xmath17 relation , despite having no free parameter .",
    "detailed calculations @xcite show that the smbh is likely to grow for 1 - 2 additional salpeter times after it reaches @xmath52 , increasing its final mass by a factor of a few .",
    "this process is even more pronounced at higher redshift , as then it takes longer for the outflow to clear the galaxy , so the smbh must be active for longer .",
    "we conclude that outflows drive gas far from the nucleus , and thus become energy  driven , once @xmath53 .",

    "this may be lower than the value @xmath46 prevailing when the earlier momentum  driven outflow establishes the @xmath17 relation ( [ msig ] ) , as gas may be depleted through star formation for example .",
    "the solutions ( [ ve ] , [ dotr ] ) describe the motion of the contact discontinuity where the shocked wind encounters swept  up interstellar gas ( see figure [ fig : outflow ] ) .",
    "the observed molecular lines are likely to come from the shocked interstellar gas ahead of this discontinuity  its temperature is much lower ( @xmath39  k ) than that of the shocked wind , as we shall see .",
    "the outer shock must run ahead of the contact discontinuity into the ambient interstellar medium in such a way that the velocity jump across it is a factor @xmath62 ( where @xmath63 is the specific heat ratio ) .",
    "this fixes its velocity as @xmath64 ( where we have used @xmath65 in the last form ) .",
    "this corresponds to a shock temperature of order @xmath66  k for the forward shock into the interstellar medium ( as opposed to @xmath67 for the wind shock ) . since the outer shock and the contact discontinuity are very close together when energy  driven flow starts ( see fig . [",
    "fig : outflow ] ) this means that the outer shock is always at @xmath68 the outflow rate of shocked interstellar gas is @xmath69 assuming @xmath70 , the wind outflow rate is @xmath71 we can now define a mass  loading factor for the outflow , which is the ratio of the mass flow rate in the shocked ism to that in the wind : @xmath72 then the mass outflow rate is @xmath73 if the agn is still radiating at a luminosity close to eddington , we have @xmath74 , and using ( [ ve ] ) gives @xmath75 and @xmath76 for typical parameters , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "if the central quasar is no longer active , the mass outflow rate evidently declines as @xmath79 times this expression , with @xmath80 given by ( [ dotr ] ) .",
    "it is easy to check from ( [ vout ] , [ out ] ) that the approximate equality @xmath81 holds , i.e. most of the wind kinetic energy ultimately goes into the mechanical energy of the outflow , as expected for energy driving .",
    "one can show from the equations in @xcite that if the quasar is still active and accreting close to its eddington rate , the shocked wind retains @xmath82 of the total incident wind kinetic energy @xmath83 , giving @xmath84 to the swept  up gas .",
    "the energy retained in the wind and the swept  up gas have potentially observable emission signatures ( see discussion ) .",
    "equation ( [ energy ] ) means that the swept  up gas must have a momentum rate greater than the eddington value @xmath85 , since we can rewrite it as @xmath86 where the @xmath87 s are the momentum fluxes . with @xmath88 , we have @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the mass loading factor of the outflow .",
    "the factor @xmath91 is the reason why observations consistently show @xmath92 .",
    "we have shown that large  scale outflows driven by wide ",

    "our equations ( [ vout ] , [ out ] ) directly relate the outflow velocities and mass rates to the properties of the host galaxy .",
    "the outflows should have mechanical luminosities @xmath95 , but ( scalar ) momentum rates @xmath96 .",
    "these predictions agree well with observations ( see tables [ table : obs ] and [ table : pred ] ) .",
    "we conclude that agn outflows may well be what sweeps galaxies clear of gas .",
    "our picture predicts several other features that may aid in interpreting observations .",
    "it suggests that the molecular outflows come from clumps of cool gas embedded in the outflowing shocked ism .",
    "they are entrained by the advancing outer shock front and persist for a long time .",
    "we note that this shock front is rayleigh  taylor stable since interstellar gas is compressed here .",
    "further , the temperature of the shocked ism is in the right range for thermal instability @xcite , and richtmyer - meshkov instabilities @xcite induced by the forward shock mean that new cold clumps may form in the outflow behind it .",
    "simulations by zubovas & nayakshin ( in preparation ) show that up to @xmath97 of the total mass in the outflow may be locked up in this cold phase .",
    "this agrees with the conversion factor of @xmath98 used in the papers cited in table [ table : obs ] to estimate the total mass outflow rate from observed molecular species .",
    "our model therefore predicts both the total mass outflow rates ( eqn [ out ] ) and the observational signatures used to estimate them , in good agreement with observation ( table [ table : pred ] ) .",
    "the inner wind shock presumably accelerates cosmic ray particles , and gamma rays result when these hit the colder ism and shocked wind .",
    "the outflows are therefore directly comparable with the gamma  ray emitting bubbles in our galaxy recently discovered by _",
    "one can interpret these as relics of the milky way s last quasar outburst about 6  myr ago by noting that the greater density of the galactic plane must pinch a quasi ",

    "the gamma ",
    "ray emission from distant galaxies discussed here should be intrinsically stronger than in the milky way , but the long integration time required to detect the galactic bubbles means that these outflows may be undetectable with current instruments .",
