    "<S> motivated by the new observed scalar boson of 126 gev at atlas and cms , various phenomena in two - higgs - doublet model ( thdm ) are investigated broadly in the literature . for considering the model that possesses a solution to the massive neutrinos </S>",

    "<S> , we have a completely different decay pattern for doubly charged higgs ( @xmath0 ) , even the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of higgs triplet is at gev level , which is limited by the precision measurement for @xmath1-parameter . for illustrating the new characters of the model , we study the influence of new interactions on the new open channels @xmath2 with @xmath3 being the lightest charged higgs . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , due to the new mixing effect , the triplet charged higgs could couple to quarks in the model ; therefore , the search for @xmath4 via @xmath5 by mediated @xmath6 becomes significant .    </S>",
    "<S> the recent observation of a new scalar particle at 126 gev by atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite shows that the higgs mechanism is a right direction not only for the origin of masses of gauge bosons but also for the masses of quarks and charged leptons in the standard model ( sm ) . by this point of view , the most mysterious observed phenomenon in particle physics is the masses of neutrinos . besides the undetermined mechanism of neutrino masses , we also know nothing about their mass ordering , which is classified by normal ordering , inverted ordering , and quasi - degeneracy in the literature  @xcite .    before the observations of neutrino oscillations , numerous mechanisms for generating the neutrino masses had been proposed . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , type - i seesaw @xcite mechanism introduced the heavy right - handed neutrinos while the type - ii seesaw mechanism @xcite extended the sm by including a @xmath7 higgs triplet . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , other possibilities were also investigated such as adding the new triplet fermions  @xcite , radiative corrections  @xcite , etc . due to the similarity in mass generation mechanism between type - ii seesaw and higgs mechanism </S>",
    "<S> , we focus the study on the simplest extension to the type - ii seesaw model .    </S>",
    "<S> the characters of type - ii seesaw model with one higgs doublet and one higgs triplet can be briefly summarized as follows : first , doubly charged higgs decays to the same sign charged gauge bosons ( ww ) and leptons ( @xmath8 ) , where the former coupling is associated with vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of triplet denoted by @xmath9 and the latter is related to the multiplication of yukawa couplings and @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the involved parameters are limited to be small by the observed neutrino masses . </S>",
    "<S> second , for achieving the small @xmath9 , one needs to require either a small massive coupling for @xmath10 term or a heavy mass scale for higgs triplet ; we will see this point later . if we adopt the mass scale of higgs triplet to be of @xmath11 gev , it is then inevitable to have a hierarchy in the massive parameters of lagrangian . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , if one requires leptonic decays of doubly charged higgs to be dominant , because of the requirement of vacuum stability , the coefficient @xmath12 of @xmath13 term in the scalar potential has to be @xmath14 gev . </S>",
    "<S> third , the singly charged higgs of triplet does not couple to quarks .    from theoretical viewpoint , the two - higgs - doublet model ( thdm ) was proposed for solving the weak and strong cp problems  @xcite . in spite of the original motivation , thdm itself </S>",
    "<S> provides rich phenomena in particle physics . by the new discovery of 126 gev scalar boson at atlas and cms , </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenology of thdm has been further investigated broadly in the literature , e.g. refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . since the thdm does not have the mechanism to generate the masses of neutrinos </S>",
    "<S> , according to the discussions on the conventional type - ii seesaw model ( cttsm ) , the massive neutrinos indeed could originate from a higgs triplet with a non - vanished vev . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in this paper , we study the extension of cttsm by including one extra higgs doublet , i.e. two - higgs - doublet ( thd ) and one higgs triplet model . we find that unlike the case in cttsm , the couplings @xmath15 of @xmath16 terms in the scalar potential could be as large as electroweak scale when the small @xmath9 is satisfied . moreover , the @xmath17 terms cause the new mixing effects in singly charged higgses and new decay channels for doubly and singly charged higgses </S>",
    "<S> . then the mixing of charged higgses from doublets and triplet can be large , which is small in cttsm due to the small @xmath12 coupling . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , these new effects will change the search of doubly charged higgs at colliders  @xcite and affect the rare decays in low energy physics , such as @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , etc . @xcite . in order to better understand the new characters of the extended model , in the following we briefly introduce the model . </S>",
    "<S> the involved higgs doublets and triplet are denoted by @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> , we impose a @xmath26 symmetry at the yukawa interactions . under the symmetry , </S>",
    "<S> the transformations of matter fields are given by h_2 - h_2 ,   u_r -u_r with @xmath27 being the right - handed up - type quarks . </S>",
    "<S> the other fields are unchanged in the @xmath26 transformation . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the yukawa couplings are written by -l_y & = & |q * y^d * d_r h_1 + |q * y^u * u_r h_2 + |l * y^ * _ r h_1 + & + & , [ eq : lang_y ] where we have suppressed all flavor indices , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the @xmath30 doublets of quarks and leptons , @xmath31 in turn denotes the @xmath30 singlet for down - type , up - type quarks and charged leptons , and @xmath32 with @xmath33 being the second pauli matrix . </S>",
    "<S> the detailed discussions for the yukawa couplings could refer to ref .  @xcite . since the signal of doubly charged higgs is clearer and unique in type - ii seesaw model , in this study we will focus on the decays associated with @xmath0 . by eq .  </S>",

[ eq : d++w ] we see clearly that the coupling of @xmath4 to @xmath58 is proportional to @xmath9 . in cttsm , the value of @xmath9 determines which decaying channel is the dominant mode , @xmath59 or @xmath60 channel . since @xmath0 and @xmath61 belong to the same multiplet and get the masses from @xmath62 before ewsb , the possible mass difference @xmath63 is at most of @xmath64 </S>",

    "<S> the two - loop effects are roughly expressed by m^_ ~ ( * h*)_ _ 1 i_2 , where we only consider the contribution of @xmath79 term , @xmath174 denotes the two - loop effect , @xmath175 is from the vertex of @xmath176 in eq .  </S>",

    "<S> as known that @xmath91 belongs to the @xmath7 triplet and can not couple to quarks directly . </S>",
    "<S> however , the interactions of @xmath91 with quarks are built in our model through the mixing of @xmath91 and @xmath88 , which is arisen from the @xmath173 terms of scalar potential . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we open not only a new channel for the search of @xmath0 , but also a new way to look for it . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , if @xmath185 gev and @xmath186 gev , the signal for the existence of @xmath4 could be read via the decay @xmath187 , i.e. @xmath188-jet+@xmath189 in the final state , where the signal of @xmath4 becomes completely different from the cttsm .    in summary , we have studied the new interactions in two - higgs - doublet type - ii seesaw model . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the small vev of higgs triplet could be satisfied by accommodating the free parameters in the new scalar potential , i.e. @xmath82 , @xmath62 , @xmath190 , etc . </S>",
    "<S> , where these massive parameters could be the same order of magnitude . by neglecting the contributions of @xmath9 , </S>",
    "<S> the charged higgs mixing could be described by one mixing angle @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> the mixing angle is dictated by the parameters @xmath191 and @xmath154 . </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated that by taking proper values of @xmath117 and @xmath154 , the new decay channels @xmath192 are dominant in @xmath4 decays , except at very tiny @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> since the decay pattern of @xmath0 is different from that in cttsm , the search for @xmath0 and the limit on its mass should be further studied at the colliders . </S>",
