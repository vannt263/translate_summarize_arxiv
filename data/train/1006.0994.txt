    "one of the important atomic processes governing ionic charge abundances in plasmas is dielectronic recombination ( dr ) .",

    "\\label{eq : reaction}\\ ] ] due to the importance of dr in plasma processes , there has been a large body of systematic experimental and theoretical work on dr .",
    "the present status of the field is reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "an excellent review of current theoretical methods of treating dr may be found in refs .",
    "dr calculations were carried out using configuration - interaction ( ci ) , multi - configuration hartree - fock ( mchf ) , and techniques of many - body - perturbation theory ( mbpt ) with the help of standard codes , such as grasp @xcite , civ3 @xcite , mchf code @xcite , autostructure  @xcite , and others . for electron temperatures @xmath1 ev , there is a good agreement between calculated and measured dr rates .",
    "however , for @xmath2 ev there are significant disagreements between theory and experiment ( see , e.g , refs .",
    "these discrepancies are usually attributed to theoretical inaccuracies in the positions of low - energy resonances @xmath3 ev .",
    "even small shifts of such resonances to the lower energies lead to underestimating the dr rate  @xcite .",
    "the dr process is a resonant process : cross - section spikes at electron kinetic energies that are resonant with internal transitions between bound ionic states . as a result ,",
    "the dr rate coefficients , entering , e.g. , plasma ionization stage calculations , are exponentially sensitive to uncertainties in energies of resonances , @xmath4 .",
    "because of this exponential sensitivity , there is an outstanding and practically - relevant problem : a reliable description of the dr at low temperatures .",
    "this problem has been highlighted , for example , by savin _",
    "et al . _",
    "these authors write , _ `` the single greatest challenge facing modern dr theory is accurately calculating the resonance structure for the low collision energies needed to calculate low - temperature dr . '' _   compared to high energies ( where a simplified rydberg - like description suffices ) , at low excitation energies the positions of involved atomic resonances become sensitive to _ many - body correlations_. solving the correlation problem accurately is a challenging task , and the existing approaches have difficulties in reliably describing the low - temperature dr .    the most accurate method to date in treating",
    "the low - temperature dr is the relativistic many - body theory by the stockholm group ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "our present approach shares essential elements with this highly - successful method : although our computational toolbox is different , it is also based on the many - body theoretical treatment and it is _ ab initio _ relativistic .",
    "there is , however , an important difference : all the enumerated calculations by the stockholm group have final ions , @xmath5 with two electrons outside a closed - shell core .",
    "our methodology is more general and allows one to investigate systems with a larger number of valence electrons .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to evaluate the utility and the accuracy of our approach by comparing our results with the benchmark data of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : method ] we present a discussion of basic formulas of dr ( section  [ sec : drformulas ] ) , the ci+mbpt approach and the complex rotation method .",
    "specifics of the calculations and numerical results for be - like carbon are presented in section  [ sec : c3plus ] .",
    "we start by formalizing the dr reaction , eq .",
    "( [ eq : reaction ] ) , and recapitulating well - known results for the dr cross - section and rate coefficient . in an independent particle picture",
    ", the incident electron of energy @xmath6 excites one of the bound electrons of the @xmath7 ion ( @xmath8 ) and at the same time the initially free electron is captured into one of the excited orbitals @xmath9 of the target ion : this forms a doubly - excited ion @xmath10^{**}$ ] .",
    "this intermediate step is concluded by a radiative decay to a final state below the ionization threshold .",
    "the theoretical description requires two distinct ingredients : capture ( auto - ionizing ) amplitudes due to electron - electron interactions and transition amplitudes due to the photon bath . in the isolated - resonance approximation ( valid for the commonly encountered situation when there are no overlapping resonances of the same symmetry ) , the dr cross - section due to an individual resonance",
    "may be parameterized by the lorentzian  ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath11 here @xmath12 labels the specific resonant state , @xmath13 is the energy of the resonance with respect to the initial state @xmath14 of the @xmath7 ion , and @xmath15 is the width of the resonant metastable state . for a given range of incident electron energies ,",
    "the total cross - section is obtained by summing over the resonances falling within that range .",
    "the strength , @xmath16 , is given by @xmath17 here @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the multiplicities of the resonant and the initial ionic states .",
    "the radiative decay rate from the resonant doubly - excited state , @xmath20 , is the conventional einstein @xmath21 coefficient for spontaneous emission summed over all possible final recombined states .",
    "usually , limiting the radiative decay channels to the electric - dipole transitions is sufficient .",
    "finally , @xmath22 is the capture ( inverse of the auger process ) rate to the resonant doubly - excited state and @xmath23 is the total autoionization rate",
    ". the autoionizing and radiative rates account for the total width of the resonance , @xmath24 .",
    "the above formulation is an approximation : it omits radiative recombination ( rr ) , possible effects of interference between the rr and dr amplitudes , interference between nearby resonances , modification of the lorentzian profile in the vicinity of the threshold , etc . while being approximate , this treatment , however , is known to be of a sufficient quality for practical calculations  @xcite .",
    "our calculations are performed using a method which combines the configuration interaction ( ci ) technique with many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) .",
    "mbpt provides a systematic prescription for solving the atomic many - body problem  @xcite .",
    "basically , the residual ( i.e. , beyond the mean - field , dirac - hartree - fock ( dhf ) , potential ) coulomb interaction between the electrons is treated as a perturbation and one applies machinery similar to the textbook stationary perturbation theory .",
    "the mbpt , when accompanied by a technique of summing up important chains of higher - order diagrams to all orders , produces excellent results for atoms and ions which have only one electron outside closed shells ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "even for an atom as heavy as neutral cs ( 55 electrons ) , the modern _ ab initio _ many - body relativistic techniques demonstrate an accuracy of @xmath25 0.1% for removal energies , hyperfine structure constants , and lifetimes  @xcite . for atoms with two or more valence electrons",
    "the mbpt has significant difficulties .",
    "the dense spectrum of many - valence - electron atoms leads to small energy denominators and the perturbative treatment of the valence - valence correlations breaks down .",
    "an adequate technique in this case is the ci method .",
    "combining ci and mbpt allows one to treat both valence - valence and core - valence correlations to high accuracy .",
    "the ci+mbpt technique has been described in detail in our previous works  @xcite .",
    "below we briefly reiterate its main features . for simplicity ,",
    "let us consider a system with two valence electrons outside a closed shell core ( e.g. , a be - like c@xmath26 ion ) .",
    "the calculations start from the @xmath27 approximation  @xcite , which means that the initial dhf procedure is carried out for the closed - shell ion , with the two valence electrons removed .",
    "the effective ci hamiltonian for the divalent ion is the sum of two single - electron hamiltonians plus an operator representing interaction between valence electrons : @xmath28    the single - electron hamiltonian for a valence electron has the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the relativistic dhf hamiltonian : @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the correlation potential operator describing correlation interaction of the valence electron with the core @xcite .",
    "interaction between valence electrons is the sum of the coulomb interaction and two - particle correlation correction operator @xmath33 : @xmath34 qualitatively , @xmath33 represents the screening of the coulomb interaction between the valence electrons by the core electrons @xcite .",
    "a two - electron wave function @xmath35 for the valence electrons has a form of expansion over single - determinant wave functions @xmath36 where @xmath37 are the slater determinants constructed from single - electron valence basis states calculated in the @xmath27 potential .",
    "the coefficients @xmath38 as well as two - electron energies are found by solving the matrix eigenvalue problem @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "technically , one needs a complete set of single - electron states to calculate @xmath42 and to construct two - electron basis states for the ci calculations . to this end",
    ", we generate a finite basis set using b - splines and the dual - kinetic balance method  @xcite for the @xmath27 dhf potential .    by diagonalizing the effective hamiltonian we find the wave functions ; they are further used for computing atomic properties such as electric - dipole transition amplitudes . to compute matrix elements",
    "we apply the technique of effective all - order ( `` dressed '' ) operators .",
    "in particular , we employ the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "the rpa sequence of diagrams describes a shielding of the externally applied field by the core electrons .",
    "the ci+mbpt calculations for a system with @xmath43 valence electrons follow the very same scheme , with an expansion over slater determinants for @xmath43 electrons . again",
    "the strong interaction between the valence electrons is treated within ci , while the core - valence interactions are taken into account in the mbpt framework ( intermediate states in the operator @xmath44 include core excitations ) .    in principle , the effective hamiltonian @xmath45 for systems with @xmath46 valence electrons includes three - particle operator @xmath47 , whose computation is very costly . in refs .",
    "@xcite this operator was calculated for neutral thallium and respective contribution was found to be negligible .",
    "one can expect that this conclusion should hold for all systems with three - four valence electrons",
    ". for combinatorial reasons the relative role of the three - particle interaction @xmath47 rapidly grows with @xmath43 and one may need to include it for systems with @xmath48 .      using the described ci+mbpt method we can find spectra of multi - valent ions .",
    "this section connects the ci+mbpt method to the dr problem .",
    "a straightforward computation within the ci+mbpt has certain problems , discussed below .",
    "these problems , however , are elegantly solved using the complex rotation method ( crm ) : a relatively minor modification of the ci+mbpt method allows us to compute positions and widths of the dielectronic resonances .    what are the difficulties ?",
    "+ ( i ) the ci+mbpt method starts from a finite set of single - particle states ( orbitals ) computed in a spherical cavity of radius @xmath49 .",
    "the entire continuum in practice is approximated by 20 - 30 orbitals per partial wave ; their individual energies depend on @xmath49 .",
    "the dr doubly - excited resonance states are embedded into the continuum . in some cases , depending on @xmath49 , the resonance state may become degenerate with the quasi - continuum states .",
    "this leads to a requirement that the model ci space includes both the bound and the quasi - continuum many - particle states ( otherwise the perturbative treatment may break down due to small energy denominators ) . _ how would we separate the doubly - excited resonance states of interest from the background quasi - continuum ? _",
    "\\(ii ) straightforward computation of the capture ( auger ) rates starting from the fermi golden rule requires continuum wave - functions .",
    "because we start with the box quantization , we can not easily generate the continuum orbitals of a prescribed energy ( in principle , this is possible by tuning the radius of the cavity , but this is not a very practical solution ) .",
    "_ how do we determine the autoionizing rates without knowing the scattering states ?",
    "_      the complex - rotation method is well established and has been employed in atomic physics and quantum chemistry for several decades ( see , e.g. , a review  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "previously , the crm was successfully applied to the dr problem by e. lindroth and collaborators @xcite . in the crm",
    ", the radial coordinate is scaled by a complex factor @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 being an adjustable parameter .",
    "for example , the radial dirac equation becomes @xmath53 here @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the conventional large and small radial components of the dirac bi - spinors .",
    "for a point - like nucleus @xmath56 .",
    "for the dhf potential , the dependence is more complicated as it involves @xmath52-dependent core orbitals and requires a self - consistent solution .",
    "we have implemented the crm method for the dhf equation using the finite - basis set technique . technically , we employed an expansion over b - splines and the dual - kinetic - balance method  @xcite to avoid the so - called `` spurious '' states .",

    "the generated finite basis is suitable for feeding into the ci+mbpt code .",
    "analytically , the scaling ( [ eq : rthetascaling ] ) does not affect energies of the bound states , but the eigenvalues of the continuum are rotated in the complex plane by @xmath58 .",
