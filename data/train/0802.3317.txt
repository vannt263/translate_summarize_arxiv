    "the hierarchical @xmath4 spin model , with @xmath12 sites per block , has been recently studied by renormalization group in both weak and strong regimes by watanabe @xcite .",
    "starting from the uniform a priori  measure supported in the @xmath8dimensional sphere of radius @xmath13 , the critical trajectory of the rgt has shown to converge to the gaussian fixed point for sufficiently large @xmath8 . to control such trajectory , which starts far away from the fixed point",
    ", the exactly solved @xmath14 trajectory has been used together with two key ingredients : reflection positivity and the lee ",
    "yang property of  single ",
    "site  a priori  measures .",
    "the former ingredient gives uniform convergence of @xmath4 trajectories to @xmath14 trajectories .",
    "the latter property has been previously employed by kozitsky @xcite to establish two central limit theorems .",
    "watanabe s analysis , based in his joint work with hara and hattori @xcite on the critical trajectory for the hierarchical ising model ( @xmath15 ) , in contradistinction to kozitsky s , and most of the previous studies of this model , does not restrict the space of a priori  measures to a neighborhood of the gaussian fixed point and is able to deal with the borderline @xmath0 case .",
    "although the analysis of the rgt with @xmath16 fixed is expected to be simplified considerably in the @xmath6 limit ( see e.g. @xcite ) , none of the above mentioned results can be carried to the limit as the two key ingredients do not hold if @xmath5 is not an integer . in order to establish , in the local potential approximation ( @xmath6 ) , a weak convergence of the hierarchical @xmath4 heisenberg equilibrium measure to the corresponding spherical equilibrium measure as @xmath7 an entirely new method of analysis has to be developed from scratch .    in the present investigation",
    "we establish central limit theorems for the four  dimensional hierarchical spherical ( @xmath10 ) model at and above the critical temperature .",
    "our results are achieved in the local potential approximation that reduces the renormalization group equation to a nonlinear first order partial differential equation . a geometric function interpretation of the @xmath14 trajectory is thus given with the help of an explicit solution obtained by the method of characteristics .",
    "it follows from our analysis that the lee  yang zeroes reach a limit distribution as the gaussian fixed point approaches but their support moves away to infinity .    * the model .",
