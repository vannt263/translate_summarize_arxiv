    "in this paper we study asymptotic properties of spectral and covariance functions of random fields .",

    "transforms the statement `` ( b ) implies ( a ) '' is a theorem of abelian type and the statement `` ( a ) implies ( b ) '' is a tauberian theorem .",
    "abelian and tauberian theorems are not only of their own interest but also have numerous applications in asymptotic problems of probability theory and statistics ( see e.g. surveys in @xcite ) .",
    "we concentrate our studies on homogeneous random fields with long - range dependence ( lrd ) , which appear in various applications in signal processing , physics , telecommunications , hydrology , etc .",
    "the reader can find more details in @xcite and the references thereinafter .",
    "the volume by @xcite contains outstanding surveys of the field .",
    "in particular , that volume discusses different definitions of lrd of stationary processes in terms of the autocorrelation function ( the integral of the correlation function diverges ) or the spectrum ( the spectral density has a singularity at zero ) .",
    "we would like to emphasize that , perhaps to the astonishment of some readers , multidimensional abelian and tauberian theory is more complicated than its one - dimensional counterpart for characteristic functions , and the most results were obtained only in the last two decades .",
    "abelian and tauberian theorems for random fields with singular spectrum are of great importance in the theory of limit theorems for functionals of dependent random variables .",
    "they are a key starting point in proofs of non - gaussian asymptotic behaviour of lrd summands .",
    "several applications to non - central limit theorems for functionals of lrd random fields can be found in @xcite .",
    "abelian and tauberian theorems also have been exploited in various statistical applications .",
    "namely , the lrd phenomenon exhibits itself through a slow decay of covariances at infinity or non - integrable covariance functions .",
    "however , the majority of statistical methods for lrd models , for example , tests for the presence of a lrd component in real data , are based on properties of periodograms / estimators of spectral densities .",
    "these methods have been greatly developed recently , and rely on a local specification of the spectral density in a neighborhood of zero .",
    "the aims of the paper are :    * to collect and adjust known abelian and tauberian theorems to the case of lrd random fields .",
    "similar asymptotic results were obtained in different ares : functional analysis , theory of integral transforms , probability theory , etc .",
    "some of these results appeared in less - known journals or dissertations . consequently",
    ", this literature is not readily available , and thus it is not properly quoted in scholarly publications .",
    "therefore , accurate translations of these results to the terminology of the probability theory and comparisons among themselves are important problems . * to show the variety of generalizations for different functionals and functional classes .",
    "each abelian and tauberian theorem in the paper is a nontrivial extension to new cases .",
    "we present motivating examples , which demonstrate the use of the theorems and their limitations .",
    "the examples also show sharpness of results , i.e. that the theorems do not hold under wider assumptions . * to produce some new examples of covariance and spectral distribution functions of lrd random fields , which have closed - form representations .",
    "these results can be used in applied spatial statistical modeling .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we recall the basic definitions and formulae of the spectral theory of random fields .",
    "section 3 introduces two classes of regularly varying functions .",
