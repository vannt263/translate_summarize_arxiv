    "see , e.g. , @xcite for more details .",
    "the analysis of global rigidity turns out to be more challenging , but substantial progress has been made in the last decade .",
    "the main tool for analyzing global rigidity is a stress matrix introduced by connelly  @xcite .",
    "( for the definition of stress matrices , see , e.g. ,  @xcite . )",
    "connelly  @xcite showed that , if @xmath6 is generic and the rank of a stress matrix of @xmath6 is @xmath30 , then @xmath6 is globally rigid .",
    "he also conjectured that the rank condition is necessary .",
    "this conjecture was recently confirmed by gortler , healy , and thurston  @xcite .",
    "an important corollary of their result is :    [ thm : generic ] if there is a globally rigid generic realization of @xmath8 in @xmath0 , then every generic realization of @xmath8 is globally rigid in @xmath0 .",
    "thus generic global rigidity is a property of graphs , and we can say that a graph @xmath8 is _ globally rigid _ in @xmath0 if some / any generic realization of @xmath8 is globally rigid .",
    "another breakthrough in this context is a combinatorial characterization of globally rigid graphs in @xmath1 by jackson and jordn  @xcite . in  @xcite",

    "a useful method for generating rigid / globally rigid graphs is the so - called _ henneberg operation _ , that is , an operation that creates a new graph by adding a new vertex . for a graph @xmath2 , a _ 0-extension _ in @xmath0 adds a new vertex with @xmath5 new edges incident to the new vertex , and a _ 1-extension _ in @xmath0 removes an existing edge @xmath35 and adds a new vertex with @xmath31 new incident edges so that the new vertex is incident with the both endvertices of @xmath35 .",
    "it is known that both operations preserve the rigidity of graphs in @xmath0 , which gives a proof of laman s theorem in case of @xmath36 , see  @xcite .",
    "analogously , connelly showed that the 1-extension preserves the corank of stress matrices and conjectured that for @xmath36 every graph satisfying hendrickson s condition can be generated from @xmath37 by a sequence of 1-extensions and edge additions .     for @xmath36",

    "in particular , the result by connelly  @xcite , jackson and jordn  @xcite implies not only the existence of a globally rigid generic realization of a 3-connected redundantly rigid graph but also theorem  [ thm : generic ] for @xmath36 .",

    "their results lead to a proof of theorem  [ thm : generic ] which relies on deep graph - theoretical observations , which is still important as the proof of theorem  [ thm : generic ] in @xcite mainly consists of geometric / algebraic observations .    however",

    "we extend @xmath161 to @xmath16 such that @xmath12 is generic and @xmath404 .",

    "when extending @xmath150 to @xmath12 , we shall further assume @xmath418 .",
    "we show that @xmath347 ( and hence @xmath6 ) is globally rigid .        to see this , let @xmath24 be the plane in @xmath29 determined by @xmath424 .",
