    "the polarization of bottom baryons @xmath0 s has been measured by aleph @xcite , opal @xcite and delphi @xcite .",
    "the aleph data showed that the @xmath0 polarization has value @xmath2 .",
    "the opal data indicated the polarization @xmath3 .",
    "the delphi experiment gave @xmath4 .",
    "although these three measurements are compatible with each other , the @xmath0 polarization still has a wide range of value from @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "to improve the situation , it is better to find out a sensitive measurable quantity on the polarization .",
    "however , this is very difficult before we can have a more qualitative understanding on the spin properties of @xmath0 baryons .",
    "this paper is intended to understand the behind mechanisms by constructing physical models based on perturbative qcd formalism .",
    "measurement of a large longitudinal polarization of the @xmath0 may indicate the polarization of primary @xmath1 quark produced from a @xmath7 decay .",
    "the @xmath1 quarks produced in the reaction @xmath8 are highly polarized with polarization @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the corrections from hard gluon emissions and mass effects can change the polarization of the final state @xmath1 quarks by only @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 quark can fragment into mesons and baryons .",
    "the decays of b mesons into spin zero pseudoscalar states do not retain any polarization information .",
    "the hadronization to @xmath1 baryons might preserve a large fraction of the initial @xmath1 quark polarization . in the heavy quark mass limit ,",
    "the spin degrees of freedom of @xmath1 quark are decoupled from a spin - zero light diquark .",
    "the initial polarization of @xmath1 quark can therefore be preserved until the @xmath0 decays .",
    "the higher mass @xmath1 baryon states can decay into the @xmath0 baryon but transfer little spin degrees of freedom .",
    "these effects have been estimated from different scenarios as about @xmath11 .",
    "this leads to that the final @xmath0 polarization could be @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the aleph collaboration measured the @xmath0 polarization by employing the method suggested by bovicini and randall @xcite . in the ratio @xmath13 with @xmath14 and",
    "@xmath15 the averaged lepton and antineutrino energies in the laboratory reference frame , the fragmentation effects are largely cancelled out .",
    "also , the spectra of the electrons and anti - neutrinos produced from the inclusive semileptonic decays of polarized @xmath0 baryons are harder relative to the spectra of unpolarized decays .",
    "the aleph collaboration proposed to measure the ratio @xmath16 , which is a lorentz invariant quantity .",
    "the @xmath0 polarization is then extracted from a comparison between the measured ratio @xmath17 and a monte carlo simulation ratio @xmath18 with varying @xmath19 .",
    "because the @xmath0 polarization is best defined in the rest frame of the @xmath0 baryons , one can rewrite the ratio @xmath20 in terms of the averaged variables in the rest frame to determine the polarization [ pr ] p=  , where the star variables denote the averaged quantities in the rest frame and are calculated with @xmath21 .",
    "the above equation can be investigated by different theoretical models .",
    "for example , if we apply the free quark model to calculate the star variables , we can obtain the polarization @xmath22 , which is closed to the aleph s result @xcite .",
    "the situation will become interesting as we apply the same model for the delphi experiment .",
    "the delphi experiment measured the same ratio @xmath23 and obtained @xmath24 . in the same way , it is easy to check that substituting delphi s ratio @xmath25 into eq .",
    "( [ pr ] ) can derive a different value @xmath26 in free quark model .",
    "on the other hand , in the same model , if we employ the opal s polarization @xmath27 into the aleph s and delphi s monte carlo simulation ratios @xmath28 , we can extract the central value of corresponding @xmath20 as @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "this seems to imply that there requires more investigations to find a consistent picture for @xmath0 polarization .",

    "it will become clear in the following sections that different models would give different values of ratio @xmath33 but almost the same @xmath34 due to the characteristics of the lepton and anti - neutrino spectra .    in order to explore the mechanisms controlling the spin properties of polarized @xmath0 baryons",
    ", we shall investigate four models .",
    "they are the ( free ) quark model ( qm ) , the modified quark model ( mqm ) , the parton model ( pm ) , and the modified parton model ( mpm ) .",
    "the parton model describes the probability of finding the @xmath1 quark carrying a momentum fraction of the momentum of the @xmath0 baryon by a parton distribution function .",
    "the quark model assumes that the @xmath0 baryon contains only one @xmath1 quark and two light quarks and the corresponding parton distribution function is just a delta function of the momentum fraction .",
    "this means that the @xmath1 quark carries almost all the @xmath0 baryon momentum .",
    "the modified quark model and the modified parton model mean that the quark model and the parton model contain additional sudakov form factor and transverse momentum .",
    "the sudakov form factor arises from a resummation over radiative corrections of soft gluons and have the effects to enhance the perturbative qcd contributions .",
    "we emphasize the importance of transverse degrees of freedom of partons inside a @xmath0 baryon in our analysis .",
    "first , the transverse momenta regularize the divergences when the outgoing @xmath35 quark in the process @xmath36 is approaching the end point .",
    "second , the transverse momenta also enhance the contributions from the spin vector along the polarization direction . for completeness",
    ", we also introduce the intrinsic transverse momentum for the distribution function .",
    "we assume that the form of the intrinsic transverse momentum part of the parton distribution function can be parameterized as @xmath37}$ ] with an impact parameter @xmath1 , which is the conjugate variable of the transverse momentum .",
    "the other factors are the @xmath0 baryon mass @xmath38 and a dimensionless parameter @xmath39 .",
    "the impact parameter @xmath1 will be integrated out in our pqcd formalism .",
    "the @xmath31 variables are functions of @xmath39 . to determine the parameter @xmath39 we rely on the experiments .",

    "however , it requires to consider the collinear divergences due to our ignorance of the charm quark mass .",
    "the jet function is then necessary for absorbing the collinear divergences .",
    "the universal soft function involves the @xmath1 quark matrix element .",
    "the matrix element contains a large scale factor , the @xmath1 quark mass @xmath46 . to have a well established matrix element",
