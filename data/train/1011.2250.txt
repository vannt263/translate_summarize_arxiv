    "strong correlations among the electrons and orbital degeneracy both play a major role in the low temperature physics of transition metal compounds @xcite . materials within this class range from the recently discovered superconducting iron pnictides to the manganites showing the colossal magnetoresistance .    due to the short spatial extension of the 3d - orbitals in the transition metal atoms and the typical crystal structure of these compounds , screening of the coulomb interaction can be considered weak , leading to the above mentioned strong local electron - electron interactions . within the group of transition metal compounds ,",
    "the cubic perovskite structure is a particularly common one . in this structure",
    "the 5-fold degenerate d - orbitals split into three - fold degenerate @xmath0-orbitals and two - fold degenerate @xmath1-orbitals .",
    "therefore , besides strong correlations also orbital degeneracy will play an important role in these compounds .",
    "especially near integer filling , orbital degeneracy can induce long - range orbital order @xcite , for which the expectation value to find an electron in one orbital depends on the lattice site and the orbital .",
    "it can be accompanied by a lattice distortion , jahn - teller distortion , caused by the coupling between electrons and the lattice @xcite . however , even without such a lattice distortion it can be energetically favorable to form an orbitally ordered state @xcite .",
    "although the perovskite crystal structure is comparatively simple , a full investigation of material - specific properties is still a big challenge . on the other hand , as a rather large number of different compounds",
    "do show qualitatively similar physics , it is suggestive to understand these common aspects by studying a model concentrating on the most important ingredients of the 3d transition metal perovskites . as has been discussed by a variety of authors ,",
    "such a model is the multi - orbital hubbard hamiltonian @xcite , which will therefore build the basis of our investigations . in this article",
    "we especially want to focus on the interplay between orbital degeneracy and strong correlations leading to either a competition or cooperation between long - range ordered phases of spin , orbital and charge degrees of freedom . particularly interesting for manganites",
    "is the case of a twofold degenerate d - band at the fermi energy , and here the special point of quarter filling seems to play a major role for the physics of this class of compounds .",
    "therefore , our aim is to study the physics of the two - orbital hubbard hamiltonian at quarter filling , with special emphasis laid on the phase diagram for the magnetic and the orbital order , and the changes in various physical quantities across the phase boundaries .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "after this introduction we will specify the model , shortly explain the used methods , and give a short overview about the ground state properties at quarter filling .",
    "thereafter we will study the influence of temperature and of magnetic fields on the ordered phases . as a particularly interesting quantity with respect to experiment we will also present results for the conductivity and its changes across the phase boundaries .",
    "a summary will conclude the paper .",
    "as already noted in the introduction , a reasonable qualitative description of the low - energy properties of 3d - transition metal perovskites can be obtained by the multi - orbital hubbard model @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 creates an electron at site @xmath4 , with spin @xmath5 in orbital @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath7 is the density operator and @xmath8 is the spin operator for the electrons .",
    "@xmath9 corresponds to a hopping of the electrons between nearest neighbor sites and @xmath10 represents a pure local two - particle interaction .",
    "the interaction consists of an intra - orbital density - density interaction @xmath11 , an inter - orbital density - density interaction @xmath12 , as well as a ferromagnetic hund s coupling between the orbitals , @xmath13 .",
    "we here neglect the pair - hopping term in the hamiltonian , which should have only minor quantitative and no qualitative influence as we perform calculations for strong repulsive @xmath11 and away from half filling .",
    "nevertheless , it should be stated that there is no rotational orbital symmetry due to the exclusion of the pair - hopping term . however , due to this approximation , it is possible to include the orbital occupation as conserved quantum number into the calculations , which considerably simplifies and speeds up the numerical calculations . to check the validity of this approximation",
    ", we have performed a few additional calculations including the pair - hopping term , but no significant differences have been found .",
    "although including only local interactions and nearest neighbor hopping terms , the hubbard model is very challenging . for calculating the magnetic and orbital phase diagrams , we use the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) @xcite . capturing the local physics correctly ,",
    "it has proved to be a very powerful instrument for analyzing and understanding strong correlation effects . moreover , although for long - range order it is closely connected to standard mean field theory , the inclusion of local dynamical properties significantly renormalizes the physical properties , and even completely suppresses ordering where static mean field approaches would predict some . therefore , even if we can not account for spatial fluctuations properly , the dmft results will give a reasonable qualitative and thermodynamically consistent account of possible phases and becomes exact in the limit of infinite spatial dimensions . as we are in this study interested in the fundamental aspects of the interplay between orbital degeneracy and strong correlations , dmft is well suited . for a realistic comparison to transition metal oxides ,",
    "e.g. manganites , the lattice structure and also phonon modes should be taken into account .",
    "the remaining obstacle is to solve the dmft self - consistency equations , which are tantamount to calculate spectral functions for a multi - orbital single impurity anderson model @xcite .",
    "as we want to concentrate on @xmath1-type systems with a two - fold degenerate ground state multiplet , we can employ the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) @xcite , which is able to reliably calculate spectral functions at low and zero temperature also including spin- and orbital - symmetry - broken states . to be able to calculate spectral functions at arbitrary temperatures within nrg",
    ", we use the complete fock space algorithm @xcite .",
    "an important aspect of the dmft is that the lattice structure enters only through the non - interacting density of states ( dos ) .",
    "furthermore , apart from quantitative details , the basic physical properties are rather insensitive to the actual form of the dos , as long as particle - hole symmetry holds . as we are interested in qualitative aspects of the physics of the two - orbital hubbard model , we therefore have a certain freedom to choose a numerically convenient dos .",
    "we thus choose a semi - elliptic local density of states with bandwidth @xmath14 for the non - interacting system .",
    "for the nrg calculations we use @xmath15 to @xmath16 states kept per nrg iteration and an nrg discretization parameter @xmath17 .",
    "@xcite throughout this article the local hubbard interaction is set to @xmath18 , which is a reasonable value for transition metal oxides .",
    "ferromagnetism and orbital order in a multi - orbital hubbard model in infinite dimensions was analyzed by other authors before @xcite .",
    "however , up to now the connection between the itinerant ferromagnetic phase , most pronounced for a filling @xmath19 , and the orbitally ordered ferromagnetic phase at quarter filling was not sufficiently analyzed .",
    "the ground state phase diagram of the two - orbital hubbard model was recently analyzed in some detail by @xcite .",
    "in particular , for quarter filling the schematic phase diagram shown in fig . [ groundstate_quarter ] was obtained . in this figure both interaction parameters @xmath20 and the hund s coupling @xmath21 are treated as independent parameters .",

    ", there appears an antiferro - orbitally ordered phase without spin polarization : like for the nel state of the antiferromagnet , the lattice exhibits a bipartite ab - structure , where electrons on the a - sites of the lattice only occupy the orbital @xmath23 , while on the b - sites of the lattice they only occupy the orbital @xmath24 . if , on the other hand , @xmath25 is kept small and the hund s coupling @xmath21 is increased , one encounters for @xmath26 a homogeneous ferromagnetic phase without orbital polarization .",
    "this ferromagnetic phase extends to a filling of approximately @xmath27.@xcite the bulk part of the phase diagram at quarter filling with @xmath28 and @xmath29 is , however , an anti - ferro orbitally ordered , ferromagnetic state .",
    "thus , both types of order are quite obviously supporting each other .",
    "we should note here that for attractive inter - orbital interaction @xmath30 the energetically lowest state is a charge - density wave @xcite , which was however excluded in the phase - diagram fig .",
    "[ groundstate_quarter ] . while the orbitally ordered state at @xmath31 always results in an insulating state , the homogeneous ferromagnetic state and the paramagnetic state both are metallic .",
    "we thus encounter a metal insulator transition ( mit ) at @xmath31 when changing the interaction parameters .",
    "it is well known that strong correlations tend to localize electrons at integer fillings @xcite and that the transition point in the two - orbital hubbard model depends on the strength of the hund s coupling @xmath21 .",
    "@xcite furthermore , the localized electrons in the insulating region tend to form long range order . at quarter filling for the two - orbital hubbard model on a bipartite lattice , this can be most efficiently be done by forming an orbital ordered ferromagnetic state , thus decreasing the energy of the system .",
    "comparing to paramagnetic results , the paramagnetic mit occurs approximately at the same value of hund s coupling as this ferromagnetic mit .",
    "however , the temperature scale of the paramagnetic mit will be smaller , i.e. the paramagnetic mit will be covered by ferromagnetic states having the lower energy for a bipartite lattice .    if this mit will be observable in experiments",
    "is at least doubtful for two reasons .",
    "firstly , it is not clear how one can experimentally change the inter - orbital interactions @xmath21 and @xmath20 without also significantly changing the hubbard interaction @xmath11 .",
    "secondly , the neglected coupling to the lattice , which enhances the tendency towards orbital order due to jahn - teller - distortions , will quite likely cover this purely electronic effect . nevertheless , it is important to realize that orbital order can be stabilized without resorting to lattice degrees of freedom by correlation effects only .",

    "<S> we focus on the quarter filled system , which is a special point in the phase diagram due to orbital degeneracy . at this particular filling the model exhibits two different long - range order mechanisms , namely orbital order and ferromagnetism </S>",
    "<S> . both can cooperate but do not rely on each other s presence , creating a rich phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> particularly , in the vicinity of the phase transition to an orbitally ordered ferromagnetic state , we observe a strong magnetoresistance effect . </S>",
    "<S> besides the low temperature phase transitions , we also observe a crossover between a paramagnetic insulating and a paramagnetic metallic state for increasing hund s coupling at high temperatures . </S>"
