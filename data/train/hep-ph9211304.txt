    "effective low energy hamiltonians for non  leptonic weak decays of hadrons are usually written as linear combinations of four  quark operators .",

    "the size of these coefficients depends on @xmath7 through the qcd effective coupling constant and on the anomalous dimensions of the operators in question . since the operators generally mix under renormalization , one deals with anomalous dimension matrices rather than with single anomalous dimensions .",
    "in the case of the @xmath2 hamiltonian , relevant for instance for the @xmath8 rule and the ratio @xmath9 , there are ten operators @xmath10 which have to be considered .",
    "consequently one deals with a @xmath11 anomalous dimension matrix .",
    "the ten operators in question can be divided into three classes :    * current  current operators @xmath12 originating in the usual w  exchange and subsequent qcd corrections , * qcd penguin operators @xmath13 originating in qcd penguin diagrams , and * electroweak penguin operators @xmath14 originating in the photon penguin diagrams .",

    "because of the presence of electroweak penguin operators a consistent analysis must involve anomalous dimensions resulting from both strong and electromagnetic interactions . working to first order in @xmath15 but to all orders in @xmath16 the following anomalous dimension matrix is needed for the leading and next  to  leading logarithmic approximation for the wilson coefficient functions , @xmath17    in the leading logarithmic approximation only the one  loop matrices @xmath18 and @xmath19 have to be considered .",
    "inclusion of next  to  leading corrections requires the evaluation of the two  loop matrices @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "in addition some one  loop finite terms are needed .",
    "what is known in the literature are the matrices @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xcite@xcite and a @xmath22 submatrix of @xmath20 involving the current  current operators @xmath23 and @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present and a subsequent paper is to complete the evaluation of the matrix @xmath20 and to calculate @xmath21 .",
    "together with certain one  loop finite terms this will allow the extension of the phenomenology of non ",
    "leptonic @xmath2 transitions beyond leading logarithms .",

    "it is known for instance on the basis of ref .",
    "@xcite , that the @xmath29 submatrix of @xmath20 involving @xmath30 and @xmath24 calculated in the ndr scheme ( naive dimensional regularization with anticommuting @xmath5 ) differs substantially from the one obtained in the hv scheme ( non anticommuting @xmath5 @xcite ) .",
    "the same feature is found for the full matrices @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the important point is that the difference between @xmath31 calculated in two different schemes is on general grounds entirely given in terms of @xmath32 and the finite parts of one  loop diagrams calculated in the two schemes in question .",
    "this relation is very useful for checking the compatibility of two  loop calculations performed in different renormalization schemes and plays an important role in demonstrating the scheme independence of physical quantities .",
    "it is given in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.12 ] ) .",
    "another subtle point is the dependence of the two  loop anomalous dimensions obtained in the ndr scheme on whether a given operator has been put in colour singlet or colour non  singlet form such as @xmath33 in @xmath34 dimensions @xmath24 and @xmath35 would be equivalent by means of fierz transformation .",
    "their one  loop anomalous dimensions are the same .    again",
    "the two  loop anomalous dimensions for these two forms of operators can on general grounds be related to each other by calculating one  loop diagrams .",
    "this feature turns out to be fortunate in that it offers one way to deal with dangerous closed fermion loops involving odd numbers of @xmath5 in two",
    " loop diagrams .",
    "the latter are known to be ambiguous in the case of the ndr scheme . indeed , as we will demonstrate explicitly in section  5 and in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is possible by using different forms of the operators and the relation mentioned above , to express all diagrams with closed fermion loops in terms of diagrams not containing such loops . in this way , consistent calculations of @xmath20 and @xmath21 can be performed in the ndr scheme and compared with the one obtained in the hv scheme , free of @xmath5 problems .",
    "the following sections constitute the calculation of @xmath20 and a detailed discussion of the subtle points mentioned above . in ref .",

    "section 7 contains a brief summary of our paper . in appendices a and b explicit expressions for the elements of the @xmath0 matrices @xmath18 and @xmath20 for an arbitrary number of colours ( @xmath26 ) and flavours ( @xmath36 ) are given . in appendix",
    "c the corresponding results for @xmath20 in the case of @xmath37 are presented .",
