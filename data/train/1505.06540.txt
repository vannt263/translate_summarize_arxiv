    "in this paper , letting @xmath6 be a bounded smooth domain , we consider the stokes equations subject to the non - homogeneous slip boundary condition as follows : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the velocity and pressure of the fluid respectively , and @xmath10 is a viscosity constant .",
    "moreover , @xmath11 represents the given body force , @xmath12 the prescribed outgoing flow on the boundary @xmath13 , and @xmath14 the prescribed traction vector on @xmath15 in the tangential direction , with @xmath16 being the cauchy stress tensor associated with the fluid . the outer unit normal to the boundary @xmath15",
    "is denoted by @xmath17 . the first term in ( [ eq : stokes slip bc])@xmath18 is added in order to ensure coercivity of the problem without taking into account rigid body movements .",
    "we impose the compatibility condition between ( [ eq : stokes slip bc])@xmath19 and ( [ eq : stokes slip bc])@xmath20 which reads @xmath21    the slip boundary condition ( [ eq : stokes slip bc])@xmath20([eq : stokes slip bc])@xmath22 ( or its variant the navier boundary condition ) is now widely accepted as one of the standard boundary conditions for the navier - stokes equations .",
    "there are many applications of the slip boundary conditions to real flow problems ; here we only mention the coating problem @xcite and boundary conditions of high reynolds number flow @xcite . for more details on the application side of slip - type boundary conditions , we refer to stokes and carey @xcite and references therein ; see also john @xcite for generalization combined with leak - type boundary conditions .    in the present paper ,",
    "our motivation to consider problem ( [ eq : stokes slip bc ] ) consists in dealing with some mathematical difficulties which are specific to its finite element approximation . as shown by solonnikov and adilov in @xcite",
    "( see also beiro da veiga @xcite for a generalized non - homogeneous problem ) , proving the existence , uniqueness , and regularity of a solution of ( [ eq : stokes slip bc ] ) does not reveal essentially more difficulty compared with the case of dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "then one is led to hope that its finite element approximation could also be treated analogously to the dirichlet case .",
    "however , it is known that a naive discretization of ( [ eq : stokes slip bc ] ) , especially when a smoothly curved domain @xmath23 is approximated by a polyhedral domain @xmath24 , leads to a variational crime in which we no longer obtain convergence of approximate solutions .",
    "let us describe this phenomenon assuming @xmath25 and considering piecewise linear approximation of velocity .",
    "in view of the weak formulation of the continuous problem , see ( [ eq : weak form with constraint ] ) below , a natural choice of the space to approximate velocity would be ( we adopt the notation of section [ sec : finite element approximation ] ) : @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the outer unit normal associated to @xmath28 .",
    "now suppose that @xmath29 and that any two adjacent edges that constitute @xmath28 are not parallel .",
    "then , one readily sees that @xmath30 above reduces to @xmath31 . as a result",
    ", the finite element solution computed using @xmath30 is nothing but the one satisfying the dirichlet boundary condition , which completely fails to approximate the slip boundary condition . for @xmath32 or quadratic approximation ( or whatever else )",
    ", we may well expect similar undesirable reduction in the degrees of freedom that should have been left for the velocity components , which accounts for the variational crime .",
    "one way to overcome the variational crime is to replace the constraint in ( [ eq : vhn ] ) by @xmath33 for each boundary node @xmath34 .",
    "this strategy was employed by tabata and suzuki @xcite where @xmath23 is a spherical shell ; see also tabata @xcite .",
    "extension of the idea to the quadratic approximation was proposed by bnsch and deckelnick in @xcite using some abstract transformation @xmath35 introduced by lenoir @xcite . for @xmath23 of general shape , the exact values for @xmath36 or @xmath37 may not be available . in this regard",
    ", some average of @xmath27 s near the boundary node @xmath34 can be used as approximation of those unavailable values",
    ". this idea was numerically tested by bnsch and hhn in @xcite for @xmath32 and by dione , tibirna and urquiza @xcite for @xmath29 ( with penalty formulation ) , showing good convergence property .",
    "however , rigorous and systematic evaluation of those approximations is non - trivial and does not seem to be known in the literature . moreover , implementation of constraints like @xmath33 in a real finite element code is also non - trivial and requires special computational techniques ( see e.g.  gresho and sani @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5 ) ) , which are not necessary to treat the dirichlet boundary condition .    in view of these situations , in the present paper",
    "we would like to investigate a finite element scheme to ( [ eq : stokes slip bc ] ) such that : 1 ) rigorous error analysis can be performed ; 2 ) numerical implementation is as easy as for the dirichlet case . with this aim",
    "we adopt a _ penalty approach _ proposed by dione and urquiza @xcite ( see also @xcite ) which , in the continuous setting , replaces the dirichlet condition ( [ eq : stokes slip bc])@xmath20 by the robin - type one involving a very small number ( called the penalty parameter ) @xmath38 , i.e. , @xmath39 on @xmath15 . at the weak formulation level , this amounts to removing the constraint @xmath40 from the test function space and introducing a penalty term @xmath41 in the weak form .",
    "our scheme transfers this procedure to the discrete setting given on @xmath24 ; see ( [ eq : discrete problem with 2 variables ] ) below . since the test function space for velocity is taken as the whole @xmath42 involving no constraints , this scheme facilitates implementation , which serves purpose 2 ) mentioned above .",
    "it is indeed simple enough to be implemented by well - known finite element libraries such as ` freefem++ ` @xcite and ` fenics ` @xcite , as is presented in our numerical examples .",
    "let us turn our attention to the error analysis .",
    "the first error estimate was given by verfrth @xcite who derived @xmath43 in the energy norm for @xmath44 .",
    "the same author proposed the lagrange multiplier approach in @xcite for @xmath45 .",
    "later , knobloch @xcite derived optimal error estimates ( namely , @xmath46 for linear - type approximation and @xmath47 for quadratic - type approximation ) for @xmath25 and for various combinations of finite elements satisfying the lbb condition , assuming the existence of better approximation of @xmath17 than @xmath27 .",
    "the convergence ( without rate ) under minimal regularity assumptions was proved by the same author in @xcite .",
    "a different proof of @xmath47-estimate for the p2/p1 element was given by @xcite for @xmath44 , assuming that @xmath48 is known .",
    "the technique using @xmath49 was then exploited to study the penalty scheme in @xcite , again for the p2/p1 element and for @xmath44 .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study the penalty scheme for the p1/p1 element combined with pressure stabilization and also for the p1b / p1 element .",
    "our method to establish the error estimate is quite different from those of the preceding works mentioned above .",
    "first , we address the non - homogeneous boundary conditions ( [ eq : stokes slip bc])@xmath20([eq : stokes slip bc])@xmath22 which were not considered previously .",
    "second , concerning the penalty scheme , we directly compare @xmath50 and @xmath51 , whereas dione and urquiza @xcite introduced a penalized problem in the continuous setting , dividing the error estimates into two stages .",
    "third , we define our error ( for velocity ) to be @xmath52 , where @xmath53 may be arbitrary smooth extension of @xmath54 .",
    "this differs from @xcite and @xcite in which the errors were defined as @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively . in view of practical computation ,",
    "our choice of the error fits what is usually done in the numerical verification of convergence when @xmath57 .",
    "compared with the method of knobloch @xcite who also employed @xmath52 as the error , the difference lies in the way the boundary element face @xmath58 on @xmath28 is mapped to a part of @xmath15 .",
    "in fact , he exploited the orthogonal projection from @xmath15 to @xmath28 , the image of which is localized to each @xmath58 .",
    "then he needed delicate arguments ( see @xcite ) to take into account the fact that it is not globally injective when @xmath32 ( this point seems to be overlooked in @xcite ) .",
    "we , to the contrary , rely on the orthogonal projection @xmath59 from @xmath28 to @xmath15 , which is globally bijective regardless of the space dimension @xmath60 , provided the mesh size @xmath3 is sufficiently small .",
    "this enables us to transfer the triangulation of @xmath28 to that on @xmath15 in a natural way , which is convenient to estimate surface integrals .",
    "complete proofs of the facts regarding @xmath59 used in this paper , which we could not find in the literature , are provided in appendices [ sec : transformation between gamma and gammah ] and [ sec : error of n and nh ] .    finally , we comment on the rate of convergence @xmath43 we obtain in our main result ( theorem [ thm : error estimate ] ) which is not optimal . in our opinion , all the error estimates reported in the preceding works , which use @xmath27 to approximate @xmath17 , remain @xmath43 .",
    "verfrth ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 5.1 ) claimed @xmath46 ; however , the estimate @xmath61 which was used to derive equation ( 5.12 ) there , seems non - trivial because @xmath27 is not smooth enough globally on @xmath28 ( e.g.  it does not belong to @xmath62 ) .",
    "if @xmath63 on the right - hand side is replaced by @xmath64 , then one ends up with @xmath43 in the final estimate .",
    "dione and urquiza ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4 ) claimed @xmath65 ; however , in equation ( 4.13 ) there , they did not consider the contribution @xmath66 which should appear inside the infimum over @xmath67 even when @xmath68 ( see proposition 4.2 of layton @xcite ) .",
    "if this contribution is taken into account , one obtains @xmath43 for the final result .    to overcome the sub - optimality , in section [ sec : reduced - order integration ] we investigate the penalty scheme in which reduced - order numerical integration is applied to the penalty term .",
    "this method was proposed in @xcite and was shown to be efficient by numerical experiments for @xmath29 .",
    "we give a rigorous justification for this observation in the sense that the error estimate improves to @xmath46 if @xmath69 .",
    "our numerical example shows that the reduced - order numerical integration gives better results also for @xmath32 , although this is not proved rigorously .",
    "in our numerical results presented in section [ sec : numerical examples ] , we not only provide numerical verification of convergence but also discuss how the penalty parameter @xmath4 affects the performance of linear solvers .",
    "we find that too small @xmath4 can lead to non - convergence of iterative methods such as gmres , whereas sparse direct solvers such as umfpack always manage to solve the linear system .",

    "one sees that @xmath17 and @xmath27 are represented as @xmath530 a direct computation gives @xmath531 this combined with the observation that @xmath532 proves ( [ eq : error between n and nh ] ) . when @xmath29 and @xmath449 , by using taylor expansion , we find that @xmath285 is a point of super - convergence such that @xmath533",

    "in the case @xmath32 , it is known that the barycenter of a triangle is not a point of super - convergence for the derivative of linear interpolations ; see @xcite .",
    "for this reason , ( [ eq : error between n and nh , 2d ] ) holds only for @xmath29 .",
