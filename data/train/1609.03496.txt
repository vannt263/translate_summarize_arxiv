    "many processes in chemistry and biology involve catalysis by transition metal centers . these include systems ranging from ubiquitous catalysts of organic synthesis to the active sites of most enzymes .",
    "unfortunately , the electronic structure of such systems is often _ strongly correlated _ , which makes the theoretical study of their nature and reactivity difficult .",
    "strong correlation is characterized by the necessity of considering more than one slater determinant to describe the electronic wavefunction _ even qualitatively_. this property renders standard methods like kohn - sham density functional theory ( dft ) or single - reference wave function methods like mp2 or ccsd(t ) unreliable , if not straight out inapplicable . to describe such systems , multi - reference ( mr ) methods",
    "are needed . however , currently available mr methods still have various defects , which frequently force researchers into uneasy compromises regarding active space size , quantitative accuracy , reliability , intruder states , or the need to strongly truncate the studied system to make computational expense manageable . we here present new variants of multi - reference linearized coupled cluster ( mrlcc2)@xcite and @xmath1-electron valence perturbation theory ( nevpt2),@xcite which greatly alleviate these problems . by judiciously combining internal contraction ( ic)@xcite and matrix product state perturbation theory ( mpspt),@xcite we arrive at mr methods capable of efficiently and accurately describing large and complex strongly correlated systems",
    "_ quantitatively _",
    "( i.e. , including dynamic correlation , _ vide infra _ ) if combined with a suitable active space treatment , such as provided by dmrg reference functions .    to quantitatively describe a strongly correlated system , both dynamic correlation and static correlation",
    "must be accounted for .",
    "however , both problems have rather different demands on the wave function ansatz . to account for static correlation",
    ", a wave function ansatz needs high flexibility in many - body configuration space , but only low flexibility in one particle space  a small number of active orbitals is normally sufficient .",
    "this problem is commonly treated with brute force full configuration interaction ( fci),@xcite which is practical for up to approximately 16 active orbitals .",
    "however , recently significant progress has been made with alternative methods to fci ; in particular , due to developments in the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) algorithm , fci quantum monte carlo ( fciqmc),@xcite and selected configuration interaction approaches@xcite , static correlation can now be treated accurately in much larger active spaces .",
    "we here focus on dmrg,@xcite a variational method which minimizes the energy of a wavefunction parametrized as a matrix product state ( mps).@xcite dmrg can handle active spaces of around 3040 orbitals , and in some cases even up to 100@xcite . however , by themselves the mentioned methods are not efficient for obtaining quantitative accuracy and for this dynamic correlation must also be calculated .    to account for dynamic correlation ,",
    "a wave function ansatz capable of efficiently handling a _ large _ set of ( virtual ) orbitals is required , while the effective many - body structure of the wave function can be comparatively simple and is amendable to convenient parameterization .",
    "an efficient approach for this is to treat excitations out of a qualitatively correct , strongly correlated reference function .",
    "methods of this class are hierarchies based on truncated multireference configuration interaction ( mrci)@xcite , various flavors of perturbation theory@xcite and coupled cluster theory.@xcite however , the established methods of these classes are based on ci treatments of the static correlation , which either makes them cumbersome to apply ( ras , gas)@xcite , or limits them to small active spaces ( cas ) .",
    "some alternative approaches fall outside this static - dynamic partitioning framework ( e.g. , methods based on geminals@xcite , jastrow factors@xcite or reduced density matrices@xcite ) ; while promising , they have so far not matured into routinely applied methods .",
    "for these reasons , a major challenge in recent years has been finding ways of combining the powerful dmrg approach to static correlation with one of the techniques more suitable for dynamic correlation ( sec .",
    "[ sec : previouswork ] ) .",
    "it was only recently realized that second - order perturbation theories ( pt2s ) can be formulated with matrix product states ( mps ) by recasting them into an effective optimization problem.@xcite this approach , called matrix product state perturbation theory ( mpspt ) , converges to the fully uncontracted version of a pt2 , and can be performed with relatively minor modifications to an existing dmrg program.@xcite mpspt can treat complex zeroth order hamiltonians @xmath2 involving two - body interactions ; this allows formulating pt2 methods which are much more accurate than one - body-@xmath2-based pt2s such as mp2 or caspt2 .",
    "we recently introduced multi - reference linearized coupled cluster ( mrlcc ) as one such method.@xcite while formally a pt , the third order mrlcc3 was shown to be extremely accurate ( comparable to mrci+q ) , stable with no intruder state problems , exactly size - consistent , and to a large extent able to compensate for sub - optimal reference states.@xcite    however , the previous implementation of mrlcc is computationally still rather expensive ; this is a result of parameterizing the perturbed state using an mps , which can not efficiently treat large virtual orbital spaces . here",
    "we solve this problem by parameterizing the perturbed wave function using a mixture of celani - werner - style partial internal contraction ( ic)@xcite and mpspt ; and limiting ourselves to calculating only the second order correction to the energies .",
    "the resulting method can effectively handle large virtual spaces , while at the same time being applicable to systems with 30 active orbitals and more . as a side product",
    ", we also obtain an efficient variant of nevpt2 , which can be applied to systems with 1000 virtual orbitals and 30 active orbitals at the same time without the need for invoking the strong - contraction approximation .",
    "the article is organized as follows : sec .",
    "[ sec : previouswork ] discusses mr methods of describing dynamic correlation , including their benefits and drawbacks , and previous work aiming to make them compatible with dmrg .",
    "[ sec : ti ] introduces the nevpt2 and mrlcc2 theories , and covers our approach to their efficient implementation with ic and mpspt .",
    "[ sec : vb ] covers accuracy tests and benchmark applications ; in particular , applications to first row dimers , cr@xmath0 , pentacene and oxo - mn(salen ) , are shown , and timing tests for mrlcc2 and nevpt2 with different active spaces and basis set sizes are presented .",
    "[ sec : c ] covers concluding remarks and outlook for future research .",
    "the naive treatment of dynamical correlation in mr problems is extremely challenging,@xcite but a major breakthrough was made with the introduction of internal contraction ( ic ) by meyer.@xcite ic , now widely used in mr theories@xcite aggressively truncates the many body basis and reduces the cost of the calculation from exponential to merely polynomial in the number of active space orbitals .",
    "the difficulty with ic is that the working equations become extremely cumbersome and can often only be derived using domain specific computer algebra systems .",
    "the working equations can be simplified by treating the active orbitals and the core orbitals on an equal footing as was done in the mrci program developed by werner - knowles ( wk scheme)@xcite . but large efficiency gains can be achieved by recognizing that density matrices should only contain active space indices .",
    "this was done in the case of caspt2 by celani and werner ( cw scheme)@xcite , and much later for mrci by shamasundar et al@xcite .",
    "the straightforward use of ic in perturbation theory or truncated configuration interaction with dmrg is complicated by the fact that fourth ( and sometimes even higher ) order reduced density matrices ( rdm ) in the active space are required .",
    "calculation and storage of such high order rdms is limited to an active space of around 25 orbitals beyond which it become prohibitively expensive@xcite . to circumvent this difficulty , some researches have resorted to approximating the higher body rdm by reconstructing its disconnected part by antisymmetric multiplication of lower body rdm and ignoring the density cumulant which is the connected part@xcite .",
    "the rdm reconstruction can be performed by setting the three body and four body cumulants to zero as was done for n - electron valence perturbation theory ( nevpt2)@xcite ; which resulted in severe numerical problems rendering the theory virtually unusable .",
    "canonical transformation ( ct ) theory@xcite also sets three and higher body cumulants to zero and is known to suffer from _ intruder _ state problems ( the ct intruder states are different than the ones in perturbation theory ) .",
    "a much milder approximation is to use the exact three body cumulants but setting the four body cumulants to zero@xcite .",
    "this increases the numerical stability considerably but artifacts still remain that have to be eliminated by using level shifts .",
    "the underlying difficulty in neglecting cumulants beyond a certain rank is that , while the cumulants decay exponentially rapidly with the rank in weak correlation , they either decay very slowly or not at all in highly multireference situations@xcite .    in this work",
    "we follow a different route , by using _ partial _ internal contraction .",
    "all terms that require 4-rdms are treated fully uncontracted , and the rest of the terms , requiring three body or lower rdms are treated using ic .",
    "this partitioning is in fact also used in the mrci of shamasundar et al.@xcite .",
    "the reason this is a practical route is as follows : all terms which are difficult to treat using ic and require 4-rdms ( ic states with three active space indices and one virtual or core index ) are relatively easily treated using uncontracted theories , because they involve only one core or virtual orbital , and are effectively singly excited states . however , if these uncontracted terms are represented using wave functions , as done in previous work,@xcite their number _ still _ increases exponentially in the number of active orbitals . for this reason , we here treat such terms with mpspt,@xcite which does not have this problem",
    "this combination of ic and mpspt is the key development of the current work , which makes efficient mrlcc2 and nevpt2 methods accessible to the large active spaces treatable with dmrg .",
    "we will now discuss its theory and implementation .",
    "the molecular orbitals are divided into three subsets : the core orbitals indexed by @xmath3 , which are always doubly occupied in the reference wavefunction @xmath4 ( casscf or cas - ci ) ; the active orbitals @xmath5 , which can have any occupancy in @xmath4 ; and the virtual orbitals @xmath6 , which are unoccupied in @xmath4 .",
    "general orbitals ( i.e. , the union of the three subsets ) are indexed by @xmath7 .",
    "we work exclusively with spin free quantities , by integrating out the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian is @xmath8 here and in the following , repeated indices imply contraction , operators are written with a hat ( e.g. @xmath9 ) and numerical tensors are written without a hat ( e.g. @xmath10 ) .",
    "@xmath11 are the one electron integrals , @xmath12 are the two electron integrals , and @xmath13 are the spin - free single- and double excitation operators , in which @xmath14 denote the spin degrees of freedom .      in the rayleigh - schroedinger perturbation theory , the zeroth order wavefunction @xmath4 must be an eigenfunction of the zeroth order hamiltonian @xmath2 .",
    "however , for a given @xmath4 , this requirement does _ not _ uniquely determine @xmath2 , and in general each viable choice of @xmath2 will lead to a different perturbation theory .",
    "for example , the casscf ( or cas - ci ) wavefunction is , at the same time , an eigenfunction of the fock operator , dyall s hamiltonian,@xcite and fink s hamiltonian;@xcite choosing these as @xmath2 leads to caspt2 theory , nevpt2 theory , and mrlcc2 theory , respectively , all of which have vastly different properties . in this work",
    "we focus on the dyall- and fink- hamiltonians , which are described below .",
    "these have previously been shown to lead to accurate multi - reference perturbation methods which do not suffer from the intruder state problems plaguing caspt2.@xcite concretely , dyall s hamiltonian@xcite is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a fock matrix .",
    "@xmath17 contains modified one body integrals , approximating the interaction with core- and active electrons as a mean - field .",
    "it is defined as @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the 1-rdm . when using casscf canonical orbitals , @xmath17 becomes diagonal , and the diagonal elements can be viewed as orbital energies . a diagonal fock matrix ( implicitly assumed in the work of angeli et al.@xcite ) simplifies nevpt2 theory . however , in the present work we avoid this assumption , and the expressions derived here are more general .",
    "fink s hamiltonian@xcite is @xmath20 where @xmath21 signifies that all terms which would change the total number of electrons in the core , active or virtual spaces are removed .",
    "an interesting property of fink s hamiltonian is that the zeroth order energy is equal to the energy of the reference wavefunction , and the first order energy is zero .",
    "this is not true in nevpt2 theory ; similarly to mller - plesset perturbation theory ( mp2 ) , in nevpt2 the reference energy is given by the sum of the zeroth and first order energies , neither of which vanish .      in perturbation theory , the first order correction ( @xmath23 ) to the reference wavefunction ( @xmath24 ) is determined by solving the linear equation @xmath25 in which @xmath26 is the perturbation , and @xmath27 is a projector . to define the representation of @xmath22 ,",
    "we first split the full @xmath1-electron fock - space into configuration spaces characterized by a unique occupation pattern @xmath28 .",
    "the three integers hereby denote the change in the _ total _ number of electrons in core ( @xmath29 ) , active ( @xmath30 ) , and virtual ( @xmath31 ) orbitals relative to @xmath32 . with a two - body perturbation @xmath33",
    ", eight such spaces can be reached by @xmath34 , and are therefore required in the expansion of @xmath22 ( eq .  ) .",
    "these spaces are listed in table  [ tab : eight ] , and their representation will be discussed next .",
    "neither dyall s nor fink s hamiltonian ( @xmath15 ) change the number of electrons in the three orbital spaces ; consequently , both are block - diagonal with respect to the eight configuration spaces . therefore eq .   can be solved in each space independently .",
    ".the eight classes of perturber states reachable by applying a two - body perturbation @xmath33 to the zeroth order state @xmath4 , and which therefore contribute to @xmath22 .",
    "the classes are formed by changing the total number of electrons in core , active , and virtual orbitals , relative to the occupation pattern of @xmath4 ( indicated by positive / negative numbers ) .",
    "column 5 and 6 denote the basis of the many - body states and the order of the active - space rdm needed , _ if _ the space were parameterized using internal contraction ( ic ) .",
    "mpspt denotes matrix product state perturbation theory . in the methods discussed here ,",
    "the contribuitions to @xmath22 within spaces i  viii can be solved for independently of each other . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the results of our calculations are presented in table  [ tab : salen ] , where it can be seen that the singlet - triplet splitting not only depends on the dynamical correlation but also depends quite sensitively on the size of the basis set .",
    "interestingly the dmrg - scf calculations with vdz basis set predicts the triplet as being more stable than the singlet by 1.1 me@xmath35 , which is in contradiction to the results obtained by stein and reiher where they obtained singlet as being more stable than the triplet by 0.6 me@xmath35 .",
    "we do nt expect our dmrg - scf calculations performed with m=2000 ( or their calculations performed with m=1000 ) to be accurate enough to resolve such small differences .",
    "further there is a strong likelihood that the ground state triplet is nearly degenerate with the first excited triplet state@xcite which can easily explain the difference in the excitation energies .",
    "the splitting calculated using dmrg - scf seems to converge with basis set when going from vtz to vqz basis set .",
    "the natural orbitals of the singlet state calculated using the vdz basis set are shown in figure  [ fig : natorbs ] . the shape and the occupancy of the natural orbitals",
    "do not change substantially when the basis set is changed , signifying that the qualitative nature of the singlet state is captured already at the vdz basis set . comparing",
    "the occupation number of the singlet and triplet natural orbitals shows that one of the electrons from the doubly occupied @xmath36 orbital in the singlet state gets excited to the @xmath37 orbital in the triplet state .",
    "this transition is in agreement with other multireference calculations .",
    "orbital gets excited to the empty @xmath37 orbital which is shown schematically with the red arrow .",
    "the occupation numbers of the @xmath36 orbital and @xmath37 orbitals change from 1.96 and 0.16 in the singlet state to 1.00 and 1.04 ( shown in red ) in the triplet state respectively.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the dynamical correlation is quite sensitive to the basis set , with vdz basis set tends to strongly stabilize the singlet state in sharp contrast to the results calculated using the vtz and vqz basis set .",
    "the agreement between the nevpt2 results with the vtz and vqz basis set is quite good and nevpt2 results at the vtz basis set are in good agreement with the mrlcc2 results with the same basis set .",
    "( we were unable to perform mrlcc2 calculations with vqz basis set because of the size of the external space . ) from our work it is clear that the difference between the energy of the singlet and triplet states is relatively small and is more or less within the error bars of the methods being used .",
    "an interesting question is that of the reaction mechanism on the different potential energy surfaces , which can be further explored by calculating the barrier heights of the transition states using mrlcc2 and nevpt2 methods ; this will be the topic of a future publication .",
    "here we have shown that celani - werner scheme of internal contraction can be used to perform nevpt2 and mrlcc2 calculations for problems where the reference wavefunction is given as an mps following a dmrg - ci or a dmrg - scf calculation .",
    "this program can be used to perform nevpt2 calculations for active spaces of 30 orbitals or more and with about 1000 virtual orbitals and mrlcc calculations with similar active spaces and about 500 virtual orbitals .",
    "this lends us the ability to calculate dynamical correlations on organometallic clusters where so far only static correlation have been calculated using dmrg@xcite .",
    "our results show that we can improve the accuracy of the mrlcc theory by calculating the third order energy corrections .",
    "the third order energies can be calculated by evaluating @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the @xmath40 perturber class of the first order state .",
    "there are eight different perturber classes and the resulting 28 different matrix elements need to be calculated to evaluate the third order energy . out of these , all the ones where both the @xmath40 and @xmath41 perturber classes are parametrized using internal contraction can be easily calculated using a maximum of 3-rdms .",
    "the matrix elements , where the @xmath40 perturber class in calculated using mpspt and the @xmath41 perturber class is calculated using internal contraction , can not be calculated in a straightforward way and will be the topic of a subsequent paper .",
    "the size of problems treatable with this method can be significantly extended by using explicit correlation ( f12 methods ) and local correlations using pair natural orbitals ( pno ) .",
    "it has already been demonstrated that by performing dmrg calculations on an effective hamiltonian obtained by canonical transcorrelation of yanai@xcite , spectroscopic accuracy can be obtained for the be@xmath0 dimer@xcite .",
    "the canonical transcorrelation method@xcite although universal ( much like torheyden s post f12 correction scheme@xcite ) , has a severe memory bottleneck and can only be used for relatively small basis sets@xcite . a more efficient route for using f12-geminals in our method",
    "will be the approach used by ten - no@xcite and later by shiozaki et al.@xcite for multireference problems .",
    "pno were used in the multireference problems for the first time by fink et al.@xcite , and after a long lull pno based methods have seen a huge revival due to work of neese et al.@xcite .",
    "our next project will aim to make use of these recent developments by extending this method by combining it with f12-methods , pnos .                                                      .",
