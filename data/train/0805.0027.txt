    "in spite of the passage of more than two centuries , the principle of the torsion pendulum still underlies the design of instruments to measure ultra - small electrical or gravitational torques .",
    "ever - improving techniques for suppressing sources of systematic error in these experiments have motivated corresponding reductions in statistical measurement error .",
    "parallel improvements in optical design and low - noise electronics have previously met this challenge , but statistical uncertainty is inevitably approaching the fundamental thermal - noise limit posed by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "further improvement in signal - to - noise ratio for ambient temperature experiments may be possible only by making optimal or nearly optimal statistical inference considerations a basis for the design of measurement protocol , data analysis , and even instrumentation hardware .    in a previous article we laid the groundwork for an approach to the optimal ( minimum variance , unbiased ) statistical estimation technique for the parameters of a damped , harmonic oscillator in the presence of thermal noise ( @xcite , hereafter paper  i ) , having found no readily accessible treatment of this problem in the literature .",
    "while that work introduces the foundation of a useful methodology , its scope is quite limited because it addresses only the case of a single linear parameter , the displacement of pendulum orientation . for a torsion pendulum under the influence of an external torque",
    ", a simple displacement parameter does not distinguish between the equilibrium displacement of a pendulum mass in the presence versus absence of an external torque , the signature of a torque `` signal '' .",
    "moreover , a real torsion fibre under load slowly unwinds , also requiring parameterization .",
    "consequently , even without including pendulum oscillations , a multi - parameter model must be employed .",
    "the purpose of this article is to extend the methodology presented in paper  i to include the optimal estimation of several linear parameters . as in the case of a single linear parameter",
    ", we note that traditional methodologies for estimating multiple parameters fail for a high-@xmath1 , long - period oscillator subject to thermodynamic fluctuations .",
    "the problem faced stems from the oscillator s response to the thermal bath ; the environment drives the oscillator with equal power at all frequencies and the oscillator response is a lorentzian which peaks sharply at the resonant frequency . just as in the single parameter case , in order to minimize the variance in the multi - parameter estimators , one must suppress the variance contribution from this resonance peak .",
    "superficially , the issues presented by the resonance peak , the recovery of a signal , and the unwinding behaviour of the torsion fibre , appear straightforward . one might consider treating the noise as white , then address each issue serially to produce a composite measurement approach .",
    "first , to remove the effects of the resonance one could use data from an integer number of oscillation periods as illustrated in paper  i. second , to break the degeneracy between the free orientation of the pendulum mass and its orientation in the presence of a source mass , one could modulate the signal .",
    "then by choosing the modulation frequency to be distinct from , but commensurate with the oscillation frequency , and also choosing the duration of the data sample to be an integer number of both oscillation and signal periods , the orthogonality of the fitted parameters over the measurement interval could be maintained .",
    "finally , in order to account for the secular unwinding behaviour of the torsion fibre one could include in the model to which the data are fit a few low - order polynomials .",
    "however , these polynomials are generally not orthogonal to the free oscillation of the pendulum . consequently , the estimating function for the signal is no longer orthogonal to the resonance peak . at this point",
    "it becomes clear that such a casual approach must give way to a proper multiple - parameter fitting scheme that filters the contribution from the resonance peak .",
    "as already mentioned , the absence from the literature of explicit techniques for optimal parameter estimation in the analysis of high-@xmath1 oscillators in experiments whose precision may approach the limitation posed by thermal noise has motivated our search for a practical solution to this problem .    to set a context for presenting the optimal solution , we discuss two , straightforward , approximate methods that suppress the contribution of the resonance peak to the variances of important model parameters .",
    "the first , which we call the trigonometric method , is to fit the data optimally for white noise while including the sine and cosine oscillation amplitude parameters of the pendulum .",
    "doing so ensures that the estimators for the remaining parameters  particularly those that correspond to relevant observables  are immune to the variance contribution from the resonance .",
    "the second method , which we call the autosum  method , is to pre - filter the data by adding a given realization of pendulum motion to itself displaced by half an oscillation period , thereby eliminating the effects of resonant oscillations to a large extent .",
    "these pre - filtered data are then fit optimally for white noise .",
    "the autosum  method was employed by the et - wash group at the university of washington in their early torsion pendulum experiments ( e.g. @xcite ) . while that group has refined this method extensively @xcite , we selected the autosum  estimation technique since it provides a simple , contrasting approach to the trigonometric estimator .",
    "we analyze these two methods as examples of how we can understand and compare their behaviours relative to the optimal estimate derived using the parameter estimation formalism introduced in paper  i and extended here .",
    "our purpose in this work is to illustrate the application of this formalism and to point out its advantages , not to critique the methods employed by others .",
    "while these two estimators generally have unequal parameter variances due to their different weighting of the data , both methods remove much of the contribution of the resonance peak to the variances because the associated filter functions , when expressed in the fourier representation , have a notch with a quadratic minimum at the resonant frequency .",
    "they also share the advantage that variances remain finite when white displacement noise is superposed on the thermal noise as is the case in any real experiment . by comparison ,",
    "the variance of the optimal thermal - noise estimators diverge when white noise is present because their displacement estimating functions include dirac delta functions ( see paper  i ) .",
    "the ubiquity of white noise motivates us to include these approximate methods in our discussion because they represent the schemes that experimentalists actually employ , and likely will continue to employ in the future .    since the optimal estimation method is pathological in the presence of white noise , comparing it with approximate methods may appear little more than an interesting exercise because an experiment can never be conducted in this idealized context",
    ". however , such results establish a firm lower bound to the variance of a parameter estimator enabling one to weigh the benefit of improving the experimental methods to lower the uncertainty in a measurement against the labor necessary to implement such modifications .",
    "moreover , asking which approximate method is superior in a real experiment brings up matters of judgment .",
    "an experimentalist must choose an analysis method and justify the choice in light of many aspects of the experiment at hand .",
    "design questions regarding the advantages of a particular length of a data sample , the most appropriate phase of the modulated signal , or the effect of adding additional parameters to the model can be answered with confidence for the case of white noise . for thermal noise , however , the answers to such questions appear unresolved in the literature . in this paper",
    "we set forth a basis for such choices .    the major premise of paper",
    "i is that transforming to the driving - force basis  where the force noise is clearly white  allows one to readily determine the optimal thermal noise filter for the purpose of estimating a single parameter from a sample of continuous data .",
    "here we extend this idea to multi - parameter models .",
    "in addition , we demonstrate a second point that was not emphasized in paper  i : this white - noise driving - force basis is more natural than the displacement basis for developing , analyzing , and comparing different parameter estimation methods  one s intuition is better served in this basis .",
    "given the insight gained by working in the driving - force basis and the tools we develop to fit multi - parameter models to continuous data , questions about the choices mentioned above can be readily answered with confidence and precision .",
    "we begin our discussion with a brief review of the notation used in paper  i. then we present a comparison of the single - period , optimal thermal - noise estimator of the equilibrium displacement ( derived in paper  i ) with a single - period boxcar estimator because the latter , a uniform average , is the foundation of the two approximate estimation methods we consider .",
    "we show in section [ transformsection ] how to transform an estimating function from its displacement - basis representation into the basis of the driving force  the inverse of the transformation presented in paper  i. we continue with a comparison of optimal , trigonometric , and autosum  single - parameter estimators of the equilibrium displacement for various durations of the data sample , and then present a method to construct ( in the driving - force basis ) an estimator that performs well in the case of a mixture of white and thermal noise .",
    "the derivation of this new estimator further demonstrates the advantage of working in the basis of the driving force .    following",
    "this derivation is a digression to develop the methods required to extend the optimal single - parameter , thermal - noise estimators to the multi - parameter case .",
    "the basic result is that optimal multi - parameter estimating functions are orthonormal linear combinations of the optimal single - parameter estimating functions derived in paper  i. we are then ready to compare the full , multi - parameter versions of the optimal , trigonometric , and autosum  methods for a modulated signal while also fitting constant and linear polynomial terms to accomodate fibre unwinding .",
    "finally , we consider a different thermal noise model that is of particular interest for torsion pendulum experiments . in",
    "moderately high vacuum torsion pendulum experiments , thermal noise results primarily from torsion fibre internal loss mechanisms . empirically ,",
    "the driving - force power spectral density in this case is better approximated by a @xmath0 spectrum rather than the white spectrum of classical dashpot resistance  @xcite .",
    "although the optimal methods we develop no longer strictly apply , we investigate how the thermal - noise optimal , trigonometric , and autosum  variances compare in the presence of @xmath0 noise ; this in addition to similar comparisons for dashpot thermal noise , white noise , and mixed white and thermal noise .",
    "we make two preliminary comments on the presentation of and approximations used in this work .",
    "first , in order to inform the reader s experimental intuition , we choose to present concrete examples based on relevant choices for sample duration , signal frequency , etc .",
    "these examples and the estimation methods that we analyze were selected solely to provide illustrations of the formalism that we develop here and in paper  i. second , because the quality factor , @xmath1 , is typically several thousand in today s torsion pendulum experiments , we simplify our calculations by truncating results to leading order in @xmath2 . as mentioned above , traditional methods of parameter inference fail for a high-@xmath1 , long period oscillator  precisely the regime where this truncation is justified . making this approximation here ,",
    "however , differs from paper  i in which some results were presented as exact , closed - form expressions .",
    "note that this work does not present the analysis of any particular experiment .",
    "rather , it presents a method by which the performance of different parameter estimators can be compared under various noise environments and it demonstrates the conceptual advantages of developing parameter estimators in the basis of the thermal driving force .",
    "as a point of departure , we first compare two estimators for the equilibrium displacement of the oscillator in the presence of thermal noise , the optimal estimator and the boxcar estimator .",
    "the latter , a simple , uniform average of the time - domain data , is optimal for the case of white displacement noise .",
    "we recall from paper  i ( eq .",
    "10 ) that a general parameter estimate for a continuous time series is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the data ( for a torsion pendulum @xmath4 is the measured angular displacement ) , and the estimating function @xmath5 is obtained by properly normalizing a filter function .",
    "we again use the convention that a capital letter ( e.g. @xmath6 ) represents an ensemble of realizations which are represented by lower case letters ( e.g. @xmath4 ) .",
    "the variance of the corresponding parameter estimator , expressed in the fourier representation ( paper  i , eq .",
    "14 ) , is @xmath7s\\left[\\delta x(t);\\nu\\right]d\\nu \\label{varequation}\\ ] ] where the fourier energy density ( fed ) @xmath8 $ ] is the square of the fourier transform of the estimating function and @xmath9 $ ] is the power spectral density ( psd ) of the noise ensemble @xmath10 .",
    "our goal is to calculate the parameter estimator variances to leading order in @xmath2 . for thermal noise",
    ", the psd already contains a factor of @xmath2 , and so we need express the estimating functions only to zeroth order in @xmath2 ( that is , we may use the estimating functions that would be suitable for an undamped oscillator ) .",
    "in paper  i we find the optimal estimate of the equilibrium displacement of the oscillator in the presence of thermal noise . to zero - order in @xmath2 , the single - period , optimal estimate is ( c.f .",
    "paper  i , eqs .",
    "7 & 44 ) @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the time - average position of the oscillator , @xmath13 is the ( undamped ) oscillation frequency , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the initial and final velocities of the oscillator .",
    "the corresponding estimating function is ( c.f .",
    "paper  i , eqs .",
    "42 & 43 ) @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the period of the pendulum , @xmath18 is the boxcar function , and @xmath19 is the time derivative of the dirac delta function .",
    "we call this estimate a `` force - only '' estimate because its estimating function is orthogonal to a free - oscillation transient of arbitrary amplitude and phase .",
    "that is , @xmath20 and @xmath21    all such force - only estimators have an estimating function that can be expressed in the driving - force basis .",
    "as shown in paper  i , the optimal displacement estimating function for thermal noise is a boxcar in the force basis ( c.f .",
    "paper  i , eq . 46 ) @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the mass of the oscillator . since thermal noise looks white in the force basis , the variance of the estimator is readily calculated in the time domain , @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath27 is the absolute temperature of the thermal bath , @xmath28 is the torsional spring constant , @xmath29 is the damping coefficient , and @xmath30 .      in our previous work",
    "we showed that an estimating function in the force basis , @xmath31 , can be transformed into the corresponding displacement basis estimating function by using the transpose equation - of - motion operator @xmath32 ( c.f .",
    "paper  i , eqs .",
    "40 & 41 ) @xmath33\\\\ & = \\left(m \\frac{d^2}{dt^2 } -\\xi \\frac{d}{dt } + \\kappa \\right ) y_{\\hat{p}}(t ) .",
    "\\label{eqofmotiontrans } \\end{split}\\ ] ] for example , in paper  i @xmath34 was derived from @xmath35 by this method . as we compare the results of various estimation techniques we wish to exploit the simplifications that follow from working in the force basis where the noise power spectrum is white .",
    "doing so requires that we obtain the force basis estimating function from the displacement basis estimating function  the inverse of what we have done before .",
    "a straightforward approach to find @xmath36 from @xmath37 is to consider the equation of motion relating the driving force to the time series @xmath38\\\\ & = \\left ( m\\frac{d^2}{dt^2}+\\xi \\frac{d}{dt } + \\kappa \\right ) x(t ) \\label{eqofmotion } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the equation of motion operator .",
    "we know from the solution to this differential equation that , to leading order in @xmath2 , @xmath40 for a high-@xmath1 oscillator the quantity @xmath41 is very small and the equation of motion operator is well approximated by its transpose , @xmath42 .",
    "substituting @xmath39 for @xmath32 in equation ( [ eqofmotiontrans ] ) one obtains the solution for @xmath36 that is similar to that in equation ( [ odesolution ] ) @xmath43 except that the boundary value terms vanish because the estimating function must be identically zero outside of the time series .",
    "it is important to note that the @xmath31 that results from this equation is valid only when @xmath5 satisfies both ( [ req1 ] ) and ( [ req2])it is force - only , sensitive to the driving force but not the free oscillation of the pendulum .",
    "let us now apply this method to a boxcar estimator ( unless otherwise noted the term `` boxcar estimator '' will hereafter refer to one constructed in the displacement basis ) .",
    "we first calculate the force basis estimating function that corresponds to the boxcar estimator to zeroth order in @xmath2 @xmath44 the variance in the corresponding parameter estimator is now @xmath45 thus , the penalty for using the boxcar estimator instead of the optimal estimator is a factor of 3/2 increase in the parameter variance .    to understand the source of this 50% penalty we consider ( [ yfrome ] ) where it follows that a force - only @xmath5 which is bounded ( that is , never infinite ) results in a @xmath31 that smoothly transitions to zero at both @xmath46 and @xmath47it is zero and has zero slope at the endpoints .",
    "the cosine term in ( [ yboxone ] ) serves to match these boundary conditions .",
    "since the cosine function is orthogonal to a constant function over one period , the amplitude of the boxcar in ( [ yboxone ] ) must be the same as in the optimal in order for the estimate to be unbiased .",
    "finally , because the average value of cosine squared is 1/2 , the variance increases by 50% .",
    "conversely , if one begins with a force - only @xmath5 that is unbounded ( e.g. has @xmath48 s or @xmath19 s at the endpoints ) , then the resulting @xmath31 has discontinuous jumps that correspond to measurements of the boundary conditions of the oscillator .",
    "the fact that the boxcar estimator does not utilize this boundary information results in its increased uncertainty in the values of the estimated parameters .",
    "the factor of 3/2 in ( [ varcboxone ] ) leads one to ask if additional data improves this result and if the variance in the boxcar estimator ultimately converges to the optimal value .",
    "it turns out that neither occurs under the approximations under consideration . yet",
    ", this optimal filter for white displacement noise can be used to construct an estimator that performs much better when thermal noise dominates . here",
    "we develop and study two estimators , the autosum  and the trigonometric estimators , both of which are based upon the boxcar estimator . following that",
    ", we compare the performance of these estimators for the cases of white noise and `` mixed noise '' , which has both thermal and white noise components . finally , we present the construction of a new estimator that performs well for cases of mixed noise .",
    "the development of this new estimator takes advantage of the intuitive relation between the performance of an estimator and its functional form in the driving - force basis .",
    "this development is facilitated by knowledge of the form of the optimal estimator .",
    "following the calculations in section [ singleperiodop ] one can show that the variance of the optimal estimator times the duration of the data , @xmath49 , is @xmath50 thus , for three periods of data , the optimal variance has decreased by a factor of 1/3 .",
    "similarly , for three periods of data the variance in the boxcar estimator has decreased by a factor of 1/3 .",
    "this pattern continues for data that span an integer multiple of oscillation periods . to leading order in @xmath2 the variance in the boxcar estimator",
    "remains a factor of 3/2 larger than the optimal .",
    "the autosum  estimator improves upon this by averaging the time series with itself displaced by 1/2 period .",
    "however , doing so requires an additional 1/2 period of raw data .",
    "the 3.5-period autosum  estimating function is    @xmath51    where the `` as '' superscript represents the `` autosum '' estimating technique . from ( [ yfrome ] ) this gives the force - basis estimating function @xmath52    the variance in the corresponding estimator is @xmath53 of optimal ( this numerical result and others from the following discussion will be represented in figure [ variancecomp1 ] ) .    to illustrate why the autosum  estimator is superior to the boxcar estimator ( @xmath53 of optimal compared with @xmath54 ) , recall that the optimal estimating function is a boxcar in the force - basis . in this basis ,",
    "the displacement - basis boxcar is a constant plus a sinusoid whereas the autosum  estimating function is simply a constant with smooth transitions to zero near the endpoints ( sinusoidal profile ) .",
    "figure [ eotwashpic ] shows the 3.5 period force - basis representation of the autosum  estimating function as the sum of its parts .",
    "when viewed in the force basis , the autosum  estimating function can be seen to be a better approximation to the optimal estimating function than is the displacement - basis boxcar .        comparing the 3-period boxcar estimator with a 3.5-period autosum",
    "estimator is not entirely a fair comparison .",
    "the variance of a 3-period autosum  estimator , which results from the sum of two mutually displaced 2.5-period boxcar estimating functions , is @xmath55 of optimal  still significantly better than the boxcar estimator .",
    "in addition , while the constituent 2.5-period boxcars are not individually orthogonal to the pendulum oscillation the 3-period autosum  estimator is . indeed , any autosum  estimator is a force - only estimator because the unique summation scheme removes the effect of the free oscillation to zero order in @xmath2 ; thus satisfying the conditions ( [ req1 ] ) and ( [ req2 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "any boxcar estimator that is a half - integer number of periods in duration will suffer a significant penalty of order @xmath1 in variance inflation because of contamination from the pendulum oscillation ( as shown in paper  i ) .",
    "if we were to use the autosum  estimator for a single period of data , then the resulting variance in the parameter estimator would be 150% of the optimal  identical to the variance for the boxcar .",
    "this can be seen the force - basis representation of this estimator shown in figure [ eotwashpic ] where , if the flat middle portion of the autosum  estimating function were to vanish , the remaining function is equivalent to the force - basis representation of the displacement - basis boxcar , a sinusoid .",
    "thus , within a few periods of data the autosum  estimator improves dramatically over the boxcar estimator .",
    "the variance in the autosum  estimator continues to converge toward the optimal estimator as the observation interval increases because the constant portion of the force - basis estimating function constitutes a larger and larger fraction of the total duration . in the force basis , the primary difference between the autosum  estimator and the optimal estimator is the smooth transition at the edges from the constant value to zero for the former as opposed to the step function transition for the latter . for thermal noise",
    ", abrupt edges characterize the optimal estimator ; however , the consequence of those edges is shown when white noise , which lacks a high - frequency cutoff , is present .",
    "we discuss the effects of these discontinuities in section [ whitenoise ] .",
    "we now turn our attention to the trigonometric approach  a different , but straightforward improvement of the boxcar estimator . the trigonometric estimator results from including the sine and cosine components of the free oscillation of the pendulum in the fit .",
    "this can be accomplished , for example , using a general form of the estimating function @xmath56 and choosing the values of @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 such that the constraints ( [ req1 ] ) and ( [ req2 ] ) are satisfied and that the normalization is correct ( as stated in equation ( 12 ) of paper  i ) .",
    "the trigonometric approach produces reasonable estimators for any duration of the sample .",
    "the 3.5-period estimating functions in the displacement and force bases are then @xmath60 and @xmath61 respectively .",
    "the variance of the 3.5-period trigonometric estimator is 118% of optimal , much better than 150% for the 3-period trigonometric estimator ( which is equivalent to the 3-period boxcar ) .",
    "not only is this estimator acceptable , but in terms of variance ( not variance times time ) the 3.5-period trigonometric estimator is better than the 4-period trigonometric ( or boxcar ) estimator .",
    "although its force - basis estimating function always contains oscillatory terms and does not , therefore , resemble the constant profile of the optimal estimating function , the half - integer period trigonometric estimator is better than its integer period counterpart because there is a triangular envelope on the sine component of the oscillation which suppresses the contribution from that term .",
    "figure [ comparison ] overlays the 3.5-period optimal , autosum , and trigonometric estimating functions . for longer observation times , the trigonometric estimator remains at 150% of optimal for integer periods and converges to @xmath62 of optimal for half - integer periods , if examined to first order in @xmath2this is unlike the autosum  estimator which converges identically to the optimal .",
    "the top panel of figure [ variancecomp1 ] compares the variances in these three estimators multiplied by the duration of the sample for 1 , 1.5 , 3 , 3.5 , 9 , and 9.5 periods of data .",
    "the motivation for using 3 and 9 periods stems from our examination ( later in the discussion ) of modulated force signals .",
    "the corresponding half - integer periods are included because the autosum  estimator uses raw data that span a half - integer number of periods .        since the variance in the autosum",
    "estimator approaches that in the optimal estimator as the duration of the data increases , a practical limit to the length of the observations is set primarily by factors that lie beyond mathematical considerations .",
    "these could include unavoidable non - gaussian disturbances that partition the realization or low - frequency noise ( drift ) .    ) ] , scaledwidth=45.0% ]      so far we have examined the effects of thermal noise alone on the variances in these estimators .",
    "a real system will always display some white displacement noise as well .",
    "for white noise the variance of a given parameter estimator is most easily obtained in the displacement basis @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the ( constant ) psd of the noise .",
    "since the displacement - basis estimating functions involve derivatives of the force - basis estimating functions ( see ( [ eqofmotiontrans ] ) ) , only those force - basis estimating functions that are smooth ( i.e. second - order differentiable ) will have a well defined variance in the presence of white displacement noise .",
    "the step - function transition exhibited by the estimating functions that are optimal for thermal noise will have dirac delta functions and their derivatives in the displacement basis .",
    "thus , the high - frequency components of white noise are infinitely amplified by those delta functions and the variances of the estimators diverge to infinity .",
    "the lower panel of figure [ variancecomp1 ] displays the variances in each of the two approximate estimators for the case of white noise . for comparison , we normalize the white noise psd so that it is equal to the zero frequency limit of the thermal noise psd .",
    "that is , @xmath65 & = s[\\delta x_{{\\text{th}}}(t);\\nu=0]\\\\ & = \\frac{4k_{{\\text{b}}}t\\xi}{\\kappa^2}\\\\ & = \\frac{4\\sigma^2}{q_0\\omega_0}. \\label{whitenormalize } \\end{split}\\ ] ] we see from figure [ variancecomp1 ] that the trigonometric approach is always superior to the autosum  approach for the case of white noise , although the difference may be small .    the optimal estimator for white displacement noise is the boxcar estimator .",
    "both the trigonometric and the autosum  estimators are equivalent to the boxcar estimator for a single period of data , as can be seen in both panels of figure [ variancecomp1 ] . for 1.5 periods ,",
    "the trigonometric estimator has smaller variance than the autosum  estimator for both noise processes .    from the calculations in this section we can do more than qualitatively",
    "compare the two approximate estimators ; we can identify the ratio of white to thermal noise where one approach becomes superior to the other .",
    "following the psd normalization in ( [ whitenormalize ] ) , we state the mixing ratios as the fraction of the total noise power contributed from a given noise process , white or thermal .",
    "table [ noisemixresults ] outlines the results of this test .",
    ".[noisemixresults]noise mixing ratios for various sample durations where the trigonometric estimators become superior to the autosum  estimators .",
    "the autosum  estimators are superior when the white noise contribution is less than the stated amount . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for a measurement scheme in which white noise dominates , the experimenter should likely consider increasing the modulation frequency closer to resonance in an effort to increase the signal - to - noise ratio ( the signal - to - noise ratio for thermal noise is independent of the modulation frequency ) . in such a situation a resonant method would be suitable . with some modification to accommodate non - linear fits ,",
    "the techniques developed in this article can be applied to resonant and other large - oscillation - amplitude detection schemes @xcite though a detailed exploration of that topic lies beyond the scope of this work .      for modern torsion balance experiments that are conducted at high vacuum , the predominant damping / noise mechanism is the fibre dissipating energy rather than residual gas in the vacuum chamber .",
    "@xcite states that for this scenario a @xmath0 profile is a better approximation to the driving - force psd than the white driving force that is characteristic of a classical dashpot ( although @xmath0 is the common term for this noise process , we use @xmath66 in our formulas in order to avoid confusion with filter functions ) .",
    "mathematically , such a spectrum is less tractable , so there is no simple method for finding the optimal estimating functions as for the oscillator with dashpot damping .    nevertheless , we can still calculate and compare the variances of our estimating functions .",
    "we compute these quantities in the driving - force basis since it is still easier than in the displacement basis , but we must now numerically integrate the product of the psd and the fed ( see ( [ varequation ] ) ) .",
    "we first note that this revised damping of the oscillator is frequency dependent with a functional form similar to that of the driving force : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the resonance frequency ( in hz ) and @xmath69 is the velocity damping coefficient that corresponds to the resonance frequency .",
    "this form constrains the observed damping at the resonance frequency to be the same for both @xmath0 thermal noise and for dashpot thermal noise .",

    "the estimating functions for @xmath73 and @xmath74 are orthogonal to the constant signal parameterized by @xmath75 , and since they are force - only estimators , it can be shown that their corresponding @xmath72 s are also orthogonal to a constant .",

    "this is largely because that noise is greater by 50% at the chosen signal frequency .",
    "we also see from figure [ oneoverffigure ] that the optimal thermal - noise estimator is slightly inferior to the autosum  estimator for some values of the sample duration  showing that the optimal thermal - noise estimator is not the true optimal estimator for @xmath0 thermal noise , as expected .",
    "however , a comparison of the results for @xmath0 thermal noise in figure [ oneoverffigure ] with the results of both dashpot thermal noise in figure [ multifigure1 ] and white displacment noise in figure [ multifigure2 ] , indicates that dashpot thermal noise is the better model to guide the development of an estimator for @xmath0 thermal noise .",
    "the topics discussed in this paper illustrate the differences between two selected parameter estimation techniques relative to the optimal technique for thermal noise dominated experiments .",
    "a major simplification in the study and application of parameter estimation for this case results from working in the basis of the thermal driving force where the psd of the noise is white .",
    "equations ( [ eqofmotiontrans ] ) and ( [ yfrome ] ) show how to transform between the displacement basis and the driving - force basis .    in the driving - force basis ,",
    "analysis practices that are commonly applied to data exhibiting white displacement noise can be utilized for estimation in the presence of thermal noise .",
    "working in that basis allows better insight to and understanding of the results from various approximate methods that experimentalists generally employ .",
    "we also showed that in the driving - force basis , one can more readily construct estimators , such as the mixed  estimator , that perform well for the case where the noise is a mixture of white and thermal .    additionally , working in the driving - force basis",
    "ensures that a parameter estimator is insensitive to the effects of the resonance peak .",
    "this feature also provides immunity to transient oscillations induced by disturbances that occur prior to the data sample , as discussed in paper  i. a further advantage , for modulated signals , is that the signal frequency does not have to be commensurate with the natural oscillation frequency .",
    "in fact , there can be two or more signal frequencies that need not be commensurate with each other .",
    "while the approach we outline may be applied generally , the interesting calculations can be truncated to leading order in @xmath2 without losing value to an experimentalist .",
    "specifically , meaningful results are obtained  and with greater facility  using the undamped approximation for the signal and estimating functions .",
    "besides making analytic calculations simpler , working in the driving - force basis makes leading - order numerical solutions more robust against artificial influence of power from the resonance peak .    for a real torsion pendulum experiment ,",
    "the superposition of several noise processes is a challenge that requires one to adopt a data analysis scheme that performs well under a variety of circumstances , while necessarily being optimal in none .",
    "we have shown that the autosum  estimation technique , formerly used by the et - wash group , is not only well behaved in the presence of white displacement noise , thermal noise , and @xmath0 noise but approaches the performance of the optimal for both white and thermal noise as the duration of the observations increase . for @xmath0 noise",
    ", the autosum  estimator also performs well relative to the other techniques studied in this paper , though the singular nature of the @xmath0 noise spectrum renders identifying its corresponding optimal estimators problematic . by using the dashpot thermal noise results as a guide",
    ", one can correctly infer that the autosum  estimator is superior to the trigonometric estimator for @xmath0 thermal noise ; whereas if one had used the white noise results as a guide , one might erroneously assume the trigonometric estimator to be superior .",
    "even with the mathematical tools developed here and in paper  i , there remain several issues that are important to a modern experimental research program that lie beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "one obvious example is our _ a priori _ assumption regarding knowledge of the oscillation frequency and quality factor of the pendulum .",
    "one would prefer to identify these quantities from the same data used to estimate the other parameters of the system  especially if the experiment uses a pendulum that undergoes large amplitude oscillations .",
    "moreover , for extension to the case of large amplitude oscillations , the nonlinear nature of both the oscillation frequency and the decay constant require an additional generalization of the techniques discussed here .",
    "this is even true of the linear signal parameters of non - resonant , higher harmonic methods , such as the treatment of the second harmonic we employ in our own experiments because signal - to - noise ratio considerations require operation with large - amplitude oscillations @xcite .",
    "we leave for further investigation the extension of techniques introduced here to the optimal estimation of multiple , nonlinear parameters and its implications for torsion pendulum experiments .",
