    "direct observations of galaxies at very high redshift can cast light on the details of structure formation and early galaxy evolution . in recent years , the most commonly observed tracer of star formation at high redshift has been the lyman break galaxy ( lbg ) population @xcite .",
    "these sources are selected photometrically based on a spectral feature interpreted as being the @xmath71215.67  lyman break .",
    "neutral hydrogen along the line of sight leads to a forest of redshifted lyman-@xmath8 absorption lines , blue continuum flux is suppressed , and a galaxy will exhibit red colours in a pair of filters bracketing the break .",
    "depending on the relative depth of the imaging in different bands the galaxy will be seen to fall in magnitude between the red and bluewards bands , or even to drop below the detection limit . as a result ,",
    "lyman break galaxies are often termed ` drops ' or ` dropouts ' and their approximate redshift is determined by the band bluewards of the break .",
    "hence ` u'- and ` g'-drops lie at @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite , ` v'- and ` r'-drops at @xmath11 @xcite and ` i'-drops at @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the use of lbg samples to study star formation at ever - increasing redshifts has recently encountered a practical barrier . at @xmath0",
    "the lyman break is redshifted to 1@xmath6 m , a spectral region with poor sensitivity in both optical ccd detectors and near - infrared instruments .",
    "photometry in the relatively broad photometric filters used longwards of 1@xmath6 m effectively smears out the signatures of sharp - sided spectral features such as the lyman break , making them difficult to distinguish from more gradual spectral features such as a balmer break or molecular absorption in low redshift sources .",
    "the small field of view , high background , low sensitivity and low multiplexing of current near - infrared spectrographs further complicate the follow - up of lyman break galaxy candidates .",
    "sensitive , wide - format near - infrared imagers and multi - object spectrographs on the largest telescopes offer potential for @xmath13 lyman break galaxy searches , identifying bright near - infrared sources that drop in the optical bands ( as discussed below in section [ sec : col_sel ] ) .",
    "such surveys require knowledge of the @xmath13 luminosity function in order to estimate the required survey depth in a given area .",
    "high contamination rates in optical - dropout samples also complicate such surveys .",
    "while the most promising candidates will always require spectroscopic follow - up , it is clearly necessary to develop strategies for minimising the number of contaminating lower redshift sources from photometry alone .",
    "an important tool for fulfilling these requirements is the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ , which images at infrared wavelengths",
    ". however the 85 cm aperture of _ spitzer _ and 1@xmath142@xmath151@xmath142 arcsecond pixels of its irac instrument lead to blending and confusion issues at faint limits ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "existing deep field surveys incorporate sensitive imaging at wavelengths from 4000  to 8@xmath6 m ( the four bands of the irac instrument ) . as a result",
    ", they can provide a first constraint on the surface density of bright galaxies at very high redshifts , and a test of the ability of _ spitzer _ to distinguish genuine @xmath17 sources from lower redshift contaminants .",
    "in this paper we present an analysis of two multiwavelength data - sets , identifying and classifying optical - dropout sources in eleven widely separated fields , averaging across cosmic variance . in section [ sec : col_sel ] we discuss the colour selection criteria which isolate high redshift galaxies .",
    "in sections [ sec : ergs ] and [ sec : goods ] we apply such criteria to the eso remote galaxy survey and the great observatories origins deep survey respectively and consider the resulting candidate sources .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : discussion ] we discuss the implications of this analysis for both the @xmath13 lyman break galaxy luminosity function and future wide - area near - infrared survey .",
    "all magnitudes in this paper ( optical and infrared ) are quoted in the ab system @xcite .",
    "we use a flat universe with @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we employ the lyman break technique , identifying sources that drop dramatically in flux between the reddest optical filter ( @xmath21-band ) and the bluest commonly used filter in the infrared ( @xmath22-band ) .",
    "this criterion is sensitive to galaxies at @xmath17 , at which redshift flux longwards of the lyman break becomes shifted beyond the optical . given that the mean transmitted flux fraction through the lyman-@xmath8 forest at @xmath12 is less than 5% @xcite and may well fall to zero between @xmath23 and @xmath24 @xcite , genuine high redshift candidates are expected to have no detectable flux in any optical band , as figure [ fig : filters ] illustrates .",
    "however , other well known populations exhibit similar colours , with relatively high number densities , rendering the search for high redshift galaxies akin to the search for a needle in a haystack .",
    "the 4000  balmer break in old galaxies at @xmath25 could potentially be mistaken for a lyman break at @xmath17 , although such galaxies are likely to be detected in sufficiently deep optical imaging .",
    "cool late - type stars , particularly class l and t dwarfs , are also optically faint , but potentially bright in the near - infrared ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in order to identify all or most interlopers we require four broadband colour selection criteria in addition to optical non - detection . these are illustrated in figures [ fig : jk_jc1 ] and [ fig : j_c1c2 ] .",
    "cuts in the @xmath26 or @xmath27 m will effectively exclude the majority of cool @xmath28 class stars which are blue in these colours . since these two colours are highly correlated , with most of the colour difference arising from @xmath26 , strictly only one is necessary .",
    "however , given the challenge of observing in the thermal infrared from the ground , it is often possible to survey large areas to deeper limits in 3.6@xmath6 m with _",
    "spitzer_/irac than in k from the ground , allowing the j-3.6@xmath6 m colour to provide stronger limits in the case of faint or undetected objects .",
    "the true utility of the infrared , however lies at longer wavelengths . as figure [ fig : j_c1c2 ] illustrates , a further requirement that sources are flat or slightly red in the _",
    "spitzer_/irac wavebands is likely to exclude some low redshift galaxies and the majority of l class stars , which separate neatly from the predicted colours of young starburst galaxies at @xmath17 .",
    "unfortunately , it is impossible to exclude some late @xmath29 and early @xmath28 class stars while allowing for photometric and intrinsic scatter in the high redshift galaxy population .",
    "a final source of contamination potentially arises from mature ( @xmath301gyr old ) , highly reddened galaxies at intermediate redshifts .",
    "such sources have been identified in deep samples selected at @xmath31 m and identified as optical dropouts and have extreme colours in both @xmath26 and @xmath32 m , as opposed to mature galaxies at high redshift ( which can have dramatic @xmath27 m colours , but have near - zero colour in @xmath26 . while it is impossible to eliminate such sources from a sample without also rejecting highly - reddened , mature galaxies ( which show a balmer break ) at @xmath33 ,",
    "any galaxies with such colours must be treated with caution .",

    "for full details of the data see and douglas et al ( 2008 ) . for the purposes of identifying optical dropouts , we required full ten band photometric coverage , yielding a total survey area of 225.1arcmin@xmath2 ( after removing regions with high background noise in the near - infrared ) .",
    "objects were selected in the @xmath22-band using the sextractor software package and their fluxes measured at the centroid of the @xmath22-band detection in each band using the idl ` aper ' routine . for initial detection",
    "we required that an area of four contiguous pixels exceeded the background by at least 1.5 standard deviations , resulting in a basic photometry catalogue highly complete for unresolved and low surface brightness sources , but also highly contaminated by spurious objects at the faint end .",
    "photometry was measured in 2@xmath44 apertures in the optical and near - infrared and in larger 4.5@xmath44 apertures in the _",
    "spitzer_/irac bands in order to optimise signal - to - noise for our unresolved sources .",
    "the astrometry in the optical images and near - infrared images was found to be precise to better than 0.1@xmath44 ( half a pixel ) and to within 0.6@xmath44 in the irac bands .",
    "we find that adding an uncertainty of 0.35@xmath44 ( half the seeing disk ) to the location of the @xmath22-band centroid for our compact , low signal - to - noise objects has the effect of introducing an additional error to the photometry with a standard deviation of 0.04 magnitudes at the faint limit of our survey .",
    "this is negligible when added in quadrature with the poisson noise and statistical uncertainty in the background at the same magnitude .",
    "a refined catalogue was constructed of objects with @xmath22-band detections ( @xmath303@xmath4 ) , but no detection at 2@xmath4 in each of the @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 bands .",
    "the @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42-band imaging was combined to create a single optical image ( reaching a limiting magnitude better than 28.5 in each field ) and a further non - detection required in this image .",
    "magnitudes were not corrected for lensing .",

    "candidate high redshift sources satisfy @xmath45 ( 3 - 4@xmath4 depending on field ) after correction for aperture losses .",
    "each candidate was inspected by eye and obvious data artifacts excluded , leaving a sample of 35 candidate sources for further inspection .    by definition",
    "our target sources may only be bright in a single band , and this measurement is therefore susceptible to spurious sources in the detection band . in order to estimate the probability that our optical - dropout sources are not merely spurious detections of peaks in the random background noise",
    ", we repeated the analysis , inverting the j - band imaging in the ergs fields and determining the number of negative noise peaks that would have been detected as objects to our limit if they were instead positive signals .",
    "after discounting obviously spurious detections ( cosmic ray subtraction residuals , regions of extended noise and depressions in the background in the wings of bright emission objects ) , we find six genuine noise peaks in the 225.1 arcmin@xmath2 survey area which would have been mistaken for dropout sources if positive .",
    "their magnitude distribution , together with that of the optical dropout candidates is shown in figure [ fig : inv_test ] . making the assumption that depressions in the background of this kind are statistically as likely as positive fluctuations which would reach the photometric catalogue",
    ", we estimate that a fraction of 17% of our candidate sample , biased towards the faint end , may be spurious detections .",
    "we note that none of the spurious detections are brighter than ` @xmath46 ' ( assuming positive flux ) and that none of them coincide with source detections in any of the other 9 bands surveyed .",

    "[ fig : inv_test],width=302 ]    given the faint limits of our data , and the relatively broad psf of the _ spitzer space telescope _ in the irac bands , we also test the probability that random apertures placed on the 3.6@xmath6 m images that form part of the ergs survey coincide with infrared - detected sources . placing 300 apertures randomly in each of the ten survey fields",

    "of the 35 dropout sources , 15 were blended at the resolution of _ spitzer_/irac and can not be studied further , consistent with the expected 13.7 confused sources given poisson noise in the small number statistics .",
    "deblending was not attempted since , at these faint magnitudes , errors in the resultant flux measurement would be dominated by uncertainty in the colour and isophotal profile of the confusing sources .",
    "the remaining 20 optical dropouts had clean infrared photometry .",
    "of these , two sources were eliminated because of their blue @xmath26 colours ( @xmath48 - 0.8 ) , and a further eight were rejected as too blue in the @xmath27 m colour ( @xmath27m@xmath49 ) .",
    "the most likely identification of these sources is that they are t - dwarf stars at moderate heliocentric distances ( see section [ sec : tdwarfs ] ) .",

    "these candidates are considered most likely to be either l - class dwarfs or old galaxies at intermediate redshift .",

    "the colours of this source are given in table [ tab : ergs_cand ] and it is shown in figure [ fig : stamps ] . the remaining source has a magnitude @xmath52 suggesting that it is statistically unlikely to be a chance detection of a spurious noise peak . while the source satisfies our formal selection criteria , its colours are close to the bluewards cut - off in @xmath50 m colour .",

    "given a spectrum flat in @xmath91 ( as appropriate for young starbursts ) , this is equivalent to two magnitudes deeper than our limit in the goods fields and the area of their survey was only 4% of that discussed here .",
    "this would imply an expected 0.5 @xmath13 galaxies meeting our deep survey criteria . while we determine an upper limit of 2 galaxies at @xmath17 in our deep survey ,",
    "our more realistic expectation is that neither is likely to lie at high redshift .",
    "the confirmation of one or zero sources would confirm that the hudf is not significantly under - abundant compared with other sightlines at the same redshift .    given the varied colour selections employed by different authors , fair comparisons are difficult .",
    "we note that we would have rejected the majority of massive @xmath92 galaxy candidates proposed in the goods - south by @xcite due to the presence of flux in the observed - frame optical or as below the reliable detection limit in the @xmath22-band .",
    "by contrast the requirement of that their candidates be fainter than @xmath93 would have excluded a number of the candidate galaxies presented here .",
    "their selection method , based on a flux - limited 3.6@xmath6 m sample , may effectively select massive galaxies at these redshifts , and yet is likely to suffer incompleteness due to both confusion and insensitivity to young , starbursts ( which are highly stochastic and dominate the number counts in high redshift lyman break galaxy samples * ? ? ?",
    "hence the optical - dropout survey presented here is complementary to other @xmath17 surveys .      in the next few years ,",
    "the ukidss ultra deep survey ( uds ) will survey an area of 0.8deg@xmath2 to @xmath94 and will incorporate a search for high redshift galaxies . our deep survey probes 12.5% of this area and find at most 2 candidates which might require spectroscopic follow - up , consistant with 16 potential @xmath13 candidates in the full volume of the uds - a feasible number given a reasonable investment of large telescope time .",
    "this modest number of galaxies is largely independent of evolution in the faint - end slope of the luminosity function , since the selection is truncated well above m*. given the @xmath1 luminosity function , perhaps seven of the candidate galaxies identified in the uds might be expected to lie at high redshift , although continued evolution in m * with increasing redshift potentially reduces this number still further .",
    "it is clear that , even with exceptionally deep auxiliary data bluewards and redwards of the selection bands , the ratio of candidates to genuine galaxies in a photometric sample is likely to be at least 2.3:1 .",
    "however , as the analysis in this paper makes clear , the number of contaminant sources in samples derived from optical / near - infrared photometry alone is likely to be much higher .",
    "depth - matched imaging in the infrared wavebands of _ spitzer_/irac are essential for reducing the number of near - infrared photometric candidates ( which in the ukidss uds could exceed a hundred ) to a more practical number for expensive follow - up observations .",
    "wide - field infrared imagers currently being commissioned , such as hawk - i on the vlt , are likely to revolutionise this field , making @xmath95 as accessible to observers as @xmath96 at the current time .",
    "however , the fundamental requirement that auxiliary observations at longer wavelengths are obtained above the atmosphere will limit their utility for high - redshift surveys after the inevitable decline of irac on the _ spitzer space telescope _ and until its eventual replacement by the _ james webb space telescope_.    one prospect for the hiatus period between these two events is to extend the lifetime of _ spitzer _ in a ` warm ' mode @xcite . while sensitivity would be lost longwards of 5microns , the two shortest _",
    "spitzer_/irac wavebands provide sufficient spectral leverage to identify the majority of potential contaminants ( @xmath3080% in this study ) , and in particular to isolate cool galactic stars from the galaxy locus .",
    "inevitably the size of the ` haystack ' will increase with the loss of the 5.8 and 8.0@xmath6 m wavebands .",
    "however , the use of a warm _ spitzer _ for surveys would provide an archive that would be of use for many years , complementing both existing and future , deep ground - based surveys .",
    "the key points presented in this paper can be summarised as follows :            \\v ) the use of deep data longward of the @xmath34-band is extremely valuable if the number of high redshift candidates from deep surveys such as ukidss uds from unmanageable to reasonable numbers for spectroscopic follow - up .",
