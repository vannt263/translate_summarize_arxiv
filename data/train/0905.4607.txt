    "a great deal of work has been done recently to embed the standard model of particle physics ( sm ) into a brane construction @xcite .",
    "this research is part of the effort , initiated in @xcite , to build a fully realistic four dimensional vacuum out of string theory .",
    "while the original models were formulated in the framework of the heterotic string , the most recent efforts were formulated for type ii strings in order to take advantage of the recent work on moduli stabilization using fluxes .",
    "such brane constructions naturally lead to extra anomalous @xmath4 s in the four dimensional low energy theory and , in turn , to the presence of possible heavy @xmath5 particles in the spectrum .",
    "these particles should be among the early findings of lhc and besides for the above cited models they are also a prediction of many other theoretical models of the unification of forces ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "it is then of some interest to know if these @xmath5 particles contribute to the cancellation of the gauge anomaly in the way predicted from string theory or not . in @xcite",
    "some of the present authors have studied a supersymmetric ( susy ) extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) in which the anomaly is cancelled _  la _ green - schwarz .",
    "the model is only string - inspired and is not the low - energy sector of some brane construction .",
    "the reason of this choice rests in our curiosity to explore the phenomenology of these models keeping a high degree of flexibility , while avoiding the intricacies and uncertainties connected with a string theory construction . for previous work along these lines we refer to @xcite . in this work",
    "we continue the analysis of the axino interactions @xcite , studying the neutralino radiative decay into the axino .",
    "the next to lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) radiative decay might be the first process where the lsp could be observed at lhc @xcite . in our model",
    "we assume the axino as the lsp and a generic mssm neutralino as the nlsp .",
    "due to the axino interaction vertices the nlsp neutralino can only decay into an axino plus either a photon or a @xmath6 or sm fermions .",
    "we compute all the amplitudes for that decays and the br for the decay of a neutralino into an axino and a photon .",
    "this is the plan of the paper : in section 2 we describe our model . in section 3 and 4",
    "we find the lsp and study the axino interactions . in section 5",
    "we compute all the decay rates under study and finally in section 6 we show the results and the related plots .",
    "section 7 is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "in this section we briefly discuss our theoretical framework .",
    "we assume an extension of the mssm with an additional abelian vector multiplet @xmath7 with arbitrary charges .",
    "the anomalies are cancelled with the green - schwarz ( gs ) mechanism and with the generalized chern - simons ( gcs ) terms .",

    "the axino soft mass term deserves some comment : from  @xcite we know that a fermionic mass term for a chiral multiplet is not allowed in presence of yukawa interactions in which this chiral multiplet is involved .",
    "but in the classical lagrangian the stckelberg multiplet can not contribute to superpotential terms given that the gauge invariance given from our u(1) symmetry ( [ u1trans ] ) requires non - holomorphicity in the chiral fields .",
    "in fact in our model both the axino and the axion couple only through gs interactions .",
    "it is worth noting that a mass term for the axion @xmath50 is instead not allowed since it transforms non trivially under the anomalous @xmath0 gauge transformation  ( [ u1trans ] ) . at first sight",
    "our lagrangian may look not the most general possible one .",
    "in particular , an explicit fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) term @xmath51 and an explicit kinetic mixing term @xmath52 could be added . for what concerns the fi term",
    ", it is well known that in certain string - inspired models ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , a one loop fi term is absent , even if @xmath53 .",
    "this is in apparent conflict with the observation @xcite that in field theory a quadratically divergent fi term is always generated at one loop .",
    "the solution to this paradox is that in the low - energy lagrangian there should be a counterterm , which compensates precisely , i.e. both the divergent and the finite part of the one loop contribution .",
    "we do not write explicitly this counterterm , since its exact expression is model and regularization dependent , but we implicitly assume that such a cancellation occurs . for what concerns the kinetic mixing term , also this arises at one loop level and @xmath54 . to simplify our computations",
    "we cancel the @xmath55 term by choosing q_q = q_l [ qqequalql ] moreover the constraint ( [ qhu ] ) implies @xmath56 , cancelling another possible source of kinetic mixing . finally , as mentioned before",
    ", we do not take into account the anomaly cancellation in the gravitational sector .",
    "assuming the conservation of r - parity the lsp is a good weak interacting massive particle ( wimp ) dark matter candidate . as in the mssm",
    "the lsp is given by a linear combination of fields in the neutralino sector .",
    "the general form of the neutralino mass matrix is given in  @xcite .",
    "written in the interaction eigenstate basis @xmath57 it is a six - by - six matrix . from the point of view of the strength of the interactions the two extra states are not on the same footing with respect to the standard ones .",
    "the axino and the extra gaugino @xmath48 dubbed primeino are in fact extremely weak interacting massive particle ( xwimp ) .",
    "thus we are interested in situations in which the extremely weak sector is decoupled from the standard one and the lsp belongs to this sector .",
    "this can be achieved at tree level with the choice ( [ qhu ] ) .",

    "it is worth noting that the d terms and kinetic mixing terms can be neglected in the tree - level computations of the eigenvalues and eigenstates .",
