    "lorentz invariance ( li ) , the fundamental symmetry of einstein s special relativity , states that physical results should not change after an experiment has been boosted or rotated . in recent years , and particularly since the publication of work on the possibility of spontaneously breaking li in bosonic string field theory @xcite , there has been considerable interest in the prospect of violating li .",
    "more recent motivations for work on lorentz non - invariance have ranged from the explicit breaking of li in the non - commutative geometries that some have proposed as descriptions of physical space - time ( see @xcite and references therein ) , and in certain supersymmetric theories considered by the string community @xcite , to the possibility of explaining puzzling cosmic ray measurements by invoking small departures from li @xcite or modifications to special relativity itself @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that anomalies in certain chiral gauge theories may be traded for violations of li and cpt @xcite .",
    "our own interest in the subject began with a recent proposal @xcite for addressing the cosmological constant problem ( i.e. , how to explain the flatness or near flatness of the universe without unnaturally fine tuning the parameters of our quantum theories ) by reviving an old idea for generating composite force - mediating particles @xcite .",
    "this sort of mechanism depends on the spontaneous breaking of li . in the following section of this paper we shall discuss this idea and address some problems related to obtaining the required li breaking in the manner that has been proposed .",
    "this leads us to investigate the question of how a reasonable quantum field theory _ might _ spontaneously break li . borrowing from some old theoretical work @xcite as well as from the recent research into color superconductivity @xcite ,",
    "we argue for the existence of theories with lorentz invariant bare lagrangians where the formation of a condensate of particles of the same fermion number is energetically favorable , leading to a non - lorentz invariant vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath1 .    this breaking of li can be thought of conceptually as the introduction of a preferred frame : the rest frame of the fermion number density .",
    "if some kind of gauge coupling were added to the theory without destroying this li breaking , the fermion number density would also be a charge density , and the preferred frame would be the rest frame of a charged background in which all processes are taking place .",
    "this allows us to make some very general remarks on the resulting li - violating phenomenology for electrodynamics and on experimental limits to our non - lorentz invariant vev .",
    "most of the work in this area , however , is left for future investigation .",
    "in 1963 , bjorken proposed a mechanism for what he called the `` dynamical generation of quantum electrodynamics '' ( qed ) @xcite .",
    "his idea was to formulate a theory which would reproduce the phenomenology of standard qed , without invoking local @xmath2 gauge invariance as an axiom .",
    "instead , bjorken proposed working with a self - interacting fermion field theory of the form @xmath3 bjorken then argued that in a theory such as that described by eq .",
    "( [ bjorken ] ) , composite `` photons '' could emerge as goldstone bosons resulting from the presence of a condensate that spontaneously broke lorentz invariance .",
    "bjorken s idea might not seem attractive today , since a theory such as eq .",
    "( [ bjorken ] ) is not renormalizable , while the work of t hooft and others has demonstrated that a locally gauge invariant theory can always be renormalized @xcite .",
    "there would not appear to be , at this stage in our understanding of fundamental physics , any compelling reason to abandon local gauge invariance as an axiom for writing down interacting quantum field theories .",
    "furthermore , the arguments for the existence of a li - breaking condensate in theories such as eq .",
    "( [ bjorken ] ) have never been solid .",
    "( for bjorken s most recent revisiting of his proposal , in the light of the theoretical developments since 1963 , see @xcite ) .    in 2002",
    "kraus and tomboulis resurrected bjorken s idea for a different purpose of greater interest to contemporary theoretical physics : solving the cosmological constant problem @xcite .",
    "they proposed what bjorken might call `` dynamical generation of linearized gravity . '' in this scenario a composite graviton would emerge as a goldstone boson from the spontaneous breaking of lorentz invariance in a theory of self - interacting fermions .",
    "being a goldstone boson , such a graviton would be forbidden from developing a potential and the existence of exact solutions with constant matter fields and a massless graviton would be assured",
    ". then it would no longer be necessary to fine - tune the cosmological constant parameter in order to obtain a flat or nearly flat spacetime , providing a possible solution to a problem that plagues all mainstream theories of quantum gravity .",
    "in @xcite , the authors consider fermions coupled to gauge bosons that have acquired masses beyond the energy scale of interest .",
    "then an effective low energy theory can be obtained by integrating out those gauge bosons .",
    "we expect to obtain an effective lagrangian of the form : @xmath4^{2n } + \\,\\ldots \\label{bothbilinears}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have explicitly written out only two of the power series in fermion bilinears that we would in general expect to get from integrating out the gauge bosons .",
    "one may then introduce an auxiliary field for each of these fermion bilinears . in this example",
    "we shall assign the label @xmath5 to the auxiliary field corresponding to @xmath6 , and the label @xmath7 to the field corresponding to @xmath8 .",
    "it is possible to write a lagrangian that involves the auxiliary fields but not their derivatives , so that the corresponding algebraic equations of motion relating each auxiliary field to its corresponding fermion bilinear make that lagrangian classically equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ bothbilinears ] ) . in this case",
    "the new lagrangian would be of the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the ellipses in eq .",
    "( [ auxiliary ] ) correspond to terms with other auxiliary fields associated with more complicated fermion bilinears that were also omitted in eq .",
    "( [ bothbilinears ] ) .",
    "we may then imagine that instead of having a single fermion species we have one very heavy fermion @xmath12 and one lighter one @xmath13 . since eq .",
    "( [ auxiliary ] ) has terms that couple both fermion species to the auxiliary fields , integrating out @xmath12 will then produce kinetic terms for @xmath5 and @xmath7 .    in the case of",
    "@xmath5 we can readily see that since it is minimally coupled to @xmath12 , the kinetic terms obtained from integrating out the latter must be gauge invariant ( provided a gauge invariant cutoff is used ) .",
    "to lowest order in derivatives of @xmath5 , we must then get the standard photon lagrangian @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 ) . since @xmath5 was also minimally coupled to @xmath13 , we then have , at low energies , something that has begun to look like qed .    if @xmath5 has a non - zero vev , li is spontaneously broken , producing three massless goldstone bosons , two of which may be interpreted as photons ( see @xcite for a discussion of how the exotic physics of the other extraneous `` photon '' can be suppressed ) . the integrating out of @xmath12 and the assumption that @xmath7 has a vev , by similar arguments ,",
    "yield a low energy approximation to linearized gravity .",
    "fermion bilinears other than those we have written out explicitly in eq .",
    "( [ bothbilinears ] ) have their own auxiliary fields with their own potentials . if those potentials do not themselves produce vev s for the auxiliary fields , then there would be no further goldstone bosons , and one would expect , on general grounds , that those extra auxiliary fields would acquire masses of the order of the energy - momentum cutoff scale for our effective field theory , making them irrelevant at low energies",
    ".    the breaking of li would be crucial for this kind of mechanism , not only because we know experimentally that photons and gravitons are massless or very nearly massless , but also because weinberg and witten have shown that a lorentz invariant theory with a lorentz invariant vacuum and a lorentz covariant energy - momentum tensor does not admit a composite graviton @xcite .",
    "let us concentrate on the simpler case of the auxiliary field @xmath5 .",
    "for the theory described by eq .",

    "( [ auxiliary ] ) we see that the condition for the lagrangians @xmath17 and @xmath18 to be classically equivalent is a differential equation for @xmath19 in terms of the coefficients @xmath20 : @xmath21 -   \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\lambda_{n } 2^{2n } a^{2n } [ v'(a^2)]^{2n}. \\label{differen}\\ ] ]    it is suggested in @xcite that for some values of @xmath22 the resulting potential @xmath19 might have a minimum away from @xmath23 , and that this would give the li - breaking vev needed .",
    "it seems to us , however , that a minimum of @xmath19 away from the origin is not the correct thing to look for in order to obtain li breaking .",
    "the lagrangian in eq .",
    "( [ auxiliary ] ) contains @xmath5 s not just in the potential but also in the `` interaction '' term @xmath24 , which is not in any sense a small perturbation as it might be , say , in qed . in other words ,",
    "the classical quantity @xmath19 is not a useful approximation to the quantum effective potential for the auxiliary field .",
    "in fact , regardless of the values of the @xmath20 , eq .",
    "( [ differen ] ) implies that @xmath25 , and also that at any point where @xmath26 the potential must be zero .",
    "therefore , the existence of a classical extremum at @xmath27 would imply that @xmath28 , and unless the potential is discontinuous somewhere , this would require that @xmath29 ( and therefore also @xmath30 ) vanish somewhere between @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and so on _ ad infinitum_. thus the potential @xmath30 can not have a classical minimum away from @xmath23 , unless the potential has poles or some other discontinuity .",
    "a similar observation applies to any fermion bilinear for which we might attempt this kind of procedure and therefore the issue arises as well when dealing with the proposal in @xcite for generating the graviton .",
    "it is not possible to sidestep this difficulty by including other auxiliary fields or other fermion bilinears , or even by imagining that we could start , instead of from eq .",
    "( [ bothbilinears ] ) , from a theory with interactions given by an arbitrary , possibly non - analytic function of the fermion bilinear @xmath33 .",
    "the problem can be traced to the fact that the equation of motion of any auxiliary field of this kind will always be of the form @xmath34    the point is that the vanishing of the first derivative of the potential or the vanishing of the auxiliary field itself will always , classically , imply that the fermion bilinear is zero .",
    "classically at least , it would seem that the extrema of the potential would correspond to the same physical state as the zeroes of the auxiliary field .",
    "the complications we have discussed that emerge when one tries to implement li breaking as proposed in @xcite do not , in retrospect , seem entirely surprising .",
    "a vev for the auxiliary field would classically imply a vev for the corresponding fermion bilinear , and therefore a trick such as rewriting a theory in a form like eq . ( [ auxiliary ] ) should not , perhaps , be expected to uncover a physically significant phenomenon such as the spontaneous breaking of li for a theory where it was not otherwise apparent that the fermion bilinear in question had a vev .",
    "let us therefore turn our attention to considering what would be required so that one might reasonably expect a fermion field theory to exhibit the kind of condensation that would give a vev to a certain fermion bilinear .",
    "if we allowed ourselves to be guided by purely classical intuition , it would seem likely that a vev for a bilinear with derivatives ( such as @xmath8 ) might require nonstandard kinetic terms in the action . whether or not this intuition is correct , we abandon consideration of such bilinears here as too complicated .",
    "the simplest fermion bilinear is , of course , @xmath35 .",
    "being a lorentz scalar , @xmath36 will not break li .",
    "this kind of vev was treated back in 1961 by nambu and jona - lasinio , who used it to spontaneously break chiral symmetry in one of the early efforts to develop a theory of the strong nuclear interactions , before the advent of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite",
    ". it might be useful to review the original work of nambu and jona - lasinio , as it may shed some light on the study of the possibility of giving vev s to other fermion bilinears that are not lorentz scalars .    in their original paper , nambu and jona - lasinio",
    "start from a self - interacting massless fermion field theory and propose that the strong interactions be mediated by pions which appear as goldstone bosons produced by the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry associated with the transformation @xmath37 .",
    "this symmetry breaking is produced by a vev for the fermion bilinear @xmath38 .",

    "instead rewrites the lagrangian as @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is a self - interaction term , either bilinear or quadratic in the fields , such that @xmath45 yields a linear equation of motion .",
    "now @xmath45 is diagonalized and @xmath46 is treated as a perturbation .    in order to determine what the form of @xmath44 is , one requires that the perturbation @xmath46 not produce any additional self - energy effects .",
    "the name `` self - consistent - field theory '' reflects the fact that in this technique @xmath42 is found by computing a self - energy via a perturbative expansion in fields that already are subject to that self - energy , and then requiring that such a perturbative expansion not yield any additional self - energy effects .",

    "this is reasonable to expect in this case because the particles have no bare mass and thus the energy cost of producing them is small .",
    "the resulting condensate would have zero net charge , as well as zero total momentum and spin .",

    ", the mass @xmath72 of the bosons should be @xmath73 . if @xmath74 then @xmath75 , which violates eq . ( [ njlcondition ] ) .",
    "therefore for chiral symmetry breaking to happen , the coupling @xmath71 should be quite large , making the renormalizable theory nonperturbative .",
    "this is acceptable because the factor of @xmath76 allows the perturbative calculations we have carried out in the effective theory eq .",
    "( [ njl ] ) .",
    "this is why the njl mechanism is modernly thought of as a model for a phenomenon of non - perturbative qcd .",
    "we have reviewed how njl formulated a model that exhibited a non - zero vev for the fermion bilinear @xmath38 .",
    "the next simplest fermion bilinear that we might consider is @xmath6 , which was the one that bjorken , kraus , and tomboulis considered when they discussed the `` dynamical generation of qed . ''",
    "this particular fermion bilinear is especially interesting because it corresponds to the @xmath2 conserved current , and also because it is the simplest bilinear with an odd number of lorentz tensor indices , so that a non - zero vev for it would break not only li but also charge ( c ) , charge - parity ( cp ) , and charge - parity - time ( cpt ) reversal invariance .",
    "c and cp may not be symmetries of the lagrangian , as indeed they are not in the standard model , but by a celebrated result cpt must be an invariance of any reasonable theory ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this invariance , however , may well be spontaneously broken , as it would be by any vev with an odd number of lorentz indices .    before proceeding",
    ", however , it may be advisable to try to develop some physical intuition about what would be required for a fermion bilinear like @xmath6 to exhibit a vev .",
    "if we choose a representation of the gamma matrix algebra and use it to write out @xmath77 for an arbitrary bispinor @xmath78 , we may check that @xmath79 for the choice of mostly negative metric @xmath80 .",
    "that is , @xmath6 is timelike .",
    "this has an intuitive explanation , based on the observation that @xmath6 is a conserved fermion - number current density .",
    "classically a charge density @xmath81 moving with a velocity @xmath82 will produce a current @xmath83 ( in units of @xmath84 ) .",
    "therefore the relativistic requirement that the charge density not move faster than the speed of light in any frame of reference implies that @xmath85 .",
    "considerations of causality make it natural to expect that something similar would be true of @xmath6 .    for any time - like lorentz vector @xmath86 it is possible to find a lorentz transformation that maps it to a vector @xmath87 with only one non - vanishing component : @xmath88 . for a constant current density @xmath89",
    ", this means that for @xmath89 to be non - zero there must be a charge density @xmath90 , which has a rest frame .",
    "therefore we only expect to see a vev for @xmath6 if our theory somehow has a vacuum with a non - zero fermion number density .",
    "the consequent spontaneous breaking of li may be seen as the introduction of a preferred reference frame : the rest frame of the vacuum charge .    in the literature of finite density quantum field theory and of color superconductivity ( see , for instance , @xcite and @xcite ) , the lagrangians discussed are explicitly non - lorentz invariant because they contain chemical potential terms of the form @xmath91 .",
    "this term appears in theories whose ground state has a non - zero fermion number because , by the pauli exclusion principle , new fermions must be added just above the fermi surface , i.e. , at energies higher than those already occupied by the pre - existing fermions , while holes ( which can be thought of as antifermions ) should be made by removing fermions at that fermi surface .",
    "the result is an energy shift that depends on the number of fermions already present and which has opposite signs for fermions and antifermions .",
    "the physical picture that emerges is now , hopefully , clearer : a theory with a vev for @xmath6 is one with a condensate that has non - zero fermion number .",
    "this means that only theories with some form of attractive interaction between particles with the same sign in fermion number may be expected to produce such a vev .",
    "the situation is closely analogous to bcs superconductivity @xcite , in which a phonon - mediated attractive interaction between electrons allows the presence of a condensate with non - zero electric charge .",
    "note that in the njl model , the condensate was composed of fermion - antifermion pairs , and therefore clearly @xmath92 , which implies @xmath93 .",
    "it should now be physically clear why a vev for @xmath6 would break not only li but also c , cp , and cpt .",
    "there is an easy way to write a theory which will have a vev for a @xmath2 conserved current : to couple a massive photon to such a current via a purely imaginary charge . to see this ,",
    "let us write a proca lagrangian for a massive photon field with an external source : @xmath94    the equation of motion for the photon field is @xmath95    at energy scales well below the photon mass @xmath72 , the kinetic term @xmath96 may be neglected with respect to the mass term @xmath97 .",

    "( [ londonright ] ) .",
    "there are other consequences of a vev @xmath1 on which we may speculate .",
    "such a background may have cosmological effects , a line of thought which might connect , for instance , with @xcite . also , it is conceivable that such a vev might have some relation to the problem of baryogenesis , since it gives the background finite fermion number and spontaneously breaks cpt , a violation which can ease the sakharov condition of thermodynamical non - equilibrium @xcite .",
    "it has recently been suggested that the standard model might be formulated without a higgs scalar field , by introducing instead fermion self - interactions which do not destroy the renormalizability of the theory if there are nonzero uv fixed points under the renormalization group operation @xcite .",
    "that work , published after the first manuscript of the present paper had appeared in the pre - print archive , might well relate to the mechanism we have described , particularly in light of what was discussed in the previous section of this paper .",
    "all these tentative ideas are left for possible consideration in the future .",
    "we have presented a stable effective theory in which a chemical potential term is dynamically generated , thus spontaneously breaking li ( as well as c , cp , and cpt ) .",
    "the main reasons why this theory might be interesting are the following : ( a ) that it might serve as the starting point for models with emergent gauge bosons , ( b ) that it could conceivably point to li breaking in other more natural theories that share its fundamental attribute : attraction between particles of the same fermion number sign ( something that is seen in non - abelian gauge theories such as qcd , which allows bound states with non - zero baryon number ) and ( c ) that it produces something that could perhaps interest those who study the phenomenology of lorentz violation in electrodynamics : the breaking of li by introducing a background source with its own rest frame .    all of these remain somewhat problematic because ( a ) our work applies directly not to the more interesting case of generating emergent gravitons , but only to photons , ( b ) so far we have not been able to produce models that spontaneously break li which are significantly more natural than eq .",
    "( [ ajv ] ) , which is a non - renormalizable theory in which the fermion self - coupling has the opposite sign to what is obtained by integrating out a heavy @xmath2 gauge boson , and ( c ) it remains to be seen whether a phenomenology of electrodynamics with a background source is of any interest to the effort of explaining the supposed indications of lorentz violation in cosmic ray data and other measurements .",
