    "recycled millisecond pulsars are old objects but their previous accreting binary phase may have altered their physical properties in particular the magnetic field strength . in this context , the possibility that a sizeable fraction of the entire fossil population is re - heated by accretion from interstellar medium and becomes detectable in the euv / x - ray domain is exciting .",
    "this could allow an observational study of old neutron stars and give access to information on past stellar formation , heating and cooling mechanisms and magnetic field decay .",
    "this idea was first proposed by ostriker , rees & silk ( 1970 ) .",
    "population synthesis models were later computed by treves & colpi ( 1991 ) , blaes & madau ( 1993 ) and madau & blaes ( 1994 ) . a recent and extensive review on current issues can be found in treves et al .",
    "early models predicted that a rather large number of rosat xrt all - sky survey ( rass ) sources could be accreting ins , initiating several optical identification campaigns . in this paper",
    "we shall describe the general observational properties of the ins discovered by rosat , discuss the possible x - ray powering mechanisms , consider what identification campaigns can tell us so far on the total population and discuss in more details the pulsating sources .",

    "the group of ins discovered by rosat shares a rather well defined set of properties .",
    "although each of these features may be present individually in sub groups of ins ( e.g. some radio pulsars have very soft x - ray spectra and some x - ray emitting radio quiet ins are found in snr environments ) , the properties characterizing this new group are never encountered together in previously known classes of ins .",
    "all rosat discovered ins exhibit soft x - ray spectra which at the energy resolution of the pspc can be very well fitted by blackbody models with temperatures in the range of @xmath0 50 to 120 ev .",
    "no bright x - ray hard component seems to be present , at least at the level encountered in most x - ray detected radio pulsars .",
    "another common spectral feature is the low n@xmath4  towards these sources ( @xmath0 10@xmath5 @xmath6 ) which implies distances of the order of 100 to 1000pc at most .",
    "0.5 cm [ radiointensity ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      accretion of interstellar matter onto old neutron stars can produce x - ray luminosities large enough to detect a sizeable fraction of the total galactic population .",
    "assuming bondi - hoyle accretion , the mass accretion rate is @xmath7 @xmath0 10@xmath8 n @xmath9 gs@xmath10 with",
    "v the neutron star velocity with respect to interstellar medium and n the mean density .",
    "the temperature of the polar cap heated by accretion is @xmath11  @xmath0 20 ( @xmath7/10@xmath8gs@xmath10)@xmath12 f@xmath13 ev with f the relative surface area of the polar cap .",
    "however , before matter can reach the neutron star surface a number of conditions must be fulfilled .",
    "the first one is that ram pressure at accretion radius exceeds pulsar momentum flux otherwise the star is in the ejector state .",
    "this requires the spin period to be less than @xmath0 9 @xmath14 n@xmath13 @xmath15s .",
    "magnetic dipole braking allows to reach this period in @xmath0 5 @xmath16 n@xmath17 @xmath18 gyr ( blaes & madau 1993 ) .",
    "the most constraining condition is that the corotation radius must be larger than the alfven radius . for the low accretion rates prevailing here",
    ", this condition requires very slow rotation p@xmath19 @xmath20 3000 @xmath21 n@xmath22 @xmath23s .",
    "dipole magnetic radiation is not efficient enough to slow down the neutron star on a reasonable time scale .",
    "braking is probably achieved by the propeller mechanism which acts on a short time scale of @xmath0 0.8 @xmath24 n@xmath25 @xmath26 gyr ( blaes & madau 1993 ) .",
    "the first constraints came from the general identification campaigns which aimed at a complete census of the rass source population at different flux levels and galactic latitudes .",
    "in addition a number of projects specifically searching for ins were initiated .",

    "( 1997 ) , motch et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , belloni et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and danner et al .",
    "( 1998 ) reported on deep surveys in small areas including molecular clouds .",
    "shallow surveys of large areas were performed by manning et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , bade et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and thomas et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , among others .",
    "these campaigns led to the discovery of the handful of candidates discussed here .",
    "they also yielded the unexpected result that the number of ins present in the rass was far below that predicted by early population synthesis models which assumed that a few thousands neutron stars should be detected in the rass .",
    "the results of these observational constraints have been summarized by neuhuser & trmper ( 1998 ) .",
    "we show an updated version of their figure 1 in fig .",
    "2 . at the faint flux end ,",
    "upper limits on rosat ins densities are incompatible with model predictions from treves & colpi ( 1991 ) and blaes & madau ( 1993 ) ( not shown ) but still consistent with the revised models of madau & blaes ( 1994 ) .",
    "the most recent large sky area searches ( labeled a , b and c in fig .",
    "2 ) yield even stronger constraints .",
    "the results ( a ) of danner et al .",
    "( 1998 ) is restricted to dark clouds area and is therefore not directly comparable with model predictions .",
    "constraints labeled b and c cover large unbiased sky areas .",
    "( c ) results from the identification of very bright soft rosat sources with @xmath27 @xmath20 20  by thomas et al .",
    "the upper limit shown in ( b ) is derived from an identification campaign of soft sources over @xmath0 1/4 of the whole sky conducted at eso ( motch et al .",
    "optical identification of a total of 116 sources down to a pspc count rate of 0.17 cts / s yielded only 3 possible cases among which 2 are already known ins .",
    "spectral selection is discussed in motch et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "contrary to other studies , surveys ( b ) and ( c ) assume that accreting ins are intrinsically soft sources and preselect candidates on the basis of rosat pspc hardness ratios .",
    "the brightest ins found in the rass without spectral selection are indeed soft and a soft spectrum is also theoretically expected ( e.g. zampieri et al . 1995 ) .",
    "however , the possibility remains that because of the spectral preselection a fraction of the population , for instance ins accreting in very dense medium , escapes the search .",
    "the painstaking optical identification campaigns have yielded the very significant and unexpected result that the number of accreting old ins shining in x - rays is a factor 10 to 1000 below that predicted by population synthesis models .",
    "this discrepancy points to a fundamental error in one or more of the model assumptions used .",
    "constraints on an accreting population may be even stronger since ; i ) the observed logn - logs is almost consistent with a young cooling neutron star population only and ii ) for none of the ins candidates discovered so far can the accreting model be unambiguously established by the discovery of x - ray variability or the measurement of a negative @xmath28 for instance . in two cases ins",
    "are found in regions of particularly low mean densities contrary to naive expectations ( n @xmath29 0.4 and 0.3 @xmath30 for rx j0720@xmath313125 and rx j1605 + 3249 respectively ) .",
    "very low relative velocities of less than 10 km s@xmath10  must be assumed to account for the observed luminosities .",
    "however , selection effects and ism patchiness on very small scales may solve this paradox .",
    "finally , accretion should enrich neutron star atmosphere in h and he and could cause a brighter optical continuum than observed ( pavlov et al .",
    "newly born neutron stars must be spun down efficiently before they can start accreting from the interstellar medium . the evolution of magnetic field with time seems a key parameter as it both determines braking strength during ejector and propeller phases and the minimum period allowing accretion .",
    "treves et al .",
    "( 1999 ) argue that for certain values of initial magnetic field and decay time scales , the life time of the ejector phase may be longer than the age of the galaxy .",
    "colpi et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and livio et al . (",
    "1998 ) also showed that field decay significantly increases the duration of the propeller phase with the consequence that most old neutron stars could still not be able to accrete . because of the steep dependence of bondi - hoyle accretion rate with relative velocity , the velocity distribution of old neutron stars is another key parameter .",
    "early models were based on the work of narayan & ostriker ( 1990 ) . since then new observations by lyne & lorimer ( 1994 ) suggest a typical mean velocity at birth of the order of 450 km s@xmath10  about twice that of narayan & ostriker ( 1990 ) .",
    "these two effects may cooperate to explain the small number of x - ray detections .",
    "two ins , rx j0720@xmath313125 and possibly rx j0420@xmath315022 have long rotation periods which modulate their x - ray light curve by 20 to 80 % . these spin period",
    "are significantly longer than those generally measured in radio pulsars . in the accretion scenario ,",
    "the spin period yields an estimate of the surface magnetic field which has to be weaker than @xmath0 10@xmath8 g to allow for accretion ( haberl et al . 1997 ) .",
    "if confirmed , this would clearly point to secular magnetic field decay .",
    "unfortunately , alternative explanations exist .",
    "based on the similarity of spin periods haberl et al .",
    "( 1997 ) proposed that rx j0720@xmath313125 is related to class of anomalous ( braking ) x - ray pulsars ( axps ) .",
    "the nature of axps itself remains a mystery .",
    "two models often mentioned are i ) isolated neutron stars evolving from thorne-@xmath32ytkow objects ( van paradijs et al .",
    "1995 ) and accreting from a remnant disk and ii ) magnetars ( thompson & duncan 1996 ) . an interpretation in terms of a cooling neutron star faces the difficulty to reconcile thermal and rotational ages . for rx j0720@xmath313125 , @xmath11=",
    "8 10@xmath33 k implies ages in the range of 1 to 4 10@xmath33yr ( heyl & hernquist 1998 ) whereas the time required to spin down from a short birth period to 8.39s with dipole radiation is @xmath0 1.2 10@xmath2 @xmath34yr .",
    "this discrepancy may be solved assuming the star was born with a long period .",
    "alternatively , heyl & hernquist ( 1998 ) proposed the exciting possibility that rx j0720@xmath313125 is a magnetar with b@xmath0 10@xmath35 g , similar to those proposed to explain soft-@xmath36 repeaters and axps . because radio emission is quenched by the strong magnetic field magnetars",
    "remain undetected by classical radio means",
    ". their birth rate may be @xmath0 10% of that of ordinary pulsars ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "gotthelf & vasisht ( 1999 ) also argue that a large fraction of snr contains previously unrecognized slowly rotating , radio - quiet and x - ray bright pulsars which could be the natural progenitors of the long period ins discovered by rosat .",
    "the high magnetic field allows efficient magnetic dipole spin down and its decay provides an additional source of heat which allows magnetars to remain detectable in x - rays over longer times than ordinary pulsars .",
    "consequently , although less numerous than normal pulsars , cooling magnetars may show up in comparable numbers in x - ray surveys .",
    "all optical identification campaigns carried out so far confirm the scarcity of x - ray emitting isolated neutron stars in the rosat all sky survey . clearly , the large population of old galactic neutron stars does not accrete from interstellar medium at the rate predicted by early models , or the accretion energy is re - radiated outside the rosat energy band .",
    "this unexpected result tells us something fundamental on the kinematics and/or magnetic field evolution of old neutron stars and points to a secular magnetic field decay or a large mean velocity .",
    "rosat has however discovered a handful of ins sharing as common properties a soft blackbody like x - ray spectrum , absence of luminous radio emission and absence of long term variability .",
    "it is not yet proven that any of the 6 - 7 confirmed ins accretes from ism .",
    "their small number could be compatible with cooling normal pulsars whose radio beam does not cross the earth or with magnetars evolved from soft-@xmath36 repeaters , axps and more generally from the slowly rotating x - ray bright and radio quiet pulsars found in several snrs .",
    "future observations with vlts and chandra / xmm should help to solve the puzzle of the evolutionary status of this population by measuring proper motions , rotation periods and period derivatives which are key parameters to distinguish between young cooling and old accreting ins .",
    "finally these ins should allow the detailed observation of a rather unperturbed neutron star atmosphere and the accurate measurement of fundamental neutron star properties ."
