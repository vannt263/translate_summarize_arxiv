    "sentiment analysis ( sa ) is a subfield of natural language processing ( nlp ) that deals with the automatic comprehension of the opinions shared by users in different media @xcite .",
    "one of the main challenges addressed by sa focuses on emulating the semantic composition process carried out by humans when understanding the sentiment of an opinion ( i.e. , if it is favorable , unfavorable or neutral ) . in the sentence",
    "_ he is not very handsome , but he has something that i really like _",
    ", humans have the ability to infer that the word _ very _ emphasizes _ handsome _ , _ not _ affects the whole expression _ very handsome _ , and _ but _ decreases the relevance of _ he is not very handsome _ and increases the one of _ he has something that i really like_. based on this , a human could justify a positive overall sentiment on that sentence .",
    "our main contribution is the introduction of the first universal and unsupervised ( knowledge - based ) model for compositional sentiment analysis ( sa ) driven by syntax - based rules .",
    "we introduce a formalism for compositional operations , allowing the creation of arbitrarily complex rules to tackle relevant phenomena for sa , for any language and syntactic dependency annotation .",
    "we implement and evaluate a set of practical universal operations defined using part - of - speech ( pos ) tags and dependency types under the universal guidelines of and : universal annotation criteria that can be used to represent the morphology and syntax of any language in a uniform way .",
    "the model outperforms existing unsupervised approaches as well as state - of - the - art compositional supervised models @xcite on domain - transfer settings , and shows that the operations can be shared across languages , as they are defined using universal guidelines .",
    "the remainder of this article is structured as follows . ",

    "[ section - unsupervised - analysis ] introduces the formalism for compositional operations , which is used in ",
    "[ section - real - compositional - operations ] to define a set of universal rules that can process relevant linguistic phenomena for sa in any language .  [ section - experiments ] presents experimental results of our approach on different corpora and languages .",
    "finally ,  [ section - conclusions ] concludes and discusses directions for future work .",
    "in this section we describe previous work relevant to the topics covered in this article : the issue of multilinguality in sa , semantic composition through machine learning models and semantic composition on knowledge - based systems .",
    "monolingual sentiment analysis systems have been created for languages belonging to a variety of language families , such as afro - asiatic  @xcite , indo - european  @xcite , japonic  @xcite , sino - tibetan  @xcite and tai - kadai  @xcite , among others .",
    "the performance of a given approach for sentiment analysis varies from language to language . in the case of supervised systems ,",
    "the size of the training set is a relevant factor  @xcite , but performance is also affected by linguistic particularities  @xcite and the availability of language processing tools  @xcite and resources  @xcite . with respect to the latter point ,",
    "sentiment lexicons are scarce for languages other than english , and therefore a great deal of effort has been dedicated to building lexical resources for sentiment analysis  @xcite .",
    "a common approach for obtaining a lexicon for a new language consists in translating pre - existent english lexicons  @xcite , but it was found that even if the translation is correct , two parallel words do not always share the same semantic orientation across languages due to differences in common usage  @xcite .",
    "another approach for building a monolingual sa system for a new language is based on the use of machine translation ( mt ) in order to translate the text into english automatically , to then apply a polarity classifier for english , yielding as a result a kind of cross - language sentiment analysis system  @xcite .",
    "it was found that text with more sentiment is harder to translate than text with less sentiment  @xcite and that translation errors produce an increase in the sparseness of features , a fact that degrades performance  @xcite . to deal with this issue",
    ", several methods have been proposed to reduce translation errors , such as applying both directions of translation simultaneously  @xcite or enriching the mt system with sentiment patterns  @xcite . in the case of supervised systems , self - training and co - training techniques",
    "have also been explored to improve performance  @xcite .",
    "few multilingual systems for sa tasks have been described in the literature .",
    "banea et al .",
    "@xcite describe a system for detecting subjectivity ( i.e. , determining if a text contains subjective or objective information ) in english and romanian texts , finding that 90% of word senses maintained their subjectivity content across both languages .",
    "xiao and guo  @xcite confirm on the same dataset that boosting on several languages improves performance for subjectivity classification with respect to monolingual methods .    regarding the few multilingual polarity classification systems described in the literature , they are based on a supervised setting . in this respect , yan et al .",
    "@xcite describe a supervised multilingual system for sa working on previously tokenized chinese and english texts .",
    "present a multilingual sa system trained on a multilingual dataset that is able to outperform monolingual systems on some monolingual datasets and that can work successfully on code - switching texts , i.e. , texts that contain terms written in two or more different languages  @xcite .",
    "some approaches rely on mt to deal with multi - linguality .",
    "balahur et al .",
    "@xcite build a supervised multilingual sa system by translating the english semeval 2013 twitter dataset  @xcite into other languages by means of mt , which improves on the results of monolingual systems due to the fact that , when multiple languages are used to build the classifier , the features that are relevant are automatically selected .",
    "they also point out that the performance of the monolingual spanish sa system trained on spanish machine translated data can be improved by adding native spanish data for training from the spanish tass 2013 twitter dataset  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , balahur and perea - ortega  @xcite inform that performance decreases when machine - translated english data is used to enlarge the tass 2013 training corpus for spanish sentiment analysis .",
    "other approaches advocate the use of language - independent indicators of sentiment , such as emoticons  @xcite , for building language - independent sa systems , although the accuracy of a system built following this approach is worse than the combined accuracy of monolingual systems  @xcite .",
    "the use of other language - independent indicators , such as character and punctuation repetitions , results in low recall  @xcite .      a nave approach to emulating the comprehension of the meaning of multiword phrases for sa consists in using _",
    "n_-grams of words , with @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the approach is limited by the curse of dimensionality , although crawling data from the target domain can help to reduce that problem @xcite .",
    "went one step forward and proposed generalized dependency triplets as features for subjectivity detection , capturing non - local relations . modeled a recursive neural network that learns compositional vector representations for phrases and sentences of arbitrary syntactic type and length .",
    "presented an improved recursive deep model for sa over dependency trees , and trained it on a sentiment treebank tagged using amazon mechanical turk , pushing the state of the art up to 85.4% on the pang and lee 2005 dataset @xcite .",
    "showed how convolutional neural networks ( cnn ) can be used for semantic modeling of sentences .",
    "the model implicitly captures local and non - local relations without the need of a parse tree .",
    "it can be adapted for any language , as long as enough data is available .",
    "showed the effectiveness of a cnn in a semeval sentiment analysis shared task @xcite , although crawling tens of millions of messages was first required to achieve state - of - the - art results .    in spite of being powerful and accurate , supervised approaches like these also present drawbacks .",
    "firstly , they behave as a black box . secondly",
    ", they do not perform so well on domain transfer applications @xcite .",
    "finally , feature and hyper - parameter engineering can be time and resource costly options .",
    "when the said limitations of machine learning models need to be addressed , unsupervised approaches are useful . in this line , proposed an unsupervised learning algorithm to calculate the semantic orientation ( so ) of a word .",
    "presented a lexical rule - based approach to handle relevant linguistic phenomena such as intensification , negation , _ but _ clauses and _ irrealis_. released sentistrength , a multilingual unsupervised system for micro - text sa that handles negation and intensification , among other web linguistic phenomena .",
    "it is limited to snippet - based and word - matching rules , since no nlp phases such as part - of - speech tagging or parsing are applied .",
    "regarding syntax - based approaches , the few described in the literature are language - dependent .",

    "our compositional sa system will associate an so value @xmath25 to each node @xmath13 in the dependency tree of a sentence , representing the so of the subtree rooted at @xmath13 .",
    "the system will use a set of compositional operations to propagate changes to the semantic orientations of the nodes in the tree .",
    "once all the relevant operations have been executed , the so of the sentence will be stored as @xmath26 , i.e. , the semantic orientation of the root node .",
    "a compositional operation is triggered when a node in the tree matches a given condition ( related to its associated pos tag , dependency type and/or word form ) ; it is then applied to a scope of one or more nodes calculated from the trigger node by ascending a number of levels in the tree and then applying a scope function .",

    ", our system defines @xmath34 by means of sets of words , part - of - speech tags and/or dependency types such that the operation will be triggered if @xmath11 , @xmath35 and/or the head dependency of @xmath13 are in those sets .",
    "we propose two options for the transformation function @xmath36 :    * @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the shifting factor and @xmath39 .",
    "* @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the weighting factor and @xmath42.[multiblock footnote omitted ]    the scope calculation function , @xmath33 , allows us to calculate the nodes of @xmath43 whose so is affected by the transformation @xmath36 . for this purpose ,",
    "if the operation was triggered by a node @xmath13 , we apply @xmath33 to @xmath44 , i.e. , the @xmath45th ancestor of @xmath13 ( if it exists ) , which we call the * destination node * of the operation .",
    "the proposed scopes are as follows ( see also figure [ figure - rules ] ) :    * @xmath46 ( _ destination node _ ) : the transformation @xmath36 is applied directly to the so of @xmath47 ( see figure [ figure - rules].a ) .",

    "the system developed by is used for tokenizing .",
    "although initially intended for english tweets , we have observed that it also performs robustly for many other language families ( romance , slavic , etc . ) . for part - of - speech",

    "dependency parsers are built using maltparser @xcite and maltoptimizer @xcite .",
    "we trained a set of taggers and parsers for different languages using the universal tag and dependency sets @xcite .",
    "our implementation supports the lexicon format of sentistrength , which can be plugged directly into the system .",
    "additionally , we provide the option to create different dictionary entries depending on pos tags to avoid conflicts between homonymous words ( e.g. _ i m fine _ versus _ they gave me a fine _ ) .",
    "we presented above a formalism to define arbitrarily complex compositional operations for unsupervised sa over a dependency tree . in this section ,",
    "we show the definition of the most important rules that we used to evaluate our system . in practical terms , this implies studying how syntactic constructions that modify the sentiment of an expression are represented in the annotation formalism used for the training of the dependency parser , in this case , universal treebanks .",
    "we are using examples following those universal guidelines , since they are available for more than 40 languages and , as shown in   [ section - experiments ] , the same rules can be competitive across different languages .",
    "intensification amplifies or diminishes the sentiment of a word or phrase .",
    "simple cases of this phenomenon can be _ i have * huge * problems _ or _ this is * a bit * dissapointing_. traditional lexicon - based methods handle most of these cases with simple heuristics ( e.g. amplifying or diminishing the sentiment of the word following an intensifier ) .",
    "however , ambiguous cases might appear where such lexical heuristics are not sufficient .",
    "for example , _ huge _ can be a subjective adjective introducing its own so ( e.g. _ the house is huge _ ) , but also an amplifier when it modifies a subjective noun or adjective ( e.g. _ i have huge problems _ , where it makes _ problems _ more negative ) .",
    "universal compositional operations overcome this problem without the need of any heuristic .",
    "a dependency tree already shows the behavior of a word within a sentence thanks to its dependency type , and it shows the role of a word independently of the language .",
    "figure [ figure - intensifier - rules ] shows graphically how universal dependencies represent the cases discussed above these lines .",
    "formally , the operation for these forms of intensification is : @xmath70 @xmath71 , with the value of @xmath41 depending on the strength of the intensifier as given by the sentiment lexicon .",
    "compositional operations can also be defined to manage more challenging cases , such as clauses introduced by _ but _ , considered as a special case of intensification by authors such as or .",
    "it is assumed that the main clause connected by _ but _ becomes less relevant for the reader ( e.g. _ it is expensive , * but * i love it _ ) . figure [ figure - but - rules ] shows our proposed composition operation for this clause , formally : @xmath72 with @xmath73 .",
    "note that the priority of this operation ( @xmath74 ) is lower than that of intensification ( @xmath75 ) , since we first need to process intensifiers , which are local phenomena , before resolving adversatives , which have a larger scope .",
    "negation is one of the most challenging phenomena to handle in sa , since its semantic scope can be non - local ( e.g. _ i do not plan to make you suffer _ ) .",
    "existing unsupervised lexical approaches are limited to considering a snippet to guess the scope of negation .",
    "thus , it is likely that they consider as a part of the scope terms that should not be negated from a semantic point of view .",
    "dependency types help us to determine which nodes should act as negation and which should be its scope of influence . for brevity",
    ", we only illustrate some relevant negation cases and instructional examples in figure [ figure - negation - rules ] .",
    "formally , the proposed compositional operation to tackle most forms of negation under universal guidelines is : @xmath76 , where @xmath77 represents the universal tag set .",
    "the priority of negation ( @xmath78 ) is between those of intensification and _ but _ clauses because its scope can be non - local , but it does not go beyond an adversative conjuction .",
    "irrealis _ denotes linguistic phenomena used to refer to non - factual actions , such as conditional , subjunctive or desiderative sentences ( e.g. _ he * would * have died * if * he had nt gone to the doctor _ ) .",
    "it is a very complex phenomenon to deal with , and systems are either usually unable to tackle this issue or simply define rules to ignore sentences containing a list of irrealis stop - words @xcite .",
    "we do not address this phenomenon in detail in this study , but only propose a rule to deal with _ if _ constructions ( e.g. _ if i die [ ... ] _ or _ if you are happy [ ... ] _ , considering that the phrase that contains it should be ignored from the final computation . formally : @xmath79 .",
    "its graphical representation would be very similar to intensification ( see figures [ figure - rules ] a ) and e ) ) .",
    "it is hard to measure the coverage of our rules and the potential of these universal compositional operations , since it is possible to define arbitrarily complex operations for as many relevant linguistic phenomena as wished . in this line , define a set of english sentic patterns to determine how sentiment flows from concept to concept in a variety of situations ( e.g. relations of complementation , direct nominal objects , relative clauses ,  ) over a dependency tree following the guidelines .    the performance of the algorithm might vary according to the quality of the resources on which it relies .",
    "mistakes committed by the tagger and the parser might have some influence on the approach . however , preliminary experiments on english texts show that having a parser with a las over 75% is enough to properly exploit compositional operations . with respect to the lexicalized parsing ( and tagging ) models ,",
    "usually a different model is needed per language , even when using universal guidelines . in this respect ,",
    "recent studies @xcite have showed how it is possible to train a single model on universal treebanks to parse different languages with state - of - the - art results .",
    "this makes it possible to universalize one of the most relevant previous steps of our approach .",
    "the same steps can be taken to train multilingual tagging models @xcite .",
    "we compare our algorithm with respect to existing approaches on three languages : english , spanish and german .",
    "the availability of corpora and other unsupervised sa systems for english and spanish enables us to perform a richer comparison than in the case of german , where we only have an _ ad - hoc _ corpus .",
    "we compare our algorithm with respect to two of the most popular and widely used unsupervised systems : ( 1 ) so - cal @xcite , a language - dependent system available for english and spanish guided by lexical rules at the morphological level , and ( 2 ) sentistrength , a multilingual system that does not apply any pos tagging or parsing step in order to be able to do multilingual analysis , relying instead on a set of subjectivity lexica , snippet - based rules and treatment of non - grammatical phenomena ( e.g. character replication ) .",
    "additionally , for the spanish evaluation , we also took into account the system developed by , an unsupervised syntax - based approach available for spanish but , in contrast to ours , heavily language - dependent .",
    "for comparison against state - of - the - art supervised approaches , we consider the deep recursive neural network presented by , trained on a movie sentiment treebank ( english ) . to the best of our knowledge , there are no semantic compositional supervised methods for spanish and german .",
    "accuracy is used as the evaluation metric for two reasons : ( 1 ) it is adequate for measuring the performance of classifiers when the chosen corpora are balanced and ( 2 ) the selected systems for comparison also report their results using this metric .",
    "we selected the following standard english corpora for evaluation :    * corpus : a general - domain collection of 400 long reviews ( 200 positive , 200 negative ) about hotels , movies , computers or music among other topics , extracted from epinions.com .",

    ". the system also obtains results very similar to the ones reported by , even though their system is language - dependent and the set of rules is fixed and written specifically for spanish .    in order to check the validity of our approach for languages other than english and spanish",
    ", we have considered the case of german .",
    "it is worth noting that the authors of this article have no notions of german at all . in spite of this , we have been able to create a state - of - the - art unsupervised sa system by integrating an existing sentiment lexicon into the framework that we propose in this article .",

    "the results are comparable to those obtained for other languages , using a dataset of comparable size , reinforcing the robustness of our approach across different domains , languages , and base dictionaries .",
    "supervised systems are usually unbeatable on the test portion of the corpus with which they have been trained . however , in real applications , a sufficiently large training corpus matching the target texts in terms of genre , style , length , etc .",
    "is often not available ; and the performance of supervised systems has proven controversial on domain transfer applications @xcite .",

    "system @xcite , ( 2 ) a corpus of the same domain , i.e. , movies @xcite , and ( 3 ) the collection .",
    "socher et al.s system provides sentence - level polarity classification with five possible outputs : _ very positive _ , _ positive _ , _ neutral _ , _ negative _ , _ very negative_. since the and corpora are collections of long reviews , we needed to collect the global sentiment of the text . .",
    "we take the majority class , and in the case of a tie , it is classified as negative .",
    "the experimental results show that our approach obtains better results on corpora ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that our unsupervised compositional approach outperformed the supervised model not only on an out - of - domain corpus , but also on another dataset of the same domain ( movies ) as the one where the neural network was trained and evaluated .",
    "this reinforces the usefulness of an unsupervised approach for applications that need to analyze a number of texts coming from different domains , styles or dates , but there is a lack of labeled data to train supervised classifiers for all of them . as expected , is unbeatable for an unsupervised approach on the test set of the corpus where it was trained .",
    "however , our unsupervised algorithm also performs very robustly on this dataset .",
    "in this article , we have described , implemented and evaluated a novel model for universal and unsupervised sentiment analysis driven by a set of syntactic rules for semantic composition .",

    "<S> we exploit some of the main advantages of unsupervised algorithms : ( 1 ) the interpretability of their output , in contrast with most supervised models , which behave as a black box and ( 2 ) their robustness across different corpora and domains . on the other hand , by introducing the concept of compositional operations and exploiting syntactic information in the form of universal dependencies , we tackle one of their main drawbacks : their rigidity on data that are structured differently depending on the language concerned . </S>",
