    "an analog of the diffusion equation for geometries is the so - called ricci flow .",
    "this is a type of parabolic partial differential equation that homogenizes geometry in a manner similar to the homogenization of density or heat produced by the diffusion equation .",
    "the ricci flow equation was first studied in the early 1980s .",
    "it arose nearly simultaneously in mathematics @xcite , in the study of the classification of 3-geometries , and in string theory physics @xcite from the requirement that a quantized string retain conformal invariance .",
    "certain modifications of the purely geometric flow equation by `` matter terms '' motivated by string theory were central to perelman s @xcite work on the poincare conjecture .",
    "a goal of analytic work on the flow equations is to study the approach to singularities , and to understand the so - called `` ancient solutions , '' which are the non - linear analogs of the heat kernel of the diffusion equation .",
    "much of the work in this area has focused on the flow of compact geometries @xcite , with relatively little on non - compact cases such as the asymptotically flat or anti - desitter geometries . in the asymptotically flat case for dimension @xmath0 ,",
    "it has been demonstrated recently that the flow exists and remains asymptotically flat for an interval of time , with the mass remaining constant @xcite .",
    "for the rotationally symmetric case , ref .",
    "@xcite also shows that the flow is eternal for data containing no minimal surfaces .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate numerically some examples of the flow of asymptotically flat geometries , and to describe techniques that are easy to generalize to cases where matter flow equations are included .",
    "previous numerical work on ricci flows focused on the ( compact ) case of a 3-sphere that is corseted ( i.e. , a surface formed by uniformly shrinking the equator of a 3-sphere ) , where it was found that the manifold flows to a round 3-sphere or a neck pinch depending on the degree of corseting @xcite .",
    "the flow of horizon area and hawking mass has also been studied @xcite for initial data that is viewed as time symmetric data for the einstein constraint equations .",
    "numerical work pertaining to string theory aims at obtaining new black hole solutions as fixed points @xcite .",
    "the focus of the present work is the geometric flow of wormhole geometries .",
    "we study several classes of initial data and find two possible outcomes : the wormhole `` pinches off '' leaving two disjoint asymptotically flat regions , or it expands indefinitely .",
    "we also find that there is a type of critical behaviour that separates these extreme cases .",
    "the numerical methods we utilize are stable for long time flows , and have potential applicability to the largely unexplored geometry - matter cases .",
    "the hamilton - deturck ricci flow is defined by the equation @xcite @xmath1 for our work , we take @xmath2 to be the 3-metric on a manifold @xmath3 with euclidean signature and @xmath4 is the associated ricci tensor .",
    "the parameter @xmath5 labels different 3-geometries along the flow and should not be confused with the intrinsic 3-dimensional coordinates @xmath6 . finally , @xmath7 is a deturck vector field that generates diffeomorphisms along the flow .",
    "the deturck field essentially represents the freedom to change 3-dimensional coordinates as the flow progresses .",
    "it is useful to note that @xmath5 has dimensions of @xmath8^{2}$ ] and @xmath7 has dimensions of @xmath8^{-1}$ ] .",
    "we assume the 3-manifolds @xmath3 are spherically symmetric , for which a general metric _ ansatz _ is @xmath9.\\ ] ] spherical symmetry implies the following form for the deturck field : @xmath10 when ( [ eq : metric ansatz ] ) and ( [ eq : vector ansatz ] ) are put into ( [ eq : flow equation 1 ] ) we obtain two independent flow equations for @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "there is no dynamical equation for @xmath13 , so the system is underdetermined , which reflects the coordinate freedom embodied by the deturck field . to close the system , we need to fix coordinate gauges",
    "there are three choices we have investigated :    1 .",
    "[ case:1 ] @xmath14 ; 2 .",
    "[ case:2 ] @xmath15 ( conformally flat gauge ) ; or 3 .",
    "[ case:3 ] @xmath16 ( areal radius gauge ) .",
    "enforcement of condition ( [ case:2 ] ) or ( [ case:3 ] ) in the flow equations ( [ eq : flow equation 1 ] ) results in a single dynamical equation for @xmath17 or @xmath18 , respectively , and an equation of constraint for @xmath13 .",
    "the choice ( [ case:1 ] ) gives two dynamical equations for both metric functions .    for our purposes ,",
    "a wormhole geometry is defined by a metric ( [ eq : metric ansatz ] ) that has two asymptotically flat regions as @xmath19 .",
    "the combination @xmath20 should be non - zero for all @xmath21 , and the wormhole throat ( or throats ) are located at local minima @xmath22 of this function as being embedded in 4-dimensional lorentzian spacetimes as moments of time symmetry , each wormhole throat represents an apparent horizon .",
    "however , if the @xmath3 are embedded with non - zero extrinsic curvature , such an interpretation is not possible . ]",
    "@xmath23 the definition of the wormhole throat suggests a convenient coordinate gauge choice is given by case ( [ case:3 ] ) above , with line element @xmath24 in this gauge the area of 2-spheres of constant @xmath21 is @xmath25 , hence the name `` areal radius '' gauge .",
    "the condition @xmath26 reduces the flow equations ( [ eq : flow equation 1 ] ) to [ eq : main equations ] @xmath27 as mentioned above , the latter is a constraint equation .",
    "these equations must be supplemented by boundary conditions and initial data . in the areal radius gauge ,",
    "asymptotic flatness requires that @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are two length scales .",
    "putting this asymptotic limit into ( [ eq : flow equation 2 ] ) and ( [ eq : constraint equation ] ) , we obtain @xmath31 the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath32 suggests that we search for solutions that are even functions of @xmath21 .",
    "we then only need to consider the interval @xmath33 , and we have the additional boundary condition @xmath34 the boundary conditions imply that there is always a local extrema of @xmath32 at @xmath35 . if this is a minima , then there is a throat at @xmath35 . to complete the specification of the flow , we need to give initial data for @xmath32 at @xmath36 .",
    "the various classes of initial data considered in this work are described in  [ sec : morris - thorne ] and  [ sec : bubbles ] .",
    "finally , we note that it is possible to embed the 3-geometries ( [ eq : areal radius gauge ] ) in 4-dimensional flat space @xmath37 via the parametric equations @xmath38 these embeddings are only possible for areal radius functions satisfying @xmath39 .",
    "we use these as a tool for the visualization of ricci flow initial data in figs .",
    "[ fig : embedding 1 ] and [ fig : embedding 2 ] .",
    "we solve the equations ( [ eq : flow equation 2 ] ) and ( [ eq : constraint equation ] ) numerically using finite difference methods .",
    "the computational domain is defined by @xmath40 $ ] and @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "the spatial and temporal intervals are discretized into elements of size @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively .",

    "the neumann boundary condition ( [ eq : neumann ] ) is imposed explicitly , while the asymptotic boundary conditions ( [ eq : asymptotic bc 1 ] ) and ( [ eq : asymptotic bc 2 ] ) are replaced with the dirichlet conditions @xmath48 @xmath49 is fixed by the _ asymptotically flat _ initial data . with this",

    "our simulations are performed with @xmath56 .",
    "the two types of finite differencing schemes used to approximate derivatives are summarized in table [ tab : schemes ] . when applied to linear parabolic systems , the simple euler ( se ) method is known to be conditionally stable when @xmath57 .",
    "conversely , the modified dufort - frankel ( mdf ) method is known to be unconditionally stable . via direct experimentation",
    ", we have found that these conclusions also hold for the nonlinear problem given by equations ( [ eq : flow equation 2 ] ) and ( [ eq : constraint equation ] ) , which would navely suggest that the mdf method is vastly superior to the se method due to its excellent stability .",

    ", @xmath58 stands for either @xmath32 or @xmath51 .",
    "notice that for the mdf method , the second - order spatial derivative of @xmath32 is handled differently in the flow ( [ eq : flow equation 2 ] ) and constraint ( [ eq : constraint equation ] ) equations .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     however , there is a non - trivial price to be paid for this attractive feature .",

    "is the mdf approximation of @xmath60 in ( [ eq : flow equation 2 ] ) .",
    "essentially , the mdf prescription approximates @xmath61 by its _ temporal _ average @xmath62 .",
    "the use of nonlocal time data to resolve the spatial derivative gives rise to the extra @xmath63 term . ] in other words , the mdf method solves a modified version of the original system of pdes . in order to minimize the discrepancy between mdf results and the `` true '' solutions of ( [ eq : flow equation 2 ] )",
    ", one must make the ratio @xmath64 as small as is computationally feasible .",
    "the numerical results presented in this paper are obtained using the mdf method with @xmath65 . for several individual cases",
    ", we have checked that the simulation results are insensitive to the particular choice of @xmath43 and @xmath66 provided that @xmath67 , and that the mdf and se schemes give virtually identical answers for @xmath65 .",
    "the morris - thorne wormholes @xcite have spatial sections @xmath68 in this section , we will use these metrics as initial data for the ricci flow . at the initial time @xmath36 , this 3-metric can be transformed into the areal radius gauge ( [ eq : areal radius gauge ] ) by the coordinate transformation @xmath69 with @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the initial profile for the areal radius metric function .",
    "we will concentrate on a subset of this class defined by @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a length scale and @xmath74 is a dimensionless parameter ( a similar family of wormholes was defined in @xcite ) .",
    "the spatial sections of the schwarzschild metric ( known as the einstein - rosen bridge ) correspond to @xmath75 .",
    "another special case is the ellis wormhole with @xmath76 @xcite , which has @xmath77 .",
    "embedding diagrams of both types of wormholes appear in figure [ fig : embedding 1 ] . for ricci flow of these wormholes , it is useful to work with dimensionless quantities defined by @xmath78 when the hatted - variables are substituted into the flow equations the @xmath73 length scale drops out of the problem ; i.e. , our simulation results are essentially independent of @xmath73 up to trivial scalings .     to obtain a 3-dimensional plot ) . ]     under the ricci flow for morris - thorne wormhole initial data corresponding to @xmath79 and @xmath76 .",
    "note that our boundary conditions ensure that the wormhole throat is always at @xmath35 for these simulations . ]    in figure [ fig : explicit evolution ] , we show the results of our simulations for the evolution of the areal radius function @xmath18 for the einstein - rosen and ellis cases .",
    "one can see in figure [ fig : embedding 1 ] that the initial data for the two scenarios are visually quite similar .",
    "however , the evolution of @xmath32 is entirely different : in the ellis case the areal radius tends to diverge for all @xmath21 as @xmath80 , while for the einstein - rosen bridge @xmath32 is everywhere decreasing and the wormhole throat pinches off in finite time . due to computing limitations",
    ", we can not determine the ultimate fate of the ellis initial data , but it appears to be a warped cylinder with a monotonically increasing radius .    in figure",
    "[ fig : throat evolution ] , we plot the evolution of the throat radius @xmath81 for various values of @xmath74 .",
    "we find that the wormhole throat pinches off for initial data with @xmath74 less than a critical value @xmath82 . for cases with @xmath83 ,",
    "the throat approaches an ever - expanding state after a brief initial period of contraction .",
    "numerically , we have determined the value of the critical parameter to be approximately 1.259 . for @xmath84 ,",
    "the throat radius appears to grow like @xmath85 at late times .     for various morris - thorne wormhole initial data .",
    "a geometrically interesting question is : what does the ricci flow evolution of a bubble attached to asymptotically flat space look like ? in the areal radius gauge , initial data for this kind of problem would roughly be @xmath86 where @xmath87 is some transition radius .",
    "notice that this initial data has @xmath88 and @xmath89 at @xmath35 , so it violates the boundary conditions that our code was designed to deal with .",
    "we therefore consider the related problem of a bubble attached to two asymptotically flat regions , and leave initial data of the form ( [ eq : bubble data 1 ] ) for future work .",
    "we take initial data for the current problem to be @xmath90 here , @xmath91 and @xmath92 are selected such that both @xmath32 and @xmath93 are continuous at the transition points @xmath94 . defining the dimensionless parameter @xmath95 , we show embedding diagrams for two examples of this type of initial data in figure [ fig : embedding 2 ] .",
    "note that there are two wormhole throats ( local minima of @xmath32 ) in this case at @xmath96 , while there is a local maxima of @xmath32 at @xmath97 .",
    "this maxima corresponds to the equator of our bubble , and it is easy to show that the ratio of the throat radii to the equator radius is @xmath98 hence , in order to have sensible initial data with @xmath99 we are obliged to take @xmath100 .        making use of the dimensionless quantities ( [ eq : dimensionless ] ) , we have simulated the ricci flow evolution of various types of bubble geometries . as in  [ sec : morris - thorne ] above , we take @xmath32 to be an even function of @xmath21 and impose the boundary condition that @xmath101 for @xmath35 .",
    "we find that for @xmath102 initially small , the bubbles disappear and the geometry `` pinches - off '' into a pair of disjoint asymptotically flat regions .",
    "for @xmath102 initially close to unity , the bubbles also disappear and the areal radius blows up , somewhat similar to the @xmath83 cases in  [ sec : morris - thorne ] .",
    "explicit examples of these behaviours are shown in figure [ fig : bubble evolution ] .",
    "we have observed that the ricci flow of certain families of rotationally symmetric wormhole geometries exhibit a form of critical behaviour : wormhole throats pinch off or expand forever depending on the values of initial data parameters .",
    "the expanding solutions are perhaps surprising at first sight , but are nevertheless understandable in that they appear to converge to an infinite volume cylindrical attractor .",
    "this work complements both the analytic work on the flow of asymptotically flat geometries @xcite and the numerical work on corsetted 3spheres @xcite .",
    "it would be of interest to see if the neck pinching seen in our simulations of wormhole throats may be modeled by the bryant steady solitons , as has been observed for rotationally symmetric geometries on @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "the methods we have used have applicability to a variety of situations for relevance to string theory , where the renormalization group flows give matter coupled modifications of ricci flow .",
    "the interest here is in discovering new fixed points of physical relevance .",
    "for example , in special cases with compact target spaces and a tachyon field , there is evidence that properties of the tachyon potential are linked to the existence of non - trivial fixed points @xcite .",
    "it is of interest to extend such cases to non - compact geometries with gauge or 2-form fields , and consider questions such as the possibility of stabilization of wormholes geometries .",
