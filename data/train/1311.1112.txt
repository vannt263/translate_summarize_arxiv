    "disks surrounding young stellar objects ( ysos ) are critical to our understanding of star formation . not only do circumstellar disks provide a mechanism for angular momentum transport and accretion onto the central star during formation , but they also serve as the birthplace of planets .",
    "the _ hubble space telescope _ has produced dramatic images of protoplanetary disks ( `` proplyds '' ) surrounding young ( @xmath4  year old ) stars in the orion nebula  @xcite . the intense ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation field of the high - mass trapezium stars heats the disk surfaces to a few thousand degrees , which drives a photo - ablation flow , and produces bright ionization fronts  @xcite .",
    "disk mass - loss rates in ysos due to external photoevaporation place strong temporal constraints on planet formation mechanisms in irradiated environments near o - type stars ; which is important since a significant fraction of stars forms in clusters with high - mass stars  @xcite . furthermore , mounting evidence  from solar system size to meteoritics ",
    "now strongly suggests that our own solar system in fact formed in a large stellar cluster , perhaps similar to the onc  ( * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "so it is clearly important to gain an understanding of how efficient planet formation is for low - mass stars forming in clusters with high - mass members , both to predict the frequency of planetary systems and to better understand the evolution of our own solar system .",
    "the formation and evolution of dust grains in proplyd systems is key to understanding overall system evolution and whether or not the disks might produce planets . like other circumstellar disks around young stars",
    ", it is thought that dust grains will grow via accretion and agglomeration .",
    "dust grains are also thought to be entrained in the photoevaporative flow off the disk , effectively removing material from the grain - growth process . if the photoevaporative entrainment is very efficient , then we would not expect to see evidence for larger grain sizes .",
    "mid - ir observations of the orion proplyds closest to @xmath0  c  clearly show strong emission both from the proplyd itself , and from the large wind - wind shock fronts where the photoevaporation flow rams into the stellar wind from @xmath0  c  @xcite , suggesting that the grains are indeed entrained in the photoevaporative flow . at the same time , in the case of proplyd , measurements of the extinction curve through the outer parts of the disk indicate grain growth to sizes larger than typical in the ism  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , silicate emission profiles observed for a number of proplyds are similar to other low - mass ysos and reveal that the grains are both larger than normal ism sizes and chemically processed  @xcite . though it appears that dust is entrained in the photoevaporative flow , it is still not clear whether this has a significant effect on the growth of grains in the circumstellar disk .",
    "is one of the largest proplyds in orion : the outer cometary - shaped ionization front ( if ) is roughly 10 @xmath5 2.5  in size  corresponding to approximately 420  au @xmath5 1000  au at the distance of orion  pc  @xcite throughout the paper.]making hst-10 one of the few proplyds that can be resolved from the ground . unlike the proplyds near @xmath0  c , hst-10 has no bright stand - off shock due to wind - wind collision . at the center of the cometary envelope",
    "is an edge - on silhouette disk with a radius of 0.18  @xcite , corresponding to a radius of 75  au , with a disk mass of @xmath6  m@xmath7  @xcite .",
    "though dark in continuum and h@xmath8  images , the disk glows in both  and h@xmath2  @xcite , indicating that the photoevaporative flow off the disk is driven by the far - uv rather than the extreme - uv radiation field  @xcite .",
    "one of the most notable features of hst-10 is that  unlike other proplyds in orion  the long - axis of the envelope does _ not _ point toward @xmath0  c  but instead appears to be aligned with the rotation axis of the disk .    in this letter , we present high spatial resolution ground - based near - infrared images of the orion proplyd hst-10 using keck / nirc2 with the laser guide star adaptive optics system that resolves the if and disks down to size scales of 23  au .",
    "we also present multi - epoch analysis of hh objects near hst-10 that are aligned with the rotational axis of the silhouette disk  clearly indicating that hst-10 has a strong outflow component .",
    "these observations indicate that the orientation and morphology of hst-10 is somewhat more complex than previously thought .",
    "narrow - band imaging observations of hst-10 were acquired with nirc2-keck  ii in lgs - ao mode on 17 nov 2006 using keck observatory director s discretionary time .",
    "data were acquired in the nirc2 narrow camera providing a scale of 10 mas / pixel ( fov : 10 ) .",
    "observations were carried out using a 3-point dither pattern with a total integration time of 15  min for each filter .",
    "natural seeing at the beginning of the night was 0.85  in k - band .",
    "fwhm of the ao - corrected psf was 80  mas ( 34  au at orion ) with a 10 - 15% strehl ratio . spatial resolution in our images of hst-10 are the among the highest available from the ground and are comparable to optical images achieved by hst .",
    "flat - fielding , sky subtraction , and bad - pixel replacement were handled using standard near - ir techniques .",
    "the final images for each filter are shown in figure  [ fig : hst10_nirc2 ] .",
    "both br  @xmath1  and  emission are brightest in the northern `` head '' of the hst-10 envelope and exhibit the same morphology as seen in hst images of similar spatial resolution  @xcite .",
    "emission from the ionized gas appears to peak on the side of the envelope facing @xmath0  c , the dominant source of euv radiation .",
    "the hst-10 envelope shows a slight limb brightening in br  @xmath1  that is not apparent in the  emission , as expected for an `` inside - out '' pdr structure .",
    "the 04 diameter circular structure apparent at the head of the proplyd is also apparent in h@xmath8  and especially o  [ i ] hst images  @xcite .",
    "this circular structure may be due to the interaction between a jet ( also apparent in o  [ i ] ) and the edge of the proplyd envelope  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the hst-10 proto - planetary disk is resolved at all observed wavelengths ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hst10_nirc2 ] ) .",
    "while the edge - on disk remains dark in images of the ionized gas , it is bright in the h@xmath2 and pah ( 3.3  ) filters .",
    "furthermore , the h@xmath2  and pah emission appear to come from a thin `` skin '' on the surface of the disk which is spatially resolved at these wavelengths for the first time .",
    "the intensity of both the h@xmath2 and pah emission is clearly brighter on the south and east edges of the disk , which could simply be an inclination effect .",
    "however , the discrepancy may also be due to differences in physical conditions at the surface of the disk , which will be discussed further below . h@xmath2  and  emission from the disk are nearly identical in morphology , including a significant `` knot '' of emission in the center of the southern edge thought to be associated with shock emission from a neutral jet  @xcite .",
    "the pah emission from the disk is similar to that seen in  and h@xmath2  except that no knot is seen on the south side , presumably because pahs can not survive in the shock - excited region responsible for the knot .",
    "the morphology of the pah emission beyond the disk differs significantly from that of the extended gas and dust .",
    "the pah emission at 3.3  appears to trace the inner edge of the if on the east side of the central disk and is nearly identical to the morphology observed in the 11.25  pah band  ( pah2 , * ? ? ?",
    "as noted by @xcite , the pah emission is also well - correlated with the dark features seen in h@xmath8  images ( fig .  [",
    "fig : hst10_nirc2 ] ) which suggests that these dark lanes are due primarily to small grains .",
    "the overall asymmetry of the pah emission in the hst-10 envelope will be discussed below .",
    "observed proplyd morphology is a consequence of photoevaporation of the circumstellar disk by uv radiation from one side ( @xmath0  c  in this case ) in addition to isotropic nebular uv radiation .",
    "the combination of these effects produces the familiar if head - tail morphology aligned with @xmath0  c. the photoevaporative flow from a disk subjected to _ both _",
    "strong fuv and euv radiation can be modeled as two coupled parker winds : a supersonic _ neutral _ wind off the disk and a second supersonic _ ionized _ wind off the if  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "if the if is _ beyond _ the sonic point for the neutral wind ( as is the case for hst-10 ) , then a `` shocked neutral shell '' is formed just inside of the if where the gas is down - shocked to subsonic velocities before passing through the if .",
    "dust grains can be entrained in the photoevaporative flow only if the drag force on the grain ( due to the gas ) is greater than the gravitational force , _ and _ the grain has sufficient time to reach escape velocity from the disk  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "hence , entrainment is much more likely for small grains .",
    "pah emission from within the proplyd envelope of hst-10 indicates that small grains are indeed entrained in the flow off the disk  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* this work ) .",
    "the morphology of the pah emission in hst-10 , however , is surprising .",
    "if we adopt the model above , we would expect a symmetric distribution of pah emission tracing the neutral shell just inside the if  but this is not observed . instead , the pah emission is just inside the if on the _ east _ side of the envelope , and non - existent on the west side ( this is also evident in the dark extinction lanes visible in the h@xmath8  hst image , see fig .",
    "[ fig : hst10_nirc2 ] ) .",
    "the asymmetry is unlikely to be caused by pah ionization since the 8.6  ionized pah emission reported by @xcite also appears primarily on east side of the envelope .",
    "if we assume that pahs are indeed entrained in the flow from the northern face ( and edges ) of the disk , then the lack of pah emission from the nw quadrant of the proplyd `` head '' ( toward @xmath0  c ) could be due to the `` hard '' fuv radiation that can penetrate the if into the neutral pdr , causing either pah destruction ( via 2-photon uv absorption ) or dissociation of the outer c - h bond that is responsible for 3.3  emission . the pah emission in the southern `` tail '' , however , is more problematic : if we assume that the flow off the south side of the disk is driven by the isotropic nebular uv radiation , then it is hard to explain why the pah emission is only apparent on the _ east _ side of the envelope .",
    "an alternative explanation is that hst-10 is subjected to an additional source of fuv radiation from the nearby early - b star @xmath3  a  ( 82  to the se ) which drives a photoevaporative flow off both the southern face and eastern edge that is ionized by the diffuse nebular radiation a few disk radii away .",
    "pahs are entrained in the flow off the east edge  creating a `` tail '' of pah emission in the se quadrant of the neutral envelope  but are _ not _ entrained in the flow off the south face of the disk , perhaps because gas drag forces can not overcome gravity . hence",
    ", there is little or no pah emission from the sw quadrant of the neutral envelope .",
    "clearly , additional observations are needed to better understand pah emission in photo - evaporating disk systems , but it seems plausible that additional sources of uv radiation may need to be invoked when modeling photo - ablation flows in proplyd systems .",
    "using observations obtained with hst wfpc2 in 1998 , @xcite reported the presence of a 6300    jet emerging orthogonal to the hst-10 disk on its south side that was designated hh  517 , as well as a pair of compact h@xmath8 knots located roughly 7  and 10  due south .",
    "knot s1 has a faint tail extending back towards hst-10 .",
    "in addition to these features , the northern side of hst-10 exhibits a ring of emission in the if along the expected jet axis .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : hst10_nirc2 ] , faint spikes of h@xmath8 emission extend above the proplyd if at the eastern and western ends of this ring : these features may mark the walls of an outflow cavity protruding beyond the hst-10 if .",
    "subsequent hst observations in cycles  12 and 13 using the acs / wfc ( see table  [ table : hstobservations ] ) show that the knots have large proper motions , indicating movement directly away from hst-10",
    ". observed proper motion of the knots is clearly seen in a difference image between cycles  13 and 6 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : propermotions ] ) .",
    "table  [ table : propermotions ] gives the j2000 coordinates of the photo - centers of the knots as measured on the 2004 acs h@xmath8 images along with the measured proper motions based on the three epochs of observations .",
    "inferred proper motion vectors are shown in figure  [ fig : propermotions ] .",
    "the uncertainties in the velocities and vector orientations are @xmath9% .",

    "as noted in the introduction , the ( projected ) major axis of the hst-10 envelope points about 20  _ east _ of @xmath11ori  c , and is aligned with the rotation axis of the disk to within a few degrees .",
    "this strongly suggests that the proplyd orientation is dictated by outflows associated with the star / disk system rather than the ionizing radiation from @xmath0  c. hence , we postulate that the jet and photo - ablation wind from the disk are responsible for the orientation of the hst-10 envelope .",
    "if this is the case , then the combined ram pressure of the jet and disk wind should be larger than the ram pressure of the ionized flow off the if : @xmath12 .",
    "since ram pressure scales as @xmath13 , the condition can be rewritten as : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the density and velocity for the jet , neutral flow ( `` i '' ) , and if ( `` ii '' ) . @xmath17 and @xmath18 can be approximated by the sound speed in each region : @xmath19  km  s@xmath20and @xmath21  km  s@xmath20 . from our proper motion analysis of hh  517",
    "we estimate @xmath22 to be @xmath23  km  s@xmath20 , since the actual jet velocity will be higher than the observed proper motion of the shock - front .    the h@xmath8 surface brightness of the hst-10 if can be used to estimate the electron density at the if using the emission measure and path - length  @xcite . using the cycle  12 acs wfc f658n images",
    ", we find a peak value of about @xmath24  erg  s@xmath20  @xmath25  arcsec@xmath26 along the northern rim of the proplyd where the hh  517 counter - jet forms a ring - shaped breakout . from the observed projected thickness of the hst-10 if ( @xmath27 ) the los path - length along the limb - brightened edge of the proplyds is about 200  au , consistent with the apparent thickness of @xmath28  au for the h@xmath8 bright layer .",
    "hence the peak density along the northwestern if of hst-10 is @xmath29  @xmath30 .    since the flow off the disk must also pass ( eventually ) through the if , we can calculate @xmath31 from @xmath32 using simple mass conservation : @xmath33 assuming spherical geometry and our adopted velocities . assuming spherical geometry , a disk radius of 75  au , if distance from the disk of 250  au , @xmath19  km  s@xmath20 , and @xmath21  km  s@xmath20 , we estimate a molecular hydrogen density at approximately the disk surface of @xmath34  @xmath30 .",
    "the h@xmath8 surface brightness from the hst images can also be used to estimate the electron density in the hh  517 knots . using the f658n image",
    ", we find @xmath35 erg s@xmath20 @xmath25 arcsec@xmath26 and hence @xmath36 @xmath37  pc for hh  517 knot s2 .",
    "assuming spherical symmetry , @xmath38 124 au , hence @xmath39",
    "this can also be considered an _ upper bound _ for the overall jet density , @xmath40 , since the hh regions are compressed , post - shock gas .    inserting the estimated velocities and densities into equation  [ eq : ratio ]",
    ", we find : @xmath41 suggesting that the jet and neutral wind from hst-10 is indeed powerful enough to re - orient the envelope along the disk axis rather than the axis toward @xmath0  c. note , however , that the adopted @xmath40 is an upper bound on the jet density , which drives the ram pressure ratio _ lower _ ; and conversely , @xmath22 is a _ lower bound _ on the jet velocity since it is based on the observed hh object proper motions , which drives the pressure ratio higher ( much higher , in fact , since the pressure increases with @xmath42 ) .",
    "our comparison of the ram pressures shows that a jet and outflow - dominated orientation ( as observed ) is plausible , though a more detailed analysis and modeling is required to understand how the interaction between the jet and the photo - ablation flow produce the observed if .",
    "this result suggests that for proplyds far from the ionizing source , envelope orientation may be dominated by ram pressure associated with star / disk outflows , rather than the pressure exerted by the if . a review of proplyd orientations in @xcite shows , however , that nearly all proplyd orientations are in fact aligned with the ionizing source regardless of projected distance , making hst-10 unique .",
    "hst-10 also has one of the largest silhouette disks among proplyds with bright ionization fronts ( the largest silhouette disk in orion , d114 - 426 , has no obvious if and is thought to reside in the foreground of the nebula ) .",
    "if the photo - ablation wind and jet scale up with the disk size , then this suggests that most of the proplyds have disks that are simply too small to re - orient the proplyd envelope and that hst-10 is unique in that it still has a large disk and is close enough to both @xmath0  c  and @xmath3  a  to produce a bright if .",
