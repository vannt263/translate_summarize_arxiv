    "this technique is limited since the information on the faint object is always mixed with the light emitted by the main source .",
    "consequently , direct imaging is to be preferred and the analysis of the object is made easier in the image domain than in the fourier spectrum one . since the beginning of high resolution imaging , measurements have never been achieved both with a very high resolution in the range of nanoradian and a very high dynamics in the range of @xmath0 . in order to meet this challenge a. labeyrie has proposed a solution which is known as the hypertelescope @xcite .",

    "these monomode waveguides are fed by two independent distributed feedback lasers ( dfb ) with the same emitting wavelength and act as two incoherent point like sources . this way the object is spatially incoherent and the dynamics",

    "the best dynamics experimentally observed with our breadboard are in the range of 300 but as shown on figure [ dyn_evol ] these results are not stable over time , probably due to environmental perturbations such as acoustic waves , vibrations or temperature fluctuations .",
    "nevertheless , such results have been obtained reliably and give a first indication on the tht imaging potential capabilities . as we will demonstrate in the next paragraph , the major limitation on the dynamics results from the manual cophasing that remains of poor quality when compared with a servo controlled system .",
    "the main effect is a reduction of the dynamics that is particularly clear in the apodized configuration .",
    "these first tests demonstrate the possibility to image a point - like source on axis .      the phenomena able to reduce the psf dynamics can be listed as follows :    * the residual optical path difference between the 8 interferometric arms .",
    "* the differential polarization properties between the 8 fields to be mixed due to differential birefringent properties of the interferometric arms .",
    "* the difference between the theoretical results reported in @xcite and the apodization really applied in the experiment . * the differential dispersion properties between the 8 interferometric arms .",

    "<S> in this paper , we report the first experimental demonstration of a temporal hypertelescope ( tht ) . </S>",
    "<S> our breadboard including 8 telescopes is firstly tested in a manual cophasing configuration on a 1d object . </S>",
    "<S> the point spread function ( psf ) is measured and exhibits a dynamics in the range of 300 . </S>",
    "<S> a quantitative analysis of the potential biases demonstrates that this limitation is related to the residual phase fluctuation on each interferometric arm . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , an unbalanced binary star is imaged demonstrating the imaging capability of tht . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , 2d psf is recorded even if the telescope array is not optimized for this purpose .    </S>",
