    "collision of relativistic heavy - ions produces hot nuclear matter that can be described using the relativistic hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "i will refer to this matter as the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) leaving aside the issues of its equilibration and thermalization .",
    "valence electric charges of the colliding ions are not a part of the plasma , as they continue on the incident trajectory along the beam directions with very little deflection @xcite .",
    "however , they create strong electromagnetic field ( emf ) that influences the plasma behavior @xcite . electrically conducting plasma responds by generating induced emf .",
    "the resulting emf is a solution to a complicated magneto - hydrodynamic problem . as a first approximation ,",
    "one can rely on slow time - dependence of the relevant kinetic coefficients on time to decouple the maxwell equations from the time evolution of the qgp .",
    "analytical solution to these equations shows that the emf decreases with time much slower than in vacuum and is approximately collision energy independent ; rather it depends only on the impact parameter and the electrical conductivity of the qgp @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations that take into account the qgp expansion @xcite qualitatively agree with this conclusion .",
    "it has been recently realized that kinetic properties of the qgp reflect the nontrivial topological structure of the qcd . in particular",
    ", the qgp responds to the chirality imbalance by generating metastable parity - odd domains . in the presence of external magnetic field such a metastable domain induces a parallel to it electric field , which is known as the chiral magnetic effect ( cme ) @xcite .",
    "electric current generated by the cme is proportional to the external magnetic field , with the chiral conductivity @xmath1 being the proportionality coefficient . in this paper",
    ", i study the electromagnetic field generated by valence charges at finite chiral conductivity and determine the role of the chiral magnetic effect ( cme ) in the electromagnetic field dynamics in the qgp .",
    "i found a two - fold effect of the cme on the electromagnetic field evolution .",
    "firstly , the field becomes unstable because soft modes with @xmath0 grow exponentially with time .",
    "for the qgp this effects is of little importance since the largest wavelength @xmath2 that is allowed in qgp is much smaller than @xmath3 .",
    "however , in non - abelian plasmas with large spatial extent this is an important phenomenon that may lead to a breakdown of electromagnetic field into a set of knots with non - trivial topology . secondly , due to finite chiral conductivity , magnetic field , produced by valence electric charges , oscillates at early times after a heavy - ion collision . these oscillations may result in partial cancelation of the magnetic field effects , when averaged over time .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : b ] i describe the maxwell - chern - simons ( mcs ) theory , which is an elegant way to incorporate the topological effects in qed . in the mcs",
    "the chiral conductivity arises from the time - dependent @xmath4-angle .",

    "the simplest model that captures the essential dynamics of the cme effect , and that we adopt in the present study , is to neglect the space variation of @xmath4 and approximate @xmath1 by a constant . in other words we set @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "this model was used in @xcite to discuss non - trivial static topological solutions of ( [ b11])([b14 ] ) ( see below ) and in @xcite to numerically investigate time - evolution of magnetic field .",
    "the main advantage of this model is that it can be analytically solved and thus provides important insights into the dynamics of the electromagnetic fields in the presence of the chiral anomaly .",

    "<S> time evolution of an electromagnetic field created in heavy - ion collisions strongly depends on the electromagnetic response of the quark - gluon plasma , which can be described by the ohmic and chiral conductivities . </S>",
    "<S> the later is intimately related to the chiral magnetic effect . </S>",
    "<S> i argue that a solution to the classical maxwell equations at finite chiral conductivity is unstable due to the soft modes @xmath0 that grow exponentially with time . in the kinematical region </S>",
    "<S> relevant for the relativistic heavy - ion collisions , i derive analytical expressions for the magnetic field of a point charge . </S>",
    "<S> i show that finite chiral conductivity causes oscillations of magnetic field at early times . </S>"
