    "the traveling salesman problem ( tsp ) is the one of the most important optimization problems in computational sciences  @xcite . in tsp , for",
    "given number of places to visit , a traveling salesman hopes to minimize the total travel distance within the constraint that she is allowed to visit each place only once .",
    "hinted by the similarity to the problem of finding the ground state of a system with a rugged energy landscape , tsp has also been broadly studied in physics community  @xcite .",
    "there are also biologically motivated interesting methods in the study of tsp , such as the genetic algorithm  @xcite and the ant colony optimization  @xcite .",
    "although direct formulations based on tsp have broad range of applicability , we note that there are closely - related , but different , problems in reality .",
    "one among such problems is the scheduling of games in sports : in contrast to tsp , which is unilateral , i.e. , the traveling salesman is not required to take into account existences of other salesmen , many sports games are bilateral , i.e. , two teams or players should meet somewhere to play a game .",
    "designing of a tournament schedule in sports league is notoriously difficult problem to solve , which has been studied mostly in the area of computational science  @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been a significant development in the traveling tournament problem ( ttp )  @xcite , in which the task is to construct the optimal timetable to minimize the total travel distance under the constraint of a given home - and - away pattern .",
    "not surprisingly , the simulated - annealing method  @xcite , and the ant colony optimization method  @xcite have been applied , as well as more conventional methods in computer science  @xcite , to tackle ttp and similar problems .",
