    "this resonant behavior of the electronic conductance arises from the interference of the electronic wave functions inside the structure , which travel forth and back forming stationary states in the conductor region ( well - like states ) . in order to understand these results , it is convenient to define two energy regions , the low - energy range from @xmath38 up to @xmath39 @xmath23 ( corresponding to the first quantum of conductance for the pristine @xmath40 armchair ribbon ) and the high - energy range , from @xmath39 to @xmath41 @xmath23 ( corresponding to the second step of conductance of the @xmath40 pristine system ) .    , @xmath42 , x=0.7,@xmath43.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    in the low - energy range ,",

    "in these plots the linear dependence of the conductance resonances as a function of the gate voltage is manifested .",
    "it can be shown that the electronic states of a pristine armchair graphene ribbon are regularly spaced in the whole energy range@xcite , therefore , as the gate voltage is applied , there will be a high probability that the lead states become aligned with the resonant states in the central region of the structure .",

    "this effect is mainly produced by an energy shift of the localized states at the junctions , which induces a less destructive interference with the resonant states .",
    "it is important to point out that this effect only can be observed because the gate potential is applied simultaneously to both crossbar junctions , otherwise , the conductance gap would be not noticeably affected by the gate potential .",

    "two different slopes appear in the behavior of the conductance peaks as a function of the gate voltage .",
    "one of these slopes corresponds to the direct evolution of the states belonging to the crossbar junctions as a function of the gate voltage ( lower slope ) , and the higher slope corresponds to the indirect states belonging to the central region .     and",

    "( a ) it is possible to observe that for a very small separation between both junctions , the i - v characteristics exhibit abrupt slope changes , and oscillations for certain ranges of the bias voltage .",
    "this behavior is produced by the increasing number of resonant states as a result of the enlargement of the conductor central region .",
    "the applied bias voltage allows the continuum alignment of the resonant states of the system with the electronic states of the leads , leading to variations of the current intensity . on the other hand",
    ", every i - v curve shows a wide gap of zero current until certain bias voltage .",
    "this threshold value exhibits a linear dependence of the length of the central region of the conductor . as the relative distance between the junctions",
    "is increased , there are more resonant states available at lower energies because the electronic confinement in this region is weaker , therefore , the electronic transmission under a bias voltage is possible at lower voltage values .",

    "( b ) of figure [ corr ] it is possible to observe the behavior of the @xmath73 curves as a function of the length of the central region of the conductor . as this region is enlarged , the oscillations in the differential conductance become more evident .",
    "each time the bias voltage aligns the resonant states of the conductor with leads states , the current will increase and a positive change in the differential conductance occurs .",
    "however , if the bias voltage is not enough to align the states , the current drops and the differential conductance becomes negative in a range of voltage .",
    "this can be seen in the cases @xmath30 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 in the figure [ corr ] ( b ) .",

    "for instance , in the configuration considered in this figure , it can be noted abrupt changes of the differential conductance as a function of the gate voltage for bias voltages values around @xmath78 , which indicates an abrupt increasing of the current flowing through the conductor .",
