    "coherent control of quantum dynamics via a periodically oscillating external field has been one of the subjects of long - lasting interest in diverse branches of physics and chemistry  @xcite .",
    "one seminal result of the control is coherent destruction of tunneling ( cdt ) , a phenomenon originally discovered by grossmann _",
    "et al . _ in 1991 for a periodically driven double - well system  @xcite , upon the occurrence of which the tunneling can be brought to a standstill provided that the system parameters are carefully chosen . due to its importance for understanding many fundamental time - dependent processes and its potential application in quantum motor  @xcite and quantum - information processing  romero , cdt",
    "has received growing attention from both theoretical and experimental studies .",
    "theoretically , it has been extended in various forms such as nondegenerate cdt  @xcite , selective cdt  @xcite , nonlinear cdt  @xcite , many - body cdt  @xcite , instantaneous cdt  @xcite and multiphoton cdt  @xcite ; experimentally , it has been observed in many different physical systems like modulated optical coupler  @xcite , driven double - well potentials for single - particle tunneling  @xcite , three - dimensional photonic lattices  @xcite , a single electron spin in diamond  @xcite , bose - einstein condensates in shaken optical lattices  @xcite , and chaotic microcavity  @xcite .",
    "in addition to conventional approach of modulating a lattice in a uniform fashion , modulating some certain lattice sites selectively also provides an attractive alternative for generation of cdt , in which the rescaled tunneling amplitudes for different sites can be shut off effectively , thereby some intriguing quantum manipulations are realizable such as dissipationless directed transport  @xcite and beam splitter  @xcite .",
    "cdt was traditionally thought to occur only at the isolated degeneracy point of the quasi - energies and is related to dynamical localizationdunlap .",
    "however , recently a novel quantum phenomenon called dark cdt occurring over a wide range of system parameters has been introduced in odd-@xmath0-state systems  @xcite which is demonstrated to be caused by localized dark floquet state that has zero quasi - energy and negligible population at the intermediate state , rather than the superposition of degenerate floquet states .",
    "those advances on cdt studies offer benefits for coherent control of quantum dynamics .    in this paper , we propose a scheme for the control of quantum tunneling in a periodically driven lattice array with controllable boundary through combination of characteristics of both normal cdt and dark cdt .",
    "we consider the coherent motion of a quantum particle in a lattice array , in which the harmonic oscillating external fields act on only the two boundary sites of chain .",
    "we have found an interesting result that a single particle initially occupying the left boundary site experiences coherent destruction of tunneling to coherent tunneling ( cdt - ct ) transition or coherent tunneling to coherent destruction of tunneling ( ct - cdt ) transition , when the driving amplitude of the external periodic field applied to the right boundary site is increased from zero .",
    "we have also revealed that the cdt - ct transition in three - site lattice is robust against the second order coupling ( soc ) between next - nearest - neighbor sites , whereas the ct - cdt transition in four - site system is significantly affected by soc .",
    "moreover , we present a good understanding of the results with help of the high - frequency approximation analysis as well as numerical computation of the corresponding floquet states and quasi - energies .",
    "we consider a single particle in an array of lattice sites with only two boundary sites driven by external periodic field , as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : figure1 ] ) . in our model ,",
    "the left boundary site is driven with fixed driving amplitude and driving frequency , while the right boundary site is driven with varied driving amplitude and fixed driving frequency . in the tight - binding approximation and assuming a coherent dynamics , the single - particle motion can be generally described by the tight - binding hamiltonian    @xmath1    where @xmath2 represents the wannier state localized in the @xmath3th site , @xmath4 is the coupling strength connecting nearest - neighboring sites , and @xmath5 is the second - order coupling ( soc ) strength between next - nearest - neighboring sites .",
    "instead of modulating a lattice in a uniform fashion , we modulate the on - site energies selectively . in this scheme , we assume a harmonic oscillating field applied in form of @xmath6 for site 1 , and @xmath7 for site @xmath8 . here",
