    "quantal effects in the time evolution of decaying systems have been studied since the beginning of quantum mechanics .",
    "gamow s explanation of alpha - decay was among the first successful applications of quantum theory to radioactive nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the theory showed that decay was exponential in the accessible range of times , and related the lifetime to the nuclear charge @xmath2 and decay energy .",
    "khalfin  @xcite was the first to realize that , when the energy spectrum of the system is bounded from below , exponential decay can not persist as @xmath3 .",
    "eventually it has to be replaced by an asymptotic regime with a slower rate of decrease .",
    "explicit solution of the schrdinger equation for simple models of a particle escaping from a confining potential verified that in the asymptotic regime , the survival ( or non - escape ) probability shows power - law decrease  @xcite . under rather general assumptions , this power - law can be shown to be @xmath4 for finite range potentials  @xcite .",
    "some additional aspects are discussed in  @xcite , and references therein . exponential decay is observed in a wide variety of physical systems .",
    "the predicted slower decay rate at long times has proven difficult to verify , but it is a universal feature present in theoretical models .",
    "this applies not only to a particle trapped by a potential barrier , but also to the decay of a discrete state coupled to a continuum  @xcite .",
    "it is less well - known that when the confining barrier , or the coupling between discrete state and continuum , is time - dependent in the initial stages of decay , so - called `` memory effects '' affect the post - exponential survival probability of the system . these effects were proposed as a means of enhancing the survival probability , to make it feasible to observe the post - exponential regime experimentally . in particular , robinson  @xcite considered adiabatic switching - on of the system over an infinite time period , to clarify the role of switching time versus observation time .",
    "tight binding models have been widely used in condensed matter for many years @xcite , @xcite to describe tightly bound bands in crystals .",
    "more recently they have been applied to multilayered semiconductor heterostructures @xcite , to the dynamics of bloch oscillations @xcite and to the study of properties of bose condensates in a lattice @xcite .",
    "they are particularly well suited when the unit cell of the periodic struture leads to a well confined lowest energy state .    in this paper , we examine memory effects for finite switching times .",
    "we use a variant of the fano - anderson model  @xcite proposed by longhi  @xcite to study deviations from exponential decay at short times , and the zeno effect  @xcite .",
    "his model can be viewed as the decay of a discrete state coupled to a single - band tight - binding continuum .",
    "but , more interestingly from an experimental point of view , he presented it as a one dimensional semi - infinite periodic chain of discrete sites .",

    ", @xmath7 would be the half - period , the time for a complete transfer of occupation between the pair .",
    "relative isolation of the first site is obtained by fixing its coupling parameter @xmath8 to be different from the rest . under these conditions , when at @xmath9 only site 1 is occupied , longhi obtained the survival probability , its lifetime for exponential decay and the asymptotic power- law  @xcite .",

    "recent experiments , using scanning tunnelling microscopy with sensitive near - field probes , have allowed longhi and collaborators  @xcite to measure the evanescent fields along the waveguides , and provide a convincing quantitative demonstration of the classical - quantal analogy for the case of a periodic parallel array . in addition the classical analogue of the quantum zeno effect was verified  @xcite .",
