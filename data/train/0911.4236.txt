    "lacoo@xmath0 has received considerable attention over the years because it seems to undergo two electronic transitions or crossovers in the temperature range between 50 and 600 kelvin@xcite .",
    "the first crossover , usually referred to as the spin state transition , can be seen most clearly in the magnetic susceptibility @xmath3@xcite . below 50 kelvin lacoo@xmath0",
    "is nonmagnetic , @xmath4 , indicating that all co@xmath2 ions are in the low spin ( ls ) @xmath5 or @xmath6 state realized for @xmath7 in cubic symmetry with sufficiently large crystalline electric field ( cef ) .",
    "then @xmath3 rises sharply which indicates the thermal excitation of states with nonzero spin and after a maximum around 100 kelvin decreases again . in inelastic magnetic neutron",
    "scattering@xcite the low frequency magnetic scattering intensity near @xmath8 shows a very similar temperature dependence as @xmath3 .",
    "a pronounced anomaly is also observed in the coefficient of thermal expansion@xcite , the heat capacity shows only a weak anomaly at the spin state transition@xcite .",
    "et al._@xcite found that the valence band photoemission spectrum ( pes ) and o1s x - ray absorbtion spectrum ( xas ) show little or no change across the spin state transition . on the other hand , haverkort _ at al._@xcite found a significant temperature dependence of the co - l@xmath9 xas and the x - ray magnetic circular dichroism spectrum ( xmcd ) below 500 kelvin .",
    "et al._@xcite observed a temperature dependence of the co k - edge prepeak between 140 kelvin and 800 kelvin and medarde _ at al._@xcite found that this temperature dependence sets in at 50 kelvin i.e. the onset of the spin state transition . + the nature of the spinful excited state which is responsible for the spin state transition has been under debate for some time . while it was proposed originally that this is the high spin ( hs ) @xmath10 ( or @xmath11 ) excited state of the co@xmath2 ion@xcite , korotin _",
    "et al._@xcite concluded from their lda+u calculation that this state rather is the intermediate spin ( is ) @xmath12 ( or @xmath13 ) state .",
    "recently , however , experimental evidence has accumulated@xcite that it is really the hs state which is populated .",
    "this leads to a certain puzzle in that a model calculation with an @xmath14 ground state and a @xmath10 excited state with fixed activation energy @xmath15 can not reproduce the experimental @xmath16 curve . if @xmath17 is adjusted so as to reproduce the temperature where @xmath3 starts to deviate from zero - @xmath18 50 kelvin - the resulting maximum value of @xmath16 near 100 kelvin exceeds the experimental value by a factor of @xmath19 .",
    "the fit is much better asuming an is excited state , which has led some authors@xcite to conclude that an is state is responsible for the transition .",
    "+ on the other hand , haverkort _ et al .",
    "_ pointed out@xcite that their xas and xmcd spectra can only be explained by admixture of a @xmath10 excited state and concluded that the activation energy @xmath20 is _ temperature dependent _ , rising from 20 mev at 50 k to 80 mev at 700 k@xcite and leading to a much slower increase of the population of hs ions with temperature .",
    "a somewhat puzzling feature of this scenario is that in a situation where the ground state is ls an increase of the activation energy implies an _ increase _ of the cef splitting @xmath21 with temperature .",
    "the increase@xcite of the co - o bond length - the most important parameter determining @xmath21 - with temperature , however , would result in exactly the opposite behaviour .",
    "the trend thus can not be explained in a single - ion - picture but is a kind of ` band effect ' .",
    "et al._@xcite , who deduced a very similar temperature dependence of the activation energy to reconcile magnetic susceptibility and specific heat data , invoked a negative energy of mixing between low spin and high spin ions . +",
    "another reason@xcite for the smaller - than - expected value of @xmath3 observed in experiment is spin - orbit coupling which splits the @xmath10 multiplet into three levels spanning an energy of @xmath22@xcite , which is large compared to the temperature where the spin state transition occurs .",
    "the lowest of these spin orbit - split states is threefold degenerate .",
    "this low energy triplet - itself slightly split by the trigonal distortion due to the orthorhombic crystal structure of lacoo@xmath0 - can be identified in electron spin resonance ( esr)@xcite and inelastic neutron scattering@xcite experiments , whereby its @xmath23-factor of @xmath24 is clear proof that it originates from a spin - orbit - split hs state rather than from an is state .",
    "+ haverkort _",
    "et al_@xcite also found that to fit their xas and xmcd spectra with cluster calculations they had to use a larger @xmath21 for the @xmath14 state than for the @xmath10 state .",
    "this hints at a participation of lattice degrees of freedom in that oxygen octahedra around hs co@xmath2 expand slightly so as to accomodate the somewhat larger radius of the hs ion .",
    "the emerging picture thus is a disordered mixture of ls and hs states , whereby the lattice participates by an expansion of the coo@xmath1 octahedra around hs sites@xcite , which would immediately explain the anomaly of the coefficient of thermal expansion@xcite . as pointed out by berggold",
    "_ et al._@xcite this idea also nicely explains an anomaly in the thermal conductivity @xmath25 of lacoo@xmath0 . at low temperatures the dominant contribution to @xmath25 comes from phonons and the expanded o@xmath1 octahedra around hs co",
    "constitute randomly distributed lattice imperfections which reduce the mean free path of the phonons .",
    "this leads to a decrease of @xmath25 at the onset of the spin state transition and a minimum slightly below 200 kelvin .",
    "+ the idea of expanded o@xmath1 octahedra around hs co ions may resolve yet another puzzle , namely the result from inelastic magnetic neutron scattering@xcite that low energy spin correlations in lacoo@xmath0 are ferromagnetic rather than antiferromagnetic .",
    "this is surprising in that the hs state has the configuration @xmath11 so that the goodenough - kanamori rules would predict strong antiferromagnetic exchange interaction between two hs co ions on nearest neighbors .",
    "the expansion of the oxygen octahedra around hs ions , however , would make the formation of hs states on nearest neighbor co ions energetically unfavourable , so that this antiferromagnetic nearest - neighbor exchange may never have the chance to act .",
    "the ferromagnetic spin correlations could then be due to ` semiconductor version ' of the double exchange mechanism@xcite .",
    "+ strong experimental evidence against any appreciable occupation of is states is also provided by the exafs results of sundaram _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "these authors ruled out the existence of inequivalent co - o bonds which would be practically inevitable in the presence of is states because the single electron in the two @xmath26 orbitals would make these strongly jahn - teller active .",
    "+ the second crossover in lacoo@xmath0 is frequently referred to as a metal - insulator - transition .",
    "it can be seen most clearly in the specific heat where the raw data of stlen _",
    "et al._@xcite show a sharp ` spike ' at 530 kelvin even before subtraction of the phonon background .",
    "surprisingly for a metal - insulator - transition the electrical conductivity @xmath27 does not seem to show any noticeable anomaly at this temperature .",
    "et al._@xcite found that at low temperatures the electrical conductivity @xmath27 shows a semiconductor - like increase with temperature which can be fitted well by assuming an activation energy of @xmath28 between 380 k and 520 k. there is a broad plateau between 600 k and 800 k and only above 800 kelvin @xmath27 decreases with temperature as in a metal .",
    "et al._@xcite fitted the temperature dependence of @xmath27 with an activation energy between 0.1 ev - 0.2ev for temperatures below 400 k. they found a plateau between 650 k and 1000 k and a decrease with temperature only above 1200 k. thornton _",
    "et al._@xcite inferred a ` high - order semiconductor - to - metal transition ' between 385 kelvin and 570 kelvin from a study of inflexion points in the @xmath27 versus @xmath29 plot .",
    "+ the magnetic susceptibility @xmath3 has a shallow maximum near 600 kelvin@xcite whereas magnetic neutron scattering@xcite does not show a pronounced signature of the transition .",
    "et al._@xcite found a significant change in the o1s xas spectra between 100 kelvin and 570 kelvin@xcite but the data of thornton _",
    "( xas at the co k - edge ) show a similar change as the o1s xas as the temperature changes from 140 to 300 kelvin so this change is not necessarily related to the metal - insulator - transition . tokura _",
    "_ observed the filling of a gap - like structure in the optical conductivity @xmath30 , richter _",
    "_ did not observe a fermi edge at temperatures above the crossover@xcite in their photoemission spectra .",
    "the evidence for a true metal - insulator - tansition thus is not really compelling and in fact stlen _",
    "et al._@xcite considered an entirely different scenario , where the splitting of the @xmath10 state by spin orbit coupling plays a central rule . in this scenario , the low temperature crossover is due to the thermal excitation of the low - energy triplet , whereas the ` metal - insulator - transition ' corresponds the population of the remaining components .",
    "+ it has been argued that the crystal structure of lacoo@xmath0 may play a role as well . in the lda+u calculations of korotin _",
    "et al._@xcite the structural change with increasing temperature is sufficient to induce a phase transition between magnetic and nonmagnetic ground states .",
    "quite generally density functional calculations show a strong sensitivity of ground state properties to structural parameters@xcite .",
    "an experimental result result which directly shows the importance of lattice degrees of the lattice structure for the magnetic state of the co@xmath2 ion is the ferromagnetism observed recently in lacoo@xmath0 thin films under tensile strain@xcite unlike bulk lacoo@xmath0 these thin films have temperature independent photoelectron spectra@xcite .",
    "+ lacoo@xmath0 clearly is a difficult problem for any kind of electronic structure calculation and has been studied by various methods during the last years : standard density functional thory@xcite , lda+u or gga+u@xcite and dynamical mean - field theory@xcite . as already mentioned",
    "lda band structure calculations incorrectly predict the material to be a metal in the paramagnetic state for both , the ideal perovskite structure and the true orthorombic structure@xcite .",
    "combined photoemission and bremsstrahlung isochromat spectroscopy ( bis ) data@xcite indicate a gap in the electronic structure although its precise magnitude is difficult to pin down because the bis spectrum shows a slow and almost linear increase of intensity with increasing energy . together with the satellite structures observed in valence band photoemission@xcite this indicates the importance of electronic correlations and suggests that at low temperature the material is actually a correlated insulator . from the above discussion",
    "it is moreover clear that a realistic description of the temperature dependence of the photoelectron spectra and magnetic susceptibility requires a correct description of the multiplet structure of the co@xmath2 ion , and its interplay with the crystalline electric field . on the other hand",
    "the relatively small gap indicates that covalency is strong so that band effects obviously are important as well .",
    "lacoo@xmath0 therefore appears as an interesting test case for the variational cluster approximation proposed by potthoff@xcite .",
    "this method generates trials self energies in a finite cluster - an octahedral coo@xmath1 cluster in the present implementation - so that the interplay between multiplet structure and crystal field splitting can be easily included .",
    "being based on exact diagonalization rather than quantum monte carlo the vca can access low temperatures as necessary for the case of lacoo@xmath0 . on the other hand ,",
    "the present implementation is based on an lcao - fit to the band structure whose necessarily limited accuracy makes it hard to quantitatively include the effects of changes of the lattice . therefore all calculations were carried out for a rigid lattice , which for simplicity was chosen to be the s.c .",
    "ideal perovskite structure .",
    "bearing in mind the scenario inferred by haverkort _",
    "et al . _ - an inhomogeneous lattice distortion with coo@xmath1 octahedra expanding or contracting _ locally _ in response to the spin state of the co - ion - it is quite obvious that a quantitative agreement with experiment can not be expected for any calculation for a rigid lattice . a quantitative discussion of the temperature dependence of @xmath3 moreover would require to include spin - orbit coupling which was omitted in the present study to simplify the calculations .",
    "bearing this in mind we may expect the present calculation , with a rigid lattice and no spin orbit coupling will reach at best qualitative agreement with experiment . as will be shown below",
    ", however , this goal is indeed achieved .",
    "the quantity which is subject to variation in the variational cluster approximation ( vca ) is the electronic self - energy @xmath31 .",
    "more precisely the vca seeks for the best approximation to the self - energy @xmath31 of a lattice system amongst the subset of self - energies which can be represented as exact self - energies of a given finite cluster .",
    "the vca is based on an expression for the grand potential @xmath32 of an interacting many - fermion system derived by luttinger and ward@xcite . in a multi - band system where the green s function @xmath33 , the noninteracting kinetic energy @xmath34 and the self - energy @xmath35 for given energy @xmath36 and momentum @xmath37 are matrices of dimension @xmath38 , with @xmath39 the number of orbitals in the unit cell , it reads@xcite @xmath40 \\label{ydef}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 with @xmath42 the inverse temperature are the fermionic matsubara frequencies , @xmath43 with @xmath44 the chemical potential and @xmath45 $ ] is the legendre transform of the luttinger - ward functional @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "the latter is defined@xcite as the sum of all closed linked skeleton diagrams with the non - interacting green s functions replaced by the full green s functions . a nonperturbative derivation of a functional with the same properties as @xmath47 has been given by potthoff@xcite . luttinger and ward",
    "have shown that @xmath32 is stationary with with respect to variations of @xmath48 : @xmath49 but the crucial obstacle in exploiting this stationarity property in a variational scheme for @xmath50 is the evaluation of the functional @xmath45 $ ] for a given ` trial @xmath50 ' .",
    "potthoff s solution@xcite makes use of the fact that @xmath45 $ ] has no explicit dependence on the single - particle terms of @xmath51 and therefore is the same functional of @xmath50 for any two systems with the _ same interaction part _ of the hamiltonian . in the following only the coulomb interaction within the @xmath52-shell",
    "is taken into account - which is a reasonable approximation . under this assumption",
    "@xmath45 $ ] then is the same functional for the true perovskite lattice and for an array of identical but disconnected octahedral coo@xmath1 clusters .",
    "for given value of @xmath44 and @xmath42 one can therefore construct trial self - energies @xmath53 by exact diagonalization of a single coo@xmath1 cluster and at the same time obtain the exact numerical value of @xmath45 $ ] by simply reverting the expression ( [ ydef ] ) . here the kinetic energy @xmath54 of the coo@xmath1 cluster has to be used in the dyson equation ( [ gdef ] ) .",

    "the variation of @xmath53 then is performed by varying the single - electron parameters @xmath56 - such as hybridization integrals or site - energies - of the coo@xmath1 cluster .",

    "it is likely that the reason is the rigid lattice used in the present calculation : in the actual material the expansion of the o@xmath1 octahedra around a co - ion in the high - spin state probably prevents hs ions from occupying nearest neighbors , so that the strong antiferromagnetic superexchange can not act . in the vca calculation",

    "to summarize one may say that the vca gives a reasonably accurate description of some experimental results for lacoo@xmath0 .",
    "the insulating nature of the material is described correctly and the photoelectron spectra agree with experiment in quite some detail .",
    "the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility and the photoelectron spectra is reproduced at least qualitatively .",
    "for all temperatures studied only ls and hs states have appreciable weight in the density matrix of the reference system , which means that the vca is consistent with the ls - hs scenario supported by experiment .",
    "thereby the population of the hs states increases quite smoothly with an onset at 50 kelvin which would be consistent with experiment as well .",
    "+ the main deficiencies are the failure to reproduce the crossover seen at 530 kelvin in the entropy and susceptibility , the too small value of the magnetic susceptibility and the too slow increase of the hs population with temperature , which makes the temperature dependence of all photoelectron spectra weaker than observed .",
    "it should be noted that changing the values of @xmath17 and/or @xmath97 so as to obtain e.g. a smaller insulating gap does not change this .",
    "the above deficiencies are very probably not related to an inappropriate choice of parameters .",
    "+ the first reason for deviations is probably the neglect of spin - orbit - coupling in the @xmath78-shell .",
    "this leads to a splitting of the @xmath10 state into a three - fold , a five - fold and a seven - fold degenerate state@xcite which span an energy of @xmath164 .",
    "if one were to assume that the activation energy in the reference system as obtained by the vca corresponds to the center of gravity of these split states , the triplet would be appreciably lower and give a higher susceptibility and hs occupation at low temperatures .",
    "moreover , stlen _ et al._@xcite have considered a scenario , where the low temperature crossover corresponds to the population of the low energy triplet and the high temperature transition to the population of the remaining two components .",
    "if that were indeed the case , a calculation without spin orbit coupling could never reproduce the high temperature transition .",
    "since spin - orbit coupling is a single - particle term it can be included into the vca without any problem .",
    "on the other hand the z - component of the spin is no longer a good quantum number if spin - orbit - coupling is introduced , which increases the size of matrices to be diagonalized or inverted and spin - orbit coupling was neglected in the present study .",
    "+ a second reason is the neglect of - or rather : the impossibility to treat - the local lattice relaxations i.e. the expansion of o@xmath1 octahedra around hs co ions .",
    "this implies than a hs ion ` feels ' a different environment and that the actual activation energy has to be modified by an elastic contribution .",
    "all of these effects are missed in a calculation with a rigid lattice like the present one .",
    "the local expansion of the o@xmath1 octahedra may also have considerable impact on the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "namely based on the goodenough - kanamori rules hs ions on nearest neighbors would be expected to show strong antiferromagnetic exchange via the two half - filled @xmath26 orbitals . on the other hand , for hs ions on nearest neighbors",
    "it is clear that the respective local lattice relaxations - expansion of the o@xmath1 octahedra around hs ions - would interfere with each other , so that hs occupation of nearest neighbors may be energetically unfavourable and the antiferromagnetic superexchange may simply not have the chance to act .",
    "this could explain the experimental result@xcite that low energy spin correlations are ferromagnetic rather than antiferromagnetic as well as the surprising fact that thin films of lacoo@xmath0 under tensile order ferromagnetically@xcite . in a calculation with a rigid lattice this effect would be missed , so that the antiferromagnetic superexchange would reduce the spin susceptibility .",
    "+ this shows that important physical effects had to be neglected in the present calculation and a quantitative agreement with experiment could not be expected .",
    "still there is quite good qualitative agreement which demonstrates the usefulness of the vca to study correlated insulators .",
    "+ i would like to thank k. p. bohnen , d. fuchs , m. haverkort , m. potthoff and s. schuppler for instructive discussions .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility can be obtained from @xmath165 .",
    "thereby the magnetic field @xmath166 is an additional single - particle - like parameter in the physical system .",
    "the introduction of this parameter will change the stationary point , that means the parameters of the reference system become depedent on @xmath166 . for the calculation of the derivative ,",
    "however , we do not need to solve the optimization with applied @xmath166-field . + we denote by @xmath56 the parameters of the reference system and by @xmath167 the values at the stationary point for @xmath168",
    ". then we can write down the following expansion of @xmath32 for small @xmath166 : @xmath169 all derivatives in this equation can in principle be obtained numerically .",
    "also it has been used that in a paramagnetic state @xmath170 taking @xmath166 small but finite and demanding that @xmath171 we obtain @xmath172 we now differentiate with respect to @xmath166 and set @xmath168 to obtain @xmath173 which is an equation for the derivatives @xmath174 .",
    "we assume this to be solved and thus the @xmath174 to be known .",
    "inserting now @xmath175 into equation ( [ eq1 ] ) we obtain @xmath176 \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] from which the susceptibility is found as @xmath177 in the presence of a magnetic field all single electron parameters of the reference system have to be taken spin dependent , i.e. a hopping integral @xmath178 .",
    "it is then easy to see that the mixed second derivatives @xmath179 are different from zero only for those @xmath56 which are odd under sign change of the spin , that means quantities like @xmath180 . at a nonmagnetic sp",

    "<S> the variational cluster approximation is applied to the calculation of thermodynamical quantities and single - particle spectra of lacoo@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> trial self - energies and the numerical value of the luttinger - ward functional are obtained by exact diagonalization of a coo@xmath1 cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the vca correctly predicts lacoo@xmath0 as a paramagnetic insulator and a gradual and relatively smooth increase of the occupation of high - spin co@xmath2 ions causes the temperature dependence of entropy and magnetic susceptibility . </S>",
    "<S> the single particle spectral function agrees well with experiment , the experimentally observed temperature dependence of photoelectron spectra is reproduced satisfactorily . </S>",
    "<S> remaining discrepancies with experiment highlight the importance of spin orbit coupling and local lattice relaxation . </S>"
