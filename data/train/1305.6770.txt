    "despite its remarkable successes , the standard @xmath2cdm ( @xmath2 cold dark matter ) cosmological model faces severe theoretical , interpretational and observational challenges .",
    "the most important of these is the explanation of the late accelerated expansion of the universe , inferred from observations of the expansionary evolution of type ia supernovae @xcite .",
    "combined with the recent cosmic microwave background observations of the planck satellite , @xcite , astronomical and astrophysical data provide compelling evidence that our universe is dominated by a mysterious and exotic component , whose properties are difficult to be understood in the framework of our present day knowledge . indeed , the standard model of cosmology has favored a missing energy - momentum component , in particular , the dark energy models .",
    "this exotic component can be interpreted theoretically either by assuming that it is a cosmological constant , which would represent an intrinsic curvature of space - time , or a vacuum energy .",
    "alternatively , the dominant component of the universe can be seen as a dark energy , which would mimic a cosmological constant .",
    "one of main dark energy scenarios is based on the so - called quintessence , where dark energy corresponds to a dynamical scalar field @xmath3 @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the possibility that general relativity breaks down at cosmological scales can not be ruled out _ a priori _ , and the late - time cosmic acceleration may be due to infra - red modifications of general relativity .",
    "therefore , a second possibility in explaining the observational data is to assume that at large scales the nature of the gravitational interaction is modified , and a new theoretical model of gravity is necessary in order to understand , and interpret , the observational data .",
    "several , essentially geometric , modifications of standard general relativity have been considered , and investigated in detail as alternatives to dark energy . in particular , the @xmath4 type models @xcite , where @xmath5 is the ricci scalar , @xmath6 models with geometry - matter coupling coupl , where @xmath7 is the matter lagrangian , @xmath8 models @xcite , where @xmath9 is the trace of the energy - momentum tensor , weyl - cartan - weitzenbck gravity @xcite , hybrid metric - palatini @xmath10-gravity models @xcite , or the recently proposed @xmath11 gravity frtt , where @xmath12 is the ricci tensor , and @xmath13 is the matter energy - momentum tensor , are some of the proposed geometric modifications of general relativity that can explain the late de sitter type expansionary phase in the evolution of the universe .    in the context of modified theories of gravity , based on the classic work of eddington @xcite , and on the non - linear electrodynamics of born and infeld",
    "@xcite , an interesting extension of general relativity was introduced in @xcite , and further developed in @xcite .",
    "essentially , in this model , denoted eddington - inspired born - infeld gravity ( eibi ) , the eddington action is coupled to matter without insisting on a purely affine action , or on a theory equivalent to einstein gravity .",
    "the metric is present in the model , and the gravitational action has a born - infeld like structure .",
    "the model is based on a palatini - type formulation , with the metric tensor @xmath14 and the connection @xmath15 are varied independently . in this model ,",
    "the newton - poisson equation is modified in the presence of matter sources , and the charged black holes are similar with those arising in born - infeld electrodynamics coupled to gravity .",
    "the cosmological solutions of the model for homogeneous and isotropic space - times show that there is a minimum length ( and maximum density ) at early times , indicating the possibility of an alternative theory of the big bang @xcite . for a positive coupling parameter ,",
    "the field equations have an important impact on the collapse of dust , and do not lead to singularities @xcite .",
    "the theory supports stable , compact pressureless stars made of perfect fluid , and the existence of relativistic stars imposes a strong , near optimal constraint on the coupling parameter .",
    "this constraint can be improved by observations of the moment of inertia of double pulsars .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the eibi theory coupled to a perfect fluid reduces to general relativity coupled to a nonlinearly modified perfect fluid , leading to an ambiguity between the modified coupling and the modified equation of state .",
    "the observational consequences of this degeneracy were discussed , and it was argued that this extension of general relativity is viable from both an experimental and theoretical point of view through the energy conditions , consistency , and singularity - avoidance perspectives @xcite . however , in @xcite it was shown that the eibi theory , which is reminiscent of palatini @xmath4 gravity , shares the same pathologies , such as curvature singularities at the surface of polytropic stars and unacceptable newtonian limit . the singularity avoidance in eibi gravity was analyzed in @xcite , by considering the behavior of a homogeneous and isotropic universe filled with phantom energy in addition to the dark and baryonic matter . unlike the big bang singularity that can be avoided in this kind of model ,",
    "the big rip singularity is unavoidable in the eibi phantom model .",
    "the dark matter density profile in eibi gravity was also considered in @xcite , and it was found that in this model the dark matter density distribution is described by the lane - emden equation with a polytropic index @xmath16 , and is non - singular at the galactic center .",
    "the tensor perturbations of a homogeneous and isotropic space - time in the eddington regime , where modifications to einstein gravity are strong were analyzed , and it was found that the tensor mode is linearly unstable deep in the eddington regime escamillarivera:2012vz .",
    "furthermore , it was also argued that eibi cosmologies may present viable alternatives to the inflationary paradigm as a solution to fundamental problems of the standard cosmological model , and that under specific assumptions the model is free from tensor singularities @xcite .",
    "other cosmological and astrophysical aspects of the eibi model were considered in @xcite .    in an astrophysical context",
    ", the hydrostatic equilibrium structure of compact stars in the eibi gravity was explored in @xcite , and a framework to study the radial perturbations and stability of compact stars in this theory was also developed .",
    "the standard results of stellar stability still hold in the eibi theory , with the frequency square of the fundamental oscillation mode vanishing for the maximum - mass stellar configuration .",
    "the dependence of the oscillation mode frequencies on the coupling parameter @xmath17 of the theory was also investigated .",
    "the fundamental mode is insensitive to the value of the coupling constant , while higher order modes depend more strongly on it .",
    "however , generic phase transitions taking place in compact stars constructed in the framework of the eibi gravity can lead to anomalous behavior of these stars @xcite . in the case of first - order phase transitions , compact stars in eibi gravity with a positive coupling parameter @xmath18",
    "possess a constant pressure finite region , which is not present in general relativistic stars .",
    "for the case of a negative @xmath18 , an equilibrium stellar configuration can not be realized .",
    "hence , in eibi gravity there are stricter constraints on the microphysics of the stellar matter .",
    "besides , in the presence of spatial discontinuities in the speed of sound due to phase transitions , the ricci scalar is spatially discontinuous , and contains delta - function singularities , proportional to the jump in the speed of sound @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to investigate the properties of relativistic compact stars in the eibi model . by assuming a spherically symmetric perfect fluid matter ,",
    "the gravitational field equations of the eibi model are solved numerically with several prescribed equations of state . as specific examples of stellar models we consider stars described by the causal stiff fluid equation of state , for which the speed of sound equals the speed of light ; the radiation - type equation of state , for which the trace of the energy - momentum tensor is zero ; the degenerate relativistic neutron matter equation of state , representing a polytrope of index @xmath19 ; and the quark matter equation of state .",
    "for all these models the global astrophysical parameters of the stars ( radius and mass ) are obtained in both standard general relativity and in the eibi gravity model , thus allowing a detailed comparison of the two approaches to stellar structure . as a general result of our study",
    "it follows that eibi gravity allows the existence of more massive stars , as compared to general relativity .",
    "we also obtain an exact stellar model solution , corresponding to an equation of state of the form @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the energy density and isotropic pressure , respectively .",
    "this model corresponds to an `` exotic '' eibi stellar - type object , with decreasing pressure , but increasing energy density .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "the eibi gravity theory is briefly presented in section [ sect2 ] .",
    "the system of gravitational field equations describing the star interior ( mass continuity and hydrostatic equilibrium equations ) is derived in section  [ sect3 ] .",
    "stellar models described by the stiff fluid , radiation , polytropic and mit bag model equations of state are studied numerically , in both eibi model and standard general relativity , in section  [ sect4 ] .",
    "an exact `` exotic '' stellar model is obtained in section  [ sect5 ] .",
    "finally , we discuss and conclude our results in section  [ sect6 ] .",

    ", the action ( [ 1c ] ) recovers the einstein - hilbert action with @xmath35 . in the present paper",
    ", we consider only asymptotic flat solutions , and hence we take @xmath36 . therefore the cosmological constant vanishes , and the remaining parameter @xmath18 plays the fundamental role for describing the physical behavior of various cosmological and stellar scenarios .",
    "several constraints on the value and the sign of the parameter @xmath37 have been obtained from solar observations , big bang nucleosynthesis , and the existence of neutron stars in @xcite . in particular , for cases with positive @xmath18 , effective gravitational repulsion prevails , leading to the existence of pressureless stars ( stars made of non - interacting particles which provide interesting models for self - gravitating dark matter @xcite ) and to an increase in the mass limits of compact stars @xcite .",
    "note that in the eibi theory the metric @xmath32 and the connection @xmath27 are treated as independent fields .",
    "variation of the action ( [ 1c ] ) leads to the following results @xcite : @xmath38where @xmath39 is an auxiliary metric , @xmath40 and we have denoted @xmath41 as @xmath42 .    in the eibi model ,",

    "the predictions of these two theoretical models do agree , but important quantitative differences also appear .",
    "an important and interesting feature of eibi gravity is that it predicts more massive objects than general relativity , with an equation of state dependent increase in the stellar mass in the range of 22%-26% . in the analysis outlined in this work ,",
    "we have also restricted our study to positive values of the parameter @xmath275 , since only in this case more massive stellar configurations than the general relativistic ones are possible . by assuming a linear equation of state of the form @xmath276",
    ", we have also obtained the complete exact analytical solution of the gravitational field equations describing the interior of an `` exotic '' star in eibi gravity . in the limit of large parameter @xmath252 , the obtained solution describes the string gas stellar model , with the equation of state of the form @xmath277 @xcite .",
    "note that a short review on the building blocks of the string gas cosmological model has been recently presented in @xcite .",
    "one of the fundamental property of stellar models is their stability with respect to small perturbations .",
    "the stability of eibi compact stars was considered in @xcite , where it was shown that the standard results of stellar stability theory still hold in this theory . for the maximum - mass stellar configuration",
    "the frequency square of the fundamental oscillation mode vanishes .",
    "however , an interesting difference with respect to general relativity is that the criterion @xmath278 does not guarantee stability .    a very intriguing type of astrophysical objects are stellar mass black holes , with masses in the range of @xmath279 .",
    "the stellar mass black holes have been observed in close binary systems , in which transfer of matter from a companion star to the black hole occurs .",
    "the energy released in the fall heats up the matter to temperatures of several hundred million degrees , and it is radiated in @xmath280-rays , thus allowing the detection of the black hole , whereas the companion star can be observed with optical telescopes .",
    "it is estimated that in the milky way alone there should be at least 1000 dormant black hole @xmath280 ray transients , while the total number of stellar mass black holes ( isolated and in binaries ) could be as large as 100 million @xcite .",
    "since ordinary neutron or quark stars in eibi gravity can acquire larger masses than the general relativistic maximum mass of @xmath281 , stellar mass black holes , with masses in the range of @xmath282 and @xmath283 , respectively , could in fact be eibi neutron or quark stars .",
    "eibi stars can achieve much higher masses than standard neutron stars , thus making them possible stellar mass black hole candidates .",

    "<S> we consider the structure and physical properties of specific classes of neutron , quark and `` exotic '' stars in eddington - inspired born - infeld ( eibi ) gravity . </S>",
    "<S> the latter reduces to standard general relativity in vacuum , but presents a different behavior of the gravitational field in the presence of matter . </S>",
    "<S> the equilibrium equations for a spherically symmetric configuration ( mass continuity and tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ) are derived , and their solutions are obtained numerically for different equations of state of neutron and quark matter . more specifically , stellar models , described by the stiff fluid , radiation - like , polytropic and the bag model quark equations of state are explicitly constructed in both general relativity and eibi gravity , thus allowing a comparison between the predictions of these two gravitational models . as a general result it turns out that for all the considered equations of state , eibi gravity stars are more massive than their general relativistic counterparts . furthermore , an exact solution of the spherically symmetric field equations in eibi gravity , describing an `` exotic '' star , with decreasing pressure but increasing energy density , is also obtained . as a possible astrophysical application of the obtained results we suggest that stellar mass black holes , with masses in the range of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , could be in fact eibi neutron or quark stars . </S>"
