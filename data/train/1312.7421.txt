    "it was shown that couples of @xmath1-bands and higher - energy ( non - yrast ) negative - parity bands can be interpreted within the model framework in the same way as the yrast alternating - parity bands . on this basis",
    "it was concluded that the octupole degrees of freedom have a persistent role at higher energies and the quadrupole - octupole structure of the spectrum develops towards the non - yrast region of collective excitations @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to examine the capability of the cqom model scheme to describe non - yrast quadrupole - octupole excitations in odd - mass nuclei by extending the original consideration proposed in @xcite .",
    "for this reason it is assumed that some non - yrast level sequences with positive and negative parities observed in these nuclei can be associated to a higher - energy quasi parity - doublet structure of the spectrum .",
    "it is supposed that such a structure can appear as the manifestation of higher - energy quadrupole - octupole rotation - vibration modes coupled to the single - particle motion .",
    "the coupling of the odd nucleon to the even - even nuclear core as well as the coriolis interaction are taken into account phenomenologically . at the same time",
    "the implemented approach is supposed to pave the way for a subsequent microscopic treatment of the odd - nucleon degrees of freedom . in this meaning the present work may be considered a necessary step towards a deeper understanding of the mechanism which governs the evolution of quadrupole - octupole dynamics in the higher - energy part of the spectrum in odd - mass nuclei .",

    "this leads to a respective inversion of the parity @xmath58 of the vibration state at the given angular momentum and to a subsequent inversion of the mutual disposition of the parity - doublet counterparts , up - down @xmath59 down - up .",
    "such a situation is indeed observed in few cases and described by the model ( see next section ) .    in the original application of the model to the yrast octupole spectra",
    "it was considered that for a given @xmath24 the nucleus always takes the lowest quadrupole - octupole vibration states with angular phonon numbers @xmath60 or @xmath61 depending on the parity @xcite .",
    "the generalization of the model description by including non - yrast alternating - parity spectra of even - even nuclei showed that a better agreement with the experimental data can be obtained if higher @xmath62-values are also allowed @xcite .",
    "it was seen that the difference @xmath63 reasonably specifies the mutual disposition of the opposite - parity sequences in the spectrum .",
    "therefore , it can be expected that the same meaning of the higher @xmath26-values will be valid for the parity - shift in the quasi - doublet bands of odd - mass nuclei . on the other hand , as recognized in @xcite , in this case one has jumps of the quantum numbers @xmath64 and @xmath65 over several low - lying angular - phonon excitations within the set of levels characterized by given radial - phonon number @xmath24 .",
    "presently this is only justified by the meaning of @xmath66 as a characteristics of the mutual displacement of the opposite - parity sequences .",
    "the search for a deeper meaning and more sophisticated correlation between the quadrupole and octupole modes capable to compensate or explain these jumps is still an open issue . in this work",
    "we apply the original concept for the lowest @xmath67 or @xmath61 phonon numbers in the model description of yrast and non - yrast quasi parity - doublet spectra of odd-@xmath0 nuclei . at the same time in the end of the next section we discuss the difference between the obtained results and the result of calculations performed for the same nuclei by allowing higher @xmath65 values for the upper shifted doublet counterparts and fixed @xmath68 value for the counterparts whose parity coincides with the bandhead parity . for this reason we keep the formalism in its general form capable of treating unrestricted values of angular - phonon numbers .    by using the wave functions ( [ spwf ] )",
    "one can calculate b(e@xmath69 ) transition probabilities ( @xmath70 ) in the yrast and non - yrast quasi - doublet spectra .",
    "the relevant formalism was originally developed in @xcite and further extended to the non - yrast states of even - even nuclei @xcite . in this work",
    "we apply the formalism developed in @xcite . due to the imposed axial symmetry the b(e@xmath69 )",
    "probabilities are non - zero only between states with the same @xmath14-values .",

    "the consideration of transition probabilities between states belonging to different parity - doublets , and with @xmath88 , can be implemented after obtaining @xmath43 within the reflection - asymmetric deformed shell model ( dsm ) @xcite as done in @xcite and by taking into account the coriolis @xmath14-mixing effect in the respective s.p .",

    "such a task implies a natural connection of the collective cqom model to an approach in which the ground state , the excited q.p . states , the respective decoupling factors ( for @xmath16 ) , as well as the coriolis mixing contributions are obtained microscopically .",

    "we consider that the knowledge of the pure collective cqom description of quadrupole - octupole spectra , especially the yrast and non - yrast quasi - doublet levels , is a necessary step before attempting detailed implementation of the microscopic part of the approach .",

    ", essentially lower energy rms factors were obtained in : @xmath103ra with `` favored '' @xmath191 and @xmath192 values and rms@xmath108=7 kev ; @xmath104np with @xmath191 and @xmath193 and rms@xmath194=15 kev ; @xmath105am with @xmath191 and @xmath192 with rms@xmath108=18 kev .",
    "it is seen that in these nuclei the rms@xmath108 values obtained at @xmath188 are smaller than the values ( given in figs . 2 and 3 ) obtained for @xmath195 by a factor between 2 and 3 .",

    "the conclusion from the above mentioned calculations is that indeed the involvement of larger numbers of angular phonons leads to better model descriptions .",

    "[ f1]-[f3 ] shows that the imposing of the lowest quadrupole - octupole vibration modes with @xmath68 and @xmath117 still provides quite adequate interpretation and classification of the yrast and first non - yrast quasi - doublet energy sequences in the considered odd - mass nuclei .",
    "this means that the cqom model is capable of reproducing the specific spectroscopic properties related to the simultaneous manifestation of quadrupole and octupole degrees of freedom in these nuclei .",
    "the use of the model with larger angular - phonon numbers can extend its applicability in wider regions of nuclei and quasi - doublet spectra , including higher non - yrast bands , but needs a detailed justification of the presence of lower model states for which experimental data are not observed .",
    "it should be noted that even on the present level of phenomenology , the cqom model description provides a useful basis for further developments . as it was discussed in the end of sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] the knowledge of the decoupling factors as well as the model mechanism for the forming of parity - doublet spectra in odd - mass nuclei can guide the inclusion of microscopic calculations in the study .",
    "in conclusion , the present work reports an application of the collective model of coherent quadrupole and octupole motion ( cqom ) for the description of yrast and non - yrast quasi - doublet spectra in odd - mass nuclei .",
    "the calculations are performed by considering a zero number of radial quadrupole - octupole phonons in the yrast band and one radial - phonon excitation in the first non - yrast band . in both bands",
    "the lowest possible angular - phonon modes in the motion of the even - even core are considered .",
    "the results obtained for a number of odd - mass nuclei in the rare - earth and actinide regions illustrate the capability of the model to reproduce the structure of yrast and non - yrast energy levels together with the attendant b(e1 ) and b(e2 ) transition probabilities .",
    "the test of the model by allowing a higher number of angular phonons shows a better agreement with the experimental data , but still needs a justification of the jumps over the lower phonon numbers . at the same time the collective rotation - vibration structure of the spectra and the observed coriolis decoupling effects are adequately taken into account . on this basis",
    "the present cqom model descriptions can serve as a starting point for the application of a deeper collective and microscopic approach in the exploration of nuclear quadrupole - octupole collectivity .",
    "work in this direction is in progress ."
