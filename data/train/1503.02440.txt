    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](a ) and ( c ) show arpes data sets along the @xmath1-direction for 20  ml and 22  ml , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> corresponding second derivative images are presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](b ) and ( d ) . </S>",
    "<S> the second derivative procedure was performed by convoluting the raw data sets with the second derivative of a two - dimensional gaussian with fwhm of 25  mev and 0.047  @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental data allow us to identify up to five qws [ arrows in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](a ) ] with dispersion relations that are reasonably well approximated by free electron parabolas with positive effective masses on the order of 12  @xmath17 . fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3].(e ) and ( f ) show an arpes data set along the @xmath2-direction and the corresponding second derivative image , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> it is clearly evident that along @xmath2 the qws do not behave as free electrons but rather form flat heavy bands . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the dispersion along @xmath2 vanishes within the experimental uncertainty over a comparably large @xmath14-range ; the estimated lower limit for the effective mass of the qws closest to @xmath16 is @xmath050@xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> this value is comparable to heavy quasi - particle bands observed by arpes in strongly correlated @xmath18 and @xmath19 compounds @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is also worth noting that the binding energy and the spectral linewidth of the state closest to @xmath16 are on the order of only @xmath010  mev . </S>",
    "<S> this actually is the typical energy scale on which different many - body effects influence the electronic structure , e.g. the kondo effect @xcite , superconductivity @xcite and electron - phonon renormalization of the band mass @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is well - known that electronic states in surface and thin film systems can be strongly influenced by the structural properties parallel to the interface plane @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a prominent example are surface states on vicinal metal surfaces that acquire a quasi - one - dimensional character due to the additional lateral confinement induced by regular arrays of step edges @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one may therefore suspect a similar structural origin for the large electronic anisotropy observed in the present case for fe / w(110 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , we could rule out any effect of a possible miscut of the substrate by reproducing our experimental results on different w(110 ) single crystals . furthermore , we observed sharp and isotropic leed spots that provided no indication for the formation of a superstructure within the films , but rather gave evidence for a well - ordered ( 110)-surface without reconstructions ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore identify the observed anisotropy as an intrinsic property of the fe layers on w(110 ) .            </S>",
    "<S> we will now address manifestations of the large anisotropy in the fermi surface . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4].(a ) shows the experimental fermi surface close to the @xmath15-point for 22  ml fe / w(110 ) as determined by arpes . </S>",
    "<S> the data show the presence of a diamond - shaped outer structure and an additional inner fine structure which could not be observed in previous arpes experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the fine structure consists of parallel , almost straight lines along @xmath2 in accordance with the vanishing dispersion observed for this direction . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results are compared to the calculated fermi surface of a free - standing fe layer displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4].(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is evident that the very characteristic fine structure visible in our arpes data is remarkably well reproduced by the gga calculation : the main diamond - shaped structure is indeed clearly present in the minority - spin gga data and the characteristic lines parallel to @xmath2 with a weak convex deformation also show up in the theory . </S>",
    "<S> even the slight concave inwards bending of the two inner features parallel to @xmath2 are qualitatively reflected in the calculation ( arrows in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> let us note that the experimental spectral weight at the fermi surface is suppressed outside the diamond structure whereas the gga calculation does not give a clearcut difference between the states inside and outside the diamond shape . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the best match to the experimental data was achieved for a film thickness of 20  ml , slightly deviating from the experimental value of 22  ml . </S>",
    "<S> this difference possibly originates from the absence of a substrate in the calculation of the fermi surface in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of the substrate in the theoretical calculation is feasible , though only when assuming a commensurate lattice parameter for w and fe . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the presence of a substrate makes the comparison with experiment rather difficult , since the calculated fermi surface contains substrate contributions that are suppressed in the experimental data due to the small electron escape depth .    even if the gga - fermi surface map without inclusion of substrate matches the measured one in even details , a comparison of the calculated and measured band structure is more difficult . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated band structure along the @xmath1-direction yields a large number of parabolic bands in reasonable agreement with experiment ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5].(a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the position of the main features at @xmath15 varies a lot with the number of layers or with the inclusion of the w substrate . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen more clearly in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5].(b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) , where we show the band structure along the @xmath2-direction for 20 ml fe , 22 ml fe and 20 ml fe / w . apparently , </S>",
    "<S> the strong , nearly parabolic feature is not much affected by the number of layers in the calculations . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the position of the flat bands is extremely sensitive to the structural details . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a sequence of weakly dispersive parabolic majority bands with negative curvature in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] ( three such ( blue ) bands for 20-layers , but only two bands are visible in this energy range for 22-layers ) , whose position as well as whose separation depend on the layer thickness . </S>",
    "<S> a similar situation occurs for the fairly dispersionless minority bands ( black ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the gga for a free - standing film ( or even grown on a `` compressed '' w substrate ) yields a qualitatively correct picture of the bands , but fails to fully reproduce their exact energy position and spacing . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , it is almost impossible to simulate the true change in the atomic structure across the interface with present computer resources . </S>",
    "<S> w has a much larger lattice parameter than fe which has to induce a complicated dislocation pattern leading to the incommensurate structure observed experimentally and could only be simulated using very large supercells . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason we can not get a quantitative agreement of the whole band structure . </S>",
    "<S> the sensitivity of the gga band structure to the number of layers , to the presence of the w(110 ) substrate and to the underlying commensurate lattice parameter is indeed a clear indication that the substrate plays a role in determining the details of the experimentally observed electronic structure .    </S>",
    "<S> -direction in ( a ) , for a 20  ml film along @xmath20 in ( b ) , for a 22  ml film along @xmath20 in ( c ) , and for a 20  ml film along @xmath20 on w in ( d ) . </S>",
    "<S> the size of the circles indicates the amount of fe surface and sub - surface character , the horizontal axis is labeled in @xmath9 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the above analysis points to a substantial interaction between the qws in the fe film with the w(110 ) substrate . </S>",
    "<S> microscopically this interaction is caused by the hybridization of film and substrate states giving rise to a considerable extension of the qws wave functions into the substrate @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the wave functions are therefore partially exposed to the potential landscape of the substrate which apparently promotes a further enhancement of the anisotropy in the dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> a recent arpes investigation reports a highly anisotropic dispersion for a surface state on bare w(110 ) that , similar to the qws in the present study , shows a steep ( flat ) dispersion along the @xmath2-direction ( @xmath1-direction ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the w(110 ) surface thus indeed appears to be prone to induce pronounced electronic anisotropies .    </S>",
    "<S> to the best of our knowledge no previous work has reported a comparably large electronic anisotropy for a homogeneous film so far . </S>",
    "<S> the present observations for fe / w(110 ) are comparable to findings for nanowire reconstructions on semiconducting substrates or stepped metal surfaces with geometric structures exhibiting a one - dimensional character @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest approximation for a 2deg yields an isotropic dispersion characterized by an effective mass @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> deviations from this basic scenario in real systems are more or less severe depending on the symmetry of the crystal lattice and the orbital character of the involved states . comparably weak or even undetectable anisotropies </S>",
    "<S> are typically found for @xmath22-type surface or quantum well states in systems with @xmath23-symmetry , such as e.g. cu(111 ) @xcite , bi@xmath24se@xmath25(0001 ) @xcite or ag / si(111 ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , lowering the spatial symmetry and going to more directional orbitals can drastically enhance the anisotropy of band dispersions as demonstrated in ref .   for the @xmath26-type surface state on w(110 ) with @xmath27-symmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> our measurements directly image the quantized band structure and fermi surface of ferromagnetic fe films on a small energy scale . </S>",
    "<S> the energy separation of the observed qws is @xmath050  mev and thus of the same order as temperature - induced broadening effects at @xmath16 at room temperature ( 4@xmath28  100  mev ) . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic quantum size effects originating from such closely spaced qws are expected to become significantly damped when approaching room temperature because the discrete character of the near-@xmath16 electronic structure becomes washed out @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> oscillations in the magnetic anisotropy in the system fe / ag(1,1,10 ) were indeed found to vanish above 200  k and our results , though not directly comparable due to the different substrate material , provide an important hint on the origin of this observation @xcite . as a strategy to enhance the energy spacing a possibility is to go to lower films thicknesses or to use different ferromagnetic materials @xcite .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> the presented arpes experiments reveal a quantized electronic fine structure close to the fermi energy of 44.5  nm fe(110 ) films being relevant for making use of quantum magnetic size effects in metallic multilayers . </S>",
    "<S> the observed qws appear on a low energy scale in the mev regime indicating that quantization effects in ferromagnetic layers can occur on the same energy scale as classical many - body phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> the observed qws do not follow a simple free - electron behavior but rather exhibit a strong anisotropy in their dispersion within the surface plane . their effective mass changes by a factor of @xmath050 between the @xmath1- and @xmath2-directions . </S>",
    "<S> density functional theory calculations largely agree with the experimental findings . based on our theoretical results </S>",
    "<S> we attribute the strong electronic anisotropy both to the intrinsic electronic structure of _ bcc _ fe and to extrinsic influences caused by coupling to the w(110 ) substrate . </S>"
