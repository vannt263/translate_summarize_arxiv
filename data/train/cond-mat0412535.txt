    "soft matter systems are characterised by the simultaneous existence of two intrinsic structural length scales : the omnipresent atomic or _",
    "microscopic _ scale that is associated with the solvent molecules and the monomers of the dissolved polymers ( if any ) and the _ mesoscopic _ scale that characterises the dissolved macromolecular aggregates as a whole .",
    "depending on the physical system under consideration , the latter typically covers the range between several nanometers and micrometers , spanning thereby three orders of magnitude .",
    "the former is rather located in the domain of a few ngstrm . in attempting to bridge the scales all the way from the microscopic to the macroscopic ones",
    ", it has been proven very useful to eliminate the atomic degrees of freedom from view , by performing a statistical - mechanical trace over their degrees of freedom and constructing thereby an _ effective hamiltonian _ that involves the mesoscopic degrees of freedom only @xcite .",
    "although the effective hamiltonian @xmath0 greatly facilitates the transition to the macroscopic scales , both its construction and its interpretation have to be treated with care : indeed , the effective potential energy function that involves the mesoscopic degrees of freedom which appear in @xmath0 are not true interaction potentials in the sense of hamiltonian mechanics but rather a constrained free energy which arises by the thermodynamic trace of the microscopic ones .",
    "there is a number of subtleties associated with the effective potential energy function that have to be taken into account when a coarse - grained statistical mechanical treatment of a soft matter system is employed .",
    "two of them are particularly relevant in the context of calculating thermodynamic quantities and tracing out phase diagrams .",
    "first , the potential energy can not , in general , be written as a sum of pair interactions :- th order polymer - mediated effective interactions between colloids vanish identically for @xmath1 if the polymer - to - colloid size ratio does not exceed @xmath2 .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for details . ]",
    "the process of eliminating the microscopic degrees of freedom inadvertently generates higher - order , many - body potentials @xcite .",
    "truncating the effective potential energy function at the pair - level constitutes the _ pair potential approximation _ , whose validity is not _ a priori _ guaranteed and has to be explicitly checked . and secondly , that the contributions to the potential energy are in general state - dependent , the most prominent example of the latter being the debye - hckel effective pair potential that has been extensively employed to model charge - stabilised colloidal suspensions under certain physical conditions @xcite .",
    "sometimes the state - dependence of an effective pair potential hides precisely the effect of many - body forces and then particular care has to be taken in the ways in which the pair potential is employed , so as to avoid blatant thermodynamic inconsistencies @xcite .",
    "many - body potentials are already encountered in the realm of atomic systems , the axilrod - teller interaction @xcite being a characteristic example that has been shown to be relevant for the description of high - precision measurements of the structure factor of rare gases @xcite . a formal decomposition of the effective potential energy function between the particles of one kind in a binary mixture in which the particles of the other kind are traced out has been given in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the treatment there applies only to mixtures for which the number densities of the two components can be varied at will , e.g. , colloid - polymer or hard - sphere mixtures .",
    "it is not applicable to two broad categories of soft matter systems , namely charged mixtures and solutions of polymers of arbitrary architecture . in the former case ,",
    "the number densities of the two components are constrained by the electroneutrality condition . in the latter , where one specific monomer @xcite or the centre of mass of the molecule @xcite are chosen as effective , mesoscopic coordinates ,",
    "the total number of monomers and the number of effective particles are coupled to each other through the constraint of keeping the number of monomers per macromolecule fixed .    in charge - stabilised colloidal suspensions ,",

    "their effects have been examined by density functional theory and simulations @xcite as well as by numerical solution of the nonlinear - poisson boltzmann equation @xcite .",

    "@xcite , a result confirmed by direct experimental measurements using optical tweezers @xcite .",
    "as far as polymeric systems are concerned , the triplet forces in star polymer solutions have been analysed by theory and simulations in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was found that they play a minor role for concentrations vastly exceeding the overlap density . for linear chains , on the other hand , the many - body forces appear to have a more pronounced effect , as witnessed by the considerable state - dependence of the effective pair potential that reproduces the correlation functions of concentrated polymer solutions @xcite .",
    "the general functional form of the centre - of - mass effective interaction between polymer chains was found to preserve its gaussian form , its strength and range being nevertheless modified within a range of @xmath3 of their original values , due to many - body effects @xcite .",
    "another polymeric system that serves as a prototype for a tunable colloidal system that displays a gaussian , soft effective pair interaction is that of a solution of dendritic macromolecules , or dendrimers for simplicity @xcite .",
    "it has been recently shown that a gaussian effective pair potential can describe extremely well the scattering intensities obtained experimentally from concentrated dendrimer solutions @xcite .",
    "the gaussian pair interaction has also been explicitly measured in recent computer simulations that employed two different coarse - grained models for the microscopic , monomer - monomer interactions @xcite . nevertheless , in the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite only _ two _ dendritic molecules were simulated , hence no information about many - body forces was gained . in the present work ,",
    "we address the issue of the magnitude and importance of many - body effective interaction potentials in concentrated dendrimer solutions .",
    "we do not attempt to derive an explicit decomposition of the potential energy function into @xmath4-body terms , @xmath5 ; this would require separate simulations of just @xmath4 dendrimers . instead , we explicitly simulate a large number of interacting dendrimers at the microscopic level simultaneously .",
    "we measure thereby the pair correlation functions in the concentrated system directly and we compare the result with the one obtained by simulating the _ same _ number of dendrimers as effective entities interacting exclusively by means of pair potentials .",
    "the discrepancies in the results from the two approaches for the correlation functions yield then information regarding the importance of the many - body forces _ of all orders_. we find that the many - body effects are of minor importance , especially for flexible dendrimers .    the rest of the paper is organised as follows . in section [ model : sec ]",
    "we present our model and the simulation details . in section [",
    "pair : sec ] we present our results for the correlation functions derived by the two approaches mentioned above and we discuss the magnitude and origin of their discrepancies . in section [ scatter : sec ] we turn our attention to the issue of the interpretation of the total scattering intensities from concentrated dendrimer solutions , and in particular to the question of the validity of the so - called factorisation approximation of the latter as the product of the form- and the structure factor , discussing the limits of applicability of such an approach . finally , in section [ summary : sec ] we summarise and conclude .",
    "in this work , we focus exclusively on dendrimers of the fourth generation ( g4 ) .",

    "this bead - thread model was originally introduced by sheng _",
    "@xcite , who kept a fixed value @xmath12 and examined the scaling of the radius of gyration of the dendrimers as a function of generation number and spacer length .",

    ", we have shown that the conformational properties of single dendrimers are insensitive with respect to the details of the microscopic model . moreover ,",
    "this very simple , coarse - grained model reproduces the experimental scattering data for isolated dendrimers very well @xcite .",
    "as we are only interested in static properties , we also allow ` ghost chains ' , i.e. , crossing of bonds occurring for @xmath14 are possible .",
    "monte carlo simulations of this model are very fast , as there is no need to calculate energies ; one only needs to check for overlaps , and additionally whether the conditions of the maximal bond extension are fulfilled .",
    "if one of these conditions is violated , the trial move is rejected in any case , so the search for further overlaps can be aborted .",
    "furthermore , due to the very short range of the hard sphere interaction , neighbour lists are very effective .    the effective _ pair _ interaction potential between the centres of mass of two g4-dendrimers has been determined with the help of configuration - biased monte carlo simulations of this model in ref .",

    "it appears , therefore , that the extraction of an accurate structure factor from concentrated dendrimer solutions is extremely difficult as one approaches the overlap concentration .",
    "we anticipate that this result is also valid for other ` polymeric colloids ' such as star - shaped polymers and brushes .",
