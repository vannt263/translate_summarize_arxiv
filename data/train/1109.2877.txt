    "current observations of the large scale cosmic microwave background suggest to us that our physical universe is expanding in an accelerated way , isotropic and homogeneous models with a positive cosmological constant .",
    "the analysis of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) fluctuations could confirm this picture . but other analyses reveal some inconsistencies",
    ". analysis of wmap data sets shows us that the universe might have a preferred direction .",
    "for this reason , it may be interesting to study bianchi models since these models may describe such anisotropies .",
    "the observed location of the first acoustic peak of the temperature fluctuations on the cmb corroborated by the data obtained in different experiments @xcite , indicates that the universe is dominated by an unidentified dark energy  and suggests that this unidentified dark energy has a negative pressure @xcite .",
    "this last characteristic of the dark energy points to the vacuum energy or cosmological constant as a possible candidate for dark energy .",
    "although , it is a general belief that the current curvature of the universe is negligible and mostly the universe is considered with a flat geometry , recent observations support the possibility of a non - flat universe and detect a small deviation from @xmath0 @xcite . for example , evidence from cmb and also supernova measurements of the cubic correction to the luminosity distance favour a positively curved universe @xcite .    in order to explain the current acceleration of the universe , within general relativity ( gr ) , it is necessary to introduce a new type of energy with a negative pressure . between the different possible approaches",
    "is one which consists of considering so - called dark energy ( de ) .",
    "there are several candidates for de , where the simplest one is the cosmological term @xmath1 .",
    "however , this choice has several drawbacks such as coincidence and fine tuning problems .",
    "for this reason other models have been proposed .",
    "examples of such models are quintessence @xcite , k - essence @xcite , or chameleonic fields in which a scalar field is coupled to matter chame ,  etc .",
    "hence it is natural and important to consider a variable @xmath2term in more general frameworks where , furthermore , other quantities , such as the newton gravitational constant may be considered as dynamical .",
    "one such class of theories are the scalar - tensor theories ( stt ) of gravity .",
    "this class of models has received a renewed interest in recent times , for two main reasons : first , the new inflationary scenario as the extended inflation has a scalar field that solves several problems present in the old theories .",
    "secondly , string theories and other unified theories contain a scalar field which plays a similar role to the scalar field of the stt .",
    "the scalar - tensor theories started with the work of p. jordan in 1950 @xcite .",
    "a prototype of such models was proposed by brans and dicke in 1961 @xcite .",
    "their aim for presenting this model was to modify einstein s theory in such a way as to incorporate the so called `` mach s principle '' .",
    "these theories have been generalized by p.g .",
    "bergmann @xcite , k. nordtverdt @xcite and r. t. wagoner @xcite . for a recent review of this class of theories we refer to @xcite and @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we want to consider a family of scalar - tensor theories with a dynamical cosmological constant @xcite and with a potential @xcite , that is equivalent to a time dependent cosmological constant .",
    "recently several authors have considered the cosmological consequences of a time varying cosmological constant .",
    "most of them introduce the time dependence in an ad hoc manner . in this work",
    "we consider an equivalent problem in the well known general scalar - tensor theory of gravity where the time dependence can occur in a natural way , without any new assumption or modification of the theory and provide an explanation for the acceleration of the universe expansion @xcite .",
    "many authors have studied these general scalar - tensor theories .",
    "they use the observational data in order to obtain restrictions or constraint between the functions that appear in the action to obtain an accelerated model boisseau-@xcite .",
    "our approach is different : we want to derive these functions from symmetry principles as self - similarity .",
    "we shall carry out our study under this assumption and state some general theorems that are valid for all the bianchi models and of course for the flat frw one .",
    "it is most appropriate for us to work in the jordan frame ( jf ) , in which the physical quantities are those that are being measured in experiments , even though the einstein frame ( ef ) often provides a better mathematical insight .",
    "the study of self - similar ( ss ) models is quite important since a large class of orthogonal spatially homogeneous models are asymptotically self - similar at the initial singularity and are approximated by exact perfect fluid or vacuum self - similar power - law models .",
    "exact self - similar power - law models can also approximate general bianchi models at intermediate stages of their evolution .",
    "this last point is of particular importance in relating bianchi models to the real universe . at the same time",
    ", self - similar solutions can describe the behaviour of bianchi models at late times i.e. as @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section two",
    "we start by considering a particular formulation of the theory . in this case",
    "the cosmological constant is introduced directly by the function @xmath4 w. we study this model through two different approaches .",
    "the first consists of studying the effective stress - energy tensor under the matter collineation approach .",
    "this method allows us to obtain relationships between the physical quantities as well as to determine the exact form of the scalar field @xmath5 the second approach consists of studying the wave equation under the lie group method . by imposing a particular symmetry we are able to determine the exact form for each of the functions that appear in this equation",
    "we summarize all the results by stating a very general theorem . in section three",
    "we study a very general scalar - tensor theory . in this case",
    "the cosmological constant is introduced by the potential .",
    "following the same exposed procedure as in the above section , we are able to determine the exact form that all of the unknowns involved in this model must have . we show , from the stated theorem , how different versions of this theory arise , which are the standard brans - dicke theory , the induced gravity model @xcite and a very particular solution where the effective gravitational function is constant . in section four",
    "we study a chameleon jordan - brans - dicke model . in order to show how all the obtained results work , in section five we study a particular example which is the kantowski - sach model .",
    "we start this section by showing that this metric admits a homothetic vector fields and then we study several models .",
    "we put special emphasis on comparing the solutions obtained in each case . in section six",
    "we end by summarizing all the results .",
    "we have added an appendix where we study in detail one of the equations obtained in section 2 in order to show with out any doubt that the brans - dicke parameter @xmath6 must be constant in this framework of self - similar solutions .",
    "following to will ( see @xcite ) we start with the action for the most general scalar - tensor theory of gravitation@xmath7 + s_{ng } ,   \\label{w1}\\]]where @xmath8 , @xmath9 is newton s constant , @xmath10 is the action for the nongravitational matter .",

    "for example , if we set for @xmath346 then the solutions only depend on @xmath347 in such a way that given different values to @xmath348 then we shall may to study their behaviour . for @xmath349 @xmath350 we get @xmath284 and @xmath246 iff @xmath351 while @xmath352 if @xmath353 we arrive at the same conclusion if @xmath354 note that the cases @xmath355 and @xmath356 are forbidden . therefore , the obtained solution is only valid if @xmath353",
    "we have studied under the self - similar hypothesis the admitted form of the different unknown functions in several scalar - tensor theories . by employing the matter collineation ( mc ) approach , i.e. calculating the lie derivate of the effective stress - energy tensor with respect to an hvf , and the lie group method , we have been able to state theorems valid for all the bianchi geometries as well as for a flat frw metric .",
    "we have used both tactics , because with the mc in some of the models studied we are only able to obtain relationships between the physical quantities . with this tactic",
    "we only obtain self - similar solutions .",
    "nevertheless , with the lie group method we are able to obtain the exact form for each of the physical quantities .",
    "furthermore , with this approach we obtain scaling solutions which are more general than the self - similar one .    in the first of the models",
    "studied we arrive to the conclusion that @xmath357 and therefore @xmath358 while the dynamical cosmological constant behaves as @xmath359 in the same way we have deduced that the brans - dicke parameter @xmath360 must be constant . in the second of the models",
    "studied , the generalized scalar - tensor model , the dynamical cosmological constant is mimicked by the potential @xmath361 and therefore we have three unknown functions , @xmath362 @xmath363 and the potential @xmath167 we arrive at a very general result which allows us to outline different scalar - tensor models that admit self - similar solutions .",
    "actually this result is in agreement with the fact that we may pass from one model to another through conformal transformations . as an example",
    "we have emphasized three relevant models , the standard scalar - tensor model , the induced gravity model and a specific model which is very similar to the scalar cosmological model where @xmath364 in the third of the models studied , following the same procedure , we calculate the admitted form for the unknown functions @xmath365 and the potential in order to obtain scaling and self - similar solutions .",
    "once we have established all these results then we study a particular example , the kantowski - sach model .",
    "the same procedure may be applied to other bianchi models .",
    "we begin by showing that this metric admits and hvf .",
    "we explore some cosmological models and applying the stated theorems we find exact solutions .",
    "we show that there is no vacuum solution . for the perfect fluid case , within the general relativity framework",
    ", we find that the solution obtained is only valid for a particular equation of state , @xmath366 , which is not strange in this class of solutions , while the exponent of one of the scale factors is irrational .",
    "this fact is odd since these constants usually are rational ones .",
    "note that the solution is inflationary since @xmath367 without any necessity to appeal to a dm component . in the third model , where @xmath187 and @xmath1 are considered as time - varying within the general relativity framework we have shown that the obtained solution is valid for all value of @xmath195 . in this case",
    "@xmath187 may be a growing or decreasing function finding that it behaves as a true constant only when @xmath368 the dynamical cosmological constant is always a decreasing time function but it may be positive or negative and it vanishes if @xmath369 once we know how each physical quantity works in the general relativity framework then we explore some solutions for the scalar - tensor models .",
    "we have not been able to find a solution in the case of a brans - dicke model with a dynamical @xmath370 this result is quite surprising since following the same procedure we have obtained solutions for several bianchi models . nevertheless for the bd model with a potential",
    "we obtain an exact self - similar solution . the numerical analysis carried out",
    "shows us that the solution obtained is only valid in a small neighbourhood , @xmath371 of @xmath372 the critical value of @xmath194 where the energy density and the scalar function are positive .",
    "the solution shows analogies with that obtained in the subsection where @xmath187 and @xmath1 are considered as time - varying within the general relativity framework .",
    "for example , @xmath373 may be a growing or decreasing function finding that it behaves as a true constant only when @xmath369 the dynamical cosmological constant , the potential @xmath361 is always a decreasing time function but it may be positive in the interval of definition or vanish if @xmath374 the model also accelerates since @xmath196 trying to generalize this scenario we also consider a chameleon bd model . we show that the obtained solution is valid for all values of @xmath195 instead of only in @xmath375 in the last model studied , the induced gravity case , we find that the solution is only valid if @xmath351 ( a phantom scenario ) . in the appendix",
    "we emphasize the fact that the only form compatible with self - similar solutions for the bd parameter @xmath360 is @xmath376 therefore none of the scaling solutions admit a variable @xmath377",
