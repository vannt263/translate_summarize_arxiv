    "previously we introduced an su(4 ) model of competing antiferromagnetism ( af ) and @xmath0-wave superconductivity ( sc ) , used coherent states to provide a connection to landau - ginzburg and symmetry constrained hartree - fock - bogoliubov theory , and demonstrated that su(4 ) symmetry implies no double occupancy .",

    "dynamics of these interacting cooper pairs at different hole - doping and temperature yields rich phase diagrams that may explain the main features of observations .",
    "the occurrence of a pseudogap , a critical value of doping , and splitting of the sc gap at low doping region are all natural consequences of the dynamics .    in this article",
    "we extend our previous discussion and compare gap and phase diagrams computed using the formalism developed in ref.@xcite with available data .",
    "we demonstrate that our analytically - solvable gap equations with doping - independent interactions already describe the basic features of experimental gap and phase diagrams for the cuprates .",
    "with addition of simple doping dependence for interaction strengths in the low - doping region , our results can reproduce quantitatively the superconducting gap , the pseudogap , and the doping variation of both the superconducting transition temperature @xmath1 and the pseudogap transition temperature @xmath2 extracted from a range of cuprate data .",

    "figure [ fig : fig]a suggests qualitative agreement between predicted and observed gap structure at @xmath44 but there are two quantitative discrepancies : ( 1 )  the slope of @xmath34 is too small at low doping , and ( 2 )  the onset of a pairing gap at zero doping in the calculation contradicts data suggesting that this onset should occur closer to 5% hole doping .",
    "these discrepancies indicate that the constant coupling strength assumption gives unrealistic strong pairing and too weak af strength in the low - doping region .",
    "they can be removed by allowing a simple doping dependence for the coupling strengths according to the following physical considerations .",
    "first , the su(4 ) symmetry requires that the pure af state can exist only when @xmath93 , which suggests that pairing strength must have an onset at @xmath94 .",
    "second , to reproduce the experimental nel temperature , @xmath14 has to be strongest at @xmath95 .",
    "these suggest a doping dependence for @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 given by the inset to fig .  [",
    "fig : fig]c , which implies an onset of pairing strength at @xmath96 ( in the simplest picture we assume the same onset for singlet and triplet pairing , but with different magnitudes ) , and a large af correlation at half - filling that decreases as doping increases , but finally is stabilized as pairing is established . with that change , the more quantitative agreement with data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig]c results .",
    "in figs .  [ fig : fig]a and [ fig : fig]c all energies are scaled by @xmath97 .",
    "the solution ( [ udopdd ] ) indicates that @xmath67 depends only on @xmath61 , once @xmath12 is fixed .",
    "if the critical doping @xmath61 has a universal value ( for example , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the doping dependence for @xmath67 also should be universal if gaps are scaled by the maximum @xmath1 for each compound , since the maximum @xmath1 is proportional to @xmath12 ( see ref .",
    "it is well known that cuprate sc pairing gaps exhibit such scaling .",
    "the emergence of the critical doping @xmath61 and the splitting of the singlet gap for @xmath98 are a direct consequence of competing pairing and af correlations below @xmath61 . when doping is low , af correlations dominate pairing and a state with large af gap and suppressed pairing is the ground state .",
    "therefore , the superconducting gap for the ground state is small ( @xmath99 ) and the large pairing gap @xmath79 is associated with an excited state when @xmath98 .",
    "however , as doping increases the su(4 ) symmetry implies that pairing correlations decrease less quickly than the af correlations ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and they eventually dominate .",
    "the energy is then minimized by larger pairing and diminished af correlation .",
    "the critical point @xmath61 is the hole - doping fraction where the ground - state af correlations vanish completely in the variational solution .",
    "the competing - order picture @xcite assumes that the pseudogap ( pg ) is an energy scale for order competing with superconductivity that vanishes at a critical doping point where the competition is completely suppressed . from figs . 1a and 1c ,",
    "@xmath66 ( an order parameter of the af phase ) has precisely these properties .",
    "but the af operators are generators of su(4 ) , so @xmath66 _ also _ is the stabilization energy for a mixture of preformed singlet and triplet su(4 ) pairs that condense into a strong superconducting state only after af and triplet pairing fluctuations are suppressed by hole doping .",
    "this represents a non - abelian generalization of the standard phase - fluctuation model @xcite for preformed pairs .",
    "thus , the su(4 ) pseudogap state results from competing af and sc order expressed in a basis of singlet and triplet fermion pairs , which may be viewed as a unification of the competing order and preformed pair pictures",
    "triplet pairs are an essential component of the su(4 ) many - body wavefunction ( for example , the su(4 ) algebra , which imposes the no double occupancy condition on the lattice , does not close in the absence of triplet pair operators )",
    ". however , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig ] indicates that the triplet pair correlation energy is small in the underdoped region and zero for doping larger than @xmath100 .",
    "the primary role of triplet pairs in the hole - doped cuprates appears to lie in fluctuations mediating the af  sc competition .",
    "in figs .  [ fig : fig]b and [ fig : fig]d we show phase diagrams resulting from finite - temperature calculations . figure",
    "[ fig : fig]b assumes the coupling strengths of fig.[fig : fig]a and fig .  [ fig : fig]d assumes the coupling strengths of fig .  [ fig : fig]c , so the only adjustable parameter in either case is @xmath101 . the empirical factor @xmath102 [ see eq .",
    "( [ density ] ) ] is introduced because actual single - particle energies due to thermal excitation are non - degenerate and realistic quasiparticle excitation should be easier than in our degenerate approximation .",
    "there are four distinct phases in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig]b and [ fig : fig]d :    1 .",
    "an antiferromagnetic phase ( labeled af ) .",
    "2 .   a superconducting phase ( labeled sc ) .",
    "3 .   a transitional phase with all three correlations present ( labeled af+sc ) .",
    "4 .   a metallic phase .",
    "the correlations involved in each phase are indicated in parentheses in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig]b and the doping - dependent temperatures @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath90 ( or @xmath89 ) mark the phase boundaries .",
    "data from refs .",
    "@xcite are compared with the predicted su(4 ) phase structure in figs.[fig : fig]b and [ fig : fig]d .",
    "the constant coupling approximation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig]b ) reproduces data qualitatively , but the predicted superconductivity extends too low in doping and the upper boundary on the af phase does not rise steeply enough at low doping ( leading to a nel temperature a factor of 23 too low ) .",
    "these discrepancies are removed in fig.[fig : fig]d , which allows the evolution of coupling with doping indicated in the inset .",
    "it is commonly believed that in the cuprate phase diagram there is a boundary ( for example , the one labeled @xmath103 in ref.@xcite ) distinguishing an af long - range ordered state from a disordered one .",
    "we do not discuss this possibility here but note that the potential to describe such a boundary is contained in the present model .",
    "if ( contrary to our minimal assumptions here ) we permit onset of the triplet pairing strength at somewhat lower doping than for the singlet pairing , a new boundary will appear in the very - low doping region ( @xmath104 0.020.05 ) that separates a pure af phase from the pg region .",
    "there are additional ( generally higher - temperature ) data that have been related to the pseudogap discussion beyond that displayed in fig .",
    "1 . their physical interpretation is generally unsettled .",
    "our theoretical @xmath2 is clearly defined as the temperature at which the pg in the su(4 ) model goes to zero .",
    "once the interaction strengths are fitted to the gap data , there are no free parameters to modify the theoretical @xmath2 curve .",
    "thus , any reproducible data that lie substantially above our predicted @xmath2 curve may be associated either with physics that goes beyond the minimal model that is described here , or with a definition for @xmath2 that is inconsistent with ours .",
    "the results of fig .  [ fig : fig ] are supported by various additional data .",
    "we mention a few representative examples .",
    "nmr measurements @xcite using strong magnetic fields to suppress sc in bi@xmath105sr@xmath106la@xmath107cuo@xmath108 concluded that the pg coexists with sc and terminates in a critical point near @xmath109 .",
    "figure [ fig : fig ] could accommodate @xmath110 with small parameter changes , but also we note that magnetic fields could increase @xmath100 by altering the sc  af competition . from specific heat , nmr , and transport data ,",
    "tallon et al @xcite conclude that high-@xmath1 phase behavior is universal , with a critical doping @xmath111 where the pg vanishes and where large changes in quantities like the superfluid density indicate crossover from weak to strong superconductivity , and that this transition implies vanishing short - range magnetic order .",
    "a key role for magnetic correlations in pg states also is suggested by the effect of impurities on @xmath112-axis optical conductivity @xcite .",
    "in - plane resistivity measurements @xcite indicate that the phase diagram is surprisingly universal , with a pg terminating near optimal doping and different electronic states either side of the termination .",
    "these measurements also indicate a crossover above @xmath1 between two kinds of pg behavior ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which may be explicable in terms of the finite but decreasing pair fluctuations expected in the pg region , as we now discuss .    figure [ fig : fig ] may explain the vortex - like nernst signal @xcite observed above @xmath1 .",
    "the singlet pair gap vanishes there but the many - body su(4 ) wavefunction has finite pair content between the curves @xmath2 and @xmath1 that decreases with increasing @xmath56 and decreasing doping .",
    "thus , contours for pair fluctuations above @xmath1 will be similar to observed contours for nernst signal strength , but a meissner effect is expected only below @xmath1 .",
    "recently , ong et al @xcite concluded that a consistent explanation of pseudogap and nernst data requires pg and sc pairing states that are distinct but related by symmetry , as proposed here .",
    "more detailed properties of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig ] may be investigated in future work .",
    "for example , the transition between the af+sc and sc phases is 2nd - order if @xmath100 lies at higher doping than the point _",
    "b _ ( solid curve @xmath90 in fig.[fig : fig]d ) , but is 1st - order if it lies at lower doping ( dotted curve @xmath113 , starting from the point _ a _ ) .",
    "this implies a wealth of testable consequences for the gap and phase structure depending both on global properties and on microscopic details .",
    "in summary , finite - temperature su(4 ) coherent states have been used to construct a rich , universal gap and phase structure for hole - doped cuprates that may be expressed in a bcs - like formalism with two kinds of quasiparticles and competing superconducting and antiferromagnetic order .",
    "we find a pseudogap of antiferromagnetic character terminating at a critical doping @xmath114 that is distinct from the superconducting state but related to it by a non - abelian symmetry .",
    "the corresponding pseudogap states may be interpreted in terms of either sc  af competition or preformed su(4 ) pairs that condense into a singlet @xmath0-wave superconductor as hole doping suppresses fluctuations .",
    "our results represent a minimal variational solution of competing antiferromagnetism and @xmath0-wave superconductivity on a fermionic lattice with no double occupancy .",
    "therefore , we believe that the general gap and phase structure presented here will be a necessary consequence of any realistic theory that takes a doped mott insulator with competing @xmath115wave pairing and antiferromagnetism as the basis for describing high - temperature superconductivity ."
