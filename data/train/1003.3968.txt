    "in this paper , a graph is understood to be undirected and have no loops or multiple edges .",
    "while graphs with multiple edges could be taken under consideration , it is not necessary to do so as multiple edges do not add any difficulty or important properties .    a set of vertices in a graph @xmath0",
    "is said to be independent if no two vertices in the set are joined by an edge .",
    "an independent set @xmath1 of @xmath0 is called maximal if no independent set of @xmath0 properly contains @xmath1 .",
    "the largest ( in terms of cardinality ) maximal independent set ( or sets ) of @xmath0 is called a maximum independent set of @xmath0 , and a graph is said to be well - covered if every maximal independent set of @xmath0 is also maximum . a well - covered graph could also be defined by the property of all maximal independent sets having the same cardinality .",
    "this notion was introduced by plummer in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "brown and nowakowski defined a well - covered weighting of a graph @xmath0 as a function @xmath2 that assigns values to the vertices of @xmath0 in such a way that @xmath3 is a constant for all maximal independent sets @xmath1 of @xmath0 .",
    "it is immediate from the latter definition that one could re - define well - coveredness by saying that a well - covered graph is a graph that admits the constant function equal to @xmath4 as a well - covered weighting of @xmath0 .",
    "we will use brown and nowakowski s presentation ( notation , nomenclature , etc ) , although this problem was originally introduced by caro , ellingham , ramey , and yuster in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is easy to show that , once a field @xmath5 is fixed , the set of all well - covered weightings of a graph @xmath0 is an @xmath5-vector space , which is called _ the well - covered space of @xmath0_. the dimension of this vector space over @xmath5 is called the _ well - covered dimension of @xmath0 _ and is denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "if @xmath7 does not depend on the field used then the well - covered dimension of @xmath0 is instead denoted as @xmath8 .",
    "the well - covered dimension of a graph @xmath0 can therefore be considered to be the cardinality of a set of vertices @xmath9 of @xmath0 whose weights are independent of each other and on which the weights of the remaining vertices of @xmath0 are dependent , provided that the weighting is a well - covered weighting .",
    "most of the results obtained in this paper are independent of the characteristic of @xmath10 , and when the characteristic becomes something to consider we will be careful to remark on it .",
    "our graph theoretic notation , algebraic notation , and matrix theoretic notation is standard ; the reader can look at @xcite for any concepts we fail to define .",
    "the vertex set of a graph @xmath0 is denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "the cardinality of a set of vertices @xmath12 is denoted by @xmath13 . a field with @xmath14 ( @xmath15 prime ) elements",
    "is denoted by @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath17 identity matrix is denoted by @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath17 matrix where each entry is a @xmath4 is denoted by @xmath19 .",
    "an @xmath20 column vector where each entry is a @xmath4 is denoted by @xmath21 .",
    "an @xmath20 column vector where each entry is a @xmath22 is denoted by @xmath23 .",
    "it is relatively simple to calculate the well - covered dimension of a graph @xmath0 , provided @xmath0 is not too large .",
    "one first needs to find all the independent sets of @xmath0 , which can be done using a greedy algorithm .",
    "suppose that the maximal independent sets of @xmath0 are @xmath24 for @xmath25 .",
    "then a well - covered weighting @xmath26 of @xmath0 is determined by a solution of the linear system of equations formed by selecting a maximal independent set , in this particular instance @xmath27 , and setting the system @xmath28 for @xmath29 .",
    "this system is homogeneous , and can therefore be written in the form @xmath30 .",
    "note that @xmath31 is an @xmath32 matrix where @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "as this system is homogeneous , the nullity of @xmath31 ( here is where @xmath35 could be relevant ) is equivalent to @xmath6 .",
    "so , @xmath36 . in the case when @xmath37 , then @xmath38 , which implies that in this case the only possible well - covered weighting is the @xmath22 function .    for the remainder of this paper , we shall concern ourselves only with the determining of the well - covered dimensions for various individual graphs and graph families .",
    "we start by recalling a lemma from @xcite , as it will allow us to focus only on connected graphs .",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath39 be graphs . then @xmath40    the family of ( connected ) graphs that is possibly the easiest to attack when looking for well - covered dimensions is the family of complete graphs . by simply looking at the maximal independent sets of @xmath41 we get that @xmath42 .",
    "similarly , using the previous lemma , we get @xmath43 .",
    "only using the technique mentioned above , it is easy to find the well - covered dimension of several families of graphs .",
    "\\(a ) @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the petersen graph .",
    "+ ( b ) the two graphs in figure [ sg1andsg2 ] below are he smallest graphs such that their well - covered dimension depends on the characteristic of the base field ( @xmath46 ) or it is zero ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "in fact , @xmath48     ( left ) and @xmath47 ( right).,title=\"fig:\",height=144 ]   ( left ) and @xmath47 ( right).,title=\"fig:\",height=144 ]    a similar result is obtained for crown graphs .",
    "recall that , for any @xmath49 , the crown graph @xmath50 is formed by removing a perfect matching from @xmath51 .",
    "though not specifically stated as such , it was proven in @xcite that @xmath52 , if @xmath53 , and @xmath54 if both @xmath55 and @xmath56 are even .",
    "we shall extend this result to allow us to calculate the well - covered dimensions of all crown graphs over all fields .",
    "let @xmath50 denote a crown graph , for all @xmath57 .",
    "then , @xmath58    let @xmath59 be the complete bipartite graph with @xmath60 and @xmath61 and let @xmath62 be the perfect matching that is removed from @xmath59 to form @xmath50 .",
    "the maximal independent sets of @xmath50 are @xmath63 for @xmath64 , and @xmath65 and @xmath66 . setting the sum of each of the weights on the maximal independent sets equal to that of the weights on the vertices of @xmath66",
    ", we find that the linear system corresponding to the well - covered weightings is @xmath67 , where @xmath68 an @xmath69 matrix . subtracting the top @xmath56 rows from the bottom yields @xmath70 it follows that we have two possibilities depending on whether or not @xmath71 divides @xmath72 .",
    "the theorem follows after finding the rank of this matrix in either case .",
    "[ k - partite ] @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the ( obvious ) complete @xmath75-partite graph .",

    ", we find that the linear system corresponding to the well - covered weightings is @xmath67 , where @xmath82 a @xmath83 matrix .",
    "@xmath31 has rank @xmath84 .",
    "hence the nullity is @xmath85 , which implies that @xmath86 .",
    "[ turan ] @xmath87 , where @xmath88 denotes a turn graph .",
    "we can see immediately that if @xmath56 is divisible by @xmath89 , then corollary [ turan ] reduces to @xmath90 .",
    "the behaviors , in terms of well - covered weightings , of paths and cycles are very similar .",
    "hence , we will study these two families simultaneously .",
    "consider @xmath0 to be an @xmath56-path or an @xmath91-cycle , for @xmath92 .",
    "label six ` consecutive ' vertices @xmath93 and @xmath76 as in the picture below .",
    "let @xmath26 be a well - covered weighting of @xmath0 , and let @xmath94 and @xmath95 be two maximal independent sets of @xmath0 that contain the same vertices except from @xmath94 containing @xmath96 and @xmath95 containing @xmath97 instead .",
    "locally , these two independent sets are represented in the figure below .     and @xmath95 on six consecutive vertices . ]    since @xmath94 and @xmath95 just ` interchange ' @xmath98 and @xmath99 , then @xmath100 .",
    "it is now immediate that all vertices of @xmath101 , for @xmath102 , have the same weight for all well - covered weightings of this graph .",
    "hence , @xmath103 for all @xmath102 .    now consider two maximal independent sets @xmath104 and @xmath105 of @xmath101 , with @xmath102 , that contain the same vertices outside of a string of seven consecutive vertices , where @xmath104 and @xmath105 contain four and three vertices respectively .",
    "these seven vertices , with the vertices contained in @xmath104 and @xmath105 are represented in figure [ differentnumberofelements ] below .",
    "it follows that this graph admits maximal independent sets with different cardinalities , and thus @xmath106 for all @xmath102 .",
    "similarly , from the argument associated to figure [ sixconsecutivevertices ] , if @xmath92 and @xmath107 ( edges connecting @xmath108 with @xmath109 ) then vertices @xmath110 must have the same weight for all well - covered weightings of @xmath111 .",
    "moreover , for small values of @xmath56 it is easy to see that these weights must be zero . for larger values of @xmath56 figure [ differentnumberofelements ] provides a way to construct maximal independent sets with different cardinality , which forces @xmath112 .    finally , we can construct two maximal independent sets of @xmath111 that share all but one vertex , which is @xmath113 for one of them and @xmath114 for the other .",
    "this can be seen in the figure below .",
    "it follows that @xmath115 , and symmetrically that @xmath116 , for all well - covered weightings @xmath26 of @xmath111 .",
    "lastly , we want to remark that @xmath117 is independent of @xmath118 , and thus , adding simple computations to the arguments above we obtain the following theorem :    if @xmath26 is a well - covered weighting of @xmath119 and @xmath120 , then @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 .",

    "let @xmath141 be the gear graph in @xmath132 vertices , then @xmath142",
