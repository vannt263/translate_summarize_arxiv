    "a gamma - ray burst ( grb ) is the most luminous event in the universe . in a few seconds it produces an enormous amount of electromagnetic energy , which is comparable to the integrated emission of the sun over ten billion years ( meszaros 2006 ) .",
    "most of this energy is released in the first few seconds in the form of gamma rays ( kev to mev ) , known as the prompt emission phase . in some grbs",
    "very high energy ( gev ) emission is also observed during the prompt phase .",
    "later the afterglow of a grb can be observed at all electromagnetic frequencies from the radio wavelengths up to x - rays and even gamma rays .",
    "numerous satellite experiments have been performed to pin down the mechanism of grbs . for ten long years ( 1991 - 2000 )",
    ", a great wealth of prompt emission data was collected by the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ; fishman et al .",
    "1994 ) onboard the compton gamma - ray observatory ( _ cgro _ ) . with",
    "( barthelmy et al .",
    "2005 ; gehrels et al . 2004 ) and _ fermi _ ( meegan et al . 2009 ) , launched respectively in 2004 and 2008 , we have entered into the modern era of grb research . _ swift _ , with its fantastic slewing capability , an unprecedented localization accuracy of the primary grb detector ( burst alert telescope  bat , a large field of view gamma ray monitor ) and the high spatial resolution instruments for the afterglow studies has enabled the measurement of the redshift for many grbs .",
    "_ fermi _ , on the other hand , has enabled a detailed spectral study during the prompt emission phase , and discovered the very high energy ( gev ) emission both during the prompt and afterglow phase for many bursts",
    "( very few such events were known before _",
    "fermi_. see e.g. , gonzlez et al .",
    "both these satellites have supplied extremely valuable data for the identification of the working mechanism of grbs .",
    "but , even after nearly fifty years of discovery , various issues remain puzzling , most notably the prompt emission mechanism .    in the preliminary model of a grb , known as the `` standard fireball model '' ( goodman 1986 ; paczynski 1986 ) , the radiation is supposed to come from a photosphere .",
    "the instantaneous spectrum is predicted to be a blackbody ( bb ) and the light curve ( lc ) is a simple pulse .",
    "though we do see a grb having a single pulse , there is a variety of lc profiles .",
    "there are also differences in the predicted and observed spectrum . while the bb spectral shape in the photon space is a hump with a narrow peak , which can be approximated with a low energy power - law with a + 1 index and a steep power - law with a negative index at high energy , grb prompt emission spectra usually have non - thermal spectral shape characterized with negative power - law indices ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "though there is a provision for geometric broadening ( goodman 1986 ) , the spectrum is still far from what is observed . to overcome this difficulty",
    ", it is assumed that the radiation is not coming from the photosphere , but it is produced in the internal shocks ( is ) of the ejecta via synchrotron radiation ( rees & meszaros 1994 ; woods & loeb 1995 ; sari & piran 1997 ; kobayashi et al .",
    "this model is phenomenologically represented by the featureless band function ( band et al .",
    "1993 ) , which is a smoothly joined power - laws with two indices  @xmath3 as the lower energy index and @xmath5 as the higher energy index . in the ef(e )",
    "representation , the function peaks at an energy ( @xmath6 ) , provided that @xmath7 , which can be violated for very hard spectra . the prompt emission data , whether time - integrated or time - resolved , is adequately fit by the band function ( kaneko et al .",
    "2006 ; nava et al . 2011",
    "; zhang et al . 2011 ) .",
    "however , the band function is a phenomenological function and the actual spectrum may have rich structure . in many studies , additional components to the band function ( preece et al . 1996 ; meszaros & rees 2000 ; gonzlez et al .",
    "2003 ; shirasaki et al .",
    "2008 ; abdo et al .",
    "2009 , ackermann et al . 2010 ; ackermann et al . 2011",
    "; guiriec et al . 2011 ; axelsson et al . 2012 ; guiriec et al .",
    "2013 ) and even alternative models ( ghirlanda et al . 2003",
    "; ryde 2004 ; ryde & peer 2009 ; peer & ryde 2011 ) have been suggested .",
    "the reason for resorting to alternative description is that the internal shock model demands that in the electron slow cooling regime , the photon index ( @xmath3 ) should be less than -2/3 ( preece et al .",
    "1998 ) , the single particle synchrotron limit .",
    "grbs are usually expected to be in the fast cooling regime where the photon index should be near -3/2 ( cohen et al .",
    "these two limits are referred to as the `` synchrotron lines of death '' .",
    "the value of @xmath3 is often found to be higher than the -2/3 ( crider et al . 1999 ) .",
    "moreover , the is model has the following issues .",
    "the efficiency of converting the kinetic energy to the internal energy and then radiating is rather low ( less than 20% ; piran 1999 ; but , see also nemmen et al .",
    "the situation of an inner shell moving faster than an outer shell , which is a necessary condition for the is to produce , is unstable ( waxman & piran 1994 ) .    these difficulties of the is model have instigated the search for alternate models .",
    "some of them involve looking back into the prediction of the original fireball model .",
    "for example , ryde ( 2004 ) has shown for a few batse grbs , having single pulse , that the instantaneous spectrum is consistent with either a bb or a bb with a power - law ( bbpl ) spectrum ( see also ryde & peer 2009 ) .",
    "the reasons to choose single pulse are two - fold  ( a ) the original fireball model predicts single pulse and instantaneous bb radiation ; ( b ) if the spectral evolution is a pulse property rather than a burst property , a single pulse is an ideal system to study the spectral evolution and then one can apply the knowledge of a single pulse to a more complex grb .",
    "the bbpl model has sometimes shown superiority over the band function in the batse data .",
    "this is a very promising result because , this is the first step towards identifying the physical mechanism of the radiation .",
    "however , later it was found that more complex models may be required to fit a wider spectrum provided by fermi ( ryde et al .",
    "2010 ; burgess et al . 2011 ; guiriec et al .",
    "2013 ; basak & rao 2013  br13 , hereafter ) .",
    "it is shown that a model consisting of a band and a blackbody model ( band+bb ) is required to fit some of the long ( guiriec et al .",
    "2011 ; axelsson et al .",
    "2012 ) and short ( guiriec et al . 2013 ) grbs .",
    "interestingly , in a band+bb fit , the parameters of the band function are compatible with the synchrotron model prediction , while they are not for a fit with a band only function . band+bb",
    "scenario with a subdominant bb is not compatible with the genuine fireball model and requires a highly magnetized outflow close to the source and a low magnetization at large radii to explain the observations .",
    "in addition , the magnetization seems to vary from burst to burst ( guiriec et al . 2013 ) . in this context , it is important to examine the fermi grbs having single pulses employing various models .",
    "( 2012 ; lu12 hereafter ) have analyzed a set of fermi grbs .",
    "they have paid special attention to the single pulses .",
    "their motivation , however , was to find the variation of @xmath6 of band function . in this study",
    ", we examine various models and their parameter evolution for grbs having single pulses .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe our sample , followed by data analysis techniques . in section 3",
    ", we show our results .",
    "the major findings are summarized and discussed in section 4 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ t2 ]    @xmath8 deviation of the mean value of @xmath3 from the -3/2 `` line of death '' ( fast cooling ) in the units of @xmath9 is shown .",
    "@xmath10 is the reduced @xmath11 of the fit of @xmath3 values assuming the model @xmath12 .",
    "higher @xmath10 denotes higher deviation from the synchrotron model predicted photon index ( for fast cooling ) .",
    "+ @xmath13 band function compared to the bbpl model .",
    "f - test is performed to check the superiority of band function over the bbpl model for all the time - resolved spectrum of each grb .",
    "the reported values are the mean ( and standard deviation ) of the confidence level of f - test .",
    "we fit the lcs of all the grbs using equation  1 .",
    "these are shown in figure  [ lc ] .",
    "we note that norris model adequately captures the pulse profile of all the grbs .",
    "however , note that the @xmath10 are generally not good .",
    "this is due to the fact that the pulses , other than the broad structure , have very rapid variations ( see rao et al .",
    "these finer time variability can not be captured in a simple pulse structure . in the current study , we are interested to quantify broad pulse properties e.g. , width and asymmetry of the pulses .",
    "hence , the use of norris model is adequate for our purpose .    in table",
    "[ t1 ] , we report the parameters of norris model fit .",
    "the errors in the derived parameters are calculated by propagating the mean error of the norris model parameters ( see norris et al .",
    "uncertainty in p , however , is obtained by noting down the @xmath14 for different values of p because the correlated errors in @xmath15 and @xmath16 gives incorrect results , particularly for symmetric grbs . the width",
    "( w ) and asymmetry ( @xmath17 ) , however , are well determined .",
    "though these grbs have broad single pulses , we find that for grb 081207 , which is a very long grb compared to all others , at least two heavily overlapping pulses are present during the main bursting episode .",
    "also , for grb 110721a , we found that fitting two pulses is significantly better than a single pulse fitting ( an improvement of @xmath18 is obtained to the expense of 4 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "lu12 have suggested that the hts pulses are more asymmetric than the it pulses .",
    "but , from table  [ t1 ] we find that there are some exceptions to this consensus for our single pulse sample .",
    "for example , grb  100612a , which is a hts grb , is very symmetric ( @xmath17 is only @xmath19 ) .",
    "grb  090922a , despite being an it grb , is very asymmetric ( as high as @xmath20 ) .",
    "the highest asymmetry is shown by single pulse grb  100707a .",
    "we visually inspect this grb and find that the rising part is in fact very steep .",
    "hence , in order to get more data point in the rising part , we analyze the lc using 0.1 s bin size .",
    "we find the asymmetry , @xmath21 , which is indeed the highest among all the grbs .",
    "though we found two pulses in grb 110721a , one of these pulses shows even higher asymmetry @xmath22 .",
    "one of the two pulses of grb  081207 , an it grb , show high asymmetry ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "hence , we can not differentiate between hts and it grbs according to their asymmetric lcs .      as described in section 2.2 ,",
    "we extract the time - resolved spectra of the individual grbs by requiring a minimum background subtracted count per time bin . the time interval ( @xmath24 to @xmath25 ) and the number of bins ( n ) are listed in table  [ t1 ] . for grb  081207 , which has another pulse after 80 s ,",
    "the data is taken till 76 s. this selection , however , will not affect any conclusion regarding this grb .",
    "we also report the detectors used in our analysis in the last column of table  [ t1 ] .",
    "the results of the time - resolved spectroscopy for all the grbs are shown graphically in figure  [ grb1 ] through figure  [ grb9 ] .",
    "the upper panels show the kt variation of the bbpl and @xmath6 variation of the band function . we have shown the lcs of the individual grbs in this panel to compare the @xmath6 variation with the count rate variation . from this variation",
    "we can identify that the first 6 grbs are the hts grbs and the rest 3 are it grbs .",
    "note that the peak of bb occurs at @xmath263kt , and hence , in this panel , we have plotted 3kt instead of kt to compare the peak position given by the bbpl and band function fit .",
    "we note that there is a general agreement of evolution of these peaks , however , the peak of the bbpl fit is always found to be lower than the corresponding @xmath2 peak of the band function .    in the second panels from the top",
    ", we have shown the variation of @xmath3 of the band function and @xmath27 of the bbpl model .",
    "the parameter @xmath5 is often unconstrained or reaches the hard bound of -10 .",
    "hence , we do not show this parameter . in this panel",
    ", we show the `` synchrotron lines of death '' by two straight lines  one at -2/3 ( slow cooling regime ) and another at -3/2 ( fast cooling regime ) .",
    "the general trend of @xmath3 is higher at the beginning and lower in the later part .",
    "note that the value @xmath3 is always greater than the line at fast cooling regime ( -3/2 ) . to quantify the deviation of @xmath3 from the predicted -3/2 line , we device two methods : ( a ) the deviation of the mean value of @xmath3 from -3/2 in the units of @xmath9 and ( b ) the @xmath11 value of the fit to @xmath3 , assuming the model predicted @xmath3=-3/2 . in table  [ t2 ] ( column 4 ) , we have shown the mean values of @xmath3 for each grb .",
    "the error in the mean is 1@xmath9 , and it is calculated by using the two tailed errors of @xmath3 ( at nominal 90% confidence ) .",
    "the deviation of the mean from -3/2 value in the units of @xmath9 is shown in column 5 .",
    "we see a high deviation in each case .",
    "the @xmath14 ( shown in parenthesis ) is also high in each case denoting the significance of the trend . in some cases , it s value is greater than -2/3 , which is disallowed by synchrotron model for slow cooling electrons .",
    "this deviation from -2/3 line , however , is not very significant .",
    "for some hts grbs the deviations are significant : 40@xmath9 ( grb 100707a ) , 5.8@xmath9 ( grb  081224 ) and 5.0@xmath9 ( grb  110817a ) . for it grbs",
    "the deviations are consistent with zero ( within 1@xmath9 ) . for it grb  100528a , the mean value of @xmath3 is @xmath28 which is even within the slow cooling `` line of death '' at 8.8@xmath9 .",
    "we find two extreme cases .",
    "these are grb  110817a ( hts ) and grb  100528a ( it ) . in the former case ,",
    "@xmath3 values are always above the line at -2/3 and in the latter case @xmath3 values are always below the line .    in the third panels",
    ", we have shown the evolution of the photon flux for the two components of bbpl model .",
    "note that , the pl flux lags behind the bb flux .",
    "this behaviour is particularly significant for grb  081224 , grb  100707a and grb  110721a . in a recent paper , basak & rao ( 2013b )",
    "have shown that very high energy ( gev ) emission is expected for grbs which have delayed pl emission . for the three grbs in the present study , we also find reported lat detection ( lle data ) at 3.1@xmath9 , 3.7@xmath9 and 30.0@xmath9 , respectively ( ackermann et al .",
    "though we have not used the lat data of these grbs for spectroscopy , the lat detection is consistent with our earlier claim .",
    "finally , the fourth panels show the @xmath14 of various model fits . to compare the fit statistics of bbpl model with other models",
    ", we perform f - test between bbpl and band function . the confidence level ( cl ) that the alternative model ( band ) is better than the original hypothesis ( bbpl ) is calculated for all the time - resolved bins of the individual grbs .",
    "we then compute the mean and standard deviation of the cl .",
    "the corresponding values are reported in table  [ t2 ] .",
    "it is evident that the it pulses are adequately fit by bbpl model .",
    "the hts pulses , on the other hand , require a different model to fit the spectrum . however , band , mbbpl and 2bbpl are all equally good for this purpose .",
    "hence , one needs physical arguments to distinguish between these models .",
    "the results of all the grbs are summarized in table  [ t2 ] .",
    "we note that the grbs can be classified in 2 categories : hts and it .",
    "we note the following trends for hts and it grbs .",
    "first , note that a lat detection is reported only for hts class . for hts",
    "grbs , the value of @xmath3 is greater than -2/3 in 63.4% cases .",
    "the exception of this trend is shown by grb 110721a . excluding this grb",
    ", we obtain 74.6% of cases of hts grbs where @xmath3 is greater than -2/3 .",
    "the deviation of @xmath3 from -3/2 line are systematically high ( large @xmath9 deviation and high values of @xmath14 ) . the confidence level ( cl ) that the band model is better than the bbpl model has a mean value of 79.3% . in case of it",
    "grbs , the value of @xmath3 is greater than -2/3 in only 44% cases . as pointed out the mean values",
    "are greater only within 1@xmath9 deviation , and for one it grb ( namely , 100528a ) it is even less than -2/3 at 8.8@xmath9 . also , the cl that the band model is better than bbpl model has a mean value of only 67% . the only exception of the behaviour of @xmath3 is noted for the hts grb 090809b for which @xmath3 is greater than -2/3 in only 53.3% cases . however , note in figure  [ grb2 ] ( upper panel ) that the @xmath29 evolution is not strictly hard - to - soft . in figure  [ alpha_hts_it ] (",
    "left panel ) , we have plotted the @xmath3 values for hts and it grbs , with y - axis as time sequence . in the same plot ,",
    "we have indicated the -3/2 and -2/3 lines of death .",
    "note that @xmath3 values are always greater than the -3/2 line .",
    "in many cases the @xmath3 values are greater than the -2/3 line , especially for the hts grbs . the mean value of @xmath3 is -0.42 and -0.68 for hts and it grbs with dispersion of 0.72 and 0.50 , respectively .",
    "also there is a clear trend of the evolution of @xmath3  the values of @xmath3 decreases with time i.e. , the spectrum becomes softer .",
    "the four models used in our analysis are taken from br13 , who applied them to the brightest grbs having separable pulses ( grb  081221 and grb  090618 ) .",
    "the present results generally agree with the results obtained for those two bright grbs . in the present case",
    "too we find that the decomposition of the spectrum in terms of 2bbs or mbb and a power - law components significantly improves the fit over single bb with a pl .",
    "though the 2bbpl model gives better @xmath10 in all cases , the present analysis can not conclusively show whether the 2bbpl model is an approximation for some underlying complex spectral distribution . exploring this model further , basak & rao ( 2013b ) ,",
    "have shown some very promising results like prediction of lat emission from gbm only analysis .",
    "they have fitted the mev gbm data , without invoking the lat data , with the 2bbpl model and have shown that the pl flux , independent of the lat data , mimics the lat gev emission .",
    "the pl has a delayed onset and lingers at the later part , just as the same way as the lat flux .",
    "moreover , the pl fluence correlates with the lat fluence . in the present analysis",
    ", we find lat detection for three grbs ( grb  081224 , grb  100707a and grb  110721a ) which show similar behaviour ( a delayed onset of the power - law component which lingers at the later phase ) .",
    "another interesting feature we find that the 2bbs of the 2bbpl model are highly correlated . in figure  [ kt_corr ] , we have plotted the temperatures of the two bbs of the 2bbpl model .",
    "it is clear that the two temperatures are highly correlated .",
    "this correlation shows that either there is some underlying physical reason for the two black body components or they are connected to each other because they happen to be an approximation for some more complex spectral shape .",
    "to summarize , we have collected a sample of gbm grbs having single pulse .",
    "we have studied the individual pulses in the time and energy domain and found some interesting results .",
    "we found that the band model always gives better fit to the data compared to the bbpl model .",
    "the @xmath10 of the band model is comparable to mbbpl and 2bbpl model .",
    "however , the values of @xmath3 , in many cases , are greater than -2/3 , the limit due to the synchrotron emission from electrons in the slow cooling regime .",
    "hence , the spectrum can not be fully synchrotron . hence",
    ", neither bbpl nor band can be considered consistent with the underlying physical mechanism of the prompt emission .",
    "it is possible that both thermal and non - thermal emissions contribute to the total emission . in this regard , the 2bbpl and the mbbpl model are preferred over bbpl model .",
    "we found that the hts grbs have generally larger values of @xmath3 compared to the it grbs .",
    "also , the @xmath3 has a decreasing trend with time , making the spectrum softer .",
    "this signifies that the spectrum has a different origin than synchrotron at the beginning , but later synchrotron emission may dominate .",
    "we found that the peak energy of the bbpl model gives lower value than the corresponding band function .",
    "as the peak energy of the spectrum is used for the correlation studies in the prompt emission ( amati et al .",
    "2002 ; yonetoku et al .",
    "2004 ; ghirlanda et al . 2004 ; basak & rao et al .",
    "2012a ) , it is essential to determine the correct peak energy of the spectrum .",
    "if the underlying reason for the @xmath6 and isotropic equivalent energy correlation ( @xmath6-@xmath30 : the amati correlation ) is some basic physical process , a correct model description and a proper identification of @xmath6 would be required to improve the amati - type correlation ( note that @xmath6 and 3 kt are note strictly correlated with each other and the difference varies between grbs ) . investigating a pulse",
    "- wise amati correlation ( e.g. , see krimm et al .",
    "2009 ; basak & rao 2013c ) with different models to derive the @xmath6 can provide inputs to strengthen the amati correlation as well as to identify the physical process responsible for the correlation .",
    "note that a hts evolution , by its nature violate time - resolved @xmath6-@xmath30 correlation , because the high values of @xmath6 is obtained even when the flux ( and hence @xmath30 ) is low .",
    "for example , axelsson et al . (",
    "2012 ) have found @xmath31 mev during the initial bins of grb 110721a .",
    "hence , time - resolved amati correlation is likely to fail .",
    "basak & rao ( 2012b ) have studied amati correlation by replacing time - resolved @xmath6 and @xmath30 by pulse average @xmath6 and total @xmath30 of a pulse .",
    "a pulse average @xmath6 , due to the crucial averaging over a pulse , will not show the effect of hts evolution history , thus restoring the amati correlation .",
    "note that , pulses , rather than time - resolved bins are preferred as the pulses behave as independent entities in grbs . in this context",
    "one reasonable choice is peak energy at the zero fluence ( @xmath32 ) as done by basak & rao ( 2012b ) . unlike @xmath6 , which is a pulse average quantity ,",
    "@xmath32 is a constant for each pulse and correlates better with the total @xmath30 .",
    "consequently , the strong pulse - wise @xmath32-@xmath30 correlation indicates that a pulse with high initial peak energy may have started with a low flux , but eventually it will give rise to high total flux of the pulse .",
    "however , one can not use the it class for such correlation study , as it grbs , by their nature will not give such @xmath32 .",
    "hence , one can use pulse average peak energy for such correlation study , which does not depend on hts or it evolution ( basak & rao 2013c )    finally , we want to remind that the 2bbpl model has some interesting features like highly correlated bb temperatures .",
    "the pl component of this model fitted to the prompt kev - mev emission has been shown to correlate with the high energy gev emission ( basak & rao 2013b ) .",
    "these definitely point towards some underlying physical process .",
    "hence , it is important to find the existence of the 2bbs in the prompt emission sepctrum .",
    "making similar spectral analysis for grbs with better low energy measurement ( like that from _ swift_/x - ray telescope ( xrt ) ) would clarify these further .",
    "as the temperature of the two correlated bbs decrease with time , the lower bb may show up in the low energy detector like xrt during the late prompt emission phase",
    ". however , such detailed study needs good knowledge of detector systematics and cross - detector calibration . in basak & rao ( 2012b )",
    ", we have shown that spectral analysis using bat and gbm gives systematics difference in the results .",
    "though one needs to find out ways to perform joint fitting , the procedure is quite involved and beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "this research has made use of data obtained through the heasarc online service , provided by the nasa / gsfc , in support of nasa high energy astrophysics programs .",
    "we thank the referee for valuable comments and numerous suggestions especially to make quantitative statements of the results ."
