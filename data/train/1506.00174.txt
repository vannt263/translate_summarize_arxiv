    "although long discussed @xcite , the existence of sodium hydride , nah , is yet to be confirmed in any astronomical bodies .",
    "notably few metal hydrides have been detected in the interstellar medium and searches for nah in both dense clouds @xcite and diffuse clouds @xcite have so far only yielded upper limits .",
    "similarly an attempt to detect the long - wavelength signature for nah in the atmosphere of jupiter and saturn @xcite also proved negative .    while spectroscopic data for long - wavelength studies of nah has been the subject of the laboratory studies @xcite , and are compiled in the cdms database @xcite , the situation is less clear at infrared and visible wavelengths .",
    "a recent work on m - dwarf models by @xcite identified nah as one of only three molecules for which the necessary spectroscopic data is missing .",
    "this is despite the fact that the @xmath3 band of nah should give an observable feature at visible wavelengths .",
    "it is this situation we address here .",
    "we note that the next lowest - lying singlet electronic excited states of nah are the @xmath4  @xmath1 @xcite and the shallow @xmath5  @xmath6 state @xcite whose yet to be observed spectra lie in the ultraviolet , probably at around 3000  .",
    "the large dipole moments of nah , as well as supposedly making it more amenable to astronomical detection , has also excited the interest of scientists working on ultra - cold molecules @xcite . in particular , it has been suggested that these dipoles should enhance the prospects of molecule formation by radiative association at very low temperatures @xcite .",
    "the exomol project aims to provide line lists of spectroscopic transitions for key molecular species which are likely to be important in the atmospheres of extrasolar planets and cool stars ; its aims , scope and methodology have been summarised by @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "ro - vibrational and rovibronic transition lists are computed for the only two stable isotopes of sodium hydride , @xmath7nah and @xmath7nad .",
    "these line lists consider transitions within and between the two lowest electronic states of nah , @xmath0  @xmath1 and @xmath2  @xmath1 .",
    "the resulting line lists are comprehensive and should be valid up to the 7000  k temperature range .",
    "as with other diatomic systems studied as part of the exomol project @xcite , we treated nah using both _ ab initio _ and experimental data .",
    "@xcite used a direct potential fit analysis to generate accurate potential energy curves for the ground and first singlet excited states of nah ( @xmath0  @xmath8 and ` avoided crossing ' @xmath2  @xmath8 ) .",
    "these curves ( also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pecs ] ) were then used as input to the program level version 8.2 @xcite to produce accurate nuclear motion energy levels , wavefunctions and hence transition intensities .",
    "a full discussion of how the potential energy curves were derived can be found in @xcite , which also gives a comprehensive survey of previous laboratory work on the spectrum of nah and nad .",
    "we note that the experimental data used by @xcite to determine their curves is insufficient to characterise the last 1000 @xmath9  of the excited @xmath2  @xmath8 below dissociation , where the a state undergoes another avoided crossing @xcite .",
    "the dissocation limit of this state was constrained by the atomic limit neglecting spin - orbit coupling @xcite and ro - vibrational states computed in this region must be considered approximate .",
    "_ ab initio _",
    "dipole moments were computed on a dense , uniformly - spaced grid of 220 points from @xmath10=2.40 to @xmath10=13.40 a@xmath11 in steps of 0.05 a@xmath11 .",
    "dipoles were computed as expectation value of a multi - reference configuration interaction ( mrci ) calculation using a full valence complete active space model , which distributes the two outer electrons among 5 orbitals , and the aug - cc - pwcv5z basis set .",
    "orbitals were produced using a state - averaged complete active space self consistent field ( casscf ) which considered both the @xmath0 and @xmath2 states .",
    "the core 2s2p electrons were correlated at the mrci stage .",
    "a single run takes about 4 minutes .",
    "figure  [ fig : dipoles ] shows our two diagonal dipole moment curves and the off - diagonal @xmath2@xmath0 transition moment .",
    "the diagonal dipoles have a somewhat unusual shape which is undoubted associated with the changing character of the nah wavefunction as a function of geometry .",
    "the dipole moment of ground state nah is has been determined experimentally @xcite , but not particularly accurately .",
    "conversely there have been quite a number of theoretical studies on the problem .",
    "the most recent is a comprehensive calculation of all three moment considered here by @xcite , who also provide a comprehensive survey of the previous literature .",
    "our results are in excellent agreement with those @xcite , who also find the various turning points in the dipole curves which are a feature of our calculations .",
    "our dipole moment points , which are provided in the supplementary material , were input directly into level .",
    "partition functions for nah and nad were calculated by summing over all energy levels calculated .",
    "@xcite have recently shown that inclusion of quasibound ( resonance or pre - dissociative ) states can influence the partition function sums at higher temperatures . here",
    "we present partition functions for both nah and nad obtained by summing both over all the truly bound states of the system and also by including quasibound states determined using level .",
    "table [ tab : partition ] compares these two methods and suggests that below 2000 k the influence of quasibound states on the partition sum can safely be neglected .",
    "above this temperature the quasibound states have a small but increasing influence .",
    "however for consistency with our previous work and because we do not consider transitions to quasibound states , we ignore the effect of quasibound states below . for high accuracy work at higher temperatures this approximation may need to be re - visited .",
    "table [ tab : partition ] also compares our nah partition functions with those of @xcite and the cdms database @xcite .",
    "our results cover a larger temperature range : cdms values only go up to 300  k for nah , and sauval & tatum only claim their values are accurate for 1000  9000  k. the latter values were multiplied by the factor 8 in order to explicitly account for the nuclear spin degeneracy in accord with the hitran @xcite convention , used by exomol ; the cdms partition function had to be multiplied by 2 . according with the convention of cdms ,",
    "the common factors in partition functions are usually divided to keep them small @xcite . after these adjustments results give good agreement with sauval & tatum and cdms in the appropriate temperature ranges , although there is a slight divergence from sauval & tatum s values at higher temperature ranges .",
    "a polynomial fit of this work s partition functions is given in in table [ tab : fitting ] .",
    "the values in table [ tab : fitting ] are coefficients in the following equation : @xmath12 which was based on a series expansion used by @xcite .",
    ".partition function of nah compared with other sources [ cols=\"^ , > , > , > , > \" , ]",
    "we present comprehensive line lists for nah and nad .",
    "these are based on the direct solution of the nuclear motion schrdinger equation using potential energy curves obtained by fitting to experimental data of measured transitions , all calculated by @xcite .",
    "these were combined with a new _ ab initio _",
    "dipole moment curve to produce comprehensive line lists for these two species .",
    "the strong @xmath2@xmath0 feature about 380 nm should provide a signature for nah in the atmospheres of cool stars , brown dwarfs and exoplanets .",
    "however , the shallow nature of the upper @xmath2  @xmath1 electronic state meansi that this feature is predicted to be rather broad .",
    "while this means that nah can make a significant contribution to the opacity , it is likely to make this feature difficult to detect .",
    "nah was recently identified one of only two key diatomic species whose spectral data was completely missing from m - dwarf models @xcite . a study on the other of these species , alh , has just been completed and will be reported soon .",
    "this work was supported by the erc under the advanced investigator project 267219 and a wolfson royal society research merit award .",
