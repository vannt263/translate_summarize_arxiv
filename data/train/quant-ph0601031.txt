    "<S> it is shown that to obtain accurate results for the atom - wall interaction at short separations , one should use the complete tabulated optical data for the complex refractive index of the wall material and the accurate dynamic polarizability of an atom . at relatively large separations in the case of a metal wall , </S>",

    "<S> the van der waals and casimir - polder forces acting between dilute individual atoms , confined in a magnetic trap , and a wall may influence the stability of a condensate and the effective size of the trap @xcite . as was shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the study of the collective oscillations of the bose - einstein condensate can provide a sensitive test of dispersion forces . </S>",
    "<S> this prediction was later supported both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> dispersion interaction between an atom and a wall is also taken into account in quantum reflection of cold atoms on a surface @xcite and in dynamical interaction effects of fast atoms and molecules with solid surfaces @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> currently the new asymptotic behavior of the surface - atom interaction out of thermal equilibrium has been advanced @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> below we use the generic name  casimir - polder \" for all atom - wall interactions of dispersion nature because the pure nonretarded regime occurs at separations from zero to a few nanometers only .    </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical basis for the description of the casimir - polder interaction between an atom at a separation @xmath0 from a flat wall at temperature @xmath1 in thermal equilibrium is given by the lifshitz - type formula for the free energy [ 1012 ] @xmath2 \\vphantom{\\sum\\limits_{l=1}^{\\infty}}\\right\\}. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath3 is the atomic dynamic polarizability , @xmath4 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath5 are the dimensionless matsubara frequencies , @xmath6 is the characteristic frequency of the casimir - polder interaction , and the reflection coefficients for two independent polarizations of electromagnetic field are defined as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the permittivity of wall material computed at imaginary matsubara frequencies . for dielectrics @xmath9/[\\varepsilon(0)+1]$ ] and for metals </S>",

    "<S> @xcite were used . </S>",
    "<S> as is seen in table 1 , the use of the ideal metal or the static dielectric permittivity approximations leads to errors up to 16% for metal and 78% for dielectric </S>",
    "<S> . these errors slowly decrease with increasing separation between the atom and the wall . </S>",
    "<S> the plasma model is a better approximation than the ideal metal approximation . </S>",
    "<S> it results in errors of about 5% at the shortest separations and becomes sufficiently exact when the separation approaches 150 nm . </S>",
    "<S> the use of the static atomic polarizability would result in much greater errors and for this reason it is omitted from table 1 .        at large separations , from 150 nm to a few micrometers , </S>",
    "<S> the effects of the atomic dynamic polarizability play a more important role than the effects of the finite conductivity of the metal . the single - oscillator model , however , is sufficient to achieve the required accuracy . the dielectric properties of a metal </S>",
    "<S> can be approximated by the plasma model . for dielectrics and semiconductors both tabulated optical data and the ninham - parsegian representation for the dielectric permittivity @xcite are suitable for obtaining accurate results . </S>",
    "<S> for sufficiently large separations one can use the static dielectric permittivity of the wall . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate these features using the example of a he@xmath12 atom near an au wall . due to the strongly nonmonotonous dependence of the free energy on separation , we plot along the vertical axis the ratio of the free energy to the casimir - polder energy @xmath42 of an atom near a wall made of ideal metal at @xmath43 . as is seen from fig .  1 , at separations @xmath44 </S>",
    "<S> m all approaches lead to approximately equal values of the free energy .    to conclude , results such as those presented in the columns labeled ( a ) in table  1 and by line  1 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 can be used in interpretation of precision experiments on atom - surface interactions . </S>"
