    "@xmath19 , which we may assume to lie in the @xmath20-plane .",
    "this means that the set of joints and the set of bars are invariant under the group of translations @xmath21 where @xmath22    we define a _",
    "@xmath0-periodic triangulated origami _",
    "@xmath1 to be a @xmath0-periodic bar - joint framework whose infinite underlying ( structure ) graph @xmath16 is simple and is associated with a triangulation of the plane .",
    "this is the genus zero case of a @xmath0-periodic triangulated surface and we shall confine attention here to this case .",
    "it follows that @xmath16 has a set of _ facial @xmath5-cycles _ corresponding to the faces of @xmath1 and each edge of @xmath16 is incident to two faces . for our generic considerations",
    "there is in fact no loss of generality in assuming that the @xmath20-plane projection of a generic building block motif for @xmath1 gives a planar graph , and so the projection of @xmath1 is identifiable with @xmath16 .    an _ origami polynomial _",
    "@xmath4 for @xmath1 is determined by a choice of a building block motif @xmath23 for the given period vectors , and is equal to the determinant of the @xmath24 square matrix function @xmath25 defined below , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the motif notation here follows the formalism given in owen and power @xcite , power @xcite and badri et - al @xcite .",
    "thus the joints ( resp .",
    "bars ) of @xmath1 are obtained from the translates of the joints ( resp .",
    "bars ) in @xmath28 ( resp .",
    "@xmath29 ) under the action of @xmath30 . as a bar - joint framework @xmath31",
    "the joints of @xmath1 appear in the periodic framework vector @xmath32 , where @xmath33 ranges over the finite index set for the joints in @xmath28 , and @xmath34 .",
    "the edges of @xmath16 correspond to the bars of @xmath1 and we have @xmath35 for all @xmath36 .        the matrix function @xmath25 may be directly specified in terms of a labelling of its rows by the bars @xmath37 in @xmath29 and by a labelling of triples of columns by the joints @xmath38 in @xmath28 .",
    "the row for a bar @xmath39 of @xmath29 with endpoints @xmath40 , with @xmath41 , has at most @xmath42 nonzero entries and these appear in the @xmath42 columns for the pair @xmath43 .",
    "these columns are labelled @xmath44 . for @xmath45",
    "the row for @xmath39 takes the the following form , where @xmath46 is the bar vector @xmath47 : @xmath48 if @xmath49 then the row takes the form @xmath50 and is only determined up to sign .",
    "we say that in the case @xmath49 the bar @xmath39 is _ reflexive_. this matrix function is also known as the _ symbol function _ of @xmath1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the origami polynomial associated with the motif is @xmath51 .",
    "in fact this polynomial is essentially uniquely determined by the choice of period vectors , rather than the motif @xmath52 , the only ambiguity being a monomial multiplier @xmath53 .",
    "( see @xcite . ) the rum spectrum @xmath54 is defined to be the zero set of @xmath4 on the torus @xmath8 .",
    "it may be interpreted , on the one hand , as the set of multi - phases of phase - periodic infinitesimal flexes , or , on the other hand , as the set of reduced wave vectors of the zero energy modes in the spectrum of phonon dispersion curves .",
    "a proof of this equivalence is given in power @xcite .",
    "we remark that despite the dependence of the set @xmath54 on a choice of motif , the term _ spectrum _ is appropriate in a technical sense since @xmath54 may be viewed as the union of the bohr spectra of almost periodic infinitesimal flexes @xcite .    from the point of view of a periodic bar - joint framework a periodic origami @xmath1",
    "is said to be _ generic _ , or , more precisely , generic modulo periodicity , if , up to some translation , the coordinates of the motif joints form an algebraically independent set .",
    "thus , paradoxically perhaps , a @xmath0-periodic origami whose motif has a single joint and , necessarily , @xmath5 coplanar incident bars , is generic in this sense , despite being planar .",
    "also , more generally , if @xmath52 contains a reflexive bar , then @xmath1 contains a set of parallel linear subframeworks .",
    "we say that an origami @xmath1 is _ properly generic _ if it is generic and there are no reflexive bars in the motif for @xmath1 .",
    "[ e : ex1]let @xmath1 be a periodic origami , as above , whose motif has a joint set @xmath28 consisting of a single joint .",
    "then @xmath1 a referred to as a _ base origami_. suppose that the period vectors are orthogonal unit vectors .",
    "then we may assume that the joint is positioned at the origin , and the bars of the motif have their other joints at @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the matrix function for @xmath1 is the function @xmath57 on the torus in @xmath58 given by @xmath59 it follows that the origami polynomial vanishes identically and the rum spectrum consists of the entire torus @xmath8 .",
    "this is true also for general base origami since these have similar matrix functions .",
    "it is convenient , for diagrammatic depictions , to assume that , as in figure [ f : projection ] , the geometry is such that @xmath52 has a projection which is a planar graph .",
    "let us say that a joint of a bar in @xmath29 which is not in @xmath28 is a _",
    "ghost joint_. it is similarly convenience to assume that the motif is chosen so that the ghost joints have one of the three forms @xmath60 or @xmath61 .      in the context of phonon modes and surface phonons in condensed matter",
    "the suggestive term _ topologically protected mode _ has been used to indicate that upon small periodic perturbation of the geometric parameters the periodic perturbed structure possess a nearby mode with nearby spectral point ( wave vector ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the modes that may be present due to internal symmetries and which therefore vanish upon almost all small perturbations . in the analysis of topological insulators for example",
    "there is extensive literature concerned with identifying such topological protectedness and the underlying reasons for it .",
    "similarly , it is of interest to determine the perturbationally stable mechanical modes in a critically coordinated periodic bar - joint structure .",
    "one guarantee of such stability , in the case of periodic bar - joint frameworks , is if it happens to be known that in a neighbourhood of the spectral point @xmath62 for the mode the spectrum is a ( nonextremal ) level curve of a real - valued function . in this way",
    "the real - valued determination of the rum spectrum underlies the existence and persistence of modes under periodic perturbation .",
    "we note that it is elementary to see that a palindromic polynomial @xmath63 with real coefficients has a zero set on @xmath8 which is locally determined as the zero set of a real - valued continuous function .",
    "indeed , @xmath64 for some integers @xmath65 , by assumption , and so the function @xmath66 is real - valued on @xmath8 .",
    "a similar argument holds in the antipalindromic case .",
    "we now state the main theorem , define various terms , and outline the structure of the proof .    [",
    "t : palindrome ] let @xmath1 be a generic @xmath0-periodic triangulated origami",
    ". then @xmath1 has the palindrome property .",
    "in fact we shall see that @xmath1 has a stronger palindrome property associated with subdeterminants of the matrix function @xmath67 .",
    "also we show that @xmath12 is palindromic , rather than antipalindromic , if @xmath15 does not have an odd number of loop edges .        a _ periodic joint - splitting move _ , @xmath68 , is a construction move which creates a generic @xmath0-periodic triangulated origami @xmath69 , with the same period vectors as those of @xmath1 , such that the joints of @xmath69 include the joints of @xmath1 , together with a new joint orbit arising from a face - respecting joint - splitting move for the joint @xmath70 and two incident bars @xmath71 .",
    "this is indicated , in planar projected form , in figure [ f : uncoloured ] .",
    "in particular , we may define a motif for @xmath69 with @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "moreover @xmath74 is obtained by adding @xmath5 _ new bars _ incident to @xmath75 , namely @xmath76 , and by replacing a consecutive set of bars @xmath77 , between @xmath78 and @xmath79 , by the _",
    "carried bars _ @xmath80 .",
    "the proof of the theorem depends on the following two parts , the first of which depends on a construction scheme for _ triangulated torus graphs _",
    ", as defined below",
    ". the second part of the proof requires an analysis of the effect of joint splitting on the origami polynomial .",
    "every generic @xmath0-periodic origami is constructible from a base origami by a sequence of periodic joint - splitting moves .",
    "the strong palindromic property , defined in section 5 , is preserved by joint - splitting moves .",
    "we make use of the quotient graph @xmath15 of @xmath1 endowed with an inherited facial structure .",
    "this is the quotient of the structure graph @xmath16 of @xmath1 with respect to the natural graph automorphisms induced by translation by the periodicity vectors .",
    "we may also define it as follows .",
    "the _ quotient graph _ @xmath81 of @xmath52 is the multi - graph with vertex set @xmath82 equal to @xmath28 , as a set , and where @xmath83 is obtained from @xmath29 by identifying the joints of bars in @xmath29 with their unique representatives in @xmath28 .",
    "thus @xmath84 is a multi - graph in the sense of having multiple edges and loops .",
    "also @xmath84 inherits a _ facial structure _ from @xmath16 in the following sense .",
    "the faces of @xmath1 are the _ edge @xmath5-cycles _ @xmath85 given by the unordered triples of bars bordering the triangular faces ( or panels ) of the bar - joint framework @xmath1 .",
    "the faces of @xmath84 are defined to be the corresponding edge triples .",
    "note however that whereas the faces of @xmath1 have distinct triples of joints there may be faces of @xmath84 whose edges have coincident vertices .",
    "for examples , the base origami have a quotient graph with a single vertex , @xmath5 edges and @xmath0 faces .",
    "the graph @xmath84 is independent of the choice of motif and coincides with @xmath15 .",
    "it is evident that @xmath84 is realisable as a graph on the torus with edges represented by smooth curves which do not overlap .",
    "to see this one need only construct the torus as the ( opposite sides ) identification space of the parallelogram defined by the @xmath0-period vectors . in these representations",
    "the torus is equal to the closure of the union of connected ( open ) regions of the torus that are interior to embedded facial @xmath5-cycles of edges .",
    "the quotient graphs so defined are referred to as _ triangulated torus graphs_. however , recall that we assume throughout that the structure graph @xmath16 is a simple graph .",
    "it follows that @xmath16 is @xmath5-connected and it follows from this that @xmath84 is @xmath5-connected .",
    "we thus have the following elementary categorical correspondence .",
    "_ there is a bijection between @xmath5-connected triangulated torus graphs , defined as identification graphs , and the structure graphs of the periodic triangulated origami @xmath1_.    in considering the construction of periodic origami by joint splitting moves , it is helpful to consider _ face diagrams _ which give a planar depiction of the faces of @xmath84 that are incident to @xmath70 , or a depiction of the faces incident to @xmath86 in @xmath87 , as in figure [ f : uncoloured ] for example .",
    "figure [ f : edgesub ] indicates that we may also view the joint - splitting move as the result of bar substitutions which derives @xmath88 from @xmath52 .",
    "if there is no loop edge with vertex @xmath70 then we may formally define the face graph for vertex @xmath70 to be the planar graph determined by the faces that are incident to @xmath89 .",
    "if on the other hand @xmath70 supports one or several loop edges then the incidence of faces to the vertex @xmath70 can be indicated on an identification space for the torus , or part of the torus .",
    "figure [ f : vsplitbase ] indicates a vertex splitting move on the base quotient graph which has two faces , one of which is labelled .",
    "figure [ f : refledgefacegraph ] indicates the results of two vertex splitting moves for a vertex on a loop edge ( in the left hand diagram ) . in the middle diagram the ( vertical ) loop edge becomes a carried edge ( which is not a loop ) . in the rightmost diagram the loop edge plays",
    "the role of one of the split edges and remains in @xmath90 .",
    "it is straightforward to see that in general it is possible for a vertex - splitting move to increase the number of loops by @xmath7 .     in @xmath84 , and for the vertices @xmath91 in @xmath87.,width=340 ]",
    "every generic @xmath0-periodic triangulated origami is constructible from a base origami by a sequence of periodic joint - splitting moves .    the periodic joint - splitting move provides a natural vertex - splitting move @xmath92 at the level of quotient graphs . in view of the discussions above",
    "it suffices that to show that if the @xmath5-connected triangulated torus graph @xmath90 has more than one vertex then it is the result of a vertex - splitting move on a @xmath5-connected triangulated torus graph .",
    "let @xmath93 be distinct adjacent vertices of @xmath90 and let @xmath94 and @xmath95 be the two faces of @xmath90 that are incident to the edge @xmath78 .",
    "consider the triangulated torus graph @xmath96 defined by the operation of edge contraction on @xmath90 for the edge @xmath78 .",
    "if there are no properly triangulated @xmath5-cycles of edges of the form @xmath97 then it follows that @xmath96 is @xmath5-connected .",
    "it remains to consider the case that there does exists an obstacle @xmath98 to the contraction of @xmath78 .",
    "such an edge cycle is indicated in figure [ f : contraction ] .",
    "however in this case the graph formed by the triangulation of @xmath99 corresponds to a @xmath5-connected triangulation of a sphere . for such triangulations",
    "it is well known that there exists an interior edge ( one other than @xmath100 ) which contracts to yield a simple graph which is also a @xmath5-connected triangulation of the sphere or which is a @xmath5-cycle .",
    "( see the appendix of @xcite for example . )",
    "it follows that the contraction of this edge in @xmath84 gives a @xmath5-connected graph @xmath101 which is the quotient graph of a periodic origami , as required .",
    "the same argument shows that every properly generic periodic origami is obtained by joint splitting from one which has a motif containing four joints .",
    "[ l : propgeneric ] every properly generic @xmath0-periodic origami is constructible from a properly generic origami with @xmath102 by a sequence of periodic joint - splitting moves .",
    "it is a simple matter to enumerate the four - jointed motifs of the lemma .",
    "we remark that , on the other hand , it is a more complicated issue to identify the uncontractible triangulations of the torus which are _ strict triangulations _ in the sense that there are no @xmath0-cycles or loop edges . for this , see lawrencenko @xcite .",
    "we now introduce a key tool for understanding how the origami polynomial changes under joint - splitting moves , namely the indexing of the terms in the expansion of the determinant of @xmath67 by oriented colourings of the edges of @xmath15 .",
    "recall that a nonreflexive bar @xmath39 in @xmath29 with endpoints joints @xmath103 , for the vertex classes @xmath43 in @xmath28 and @xmath41 , determines the entry @xmath104 in the column labelled @xmath105 and the entry @xmath106 in column for @xmath107 .",
    "we view the act of choosing one of these two entries as assigning a direction to the bar @xmath39 , or , equivalently , to its edge in @xmath84 ) and assigning the label @xmath108 , or an associated colour to indicate the coordinate choice .",
    "specifically we view the choice of the @xmath105 entry as assigning the directed edge @xmath109 , with @xmath110 as source joint , and the choice of the second @xmath107 entry as assigning the directed edge @xmath111 with @xmath112 as source .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath39 is a reflexive bar , with @xmath49 , with a corresponding loop edge in @xmath84 , then we view the choice of the entry in column @xmath105 as assigning the label @xmath108 to @xmath39 .",
    "also we view @xmath39 as a directed edge , so that it contributes to the outdegree of @xmath89 .",
    "an _ oriented colouring",
    "_ @xmath113 of @xmath29 ( resp .",

    "we next relate oriented colourings of @xmath29 to terms in the expansion of the determinant of @xmath117 .",
    "note that an oriented colouring @xmath113 determines , and is determined by , a choice for each row of @xmath57 of one of the defined entries of that row in such a way that there are no repeated column choices .",
    "expanding @xmath118 in terms of bijections @xmath119 between the set of @xmath120 rows and the set of @xmath121 columns , we have @xmath122 noting the sparsity of the matrix function @xmath57 we may omit various zero terms in this sum of @xmath123 terms to obtain a sum indexed over the oriented colourings of @xmath29 .",
    "thus @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the set of oriented colourings and where @xmath126 is the signed @xmath127-fold product of entries of @xmath57 associated with @xmath113 .",

    "we define the _ monomial degree _ of the oriented colouring @xmath113 to be @xmath131 in this case .",
    "in general however @xmath126 is a signed scalar multiple of a polynomial , in @xmath132 with integral coefficients .      by a _ local oriented colouring _",
    "@xmath133 for a vertex @xmath70 of @xmath84 we mean a directing and colouring of the edges that have incidence with the vertex @xmath70 and which is induced by restricting an oriented colouring @xmath113 .",
    "we write @xmath134 to indicate this relationship .    in figure",
    "[ f : uncoloured ] we have indicated local oriented colourings for a vertex - splitting move on a vertex @xmath70 relative to the incident edges @xmath135 , @xmath136 . also we assume that @xmath70 is not on a loop edge of @xmath137 .",
    "although the joints of @xmath138 should be labelled differently from those of @xmath28 we find it convenient not to do so in view of the evident correspondence . the left hand part of figure [ f : vsplitcoloured ] indicates a local oriented colouring @xmath133 for @xmath70 , with the three inwardly directed bars to @xmath70 unlabelled .",
    "there are exactly three outwardly directed edges from @xmath70 with distinct colours , or labels @xmath139 , as indicated .",
    "although the @xmath113-inward directed bars in the figure do not have an indicated colour / label their colouring is implied by the @xmath113-colouring of the bars that are not incident to @xmath70 .",
    "in general there are a number of separate _ types _ of local oriented colouring depending on the disposition of the three outward bars at @xmath70 relative to the edges @xmath71 of the joint - splitting move .",
    "we identify these various types below .",
    "we also identify the ways in which an oriented colouring @xmath113 may be extended to an oriented colouring @xmath140 of @xmath90 by assigning colours to the new edges and the carried edges .",
    "we shall see that in all cases there are @xmath5 edges that may be coloured freely , and so in all cases there are @xmath42 oriented colouring extensions @xmath140 of @xmath113 .    in left hand diagram of figure",

    "we call these types ( b ) , ( c ) , ( d ) and ( e ) , respectively .",

    "for example , if the @xmath5 outward directed edges from @xmath70 are identified as carried edges , so that at the level of the move @xmath68 the corresponding bars are carried bars , then the framework @xmath69 is an alternative generic realisation of the framework obtained by a joint - splitting move of type ( b ) . in particular",

    "<S> a recent `` hidden symmetry '' conjecture of b. gin - ge chen et al is resolved , concerning the dimension of the mechanical modes of a generic @xmath0-periodic triangulated surface @xmath1 in @xmath2 whose structure graph corresponds to a triangular tiling of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce an indexing of the terms in an associated sparse determinant @xmath4 by means of oriented @xmath5-colourings of the underlying sparse graph , and use this and vertex splitting arguments to show that @xmath6 is palindromic or antipalindromic , up to a shift index . </S>",
    "<S> this implies the conjectured dimension @xmath7 phenomenon for these surfaces . as a corollary we obtain the topological stability of the generic modes of a @xmath7-periodic triangulated nanotube .        </S>",
    "<S> an infinite @xmath0-periodic triangulated combinatorial surface in @xmath2 , considered as a bar - joint framework , may also be viewed as a @xmath0-periodic origami with edge - hinged rigid triangular faces . </S>",
    "<S> such origami , in the case planar structure graphs , as well as more general nontriangulated kirigami , were examined recently by chen , liu , evans , paulose , cohen , vitelli , and santangelo @xcite from the point of view of the analysis of the spectrum of mechanical modes , or rigid unit modes ( rums ) . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen as part of a more general endeavour in theoretical physics to understand modes , elasticity and phonons in critically coordinated lattices . </S>",
    "<S> see for example dove et al @xcite , kane and lubensky @xcite , lubensky et al @xcite , stenull et al @xcite and wegner @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we give here a proof that the rum spectrum of a generic @xmath0-periodic bar - joint framework @xmath1 with planar triangulated structure graph is determined by the zero set of a real - valued continuous function on the @xmath0-torus @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular this resolves a striking conjecture given in @xcite that the dimension of mechanical modes of @xmath1 is typically equal to @xmath7 rather than @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> this fact is surprising since in the generic case there are no geometric symmetries beyond the given periodicity , and the rum dimension of general @xmath0-periodic critically coordinated bar - joint framework is expected to be equal to @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed the dimension here is the algebraic variety dimension for the intersection of the unit @xmath0-torus @xmath8 with the zero set @xmath10 of a complex polynomial @xmath4 with real coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> also this intersection is equal to the intersection of the sets @xmath11 and each of these is part of a @xmath7-dimensional curve .    </S>",
    "<S> it is known that the dimension @xmath7 property for the rum spectrum follows from the conjecture in @xcite that the origami polynomials @xmath12 are palindromic . </S>",
    "<S> this means that , as a function on the @xmath0-torus , the complex conjugate @xmath13 agrees with @xmath4 up to a multiplicative multinomial factor @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> we prove that this is true if @xmath1 is properly generic . </S>",
    "<S> moreover we show that in the general generic case , for which @xmath1 may have linear subframeworks , that @xmath12 is either palindromic or antipalindromic .    </S>",
    "<S> the proof has two parts . </S>",
    "<S> the first part is a graph - theoretic reduction argument which shows that @xmath1 may be obtained from a _ base origami _ , with a single joint orbit , by a finite sequence of periodic joint - splitting moves . </S>",
    "<S> the second part is a combinatorial algebraic argument showing the preservation of a general _ palindrome property _ under the periodic joint - splitting moves . </S>",
    "<S> this property means that @xmath12 is either palindromic or antipalindromic and we show that the latter case holds if and only if the quotient structure graph @xmath15 has an odd number of loop edges .    the origami polynomial is a sparse determinant , that is , the determinant of a sparse function matrix which in this case is determined by a building block motif for @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> to analyse such sparse determinants we introduce an indexing of the terms in the determinant expansion with each term being indexed by an oriented @xmath5-colouring of the underlying sparse graph satisfying a coloured outdegree property . </S>",
    "<S> this indexing is used to make explicit the effects of bar substitutions under joint splitting , and we expect this formalism to be useful more generally .    </S>",
    "<S> the periodic joint - splitting moves correspond to natural vertex - splitting moves on the quotient graph @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> such quotient graphs , which in general are multi - graphs with loop edges , are realisable on the topological torus in three dimensions , and joint - splitting derives from natural vertex - splitting moves on @xmath15 which respect the facial structure . </S>",
    "<S> the local planarity of the graphs @xmath16 and @xmath15 is captured by local face graphs and diagrams , and we refer to these diagrams to determine the possibilities for colouring extensions associated with each type of joint - splitting move .    </S>",
    "<S> it follows from our arguments that the `` hidden symmetry '' underlying the dimension @xmath7 phenomenon discovered in @xcite can be attributed to two factors , namely , ( i ) the fact that all entries of the matrix function for the base origami are antipalindromic , and ( ii ) the democratic way in which a periodic joint - splitting move changes the terms of the determinant expansion which sum to the origami polynomial .    </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a similar lower dimensional result for the mechanical mode spectrum of a properly generic triangulated @xmath7-periodic cylindrical surface . </S>",
    "<S> this covers the setting of @xmath7-periodic nanotubes @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we see that the univariate nanotube polynomial @xmath18 has the palindrome property and so generic points of the spectrum depend stably on perturbation of the ( periodic ) geometry of @xmath17 .    </S>",
    "<S> the author is grateful to bryan chen for introducing him to the palindrome conjecture . </S>"
