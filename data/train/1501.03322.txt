    "according with the world health organization ( who ) , the human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) and mycobacterium tuberculosis are the first and second cause of death from a single infectious agent , respectively @xcite .",
    "acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( aids ) is a disease of the human immune system caused by infection with hiv .",
    "hiv is transmitted primarily via unprotected sexual intercourse , contaminated blood transfusions , hypodermic needles , and from mother to child during pregnancy , delivery , or breastfeeding @xcite .",
    "there is no cure or vaccine to aids .",
    "however , antiretroviral ( art ) treatment improves health , prolongs life , and substantially reduces the risk of hiv transmission . in both high - income and low - income countries , the life expectancy of patients infected with hiv who have access to art is now measured in decades , and might approach that of uninfected populations in patients who receive an optimum treatment ( see @xcite and references cited therein ) .",
    "however , art treatment still presents substantial limitations : does not fully restore health ; treatment is associated with side effects ; the medications are expensive ; and is not curative .",
    "following unaids global report on aids epidemic 2013 @xcite , globally , an estimated 35.3 million people were living with hiv in 2012 .",
    "an increase from previous years , as more people are receiving art .",
    "there were approximately 2.3 million new hiv infections globally , showing a 33% decline in the number of new infections with respect to 2001 .",
    "at the same time , the number of aids deaths is also declining with around 1.6 million aids deaths in 2012 , down from about 2.3 million in 2005 .",
    "mycobacterium tuberculosis is the cause of most occurrences of tuberculosis ( tb ) and is usually acquired via airborne infection from someone who has active tb .",
    "it typically affects the lungs ( pulmonary tb ) but can affect other sites as well ( extrapulmonary tb ) . in 2012 ,",
    "approximately 8.6 million people fell ill with tb and 1.3 million people died from tb . nevertheless , tb death rate dropped 45 per cent between 1990 and 2012 , and 22 million lives were saved through use of strategies recommended by who @xcite .",
    "individuals infected with hiv are more likely to develop tb disease because of their immunodeficiency , and hiv infection is the most powerful risk factor for progression from tb infection to disease @xcite . in 2012 , 1.1 million of 8.6 million people who developed tb worldwide were hiv - positive .",
    "the number of people dying from hiv - associated to tb has been falling since 2003 .",
    "however , there were still 320 000 deaths from hiv - associated to tb in 2012 , and further efforts are needed to reduce this burden @xcite .",
    "art is a critical intervention for reducing the risk of tb morbidity and mortality among people living with hiv and , when combined with tb preventive therapy , it can have a significant impact on tb prevention @xcite .",
    "collaborative tb / hiv activities ( including hiv testing , art therapy and tb preventive measures ) are crucial for the reduction of tb - hiv coinfected individuals . who estimates that these collaborative activities prevented 1.3 million people from dying , from 2005 to 2012 .",
    "however , significant challenges remain : the reduction of tuberculosis related deaths among people living with hiv has slowed in recent years ; the art therapy is not being delivered to tb - hiv coinfected patients in the majority of the countries with the largest number of tb / hiv patients ; the pace of treatment scale - up for tb / hiv patients has slowed ; less than half of notified tb patients were tested for hiv in 2012 ; and only a small fraction of tb / hiv infected individuals received tb preventive therapy @xcite .    the study of the joint dynamics of tb and hiv present formidable mathematical challenges due to the fact that the models of transmission are quite distinct @xcite .",
    "some mathematical models have been proposed for tb - hiv coinfection ( see , e.g. , ) . in this paper",
    ", we propose a new population model for tb - hiv / aids coinfection transmission dynamics , where tb , hiv and tb - hiv infected individuals have access to respective disease treatment , and single hiv - infected and tb - hiv co - infected individuals under hiv and tb / hiv treatment , respectively , stay in a _ chronic _ stage of the hiv infection .",
    "optimal control is a branch of mathematics developed to find optimal ways to control a dynamic system @xcite .",
    "while the usefulness of optimal control theory in epidemiology is nowadays well recognized ( see , e.g. , ) , and has been applied to tb models ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and hiv models ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , to our knowledge optimal control have never been applied to a tb - hiv / aids coinfection model . in this paper , we apply optimal control theory to our tb - hiv / aids model and study optimal strategies for the minimization of the number of individuals with tb and aids active diseases , taking into account the costs associated to the proposed control measures .",
