    "in the study of fractal geometry a fundament problem is to find ways that measure the similarity or difference of fractal sets .",
    "the concept of dimension , whether it is the hausdorff dimension or the box counting dimension , is widely used for such a purpose : two sets having different dimensions are considered to be unalike . however for measuring differences dimension by itself is quite inadequate .",
    "two compact sets , even with the same dimension , may in fact be quite different in many ways .",
    "thus it is natural to seek a suitable quality that would allow us to tell whether two fractal sets are `` similar '' .",
    "generally , lipschitz equivalence is thought to be such a quality . in @xcite",
    "it was pointed out that while topology may be regarded as the study of equivalence classes of sets under homeomorphism , fractal geometry is sometimes thought of as the study of equivalence classes under bi - lipschitz mappings .",
    "more restrictive maps such as isometry tend to lead to rather uninteresting equivalent classes , while far less restrictive maps such as general continuous maps take us completely out of geometry into the realm of pure topology ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "bi - lipschitz maps offer a good balance , which lead to equivalent classes that are interesting and intriguing both geometrically and algebraically",
    ".    there has been notable progress on the study of bi - lipschitz equivalence classes , especially in recent years . yet",
    "much is still unknown , and this progress has led to more unanswered questions .",
    "the goal of this paper is to provide _ a comprehensive survey of the area_. it is our hope that the paper will provide a good overview of major results and techniques , and a friendly entry point for anyone who is interested in studying problems in this field .",
    "let @xmath0 be compact sets in @xmath1 .",
    "we say that @xmath2 and @xmath3 are _ lipschitz equivalent _ , denoted by @xmath4 , if there exists a bijection @xmath5 which is _ bi - lipschitz _ , i.e. there exists a constant @xmath6 such that @xmath7 for all @xmath8 .",
    "the general problem we consider is to find conditions under which the two sets @xmath2 and @xmath3 are lipschitz equivalent .",
    "recall that in general we characterize a self - similar set as the attractor of an _ iterated function system ( ifs)_. let @xmath9 be an ifs on @xmath1 where each @xmath10 is a contractive similarity with contraction ratio @xmath11 .",
    "the attractor of the ifs is the unique nonempty compact set @xmath3 satisfying @xmath12 , see @xcite .",
    "we say that the attractor @xmath3 is _ dust - like _ , or alternatively , the ifs @xmath13 satisfies the _ strong separation condition ( ssc ) _ , if the sets @xmath14 are disjoint .",
    "we remark that by definition , `` dust - like self - similar set '' is not the same as a `` totally disconnected self - similar set '' .",

    "now for any @xmath17 with @xmath18 , we will call @xmath19 a _ contraction vector _ , and use the notation @xmath20 to denote the set of all dust - like self - similar sets that are the attractor of some ifs with contraction ratios @xmath21 on @xmath1 .",

    "the translations in the similitudes in the ifs do not matter .",
    "in fact , all sets in @xmath22 are lipschitz equivalent to a symbolic space defined by @xmath24 . for any @xmath25 let @xmath26 denote the set of infinite words @xmath27 where each @xmath28 .",

    "the following is easy to prove :    [ prop-1.2 ] let @xmath19 be a contraction vector and @xmath42 .",

    "then for any @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are also lipschitz equivalent .",
    "proposition [ prop-1.1 ] gives a `` trivial condition '' for lipschitz equivalence .",

    "hence @xmath22 and @xmath70 have a common element @xmath2 , and they are equivalent .    the central question in the study of lipschitz equivalence of dust - like cantor sets is : under what conditions are two dust - like cantor sets lipschitz equivalent even if they have different contraction vectors ?",

    "this is a main focus of this survey .",
    "one of the very first and most fundamental results in this area is the following theorem , proved by falconer and marsh ( @xcite , theorem 3.3 ) , that establishes a connection to the algebraic properties of the contraction ratios :    [ theo : fama ] let @xmath22 and @xmath70 be lipschitz equivalent , where @xmath19 and @xmath73 are two contraction vectors .",

    "for example , let @xmath2 be the middle - third cantor set and @xmath3 be the dust - like cantor set given by the ifs @xmath86 where @xmath87 .",
    "then @xmath2 and @xmath3 have the same dimension .",
    "however , they are not lipschitz equivalent by theorem [ theo : fama ] .    along the direction of the theorem of falconer and marsh ,",
    "several other theorems have been established in recent years .",
    "these theorems further establish connections between lipschitz equivalence and algebraic properties of the contractions .",
    "we shall discuss them , along with several key techniques , later in this paper .",
    "another interesting question on lipschitz equivalence , in a different direction , considers the geometric structures of self - similar sets .",
    "perhaps the best known problem is the one proposed by david and semmes ( @xcite , problem  11.16 ) :    [ prob1 ] let @xmath88 where @xmath89 .",

    "we call @xmath90 the @xmath94-set and @xmath91 the @xmath95-set .",
    "the problem is generally known as the @xmath94-@xmath95 _ problem_. in this setting , @xmath90 is dust - like and @xmath91 has certain touching structure , see figure  [ figure : ds - set ] .",
    "in this problem , the contraction ratios are all identical so the difference lies entirely in the geometry of the two ifss .",
    "david and semmes conjectured that @xmath96 .",
    "however , by examining graph - directed structures of the attractors and introducing techniques to study lipschitz equivalence on these structures , rao , ruan and xi @xcite proved that in fact @xmath97 .",
    "naturally one may ask whether this result extends to the general setting , where we consider the equivalence of two ifss with the same contraction vector , but one is dust - like while the other has some touching structure .",
    "we shall discuss this problem in more details also later in the paper .",
    "in other direction , some recent works are done on the lipschitz equivalence of @xmath98-cantor sets , which are self - similar sets with overlap .",
    "we refer the readers to @xcite .",
    "in @xcite falconer and marsh had developed several important techniques to study the lipschitz equivalence of dust - like self - similar sets .",

    "we consider the lipschitz equivalence of two dust - like self - similar sets @xmath2 and @xmath3 with the following setup : we assume that @xmath105 is the attractor of @xmath106 and @xmath107 is the attractor of @xmath108 .",
    "we also assume in subsections  2.1 and 2.2 that @xmath109 and @xmath5 is a bi - lipschitz map .",
