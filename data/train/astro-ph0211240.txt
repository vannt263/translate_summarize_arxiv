    "magnetic fields play essential roles in various activities associated with accretion disks .",
    "the most important role is the angular momentum transport which enables the accretion of the disk material .",
    "since balbus & hawley ( 1991 ) pointed out the importance of the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) in accretion disks , the nonlinear growth of the instability has been studied by local three - dimensional magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations ( e.g. , hawley , gammie , & balbus 1995 ; matsumoto & tajima 1995 ; brandenburg et al .",
    "1995 ) and global mhd simulations ( e.g. , armitage 1998 ; matsumoto 1999 ; hawley 2000 ; machida , hayashi , & matsumoto 2000 ) .    when general relativistic effects are taken into account , accretion flow in the innermost region of black hole accretion disks changes from a circularly rotating flow to a radially infalling flow .",
    "there exist some radius below which almost all energy is advected inward into the black hole .",
    "the radial flow is transonic around the last stable orbit .",
    "steady models of black hole accretion disks including this transonic region were constructed under the prescription of @xmath0-viscosity for optically thick disks ( muchotrzeb & paczyski 1983 ; matsumoto et al .",
    "1984 ; abramowicz et al . 1988 ) and for optically thin disks ( e.g. , matsumoto , kato & fukue 1985 ; narayan , kato & honma 1997 ) .",
    "global three - dimensional mhd simulations of black hole accretion flows have been carried out by hawley ( 2000 ) , hawley ( 2001 ) , hawley & krolik ( 2001 ) , haley , balbus & stone ( 2001 ) , armitage , reynolds & chiang ( 2001 ) , reynolds & armitage ( 2001 ) , hawley & krolik ( 2002 ) , hawley & balbus ( 2002 ) , and krolik & hawley ( 2002 ) by using the pseudo - newtonian potential ( paczyski & witta 1980 ) . in black hole accretion flows , they reproduced radial flow profiles similar to those obtained by assuming the phenomenological @xmath0-viscosity .",
    "hawley & krolik ( 2001 ) showed that the ratio of stress to pressure which corresponds to the @xmath0 parameter in conventional disk models , exhibits both systematic gradients and large fluctuations ; it rises from @xmath1 in the disk midplane at large radius to @xmath2 near the midplane well inside the marginally stable radius .",
    "thus the efficiency of angular momentum extraction in the plunging region can be larger than that in transonic disk models ( see also reylonds & armitage 2001 ) .    another important mechanism in the innermost region of black hole accretion flow",
    "is the magnetic reconnection which can release magnetic energy even inside the marginally stable radius . in differentially rotating disks ,",
    "magnetic fields are stretched and amplified due to differential rotation .",
    "when uniform horizontal field threads an accretion disk , for example , magnetic fields twisted by differential rotation create current sheets which subject to magnetic reconnection .",
    "tajima & gilden ( 1987 ) carried out mhd simulations of the formation of current sheets and magnetic reconnection in accretion disks .",
    "they applied the mechanism to quasi - periodic oscillations of dwarf nova .",
    "sano & inutsuka ( 2001 ) carried out three - dimensional local mhd simulations of mri and showed quasi - periodic release of magnetic energy in accretion disks .    in our previous papers ( machida et al .",

    "the torus is deformed into a disk and matter accretes to the central part by losing the angular momentum . in the outer part of the torus , matter gets angular momentum and expands radially . the angular momentum transport is initially driven by the magneto - rotational instability .",

    "arcade type solar flares ( e.g. , tsuneta et al . 1992 ) which accompany loop eruption belong to the loop elongation type .",

    "magnetic reconnection taking place in this current layer released more energy than active region `` a '' because the current layer `` b '' has larger volume .",
    "although loop interaction releases less energy than arcade eruptions in solar corona , loop interaction can release more energy in accretion disks because rotational energy of the disk is converted to the magnetic energy by such interactions .",
    "figure 14 shows the time evolution of temperature .",
    "magnetic energy is deposited into the thermal energy and heats the plasma around the reconnection site .",

    "arrows indicate @xmath143 and @xmath151 .",
    "the largest flare occurs around this time interval .",
    "since we turn on anomalous resistivity only when @xmath152 , magnetic energy is released after the accretion rate decreases and the innermost region is rarefied .",
    "the joule dissipation rate @xmath153 tends to be zero when the matter density of the bss channel is high .",
    "this is the reason why @xmath154 has maximum after the peak of @xmath148 .",
    "magnetic energy decreases between @xmath79 and @xmath136 as expected from the magnetic reconnection model .",
    "only a small fraction ( @xmath155% ) of the released magnetic energy goes into the joule heating because @xmath156 in this simulation .",
    "the released magnetic energy is converted to the thermal energy by slow shock ( see figure 14 ) .",
    "the volume integrated current density correlates well with the mass accretion rate .",
    "this is because magnetic fields are stretched and amplified by mass accretion .",
    "in other words , parts of the gravitational energy of the accreting matter are stored in the current sheet and released by magnetic reconnection .",
    "next , let us compare the x - ray light curve obtained by numerical simulations with observations of x - ray shots .",
    "figure 16 shows the time variation of the x - ray luminosity computed by the optically thin bremsstrahlung luminosity @xmath157 ( dashed curve ) and joule heating rate @xmath158 ( solid curve ) where the integration is over the innermost region ( @xmath159 ) .",
    "we introduce cutoff function @xmath160 where @xmath161 when @xmath162 and otherwise @xmath163 .",
    "the vertical scale of figure 16 is arbitrary because @xmath164 and @xmath165 depend on the unit density @xmath166 and the electric resistivity @xmath167 ( see equation ( 5 ) ) . as the matter in dense spiral arms accrete to the innermost region , x - ray luminosity gradually increases and has a peak around @xmath168 .",
    "the time scale of the increase of x - ray luminosity is the accretion time scale of dense blobs and typically @xmath169 sec in our simulation ( see figure 7 ) .",
    "as the dense blob is swallowed into the black hole , x - ray luminosity decreases .",
    "subsequently , magnetic reconnection takes place in the rarefied region and releases the magnetic energy . the soft x - ray excess precedes the magnetic reconnection about @xmath170 .",
    "we have shown that in the innermost plunging region of black hole accretion disks , growth of non - axisymmetric mri creates bisymmetric spiral ( bss ) magnetic fields .",
    "mass accretion proceeds along these spiral channels . as a result",
    ", density distribution tends to show one armed spiral structure .",
    "a current sheet is created inside the bss channel because the magnetic field changes its direction inside the channel .",
    "the current sheet is built up by converting the gravitational energy of the accreting gas into magnetic energy .",
    "in other words , magnetic energy is accumulated by mass accretion . when the bss channel is rarefied after dense blobs infall , magnetic reconnection takes place and converts the magnetic energy into heats .",
    "this mechanism is analogous to the accumulation of magnetic energy by mass motion preceding solar flares and protostellar flares ( e.g. , hayashi et al . 1996 ) .",
    "magnetic reconnection can also take place by interaction of two long current sheets .",
    "these x - ray flares in the plunging region can be the origin of large amplitude x - ray time variabilities characteristic of black hole candidates .",
    "let us compare our numerical results with x - ray observations of cyg x-1 ( negoro et al .",
    "1995 ) . in x - ray",
    "hard states , x - ray flux from cyg x-1 shows largest shots whose interval is typically several seconds ( negoro & mineshige 2002 ) . in our simulation ,",
    "the largest shot occurred at @xmath171 sec after the initial torus is set up at @xmath172 .",
    "the magnetic reconnection produces outgoing waves and cusp - shaped current sheets .",
    "we have shown that the mass accretion from the circularly rotating dense torus is not time steady but intermittent .",
    "the interval of mass feeding from the torus is the rotation period of the torus ( figure 7a ) . in our simulation",
    ", this time scale corresponds to @xmath173 sec .",
    "if the torus locates at @xmath174 , this interval @xmath175 sec approaches the interval of observed shots if the mass of the black hole is @xmath176 .",
    "once dense blobs accrete to the innermost region , the profile of the shot is essentially determined by the local processes in the innermost region .",
    "thus the profile of one shot may not depend on the location of the center of the torus .",
    "however , the interval of the shot depends on @xmath44 .",
    "smaller x - ray shots and fluctuations can be created by magnetic reconnections ubiquitous in accretion disks",
    ". observations of cyg x-1 indicate that the averaged shot profile is time symmetric ( negoro et al .",
    "2001 ) and x - rays become hard at the peak of the shot .",
    "figure 17 schematically shows the mechanism of x - ray shots .",
    "the upper left panel shows the accretion stage when dense blobs fall into the innermost region . as the density in the innermost region increases , the soft x - ray luminosity increases .",
    "current sheets are formed inside the bss channel and magnetic energy is accumulated . after the blobs are swallowed into the black hole , the current sheet in the bss channel",
    "is rarefied .",
    "the soft x - ray luminosity begins to decrease because x - ray emitting gas is depleted .",
    "largest magnetic reconnection takes place in the rarefied current sheet by loop elongation or by loop interaction .",
    "since the released magnetic energy is converted to heat , x - ray luminosity will suddenly increase and decays exponentially . in order to compute the light curve after magnetic reconnection",
    ", we will have to include the effects of heat conduction along the magnetic loop which may evaporate the disk material ( see the numerical simulation of solar flares by yokoyama & shibata 2001 ) .",
    "we would like to report the results of such simulations in future .",
    "the bss magnetic fields in the innermost region of black hole accretion disks contribute to the angular momentum transport of the disk material . in this region ,",
    "angular momentum transport due to this ordered spiral magnetic fields is more efficient than the angular momentum transport by turbulent magnetic fields .",
    "the dynamical effects of magnetic fields in the plunging region of black hole accretion flows have been investigated analytically by krolik ( 1999 ) , gammie ( 1999 ) , agol & krolik ( 1998 , 2000 ) and simulated by hawley & krolik ( 2001 , 2002 ) and krolik & hawley ( 2002 ) .",
    "our numerical results support their conclusion that the ratio of stress to pressure ( @xmath0 ) has systematic gradient with radius and has larger values well inside the plunging region .    in the innermost region of the disk ,",
    "the accretion flow is dominated by radial advection .",
    "the radial structure of the innermost region ( @xmath177 ) of accretion flow obtained by three - dimensional mhd simulations approaches the global transonic solution of optically thin disks with the viscous parameter @xmath178 ( e.g. , narayan et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the direct numerical simulations such as the one we presented in this paper have the potential to do much more than seek agreement with @xmath0-models .",
    "they can predict the time varitation of black hole accretion flows without assuming the phenomenological @xmath0-parameter . in order to confirm the applicability of numerically obtained accretion flows to black hole candidates , it is essential to compute the x - ray spectrum from numerical results and compare them with observations .",
    "we would like to report the results of such analysis in subsequent papers .",

    "<S> since the accreting matter carries in magnetic fields which subsequently are stretched and amplified due to differential rotation , current density increases inside the channel . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic reconnection taking place in the current sheet produces slow mode shock waves which propagate away from the reconnection site . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic energy release in the innermost plunging region can be the origin of x - ray shots observed in black hole candidates . </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulations reproduced soft x - ray excess preceding the peak of the shots , x - ray hardening at the peak of the shot , and hard x - ray time lags . </S>"
