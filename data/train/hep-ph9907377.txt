    "in the phenomenology of supersymmetric ( susy ) particles the neutralinos @xmath4 play a special rle . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )",
    "one has four neutralinos @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "if r - parity is conserved @xmath6 is considered to be the lightest stable susy particle ( lsp ) . in @xmath7 or @xmath8 ( @xmath9 )",
    "collisions neutralinos @xmath4 as well as charginos @xmath10 , @xmath11 , are produced directly or in cascade decays of heavier susy particles .",
    "therefore , a precise and complete theoretical knowledge of the decay properties of neutralinos and charginos is mandatory for the understanding of all aspects of susy phenomenology .",
    "neutralino decays have been extensively studied in the literature @xcite . in the following we",
    "reexamine the decays of @xmath12 .",
    "if two - body decays like @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 ( with @xmath16 being a slepton , sneutrino or squark ) are kinematically not possible , the three - body decays @xmath17 and @xmath18 will dominate . here",
    "@xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) denote a standard model ( sm ) fermion .",
    "the decay ( [ eq : chi0tochi0 ] ) proceeds at tree level via @xmath21 , @xmath16 and higgs boson exchange ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 in the mssm ) .",
    "usually , the higgs boson exchange is assumed to be small or even negligible , at least for small or moderate @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , @xmath27 being the vacuum expectation values of the neutral higgs fields in the mssm . in this note",
    "we will point out that higgs exchange can be important in a certain domain of the susy parameters for @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "this is the case if @xmath6 and @xmath12 are gaugino - like ( @xmath28 ) and the sfermions are relatively heavy ( @xmath29  gev ) . in this case",
    "the @xmath21 contribution will be suppressed because the @xmath21 couples only to the higgsino components of @xmath30 .",
    "the sfermion exchange contribution will also be suppressed due to the heavy sfermion mass .",
    "then the higgs boson exchange becomes important in the decays @xmath1 and @xmath2 due to the corresponding yukawa couplings which are proportional to @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "this enlarges the branching ratios for these decays , even for small @xmath25 , and reduces the branching ratios for final states containing leptons and quarks of the first and second generation . for large @xmath25",
    "this lepton non - universality effect was already discussed in @xcite .    moreover , the higgs exchange contribution depends on the parameters of the higgs sector . in the mssm",
    "the @xmath22-@xmath33-@xmath34 coupling depends on the higgs mixing angle @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "we will show that higgs boson exchange plays a rle at small @xmath25 for @xmath3  gev . for larger values of @xmath36 @xmath37",
    "becomes smaller and , therefore the higgs boson exchange contribution becomes less important .",
    "the higgs boson exchange has , of course , implications for the neutralino search at present and future colliders .",
    "for instance , the neutralino search at lep @xcite and the trilepton signal at tevatron due to @xmath38 @xcite would be affected by the higgs boson contributions in the decays .",

    "then @xmath12 decays mainly into @xmath40 because @xmath41 .",

    "the branching ratio for @xmath1 has maxima near @xmath90  gev .",

    "[ fig : brtbn ] shows the @xmath25 dependence of @xmath100 for @xmath101  gev .",

    "this dependence is rather weak except for @xmath119 where @xmath120 .",
    "in this paper we have shown that the higgs boson exchange contributions to three - body decay modes of the second lightest neutralino can be very important even if @xmath0 is small .",
    "this is valid for scenarios where the sfermions are heavy ( @xmath121 ) and @xmath36 is not too heavy ( @xmath3  gev ) .",
