    "reconciliation of globular cluster ages and the hubble time is a primary issue of contemporary observational astronomy .",
    "heretofore , the single largest uncertainty in the calculation of globular cluster ages from color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) data has been the distance error @xcite , followed by the stellar model uncertainties associated with the choice of the mixing length parameter .",
    "the hopes that hipparcos @xcite would resolve the distance issue have not been fulfilled .",
    "for example , recent determinations of the distance modulus to 47 tuc based on hipparcos subdwarfs gave a value of 13.57 @xcite , while the value based on hipparcos red clump giants is 13.32 @xcite .",
    "the most likely reason for the discrepancy is the comparison of nearby stars with distant stars , with imperfect understanding of the population effects .",
    "we avoid these difficulties by measurements of stellar masses and radii in the eclipsing binary oglegc17 in the globular cluster @xmath0 cen .",
    "detached eclipsing double line spectroscopic binaries offer the opportunity to calculate age directly from age - turnoff mass predictions from stellar evolution models .",
    "distance follows from a geometrical calculation that employs the barnes - evans relation @xcite between color and surface brightness .",
    "the method is very simple , and is well described by @xcite , who has used the method to measure the distances to a number of well studied systems @xcite .",
    "his distance determinations agree well with the recent trigonometric parallaxes obtained by hipparcos @xcite .",
    "@xcite was fully aware of the equivalent method to determine the surface brightness of the components of algol , for which a trigonometric parallax had just been measured . a complete list of historical references can be found in @xcite .",
    "there has been steady progress in the last few years in the empirical calibration of the barnes - evans relation with the direct determinations of angular diameters of many stars obtained with optical interferometers @xcite , and there are excellent prospects of further improvement @xcite . until recently the only missing elements have been the detached eclipsing binaries in globular clusters .",
    "recent massive photometric searches for the rare photometric signatures of gravitational microlensing have led to the discovery of over @xmath7 new variable stars .",
    "in particular , the first detached eclipsing binary near a main sequence turnoff was found in the globular cluster @xmath0 cen as a ` secondary ' project of ogle @xcite . by now several more such systems have been found in several other globular clusters by our group .",
    "demonstrations of the practical power of using eclipsing binaries for distance determinations to the large magellanic cloud have been recently presented by @xcite ( hv 5936 ) , @xcite ( hv 2274 ) and @xcite ( hv 982 ) .",
    "detached binaries can also free us from problems associated with the mixing length parameter , because binaries can yield the mass - luminosity relation , and this is not affected by the mixing length parameter ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "also , the helium abundance can be deduced if the two components are sufficiently different in mass .",
    "this is all possible because detached components are just two single stars , never affected by the complications of mass exchange , and their internal structure is not disturbed by the fact that they orbit each other .",
    "a practical demonstration that all stellar parameters can be determined with a high accuracy , given accurate photometry and spectroscopy , is provided by the catalog of well studied detached eclipsing binaries covering the spectral range from o to m @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present observations of the detached eclipsing binary oglegc17 in the globular cluster @xmath0 centauri @xcite .",
    "this star has a period of 2.467 days .",
    "eclipse depths are @xmath8v = 0.30 and @xmath8v = 0.26 for the primary and secondary eclipses , respectively . with an observed color of @xmath6 = 0.64 and an observed magnitude of @xmath9 = 17.16 ( out of eclipse ) , this system lies slightly above the top of the main sequence in the cluster color - magnitude diagram , consistent with the individual members of the binary being stars at or near the cluster turnoff . these parameters along with the shape of the light curve suggest that the system is completely detached , making it ideal to study . these observations are used to derive preliminary estimates of the masses of the constituent stars and the distance and age of the cluster .    in the next section we present a description of the observations and the reduction analysis . following that we derive the age and distance of the cluster .",
    "@xmath10 , @xmath9 and @xmath11 light curves were obtained with the @xmath12 pixel tek#5 ccd camera on the du pont 2.5-m telescope at las campanas observatory during the period april 21 , 1995 through june 4 , 1995 .",
    "the field of view was @xmath13 arcmin with scale of 0.26 arcsec / pixel .",
    "the individual frames were processed with iraf software , and the photometry was measured with dophot @xcite . several standard fields from @xcite were observed on 4 nights during the 1995 run .",
    "these observations were used to establish a transformation between the instrumental @xmath14 and the standard @xmath15 system .",
    "unfortunately , the only night on which we observed landolt standards along with oglegc17 turned out to be non - photometric .",
    "the zero points of our photometry of oglegc17 were established based on data collected during the 1997 observing season .",

    "the totality of the primary eclipse allows a straightforward determination of the magnitudes and colors of both components of the binary . assuming that to first order effects due to the ellipsoidality of the components and to the reflection of light are negligible",
    "one may adopt the magnitudes and colors observed at phase 0.0 ( the eclipse of the secondary component ) as corresponding to the larger component of the system .",

    "in addition , uncertainties in the adopted values of the effective temperatures of the components do not noticeably influence the results of our analysis .",
    "these temperatures were estimated using the empirical calibration @xmath49})$ ] published by sekiguchi & fukugita ( 2000 ) .",

    "we assumed a detached configuration for oglegc17 and analysed the light curve by running the wd code in both modes 0 and 2 .",

    "the adjustable parameters are the inclination @xmath41 , the dimension - less potentials @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and the relative luminosities @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the three light curves were analysed simultaneously so the total number of adjustable parameters was equal to nine . in mode 2 the luminosities are coupled to the temperatures .",
    "for that mode the adjustable parameters are @xmath41 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , the temperature of the secondary component @xmath56 , and the luminosity @xmath54 ( a total of 7 free parameters ) . for both modes",
    "stable solutions were derived and the resulting parameters and formal errors are listed in table 5 .",
    "the parameters obtained from both solutions are consistent with each other to within the formal uncertainties .",
    "the solution corresponding to mode 2 shows slightly smaller errors for most parameters and given that this solution has fewer free parameters we adopt it in the following discussion . in fig .",
    "5 we show the residuals of the fit along with the synthetic light curve overlaid on the observed light curves . in table 6",
    "we list some of the absolute parameters of the system obtained by combining data from tables 4 and 5 .    the results of our analysis show that oglegc17 is a well - detached system .",

    "the secondary component is almost spherical with @xmath59 .",
    "as noted above , the primary is slightly evolved , with a larger total luminosity and lower surface brightness than the secondary .",
    "the fact that the primary component of oglegc17 has already left the cluster turnoff should allow a precise determination of its age by use of age - luminosity and age - turnoff mass relations derived from models of stellar structure and evolution .",
    "we adopt the models of @xcite in the following discussion .",
    "the two main sources of uncertainty in our determination of the age of oglegc17 are the relatively large errors in the estimated masses of both components and the metallicity of this particular system .",
    "it has been known for many years that unlike other globular clusters in our galaxy @xmath0  cen contains stars with a range of metallicities ( norris & bessell 1975 ) .",
    "suntzeff & kraft ( 1996 ) used a sample of 379 stars ( 234 and 145 from the lower and upper giant branch , respectively ) with spectroscopically derived [ fe / h ] to study the metallicity distribution in the cluster .",
    "they found that all but a few stars have [ fe / h ] ranging from @xmath60 to @xmath61 throughout . ] .",
    "the observed distribution rises rapidly at @xmath62}=-1.85 $ ] with a median value @xmath62}=-1.7 $ ] .",
    "in addition , 78% of their sample has @xmath63}<-1.4 $ ] . a recent study by majewski et al .",
    "( 2000 ) shows quite convincingly that the metallicity distribution of @xmath0  cen giants terminates at the metal - rich end at @xmath64\\approx -1.15 $ ] . the apparent discrepancy with earlier studies",
    "is explained by more a careful elimination of field interlopers in the majewski et al .",
    "study .    unfortunately",
    ", our spectra have very low @xmath65 ratio and can not be used for a direct determination of the system metallicity .",
    "however , we can use the location of the components of oglegc17 on the cluster cmd ( see fig .",
    "3 ) to estimate metallicity .",
    "several authors have suggested that @xmath0  cen harbors a few sub - populations of stars , not only of different metallicities but also of different ages ( lee at al .",
    "1999 ; hughes & wallerstein 2000 ; see also references therein ) .",
    "it has been estimated that ages of the cluster stars cover a range of about 3  gyr with the more metal rich stars being younger .",
    "if this is true then the position of the primary component in the cluster cmd is not very useful as effects of age and metallicity can not be easily deconvolved at the top of the main - sequence - for a fixed age stars with higher metallicity are fainter , but for fixed [ fe / h ] younger stars are brighter . since the primary component is on the bright side of the `` clump '' of stars leaving the main - sequence it can be either old and metal poor , or young and metal rich .",
    "the secondary component of the binary is located on the blue edge of the upper main - sequence , just below the turn - off .",
    "hence its metallicity places it among the bulk of @xmath0  cen stars with @xmath62}\\approx -1.7 $ ] .    in the following discussion",
    "we will derive results for two assumed values of metallicity : @xmath62}=-1.74 $ ] and @xmath62}=-1.33 $ ] .",
    "the lower value is marginally smaller than the median value for the bulk of the cluster giants ( suntzeff & kraft 1996 ) and the higher one marks the lower end of the observed metallicity distribution .",
    "in addition , modern evolutionary tracks suitable for our analysis are available in the literature for these two values of [ fe / h ] ( see below ) .",
    "the most straightforward way to estimate the age of the cluster is to use the fact that the mass of the primary star in oglegc17 differs negligibly from the turnoff mass of @xmath0 cen .",
    "the time it takes a main sequence star to exhaust its core hydrogen is a monotonic function of mass therefore our estimate of the mass of the primary star derived from spectroscopic and photometric data can be used to directly measure the age of the cluster .",
    "figure 6 shows age - turnoff mass relations from @xcite for metallicities z = 0.0004 and z = 0.001 , corresponding to @xmath62}=-1.74 $ ] and @xmath51}=-1.33 $ ] , respectively , assuming @xmath66 - 1.699}$ ] @xcite .",
    "these values bracket the likely value for the metallicity of oglegc17 .",
    "the solid line and dotted lines represent the mass of the primary star and one sigma errors , @xmath67 .",
    "the resulting ranges in the age of the primary of oglegc17 are @xmath68  gyr for z = 0.0004 , and @xmath69  gyr for z = 0.001 .",
    "a formal error in the estimated age of @xmath171 gyr could be obtained by reducing the uncertainties in the masses to @xmath70 .",
    "the corresponding uncertainty in the @xmath71 velocities is @xmath171 km / s .",
    "we can also estimate the age of the cluster by using age versus luminosity relations .",
    "an advantage of this approach is that the parameters of the secondary component provide an independent constraint on the age of the binary and therefore can be used for testing and/or improving the result derived from analysis of the primary component alone . to minimize the uncertainties involved in a comparison of observed quantities with calibrations provided by models we use the age versus bolometric luminosity relation @xcite .",
    "bolometric luminosities from models are unaffected by uncertainties associated with model isochrones relating @xmath72 and @xmath73 to color index and absolute magnitude in a selected band .",

    "in addition , the systematic error associated with the uncertain metallicity of this system can be addressed by high signal - to - noise echelle observations at quadrature , where the relative velocities of the two components are large enough to allow an metallicity estimate for each of the components .",
    "the limits on the age of oglegc17 listed above were derived using stellar tracks taken from models published by @xcite .",
    "one may wonder to what extend our results depend on the selection of a particular set of stellar models .",
    "a detailed comparison of different sets of models is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , we performed a limited test by comparing age - luminosity relations from girardi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) with relations constructed from tabular data given by weiss & schlattl ( 2000 ) .",
    "analytical expressions given by weiss & schlattl allow one to construct age - luminosity relations for a large range of masses and chemical composition defined by @xmath116 .",
    "hence , given masses and luminosities for the components of a given binary , one may derive not only the age but also the helium content @xmath87 .",
    "age - luminosity relations were extracted from two sets of models for @xmath117=[0.0004,0.23]$ ] and for @xmath117=[0.001,023]$ ] and for masses @xmath118 to @xmath119 . a comparison of these two sets of models is presented in figure 8 which shows differential residuals @xmath120 versus luminosity for models with @xmath117=[0.0004,0.23]$ ] and for two values of the mass .",
    "we conclude that relations based on these two recent sets of models are in very good agreement with each other for the considered range of parameters .",
    "oglegc17 offers the opportunity for determining the distance to a globular cluster in a way independent of other measurement techniques .",
    "here we present two estimates , one based on the bolometric luminosities of the components of the binary , and the second based on relations between the surface brightness and infrared colors .",
    "we may use the bolometric luminosities listed in table 7 to calculate the absolute visual magnitudes @xmath121 of both components of the binary .",
    "bolometric corrections were obtained by interpolating tabular data given in @xcite for unreddened color indices @xmath122 and @xmath123 and gravities @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "we obtained bolometric corrections @xmath126 and @xmath127 for @xmath62}=-1.74]$ ] and @xmath128 and @xmath129 for @xmath62}=-1.33 $ ] .",
    "our formal uncertainties of @xmath130 of 0.03 transform into formal errors for bolometric corrections of about 0.01 . adopting @xmath131 ( eg .",
    "salaris & weiss 1988 ) and using the bolometric luminosities from table 7 we arrive at the absolute visual magnitudes given in table 8 .",
    "we then use the apparent @xmath9 magnitudes of both components to calculate the distance moduli and these are also given in table 8 .",
    "values of @xmath132 derived for the primary and the secondary component are consistent with each other . for the @xmath133 effective temperature calibration and @xmath62}=-1.74 $ ] we obtain an average value @xmath134 while for @xmath51}=-1.33 $ ] we have @xmath135 . for the @xmath136 effective temperature calibration and @xmath62}=-1.74",
    "$ ] we obtain an average value of @xmath137 and for @xmath62}=-1.33 $ ] we obtain @xmath137 .    these values are broadly consistent with @xmath138 adopted by harris ( 1996 ) for @xmath0 cen .",
    "we estimate the distance to oglegc17 by use of empirically calibrated relations between surface brightness and infrared color .",
    "di benedetto ( 1998 ) presented a calibration of @xmath139 vs @xmath136 for a sample of nearby , population i stars with luminosity classes iii , iv , and v. we have extended his calibration to @xmath140 , and @xmath141 for the same set of stars .",
    "figure 9 presents these photometric data , together with quadratic least - squares fits .",
    "values for @xmath142 and for @xmath84 were taken from di benedetto ( 1998 ) , and the rest of the photometric data were taken from archival tables accessed at the centre de donnes astronomiques de strasbourg .",
    "note that the calibrating photometry is in the johnson system .",
    "the terms for the quadratic fits are presented in table 9 together with the rms values of the fits ( some obviously discrepant points in figure 9 were not included in these fits ) .",
    "figure 9 also shows reddening vectors for a reddening of @xmath143 .",
    "the vectors are essentially parallel to the relations , indicating that modest errors in the reddening do not impact the estimates of the physical distance to the binary ( note , however , that errors in the reddening do directly affect the final estimates of the distance modulus @xmath144 ) . given the relative rms values of the fits , and the steepness of the @xmath145 relation , we estimate the distance to oglegc17 using only our @xmath146 , and @xmath33-band data .",
    "the stars used in the surface brightness calibration are of necessity in the solar neighbourhood , and therefore most likely are population i stars . to see how the surface brightness versus color calibration depends on metallicity we have used synthetic color - temperature relations from @xcite .",
    "figure 10 presents @xmath142 - color relations extracted from table 5 in @xcite for [ fe / h ] = 0.0 and [ fe / h ] = -2.0 .",
    "as also found by di benedetto ( 1998 ) , these relations show little sensitivity to metallicity , the correction amounting to approximately + 0.04 in @xmath142 for the @xmath30 filter and + 0.02 in @xmath142 for the @xmath31 and @xmath33 filters .",
    "table 2 presents mean magnitudes for @xmath147 and @xmath33-band observations of oglegc17 taken out of eclipse .",
    "assuming @xmath148 for oglegc17 at quadrature , and assuming a reddening of @xmath149 0.13 and a reddening law from @xcite we calculate the mean colors for the system as a whole listed in column 2 of table 10 .",
    "the wd solution for the light curve ( see figure 5 ) indicates that the ellipticity of the primary and , to a lesser extent , reflection effects in the binary , produce a one percent modulation of the @xmath9-band light out of eclipse .",
    "we have ignored these effects in calculating mean colors . in order to calculate the colors of the individual components we need to know the relative luminosities of the primary and secondary .",
    "these ratios require light curves through the eclipses in the infrared bands , data which we do not have .",
    "the wd code used to estimate these ratios by extrapolating the @xmath150 , and @xmath11-band solutions to @xmath146 , and @xmath33 ( mode 2 , see table 5 ) .",
    "these values are @xmath151 , and @xmath152 with estimated errors of @xmath153 .",
    "the unreddened colors of the individual components of the binary are listed in columns 3 and 4 of table 10 .",
    "the surface brightness @xmath154 of a star is defined as : @xmath155 where @xmath156 is the un - reddened apparent magnitude of a star of angular diameter @xmath157 .",
    "the zero - point is set such that @xmath158 for @xmath159 mas . from di benedetto , equation 4",
    ", we have @xmath160 and from @xcite , equation 4 , we have @xmath161 also @xmath162    we use colors from table 10 ( transformed to the johnson system using relations in @xcite and @xcite ) together with the relations in table 9 to calculate the surface brightnesses of the components of the binary ; these are listed in columns 2 and 3 in table 11 .",
    "the above equations are then used to calculate the distances ( columns 4 and 5 in table 11 ) and the distance moduli ( columns 6 and 7 in table 11 ) .",
    "we adopt a distance which is the average of the values derived for the @xmath142 estimates from @xmath163 , @xmath141 , and @xmath102 for the primary and secondary , all values weighted equally .",
    "the final values are @xmath164 pc and @xmath165 . to estimate the errors in these values we determined the sensitivity of the answers to one sigma variations in the input observations .",
    "the physical distance changes 4.0 per cent for a one sigma change in @xmath166 and @xmath40 , 2.9 per cent for @xmath167 and @xmath168 , 2.2 per cent for @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath33 photometry , 0.8 per cent for @xmath9 photometry , and 0.7 per cent for @xmath76 .",
    "the result is insensitive ( 0.3 per cent change ) to variations in @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 , and @xmath172 .",
    "the quadrature sum of these percentage errors totals 5.5 per cent , and our final estimate of the distance to @xmath0 centauri is @xmath3 pc .",
    "the distance modulus is @xmath4 .",
    "note that the error in the reddening is much more important in determining the distance modulus .",
    "it is interesting to note that the values for the distance modulus derived from our @xmath33-band observations ( through bolometric luminosities using effective temperatures calibrated with @xmath102 colors and through surface brightnesses estimated from @xmath163 , @xmath141 , and @xmath102 colors ) are very similar and differ at the level of 0.20 magnitudes from the other estimates of the distance modulus of @xmath0 cen .",
    "the error in the estimation of the physical distance is dominated by the accuracy of the velocity curve and the accuracy of the photometric solution for the radii .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , it should be possible to lower the errors in the radial velocity curve by at least a factor of five by use of improved echelle observations of oglegc17 .",
    "in addition , detailed visual and infrared observations of the light curves will improve the photometric solution for relative radii and luminosities .",
    "given that the primary eclipse is total and that the binary is detached , a precision of the order of 0.1% is attainable for these relative parameters .",
    "in addition , we will be able to replace the estimates of the effective temperatures based on @xmath133 with superior estimates based on infrared colors , significantly reducing errors arising from uncertain metallicity of oglegc17 .",
    "we have presented photometric and spectroscopic observations of the detached , eclipsing binary oglegc17 in the globular cluster @xmath0 cen .",
    "we have used these data to estimate the age of this system to be @xmath173  gyr from age - turnoff mass relations and @xmath109  gyr from age - luminosity relations .",
    "we have used an empirical calibration of surface brightness with infrared color to estimate a distance of @xmath3 pc to the cluster , a distance modulus of @xmath174 .",
    "this is in disagreement with an estimate of @xmath175 based on the measured bolometric luminosities of the components of the binary .",
    "these estimates can be improved in a straightforward way by further observations , in particular better determinations of the @xmath176 velocities and of the visual and infrared eclipse light profiles .",
    "formal errors in the age of @xmath177  gyr are achievable by reducing the errors in the velocity curves to @xmath171  km / s .",
