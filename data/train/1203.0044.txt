    "recently , ad hoc networks have attracted extensive research interest within computer communication and engineering communities .",
    "connectivity of the underlying network is the foundation for its functions , as is indicated in @xcite .",
    "a number of mathematically rigorous results on the asymptotic critical transmission radius and asymptotic critical neighbors for the connectivity of network in one - dimensional areas have been obtained , see e.g. @xcite . the random version of one - dimensional network is also called the random interval graph , which has been studied in depth in @xcite .",
    "more recently , a concept of access points are introduced in @xcite . given @xmath0 ,",
    "let @xmath1 be @xmath2 independent uniformly distributed random variables on the interval @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "denote by @xmath4 the graph with vertex set @xmath5 and with an edge @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , if @xmath8 .",
    "some access points @xmath9 can exist in @xmath4 .",
    "an interesting concept of accessible connectivity has also been introduced , which is different from the ordinary connectivity with possible fixed nodes .",
    "multiple components issues are considered in @xcite ( @xmath10 theorem 2.2 below ) .    in this paper",
    "we will perform numerical study on the connectivity of one - dimensional ad hoc networks with a fixed point .",
    "our work can be viewed as an independent test of the theoretical results obtained in prior work .",
    "we need some further definitions here .",
    "we denote the graph by @xmath11 if there exists a fixed node at the point @xmath12 $ ] . in particular , when @xmath13 , the graph is @xmath14 .",
    "we use @xmath15 to denote the probability that the above graph model is composed of exactly @xmath16 components .",
    "the following results are known .          to test the results in theorem 2.2",
    ", we have performed extensive simulations on graph @xmath4 with a fixed node at @xmath23 . for different values of @xmath2 and @xmath16 , we plot the probability @xmath24 as a function of @xmath25 , see fig.1 fig .",
    "a future research problem would be to derive exact formula on two dimensional ad hoc networks .",
