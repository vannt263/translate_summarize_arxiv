    "markov ( and an improvement due to n. weinberg ) @xcite , @xcite , @xcite there is a bijection ( induced by ` closing ' the braid ) between isotopy classes of oriented links and equivalence classes of braids , the equivalence being generated by braid isotopy and by two moves between braids : _ markov conjugation _ ( conjugating by a crossing ) and the _ markov move _ or _ @xmath13move _ ( adding an extra crossing at a rightmost point ) .",
    "in @xcite we introduced a new type of braid move , the _ @xmath11move _",
    "( adding an in - box crossing ; view figure 5 for abstract illustrations ) , and we showed that the equivalence relation generated by @xmath11moves and braid isotopy gives the same bijection . consequently ,",
    "markov conjugation and markov moves can be produced by @xmath11moves ( see figures 12 , 13 ) .",
    "the markov theorem can be regarded as a _",
    "geometrical _ result ( by thinking of braids as geometrical objects ) or as an _",
    "algebraic _ result ( by thinking of braids as elements of the classical braid group @xmath0 ) . in the latter case",
    "the two moves of the markov equivalence have the two well - known algebraic formulations .",
    "similarly , the @xmath11moves have analogous algebraic formulations ( cf .",
    "@xcite ; remark 2.2 ) .",
    "let now @xmath14 be the complement of a link . by `",
    "link complements ' we mean complements of both knots and links and by ` links ' we always mean knots and links .",
    "all links are considered oriented and piecewise linear ( pl ) , but will be mostly illustrated smooth for convenience . by the alexander theorem ,",
    "this link is isotopic to the closure @xmath15 of a braid  @xmath16 .",
    "so , we can write @xmath17 and @xmath14 can be represented in @xmath12 by @xmath15 .",
    "further , let @xmath14 be a closed , connected , oriented @xmath7manifold ( we shall simply write  closed @xmath7manifold \" ) . by classic results of lickorish and wallace @xcite , @xcite @xmath14 can be obtained from @xmath12 by surgery along a framed link with integral framings . without loss of generality",
    "the surgery link can be assumed to be the closure @xmath15 of a _ surgery braid _ @xmath16 .",
    "( note that the framing of @xmath15 induces a framing on the surgery braid @xmath16 . )",
    "so , we can write @xmath18 and @xmath14 can be represented in @xmath12 by @xmath15 .",
    "moreover , by the proof in @xcite , all components of the surgery link can be assumed unknotted and , as can be easily seen , they can be isotoped to the closure of a pure braid .",
    "thus , _ for closed @xmath7manifolds we may assume @xmath16 to be a pure braid .",
    "_    let now @xmath11 be an oriented link in @xmath17 or @xmath19 .",
    "fixing @xmath15 pointwise we may represent @xmath11 in @xmath12 unambiguously by the _",
    "mixed link _ @xmath20 , which consists of the fixed part @xmath15 and the ` moving ' part @xmath11 that links with @xmath15 ( see figure 1 for an example ) .",
    "mixed link diagram _ is a diagram @xmath21 of @xmath20 on the plane of @xmath15 .",
    "this plane is equipped with the top - to - bottom direction of @xmath16 . by the alexander theorem and as explained in @xcite ( cf .",
    "theorem 5.3 ) , a diagram @xmath22 of @xmath20 may be turned into a _ mixed braid _",
    "@xmath23 with isotopic closure .",
    "( the closure of a braid is obtained by joining each pair of corresponding endpoints by a simple arc . )",
    "this is a braid in @xmath12 with two different sets of strands , abstractly represented by a braid box with two differently coloured sets of strands .",
    "the point here is that one of the two sets comprises the _ fixed subbraid @xmath16 _ and not any other markov equivalent one .",
    "the other set of strands representing the link in the manifold @xmath14 is called the _ moving subbraid_.",
    "see figure 1 for an example .",
    "so , @xmath14 may be represented in @xmath12 by the open braid @xmath16 .",
    "consider now an isotopy of @xmath11 in @xmath14 .",
    "it follows from standard results of pl topology that @xmath24 and @xmath25 are two instances of an isotopy in @xmath26 if and only if the corresponding mixed links @xmath27 and @xmath28 are isotopic in @xmath12 by an ambient isotopy which keeps @xmath15 pointwise fixed .",
    "see @xcite .",
    "in terms of diagrams , the mixed link isotopy will not involve reidemeister moves of the fixed part .",
    "the first stage of surgery along a framed link @xmath15 is to pass from @xmath12 to the link complement @xmath26 .",
    "thus , an isotopy of @xmath11 in @xmath19 can be viewed as an isotopy in @xmath26 , but with the extra freedom for @xmath11 to slide across the disc that the parallel curve of a framed component of @xmath29 bounds in @xmath19 .",
    "this isotopy move is similar to the second move of the kirby calculus .",
    "as noted in @xcite , the first part of the move is just isotopy in @xmath30 , so we only need to consider the essential part , where a little band of @xmath11 very close to the surgery component slides over the component , according to the framing and orientation conventions .",
    "we shall call this move a _ band move_. a band move takes place in an arbitrarily thin tubular neighbourhood of the component of the surgery link , so by ` band move ' we may unambiguously refer to both the move in the @xmath7space and its projection on the plane of @xmath31 . in terms of diagrams ,",
    "the mixed link equivalence in @xmath12 includes the band moves ( two types , depending on the orientation of the little band , which are related by a twist of the little band ; see figure  2 ) . for more details the reader",
    "is referred to @xcite , theorems 5.2 and 5.8 .",
    "let s see now how the mixed link isotopy translates on the level of mixed braids .",
    "a _ braid band move _ is a move between mixed braids , which is a band move between their closures .",
    "it starts with a little band oriented downwards , which , before sliding along a surgery strand , gets one twist _",
    "positive _ or _",
    "negative_. view figure 3 . in the sequel",
    "we shall omit the word ` braid ' and we shall just say ` band move ' .",
    "let @xmath32 be a mixed braid in @xmath12 and @xmath33 a point of an arc of the _ moving subbraid _",
    "@xmath34 such that @xmath33 is not vertically aligned with any crossing .",
    "doing an _ @xmath11move _ at @xmath33 means breaking the arc at @xmath33 , bending the two resulting smaller arcs slightly apart by a small isotopy and stretching them vertically , the upper downwards and the lower upwards , and both _ over _ or _ under _ all other arcs of the diagram , so as to introduce two new corresponding strands with endpoints on the vertical line of @xmath33 . stretching the new strands over will give rise to an _ @xmath35move _ and under to an _",
    "@xmath36move_. see figure 4 .",
    "moves , width=508 ]    using a small braid isotopy , an @xmath11move can be equivalently seen with a crossing ( positive or negative ) formed .",
    "see figure 5 .",
    "move introduces a crossing , width=432 ]    clearly , two mixed braids that differ by an @xmath11move have isotopic closures , since the @xmath11move corresponds to introducing a twist in the mixed link .",
    "@xmath11moves and mixed braid isotopy generate an equivalence relation on mixed braids called _ @xmath11equivalence_. our method of proving the one  move ( and the classical ) markov theorem ( theorem 2.3 in @xcite ) ensures that the arcs of the diagram that are oriented downwards do not participate in the proof .",
    "this led us to the following result ( theorem 5.5 and theorem 5.10 ) , which is our starting point in this paper .",
    "two oriented links in @xmath30 are isotopic if and only if any two corresponding mixed braids in @xmath12 differ by mixed braid isotopy and a finite sequence of @xmath11moves that do not touch the fixed subbraid @xmath16 .    moreover ,",
    "if the two links lie in @xmath19 , the mixed braids differ by mixed braid isotopy , by @xmath11moves that do not touch the fixed subbraid @xmath16 and by braid band moves .",
    "the paper is concerned with the corresponding algebraic formulation .",
    "the braid structures for links in these manifolds ( as well as for links in handlebodies ) have been established and studied in @xcite .",
    "these are either the extended braid groups @xmath2 , whose elements are called _ algebraic mixed braids _ and they have the first @xmath4 strands forming the identity subbraid ( view figure 6 for an example ) , or appropriate cosets @xmath37 of these groups , that depend on the specific manifold .",
    "more precisely , @xmath2 has the presentation : @xmath38 where the generators @xmath9 and @xmath39 are as illustrated in figure 7 .     and",
    "the crossings @xmath39 , width=480 ]    the groups @xmath2 are the appropriate braid structures for studying knots and links in the complement of the @xmath4unlink or a connected sum of @xmath4 lens spaces of type @xmath40 or a handlebody of genus @xmath4 .",
    "for the first two cases of manifolds it is easy to formulate the analogue of markov theorem algebraically ( see first two examples of section 4 ) . in @xcite an algebraic formulation of the markov theorem for handlebodies",
    "was proven in terms of the groups @xmath2 , one version using algebraic @xmath11moves and another using markov equivalence ( cf .",
    "@xcite , theorems 4 and 5 ) . in that case",
    "there was no surgery involved .",
    "the conceptual difficulty there was related to the fact that conjugations by the @xmath9 s were not permitted .",
    "for a generic @xmath41 or @xmath19 the fixed subbraid @xmath16 is not the identity braid .",
    "_ parting _ a mixed braid means to separate its endpoints into two different sets , so that the resulting braids have isotopic closures .",
    "figure 9 illustrates different partings of an abstract mixed braid .",
    "_ combing _ a parted mixed braid means to separate the fixed subbraid from the moving part , using mixed braid isotopy .",
    "see figure 8 for an abstract illustration .",
    "these operations are discussed in detail in section 2 and section 3 . by parting and combing mixed braids ,",
    "it was shown in @xcite , section 6 that knots and links in @xmath14 may be represented by mixed braids in the groups @xmath2 followed by the natural embeddings of @xmath16 in the groups @xmath3 . hence , that the braid structures related to @xmath14 are the cosets of the subgroups @xmath2 in the groups @xmath3 ( @xmath42 ) , containing the embedded fixed subbraid @xmath16 .        * the main results : * the main results of this paper are theorem 4 and",
    "theorem 5 in section 3 .",
    "theorem 4 gives the algebraic braid equivalence of combed mixed braids for knot complements and theorem 5 gives the algebraic braid equivalence of combed mixed braids for closed @xmath7manifolds .",
    "our strategy for proving these theorems is the following .",
    "we first part the mixed braids and we translate the @xmath11equivalence and the braid band moves of theorem  1 to an _ equivalence of parted mixed braids_. here the generators of the groups @xmath2 become apparent in the equivalence .",
    "also , the braid band moves assume a special form .",
    "these are done in section 2 . see theorem 2 for link complements , and lemma 5 and theorem 3 for closed @xmath7manifolds .",
    "in section 3 we comb the parted mixed braids and we translate the parted mixed braid equivalence to an _ equivalence of algebraic mixed braids_. for both link complements and closed @xmath7manifolds , markov move and markov conjugation remain equivalence moves between combed and algebraic mixed braids . but in place of the conjugation by a ` loop ' @xmath9 we need to introduce the _ twisted conjugation _ , which takes into account the combing of the loop through the fixed subbraid : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the combing of the loop @xmath9 through @xmath45 for  @xmath46 .",
    "see figure 19 for illustrations .",
    "moreover , a _ parted band move _ after combing is the _ composition of an algebraic band move with the combing of the parallel strand _ through the surgery subbraid",
    ". an _ algebraic band move _ is a braid band move between elements of the groups @xmath2 and it has the algebraic expression : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a markov conjugate of the loop @xmath49 is the framing of the @xmath50th surgery component of the surgery link and @xmath51 are the words @xmath52 , but with certain substitutions that indicate the pulling of the parallel strand to the right of the braid . see definition 7 and figure 20 .",
    "then , a _ combed band move _ has the algebraic expression : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the combing of the parted parallel strand to the @xmath50th surgery strand through the surgery braid . for an illustration here",
    "see figure 21 .",
    "finally , in section 4 we give explicit examples , including complements of daisy chains , the lens spaces , the complement of the borromean rings or a closed @xmath7manifold obtained by surgery along them .",
    "we also discuss the case where the surgery braid is not a pure braid ( lemma 9 ) and we present as an example the complement of a trefoil or a manifold obtained by surgery along it .",
    "this paper is sequel to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it sets out the necessary algebraic formalism for constructing knot invariants in @xmath7manifolds using braid machinery , for example via constructing markov traces on appropriate algebras , quotients of the group algebras of the braid groups @xmath2 .",
    "( see @xcite for the classical case of links in @xmath12 ) . in the case",
    "@xmath55 , @xmath56 is the artin group of type @xmath57 .",
    "see , for example , @xcite and references therein for the construction of the analogues of the 2variable jones polynomial ( homflypt ) for links in the solid torus .",
    "the case of @xmath40 is being studied in @xcite .",
    "theorem 5 gives a very good control over the band moves of links in closed @xmath7manifolds , and this is very useful for the study of skein modules of @xmath7manifolds .",
    "for skein modules of @xmath7manifolds see , for example , @xcite and references therein .",
    "a final comment is now due . in our set  up the manifold is represented in @xmath12 by a fixed link . in the case of a closed @xmath7manifold the surgery link is not unique up to isotopy .",
    "in fact , it may be altered via the kirby calculus @xcite .",
    "then the corresponding surgery braids are equivalent under moves described in @xcite .",
    "one could then consider combining the mixed braid equivalence given in the present paper with the braid equivalence of @xcite .",
    "this will be the subject of a subsequent paper .",
    "this section is an intermediate step towards the algebrization of theorem  1 . here",
    "the mixed braids resulting from the mixed links have all , say @xmath4 , strands of the fixed part @xmath16 occupying the first @xmath4 positions of the mixed braid .",
    "a _ parted mixed braid _ is a mixed braid @xmath23 on @xmath58 strands , such that the first @xmath4 endpoints are those of the subbraid @xmath16 and the last @xmath1 endpoints are those of @xmath59 parted mixed braids are denoted in the same way as mixed braids .",
    "we number their fixed strands from @xmath60 up to @xmath4 and their moving strands from @xmath60 up to @xmath61 ( see left hand side of figure 14 for an abstract illustration . )      every mixed braid may be represented by a parted mixed braid with isotopic closure ( cf .",
    "section 6 in @xcite , compare with lemma 1 in @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , let @xmath23 be a mixed braid . to see this we simply attach arbitrarily arrays of labels ` o ' or ` u ' to corresponding pairs of endpoints of the moving subbraid @xmath62 , with as many entries as the number of fixed strands on their right , and we pull the strands of corresponding endpoints to the right , _ over _ or _ under _ each strand of @xmath16 that lies on their right , according to the label in the array of the pulled strands .",
    "we start from the rightmost pair respecting the position of the endpoints .",
    "view the first two illustrations of figure 9 for the parting of an abstract mixed braid . obviously , the closures of the initial and of the parted mixed braid are isotopic ( they differ by planar isotopy and by mixed reidemeister ii moves ) .",
    "it follows that two different partings of a mixed braid give rise upon closure to isotopic mixed links . for this reason we could fix the pulling of the moving strands during the parting process to be always over or always under each strand of @xmath16 that lies on its right .",
    "if the pulling is always _ over _ we shall refer to it as _ the standard parting .",
    "_ see the two right illustrations of figure 9 .",
    "pulling a moving strand ` under ' a fixed strand instead of ` over ' , it simply corresponds to the fact that the closure of the moving strand crosses a hypothetical closing arc @xmath50 of the fixed subbraid @xmath16 , and this is an allowed isotopy move in the manifolds considered here .",
    "see figure 10 .",
    "( we note that this is not true in the case of handlebodies and this is the reason why conjugation by the @xmath9 s is not permitted ; see @xcite for a detailed analysis . )",
    "lemma 2 below gives the relation of an arbitrary parting with the corresponding standard parting , and it is very instructive , as it brings the ` loops ' @xmath9 into the parted braid equivalence .",
    "note that the elementary algebraic mixed braids @xmath9 and their inverses , together with the crossings @xmath39 ( all defined in figure  7 ) are clearly the _ geometric generators _ of the moving part of a parted mixed braid .",

    "note that the braid isotopy is independent of the parting labels attached to the @xmath72th moving strand .",

    "see figure 16 for an example of a positive parted band move , where the moving part has been simplified to the identity braid .",
    "a band move may be always assumed , up to @xmath11equivalence , to take place at the top part of a mixed braid and on the right of the specific surgery strand .",
