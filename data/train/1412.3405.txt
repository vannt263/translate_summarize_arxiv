    "recently , in the network science community @xcite , the interest in the geometrical characterizations of real network datasets has been growing .",
    "this problem has indeed many applications related to routing problems in the internet @xcite , data mining and community detection @xcite . at the same time , different definitions of network curvatures have been proposed by mathematicians @xcite , and the characterization of the hyperbolicity of real network datasets has been gaining momentum thanks to the formulation of network models embedded in hyperbolic planes @xcite , and by the definition of delta hyperbolicity of networks by gromov @xcite .",
    "this debate on geometry of networks includes also the discussion of useful metrics for spatial networks @xcite embedded into a physical space and its technological application including wireless networks @xcite .    in the apparently unrelated field of quantum gravity , pregeometric models , where space is an emergent property of a network or of a simplicial complex ,",
    "have attracted large interest over the years @xcite .",
    "whereas in the case of quantum gravity the aim is to obtain a continuous spacetime structure at large scales , the underlying simplicial structure from which geometry should emerge bears similarities to networks . therefore we think that similar models taylored more specifically to our desired network structure ( especially growing networks ) could develop emergent geometrical properties as well .    here our aim is to propose a pregeometric model for emergent complex network geometry , in which the non - equilibrium dynamical rules do not take into account any embedding space , but during its evolution the network develops a certain heterogeneous distribution of curvatures , a small - world topology characterized by high clustering and small average distance , a modular structure and a finite spectral dimension .    in the last decades",
    "the most popular framework for describing the evolution of complex systems has been the one of growing network models @xcite . in particular growing complex networks evolving by the preferential attachment mechanism",
    "have been widely used to explain the emergence of the scale - free degree distributions which are ubiquitous in complex networks . in this scenario ,",
    "the network grows by the addition of new nodes and these nodes are more likely to link to nodes already connected to many other nodes according to the preferential attachment rule . in this case",
    "the probability that a node acquires a new link is proportional to the degree of the node . the simplest version of these models , the barabasi - albert ( ba ) model @xcite , can be modified @xcite in order to describe complex networks that also have a large clustering coefficient , another important and ubiquitous property of complex networks that characterizes small - world networks @xcite together with the small typical distance between the nodes",
    "moreover , it has been recently observed @xcite that growing network models inspired by the ba model and enforcing a high clustering coefficient , using the so called triadic closure mechanism , are able to display a non trivial community structure @xcite .",
    "finally , complex social , biological and technological networks not only have high clustering but also have a structure which suggests that the networks have an hidden embedding space , describing the similarity between the nodes .",
    "for example the local structure of protein - protein interaction networks , analysed with the tools of graphlets , suggests that these networks have an underlying non - trivial geometry @xcite .",
    "another interesting approach to complex networks suggests that network models evolving in a hyperbolic plane might model and approximate a large variety of complex networks @xcite . in this framework nodes",
    "are embedded in a hidden metric structure of constant negative curvature that determine their evolution in such a way that nodes closer in space are more likely to be connected .",
    "but is it really always the case that the hidden embedding space is causing the network dynamics or might it be that this effective hidden metric space is the outcome of the network evolution ?    here",
    "we want to adopt a growing network framework in order to describe the emergence of geometry in evolving networks .",
    "we start from non - equilibrium growing dynamics independent of any hidden embedding space , and we show that spatial properties of the network emerge spontaneously .",
    "these networks are the skeleton of growing simplicial complexes that are constructed by gluing together simplices of given dimension .",
    "in particular in this work we focus on simplicial complexes built by gluing together triangles and imposing that the number of triangles incident to a link can not be larger than a fixed number @xmath0 that parametrizes the network dynamics . in this way",
    "we provide evidence that the proposed stylized model , including only two parameters , can give rise to a wide variety of network geometries and can be considered a starting point for characterizing emergent space in complex networks .",
    "finally we compare the properties of real complex system datasets with the structural and geometric properties of the growing geometrical model showing that despite the fact that the proposed model is extremely stylized , it captures main features observed in a large variety of datasets .",
    "metric spaces satisfy the triangular inequality . therefore in spatial networks",
    "we must have that if a node @xmath1 connects two nodes ( the node @xmath2 and the node @xmath3 ) , these two must be connected by a path of short distance .",
    "therefore , if we want to describe the spontaneous emergence of a discrete geometric space , in absence of an embedding space and a metric , it is plausible that starting from growing simplicial complexes should be an advantage .",
    "these structures are formed by gluing together complexes of dimension @xmath4 , i.e. fully connected networks , or cliques , formed by @xmath5 nodes , such as triangles , tetrahedra etc . for simplicity ,",
    "let us here consider growing networks constructed by addition of connected complexes of dimension @xmath6 , i.e. triangles .",
    "we distinguish between two cases : the case in which a link can belong to an arbitrarily large number of triangles ( @xmath7 ) , and the case in which each link can belong at most to a finite number @xmath0 of triangles . in the case in which @xmath0 is finite we call the links to which we can still add at least one triangle unsaturated .",
    "all the other links we call saturated .",
    "triangles incident to it . in process",
    "( b ) with probability @xmath8 two nodes at distance two in the simplicial complex are connected and all the possible triangles that can link these two nodes are added as long as this is allowed ( no link acquires more than @xmath0 triangles incident to it ) .",

    "@xmath21 , then we choose one random unsaturated link adjacent either to node @xmath1 or node @xmath2 as long as this link is not already part of a triangle including node @xmath1 and node @xmath2 .",

    "otherwise we do nothing .    with the above algorithm ( see supplementary information for the matlab code ) we describe a growing simplicial complex formed by adding triangles . from this structure",
    "we can extract the corresponding network where we consider only the information about node connectivity ( which node is linked to which other node ) .",
    "we call this network model the geometrical growing network . in figure 1",
    "we show schematically the dynamical rules for building the growing simplicial complexes and the geometrical growing networks that describe its skeleton .    , @xmath29 a random planar geometry is formed . in the case",
    "@xmath7 , @xmath29 a scale - free network with power - law exponent @xmath30 and non trivial community structure and clustering coefficient is formed . in the intermediate case @xmath31 a network with broad degree distribution , small - world properties and finite spectral dimension is formed .",
    "the colours here indicate division into communities found by running the leuven algorithm @xcite.,width=604 ]    let us comment on two fundamental limits of this dynamics . in the case",
    "@xmath7 , @xmath32 , the network is scale - free and in the class of growing networks with preferential attachment .",
    "in fact the probability that we add a link to a generic node @xmath1 of the network using process @xmath33 is simply proportional to the number of links connected to it , i.e. its degree @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , the mean - field equations for the degree @xmath34 of a generic node @xmath1 are equal to the equations valid for the ba model , i.e. they yield a scale - free network with power - law exponent @xmath30",
    ". actually this limit of our model was already discussed in @xcite as a simple and major example of scale - free network . for @xmath9 , instead",
    ", the degree distribution can be shown to be exponential ( see methods and supplementary material for details ) .",
    "the euler characteristic @xmath35 of our simplicial complex and the corresponding network is given by = n - l+t where @xmath36 indicates the total number of nodes , @xmath37 the total number of links and @xmath38 the total number of triangles in the network .",
    "for @xmath9 and any value of @xmath8 , or for @xmath32 and any value of @xmath0 the networks are planar graphs since the non - planar subgraphs @xmath39 ( complete graph of five nodes ) and @xmath40 ( complete bipartite graph formed by two sets of three nodes ) are excluded from the dynamical rules ( see methods for details ) .",
    "therefore in these cases we have an euler characteristic @xmath41 ( in fact here we do not count the external face ) .",
    "in general the proposed growing geometric network model can generate a large variety of network geometries . in figure 2",
    "we show a visualization of single instances of the growing geometrical networks in the cases @xmath9 , @xmath29 ( random planar geometry ) , @xmath7 , @xmath42 ( scale - free geometry ) , and @xmath43 , @xmath29 .    , the distribution of curvature @xmath44 , and the average clustering coefficient @xmath45 of nodes of degree @xmath3 for networks of sizes @xmath46 , parameter @xmath8 chosen as either @xmath32 or @xmath29 , and different values of @xmath47 .",
    "the network has exponential degree distribution for @xmath9 and scale - free degree distribution for @xmath7 . for @xmath48 and @xmath49 it shows broad degree distribution .",

    "the role of the parameter @xmath0 is to fix the maximal number of triangles incident on each link .",
    "the role of the parameter @xmath8 is to allow for a non - trivial k - core structure of the network .",
    "in fact , if @xmath32 the network can be completely pruned if we remove nodes of degree @xmath54 recursively , similarly to what happens in the ba model , while for @xmath48 the geometrical growing network has a non - trivial @xmath55-core . moreover the process @xmath56 can be used to  freeze \" some region of the network . in order to see this ,",
    "let us consider the role of the process @xmath56 occurring with probability @xmath8 in the case of a network with @xmath9 . then for @xmath32 , each node will increase its connectivity indefinitely with time having always exactly two unsaturated links attached to it . on the contrary , if @xmath48 there is a small probability that some nodes will have all adjacent links saturated , and a degree that is frozen and does not grow any more . a typical network of this type is shown for @xmath57 in figure 2 where one can clearly distinguish between an active boundary of the network where still many triangles can be linked and a frozen bulk region of the network .     from the initial triangle and euler characteristic @xmath35 as a function of the network size @xmath36 .",
    "* the geometrical network model is growing exponentially , with @xmath58 . here",
    "we show the data @xmath47 and @xmath29 ( panel a ) .",

    ", width=453 ]    the geometrical growing networks have highly heterogeneous structure reflected in their local properties .",
    "for example , the degree distribution is scale - free for @xmath7 and exponential for @xmath9 for any value of @xmath8 .",
    "moreover for finite values of @xmath49 the degree distribution can develop a tail that is broader for increasing values of @xmath0 ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "furthermore , in figure 3 we plot the average clustering coefficient @xmath45 of nodes of degree @xmath3 showing that the geometrical growing networks are hierarchical @xcite , they have a clustering coefficient @xmath59 with values of @xmath51 that are typically @xmath60 .",
    "another important and geometrical local property is the curvature , defined on each node of the network . for either @xmath9 and any value of @xmath8 or for @xmath32 and any value of @xmath0 ,",
    "the generated graph is a planar network of which all faces are triangles .",
    "therefore we consider the curvature @xmath61 @xcite given by r_i=1-+ , [ lk ] where @xmath34 is the degree of node @xmath1 , and @xmath62 is the number of triangles passing through node @xmath1 .",
    "we observe that the definition of the curvature satisfies the gauss - bonnet theorem = _",
    "i=1^n r_i . for a planar network , for bulk nodes which have @xmath63 the curvature reduces to r_i=1- and for nodes at the boundary for which @xmath64",

    "this simple relation between the curvature @xmath61 and the degree @xmath34 allows to characterize the distribution of curvatures in the network easily . the curvature is intuitively related to the degree of the node . as all triangles are isosceles , a bulk node with degree six has zero curvature .",
    "in fact the sum of the angles of the triangles incident to the node is @xmath66 .",

    "here we decided to continue to use the definition given by eq .",
    "this is equivalent to the definition of curvature by oliver knill @xcite , in which the curvature @xmath61 at a node @xmath1 is defined as r_i=_n=1^n ( -1)^n+1 [ ru ] where @xmath74 are the number of simplices of @xmath75 nodes and dimension @xmath76 to which node @xmath1 belongs . in fact",

    "+ for @xmath32 the curvature distribution is dominated by a negative unbounded tail that is exponential in the case @xmath9 and power - law in the case @xmath7 .",
    "in particular while the average curvature is @xmath79 for @xmath32 and any value of @xmath0 , in the limit @xmath80 the fluctuations around this average are finite ( i.e. @xmath81 ) for @xmath9 , and infinite ( i.e. @xmath82 ) for @xmath7 .",
    "we note here that in the ba model the clustering coefficient @xmath83 of any node @xmath1 vanishes in the large network limit , therefore the curvature @xmath84 , and the curvature distribution has a power - law negative tail and diverging @xmath85 in the large network limit , similarly to the case @xmath7 and @xmath32 of the present model .    for a general value of @xmath8",
    ", we can assume that the average clustering @xmath45 of nodes of degree @xmath3 , scales as @xmath50 .",
    "then the average number of triangles @xmath86 of nodes of degree @xmath3 scales as @xmath87 .",
    "therefore , for large @xmath3 and as long as @xmath53 the average curvature of nodes of degree @xmath3 @xmath88 , is dominated by the contribution of triangles and scales like @xmath89 with a positive tail for large values of @xmath3 .",
    "this allows us to distinguish the phase diagram in two different regions according to the value of the exponent @xmath51 : the case @xmath53 in which the curvature has a positive tail , and the case @xmath90 in which the curvature can have a negative tail .",
    "+ we make here two main observations .",
    "first of all , with the definition of the curvature given by eq .",
    "@xmath73 , our network model has heterogeneous distribution of curvatures .",
    "therefore here we are characterizing highly heterogeneous geometries and the geometrical growing network does not have a constant curvature .",
    "this is one of the main differences of the present model compared to network models embedded in the hyperbolic plane @xcite .",
    "in particular all the networks with @xmath9 or @xmath32 have @xmath41 and therefore the average curvature is zero in the thermodynamical limit , but they have a curvature distribution with an unbounded negative tail that can be either exponential for @xmath9 ( i.e. @xmath81 ) or scale - free as for the case @xmath7 ( i.e. @xmath82 ) . + we illustrate this in figure 3 where we plot the distribution @xmath44 of curvatures for different specific models of growing geometrical networks for @xmath32 and @xmath29 for different values of @xmath0 . we show that for @xmath32 the negative tail can be either exponential or scale - free .",
    "for @xmath29 we have for @xmath9 a negative exponential tail and for @xmath7 a positive scale - free tail of the curvature distribution consistent with a value of the exponent @xmath53 and a power - law degree distribution . +",
    "our second observation is that the case @xmath9 and @xmath32 is significantly different from the case @xmath49 and @xmath48 .",
    "in fact for @xmath9 and for @xmath32 the euler characteristic of the network is @xmath41 and never increases in time ( see methods for details ) , while for the case @xmath49 , @xmath48 we expect @xmath91 to go to a finite limit as @xmath36 goes to infinity . in figure 4 the numerical results of the euler characteristic @xmath35 as a function of the network size @xmath36 shows that , for @xmath49 and @xmath92 , @xmath35 grows linearly with @xmath36 .",
    "the quantity @xmath93 gives the average curvature in the network and is therefore zero for @xmath9 and @xmath32 .",
    "the generated topologies are small - world .",
    "in fact they combine high clustering coefficient with a typical distance between the nodes increasing only logarithmically with the network size .",
    "the exponential growth of the network is to be expected by the observation that in these networks we always have that the total number of links as well as the number of unsaturated links scale linearly with time .",
    "this corresponds to a physical situation in which the  volume \" ( total number of links ) is proportional to the  surface \" ( number of unsaturated links ) .",
    "therefore we should expect that the typical distance of the nodes in the network should grow logarithmically with the network size @xmath36 . in order to check this , in figure 4",
    "we give @xmath94 , the average distance of the nodes from the initial triangle over the different network realisations as a function of the network size @xmath36 . from this figure",
    "it is clear that asymptotically in time @xmath95 , independently of the value of @xmath8 and @xmath0 .",
    "the effects of randomness and emergent locality in these networks are reflected by their cluster structure , revealed by the lower bound on their maximal modularity measured by running efficient community detection algorithms @xcite ( figure 5 )",
    ". moreover also their clustering coefficient provides evidence for their emergent locality ( figure 5 ) .",
    "finally we observe that for @xmath48 the network develops also a non - trivial k - core structure . in order to show this in figure 5 we also plot the value of @xmath55 corresponding to the maximal @xmath55-core of the network .",
    "as we already mentioned , for @xmath32 we have @xmath96 and the network can be completely pruned by removing the triangles recursively . for @xmath48 instead , the maximal @xmath55-core can have a much larger value of @xmath55 , as shown in figure 5 for a network of @xmath69 nodes .",
    "therefore these structures are different from the small world model to the extent that they are always characterised by a non - trivial community and @xmath55-core structure .",
    "the geometrical growing network is growing exponentially , so the hausdorff dimension is infinite .",
    "nevertheless , these networks develop a finite spectral dimension @xmath97 as clearly shown in figure 6 , for @xmath98 and @xmath29 .",
    "we have checked that also for other values of @xmath8 the spectral dimension remains finite .",
    "this is a clear indication that these networks have non - trivial diffusion properties .",
    "the geometrical growing network model is therefore a very stylized model with interesting limiting behaviour , in which geometrical local and global parameters can emerge spontaneously from the non - equilibrium dynamics .",
    "moreover here we compare the properties of the geometric growing network with the properties of a variety of real datasets .",
    "in particular we have considered network datasets coming from biological , social , and technological systems and we have analysed their properties . in table 1 we show that in several cases large modularity , large clustering , small average distance and non - trivial maximal @xmath55-core structure emerge . moreover , in these datasets a non - trivial distribution of curvature ( defined as in eq .",
    "( [ lk ] ) ) is present , showing either negative or positive tail ( see figure 7 ) .",
    "finally the laplacian spectrum of these networks also displays a power - law tail from which an effective finite spectral dimension can be calculated ( see table 1 and supplementary information for details ) .",
    "this shows that the geometrical growing network models have many properties in common with real datasets , describing biological , social , and technological systems , and should therefore be used and modified to model several real network datasets .",
    "in conclusion , this paper shows that growing simplicial complexes and the corresponding growing geometrical networks are characterized by the spontaneous emergence of locality and spatial properties .",
    "in fact small - world properties , non - trivial community structure , and even finite spectral dimensions are emerging in these networks despite the fact that their dynamical rules do not depend on any embedding space .",
    "these growing networks are determined by non - equilibrium stochastic dynamics and provide evidence that it is possible to generate random complex self - organized geometries by simple stochastic rules .",
    "an open question in this context is to determine the underlying metric for these networks .",
    "in particular we believe that the investigation of the hyperbolic character of the models with @xmath9 and @xmath32 ( that have zero average curvature but a negative third moment of the distribution of curvature ) should be extremely interesting to shed new light on  random geometries \" in which the curvature can have finite or infinite deviations from its average .",
    "a full description of their structure using tools of geometric group theory could be envisaged to solve this problem .",
    "this analysis could be facilitated also by the study of the dual network in which each triangle is a node of maximal degree @xmath99 .",
    "in fact each edge of the triangle is at most incident to other @xmath0 triangles in the geometrical growing network .",
    "furthermore we mention that the model can be generalized in two main directions . on the one hand",
    "the model can be extended by considering geometrical growing networks built by gluing together simplices of higher dimension . on the other hand",
    ", one can explore methods to generate networks that have a finite hausdorff dimension , i.e. that they have a typical distance between the nodes scaling like a power of the total number of nodes in the network .",
    "another interesting direction of further theoretical investigation is to consider the equilibrium models of networks ( ensembles of networks ) in which a constraint on the total number of triangles incident to a link is imposed , similarly to recent works that have considered ensembles with given degree correlations and average clustering coefficient @xmath45 of nodes of degree @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "finally the geometrical growing network is a very stylized model and includes the essential ingredients for describing the emergence of locality of the interactions in complex networks and can be used in a variety of fields in which networks and discrete spaces are important , including complex networks with clustering such as biological , social , and technological networks .",

    "therefore the average number of links that a node gains at time @xmath104 by process @xmath33 is given by @xmath119 for @xmath120 .",
    "the master equations for the average number of nodes @xmath106 that have degree @xmath3 at time @xmath104 are given by n(k , t+1)=n(k , t)+n(k-1 , t)-n(k , t)+_k , 2 . in the large time limit , in which @xmath108 , the degree distribution @xmath107 is given by p(k)=()^k-1 for @xmath113 .",
    "the curvature @xmath114 is therefore in average @xmath79 in the limit @xmath121 with finite second moment @xmath85 .",
    "the euler characteristic of the geometrical growing networks with @xmath32 is @xmath41 at every time .",
    "in fact we start from a single triangle , therefore at @xmath122 we have @xmath41 . at each time step",
    "we attach a new triangle to a given unsaturated link , therefore we add one new node , two new links , and one new triangle , so that @xmath123 .",
    "hence @xmath41 for every network size . for @xmath9 also",
    "the process @xmath56 does not increase the euler characteristic .",

    "the modularity @xmath101 is a measure to evaluate the significance of the community structure of a network .",
    "it is defined @xcite as m=_ij(a_ij-)(q_i , q_j )  . here",

    "therefore different greedy algorithms have been proposed to find the community structure such as the leuven method @xcite that we have used in this study .",
    "the modularity found in this way is a lower bound on the maximal modularity of the network .",
    "the clustering coefficient is given by the probability that two nodes , both connected to a common node , are also connected .",
    "in the context of social networks , it describes the probability that a friend of a friend is also your friend .",
    "the local clustering coefficient @xmath83 of node @xmath1 has been defined as the probability that two neighbours of the node @xmath1 are neighbours of each other , c_i=  , where @xmath62 is the number of triangles passing through node @xmath1 , and @xmath34 is the degree of node @xmath1 .",
    "we define the @xmath55-core of a network as the maximal subgraph formed by the set of nodes that have at least @xmath55 links connecting them to the other nodes of the @xmath55-core .",
    "the @xmath55-core of a network can be easily obtained by pruning a given network , i.e. by removing iteratively all the nodes @xmath1 with degree @xmath127 .      the laplacian matrix of the network @xmath37 has elements l_ij = k_i_ij - a_ij .",
    "if the density of eigenvalues @xmath128 of the laplacian scales like g()~^d_s/2 - 1 with @xmath129 , for small values of @xmath130 , then @xmath97 is called the spectral dimension of the network . for regular lattices in dimension",
