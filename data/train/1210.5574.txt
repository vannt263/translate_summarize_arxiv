    "nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) centers in diamond have recently attracted attention within the fields of quantum information science @xcite and optical magnetometry @xcite .",
    "much of the focus has been on single nv centers , and impressive results have been obtained , such as quantum entanglement @xcite and nanoscale imaging with single spins @xcite .",
    "here we focus on an ensemble of nv centers which can be utilized as a very sensitive @xmath0 m to mm sized sensor for magnetic fields @xcite .      in optical magnetometry",
    "@xcite , magnetic resonance between two ground states , which are split by a magnetic field @xmath1 , is excited with a properly modulated light or magnetic field , where the modulation typically corresponds to radio - frequency or microwave ( mw ) range .",
    "the magnetic resonance is measured optically and the magnetic field is determined from the center modulation frequency @xmath2 corresponding to the magnetic resonance . to be able to determine the center frequency of the optically detected magnetic resonance ( odmr ) signal and thereby the magnetic field with high precision ,",
    "a narrow linewidth @xmath3 is desired .",
    "the magnetometer signal is proportional to @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the contrast of the odmr signal .",
    "if the main source of noise is shot noise of the detected light , the magnetic field - sensitivity ( measured in @xmath6 ) and also the noise - to - signal ratio will be proportional to @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the light power .",
    "both the contrast and the linewidth depend on the mw power and the light power . to achieve high magnetic field - sensitivity one therefore needs to optimize the mw power and the light power .",
    "the dependence of the magnetometer signal on mw power and light power is now discussed . in general , both the contrast and the linewidth increase with mw power . in atom - light interactions ,",
    "typically , the linewidth also increases with increasing light power .",
    "however , in some situations , the linewidth can decrease with increasing light power .",
    "this phenomenon is called light narrowing , with an early observation in an optically pumped alkali vapor reported in ref .  .",
    "in that work power broadening due to the mw field was reduced when the light power was increased . a similar light - narrowing effect on nv centers in diamond",
    "is the topic of this paper .",
    "a different type of light narrowing , which occurs even in the absence of mw power broadening , was demonstrated in ref .   and .",
    "there the linewidth was reduced due to the suppression of spin - exchange collisions when the alkali vapor became more and more polarized with increasing light power .",
    "this latter effect , however , does not appear to have a direct relation to this work .",
    "light narrowing of a power - broadened magnetic resonance can be understood using a two - level model pictured in fig .",
    "[ fig : setuplevels](a ) . consider a single nv center ( or atom ) with two relevant ground states @xmath9 and @xmath10 which are coupled by a mw magnetic field with coupling strength given by the on - resonance rabi frequency @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is measured in rad / s and @xmath13 is the mw power .",
    "the longitudinal and transverse relaxation times of the atom are denoted @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and the corresponding decay rates are denoted @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we assume that the system can be optically pumped into the state @xmath9 with a `` pump rate '' @xmath18 .",

    "the signal is the detected fluorescence from the nv centers .",
    "the signal is maximal off - resonance because optical pumping of the nv center leads to increased population of the @xmath9 state which fluoresces stronger than the @xmath10 state .",
    "when the mw field is on - resonance , population is transfered from the @xmath9 state to the @xmath10 state leading to reduced fluorescence .",
    "the width of the resonance @xmath3 can be expressed as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the rabi frequency measured in hz .",
    "the `` effective '' relaxation times depend on the optical - pumping rate : @xmath26 and @xmath27 . for low mw power",
    "the width of the magnetic resonance is approximately @xmath28 .",
    "increasing the mw power leads to power broadening , and for high mw power the fwhm @xmath29 equals the rabi frequency magnified by the factor @xmath30 .    for an ensemble of nv centers in type 1b diamond ( nitrogen density @xmath31 ppm ) , representative values for room - temperature intrinsic relaxation times ( i.e. , in the absence of light and microwaves ) are @xmath32 @xcite and @xmath33 @xcite and thereby differ by 3 orders of magnitude . in our experiment ,",

    "although it is probably most natural to assume that @xmath51 is gaussian , we will assume that @xmath51 is lorentzian .",
    "this is done mainly because one can obtain a simple analytical formula for the total width [ eq .

    "nv centers in diamond occur in at least two charge states , nv@xmath56 and nv@xmath57 , where the negatively charged center is of primary interest since it is possible to optically polarize and readout the nv@xmath57 spin state .",

    "we also demonstrate light narrowing with the s3 diamond sample which has a lower concentration of both @xmath89 centers ( @xmath90 ppm ) and nitrogen impurities ( @xmath91 ppm ) ( for details of the s3 sample see ref .  ) . due to the lower impurity concentration ,",
    "the s3 sample has less inhomogeneous broadening compared to the s5 sample ( @xmath92 ns for the s3 sample compared to @xmath93 ns for the s5 sample ) .",

    "we would therefore not expect any visible side resonances in the s3 sample .",
    "the rate of mw - induced simultaneous spin - flips @xmath99 should depend on several parameters including p1 concentration , mw detuning from the side resonances at @xmath100 , mw power and light power .",
    "we note that the mechanism behind the mw - induced simultaneous spin - flips is rather complicated . a detailed analysis of how nv - p1 interactions change the odmr spectrum is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we would instead like a simple model for how the mw - induced simultaneous spin - flips of nv and p1 centers influence the width of the magnetic resonance centered at @xmath2 .",
    "spin - flips of the nv electron spin due to interaction with p1 centers can be thought of as a source of @xmath14-relaxation for the nv centers .",

    ", we will neglect the detuning dependence of the spin - flip rate .",
    "this assumption should be valid since the side resonances are well separated from the resonance centered at @xmath2 , and since we only are interested in the effect of the simultaneous spin - flips on the width of the resonance centered at @xmath2 .    since the contrast of",
    "the side resonances increase with increasing mw power , the spin - flip rate should also increase with increasing mw power . the exact dependence on the mw power is not known , but we will assume that the rate is proportional to mw power , or equivalent , the square of the rabi frequency .",
    "we will also assume that the rate of spin - flips saturate for high mw powers .",
    "we end up with the following empirical formula for the spin - flip rate : @xmath102 the saturation rabi frequency @xmath103 and the proportionality constant @xmath104 and its dependence on light power will be determined from the experimental data .",
