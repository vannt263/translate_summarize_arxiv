    "we now look at whether there are other types of pulse sequences similar to those above which can achieve the same fidelity . the most general 3-pulse sequence is , @xmath65    as before we define axes @xmath66 and @xmath3 in the @xmath5-plane of the bloch sphere by the angles @xmath67 and @xmath8 respectively .",
    "the first condition to satisfy is that the pulse sequence must be symmetric so that it can be reduced using the symmetric bch formula , thus keeping the fidelity for the total pulse sequence 6@xmath2 order in @xmath1 .",
    "this means we need @xmath68 and @xmath69 . also to satisfy the condition that @xmath70 ,",
    "we require , @xmath71    we are then left with sequences of the form , @xmath72    finally , we let the first derivative of the total pulse sequence with respect to @xmath1 equal zero at @xmath16 and obtain the constraint , @xmath73    giving @xmath74 with @xmath75 and @xmath76 the most general 3-pulse sequences are @xmath77 with @xmath67 determined from , @xmath78    for even @xmath79 , @xmath80    meaning that either @xmath81 or @xmath82 .",
    "hence @xmath83 since @xmath84 .",
    "similarily , @xmath85 , i.e. @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the same is true for odd @xmath79 except @xmath88 .",
    "we are left with the general 3-pulse sequences , @xmath89    the @xmath62 family is obtained from repeating the @xmath90 sequence @xmath58 times . when @xmath91 , the `` passband '' wimperis sequence @xcite is recovered .",
    "moreover , these are the only 3-pulse sequences which achieve this 6@xmath2 order fidelity .",
    "the first three of these composite sequences are plotted in fig .",
    "in other 3-pulse sequences , the first order term in the fidelity always disappears due to the fact that by collapsing the entire pulse sequence using the bch formula to , @xmath92    the fidelity is @xmath93 and the leading term in @xmath94 is @xmath95 .",
    "so there are no pulse sequences constructed from 3 pulses which achieve this 6@xmath2 order dependence for the fidelity for the resulting rotation other than the above family of pulse sequences .",
    "there is , however , the option of creating a 5-pulse sequence by introducing a third axis .",
    "the general form for such a sequence is , @xmath96    we define the axes @xmath97 and @xmath98 in the @xmath5-plane of the bloch sphere by the angles @xmath99 and @xmath8 respectively .",
    "@xmath98 is now the axis around which we wish to rotate by @xmath7 .",
    "again , we will require @xmath100,@xmath101 and @xmath102 in order to keep symmetry in the sequence and hence the 6@xmath2 order fidelity dependence . in order that the pulse sequence is the identity when @xmath16 , we need to satisfy , @xmath103 the first derivative of the total pulse sequence is zero at @xmath16 when @xmath104 , @xmath105 for positive integers @xmath79 and @xmath106 .",
    "we arrive at general 5-pulse sequences of the form , @xmath107    where @xmath108 and @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath109 are determined from , @xmath110    one solution to find 5-pulse sequences is at @xmath111 , analogously to the 3-pulse sequence case . in this case",
    "@xmath112 and , as it must remain an integer , @xmath113 must be a multiple of 3 with now @xmath114 .",
    "( 11 ) is satisfied for @xmath115 when @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 for a rotation around the -@xmath10-axis .",
    "however , while the fidelity displays a 6@xmath2 order dependence on the fractional error , the coefficient of the leading term , shown in table [ table1 ] , is so much larger that the sequence is only better than the error - prone pulse for small values of @xmath1 ( @xmath119 0.2 )",
    ". the situation does not improve for higher values of @xmath79 and so these sequences are of no real practical use .",
    "another 5-pulse sequence which achieves the same 6@xmath2 order dependence for the fidelity is found by setting @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 .",
    "( 11 ) is now satisfied when @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 for a rotation around the -@xmath10-axis ( @xmath126 ) .",
    "as before , other axes may be accounted for by phase - shifting each pulse by the appropriate angle .",
    "the fidelity of this sequence is much better than the previous 5-pulse sequence and is quite close to that of the pb1 sequence as seen in fig .",
    "other sequences can be constructed by varying @xmath79 , @xmath106 and @xmath127 .",
    "we have presented an analysis of the composite pulse sequences presented by jones _",
    "@xcite to combat systematic pulse - length errors in single - qubit rotations .",
    "we have derived an explicit form for the fidelity and shown how it is possible to set up other 3-pulse sequences which achieve the same order error dependence for the fidelity .",
    "we have shown that there are also 5-pulse sequences which do achieve the 6@xmath2 order dependency of the fidelity on the error .    * acknowledgement * + d. mchugh kindly acknowledges support from enterprise - ireland basic research grant sc/1999/080 .",
