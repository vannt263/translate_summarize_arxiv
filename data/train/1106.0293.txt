    "the problem of the permanent confinement of quarks inside hadrons attracts attention of the theoretical physicists for the last three decades ( see @xcite and refs . therein for a review of the problem ) .",
    "two of the most popular and the most elaborated mechanisms of confinement are based on the condensation of certain topologically nontrivial configurations - the so - called center vortices or monopoles . in this paper",
    "we are interested in the second of these configurations .",
    "it was proposed in the context of continuum compact three dimensional ( @xmath1 ) electrodynamics that the string tension is nonvanishing in this theory at any positive coupling constant @xcite .",
    "configurations responsible for such behaviour have been identified as monopoles of the compact theory .",
    "the contribution of monopoles to the wilson loop was estimated in the semiclassical approximation .",
    "later this consideration was extended to @xmath1 @xmath3 lattice gauge theory ( lgt ) @xcite .",
    "a rigorous proof of the confinement was constructed in @xcite .",
    "while the monopoles of abelian gauge models can be given a gauge invariant definition , it is not the case for nonabelian models ( see , however @xcite for discussion of this point ) .",
    "the most popular approach to the problem consists of a partial gauge fixing such that some abelian subgroup of the full nonabelian group remains unbroken .",
    "then , one can define monopoles in a nonabelian theory as monopoles of the unbroken abelian subgroup . here",
    "we propose a different way to identify monopole configurations in nonabelian models .",
    "its main feature is a complete gauge fixing .",
    "monopoles appear as defects of smooth gauge fields which violate the bianchi identity in the continuum limit , in the full analogy with abelian models .",
    "our principal approach is to rewrite the compact lgt in the plaquette ( continuum field - strength ) representation and to find a dual form of the nonabelian theory .",
    "the bianchi identity appears in such formulation as a condition on the admissible configurations of the plaquette variables .",
    "this allows to reveal the relevant field configurations contributing to the partition function and various observables .",
    "such a program was accomplished for the abelian lgt in @xcite .",
    "here we are going to work out the corresponding approach for nonabelian models on the example of @xmath1 @xmath0 lgt .",
    "our strategy is to represent the action of the model in the plaquette formulation in the form that generalizes the abelian `` monopole + photon '' effective action . in the @xmath0 case the dual gluon field carries colour index and the monopoles",
    "are coupled to the length of the dual auxiliary field . as a result , the gluon - monopole coupling is nonlinear . to treat this problem",
    "we solve classical equations with the help of a certain anzatz . performing standard procedure@xcite we rewrite the effective monopole action in the form of the sine - gordon theory . in some approximation",
    "we get an area law for the wilson loop in the fundamental ( and all half - integer ) representation .",

    "we derive the effective monopole action .",

    "a we give an approximate solution of the classical equation of the sine - gordon model for the adjoint representation ( also valid for @xmath5 abelian case ) . in appendix",
    "b we discuss some aspects of the strong coupling expansion of the wilson loop in the plaquette representation .",

    "the first term in ( [ u1_s_cl ] ) corresponds to a perimeter contribution from dual photons ( confining logarithmic potential in @xmath1 ) .",
    "following the strategy of @xcite one can use the dilute monopole gas approximation to perform summation over monopole charges @xmath48 .",
    "we skip all technical details which are well known .",

    "the semiclassical estimation of the string tension for @xmath50 predicts @xmath51 which appears to be a lower bound on the exact string tension@xcite .",
    "finding correct @xmath4 dependence of the string tension remains an open problem .",
    "e.g. , it has been argued in@xcite that the string tension has the following dependence on @xmath4 @xmath52    however , semiclassical approximation for the wilson loops in higher representations ( @xmath53 ) developed in @xcite led to the result @xmath54 moreover , as can be seen from bounds of @xcite ( formula 8.3 ) , the string tension might well behave as @xmath55    usually , semiclassical estimations are obtained in @xmath56 approximation .",
    "it was stressed in @xcite that in this approximation one can not construct solutions leading to ( [ j_m ] ) and/or ( [ j^2_m ] ) .",
    "one should probably go beyond @xmath56 approach to get the correct @xmath4-dependence .",
    "a hint on this can be found in the strong coupling expansion for the wilson loop .",

    "however , diagrams contributing to the @xmath57 wilson loop a big size are essentially three - dimentional .",
    "the @xmath58-dependence holds for the loops of middle sizes ( see [ abelianized_str_tens ] ) .",
    "therefore , in both these cases the @xmath56 approximation is not valid . in appendix",

    "our result agrees with the formula ( [ j_m ] ) .",
    "all this will be relevant in our discussion of @xmath0 model , namely concerning solution of sine - gordon equation in the next subsection .",
    "here we would like to calculate the contribution of monopole configurations to the partition function and to the wilson loop of @xmath0 lgt .",
    "in doing so we use some approximations .",
    "first of them is related to the fact that at large @xmath59 all plaquette matrices fluctuate smoothly around unit matrix .",
    "but if we want to take into account nontrivial monopole configurations one can not expand fields @xmath60 and @xmath61 in ( [ pfwk ] ) around the trivial vacuum .",
    "we should make an expansion of the action , the invariant measure and the jacobian around nontrivial monopole configurations .",
    "to construct such expansion we solve classical equations for fields @xmath26 and @xmath61 making use certain anzatz which allows us to get rid of the nonlinear term @xmath62 .",
    "after the solution is constructed we expand the effective action around this solution .",
    "actually , we restrict ourselves only to the classical action .",
    "it should be mentioned that the connectors vanish in this approximation due to the anzatz chosen . to take into account their contribution",
    ", one has to keep fluctuations in the effective action . in the present work we neglect connectors .",
    "the main motivation for this approach comes from @xcite where it has been shown that connectors do not contribute to the fundamental wilson loop in the leading orders of the strong coupling expansion .",
    "thus , we may hope our approximation still captures the main confining effect .",
    "nevertheless , it turns out that connectors are essential ingredients in reproducing the correct string tension for the wilson loop in higher representations , in particular in reproducing the @xmath63-ality dependence , and this is true even in the strong coupling regime .",
    "we demonstrate this in the appendix b.    consider the wilson loop in the representation @xmath4 . in the parameterization ( [ v_l ] ) the expectation value of @xmath64 ( [ wldual1 ] ) at @xmath65 we present in the form @xmath66 where @xmath67    write down the classical equations for fields @xmath26 and @xmath61 @xmath68 where @xmath69 is defined in ( [ wl_sources ] ) .",

    "the second term in the exponent is the leading term of the pt ( see ( [ glu1 ] ) ) .",
    "finally , it is easy to obtain a general @xmath4-dependence for the string tension @xmath111",
    "in this paper we calculated an effective model for the expectation value of the wilson loop in @xmath1 @xmath0 lgt at large values of @xmath59 .",
    "this model appears to be of a sine - gordon type and could be applied for all values of representations @xmath4 of @xmath0 group .",

    "we recover the result of the standard pt for the wilson loop ( perimeter law ) after integration over the fluctuations . in the abelian case",
    "our calculations support the result of @xcite that the string tension of @xmath3 lgt is proportional to @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath112 .",
    "as is well - known , the string tension of the wilson loops that are non - trivial on the center obeys ( [ string_tens_n - ality ] ) rather than ( [ abelianized_str_tens ] ) at the strong coupling , and it is commonly accepted that ( [ string_tens_n - ality ] ) represents true asymptotic behaviour at large @xmath59 as well .",

    "first of all , the result for @xmath113 string tension is qualitatively correct .",
    "it seems that our approach shows the expected @xmath63-ality dependence of the string tension .",

    ", the question arises how to account for the correct perimeter law decay of the wilson loop . both connectors and higher order terms in the @xmath114 expansion",
    "are presumably needed to achieve this .",
    "though our representation ( [ wilson_loop_su2 ] ) of the wilson loop is exact , it is clear that the summation over @xmath115 together with approximations used makes the whole theory equivalent to a set of @xmath116 abelian - like theories with abelian @xmath117-charge each .",
    "also it is not clear how to get the `` casimir scaling '' behaviour in this approach .",
    "our string tension has @xmath63-ality dependence for all distances .",
    "nevertheless ,  monopole contribution seems to be sufficient , if not necessary to get confinement .",
    "finally , consider small wilson loops . in this case to compute the string tension it is allowed to expand the cosine function in the effective model ( [ h_j ] ) . in the leading order and when @xmath118 and the size of the loop @xmath37 is fixed one obtains @xmath119 \\nonumber \\\\",

    "hence , the asymptotic of the exact solution reads @xmath144    to meet the condition ( [ cond_sphere_1 ] ) we take for the inner region ( @xmath145 ) the function @xmath146 which is a solution of ( [ omega_eq_case_gg_1 ] ) . combining solutions for two regions",

    "the diagram of the `` sandwich '' type is responsible for the first behaviour , while the second contribution is due to a planar diagram which covers the wilson loop in the representation @xmath4 .",
    "both types of diagrams exist in @xmath7 models as well and contribute to the expectation value of the wilson loop .",
    "the corresponding string tension behaves like in ( [ abelianized_str_tens ] ) , where one should take @xmath153 in the fundamental representation instead of @xmath154 . however , different types of diagrams define the behaviour of asymptotically large wilson loops in non - abelian models . for all representations",

    "it is easy to see the diagrams of this type could be constructed without connectors at all ( i.e. , with abelianized bianchi identity ) at least in the lowest order .",
    "so , in this case the contribution from connectors is trivial .",
    "however , one can not get the strong coupling diagram that represents @xmath63-ality dependence of the string tension without connectors .",
    "as example , consider the @xmath50 case .",
    "first , we construct `` tube '' from cubes in the fundamental representation ( see fig.([strong_coupl_diagram-2 ] ) ) and cover all outer plaquettes by plaquettes taken from the action .",
    "second , as is seen from formula ( [ wldual1 ] ) to get a nontrivial result of the invariant integration we need to cover all plaquettes from the surface by some plaquettes from additional bianchi identities in the representation @xmath50 .",
    "third , if we omit connectors from all bianchi identities we shall get a zero result due to integration over outer noncompensated plaquettes from these additional cubes . clearly , it is impossible to build such `` tube '' from plaquettes of abelianized bianchi identity .",
    "a result of the invariant integration would give a vanishing contribution in this case .",
    "thus , connectors appear to be a necessary element in constructing correct @xmath63-ality dependence .",
