    "the superfluid properties of the inner crust of neutron stars have been considered long ago in connection to the large relaxation times which follow the giant glitches .",

    "was also considered in relation to the cooling of isolated neutron stars  @xcite and , more recently , in the thermal after - burst relaxation of neutron stars from x - ray transients  @xcite .",
    "the superfluid properties of the inner crust are essentially determined by the non - localized neutrons . for baryonic densities smaller than about 1.4",
    "x 10@xmath0 g @xmath1 the non - localized neutrons are supposed to coexist with nuclei - type clusters  @xcite . at higher densities , before the nuclear matter becomes uniform , the neutrons and the protons can form other configurations such as rods , plates , tubes and bubbles  @xcite .",
    "a microscopic _ ab initio _ calculation of pairing in inner crust matter should take into account the polarization effects induced by the nuclear medium upon the bare nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "this is a very difficult task which is not yet completely solved even for the infinite neutron matter .",
    "thus , compared to bcs calculations with bare nucleon - nucleon forces , most of variational or diagrammatic models predict for infinite matter a substantial reduction of the pairing correlations due to the in - medium polarisation effects @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "calculations based on monte carlo techniques predict for dilute neutron matter results closer to the bcs calculations ( for a recent study see @xcite ) .    a consistent treatment of polarization effects on pairing is still missing for inner crust matter ( for a recent exploratory study see @xcite )",
    ". therefore at present the most advanced microscopic model applied to inner crust matter remains the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) approach .",
    "pairing correlations have been also considered in the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa)(see section 2.1 below ) in relation to the collective modes in inner crust matter @xcite . however , a systematic investigation of the effect of collective qrpa excitations on thermodynamic properties of inner crust matter is still missing .",
    "the scope of this chapter is to show how the hfb approach can be used to investigate the effects of pairing correlations on inner crust matter properties .",
    "hence , in the first part of the chapter we will discuss the influence of pairing , treated in hfb approach at zero temperature , on the structure of inner crust matter .",
    "then , using the hfb approach at finite temperature , we will show how the pairing correlations affect the specific heat and the thermalization of the inner crust matter in the case of a rapid cooling scenario .    in the present study we will focus only to the region of the inner crust which is supposed to be formed by a bbc crystal lattice of nuclear clusters embedded in non - localized neutrons .",
    "the crystal lattice is divided in elementary cells which are treated in the wigner - seitz approximation .",
    "in this section we discuss the finite - temperature hfb approximation for a wigner - seitz cell which contains in its center a nuclear cluster surrounded by a neutron gas .",
    "the cell contains also relativistic electrons which are considered uniformly distributed .    in principle , the hfb equations should be solved by respecting the bbc symmetry of the inner crust lattice . however , imposing the exact lattice symmetry in microscopic models is a very difficult task ( for approximative solutions to this problem see refs .",
    "@xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "we therefore solve the hfb equations for a spherical ws cell , as commonly done in inner crust studies @xcite .",

    "2 are shown the pairing fields for neutrons in the cells 2 and 5 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "it can be noticed that the clusters have a non - trivial influence on the pairing of neutron gas .",
    "thus , depending of the relative intensity of pairing in the cluster and the gas region , the presence of the cluster can suppress or enhance the pairing in the surface region of the cluster .",
    "pairing correlations affect not only the ground state properties of inner crust matter but also its excitations modes .",

    "it can be seen that the unperturbed spectrum , distributed over a large energy region , becomes concentrated almost entirely in the peak located at about 3 mev when the residual interaction between the quasiparticles is introduced .",
    "the peak collects more than 99@xmath60 of the total quadrupole strength and it is extremely collective .",
    "an indication of the extreme collectivity of this low - energy mode can be also seen from its reduced transition probability , b(e2 ) , which is equal to @xmath61 weisskopf units .",
    "this value of b(e2 ) is two orders of magnitude higher than in standard nuclei .",
