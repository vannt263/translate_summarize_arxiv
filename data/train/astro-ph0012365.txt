    "ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) with @xmath16 @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 discovered by the @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 ( iras ) are considered to be ideal laboratories for studying the formation of dusty starburst galaxies , elliptical galaxies , and qsos .",
    "detailed morphological studies of these ulirgs have revealed that virtually all show evidence of galaxy merging or strong tidal interaction ( e.g. , tidal tails and double or multiple nucleus ) and thus that most of ulirgs are formed by galaxy interaction / merging ( e.g. , sanders et al . 1988 ; clements et al . 1996 ; murphy et al . 1996 ; scoville et al . 1999 ; surace et al . 1999 ) .",
    "these ulirgs are observed to show mixtures of two types of activity ; starburst and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ( sanders et al 1988 ; sanders & mirabel 1996 ; veilleux , kim , & sanders 1999 ; zheng et al .",
    "it is still controversial whether dust - enshrouded agn or a nuclear dusty starburst is the primary energy source for the huge luminosity of ulirgs ( sanders & mirabel 1996 for a review ; genzel et al .",
    "1998 ; lutz et al . 1998 ; smith , lonsdale , & lonsdale 1998 ) .",
    "all of these of ulirgs are rich in molecular gas with the total mass of @xmath20 ranging from @xmath21 @xmath22 to 3 @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath22 ( sanders et al . 1988 ) , and a large fraction of this gas is in very dense regions near nuclei ( solomon et al .",
    "ulirgs appear to be about 2 times more numerous than optically selected qsos and the luminosity function of ulirgs is nearly similar to that of qsos ( soifer et al .",
    "these results give rise to the argument that quasar - like activity is also being initiated in major mergers and ulirgs can finally evolve into qsos ( sanders et al . 1988 ) .",
    "recent high - resolution optical / infrared imaging of ulirgs have revealed a number of very bright star - forming knots probably formed by merging processes and furthermore clarified diverse morphology reflecting their varying stages of galactic dynamical evolution ( scoville et al .",
    "1999 ; surace et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "these peculiar phenomena seen in ulirgs ( i.e. , ongoing major mergers ) have raised theoretical interests in the interstellar gas and star formation process in gas - rich major mergers with strong dusty starbursts .",
    "numerical simulations of galaxy mergers including gas dynamics indicate that a large amount of gas , as much as @xmath21 @xmath22 , can be funneled to the central kpc region of the remnant ( barnes & hernquist 1991 , 1992 ; olson & kwan 1990 ; noguchi 1991 ) .",
    "mihos et al .",
    "( 1992 ) suggested that the gas accumulated in the central kpc region of galaxy mergers can be converted into massive starburst , though the magnitude of the starburst is not strong enough to explain that observed in ulirgs . by using a more sophisticated model of hydrodynamical evolution of galaxy mergers , mihos & hernquist ( 1996 ) demonstrated that the strength and the epoch of massive starburst depend on initial internal structure of merger progenitor disks rather than initial orbital configurations of the disks .",
    "bekki & noguchi ( 1994 ) and bekki ( 1995 ) demonstrated that the dynamical heating by two sinking cores and subsequent dissipative cloud - cloud collisions in a merger can drive a large fraction of disk interstellar gas into the central tens pc where nuclear starburst and agn activity are observed for ulirgs .",
    "gerritsen & icke ( 1999 ) investigated how thermal energy from supernovae ( i.e. , feedback of supernovae ) affects the dynamical evolution of interstellar gas and consequently controls the star formation rate in a major merger and found that the supernovae energy from the nuclear high density gas region ( @xmath3 1 kpc ) can prevent the star formation in the outer region of the merger .",
    "although these theoretical studies have been quite successful in clarifying the detailed processes of gaseous inflow to the central 10 @xmath3 1000 pc and in describing star formation history for gas - rich major galaxy mergers , they have not yet investigated at all how photometric and spectroscopic properties of merger evolve with time .",
    "therefore it remains highly uncertain how the photometric properties of ulirgs is determined by the detailed dynamical processes of major galaxy merging .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to investigate numerically morphological , structural , and photometric evolution of gas - rich major mergers with dusty starburst in an explicitly self - consistent manner . by using a new numerical code for calculating the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of a galaxy with dusty interstellar gas ( bekki & shioya 2000a )",
    ", we particularly investigate the following five points : ( 1 ) the fundamental properties of seds of dusty starburst mergers with the infrared luminosity larger than @xmath7 @xmath5 , ( 2 ) time evolution of the relative spatial distribution of dusty gas and old and new stars , ( 3 ) the dependence of @xmath13 on stellar ages and radius from the center of mass of a merger , ( 4 ) time evolution of colors , absolute magnitude , surface brightness , dust temperature , and the degree of dust extinction ( @xmath13 ) , and ( 5 ) physical correlations between @xmath0 , central gas density , luminosity ratio ( e.g. , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the @xmath8 band luminosity ) , star formation efficiency , and morphology during starburst .",
    "the above points have not been investigated extensively by previous theoretical studies .",
    "accordingly , the present numerical results can provide new clues to the nature and the origin of ulirgs .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in  2 , we summarize numerical models used in the present study and describe briefly the methods for deriving the seds corrected by internal dust extinction . in  3 , we present numerical results on the time evolution of morphology , sed , and photometric properties in a gas - rich major merger . in  4 , we discuss the nature of ulirgs , in particular , the importance of the relative distribution of gas and stars in determining photometric and spectroscopic properties of ulirgs .",
    "the conclusions of the preset study are given in  5 .",
    "since numerical methods and technique for solving chemodynamical and photometric evolution of major galaxy mergers with dusty starburst have been already given in detail by bekki & shioya ( 2000a ) , we briefly describe the present merger model .",
    "we construct models of galaxy mergers between gas - rich disk galaxies with equal mass by using the fall - efstathiou ( 1980 ) model .",
    "the total mass and the size of a progenitor disk are @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively . from now on , all the mass and length are measured in units of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively , unless specified .",
    "velocity and time are measured in units of @xmath29 = @xmath30 and @xmath31 = @xmath32 , respectively , where @xmath33 is the gravitational constant and assumed to be 1.0 in the present study . if we adopt @xmath27 = 6.0 @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath34 and @xmath28 = 17.5 kpc as a fiducial value , then @xmath29 = 1.21 @xmath23 @xmath35 km / s and @xmath31 = 1.41 @xmath23 @xmath36 yr , respectively . in the present model ,",
    "the rotation curve becomes nearly flat at 0.35 radius with the maximum rotational velocity @xmath37 = 1.8 in our units .",
    "the corresponding total mass @xmath38 and halo mass @xmath39 are 5.0 and 4.0 in our units , respectively .",
    "the radial ( @xmath40 ) and vertical ( @xmath41 ) density profile of a disk are assumed to be proportional to @xmath42 with scale length @xmath43 = 0.2 and to @xmath44 with scale length @xmath45 = 0.04 in our units , respectively .",
    "the central bulge component is represented by a plummer sphere with the mass of 0.25 and the scale length of 0.04 in our units , which means that the mass ratio of bulge to disk is 0.25 and the scale length ratio of bulge to disk is 0.2 .",
    "the collisional and dissipative nature of the interstellar medium is modeled by the sticky particle method ( @xcite ) and the initial fraction of gas mass ( @xmath46 ) in a disk is set to be 0.2 .",
    "the number of particles for an above isolated galaxy is 10000 for dark halo , 3165 for stellar bulge , 10000 for stellar disk components , and 10000 for gaseous ones .    in all of the simulations of mergers ,",
    "the orbit of the two disks is set to be initially in the @xmath47 plane and the distance between the center of mass of the two disks ( @xmath48 ) is 140 kpc . the pericenter distance ( @xmath49 ) and the orbital eccentricity ( @xmath50 ) are assumed to be 17.5 kpc and 1 ( i.e. , parabolic ) , respectively .",
    "the spin of each galaxy in a merger is specified by two angle @xmath51 and @xmath52 , where suffix @xmath53 is used to identify each galaxy .",
    "@xmath51 is the angle between the @xmath54 axis and the vector of the angular momentum of a disk .",
    "@xmath52 is the azimuthal angle measured from @xmath55 axis to the projection of the angular momentum vector of a disk on to @xmath47 plane . in the present study",
    ", we show the results of only one model with @xmath56 = 30.0 , @xmath57 = @xmath58 , @xmath59 = 0.0 , @xmath60 = 0.0 : this model describes a nearly prograde - retrograde merger . the results of the models with variously different @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath48 will be described in our future papers ( bekki & shioya 2000c ) . the time when the progenitor disks merge completely and reach the dynamical equilibrium is less than 15.0 in our units for the present model ( @xmath3 2.12 gyr ) .",
    "star formation is modeled by converting the collisional gas particles into collisionless new stellar particles according to the schmidt law ( schmidt 1959 ) with exponent @xmath61 = 2.0 ( 1.0 @xmath62 @xmath61 @xmath62 2.0 , @xcite ) . chemical enrichment through star formation during galaxy merging is assumed to proceed both locally and instantaneously in the present study the fraction of gas returned to interstellar medium in each stellar particle and the chemical yield are 0.3 and 0.02 , respectively .",
    "initial metallicity @xmath63 for each stellar and gaseous particle in a given galactic radius @xmath40 ( kpc ) from the center of a disk is given according to the observed relation @xmath64 of typical late - type disk galaxies ( e.g. , zaritsky , kennicutt , & huchra 1994 ) .",
    "for calculating the sed that is not modified by dust extinction for a merger , we use the spectral library gissel96 which is the latest version of bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) . for deriving the sed modified by dust extinction , we use our original ray tracing method that can be applied to n - body simulations .",
    "the details of this method and advantages and disadvantages in using this method are given in bekki & shioya ( 2000a ) .",
    "all the calculations related to the above dynamical evolution including the dissipative dynamics , star formation , and gravitational interaction between collisionless and collisional component have been carried out on the grape board ( @xcite ) at astronomical institute of tohoku university .",
    "the parameter of gravitational softening is set to be fixed at 0.03 in all the simulations .",
    "the time integration of the equation of motion is performed by using 2-order leap - flog method .",
    "energy and angular momentum are conserved within 1 percent accuracy in a test collisionless merger simulation .",
    "based on the above numerical model , we investigate mainly the sed and the photometric evolution of major mergers and thereby provide some implications on the origin of ulirgs . before describing our numerical results , we should point out that total infrared luminosity ( @xmath0 ) of a major merger depends strongly on the initial disk mass of the merger .",
    "accordingly , the @xmath0 of a major merger during starburst can exceed @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 that is a defined value for ulirgs ( sanders & mirabel 1996 ) , only if the disk mass of the merger exceeds a certain value ( for a given orbital configuration and gas mass fraction in major merging ) .",
    "a possible dependence of @xmath0 on the initial disk mass of a major merger is described in detail in appendix a. in the present model with the initial disk mass of 6.0 @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath34 , the maximum @xmath0 is @xmath3 5.9 @xmath23 @xmath7 @xmath5 , which is appreciably smaller than the defined value of ulirgs .",
    "accordingly , the present merger model with structural and kinematical properties nearly the same as those of the milkey way does not show the evolution of ulirg in a strict sense .",
    "we however consider that it is not unreasonable for us to discuss extensively the origin and the nature of ulirgs by using the present model .",
    "this is because some changes of merger parameters ( e.g. , gas mass fraction , initial disk mass , and orbital configurations of mergers ) can increase the @xmath0 a factor of 2 and because the defined value of @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 itself does not probably have essentially important physical meanings .",
    "bekki & shioya ( 2000a ) have already demonstrated that if the gas mass fraction of initial disks of a merger is rather large ( 0.5 , which is an unrealistic value for the present disk galaxies but not so an unrealistic one for the high redshift dusty starburst galaxies such as faint submillimeter sources discovered by smail et al .",
    "1997 ) , the maximum infrared luminosity exceeds @xmath4 @xmath5 . in the present study",
    ", we described the model with @xmath65 = 0.2 and a nearly prograde - retrograde orbital configuration as a fiducial one showing a typical behavior of dusty major mergers that can form ulirgs .",
    "the essentially important results on photometric evolution of dusty starburst mergers do not depend so strongly on orbital configurations and internal structure in mergers , though the epoch and the strength of starbursts depend on these parameters .",
    "the dependence of photometric evolution on merger parameters will be described in our future papers ( bekki & shioya 2000c ) .",
    "figures 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 describe the time evolution of global morphology of the present merger model for each of three components , bulge , old disk , and gas disk ( and new stars ) .",
    "> from now on , for convenience , the time @xmath66 represents the time that has elapsed since the two disks begin to merge . seven fundamental properties of morphological evolution of the less inclined and nearly prograde - retrograde merger with bulges",
    "are described as follows .",
    "firstly , a strong stellar bar is not developed even in the disk orbiting in a prograde sense for the first encounter of the merger ( 0.56 @xmath67 @xmath66 @xmath67 0.85 gyr ) .",
    "this is because the central massive bulges of the two disks can prevent the growth of non - axisymmetric perturbation ( triggered by tidal interaction of the merger ) .",
    "secondly , as galaxy merging proceeds , the two disks are strongly disturbed to form a long tidal tail in the disk orbiting in a prograde sense at 0.56 @xmath67 @xmath66 @xmath67 0.71 gyr . a strong tidal tail is not developed in the disk orbiting in a retrograde sense .",
    "this one long tidal arm is characteristics of prograde - retrograde mergers .",
    "thirdly , the size of one disk orbiting in a prograde sense becomes smaller owing to the efficient tidal stripping of disk components whereas that of the other disk orbiting in a retrograde sense does not change so greatly for 1.12 @xmath67 @xmath66 @xmath67 1.48 gyr . as a natural result of this ,",
    "the major merger @xmath68 be observationally identified as a minor merger with the mass ratio of the two disks rather small ( @xmath69 @xmath67 0.1 ) or as unequal - mass one ( @xmath69 @xmath3 0.3 ) during violent interaction of the major merger ( corresponding to 1.12 @xmath67 @xmath66 @xmath67 1.48 gyr in the present study ) .",
    "fourthly , the tidal tail formed in the first encounter becomes less discernible when the two disks finally sink into the center of massive dark halos owing to dynamical friction during merging and consequently are completely destroyed by violent relaxation of galaxy merging ( 1.41 @xmath67 @xmath66 @xmath67 1.83 gyr ) .",
    "fifthly , an elliptical galaxy formed in the present very dissipative and less inclined merger model has a rather flattened shape .",
    "sixthly , old stellar components initially located within disks and bulges are more diffusely distributed than new stars in the merger remnant , primarily because new stars that were previously gaseous components experience much more amount of gaseous dissipation during merging .",
    "seventhly , these results are broadly consistent with those of previous dissipative merger models such as mihos & hernquist ( 1996 ) .    during violent major merging",
    ", interstellar gas is very efficiently transferred to the central region of the two disks owing to gaseous dissipation of colliding gas clouds and gravitational torque .",
    "gas accumulated in the central region of the merger is then consumed by massive starburst and consequently converted into new stars .",
    "figure 5 describes the total gas mass accumulated within the central 100 , 200 , and 500 pc for each of the merging disks . during the first tidal encounter of the merger ( 0.56 @xmath67 @xmath66 @xmath67 1.12 gyr ) , tidal force transforms the disk orbiting in a prograde sense more dramatically and",
    "furthermore changes the mass distribution of the disk .",
    "consequently angular momentum redistribution of gas and stars proceeds in the disk and some fraction of gas can be accumulated into the central region of the disk ( and some fraction of gas is tidally stripped away from the disk as a natural result of angular momentum redistribution ) . on the other hand",
    ", the disk orbiting in a retrograde sense does not suffer so severely from such tidal effects , and accordingly the mass distribution is not greatly changed for 0.56 @xmath67 @xmath66 @xmath67 1.12 gyr .",
    "thus , as is shown in figure 5 , total gas mass accumulated in the central region is larger for the disk orbiting in a prograde sense for 0.56 @xmath67 @xmath66 @xmath67 1.12 gyr . for the final violent relaxation phase ( 1.41 @xmath67 @xmath66 @xmath67 1.69 gyr ) ,",
    "the total gas mass is not so largely different and the gas mass is appreciably larger for the disk orbiting in a retrograde sense ( in particular , for the central 100 pc region ) .",
    "these results imply that the difference in the central gas mass between two disks in a merger can be more clearly observed in the merger early phase when two cores are still well separated ( i.e. , the epoch of early tidal encounter ) . as is shown in figure 6 , owing to the large central bulge",
    ", strong starbursts can occur only in the late phases of the merger when two disks are completely destroyed by violent relaxation to form the central high density core of an elliptical galaxy .",
    "the star formation rate becomes the maximum value of @xmath3 120 @xmath22 @xmath70 at @xmath66 = 1.53 gyr .",
    "the time scale within which the star formation rate exceeds 100 @xmath22 @xmath70 is rather short ( less than 0.1 gyr ) , which implies that the time scale for a gas - rich merger to become an ulirg is an order of 0.1 gyr .",
    "absorption of stellar light for stars in a galaxy can be modeled according to the following reddening formulation ( black 1987 ; mazzei et al .",
    "1992 ) ; @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are gaseous column density and gaseous metallicity , respectively .",
    "if we follow this reddening formulation , stellar light from a star is more strongly affected by dusty gas for the higher density and the larger metallicity of gas surrounding the star . accordingly estimating gas density and metallicity around each of stars in a galaxy is very important for deriving the total amount of dust extinction and thus the sed modified by dust extinction .",
    "thus we here show the time evolution of gaseous density and metallicity around stars before describing the time evolution of seds of the present merger model .",
    "figure 7 gives the time evolution of the mean value for gaseous density , metallicity , and the degree of dust extinction around new stars in the present merger model . in deriving the mean value for each time",
    "@xmath66 in this figure , we first find gaseous particles located within 0.02 ( in our units ; corresponding to 350 pc ) of each stellar particle and thereby estimate gaseous density and metallicity around each stellar particle .",
    "next we calculate the product of gaseous density and metallicity for each stellar particle ( this product is proportional to e(b - v ) in the above reddening formulation ) . for convenience",
    "we call this product as the degree of extinction in explaining figure 7 , 8 , 9 , and 10 . based on the above three values of each particle , we calculate the mean of these values at each time @xmath66 both for old stars initially located in disks and bulges and for new ones formed from gas .",
    "as is shown in figure 7 , both the mean gaseous density and the mean gaseous metallicity around stars are larger in new stars than in old ones . as a natural result of this ,",
    "the mean of the degree of extinction is considerably larger in new stars than in old ones during galaxy merging .",
    "the reason for these dependences is essentially that new stars are formed preferentially in the merger central region with very high density gas and are more compactly distributed within the central cores of the merger compared with old stars .",
    "these results accordingly suggest that seds from new stars are more dramatically modified by dust than those from old stars during dynamical evolution of the merger .",
    "furthermore the difference in the mean of the degree of dust extinction between new stars and old ones becomes larger during massive starburst ( 1.48 @xmath67 @xmath66 @xmath67 1.62 gyr ) , mainly because a large amount of gas is the most efficiently transferred to the nuclear regions where young stars are located .",
    "this result implies that since most of stellar light comes from young stellar components during starburst , the merger shows the largest degree of dust extinction during its starburst .",
    "figure 8 shows the age of each star and the gaseous metallicity around the star for all new stars at @xmath66 = 1.53 gyr corresponding to the epoch when the merger show the maximum star formation rate of @xmath74 @xmath22 @xmath75 . for a given stellar age , gaseous density , gaseous metallicity , the degree of extinction around stars",
    "are all very widely distributed , which reflect the fact that both chemical evolution and local density enhancement of gas proceed in a very inhomogeneous way during starburst of the merger .",
    "the number excess of stars around the age of 0 gyr in figure 8 is due mainly to the massive starburst around @xmath66 = 1.53 gyr .",
    "furthermore , a larger number of new stars are located in the region with larger dust extinction ( the upper parts in figure 8) for the age of @xmath3 0 gyr .",
    "figure 9 shows the radial dependence of gaseous density , gaseous metallicity , mean age of new stars ( estimated for each radial bin ) , and the mass fraction of new stars to all stars ( old stars and new ones ) at @xmath66 = 1.53 gyr ( the maximum starburst epoch ) .",
    "as is shown in this figure , both gaseous density and gaseous metallicity are likely to be higher and mean age of new stars is likely to be younger in the inner region of the merger .",
    "this suggests that stars with younger ages can be more heavily obscured by dust than those with older ages : the dust extinction is very selective in the sense that only very young components can be heavily obscured by dust .",
    "the selective dust extinction processes are described in detail in later sections .",
    "the fraction of new stars is likely to be larger in the inner region of the merger , which implies that the sed of the inner region of the merger is more strongly affected by dust extinction .",
    "figure 10 and 11 show clearly that the dust extinction can be very selective during starburst in the merger .",
    "figure 10 describes the dependence of mean gaseous density , mean gaseous metallicity , and mean of the degree of extinction around new stars on the mean age of new stars ( with ages smaller than 1.2 gyr ) at @xmath66 = 1.48 ( the beginning of starburst ) , 1.53 ( the maximum starburst ) , 1.55 , 1.62 , and 1.83 gyr ( the end of starburst ) .",
    "the top panel of figure 10 demonstrates that irrespectively of time @xmath66 , the mean gaseous density around new stars is likely to be larger for stars with younger ages and furthermore that the age dependence is more clearly seen for the epoch of stronger starburst ( @xmath66 = 1.53 and 1.55 gyr ) .",
    "for example , mean gas density for new stars with the ages ranging from 0 gyr to 0.06 gyr is about a factor of 5.5 times larger than that for new stars with the ages ranging from 1 gyr to 1.06 gyr at @xmath66 = 1.53 gyr .",
    "furthermore the middle panel of figure 10 indicates that although the mean gaseous metallicity around new stars is likely to be larger for new stars with younger ages , the age dependence is more clearly seen for the end of starburst ( @xmath66 = 1.83 gyr ) .",
    "the reason for the clearer age dependence of gaseous metallicity around new stars at @xmath66 = 1.83 gyr is that chemical evolution in the central region where young stellar components are located proceeds to a larger degree in the later phase of galaxy merging . as a result of the above age dependences ,",
    "the mean of the degree of dust extinction is likely to be larger for new stars with younger ages at all time @xmath66 ( 1.48 , 1.53 , 1.55 , 1.62 , and 1.83 gyr ) and the age dependence of the degree of extinction is clearer for the epoch of stronger starburst ( see the bottom panel in figure 10 ) .",
    "for example , the mean degree of dust extinction for new stars with the ages ranging from 0 gyr to 0.06 gyr is about a factor of 4.8 times larger than that for new stars with the ages ranging from 1 gyr to 1.06 gyr at @xmath66 = 1.53 gyr .",
    "the age - dependent dust extinction derived in figure 10 can be seen also in figure 11 for very young stars with the ages less than 0.12 gyr .",
    "these results in figure 10 and 11 thus demonstrate that dust extinction for young starburst components in major gas - rich mergers is very selective in the sense that stars with younger ages are more heavily obscured by dusty gas .",
    "this selective extinction is suggested to be crucially important for explaining spectroscopic properties of dusty starburst galaxies ( poggianti & wu 1999 ; shioya & bekki 2000 ) .",
    "we discuss this importance of selective dust extinction in the section of discussion (  4.2 ) .",
    "photometric evolution of dusty starburst galaxies is basically determined by the seds , and the seds furthermore depend on the age - metallicity distribution of stellar populations , the dust temperature ( represented by @xmath11 from now on ) , and the degree of dust extinction ( @xmath13 for extinction in @xmath76 band ) .",
    "therefore the time evolution of @xmath11 and @xmath13 is important for photometric evolution of dusty starburst galaxies , in particular , in infrared bands . in the present model , @xmath11",
    "is calculated for each of gaseous particles and @xmath13 can be estimated for each of the stellar ones ( bekki & shioya 2000a ) .",
    "the sed of a galaxy thus depends strongly on the detailed distribution of @xmath11 and @xmath13 .",
    "figure 12 shows the location of each of stellar particle ( with different ages ) on an age-@xmath13 plane at @xmath66 = 1.53 gyr .",
    "as is shown in this figure , the value of @xmath13 is rather diverse ; ranging from @xmath3 0.0 mag to @xmath3 300 mag for stars with ages larger than 5.0 @xmath23 @xmath77 yr .",
    "this result reflects the fact that gaseous density and metallicity around stars depend on the location of each star ( i.e. , whether a star is in the central high density region or in the outer low density one ) and are thus variously different between stars . for stars with the ages less than 5.0 @xmath23 @xmath77 yr",
    ", there is a tendency that younger stars have larger @xmath13 .",
    "this result thus confirms the selective dust extinction that is already described before in this paper .",
    "these young starburst populations are mostly located in the central high density gaseous region and @xmath13 of a new star is controlled greatly by the surrounding gaseous density .",
    "a new star with younger age ( @xmath67 5.0 @xmath23 @xmath77 yr ) , which is located in the rather inner part of the central starburst region , is more heavily obscured by high density gas in the central starburst region and consequently the @xmath13 of the star is larger .",
    "figure 13 shows the location of each of gaseous particles on @xmath78 plane , where @xmath41 is gaseous metallicity .",
    "we can discernibly observe a weak tendency that a more metal - enriched gas has a larger temperature ( in particular , for the metallicity range of @xmath41 @xmath67 0.02 ) , though the dispersion in @xmath11 distribution is rather large for a given @xmath41 .",
    "the main reason for this weak dependence is that a more metal - enriched gaseous particle is likely to be located in the central region where young massive stars emit a larger amount of stellar light that can be absorbed by dusty gas .",
    "the age dependence of @xmath13 and the metallicity dependence of @xmath11 derived in figure 12 and 13 can be seen at other @xmath66 during starburst ( bekki & shioya 2000c ) , which implies that such dependences are essential ingredients of dusty starburst major mergers .",
    "these dependences are furthermore important for ( mean ) @xmath13 and @xmath11 of the merger at each time @xmath66 .",

    "both @xmath13 and @xmath11 gradually increase with time and become maximum at the epoch of maximum starburst ( @xmath66 = 1.53 gyr ) .",
    "after starburst , @xmath13 rapidly decreases with time , mainly because gaseous density around new stars becomes considerably smaller owing to rapid consumption of gas by starburst ( see also figure 7 ) .",
    "@xmath11 also becomes low after starburst because most of young massive stars emitting a large amount of stellar light ( that can be absorbed by dusty gas ) died out .",
    "the time evolution of the sed and the shape of the sed in the present merger model depends strongly on the time evolution of @xmath13 and @xmath11 .",

    "the infrared and submillimeter luminosities become larger during 1.41 @xmath67 @xmath66 @xmath67 1.53 gyr in the present merger .",
    "this is firstly because star formation rate , which is closely associated with the total amount of stellar light absorbed by interstellar dust , becomes considerable higher owing to the efficient gas transfer to the central region of the merger and secondly because the density of dusty gas becomes also very high in the later phase of the merging ( 1.41 @xmath67 @xmath66 @xmath67 1.53 gyr ) so that the gas can heavily obscure the strong starburst . after the maximum starburst at @xmath66 = 1.53 gyr , both infrared and submillimeter luminosities rapidly decline ( 1.53 @xmath67 @xmath66 @xmath67 1.83 gyr )",
    "this is principally because most of interstellar gas indispensable for strong starburst and dust obscuration is rapidly consumed by star formation in the merger till @xmath66 @xmath3 1.83 gyr .",
    "thus the time evolution of sed of a merger depends strongly on that of the star formation rate , which is basically controlled by the dynamical evolution of the merger .",
    "figure 16 describes the sed of the merger for old stars , new ones , and gas at the maximum starburst ( @xmath66 = 1.53 gyr ) in models with and without dust extinction .",
    "one of advantages of the present numerical model is that we can investigate the sed of each of stellar particles and the dust reemission from each of gaseous one .",
    "although stellar light from new stars dominates the sed in @xmath79 band ( @xmath80 0.3 @xmath81 ) for the model without dust extinction , the difference in the @xmath79 flux between the two stellar populations is appreciably smaller for the model with dust extinction .",
    "this is mainly because new stars are located in the central region , where there is a large amount of high density gas , and consequently are more heavily obscured by dust than old ones ( see also figure 8) . on the other hand ,",
    "the contribution of old stars to the sed in optical and near - infrared bands is appreciably larger compared with that of new stars in the model with dust extinction , though the shape of the sed at optical and near - infrared bands is not significantly different between new stars and old ones in the model without dust extinction .",
    "this result suggests that photometric properties of dusty starburst mergers ( i.e. , luminous infrared galaxies , lirgs and ulirgs ) in optical and near - infrared band are determined largely by old stellar populations ( old stars ) owing to selective dust extinction of new stars .",

    "firstly we summarize the evolution of the model without dust extinction . owing to the aging of old stellar populations , the absolute magnitude of the merger in most of bands",
    "becomes fainter as galaxy merging proceeds .",
    "the absolute magnitude in @xmath82 band is very sensitive to star formation rate and therefore appreciably brightens at @xmath66 @xmath3 0.85 gyr when the two disks in the merger first encounter and consequently weak starburst occurs in the disk rotating in a prograde sense . during strong starburst ( 1.4 @xmath67 @xmath66 @xmath67 1.6 gyr )",
    ", the absolute magnitude of the merger rapidly brightens with time because of increased stellar light from young massive stars .",
    "furthermore , the increase of luminosity depends on wavelength such that the magnitude difference between the epoch of prestarburst ( @xmath66 @xmath67 1.4 gyr ) and that of starburst is larger for shorter wavelength ( e.g. , @xmath3 1.7 mag for @xmath82 band and @xmath3 0.5 mag for @xmath84 one ) . the @xmath84 band absolute magnitude during starburst becomes brighter than @xmath851 that is the mean value of ulirgs ( sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .",
    "the absolute magnitude of the merger rapidly becomes faint with time after starburst because of the death of young massive stars .",
    "the difference in absolute magnitude between starburst and poststarburst is also larger for shorter wavelength .",
    "next we summarize the evolution of the model with dust extinction .",
    "as is shown in figure 17 , the time evolution of the absolute magnitude of the merger ( 0 @xmath80 @xmath66 @xmath80 2.3 gyr ) becomes rather moderate compared with the model without dust extinction for all bands , though the time evolution is qualitatively similar to that of the model without dust extinction .",
    "this is principally because young massive stars , which are important factor for the rapid increase and decrease in photometric properties of major mergers , are heavily obscured by dusty gas .",
    "the difference in absolute magnitude between the two models with and without dust extinction is larger for shorter wavelength during starburst , which reflect the fact that stellar light with shorter wavelength can be more greatly absorbed by dust .",
    "furthermore , irrespectively of wavelength , the difference in absolute magnitude between the two models is likely to be the largest at the epoch of maximum starburst ( @xmath66 = 1.53 gyr ) .",
    "this is because young and very luminous components formed by starburst are the most heavily obscured by dust at the maximum starburst epoch when a large amount of dusty gas is transferred to the central region to form very high density region around the compact starburst .",
    "the @xmath84 band magnitude at @xmath66 = 1.53 gyr is about @xmath86 mag that is about 0.9 mag fainter ( less luminous ) than the mean @xmath84 band magnitude of ulirgs ( sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .",
    "this is either because the initial total mass of the host disk of a typical ulirg is about 2 times larger than that of the galaxy adopted as a merger progenitor disk in the preset study or because the present model underestimates the star formation rate of the merger ( e.g. , owing to the smaller initial gas mass fraction ) .",
    "figure 18 describes the time evolution of global colors from optical to near - infrared wavelength ( in @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath14 ) for the models with and without dust extinction . by comparing the results of the model with dust extinction with those of the model without dust extinction",
    ", we can clearly observe that the effect of dust on color evolution is basically similar to that on the above evolution of absolute magnitude : the time variation of colors during galaxy merging becomes rather moderate owing to dust extinction . to be more specific ,",
    "although the @xmath87 color becomes @xmath3 0.4 mag bluer in the maximum starburst ( @xmath66 = 1.53 gyr ) than in the prestarburst ( @xmath66 = 1.4 gyr ) for the model without dust extinction , the color difference between the two epochs is only 0.04 mag for the model with dust extinction .",
    "this result implies that a major merger does not necessarily show very blue colors when it becomes a lirg ( or an ulirg ) owing to very strong dust extinction .",
    "we here point out that the color evolution derived above is based only on the present model with a certain orbital configuration .",
    "we accordingly suggest that although the derived essential dust effects on color evolution could be true for lirgs and ulirgs , the @xmath90 @xmath91 of the colors of lirgs and ulirgs can depend on orbital configurations and internal structure of galaxy mergers .",
    "bekki & shioya ( 2000b ) found that a nearly retrograde - retrograde merger suffers the more remarkable dust extinction of stellar light than a prograde - prograde merger .",
    "since the colors of mergers depend also on the degree of dust extinction , lirgs and ulirgs formed by mergers with variously different orbital configurations and internal structure probably show different colors .",
    "figure 19 shows the time evolution of mid - infrared and far - infrared fluxes at 25 @xmath2 m , 60 @xmath2 m , and 100 @xmath2 m of the merger , that of the ratio of 25 @xmath2 m flux to 60 @xmath2 m one ( @xmath92 ) , and that of the ratio of 60 @xmath2 m flux to 100 @xmath2 m one ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the present model does not include the effects of small grains on seds and accordingly can not so precisely estimate the infrared flux around the order of 10 @xmath2 m . here",
    "we thus point out that although the following evolution of the fluxes could be qualitatively similar to the evolution observed in lirgs and ulirgs , the absolute values of the fluxes can be largely different from observational ones .",
    "the 25 @xmath2 m , 60 @xmath2 m , and 100 @xmath2 m fluxes are rather sensitive to star formation rate and dust temperature and therefore depend strongly on star formation histories and the degree of central gas concentration in major mergers .",
    "the first remarkable increase of the fluxes ( in particular , for 25 @xmath2 m and 60 @xmath2 m ) corresponds to the epoch of the first encounter of two disks of the merger ( @xmath66 = 0.85 gyr ) .",
    "the second and the largest increase at @xmath66 = 1.53 gyr is due to the maximum starburst heavily obscured by dusty gas .",
    "the increase of these fluxes is associated closely with the increase of dust temperature and the fraction of young stars obscured by dust . as is shown in figure 19 ,",
    "the flux ratio of @xmath12 becomes considerably larger ( @xmath3 0.4 ) during starburst compared with the initial value ( @xmath3 0.04 ) .",
    "this result implies that mergers in the merger late phase when two cores become very close ( less than a few kpc ) are more likely to show larger @xmath12 .",
    "the time evolution of the flux ratio of @xmath92 is rather moderate and furthermore the values of @xmath92 is less than 0.02 during merging .",
    "the derived value is much smaller than that of the so - called warm ulirgs which are observationally suggested to have agns ( e.g. , sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .",
    "thus our present study , which does not include the effects of small grains though , confirms that dusty starburst alone can not contribute to the large flux ratio of @xmath92 observed in warm ulirgs .",
    "figure 20 gives the time evolution of @xmath0 and @xmath10 in the present merger model .",
    "both @xmath0 and @xmath10 become considerably larger during strong starburst , because a larger number of young stars are created and then obscured by dusty gas during starburst .",
    "although the change of @xmath8 band magnitude is at most 0.3 mag during starburst ( see figure 17 ) , that of @xmath0 is @xmath3 an order of magnitude .",
    "this result indicates that major mergers with similar luminosities can show very different @xmath0 and furthermore that @xmath0 reflects the dynamical stages of major galaxy merging .",
    "furthermore the @xmath10 during starburst becomes larger than 10 that is similar to the order of @xmath10 of lirgs and ulirgs .",
    "this result confirms that the rather large luminosity ratio of @xmath10 observed in lirgs and ulirgs are associated closely with major galaxy merging .",
    "considering the results shown in figure 19 and 20 , we can say that a merger with higher @xmath10 shows warmer @xmath12 and also that @xmath12 increases with the increase of @xmath0 .",
    "these derived correlations are consistent reasonably well with the observational ones ( e.g. , sandered & mirabel 1996 ) .",
    "figure 21 shows the two - dimensional distribution ( projected onto the @xmath55-@xmath93 plane ) of @xmath84 band surface brightness , @xmath14 color , 60 @xmath2 m flux , and @xmath13 at the epoch of maximum starburst ( @xmath66 = 1.53 gyr ) . the @xmath84 band surface brightness is higher in the inner region of the merger and shows peculiar double - peak morphology in the central region .",
    "the main reason for this central peculiar morphology is that the merger at this epoch has non - axisymmetric structure ( composed both old stars and new ones ) formed by dynamical relaxation of major merging .",
    "the difference in @xmath84 band surface brightness between the central region ( @xmath3 2 kpc ) and the outer one ( @xmath3 8kpc ) is about 7 mag @xmath94 at this epoch .",
    "the distribution of @xmath14 color is more complicated and more strongly disturbed than that of @xmath84 band surface brightness , which implies that the signature of major galaxy merging can be more clearly observed in the @xmath14 color distribution than the @xmath84 band surface brightness distribution .",
    "the reason for this peculiar morphology of color distribution is that stellar light in @xmath40 band ( rather than in @xmath84 band ) is strongly affected by dusty gas that is distributed in a very irregular way owing to dynamical perturbation of the merger .",
    "the merger at the very luminous infrared phase shows the redder color in the central region than in the outer region , which means that ulirgs and lirgs are more likely to have negative color gradients .",
    "the reasons for the derived negative gradient are ( 1 ) that the central starburst components are rather heavily obscured by dust and ( 2 ) that initially the central stellar components are more metal - rich owing to the bulge components .",
    "the absolute magnitude of the negative @xmath14 color gradient is estimated to be 0.08 mag / kpc for the central 8.5 kpc of the merger at this epoch .    as is shown in figure 21 ,",
    "the infrared flux at 60 @xmath2 m is distributed rather preferentially to the central region of the merger .",
    "the peak of the 60 @xmath2 m flux coincides both with the peak of the @xmath13 distribution and with the ( lower ) peak of the @xmath84 band surface brightness one .",
    "this result means that the infrared emission from dusty gas comes exclusively from the central compact high density gaseous regions where very young starburst components are located .",
    "the coincidence of the two peaks ( in @xmath84 band surface brightness and @xmath13 ) is furthermore associated with the origin of peculiar morphology of @xmath84 band surface brightness distribution .",
    "the distribution of @xmath13 is also very compact and shows the rather large negative radial gradient ( @xmath3 3.0 mag / kpc for the central 2 kpc ) . figure 21 furthermore shows that the @xmath14 color distribution is more similar to the @xmath13 one than the @xmath84 band surface brightness one .",
    "this implies that the two - dimensional distributions of dust extinction in luminous infrared galaxies formed by major mergers are important not only for the infrared luminosity distribution but also for the color distribution .",
    "lirgs and ulirgs are observed to show a number of fundamental correlations between physical properties such as @xmath0 , @xmath10 , infrared colors ( e.g. , @xmath95 ) , star formation efficiency estimated from the ratio of @xmath0 to @xmath96 molecular gas , and core separation of two merging disks ( sanders & mirabel 1996 ; gao & solomon 1999 ; young 1999 ) .",

    ", we initially place a stellar ( collisionless ) particle in the center of mass of each disk and thereby investigate the orbit of each particle . by measuring the separation of the two particles at each time step , we estimate the core separation ( @xmath40 ) of the merger . as is shown in figure 22 , total gas mass within the central 500 pc",
    "is more likely to be smaller for the smaller core separation .",
    "the decrease of gas mass with the increase of the core separation for 0.0 @xmath67 @xmath97 @xmath67 0.5 in our units ( corresponding to 0.56 @xmath67 @xmath66 @xmath67 0.99 gyr ) reflects the fact that the two disks separate from with each other after the first encounter of the disks and before final coalescence .",
    "the reason of the decrease of gas mass with the decrease of core separation ( in particular for 0.5 @xmath67 @xmath97 @xmath67 @xmath98 in figure 22 ) is simply that as the major merging proceeds , a larger amount of gas within the central 500 pc is consumed by star formation .",
    "gao & solomon ( 1999 ) found a correlation between the co ( 1 - 0 ) luminosity corresponding to a measure of molecular mass @xmath99 and the projected separation of merger nuclei ( the indicator of merging stages ) in a sample of 50 lirg mergers . since most of interstellar gas with rather high gaseous density",
    "is observationally demonstrated to become @xmath96 gas , we consider that it is reasonable to compare the present results on gaseous distribution with the observational ones on @xmath96 gaseous distribution .",
    "thus , although the present study does not investigate the time evolution of @xmath99 gas mass , it is not unreasonable for us to say the present numerical model at least quantitatively reproduces the observed correlation .",

    "the star formation efficiency estimated from the ratio of star formation rate ( @xmath100 ) to total gas mass within the central 500 pc is larger for the smaller core separation for @xmath101 @xmath6 @xmath102 ( corresponding to @xmath66 @xmath67 1.53 gyr , i.e. , before the epoch of maximum starburst ) .",
    "the reason of this derived dependence is that owing to the adopted density - dependent star formation rate ( i.e. , the schmidt law ) , the star formation efficiency becomes larger when the two cores approach with each other and the degree of the central gas accumulation becomes larger . after the maximum starburst ,",
    "the star formation efficiency rapidly declines with time and thus with the core separation ( @xmath66 @xmath6 1.53 gyr ) , which means that there is no remarkable positive correlation between core separation and star formation efficiency for mergers after massive starburst .",
    "gao & solomon ( 1999 ) also found an anti - correlation between @xmath103 corresponding to a global measure of the star formation rate per unit gas mass and the projected separation of merging two cores in lirgs .",
    "our results successfully reproduce this observed dependence , in particular , for the strong starburst epoch that can be interpreted as a lirg phase .",
    "we suggest that the observed correlation can be also understood in terms of gas accumulation processes of major galaxy mergers . here",

    "thus more quantitative comparison of our theoretical results with observations ( e.g. , those by gao & solomon 1999 ) requires high - resolution numerical simulations that can derive the time evolution of @xmath96 mass ( e.g. , transformation from hi gas to @xmath96 one ) and that of spatial distribution of @xmath96 gas .",
    "we plan a future study to include the formation of molecular gas ( @xmath96 ) from atomic one ( hi ) in numerical simulations and thereby to investigate time evolution of @xmath96 mass and spatial distribution of @xmath96 .",
    "the luminosity ratio of @xmath10 , the flux ratio of @xmath12 , and the degree of dust extinction ( @xmath13 ) are likely to be larger for the smaller core separation .",
    "the essential reason for the dependence of @xmath10 is that stellar light in @xmath8 band of young stellar populations is more heavily absorbed by dusty gas and reemitted in the infrared band and consequently becomes smaller for the smaller core separation .",
    "the main reason for the dependence of @xmath12 is that the dust temperature is likely to increase with the decrease of core separation .",
    "the reason for the dependence of @xmath13 is that the degree of the central gaseous accumulation becomes larger as major merging ( and dynamical relaxation ) proceeds .",
    "we accordingly suggest that @xmath10 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 observed in lirgs and ulirgs clearly depend on to what degree galaxy mergers are dynamically relaxed .",
    "we also suggest that the diversity of @xmath10 observed in lirgs and ulirgs ( e.g. , sanders & mirabel 1996 ) can be understood in terms of the difference in merging stages ( or in the degree of dynamical relaxation ) .",
    "figure 22 furthermore indicates that although the total mass of stellar components in the merger does not increase significantly during galaxy merging ( only a factor of 0.15 increase ) , there is an order of magnitude difference in @xmath10 between the merger at different dynamical stages .",

    "accordingly , the diversity in initial physical conditions of galaxy merging ( e.g. , gas mass fraction and orbital configurations ) could furthermore cause considerably greater difference in @xmath10 and @xmath12 .",

    "it is generally considered that investigating theoretically the time evolution of dusty starburst galaxies is important for better understanding the nature and the origin of ulirgs .",
    "it is particularly important to investigate spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of dusty starburst galaxies , primarily because galactic seds are considered to be one of essentially important factors that can determine the nature of dusty starburst galaxies .",
    "the following previous theoretical studies have succeeded in clarifying important dependences of seds on physical parameters such as spatial distribution of dust , geometries of stellar and gaseous components , and dust properties in dusty starburst galaxies .",
    "witt et al . ( 1991 ) investigated transfer processes of stellar light for models with variously different spherical geometries of dust with special emphasis on the effects of scattered light on photometric properties of galaxies and seds .",
    "witt & gordon ( 1996 ) investigated the radiative transfer processes of a central stellar source surrounded by a spherical , statistically homogeneous but clumpy two - phase scattering medium and found that the structure of dusty medium can greatly affect the conversion of uv , optical , and near - infrared radiation into thermal far - ir dust radiation in a dusty system . by comparing the observed seds of 30 starburst galaxies with theoretical radiative transfer models of dusty systems , gordon , calzetti , & witt ( 1997 ) discussed the importance of geometry of stellar and gaseous components in determining the sed of a dusty starburst galaxy .",
    "we here suggest that among the important factors for galactic seds , the relative spatial distribution of gas and stars is a particularly important determinant for the evolution of seds and thus for the photometric evolution in dusty starburst galaxies . in particular",
    ", we stress that the relative spatial distribution of dusty interstellar gas and young stars ( i.e. , starburst populations ) is critically important , because most of stellar light during starburst comes from young starburst components in galaxies . as is demonstrated in the present study , photometric evolution such as the time evolution of @xmath14 color , @xmath0 , @xmath108 and @xmath10 , clearly reflects the time evolution of the spatial distribution of dusty gas and young stars .",
    "the difference in the relative distribution of gas and young stars is also suggested to explain the diversity in seds and @xmath10 observed in ulirgs ( bekki & shioya 2000b , c ) .",
    "then can we observationally confirm the suggested importance of the relative distribution of gas and young stars in photometric evolution of ulirgs ?",
    "recent high - resolution observational studies on hi and @xmath96 gaseous distribution have already revealed the detailed spatial distribution of interstellar gas ( e.g. , hibbard & yun 1999 ) .",
    "accordingly it will be possible for us to answer the above question if ongoing and future observational studies can derive the detailed spatial distribution of star - forming regions and thus that of young stellar populations for a starburst galaxy consisting both of old and young stars .",
    "based on the keck spectra for each of the projected region of 3c48 ( which is a qso at @xmath54 = 0.38 and also identified as an ulirg with dusty starburst ) , canalizo & stockton ( 1999 ) examined the nature of stellar populations for each of the regions and thereby derived spatial distribution of young stellar population for 3c48 .",
    "however , there are only a few observational studies which investigate in detail the two - dimensional distribution of spectroscopic properties and address the projected distribution of young stellar populations for dusty galaxies .",
    "young starburst populations are suggested to be relatively correctly traced by the spatial distribution of h@xmath109 regions without being affected seriously by dust extinction ( kennicutt 1998 ) .",

    "accordingly we expect that future ( and ongoing ) systematic spectroscopic studies with integral - field spectroscopy ( for spatial distribution of star - forming regions ) combined with very high - resolution mapping of dusty interstellar gas will assess the validity of the suggested importance of the relative distribution of gas and young stars .",
    "recently poggianti & wu ( 1999 ) have investigated in detail spectroscopic properties of ulirgs and found that some ulirgs show both strong balmer absorption and relatively modest [ oii ] emission ( the so - called e(a ) spectra ) .",

    "1999 ; smail et al .",
    "1999 ) , which implies that this spectra is not characteristic only for ulirgs .",
    "poggianti et al .",
    "( 1999 ) suggested that this e(a ) spectra comes from the starburst regions obscured by dust .",
    "although a growing number of observational results on e(a ) galaxies with possible dusty starburst have been accumulated , there are only a few theoretical studies addressing the formation and the evolution of these e(a ) populations",
    ". poggianti & wu ( 1999 ) first discussed that if the dust extinction for a stellar population decreases with the stellar age , e(a ) spectra can be obtained for a starburst galaxy .",
    "they furthermore suggested that if the location and thickness of dust patches depend on the age of the embedded stellar populations in a starburst galaxy , the effects of the above selective dust extinction become remarkable for the galaxy . based on a one - zone chemophotometric evolution model of dusty starburst galaxies ,",
    "shioya & bekki ( 2000 ) confirmed that if a young starburst population is preferentially obscured by dust than old one in a dusty starburst galaxy , the galaxy shows e(a ) spectra .",
    "then , when and how the proposed difference in the degree of dust extinction between stellar populations with different ages is possible during galaxy merging ?",
    "we here suggest that the difference of dust extinction between the central region and the outer one in a galaxy is a main cause for the above age - dependent extinction .",
    "to be more specific , since younger stellar populations formed by secondary starburst in the central region with a larger amount of dust interstellar gas are more heavily obscured by dust than the outer old components , the age - dependent extinction can be achieved in mergers .",
    "this radial dependence of dust extinction is considerably reasonable and realistic , considering that secondary dusty starburst occurs preferentially in the central part of a galaxy owing to efficient inward gas transfer driven by non - axisymmetric structure ( such as stellar bars ) during galaxy merging . the present numerical simulations on gaseous and stellar distribution in merging disk galaxies with dusty starburst furthermore have demonstrated that the central young stellar component formed by nuclear starburst is more heavily obscured by dusty gas than the outer old component initially located in merger progenitor disks .",
    "we accordingly suggest that galaxies with the central dusty starburst ( e.g. , ulirgs ) are more likely to show the selective dust extinction and thus have spectroscopic properties characteristic for e(a ) galaxies .",
    "although we have not yet investigated spectroscopic properties of ulirgs formed by major merging in detail , it is not unreasonable to claim that the e(a ) spectral appearance is due essentially to the selective dust extinction ( i.e. , age - dependent extinction ) in the central regions of gas - rich major mergers with strong dusty starburst . in our preliminary studies ( bekki & shioya 2000c )",
    ", a dusty starburst merger shows k+a / a+k spectra ( i.e. , the classical `` e+a '' galaxy ) at the epoch of post - starburst and e(a ) spectra at the epoch of maximum starburst .",
    "we have investigated in detail morphological , structural , and photometric evolution of gas - rich major mergers with strong dusty starburst in an explicitly self - consistent manner in order to explore the nature of ulirgs .",
    "main conclusions are summarized as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) a massive starburst triggered by dynamical processes of major galaxy merging is found to be very heavily obscured by high density , dusty gas in a gas - rich merger . as a result of this , the merger can become a very luminous infrared galaxy with @xmath0 of @xmath3 5.9 @xmath23 @xmath7 @xmath5 at the maximum starburst epoch which corresponds to the epoch of the formation of central high density core of an elliptical galaxy .",
    "\\(2 ) dust extinction of stellar populations in a galaxy merger with large infrared luminosity ( @xmath0 @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath5 ) is selective in the sense that younger stellar populations are preferentially obscured by dust than old ones .",
    "this is because younger populations are located in the central region where a larger amount of dusty interstellar gas can be transferred from the outer gas - rich regions in the merger .",
    "this selective extinction provides physical basis for the origin of spectroscopic properties of ulirgs , such as e(a ) spectra recently revealed by poggianti & wu ( 1999 ) .",
    "\\(3 ) both @xmath0 and @xmath10 increase as the star formation rate increases during starburst of the present merger model , resulting in the positive correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath10 in the merger model .",
    "the time evolution of the relative distribution of dusty gas and young starburst components is crucially important for the time evolution of these properties .",
    "\\(4 ) the dust temperature @xmath110 and the flux ratio of @xmath12 increase with the increase of the star formation rate . this is because a larger number of young stars formed by massive starburst can heat the dusty interstellar gas as the star formation rate becomes higher .",
    "\\(5 ) global colors ( e.g. , @xmath14 ) are redder in the central region than in the outer one at the epoch of strong starburst in a dusty major merger , which implies that most ulirgs show negative color gradients .",
    "furthermore the central surface brightness ( e.g. , in @xmath84 band ) becomes higher as the star formation rate becomes larger during starburst primarily because both old and young stellar populations are more strongly concentrated in the nuclear region of the merger .",
    "two - dimensional color distributions seem to be more strongly disturbed than surface brightness maps .",
    "the peak of two dimensional distribution of @xmath15 flux coincides with that of @xmath13 .",
    "these results clearly suggest that spatial distribution of gas and stars is one of important determinants for the two - dimensional photometric properties of major mergers .",
    "\\(6 ) the star formation efficiency in a major merger becomes higher as the separation of the two cores becomes smaller , which clearly reflects the fact that dynamical processes of galaxy merging play an important role in determining the time evolution of dusty starburst in the merger ( e.g. , the time evolution of chemical components and local gaseous density in the starburst regions ) .",
    "total gas mass , the degree of dust extinction ( @xmath13 ) , @xmath11 , @xmath0 , @xmath10 , and @xmath12 also depend strongly on the separation of two cores of the merger .",
    "\\(7 ) the star formation efficiency during starburst in a merger is found to correlate positively with the flux ratio of @xmath12 , which is consistent with recent observational results by young ( 1999 ) .",
    "furthermore @xmath10 and @xmath12 are found to be proportional to @xmath0 and to the central gaseous density of the merger , which is also consistent with fundamental properties observed in ulirgs ( e.g. , sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .",
    "we lastly stress that better understanding of dissipative and dissipationless dynamics of galaxy merging furthermore leads us to clarify more thoroughly the photometric properties of ulirgs .",
    "we are grateful to the referee guy worthey for valuable comments , which contribute to improve the present paper",
    "thanks the japan society for promotion of science ( jsps ) research fellowships for young scientists .",
    "the expected mass ( luminosity ) dependence of @xmath0 is described as follows .",
    "the @xmath0 is observationally suggested to be proportional to star formation rate ( kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "therefore , the mass dependence of @xmath0 depends on the mass dependence of ( maximum ) star formation rate . here",
    "we define the maximum value of @xmath0 derived in the present study as @xmath111 .",
    "based on @xmath111 for the model with the mass of the merger progenitor disk equal to 6.0 @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath34 , we predict the @xmath112 for mergers with different @xmath113 , where @xmath113 is the initial total mass of a disk in a merger .",
    "we also define the total mass of luminous and dark matter and size of the progenitor as @xmath114 and @xmath115 , respectively .",
    "we consider here that gas mass in a disk is proportional to @xmath116 for simplicity .",
    "the dynamical time scale represented by @xmath117 is given as @xmath118 assuming the freeman s law and the constant ratio of @xmath115 to the scale length of exponential disk , we derive @xmath119 we assume that the degree of self - gravity of a galactic disk is described as @xmath120 where @xmath121 is a parameter that controls the degree of self - gravitating of the disk and should be determined by observational studies .",
    "@xmath112 is proportional to star formation rate and thus can be scaled to @xmath122 ( in our units )",
    ". then we can derive @xmath123 if we assume that @xmath121 is 0 ( 0 @xmath80 @xmath121 @xmath80 0.6 , saglia 1996 ) , this relationship predicts that @xmath112 becomes larger as @xmath116 increases . by using the derived value of 5.9 @xmath23 @xmath7 @xmath124 for @xmath125 , we can expect the following @xmath116 dependence of @xmath112 , @xmath126 the expected mass dependences of @xmath0 for the cases of @xmath121 = 0.0 and 0.6 are shown in figure 24 .",
    "in this paper , we show the results of only one merger model with a prograde - retrograde configuration .",
    "figure 25 shows clearly this orbital configuration of merging two disk galaxies .",
    "stellar and gaseous particles in the galaxy labeled as galaxy 1 orbit the center of the galaxy in a counter - clockwise whereas the galaxy itself orbits the center of mass of the merger in a counter - clockwise .",
    "this galaxy is considered to be rotating in a prograde sense for the merger , because intrinsic spin vector of the galaxy is nearly the same as that of the orbital one . in the galaxy labeled as galaxy 2 , on the other hand , stellar and gaseous components orbit the center of the galaxy in a clockwise whereas the galaxy itself orbits the center of mass of the merger in a counter - clockwise .",
    "this galaxy is considered to be rotating in a retrograde sense because intrinsic spin of the galaxy goes in the opposite direction of the orbital one .",
    "the merger with this orbital configuration is referred to as a nearly prograde - retrograde merger in the present paper ."
