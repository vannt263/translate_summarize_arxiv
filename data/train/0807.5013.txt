    "pulsars are highly magnetized , rotating neutron stars which emit beams of radio emission at a low height above the star s magnetic poles .",
    "the emission is confined to the open field lines and the beam only sweeps out a small fraction of the celestial sphere .",
    "for this reason we see emission from only one pole in the vast majority of pulsars . in fortunate geometrical circumstances ,",
    "however , the second pole should also be observable as a radio emitting site , if the spin axis is almost orthogonally orientated to the line - of - sight to earth .",
    "such pulsars can be identified by the detection of an `` interpulse '' separated by @xmath3 in pulse longitude from the main pulse .",
    "less than 30 pulsars have been identified to show interpulses @xcite from the known population of @xmath21800 pulsars .",
    "not all interpulses may arise from the second magnetic pole , but some of them can also be interpreted within a geometry of an aligned rotator where the observer s line - of - sight never , or hardly , leaves the emission cone during the pulse period ( e.g.  manchester & lyne 1977 ) .",
    "the geometry of a pulsar may be determined from observations of their polarization which has been a major industry since shortly after their discovery . in the more than 40 years since ,",
    "a few key points are well established ( see e.g.  lorimer & kramer 2005 ) .",
    "pulsars are essentially rotating dipoles and the super - strong magnetic field naturally implies a high degree of linear polarization with the position angle ( pa ) of the radiation parallel ( or perpendicular ) to the magnetic field direction .",
    "therefore , as the dipole field sweeps past the observer once per rotation of the pulsar , the observer sees a characteristic s shaped sweep of the position angle .",
    "known as the rotating vector model ( rvm ) , it provides a simple mapping between the relevant geometrical angles and the position angle variations @xcite .",
    "the pa as a function of pulse longitude , @xmath4 , can be expressed as @xmath5 here , @xmath6 is the angle between the rotation axis and the magnetic axis , and @xmath7 , with @xmath1 being the angle at closest approach of the line of sight to the magnetic axis .",
    "@xmath8 is the corresponding pulse longitude at which the pa is then pa@xmath9 .",
    "note that we follow the observer s sign convention for the pa , which differs from that introduced by damour & taylor ( 1992 , see also everett & weisberg 2001 ) .",
    "the rvm has been used extensively to derive geometrical angles in a number of pulsars @xcite .",
    "unfortunately there are many factors which mean that @xmath6 and @xmath1 are often subject to large uncertainties .",
    "these include a covariance between @xmath6 and @xmath1 which can not be broken over the usually small longitude range over which pulsars emit ( e.g.  von hoensbroech & xilouris 1997 , everett & weisberg 2001 ) , but also orthogonal modes and propagation effects in the pulsar magnetosphere @xcite . for these reasons",
    "multi - frequency studies of a given pulsar rarely give similar values for @xmath6 and @xmath1 as the uncertainties are large ( e.g. mitra & li 2004 ) .",
    "some information about the geometry can also be obtained from the evolution of pulse profiles with frequency .",
    "observational data show that low frequency pulse profiles tend to be wider in extent than high frequency profiles @xcite and the explanation for this is that radio emission originates at different heights in diverging dipolar magnetic field lines . in this model ,",
    "high frequency radio emission originates from closer to the stellar surface than low frequency emission with emission heights ranging from several tens to several hundreds of km @xcite .",
    "recent evidence tends to suggest that , at a given frequency , the emission height varies across the polar cap with lower emission heights over the magnetic axis @xcite . also , observations indicate that low - frequency profiles are often dominated by strong central components whereas high - frequency profiles show strong outrider components in many cases .",
    "this has been interpreted as indicating a different spectral index for core and cone emission @xcite , while geometrical factors may be at least partly responsible @xcite .    when considering emission heights , it is intriguing to also consider the observational consequences of relativistic effects in the magnetosphere .",
    "blaskiewicz , cordes & wasserman ( 1991 ) pointed out that , to first order , the main effect is that the pa swing is delayed with respect to the total intensity profile and the magnitude of this effect is directly propotional to the emission height .",
    "this effect should therefore be frequency dependent if different frequencies originate at different heights .",
    "the studies by blaskiewicz et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , von hoensbroech & xilouris ( 1997 ) and mitra & li ( 2004 ) showed evidence for this effect in a sample of pulsars .    in this paper , we present observations and their analysis of a 100-ms pulsar discovered by damico et al .  ( 1988 ) which allows us , as it turns out , to study our described understanding of pulsar emission .",
    "initial observations showed that the profile consisted of two widely separated components .",
    "polarization observations at 0.66 and 1.6  ghz were carried out by qiao et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and wu et al .",
    "( 1993 ) respectively .",
    "they showed that the profile is virtually 100 per cent linearly polarized with an indication of a small fraction of circular polarization .",
    "the time resolution of the observations was low and each component was largely featureless .",
    "( 1993 ) attempted an rvm fit to the pa swing and determined that @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "this fit indicated that the emission arises from a single pole and supported the idea that young pulsars had wide profiles @xcite .    in a survey looking for pulsar wind nebulae , gaensler et al .",
    "( 1998 ) discovered an unusual looking nebula around .",
    "the head of the nebula is clearly resolved and a bow - shock indicates that the direction of motion of the pulsar is at an angle of @xmath2315(measured as north through east ) .",
    "polarization properties of the pulse profile can give an indication of the position angle of the pulsar s rotation axis and we will investigate if the correlation between the velocity and rotation axis seen by johnston et al .",
    "( 2005 ) is also evident in this pulsar , and whether it confirms the direction of motion suggested by gaensler et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "the organisation of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly discuss multi - frequency observations of  as part of a bigger campaign to measure polarization in southern pulsars generally . in section 3",
    "we show how the profile of  evolves with frequency and present our rvm fits , and re - examine in particular the question of whether this pulsar shows emission from a single , wide pole or from two poles .",
    "we discuss the implications of the rvm fits in section 4 and derive a model for the beam of .",
    "all observations were carried out using the parkes 64-m radio telescope located in central new south wales , australia .  was observed on a number of occasions at a range of frequencies over the period 2004 december to 2007 july .",
    "the observing bands were centred on frequencies of 1.37 , 3.10 and 8.6 ghz .",
    "the bandwidths used were 256 , 1024 and 512 mhz respectively . in all cases , the backend used was the wideband correlator specifically designed for high - time - resolution polarimetric observations of pulsars . at all frequencies we sampled the data with 1024 phase bins across the pulse period .",
    "the correlator performs on - line folding and de - dispersion at the topocentric period and dispersion measure . before each observation of the pulsar ,",
    "a pulsed calibration signal was observed to allow correction of the gain and phase between the two feed probes . at each frequency observations",
    "were made of the flux calibrator hydra a to provide accurate flux densities .",
    "data reduction was carried out using the psrchive software package @xcite .",
    "the final product was a fully polarimetric- and flux - calibrated pulse profile at each frequency .",
    "we are able to obtain absolute position angles for the linear polarization using techniques described in johnston et al .",

    "figure [ fig : profiles ] shows the polarization profiles of  obtained at 1.4 , 3.1 and 8.6  ghz .",

    "the higher time and frequency resolution of our data compared to that of wu et al .",
    "( 1993 ) allows us to distinguish features in the profile not previously seen .",
    "the main pulse ( mp ) consists of a small leading component blended with a stronger , narrower trailing component .",
    "in contrast , the interpulse ( ip ) is a separated double profile with the trailing component somewhat stronger than the leading component .",
    "johnston & weisberg ( 2006 ) have pointed out that a double - pulse structure with the trailing component dominating appears typical of young pulsars generally and both the mp and ip show this behaviour .",
    "the mp - ip separation remains essentially constant at all frequencies and the intensity ratio of mp and ip remains unchanged , indicating similar radio spectra .",
    "the ip shows hardly any frequency evolution , although the central part between the prominent components becomes noticeably weaker , leading to sharper inner edges of the components .",
    "this behaviour is typical for many pulsars @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the mp undergoes clear changes with frequencies .",
    "the dominant component remains the strongest at all frequencies , while the outer components ( in particular the leading one ) become weaker at higher frequencies .",
    "typical of young pulsars , the profile of  ( both mp and ip ) is virtually 100 per cent linearly polarized . only at 8.4  ghz",
    "does the polarization appear to decrease with both mp and ip having a fractional polarization near 70 per cent .    at 1.4",
    "ghz the mp shows positive circular polarization in the first two components with a hint of negative circular in the trailing component .",
    "the value of @xmath14 is 4.1 per cent . in the ip ,",
    "there is no circular polarization in the leading component but about 9 per cent of negative circular polarization in the trailing component . at 3.1",
    "ghz the polarization has changed sign in the dominant component of the mp - there is little or no circular polarization at the leading component but about 9 per cent of negative circular polarization in the trailing component the peak of which is offset from the total intensity peak . in the ip",
    "the circular polarization remains negative in the trailing component with a value of about 7 per cent . at 8.6  ghz the circular polarization has increased in the main component of the mp .",
    "there is now 15 per cent of negative circular polarization and the peak of the circular is aligned with the total intensity peak . in the ip ,",
    "the circular polarization is rather low with an upper limit of about 6 per cent but appears to be positive in sign . in other words",
    ", it seems that the mp and ip show a mirror - symmetry in changing handedness of circular polarisation .",
    "we note that in the low frequency profiles of qiao et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , there appears to be little circular polarization in the interpulse but significant positive circular in the main pulse .",
    "the picture where circular polarization is stronger in the trailing component in young pulsars was pointed out by johnston & weisberg ( 2006 ) but this is one of the few pulsars in which the sign of @xmath15 changes as a function of frequency . in the compilation of han et al .",
    "( 1998 ) only psr  b1240@xmath064 shows unambiguous evidence for a sign change from low to high frequencies .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      figure [ fig : pafit ] shows the measured values of the pas of the linear polarisation , @xmath16 , and fits of the rvm to those .",
    "in contrast to the large majority of pulsars where the small duty cycle prevents a reliable determination of the rvm parameters @xcite , the highly polarized ip of  allows a very precise measurement of the magnetic inclination angle @xmath6 , the impact parameter @xmath1 ( or alternatively , the line - of - sight angle @xmath7 ) , and the offset angles @xmath17 and @xmath8 , determining the symmetry positions of the fitted curve in pa and longitude , respectively .",
    "table [ tab : paresults ] lists the results obtained for each frequency .",
    "we obtain excellent fits with a reduced @xmath18 of close to unity at all three frequencies , clearly indicating an orthogonal geometry .",
    "this is in contrast to the results of wu et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , who obtained @xmath6=58 . inspecting their fig .",
    "4 , we note that our pa values for the ip are offset from theirs by 180  ( an inherent ambiguity to measured pas ) .",
    "performing a fit to our pa values in such an arrangement is possible but results in much worse fits ( @xmath19 ) , so that we believe that our solution is the correct one .",
    "indeed , a free fit to all parameters results in consistent values at all frequencies , in particular , in @xmath6 close to 96 . given the problems often encountered in obtaining reliable rvm fits , this is an extraordinary result .",
    "the results are so precise that they reveal a surprising , unexpected decrease in the magnitude of the impact angle @xmath1 with increasing frequency .",
    "we confirm this observation by keeping @xmath6 fixed in subsequent fits ( see table  [ tab : paresults ] ) and a visiual inspection of figure [ fig : pafit ] which indeed shows a steeping of the pa curve at the inflexion point @xmath8 .",
    "we see the same trend , albeit with much larger uncertainties , by fitting the mp and ip separately .",
    "such fits can also be used to determine the @xmath8 independently for mp and ip . doing this by keeping @xmath6 fixed to @xmath20 ( see below ) to increase the accuracy , we measure an mp - ip separation of @xmath8(mp)@xmath21(ip)@xmath22 .    for reason discussed in detail in section  [ scattering ]",
    ", we consider the solution obtained at the highest frequency as the correct intrinsic geometry .",
    "we therefore come to the conclusion that @xmath23=96 , @xmath24=@xmath06 , @xmath25=84 , @xmath26=6 .",
    "this implies that we are seeing the mp and ip at the same impact angle on opposite sides of the pole .",
    "this is unusual in itself , compare for example the situation in psr  b1702@xmath019 , where the impact angles for the mp and ip are quite different @xcite .",
    "finally , the inflexion point of the rvm occurs _",
    "later _ than either the profile midpoint or the profile peaks .      as outlined in the introduction , gaensler et al .",
    "( 1998 ) detected a bow - shock nebula around , with the inference that the direction of motion was @xmath2315 .",
    "the rvm fits described above show that the rotation axis points towards 48or 228 .",
    "there is therefore an offset of 87  between the proper motion direction and the rotation axis .",
    "we have shown elsewhere @xcite that the probable implication of this is that the proper motion vector and rotation axis are likely to be aligned , with the pulsar emitting linear polarisaion in a mode with the plane of polarisation orthogonal to the magnetic field direction .",
    "this is consistent with our earlier results obtained from different samples of pulsars , and also confirms the interpretation of the bow - shock nebula by gaensler et al .",
    "the geometrical interpretation of the rvm implies that the determined values for @xmath6 and @xmath1 should be independent of frequency .",
    "therefore , our results of a changing @xmath1 and @xmath8 reported in figure [ fig : pafit ] and table  [ tab : paresults ] are somewhat surprising .",
    "usually , the geometry of a pulsar can not be determined with such high precision as is possible here , so that this effect may not have been noticed for other sources before .",
    "however , rather than questioning the geometrical interpretation of the rvm , other explanations may apply . indeed , as we show in the following , the apparent change can be explained by an undetected scattering of the pulse profile at lower frequencies .",
    "we investigated the impact of interstellar scattering on the observed pa swing in a similar fashion to that presented in the research note of li & han ( 2003 ) .",
    "we confirm their results that large scattering leads to flat pa curves over the longitudes of the scattering tail .",
    "such obvious effects of scattering are , however , not visible in the data for   presented here .",
    "hence , we studied the impact of much smaller scattering times . for this we used a noise - free template constructed from the determined gaussian decomposition of the observed profile .",
    "we assigned a constant degree of linear polarisation and computed stokes @xmath27 and @xmath28 from the rvm fits to the 8.4 ghz data as shown in table  [ tab : paresults ] .",
    "we then convolved the stokes @xmath29 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 with a scattering tail as caused by a thin screen in the interstellar medium located half - way between the pulsar and the observer ( e.g.  williamson 1972 ) .",
    "the resulting pa swing was computed from the scattered stokes @xmath27 and @xmath28 intensities and subjected to the same rvm fitting process as the real data .",
    "this process was repeated for scattering times in the range from zero to five phase bins , yielding the results shown in figure  [ fig : sim ] .",
    "the general agreement between the simulations and the observations is remarkable . while the predicted change in @xmath8 is somewhat too large , the behaviour of the measured @xmath6 and @xmath1 is well reproduced .",
    "this confirms that , based on the polarization profile observed at 8.4 ghz , the pa swings ( and the derived values for @xmath6 and @xmath1 ) at 3.0 and 1.4 ghz can be well explained by a scattering of the profile with scattering times of only about 200@xmath30s and 500@xmath30s , respectively .",
    "these scattering times are so small , that the corresponding total power profiles are hardly distinguishable from the unscattered profile in our simulations .",
    "future high - resolution low - frequency studies should enable us to trace the frequency evolution of these scattering effects .    while the geometry derived from the rvm",
    "is therefore indeed independent of radio frequency , we note that the simulations also produce a shift in absolute pa that does depend on observing frequency . even though this shift is only 4  over a frequency range from 1.4 to 8.4 ghz , we point out that this effect might affect rotation measures determined from rvm fits over widely separated frequencies .",
    "however , the precision to which the geometry can be determined for  is unrivalled , so that in practice this effect may be small compared to other sources of uncertainties .",
    "the precision obtained in fitting the rvm model to the observed data , promises to allow us to study aberration effects in pulsar radio emission . a first - order relativistic treatment of",
    "the rvm leads to the expectation that the inflexion point of the pa swing , @xmath8 , should be delayed with respect to the profile midpoint by an amount @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the emission height @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty in showing whether aberration is occuring or not is the determination of the location of the pulsar s fiducial point . for pulsars with symmetrical pulse profiles ,",
    "one generally locates the fiducial point in the profile centre but for more complex pulse profiles the situation is much less clear although one can also use the profile s frequency evolution as a help . in the case of",
    ", the mp is rather asymmetric ( and becomes more so at higher frequencies ) . for the ip ,",
    "the profile is much more symmetrical ( and remains so at high frequencies ) , suggesting that the ip midpoint should be separated by 180  from the fiducial point of the mp .",
    "this is indeed how we chose the zero - degree reference point for the pulse longitude in fig  [ fig : profiles ] , even though it is clearly not centred on the mp profile .",
    "we discuss this issue further in the next section .",
    "we can draw all the strands of the above arguments together to come up with a plausible beam model for  for the following reasons .",
    "we believe the best location for the fiducial point of the mp and ip is at 0  and 180as shown in fig  [ fig : profiles ] .",
    "first , this is the midpoint of the symmetrical ip profile .",
    "secondly , there is a hint of a central component at this location in the ip at 1.4  ghz and this has a steeper spectral index than the outer components in accordance with the general rule for central components .",
    "this implies that the leading component in the mp is more centrally located ( and also has a steeper spectral index ) and we see emission at the trailing edge but not at the leading edge of the emission cone .",
    "the offset between our purported profile fiducial point and the inflexion point as determined by the rvm is therefore some 11 .",
    "this value can be used to determine an emission height of @xmath2230  km and the emission from both the mp and ip must originate from approximately the same height . in turn , the emission height can be used to determine the half - opening angle of the open fieldline region , @xmath33 , which must then be @xmath218 .",
    "this is about a factor of two larger than the measured half - width of the profile which is about 9  for both the mp and ip ( although we do not see the leading emission in the mp ) .",
    "interestingly , the derived value of @xmath33 for  is very close to that given by the relationship @xmath34 with the pulse period @xmath35 measured in seconds ( e.g.  kramer et al .",
    "1994 ) , determined empirically from a large sample of pulsars .    in figure",
    "[ fig : geo ] we have drawn a sketch of a possible configuration of the beam for both the mp and ip .",
    "the emission appears to arise from a cone of thickness @xmath23  which is located about half way out to the last open field lines .",
    "the emission cone is not fully illuminated but rather consists of active patches .",
    "both the mp and the ip sight lines appear to cross two such patches .",
    "what is remarkable is that the active regions in the magnetosphere near both poles happen to lie on the same cone .",
    "high time resolution observations over a range of frequencies for  have enabled us to determine the geometry and beam shape of the pulsar .",
    "uniquely amongst pulsars , even amongst those with interpulses , we have been able to determine highly constrained rvm fits which show conclusively that  is an orthogonal rotator .",
    "we have shown that the value of @xmath1 appears to be frequency dependent ; however careful modelling shows that this appears to be entirely due to the effect of interstellar scattering of the profiles .",
    "while other factors usually dominate the uncertainties in the geometry derived from rvm fits , it should be considered in particular for low - frequency observations or observations of short - period pulsars .",
    "it will also be relevant for future high - sensitivity detections and studies of interpulse sources with the square - kilometre - array @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the relativlely high ratio of spin - down luminosity @xmath36 to distance @xmath37 as measured by @xmath38 erg s@xmath39 kpc@xmath13 makes this pulsar potentially detectable with the gamma - ray large area space telescope ( glast ) .",
    "this would be an exciting opportunity to test competing @xmath40-ray emission models , given the very well determined geometry of this pulsar .",
    "for instance , outer gap models ( e.g.   chiang & romani 1994 ) predict that orthogonal rotators should be @xmath40-ray bright as we look directly into the null - charge surface , i.e.  the bottom part of the outer gap ( yadigaroglu & romani 1995 ) .    we have shown that the total intensity structure of the mp and the ip in have similarities . while the degree of linear polarisation is very large in both mp and ip , the circular polarisation changes handedness with increasing frequency with an intriguing mirror - symmetry between the mp and ip .",
    "the emission comes from a height of @xmath2230  km in both and is consistent with an origin in a cone with a radius of only one half of the beam opening angle .",
    "the cone is patchy as we do not detect the leading emission from the mp .    in summary",
    ", this pulsar represents a show - case for many features of pulsar radio emission , combined in a single , remarkable source .",
    "but most of all , this source provides conclusive evidence for the geometrical interpretation of the pa swing within the rvm .",
    "many pulsars , however , in particular recycled pulsars , show large deviations from a simple rvm swing in which cases the geometrical interpretation has to be questioned . in this case",
    ", however , the evidence is incontrovertible .",
    "the australia telescope is funded by the commonwealth of australia for operation as a national facility managed by the csiro .",
