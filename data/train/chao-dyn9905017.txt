    "are structures ( sheets or filaments of vorticity ) a vital ingredient of intermittency in 3d - incompressible turbulence ?",
    "to date , this important question remains open @xcite , and an answer starting from first principle , i.e. , from a controlled approximation to the navier - stokes equations , seems over the horizon .",
    "the new understanding of the anomalous scaling in the kraichnan s model of passive advection @xcite , based on the identification of zero modes in the homogeneous hopf equations for equal - time correlators , has in particular strengthened the belief that field - theoretical methods would eventually be able to capture the full statistics of turbulent flows without an explicit account of structures .",
    "interestingly enough , the relative interplay between coherent ordered structures and incoherent turbulent fluctuations turns out to be a subtle matter already in the restricted framework of the so - called shell models of turbulence @xcite .",
    "it was noticed very soon @xcite that elementary bricks of intermittency in those deterministic 1d - cascade models could be pulses or bursts of activity growing in an almost self - similar way as they move from large to small scales",
    ". however , genuine dynamically stable self - similar solutions of the equations of motion in the inertial range display an unique scaling exponent ( to be denoted below as @xmath2 ) , provided they are localized in @xmath3-space ( which , in the shell model approach , reduces to a discrete set of wave numbers @xmath4 , where the shell index @xmath5 goes from 1 to @xmath6 ) . furthermore , the exponent @xmath2 , giving the logarithmic slope of the velocity gradient spectrum left in the trail of the pulse , happens to be rather close to the kolmogorov value @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) in the case of the gledzer - okhitani - yamada ( goy ) model , in the range of parameters where it reproduces at best the multiscaling properties of real turbulent flows .    in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the role played by the interaction of pulses with the rest of the flow in producing more singular events was unravelled , and a two - fluid picture was introduced , where coherent structures form in and propagate into a featureless random background .",
    "our goal in this paper is to elevate this still rather qualitative proposal to the rank of a semi - quantitative theory and to test its predictive power about intermittency in the goy model .",
    "we shall assume that turbulent fluctuations on the shells downstream the pulse , i.e. , small scales , act on the coherent part of the flow as a random , white - in - time , gaussian forcing and ask whether the inviscid stochastic extension of the goy model obtained in this way is able to reproduce the statistics of strong deviations of the full turbulent system in the inertial range .",
    "there is _ a priori _ quite a lot of freedom in the parameterisation of the forcing .",
    "therefore , in order to keep things as simple as possible , we bind ourselves to use a single adjustable parameter ( hereafter noted @xmath0 ) , which measures the level of noise .",
    "we consider the semiclassical limit @xmath9 of these systems and study the statistics of singular structures appearing in this regime .",
    "semiclassical ( or instanton ) techniques are well suited to capture large and rare excursions of fluctuating fields @xcite . as such ,",
    "they have gained recently a renewal of interest in the field of turbulence and have already led to noteworthy results in the context of burger s turbulence @xcite , and of the kraichnan s model of passive scalar advection @xcite .",
    "one usually starts from a path integral representation of high order structure functions and uses a saddle point approximation to determine the coupled field - force configurations contributing mostly to those quantities .",
    "the nature of the statistical object to be computed imposes precise boundary conditions on the physical field and the random force ( respectively at large and small scales , where the cascade processes start and end ) .",
    "instantons , which in the inertial range often reduce to a self - similar collapse along some spatial dimensions , are eventually selected by a delicate matching procedure at the two boundaries . in shell models we are dealing with an intrinsically discrete lattice of logarithmic scales . as a consequence , the analytic computation of instantons is completely out of reach in the inertial range , not to speak about the matching on both sides of the cascade . to circumvent this difficulty , we shall focus on the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of scaling exponents after @xmath5 cascade steps , @xmath10 , and argue that , in the semiclassical limit @xmath9 , this pdf builds up from the neighborhood of a single self - similar instanton ( of scaling exponent @xmath1 ) that dynamic stability considerations will help us to construct numerically . in order to get non trivial physics , it turns out to be necessary to perform the semiclassical expansion of @xmath11 ( the rate of rarefaction of singularities of scaling exponent @xmath1 in the multifractal picture ) up to next to leading order in powers of @xmath0 .",
    "this can be achieved via a summation over quadratic fluctuations around the instantons , once the proper set of boundary conditions for the corresponding trajectories in configuration space has been defined .",
    "we shall show in details how to carry out this program and end up with a prediction for @xmath10 lending itself to a straight confrontation with the pdf of effective scaling exponents of coherents events that can be extracted from simulations of the goy model at very high reynolds numbers .",
    "although our interest lies primarily in gaining a better understanding of intermittency in the framework of shell models of turbulence , the emphasis will be put in this paper on the technical aspects of the method that we had to develop for computing instantons .",
    "we believe that this method is general enough to find applications in other contexts or physical problems , like for instance the motion of complex objects or excitations on 1d - lattices in the presence of a co - moving random environment .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ def ]",
    ", we define the stochastic extensions of the goy model that we shall study . in section [ msrformalism ] the equations of motion for instantons",
    "will be derived using the well - known martin siggia rose path integral representation of probability distribution functions for stochastic dynamical systems .",
    "section [ extsol ] is devoted to the computation of self - similar extremal trajectories , with the theoretical considerations underlying the solution explained in subsection [ extsoltheory ] and its practical implementing , together with the results , exposed in subsection [ extsolimplementing ] .",
    "the important effect of quadratic fluctuations and the rather heavy formal work behind their computation are discussed in section [ fluct ] .",
    "the comparison of the results issuing from the instanton approach with numerical data on the statistics of coherent structures in the genuine goy model is given in section [ discussion ] .",
    "we conclude in section [ conclusion ] , in particular as to the relevance of a two - fluid description of intermittency in shell models of turbulence .",
    "equations of motion for the goy model in the inertial range read  : @xmath12 where the complex variable @xmath13 should be understood as the fourier component of the gradient velocity field at wavenumber @xmath14 and the integer @xmath5 runs from @xmath15 to @xmath16 . throughout this paper , usual values of parameters",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 will be assumed .",
    "it is convenient to cast ( [ goymod ] ) in a vectorial form @xmath19 , \\label{goyvect}\\ ] ] where the infinite - dimensional vector @xmath20 is built up from the @xmath21 s , while the @xmath22 component of the nonlinear kernel @xmath23 $ ] is given by the right hand side of ( [ goymod ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting at this point that @xmath24 plays dimensionally the role of enstrophy in real flow and that the inverse square root of this quantity sets the order of magnitude of the smallest time scale on the shell lattice .",
    "+ since quadratic nonlinearities lead generically to finite time singularities , it is very useful to introduce a desingularizing time variable @xmath25 related to the physical time @xmath26 by the differential law @xmath27 this turns ( [ goyvect ] ) into @xmath28 } { ( { { \\bf b } } ^{*}\\cdot { { \\bf b } } ) ^{1/2 } } , \\label{goytau}\\ ] ] where both sides of the equation have the same scaling dimension in the field @xmath20 , which shows that an infinite `` time '' is now required to form a singularity by travelling across the whole shell axis .",
    "> from previous work @xcite , we know that every initial condition of finite enstrophy , when evolving under dynamics ( [ goytau ] ) , eventually organizes itself in a soliton - like pulse , moving from large to small scales at a constant speed with an exponential growth of its amplitude .",
    "the asymptotic state is unique , up to trivial phase symmetries of the goy model @xcite , time translations or multiplicative rescaling of the field @xmath20 , which all leave the equation of motion ( [ goytau ] ) invariant .",
    "we may restrict our attention without loss of generality to the case where the phase pattern along the shell axis does not break into a three - sublattice structure .",
    "the asymptotic floquet state , to be noted henceforth @xmath29 , is then purely real and such that  : @xmath30 the period @xmath31 is the `` time '' needed for the center of the pulse to go from shell @xmath5 to shell @xmath32 , while the ( positive ) lyapunov exponent @xmath33 controls its growth .",
    "both quantities @xmath31 and @xmath33 , are dynamically selected in an unique way .",
    "the scaling exponent @xmath2 associated to the pulse ( fixing in particular the logarithmic slope of the spectrum left in its trail ) can be extracted from the identity @xmath34 .",
    "its value turns out to be 0.72 in the case of the goy model for the choice of parameters stated before .",
    "+ we turn now to the stochastic models , that we are interested in solving by the instanton method .",
    "their physical motivation has been explained in ref  .",
    "@xcite  : we assume that pulses parameterize adequately singular ( and temporally coherent ) structures in shell models but that the deterministic dynamics ( [ goyvect ] ) should be enlarged towards a stochastic one , in order to describe the interaction of a given pulse with incoherent fluctuations produced by the relaxation of the trails left by its predecessors .",
    "we are therefore led to consider the following extension of the original inviscid goy model  : @xmath35 + \\sqrt{\\gamma } ( { { \\bf b } } ^{*}\\cdot { { \\bf b } } ) ^{3/4 }   b [ { { \\bf c } } ] { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\eta$}}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is a gaussian noise , delta - correlated in time and shell index , whose correlations read  : @xmath37 the various factors coming in front of @xmath36 in ( [ def : syststoch ] ) have the following meaning  : the number @xmath0 fixes the relative strength of incoherent fluctuations with respect to coherent ones and we shall be interested in the semiclassical limit of small @xmath0 amenable to semi - analytic treatment . as will be clearer in a while , the overall scale factor @xmath38 is there to keep noise relevant all along the cascade , thereby preserving scale invariance",
    ". finally the matrix @xmath39 $ ] , of zero scaling dimension in the field @xmath20 since it depends only on the unit vector @xmath40 , may be used either to introduce spatial correlations of noise ( along the shell axis ) or to localize its action with respect to the instantaneous position of the pulse .",
    "although the formalism to be developed in this paper can deal with the most general situation , we restricted ourselves in practical investigations to diagonal matrices @xmath39 $ ] , just playing with the degree of localization of noise . results will be presented for three rather emblematic choices of @xmath41  : ( i ) @xmath42 , which describes a completely delocalized noise ; ( ii ) @xmath43 which keeps some flavour of the original goy dynamics and makes noise active just at the leading edge of the pulse ; and finally ( iii ) @xmath44 , which removes the action of noise further away from the center of the pulse .",
    "we must emphasize that these particular choices were not dictated by rigorous considerations on the underlying dynamics of the goy model , but rather used to scan the variety of behaviours which may be expected from such stochastic dynamical systems .",
    "it should be noted that the strucutre of the matrix @xmath41 is not constrained by any conservation law , since the coherent part of the flow does not form anymore a closed system , even in the inertial range , in our two - fluid description .",
    "finally , to simplify the following analysis , we are going to restrict the fields @xmath20 and @xmath36 in ( [ def : syststoch ] ) and ( [ def : correl1 ] ) to being real - valued vectors and neglect the effect of imaginary fluctuations .",
    "this is certainly not a serious restriction as for the instantons themselves , which are expected to be , like the self - similar deterministic solution described above , purely real , up to trivial phase symmetries of the goy model .",
    "it can also be remarked that the model ( ii ) ( which will be found later on to give the more convincing results ) does not require a complex noise , since the phase degrees of freedom have already been incorporated in the definition of the matrix b in that case .",
    "+ while the deterministic dynamics ( [ goyvect ] ) selects a single self - similar solution blowing up in finite time with scaling exponent @xmath2 , the presence of noise in ( [ def : syststoch ] ) allows for a continuum of scaling exponents , even in the manifold of normalizable fields @xmath20 . in the small noise ( or semiclassical ) limit @xmath9 , the probability density of developing an effective growth exponent @xmath1 after @xmath45 cascade steps will take the form  : @xmath46,\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the action per unit cascade step of the self - similar extremalsolution of scaling exponent @xmath1 of optimal bare gaussian weight ( or instanton ) , and @xmath48 measures , to lowest order in @xmath0 , how the basin of attraction of the instanton in phase space evolves with the number of cascade steps .",
    "note that the argument of the exponential in ( [ pred_pn ] ) , @xmath49 , is nothing but the cramr function introduced in the theory of large deviations , which governs the rate of rarefaction of singularities in the multifractal picture @xcite .",
    "we will show in this paper how to compute in a clean way both quantities @xmath50 and @xmath48 . before doing this",
    ", we must carefully handle problems related to the time discretization of the stochastic equation ( [ def : syststoch ] ) since a consistent treatment of them is necessary to get the right expression of the first correction @xmath51 .",
    "we shall adopt the view that the initial stochastic equation ( [ def : syststoch ] ) is to be understood in the stratonovich sense @xcite .",
    "however , in the path integral formulation of stochastic dynamical systems that we shall heavily use in the following , it is much simpler to work with the ito prescription which , in the limit of small time steps , amounts integrating ( [ def : syststoch ] ) within a basic euler scheme with all @xmath20-dependent quantities in the r.h.s .",
