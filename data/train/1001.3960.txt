    "we continue here our investigation , begun in @xcite , of the fractional level wess - zumino - witten model with chiral symmetry algebra @xmath2 and level @xmath3 .",
    "such fractional level theories were originally proposed @xcite and studied @xcite long ago as ( supposedly ) rational conformal field theories .",
    "these works were inspired by attempts to generalise the coset construction of @xcite to non - unitary models and the discovery @xcite that the characters of certain fractional level irreducible representations carry a finite - dimensional representation of the modular group . despite a significant amount of work",
    "however , fractional level theories remained poorly understood and their consistency as theories was regarded as questionable at best @xcite .",
    "more recently , a study of the @xmath4 @xmath2-theory revealed that the obstacle to understanding such theories was the assumption of rationality @xcite ( in fact , non - rationality had already been pointed out in the vertex algebra literature @xcite ) . using powerful algorithms to compute the abstract fusion of representations @xcite",
    ", it was shown that this fractional level theory is not rational ; rather , it possesses an infinite spectrum of distinct representations .",
    "moreover , this theory was proven to be logarithmic , meaning that the virasoro zero - mode @xmath5 failed to be diagonalisable .",
    "subsequent studies for @xmath3 confirmed this lack of rationality and suggested that for certain levels one could have both a non - logarithmic and a logarithmic fractional level model @xcite .",
    "these later works utilised the well known fact ( see @xcite for example ) that the @xmath6 system of bosonic ghosts , which we shall hereafter refer to as the @xmath7 ghost system , exhibits an @xmath0 symmetry",
    ".    one of the stated aims of @xcite was to put the equivalence of the @xmath7 system and the @xmath0 model on a firm basis .",
    "there , this problem was attacked with the help of an auxiliary free field realisation and some rather formidable computations of four - point correlators .",
    "a motivation for the research reported in @xcite was to simplify and make precise this equivalence by working intrinsically , that is without needing any free fields .",
    "this was achieved by using the elegant formalism of extended algebras developed in @xcite to realise the @xmath7 chiral algebra as the simple current extension of @xmath0 .",
    "this precise treatment allowed us to correct several errors in the literature and led to a complete description of the meaning of modular invariance in fractional level theories .",
    "the rational ( non - negative integer level ) wess - zumino - witten models have long been regarded as the fundamental building blocks of unitary ( rational ) conformal field theory .",
    "their proposed fractional level counterpoints were intended to play a similar foundational rle in constructing non - unitary ( but still rational ) conformal field theories .",
    "what the results of @xcite suggest is that this rle of fractional level wess - zumino - witten models might be extended so as to also regard them as fundamental building blocks of ( rational and quasi - rational ) logarithmic conformal field theory .",
    "this is of not insignificant interest .",
    "logarithmic conformal field theory , itself introduced almost twenty years ago @xcite , has recently undergone a resurgence of activity as various groups have started using it to describe so - called non - local observables in the continuum limit of statistical lattice models @xcite ( see also @xcite for further mathematical and field - theoretic studies ) and propose bridges with the theory of schramm - loewner evolution @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has recently been suggested that the conformal field theories dual to certain topological gravity theories on @xmath8 are logarithmic @xcite .    with this in mind , we are continuing our study of @xmath0-theories with the twin aims of understanding the logarithmic model proposed in @xcite and evaluating the ( conjectured ) rles of these theories as building blocks from which we can construct other logarithmic conformal field theories . to be sure",
    ", the closely related @xmath7 ghost system is commonly used as such a building block in free field realisations . however , our philosophy is different . just as we have understood the relationship between @xmath0 and the @xmath7 ghosts by starting with the former rather than the latter ( even though the latter is free ) , so we would like to achieve our stated aims without resorting to free field methods where possible . as we will see , we are only partially successful in following this philosophy , but our deviations are not crippling to the overall idea .",
    "the advantages of this approach are clarity and , more importantly , generality . by developing methods suited to an intrinsic understanding of @xmath0",
    ", we expect to be able to apply these methods to other fractional level theories for which free field realisations are not obvious .",
    "the article is organised as follows .",
    "first , in section  [ secold ] , we summarise our notations and conventions and review some pertinent results on the non - logarithmic @xmath0-theory that were obtained in @xcite . we take some time to explain how modular invariance is interpreted within this theory , emphasising in particular the rle played by what we call the `` grothendieck ring of modular characters '' and its relation to the fusion ring .",
    "section  [ seccoset ] commences with a detailed study of the @xmath9 coset theory obtained from this @xmath0-theory and its obvious @xmath10-subtheory .",
    "we identify the spectrum of the coset theory in terms of irreducible virasoro modules and compute the multiplicities with which they appear .",
    "we then note in section  [ sectriplet ] that grouping the states of the coset theory appropriately gives rise to characters which match those of two of the irreducible modules of the celebrated _ triplet model _ of @xcite .",
    "this is perhaps the best known , and certainly best understood , example of a _ rational _ logarithmic conformal field theory .",
    "we subsequently verify that our coset theory admits the triplet algebra as a chiral algebra . here",
    "the computations become slightly unwieldy , so we depart from our usual philosophy and instead derive the chiral algebra of the corresponding coset of the @xmath7 system .",
    "naturally , this gives the simple current extension of the triplet algebra , the algebra of symplectic fermions @xcite .",
    "the triplet algebra result follows straight - forwardly , leading to the relationships summarised in the following diagram : @xmath11 the theories at left have @xmath9 whereas those at right are @xmath6 . reversing the horizontal arrows in this diagram roughly corresponds to finding free field realisations .",
    "however , we would like to stress once again that the methods we employ generalise much more readily .",
    "perhaps the most important realisation of this identification of the coset chiral algebra is that the coset spectrum is incomplete .",
    "indeed , the latter is not even modular invariant even though the parent theory is ( in the sense described in section  [ secold ] ) .",
    "we rectify this unsavoury feature in section  [ secaugment ] by _ augmenting _ the original @xmath0-theory with additional irreducible modules .",
    "these turn out to be of the class known as relaxed highest weight modules @xcite .",
    "this motivates the introduction of a `` bigger '' @xmath0-theory , which we expect will be the sought - after intrinsic realisation of the `` logarithmic lift '' of @xcite .",
    "however , we do not verify this here .",
    "rather , we prefer to defer the confirmation and investigation of the logarithmic nature of our augmentation to a companion article @xcite .",
    "this is necessitated by the technical subtleties involved in determining the fusion rules of this new theory and fully analysing the mathematical structure of the indecomposable @xmath2-modules so - obtained .",
    "we instead conclude in section  [ secconc ] with a brief comparison between what we have achieved and the constructions of @xcite and a proposal for how one can still accommodate the notion of modular invariance within our augmented theory .",
    "we first review for convenience certain features of the ( non - logarithmic ) fractional level @xmath0 model , as detailed in @xcite .",
    "our conventions for @xmath12 are given with respect to the basis @xmath13 for which the non - trivial commutation relations are @xmath14 } = 2 e , \\qquad { \\bigl [ e , f \\bigr ] } = -h \\qquad \\text{and } \\qquad { \\bigl [ h , f \\bigr ] } = -2 f.\\ ] ] the second of these relations perhaps deserves comment : the basis we use is not the usual cartan - weyl one ( in which @xmath15 } = h$ ] ) .",
    "rather , it is related to the cartan - weyl basis via @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in particular ,",
    "the killing form is determined by @xmath19 with all other combinations giving zero .",
    "we make this choice of basis from the outset because it is tailored to the @xmath20 adjoint , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and it is with this adjoint that one derives the @xmath7 ghost system as an extended algebra .",
    "indeed , the usual @xmath23 adjoint gives rise to a closely related , but mildly non - associative , extended symmetry algebra .",
    "the above conventions for @xmath12 carry over to the affinisation @xmath2 in the usual way . with the central mode",
    "being replaced by the level @xmath24 , the non - trivial commutation relations are @xmath25 } = 2 e_{m+n } , \\quad { \\bigl [ h_m , h_n \\bigr ] } = -m \\delta_{m+n,0 } , \\quad { \\bigl [ e_m , f_n \\bigr ] } = -h_{m+n } + \\frac{1}{2 } m \\delta_{m+n,0 } \\quad \\text{and } \\quad { \\bigl [ h_m , f_n \\bigr ] } = -2 f_{m+n}.\\ ] ] it follows from equation   that the energy - momentum tensor of the theory is given by @xmath26 and corresponds to central charge @xmath27 .",

    "this is indeed a representation , but it will not be isomorphic to @xmath58 in general , even though the underlying representation space @xmath59 has not changed .",
    "we wish to concentrate on modules rather than representations in what follows .",
    "it is therefore convenient to distinguish the above twisting at the level of modules by defining ( somewhat artificially ) the twisted module @xmath61 . as a vector space ,",
    "this is identical to @xmath59 , but the action of @xmath2 is different . specifically , if @xmath62 , so @xmath63 , then @xmath2 is defined to act on the twisted module via @xmath64 dropping the representations makes this more succinct : @xmath65 we will moreover usually drop the superscript in @xmath66 and instead speak of the automorphism @xmath38 inducing twist maps , also denoted by @xmath38 , between modules .",
    "we illustrate the families constituting the spectrum of the @xmath0-theory in figure  [ figspecflow ] .",
    "note that the conformal dimensions of the states of the modules with @xmath67 are not bounded below ( in particular , they are not highest weight modules ) .",

    "it is therefore easy to obtain fermionic character formulae for its modules .",
    "as each ghost module decomposes into two level @xmath24 @xmath2-modules , we deduce similar character formulae for the latter .",
    "in particular , ( * ? ? ? * eqn .",
    "( 9.18 ) ) yields @xmath93 where @xmath94 as always .",
    "this should be compared to the standard bosonic character formulae ( reproduced in ( * ? ? ?",
    "( 6.4)(6.5 ) ) for example ) : @xmath95 both the bosonic and fermionic forms converge for @xmath96 and must be expanded in the annulus @xmath97 in the complex @xmath98-plane so that the correct weight multiplicities of the module are generated @xcite .",
    "we emphasise however that the @xmath7 ghost theory is _ not _ equivalent to the @xmath0-theory under consideration .",
    "the former is obtained by formally extending the chiral algebra of the latter by the fields of the @xmath2-module @xmath33 .",
    "but the modular invariants of the @xmath0-theory were completely classified in ( * ? ? ?",
    "10 ) and it turns out that the fields of @xmath33 are _ never _ coupled to the ( antiholomorphic ) identity field .",
    "the `` equivalence '' of the theories can therefore only be regarded as pertaining to their chiral halves , not as full conformal field theories .",
    "this is not insubstantial however .",
    "for example , it allows us to identify certain _ chiral _ correlation functions in the two theories ( although we would then have to `` glue '' the holomorphic and antiholomorphic results differently when constructing the full correlators of the two inequivalent theories ) .",
    "it remains to discuss the modular invariance of the theory .",
    "the theory is only _ quasi - rational _ ( in the sense of nahm @xcite ) so its modular properties are significantly more subtle than those of rational conformal field theories .",
    "we will therefore take some time to emphasise the differences .",
    "first , we normalise the characters ( in the standard way ) by multiplying by @xmath99 .",

    "\\end{cases}\\ ] ] the normalised characters therefore span a four - dimensional vector space , despite the fact that they are supposed to collectively encode the weight space multiplicities of an infinite number of modules .",
    "modules with the same character are only distinguished by their ( disjoint ) annuli of convergence in the @xmath98-plane .",
    "however , these annuli are not preserved under modular transformations , so we can only define an action of the modular group if we agree to ignore convergence regions .",
    "it follows that the modular properties of the theory will be blind to such distinctions , so only four independent characters can be relevant to such considerations .",
    "we will refer to the characters , _ sans _ convergence region , as _ modular characters _ in what follows .",
    "to summarise , we have a bijective correspondence between modules and characters with a given region of convergence . to consider modular properties , we are now forced to `` forget '' these convergence regions , thereby losing the bijectivity .",
    "what we gain is that the so - obtained modular characters are now , artificially , defined ( almost ) everywhere in the @xmath98-plane , so that they admit a well - defined action of the modular group .",
    "formally , we are defining a projection from the abelian group ( with operation @xmath101 ) generated by the @xmath75 , the _ grothendieck group of modules _ , to the abelian group generated by the corresponding normalised characters , the _ grothendieck group of modular characters_. one can easily check that the kernel of this projection is precisely generated by the modules of the form @xmath102    now , the grothendieck group of modules comes equipped with a multiplication  fusion .",
    "we may therefore speak of the grothendieck ring of modules , or in more standard terminology , the fusion ring .",
    "but it is easy to check from equation   that the kernel of the projection discussed above is an ideal of the fusion ring , so the fusion operation descends naturally to the grothendieck group of modular characters ( fusion is therefore well - defined at the level of these characters ) .",
    "this latter group may thus be given a ring structure , so we will refer to it as the _ grothendieck ring of modular characters_.    the above discussion makes it clear that the grothendieck ring of modular characters is a quotient of the true fusion ring of our theory .",
    "however , it does not possess some of the nice features that one would expect of a fusion ring .",
    "in particular , the structure constants of a fusion ring ( the fusion coefficients ) are non - negative integers in the canonical basis , and the conjugation automorphism @xmath77 acts as a permutation there .",
    "neither of these statements holds in the grothendieck ring of modular characters ( note that @xmath77 has a well - defined action on this quotient ) .",
    "they are spoiled by the consistent appearance of negative integer coefficients , which we can trace back to the `` @xmath101 '' in equation  .    nevertheless , it is the grothendieck ring of modular characters on which the modular group acts , _ not _ the fusion ring .",
    "the @xmath103 and @xmath104-matrices of the theory are therefore @xmath105 by @xmath105 matrices , and turn out to be symmetric and unitary as one would hope .",
    "but , as has been known for a long time , @xmath106 is not a permutation matrix and the verlinde formula , @xmath107 gives positive and negative integer `` fusion '' coefficients .",
    "however , one easily verifies that @xmath106 is precisely the matrix representing conjugation in the grothendieck ring of modular characters and that the @xmath108 are precisely the structure constants of this ring .",
    "this realisation @xcite fully resolved the puzzle of `` negative fusion coefficients '' , at least for @xmath0 , and it is clear that the story should be analogous for other fractional level theories .",
    "we will construct the coset theory @xmath109 where the @xmath10 subtheory is generated by the virasoro primary field @xmath29 .",
    "this is then a fractional level analogue of the parafermion theories of @xcite .",
    "the @xmath10 subtheory has energy - momentum tensor given by @xmath110 and central charge @xmath31 , so the coset theory is a @xmath111 theory with energy - momentum tensor @xmath112 it follows that the virasoro zero - mode in the coset theory takes the form @xmath113 the states of the coset theory may then be realised as the @xmath10-highest weight states of the @xmath0-theory .",
    "the coset construction @xcite guarantees that these states carry a representation of the virasoro algebra @xmath114 .    as",

    "we are led to a precise conjecture : the set of @xmath10-highest weight states with given @xmath12-weight @xmath115 decomposes as a @xmath114-module into the irreducibles @xmath124 here , @xmath125 denotes the irreducible ( @xmath111 ) @xmath114-module whose highest weight state has conformal dimension @xmath126 , and the prime indicates that the sum index @xmath127 increases by @xmath83 .",
    "we emphasise that @xmath128 may take half - integer values , so equation   describes the coset decomposition of both @xmath2-modules @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "it now follows that the character of this infinite sum of modules is then @xmath129 ( the unprimed sum on the right hand side increases by @xmath31 as per usual ) . comparing with equation",
    ", we see that our conjecture will be proven if we can demonstrate the following equality : @xmath130 the additional factor of @xmath131 on the right hand side precisely accounts for the characters of the @xmath10-modules with respect to which we have decomposed our theory .",
    "we verify equation   in appendix  [ appcomb ] .",
    "we could also decompose the twisted modules @xmath75 with @xmath68 into @xmath10-modules and determine the corresponding coset @xmath114-representations .",
    "however , we would quickly discover that there is little point to this exercise , as the coset representations obtained are the same , regardless of the value of @xmath132 .",
    "this should not be surprising as the virasoro algebra does not admit any non - trivial spectral flow automorphisms . to verify this properly ,",
    "note that under the action of the spectral flow automorphism @xmath38 ( given in equation  ) , @xmath12-weights are only shifted by a constant , in fact by the level @xmath24 .",
    "spectral flow therefore maps a set of states of constant @xmath12-weight to another set of states of constant @xmath12-weight , preserving the multiplicities .",
    "the decomposition into @xmath10-modules will therefore be identical .",
    "it remains only to check the conformal dimensions of the coset ( virasoro ) highest weight states .",
    "but , applying @xmath38 to equation   gives @xmath133 so the coset dimensions do not change under spectral flow .    in summary then , we have derived the spectrum of the ( chiral ) coset theory . with the usual field identifications derived from chiral algebra automorphisms ( spectral flow ) , we can restrict our attention to the decomposition of the untwisted modules @xmath32 and @xmath33 . the spectrum then consists of the irreducible @xmath114-modules @xmath134 for @xmath135 , and each such module appears with multiplicity @xmath136 . however , these @xmath136 copies are not completely identical . because the states of the coset theory are @xmath10-highest weight states of @xmath2-modules , they come equipped with an extra quantum number , the @xmath12-weight ( or equivalently , the @xmath137-charge ) .",
    "it is therefore more honest to say that the @xmath136 copies of the @xmath114-module @xmath134 are distinguished by their @xmath12-weights , which are @xmath127 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",

    "the fusion rules close on this larger set of modules .",
    "for now we wish to concentrate on the two highest weight modules of the triplet algebra whose dimensions are @xmath69 and @xmath31 .",

    "this also accords with the highest weight state multiplicities which we have observed in our coset theory ( take @xmath156 in the above ) , leading us to conjecture that this coset theory is nothing but the triplet model .",
    "more precisely , we conjecture that our coset model has the same extended chiral symmetry algebra as the triplet model . this is a reasonable hope as we know that the fields of the @xmath0 vacuum module are chiral , so the fields into which these decompose in the coset model will also be chiral .",
    "moreover , by equation   the `` extended ''",
    "coset vacuum module has character @xmath157 which coincides with the character of the triplet vacuum module @xcite ( the @xmath98-dependence can be verified within the symplectic fermion framework ) .",
    "this coincidence suggests that the coset theory admits the same chiral algebra as the triplet model , but proving this requires some non - trivial arguments and computations .",
    "we turn to these next .    in principle",
    ", we should start calculating correlation functions in the coset theory .",
    "this would then enable us to deduce operator product expansions for the chiral fields , and we would expect to thereby uncover those of the triplet algebra ( equation  ) .",
    "however , determining correlators of coset theories is generally acknowledged to be quite hard  the coset mechanism is not well - suited for such computations @xcite  and in most cases one has to resort to a free - field realisation .",
    "luckily , here we can proceed chirally by using the @xmath7 ghost system , itself a free - field realisation of the @xmath0-theory that we started with .",
    "we will show in what follows that the algebra structure of the coset of the ghosts by its @xmath10-subtheory is completely fixed by its vacuum module structure .",

    "we remark that this approach is constructive  the rather complicated form of the triplet algebra operator product expansions ( equation  ) will be verified as a simple corollary of those of the ghost coset theory .",
    "to begin , we recall that the vacuum module of the ghost theory is formed from the @xmath24 @xmath2-modules @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xcite .",

    ", we expect that this augmentation will also lead to a logarithmic conformal field theory .",
    "at first sight , it seems unreasonable to try to augment the fractional level @xmath0 theory .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the structure of the irreducible vacuum module selects the four admissible modules of kac and wakimoto as the only highest weight modules allowed in the theory .",
    "these are all irreducible , and all four are required if we insist upon modular invariance @xcite . however , these highest weight modules do not close under fusion or conjugation , rather they generate infinite sequences of irreducible modules which are not highest weight ( section  [ secold ] ) .",
    "it is therefore germane to wonder if there are not other non - highest weight `` admissible '' modules ( in the sense that they are likewise selected by the structure of the irreducible vacuum module ) which we have not yet considered .    a strong clue as to where we should look for such additional admissible modules is contained in gaberdiel s work @xcite on @xmath197 .",
    "there , it was found that the admissible highest weight modules and their spectral flows do not close under fusion but also generate modules whose zero - grade subspace is neither highest nor lowest weight for @xmath12 .",

    "consider therefore the ( non - trivial ) vanishing singular vector of the vacuum @xmath2-module at @xmath24 .",

    "if both @xmath213 and @xmath214 are given by the first possibility of equation  , then substituting into equation   implies that @xmath215 , hence that @xmath216 .",

    "this analysis , similar to that reported in @xcite , therefore indicates that there should be further modules , built from these zero - grade subspaces , which are not forbidden in an @xmath0-theory .",
    "we now ask ourselves how we can decide which of these modules we should choose to augment our current theory by , so as to obtain the triplet model as a coset theory .",
    "the answer to our question lies in determining the conformal dimensions of the coset theory states corresponding to these new zero - grade states .",
    "since the relaxed highest weight states are assumed to be annihilated by the @xmath203 with @xmath231 , equation   gives the conformal dimension as @xmath232 note that for @xmath127 integral , this formula precisely reproduces the dimensions @xmath233 of the extended kac table , table  [ tabkactable ] , with @xmath234 .",
    "it follows that a _ relaxed _ highest weight @xmath2-module whose zero - grade subspace consists of relaxed highest weight states of conformal dimension @xmath225 and @xmath12-weights in @xmath235 will decompose in the coset model into virasoro modules with highest weight states of dimensions @xmath225 , @xmath236 , @xmath237 and so on .",

    "as given however , we have the natural interpretation that the two irreducible @xmath2-modules @xmath191 and @xmath192 combine to form a single irreducible module for the @xmath7 ghost algebra . this latter module will therefore have a zero - grade subspace with one state @xmath201 for each integral weight @xmath252 .",

    "the norms of these basis elements have the form @xmath258 , and @xmath259 by equation   ( as @xmath260 for @xmath252 by equation  ) .",
    "the module therefore has no null states , so its irreducibility follows from standard arguments .",
    "we pause briefly to mention that the expansion strongly suggests that the relaxed verma modules @xmath249 at @xmath24 have the same `` braided '' submodule structure as the `` admissible '' verma modules .",
    "more precisely , the above expansion is consistent with the picture that there are two independent submodules , generated by states of grade @xmath31 and @xmath83 respectively , whose intersection is the sum of two independent submodules , generated by states of grade @xmath261 and @xmath117 respectively , and so on .",
    "in fact , the submodule structure of relaxed verma modules was elucidated in @xcite and is in agreement with this observation .",
    "the submodule generators at grade @xmath31 have already been given in equation   and those at grade @xmath83 are easily found to be @xmath262 ( and checked to be independent ) .",
    "we note that the coefficients of this formula have a surprisingly regular form .",
    "the conclusion of this exercise is then that the irreducible @xmath2-modules @xmath253 have characters of the form @xmath263 so that their weight space multiplicities do not depend upon the @xmath12-weight .",
    "we can now play the same game as in section  [ seccoset ] to decompose @xmath191 and @xmath192 into @xmath111 virasoro modules in the coset theory .",
    "in fact , decomposing the subspace of @xmath12-weight @xmath115 states into @xmath10-modules ( recalling the latter s character from equation  ) corresponds to the simple character decomposition @xmath264 this latter factor , @xmath265 , is therefore the character of the @xmath9 virasoro module corresponding to the weight @xmath266 subspace .",
    "in contrast to the constant @xmath12-weight characters of equation  , this character does not uniquely determine a virasoro module .",
    "for example , it is obviously the character of the virasoro verma module with highest weight @xmath267 . but one can check that this character is shared by the ( completely reducible ) direct sum @xmath268 where the primed summation means again that the sum index @xmath127 increases by @xmath83 .",
    "of course there are many other possibilities as well . comparing with equation",
    ", we might suspect that is indeed the correct module structure for the weight @xmath266 subspace of the coset decomposition of the @xmath253 .",
    "by the way of evidence for this , we note that the first singular vector in the verma module with @xmath269 ( and @xmath12-weight @xmath69 ) , @xmath270 has zero norm in the module @xmath246 , hence must vanish in @xmath191 .",
    "this singular vector is therefore zero in the coset theory , ruling out the verma module possibility .",
    "this does not prove that the coset module decomposes as in .",
    "however , we do not need such a result because we have already determined that the chiral algebra of the coset theory is the triplet algebra . by massaging the above characters as in equations   and ,",
    "we conclude that @xmath191 and @xmath192 give rise to coset modules with respective characters @xmath271 since these coincide with the irreducible triplet module characters with highest weight states of dimensions @xmath74 and @xmath153 respectively @xcite , we can conclude that the coset modules described above are precisely these triplet modules .",
    "what we have thus shown is that augmenting @xmath0 by the admissible irreducible modules @xmath191 and @xmath192 ( and their twisted versions under spectral flow ) leads to a @xmath10-coset theory which contains _ all _ of the irreducible modules of the triplet model .",
    "it only remains to show that this augmentation also generates indecomposable modules corresponding to those of the triplet model , thus identifying the coset theory as the triplet model .",
    "we will accomplish this in a sequel @xcite by analysing the fusion rules of our augmented theory @xmath242 in detail .",
    "in the preceding sections , we have identified the coset conformal field theory obtained from @xmath0 and its @xmath10-subtheory . while this coset resembles the @xmath272-parafermion theories of zamolodchikov and fateev @xcite in form , we see little in the way of structural resemblance . instead , we find that this fractional analogue of the parafermions forms ( a part of ) the triplet model of gaberdiel and kausch @xcite .",
    "is @xmath31 .",
    "it would be very interesting to check for parafermionic behaviour at more general levels .",
    "for example , @xmath273 has integral part equal to @xmath122 . ]",
    "more precisely , we have shown that the @xmath0-theory detailed in @xcite yields two of the four irreducible triplet modules under this identification , and moreover that the coset theory admits the triplet algebra as an extended chiral symmetry algebra .",
    "this left us in an interesting situation in which the coset theory was not modular invariant despite the invariance of the parent @xmath0-theory .",
    "of course , as we explained in section  [ secold ] , the modular invariance of the latter theory is quite a subtle affair , so perhaps it is not surprising that mismatches such as this can occur . nevertheless , it led to the realisation that the consistency of our coset theory was far from satisfactory ( at least on a torus ) .",
    "such a situation is not unheard of , and generally one adds in some sort of twisted modules to restore modular invariance to the coset . here ,",
    "the resolution was the same and of course previous studies of the triplet model tell us exactly which additional modules were required .",
    "however , we took this one step further by insisting that these new modules should be obtainable from the @xmath0-theory .",
    "in other words , we reverse - engineered our original @xmath0-theory , _ augmenting _ it with additional modules , so as to guarantee the modular invariance of the coset theory .    following this philosophy , the two irreducible triplet algebra modules which were missing from the coset theory were discovered to be obtainable from @xmath2-modules , albeit from a class of modules which were not originally considered , the so - called relaxed highest weight modules . specifically , we found two modules , @xmath191 and @xmath192 , which were the only ( relaxed ) highest weight modules to yield the missing triplet modules .",
    "moreover , both @xmath191 and @xmath192 were shown to be admissible in the sense that they are not forbidden by the structure of the vacuum module ( mathematically , they are representations of the corresponding _ vertex algebra _ ) .",
    "this led to a proposed augmentation of the original @xmath0-theory by @xmath191 , @xmath192 and their images under the spectral flow .",
    "we have denoted the corresponding augmented theory by @xmath242 .",
    "in contrast to @xmath0 , we do not expect to have identified the full spectrum of @xmath242 .",
    "indeed , the additional two irreducible triplet modules which necessitated this augmentation are well - known to fuse into modules which are reducible but indecomposable @xcite .",
    "it is these indecomposables which are responsible for the logarithmic nature of the triplet model conformal field theory .",
    "by now it should not be surprising to learn that the same turns out to be true for fusions of @xmath191 and @xmath192 ( this will be addressed in a sequel @xcite ) .",
    "the augmented theory @xmath242 is therefore likewise a logarithmic conformal field theory .",
    "a logarithmic version of the @xmath0-theory was previously proposed in @xcite where it was referred to as a logarithmic _",
    "lift_. actually , the authors of this paper proposed two different lifts based on different versions of the free field realisation that they relied upon .",
    "this realisation utilised two fermionic fields @xmath166 and @xmath274 to generate the chiral algebra and the two proposed lifts corresponded to whether they extended this algebra with formal antiderivatives of one or both of these fields .    extending with one formal antiderivative led them to the construction of two relaxed highest weight modules ( for @xmath2 ) similar to our @xmath191 and @xmath192 , but with weights belonging to @xmath275 and @xmath276 respectively .",
    "neither module was irreducible  in accordance with equation  , the zero - grade states with @xmath12-weights @xmath56 and @xmath229 are lowest weight states for @xmath12 which thereby generate proper @xmath2-submodules .",
    "we will therefore denote these indecomposable modules of @xcite by @xmath277 and @xmath278 ( the `` @xmath279 '' superscript indicating the presence of a lowest weight state with the weight given in the subscript ) .",
    "it now appears that this particular extended free field realisation amounts to another augmentation of @xmath0 , different to that which we have proposed here .",
    "furthermore , the authors of @xcite claim that their augmentation is closed under fusion ( without any justification ) and leads to no logarithmic phenomena , the complete opposite to what we expect for our augmentation .",
    "but we think it important to point out that their augmentation modules @xmath277 and @xmath278 are neither self - conjugate nor conjugate to one another  the conjugates would be @xmath280 and @xmath281 respectively ( in hopefully obvious notation )  in contrast to @xmath191 and @xmath192 .",
    "we therefore conclude that even if the augmentation by @xmath277 and @xmath278 closes under fusion , it is automatically unsatisfactory as a candidate for a conformal field theory because many of its fields will have no conjugate and so must decouple from all correlation functions . the only recourse is to augment further by the conjugate modules @xmath280 and @xmath281 .",
    "we strongly suspect that this , more consistent , augmentation will not close under fusion .",
    "we speculate that the reason why @xmath280 and @xmath281 were not uncovered in @xcite was because the chiral algebra was only extended by the single formal antiderivative @xmath282 .",
    "this clearly breaks the symmetry between @xmath274 and @xmath166 , so it seems reasonable to suppose that extending instead by the formal antiderivative of @xmath166 would lead to the conjugate modules @xmath280 and @xmath281 , rather than @xmath277 and @xmath278 ( after all , @xmath166 is the conjugate field to @xmath274 in their setup ) .",
    "if this is so , then we could conclude that the consistency of the augmented theory requires extending by _ both _ formal antiderivatives .",
    "happily , the authors of @xcite also analysed this possibility . using symplectic fermions and a free boson , they proposed two @xmath2-modules with logarithmic structures ( non - diagonalisability of @xmath5 ) .",
    "these structures were not however derived from any underlying insight into augmentations of @xmath0 , but were rather determined directly as a consequence of the known logarithmic structures of symplectic fermion modules @xcite .",
    "given however that symplectic fermions are intimately related to the triplet model , it therefore seems likely that the logarithmic structures pictured in @xcite will turn out to be similar or identical to those ( which we expect to find ) in our proposed augmentation by @xmath191 and @xmath192 .",
    "we refer to our forthcoming article @xcite for a more detailed discussion of this point .",
    "even if this turns out to be the case , there are compelling reasons to continue investigating the augmentation @xmath242 which we have proposed in this article .",
    "first , it is logically motivated through studying the consistency of the theory and its cosets .",
    "in particular , we have proven that to obtain the triplet model as a coset , we must include @xmath191 and @xmath192 ( and hence their twisted images under spectral flow ) .",
    "these modules do not seem to appear in other discussions relating @xmath0 and the triplet model ( or symplectic fermions ) .",
    "second , the level @xmath283 is the simplest example of a variety of fractional level theories whose properties remain largely unexplored .",
    "we do not expect that many other admissible levels have easily guessed free field realisations , so it makes sense to develop methods and techniques which rely on such realisations as little as possible .",
    "finally , fusing @xmath191 and @xmath192 should lead to indecomposable @xmath2-modules whose algebraic structures can be explored in detail .",
    "these indecomposables should provide analogues of the well - known staggered modules of the virasoro algebra @xcite .",
    "elucidation of their general properties will be essential in unravelling further properties of fractional level theories .",
    "we turn now to a brief discussion concerning the modular invariance of the augmented theory @xmath242 .",
    "the spectrum of our original @xmath0-theory was already known to be modular invariant with a perfectly satisfactory verlinde formula ( section  [ secold ] ) .",
    "we should therefore explain why augmenting the theory by @xmath191 and @xmath192 does not destroy this rather nice state of affairs . at first glance",
    ", the situation appears hopeless .",
    "the characters of @xmath191 and @xmath192 do not converge for any value of @xmath98 , so making any sense of them beyond formal generating functions for weight multiplicities seems pointless .",
    "however , there is one possibility which accords well with the mathematical principles described in section  [ secold ] and which also preserves the modular structure found for @xmath0 .",
    "it is perhaps best to first describe this possibility for one of the indecomposable modules studied in @xcite , @xmath277 say .",
    "the corresponding character is easy to compute and is in fact also given by equation   ( with @xmath284 ) .",
    "it too does not converge for any value of @xmath98 .",
    "however , as remarked above , @xmath277 has a submodule generated by the zero - grade state of weight @xmath56 and it is not hard to see that this submodule must be isomorphic to @xmath285 .",
    "moreover , the quotient by this submodule can only be @xmath71 .",
    "it therefore follows that , at the level of formal ( normalised ) characters , @xmath286 as modular characters , where we forget about convergence , the left hand side makes no sense .",
    "but the right hand side does , as the sum of the modular characters of @xmath287 and @xmath288 .",
    "it is therefore natural to define the left hand side to be this sum also . and",
    "of course , this sum gives _",
    "zero _ because of equation   ( and the surrounding discussion ) .",
    "the above prelude is intended to convince the reader that it is natural to assign the modular character @xmath69 to the module @xmath277 .",
    "we now want to extend this argument to the irreducible modules @xmath191 and @xmath192 which can not be decomposed into a non - trivial submodule and its quotient .",
    "mathematically , the above argument amounts to splitting the ( otherwise horribly divergent ) sum @xmath289 into two pieces , one with @xmath290 and one with @xmath291 .",
    "the cutoff @xmath292 in fact depended upon the grade in the module ( power of @xmath293 in the character ) .",
    "and of course if one completely ignores the fact that the two sums thereby obtained converge on disjoint sets , then summing gives @xmath69 , independent of the chosen cutoff .",
    "the proposal is then that the irreducible modules @xmath191 and @xmath192 should also be assigned modular character @xmath69 .",
    "a consequence is that these modules join those of equation   in generating the kernel of the projection from the fusion ring onto the grothendieck ring of modular characters , thereby preserving the modular structure of section  [ secold ] .",
    "this might seem unpalatable to some , but we believe that this is the only logical way of extending the notion of modular invariance to our augmented theory . of course , that this makes a modicum of sense does not guarantee that this proposal has any physical relevance , but at least we can be content in knowing that it preserves the mathematical structures , in particular the verlinde formula , that have contributed so much to the recent interplay between mathematics and physics .",
    "we conclude with a brief outlook .",
    "the most immediate questions raised by the work reported here involve `` fleshing out '' our proposed augmentation to the @xmath0-theory .",
    "this means computing the fusion rules of the augmented theory and work is already underway in this direction @xcite . as noted already",
    ", we expect that the results of these fusion computations will involve indecomposable @xmath2-modules on which @xmath5 acts non - diagonalisably .",
    "the investigation of the mathematical structure of these indecomposables is therefore also of immediate interest and we will also report on this soon .",
    "we further remark that fusion computations such as these should be of significant interest to those who study string theory on @xmath294 and its universal cover @xmath8 .",
    "it is perhaps worthwhile emphasising that a consequence of the work reported here is a new construction of the triplet algebra .",
    "this is a well known example of what are generally referred to as _ w - algebras _ in the conformal field theory literature  chiral algebras generated by fields with conformal dimension greater than @xmath83 .",
    "such algebras are not universal enveloping algebras of lie algebras , so we know comparatively little about their structure and representations , except in a few isolated cases ( see @xcite for an example ) .",
    "various w - algebras have recently been proposed ( but without specifying the algebraic structure ! ) as extended chiral algebras for many logarithmic conformal field theories @xcite .",
    "it is therefore evident that a construction of such algebras from a much simpler algebra , analogous to obtaining the triplet algebra from @xmath2 , would be extremely desirable .",
    "we hope that the ideas outlined here will be of some use in obtaining such constructions .",
    "another pressing matter is to lift our conclusions from chiral considerations to the bulk regime . to our knowledge",
    ", this question has not yet been seriously addressed for admissible level theories such as @xmath242 .",
    "even for the original @xmath0-theory of section  [ secold ] , the coupling of holomorphic and antiholomorphic sectors is obscured by the fact that the modular invariant only describes a small quotient of the fusion ring .",
    "we expect that the work of @xcite on such couplings for the triplet model will be very useful aids in this regard .",
    "finally , we mention that it might be very interesting to consider more stringent constraints upon the consistency of a proposed conformal field theory , such as crossing symmetry ( or more general sewing constraints ) .",
    "in particular , it is important to confirm that the two @xmath0-theories discussed here are indeed consistent conformal field theories ( or not , as the case may be ! ) .    finally , it has recently been brought to our attention that a @xmath10 coset of the @xmath197 theory of @xcite has been studied in the vertex algebra literature @xcite .",
    "the level @xmath295 theory has @xmath296 , so the coset theory shares its central charge @xmath297 with another triplet theory , the so - called @xmath298 triplet model ( the original triplet model of @xcite corresponds to the @xmath299 theory in this framework ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is predicted in @xcite that the chiral algebra of the coset theory @xmath300 is generated by a single field of conformal dimension @xmath261 .",
    "the @xmath298 triplet algebra has _ three _ generators of this dimension ,",
    "so this prediction is at odds with what one might expect from the results presented here .",
    "it would be extremely interesting to understand why the @xmath301 case is different from the @xmath24 theory in this regard .",
    "whatever the outcomes , it should now be clear that the world of admissible , fractional level wess - zumino - witten - theories is ready to be explored .",
    "the technology used here and in @xcite will greatly improve our knowledge of these important models .",
    "we therefore envisage their further study , emphasising that these models should provide basic building blocks for quasi - rational and logarithmic conformal field theories , just as the integer - level wess - zumino - witten - models do for rational conformal field theories .",
    "i would like to thank pierre mathieu and yvan saint - aubin for discussions and detailed comments on various drafts of this paper .",
    "i likewise thank hubert saleur for his comments and thomas creutzig , matthias gaberdiel , thomas quella and alexei semikhatov for useful and enjoyable conversations related to the work presented here .",
    "i also thank antun milas for bringing various results from the vertex algebra literature to my attention .",
    "in this appendix , we prove equation   for @xmath302 .",
    "the result for @xmath303 then follows from symmetry under @xmath304 .",
    "this proof will follow from an identity of cauchy ( * ? ? ? * thm .",
    "2.1 ) : @xmath305 here , @xmath306 denotes the usual @xmath293-factorial @xmath307 . setting @xmath308 and @xmath309 then gives @xmath310    as is often the case , it is easier to prove a generalisation of equation  .",
    "we therefore consider @xmath311 putting @xmath308 then gives @xmath312 replacing @xmath127 by @xmath313 on the left hand side and @xmath314 by @xmath315 on the right hand side then gives equation  .",
    "let @xmath201 be an eigenstate of @xmath316 with eigenvalue @xmath127 .",
    "if we assume that @xmath201 is not highest weight , then we may write @xmath317 for some constant @xmath213 . repeating this for @xmath318 , @xmath319 and the states thereby generated ,",
    "we construct a basis for the module generated by @xmath201 .",
    "note however that @xmath21 gives @xmath320 so @xmath321 whenever @xmath322 ( and @xmath323 ) are non - zero .",
    "moreover , @xmath324 which gives @xmath325 we remark that @xmath218 would now imply that @xmath326 , hence that @xmath327 .",
    "this reflects the fact that one can not define a non - trivial hermitian form on an @xmath12-module with non - real weights .",
    "recall that the quadratic casimir is defined ( up to normalisation ) by inverting the killing form : @xmath328 using equation  , we calculate its eigenvalue on @xmath201 to be @xmath329 and it is easily checked ( using equation   again ) that @xmath330 is periodic in @xmath127 with period @xmath83 .",
    "this eigenvalue is therefore constant on the @xmath12-module generated by @xmath201 , as it must be .",
