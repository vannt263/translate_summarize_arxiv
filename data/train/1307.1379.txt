    "gaussian random fields ( grfs ) have a dominant role in spatial modelling and there exists a wealth of applications in areas such as geostatistics , atmospheric and environmental science and many other fields @xcite .",

    "even though the grfs have convenient analytical properties , the covariance - based models for constructing grfs are hindered by computational issues , or the so - called `` _ _ big-@xmath49 _ _ problem '' @xcite .",

    "in this section we discuss how to use the spdes approach to construct multivariate grfs .",
    "one of the appealing properties of this approach is that the spde specification _ automatically _ constructs valid covariance functions .",

    "the parameters in the parametric model from the spdes approach are interpretable in terms of co - located correlation coefficients , smoothness , marginal variances and correlations .",
    "and there is a correspondence to the parameters in the covariance matrix based models .",
    "a zero mean @xmath75dimensional multivariate ( or @xmath75dimensional @xmath29-variate ) grf is a collection of continuously indexed multivariate normal random vectors @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a non - negative definite matrix that depends on the point @xmath3 .",
    "define the system of spdes @xmath78 where @xmath79 ; @xmath80 , are differential operators and @xmath81 are independent but not necessarily identically distributed noise processes .",

    "define the operator matrix @xmath83 and @xmath84 and then the system of spdes can be written in compact matrix form as @xmath85 where @xmath86 denotes the collection of parameters .",
    "similarly as equation we apply fourier transforms to equation , and it yields @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the frequency , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the fourier transforms of the random fields and the noise processes , respectively , and @xmath91 is the matrix formed from the fourier transforms of the operator matrix @xmath92 .",
    "each element has the form @xmath93 with @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",
    "from equation one can find the spectral process as @xmath96 .",
    "the corresponding power spectrum is defined as @xmath97 , where @xmath98 denotes the hermitian transpose of a matrix .",
    "simple calculations using the above mentioned formulas yield @xmath99 where @xmath100 denotes the inverse of the hermitian transpose of fourier transform of the operator matrix @xmath101 .",
    "the equation can be written explicitly as @xmath102 let @xmath103 denote the power spectrum matrix of the noise processes , @xmath104 .",
    "if the noise processes are mutually independent , @xmath105 is a diagonal matrix and we write it as @xmath106 where @xmath107 .",
    "this means it is easy to obtain this matrix . in general , with equations to we can compute all the components in .",
    "we show how to do this for bivariate random fields in section [ sec : bivariate_grf ] .",
    "it is also possible to construct a multivariate grf using the covariance - based model , but the notorious non - negative definiteness restriction makes it hard . @xcite discussed one such approach in detail .",

    "when @xmath112 , a full characterization of the parameter space is achieved . for @xmath113 @xcite suggested that a parsimonious model should be used in practice .",
    "this kind of model has more restrictions on the smoothness parameter and the scale parameters , such that @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the common scale parameter and @xmath116 for @xmath47 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more information about different kinds of conditions that yield the valid matrix - valued covariance functions .",
    "assume that the components of the covariance matrix are known",
    ". the power spectrum can also be obtained from in this covariance - based approach .",
    "this can in turn be used to compare parameters with the spdes approach .",
    "the covariance matrix of a second - order stationary multivariate matrn grf was given in equation .",
    "the power spectrum in @xmath2 of the cross - covariance function for @xmath41 and @xmath42 is defined as @xmath117 , @xmath118 , which is given by    @xmath119    applying the fourier transform to the covariance matrix in equation yields @xmath120 the comparison between the covariance - based approach and the spdes approach in section [ sec : model_comparisions ] is based on the following fact : if @xmath121 , for each @xmath118 , then the multivariate grfs constructed through the spdes approach and through the covariance - based model are equivalent .",
    "it is known that spatial markovian gmrfs have good computational properties since the precision matrix @xmath58 is sparse .",
    "the markov structure here means that @xmath41 and @xmath42 are independent conditioned on @xmath122 , when @xmath55 and @xmath123 are not neighbors , where @xmath122 means for @xmath124 . in other words , @xmath125 if and only if @xmath41 and @xmath42 are independent conditioned @xmath122 .",
    "so it is possible to read off whether @xmath126 and @xmath127 are conditionally independent or not from the elements of @xmath58 .",
    "note that the precision matrix @xmath58 should also be non - negative definite .",

    "this approach can also be used for spatio - temporal models @xcite . in this paper",
    "we follow the approach presented in @xcite for gmrf approximations to grfs in order to partially resolve the `` _ _ big @xmath49 problem _ _ '' with our models . @xcite",
    "mainly considered univariate grfs with matrn covariance functions . in this case",
    "the gmrf representation was constructed explicitly through the spde , and the solution to the spde driven by the gaussian white noise is a grfs with matrn covariance function .",
    "they showed how to build a grf model with a covariance matrix @xmath129 theoretically from spde , and then use the gmrf to represent the grf , which means the precision matrix of the gmrf fulfills the condition @xmath130 on some predefined norm .",
    "@xcite considered a modification of the spde with a diffusion matrices to control the covariance structure of the grf , and create inhomogeneous grfs , but the gmrf representation is still the main ingredient for computations .    with our spdes",
    "approach we use two steps to construct the multivariate grfs .",
    "the first step is to construct the precision matrices for the noise processes in equation , and the second step is to solve the system spdes with the constructed noise processes .",
    "we focus on the noise processes , if they are not white noise processes , generated by the spde given as follows @xmath131 with the requirements that @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",

    "the generated noise processes in this way are independent but not necessarily identically distributed .",
    "the first step in constructing the gmrf representation for the noise process @xmath136 on the triangulated lattice is to find the stochastic weak formulation of equation @xcite . in this paper delaunay triangulation",

    "denote the inner product of functions @xmath138 and @xmath139 as @xmath140 where the integral is over the region of interest .",
    "we can find the stochastic weak solution of spde by requiring that    @xmath141    in the second step we need to construct a finite element representation of the solution to the spde .",
    "we refer to @xcite and @xcite for more information about finite element methods .",

    "the basis function @xmath143 is chosen to be piecewise linear with value @xmath146 at vertex @xmath147 and @xmath148 at all other vertexes .",
    "this means that a continuously indexed solution is approximated with a piecewise linear function defined through the joint distribution of @xmath149 @xcite .",
    "the chosen basis functions ensure that the local interpolation on a triangle is piecewise linear .",
    "the third step is to choose the test functions . in this paper",
    "we follow the setting used by @xcite . with @xmath150",
    "the test functions are chosen as @xmath151 for @xmath152 and @xmath153 for @xmath154 , which are denoted as a _",

    "we define the required @xmath161 matrices @xmath162 , and @xmath163 with entries @xmath164    and @xmath165    finally , by using these matrices given in and together with the neumann boundary conditions ( zero normal derivatives at the boundaries ) , the precision matrices @xmath166 for noise process @xmath136 can be obtained , @xmath167    as pointed out by @xcite the inverse of @xmath162 , i.e. , @xmath168 , is usually a dense matrix .",

    "the notorious requirement of positive definite covariance matrix is fulfilled automatically .",
    "the second advantage is that we can remove the symmetry property constraint shared by both the covariance - based approach @xcite and the lmc approach @xcite .",
    "the third advantage is that we can construct the multivariate grfs on manifolds , such as on the sphere @xmath253 .",
    "the extension follows the discussion given by @xcite .",
    "we just need to reinterpret the systems of spdes to be defined on the manifold .",
    "one issue that needs to be pointed out is that we have chosen @xmath254 in the model .",
    "this restriction used in this paper is to make the model closer to the models presented by @xcite and also make the inference easier .",
    "this may not be needed in other applications and @xmath213 and @xmath214 can be estimated from the data .",
    "however , @xmath213 and @xmath255 might be not distinguishable with the triangular systems of spdes .",
    "so one suggestion is that if we are use the triangular systems of spdes , then we fix @xmath213 based on some other information or set @xmath256 when doing inference .",
    "another issue that needed to be pointed out is that we have prosecuted the _ full _ version of the spdes approach but have not used in all the examples .",
    "this version could give us more flexibility to construct multivariate grfs .",
    "the modelling procedures and the inference are the same as for the _ triangular _ version of the spdes which were used and discussed extensively in this paper .",
    "we also want to point out that the proposed approach costs effort during the implementation and pre - processing stages since we need to build the system of spdes , discretize the fields and do the approximation to obtain a gmrf representation .",
    "but we believe , as pointed out by @xcite , that `` _ such costs are unavoidable when efficient computations are required _ '' .    similarly , as pointed out by @xcite ,",
    "although the spdes approach presented here is not generally applicable for all covariance functions , it covers many useful model in spatial statistics . and",
    "it is possible to extend our approach to construct even richer class of models by following the discussion given by , for instance , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our approach extends the applicability of multivariate grfs in practical applications since we can build and interpret the model using grfs but do computation with gmrfs .",
    "it is further possible to include this approach in the integrated nested laplace approximation ( inla ) framework @xcite .",
    "these extensions are under study .",
    "in order to prove equation , we need to write down the expression explicitly .",
    "let @xmath257 denote the observed value for each field , @xmath258 the predicated value from a given model , and @xmath259 the true value .",
    "then we have @xmath260 since @xmath261 \\\\                                                                   & = \\mathbb{e}\\left [ ( y_{ij } - \\hat{y}_{ij } ) \\times 0 \\right ] \\\\                                                                    & = 0 .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] so equation is established .",
    "now we show that with the weights @xmath262 , the estimator in equation is an unbiased estimator for the nugget effects . using equation , we know that @xmath263",
    ". then @xmath264 and thus the estimator is unbiased since the scaling constant cancels in the weight coefficient ."
