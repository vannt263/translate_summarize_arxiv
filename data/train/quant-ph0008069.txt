    ", jochen dittmann has derived several _",
    "explicit _ formulas ( ones not requiring knowledge of the eigenvalues of density matrices ) for the bures metric @xcite .",
    "slater @xcite  interpreting the _ volume element _ of the metric as a natural ( unnormalized ) measure on the quantum systems  applied this work to certain low - dimensional subsets of the fifteen - dimensional set of @xmath3 density matrices to obtain `` exact bures probabilities that two quantum bits are classically correlated '' ( cf .",

    "the bures metric on the three - dimensional convex set of the @xmath4 density matrices ( making use of cartesian coordinates ( @xmath5 ) ) , @xmath6 has been intensively studied .",

    "has written that `` the bures metric for a two - dimensional system corresponds to the surface of a unit four - ball , i. e. , to the maximally symmetric three - dimensional space of positive curvature ( and may be recognized as the spatial part of the robertson - walker metric in general relativity ) .",
    "this space is homogeneous and isotropic , and hence the bures metric does not distinguish a preferred location or direction in the space of density operators . indeed , as well as",
    "rotational symmetry in bloch coordinates ( corresponding to unitary invariance ) , the metric has a further set of symmetries generated by the infinitesimal transformations @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 is an arbitrary three - vector [ and @xmath13 , radial distance in the bloch sphere of two - level quantum systems @xcite ] ) . ''",
    "petz and sudr observed that in `` the case of the [ bures ] metric of the symmetric logarithmic derivative the tangential component is independent of @xmath13 '' @xcite .",
    "a principal goal of the present study is to determine any such symmetries possessed by the bures metric when one proceeds from the study of the two - level quantum systems to that of the three - level quantum systems .",
    "one should be aware , though , that dittmann has noted that in this case , the space `` is not a space of constant curvature and not even a locally symmetric space , in contrast to what the case of two - dimensional density matrices might suggest '' @xcite .",
    "( in a locally symmetric space , the sectional curvature is invariant under parallel displacement , and the covariant derivative of the curvature tensor field vanishes @xcite .",
    "a formula for the scalar curvature of the monotone metrics for general @xmath14-level quantum systems is given in @xcite , cf .",

    ", we apply this same formula ( [ form1 ] ) to the _ full _ eight - dimensional convex set of the three - level quantum systems itself . of crucial and central importance here will be the use of a recently - developed `` euler angle '' parameterization of these density matrices @xcite . in this parameterization",

    "( 11 ) , ( 12 ) ) @xmath24    we have inserted the so - parameterized @xmath1 density matrix ( [ pte ] ) into formula ( [ form1 ] ) to obtain the @xmath25 bures metric tensor . since , by construction , we have explicit knowledge of the eigenvalues ( @xmath26 s ) and eigenvectors of @xmath17 , we could alternatively have directly applied the _ general _",
    "formula for the bures metric in the @xmath14-dimensional case ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 10 ) ) , @xmath27 or that given by proposition 4 in @xcite .",
    "initially , all the entries of the tensor computed using ( [ form1 ] )  implemented in mathematica  were given by extremely large complicated expressions . however , in a number of cases , both through exact computations and numerical experimentation , we were able to arrive at certain relatively compact ( if not simply strictly _ zero _ themselves ) expressions for the individual metric elements .",
    "the first remarkable item to note is that ( as repeated numerical experiments indicate ) _ all _ the entries of the tensor are _ independent _ of the euler angle @xmath28 .",
    "further numerical investigations have convinced us that many of the entries of the tensor are , in fact , zero ( cf .",
    "( in the case of the two - level quantum systems , the off - diagonal entries of the bures metric tensor ( [ diag ] ) are zero , if spherical  as opposed to cartesian  coordinates are employed . ) for example , the spherical coordinates @xmath29 and @xmath30 are both orthogonal to the other seven coordinates . the diagonal entry ( @xmath31 ) of the bures metric tensor ( @xmath0 ) corresponding to the pairing @xmath32 is simply 1 , while the diagonal entry ( @xmath33 ) corresponding to the pairing @xmath34 is @xmath35 .",
    "let us summarize our present state of explicit knowledge regarding the bures metric elements ( @xmath2 ) for the three - level quantum systems .",

    "then , we found that the entries of the associated @xmath25 bures metric tensor ( again computed using ( [ form1 ] ) ) were not only independent of @xmath28 , as before , but also of the parameter @xmath12 .",
    "we would like to express guarded optimism that , with sufficient expenditure of computational resources and/or added ingenuity and insight , the question marks in ( [ gmatrix ] ) can be effectively removed , and one proceed with supplementary analyses , such as inversion of the bures metric tensor , for purposes of statistical estimation @xcite ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 7 ) ) and",
    "computation of the volume element of the metric , that is the `` quantum jeffreys prior '' @xcite .",
    "let us note here that the inverse of the bures metric tensor ( [ hhe ] ) for the _ two_-level quantum systems takes the particularly simple form @xmath87    however , we have confirmed that the remaining not explicitly expressed @xmath2 s in ( [ gmatrix ] ) are not simply products of two independent functions , one of the euler angles ( @xmath88 ) , and the other of the spherical angles ( @xmath89 ) . these three yet ( relatively compactly ) unexpressed elements ( that is , @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) are independent only of @xmath28 , and not of the other seven parameters .",
    "if we set @xmath92 , then @xmath93 and both @xmath94 and @xmath95 reduce to ( cf .",
    "* eq . ( 28 ) ) ) @xmath96 if we set @xmath97 , on the other hand , then both @xmath94 and @xmath95 reduce to @xmath98 , that is @xmath99 , while @xmath100 reduces to @xmath101 .",
    "we also can not rule out the possibility that some of the more complicated expressions we have presented here  such as @xmath102 and @xmath100  have , in fact , considerably simpler forms than have so far been uncovered .",
    "in addition to the transformation @xmath103 , which as we have already noted renders _ all _ the elements of the bures metric tensor independent of @xmath12 , as well as @xmath28 , another quite interesting reparameterization would be based on the inversion of the relation ( [ g55eq ] ) , since the element @xmath104 itself enters directly into the expressions for many of the other elements .",
    "that is , one has @xmath105 we have recomputed the bures metric tensor , which we now denote @xmath106 , again with ( [ form1 ] ) , using @xmath107 and @xmath104 as parameters , rather than @xmath84 and @xmath30 as in our main analysis and , indeed , found that @xmath108 has the expected form , that is equalling @xmath104 , and , similar type results for @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "also , numerically @xmath111 .    since m. byrd has indicated that he will shortly present an euler angle parameterization of @xmath112 , parallel to that of @xmath20 @xcite used here",
    ", it will , at that point , be of interest to similarly attempt to recreate the @xmath113 bures metric tensor for the _ four_-level quantum systems  which are capable of describing the state of a pair of _ qubits _ ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . for this task , rather than ( [ form1 ] )",
    ", it will be necessary to use one of the other `` explicit formulae for the bures metric '' given by dittmann in @xcite .    in part",
    "ii of this paper , which is in preparation , we intend to report further progress in the realization and simplification of formulas for the entries of the @xmath25 bures metric tensor _ and _ of its inverse .",
    "these results will be _ applied _ to the study of the curvature properties of the metric ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , following upon the demonstration of dittmann @xcite that the curvature tensor for the bures metric satisfies the yang - mills equation .",
