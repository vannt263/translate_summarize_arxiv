    "observations in the period 2008 august through december @xcite .",
    "these multiwavelength observations revealed that the infrared , optical , and @xmath9-rays were have similar variability patterns .",
    "the @xmath2 rays display similar relative flux changes compared to the longer optical wavelengths , but smaller relative flux changes as the short wavelength optical emission , which @xcite interpreted as being due to an underlying accretion disk .",
    "the _ swift _ x - ray data did not strongly correlate with the other wavelengths , though @xcite and @xcite find a correlation at different epochs .",
    "the _ fermi _ observations of revealed a broken power - law spectrum , with @xmath10 ( where the photon flux @xmath11 ) and @xmath12 , below and above a break energy of @xmath13 gev , respectively @xcite .",
    "this spectrum is not consistent with compton scattering of a lower - energy photon source by jet electrons in the fast- or slow - cooling regimes , the standard interpretation for the high energy spectrum in leptonic models of blazars .",
    "@xcite also consider it unlikely that the spectral break is a result of @xmath14 absorption with a local radiation field or the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) , the former because this would require a lower jet bulk lorentz factor than that inferred from superluminal radio observations of ( @xmath15 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the latter because the universe is transparent to 40  gev photons at @xmath16 for all ebl models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite thus consider the most likely explanation to be that the spectral break is caused by an intrinsic break in the electron distribution .",
    "however , as explained below , this is unlikely , given the broadband spectral energy distribution of this source .",
    "in this letter , we show that a combination of two compton scattering components can explain the break in the lat spectrum of .",
    "in particular , we consider a combination of components from compton - scattered accretion disk and broad - line region ( blr ) radiation , both of which should be strong seed photon sources in fsrqs .",
    "the implications of this model for the blr and for the variability of the emitted radiation are explored .",
    "finally , we conclude with a brief discussion , with implications for breaks in other sources .",
    "we use parameters @xmath17 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 so that , with a redshift of @xmath21 , has a luminosity distance of @xmath22 gpc .",
    "the contemporaneous sed data from are given in @xcite and plotted in fig .",
    "[ 3c454.3sed ] .",
    "the radio data are likely from a larger region of the jet than the rest of the sed , and can be treated as upper limits for the purposes of model fits .",
    "we assume that the electron distribution which produces this radiation has the form of a broken power - law given by @xmath23 for @xmath24 and @xmath25 for @xmath26 .",
    "the _ swift _ uvot data give a power - law spectrum with @xmath27 , presumably from electron synchrotron emission .",
    "the x - rays from the _ swift _ xrt give @xmath28 , which should be the index of the synchrotron emission below the break , assuming that the x - rays are from compton - scattering with the same electrons as are causing the lower - energy synchrotron emission .",
    "thus the _ swift _ data imply that , if the electron distribution can indeed be represented by a double power - law , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , since @xmath31 .",
    "this spectrum indicates a fast cooling regime , where one expects @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the injection index .",
    "if the lat spectrum was the result of thomson scattering of a single source of photons , whether that source is the disk , blr , or dust torus , the spectral indices would be about the same as for the synchrotron , namely , @xmath35 and @xmath36 well below and above the break , respectively . instead , @xmath37 and @xmath38",
    "are observed , respectively , although it is possible that klein - nishina ( kn ) effects could soften the higher energy index .",
    "the lower energy lat index furthermore does not necessarily correspond to the asymptotic value at @xmath39 .",
    "@xcite suggested that the break could be caused by the high energy cutoff in the electron distribution , @xmath40 .",
    "however , if this is the case , below the @xmath9-ray break , one would expect the same @xmath41 as in the optical ( @xmath42 ) , because of their correlated variability , instead of the @xmath43 which is observed",
    ". the @xmath9-ray spectral index could be softer than @xmath44 , due to kn effects , but it is unlikely to be harder .",
    "it is possible that the x - rays through _ fermi _ @xmath9-rays are all created by a single component , likely the ssc component , since this is generally broader than external compton components . in this model ,",
    "the softer @xmath9-rays are created by the portion of the ssc component at and below the break , as it gradually softens .",
    "this ssc - only model gives an adequate fit to the broadband sed , although it gives a poor fit to the lat data ( fig .",
    "[ 3c454.3sed ] ) , and does not produce a sharp break in the lat @xmath9-ray spectrum , although @xcite found that the lat spectrum could just as easily be fit by a smooth transition such as , for example , a power - law with an exponential cutoff .",

    "the portion of the _ fermi _ spectrum below the break is from compton scattering of a combination of direct accretion disk and blr - reprocessed radiation , while above the break it is almost entirely from compton scattering of blr - reprocessed disk photons .",
    "this model uses the full compton cross section for all compton calculations , and the full shakura - sunyaev disk spectrum for both direct and blr - reprocessed compton - scattered emission . for the compton - scattered blr calculation ,",
    "the shakura - sunyaev disk spectrum is assumed to originate from the black hole itself , whereas in the direct disk - scattered calculation , geometric effects are taken into account .    for kn effects to become important in compton scattering the blr radiation , @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the typical dimensionless energy of photons from the disk in the disk s stationary frame . for our model , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 ,",
    "so that @xmath126 . electrons with this energy scatter photons primarily to energies of @xmath127 which corresponds to frequencies of @xmath128 hz .",
    "thus above the break the compton scattering of the blr is almost entirely in the kn regime .",
    "since the kn cross section goes as approximately @xmath129 , @xmath130 should go as @xmath131 above the break in the @xmath9-ray spectrum .",
    "this is quite close to the @xmath132 which is observed by _",
    "fermi_. although the blr photons are thomson - scattered disk photons with essentially the same energy as the direct disk photons , geometric effects from doppler boosting and aberration make compton - scattered blr radiation peak at higher photon energies than the disk photons , which tend to come from behind .",

    "the sum of the particle and magnetic - field power @xmath136 is well below @xmath137 for @xmath138 ( the photon power is @xmath139 erg s@xmath5 ) .",
    "the model is close to equipartition between the total particle and magnetic - field energy densities , assuming a factor @xmath140 more energy in total nonthermal particles than electrons , i.e. , @xmath141 .",
    "our multi - component fit has lower jet power than the fit to the same sed by @xcite , due primarily to their assumption of a larger proton power , with @xmath142 .",
    "the @xmath9-ray spectral break observed with _",
    "fermi _ was constant over several month timescales @xcite .",
    "as the @xmath9-ray - emitting region moves outward , the spectral break should remain at approximately the same energy , since for @xmath119 , the blr- and disk - scattered flux should remain approximately equal .",
    "the overall @xmath9-ray flux will , of course , change over time , but as long as @xmath143 , and @xmath69 or @xmath68 does not change significantly , the @xmath9-ray spectral break should be present .    in @xcite ,",
    "optical observations are seen to vary with changes on the same magnitude as the @xmath9-rays .",
    "if the @xmath9-rays were produced by ssc emission , `` quadratic variability '' , i.e. , @xmath144 , might be expected .",
    "the absence of such variability is in accord with our spectral fitting results means that this model for 3c 454.3 is disfavored .    the x - ray light curve of shows little variability during this time , and is not correlated with the ir , optical , uv , or @xmath9-rays @xcite",
    "this can be explained by the longer cooling timescale ( see fig .",
    "[ cooltime ] ) .",
    "these timescale calculations use monochromatic approximations for the compton - scattered disk and blr components , but the full compton cross section for all components .",
    "the electrons which make the x - rays by ssc have lower energies than those that make the optical and @xmath9-rays , and thus cool more slowly than the observed variability timescale .",
    "the lack of correlated variability between x - rays and optical and @xmath9-rays might indicate that the x - rays originate from another part of the jet than the lat @xmath9-rays .",
    "however , in this case , the emission would still likely be in the fast cooling regime , since the @xmath9-ray flux is significantly greater than the optical and radio fluxes , and as long as one is in the fast cooling regime , compton scattering of a single component can not explain the lat spectrum .",
    "furthermore , during the 2007 november flares of 3c  454.3 , detected by _ swift _",
    "uvot , xrt and bat , _ integral _ , and _ agile _ , the x - rays were weakly variable , compared with other wavebands , but did seem to show correlated variability @xcite , which indicates they originate from the same emission region .",
    "one final possibility is that a hadronic model may be possible to explain the lat @xmath9-ray spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however , such models may have difficulties in explaining the correlated variability seen in this source , since protons would evolve on longer timescales than electrons .",
    "assuming the dual - component compton - scattering scenario presented in this paper is correct , what can it tell us about the location of the @xmath9-ray emission region ?",
    "it implies that this region is @xmath145 , so that , using the parameters from the modeling of 3c  454.3 , the location of the jet falls over a large range from @xmath146 .",
    "however , the external energy density from disk and blr radiations is @xmath117 , a steep decline , so that the blob must be within @xmath147 pc for a significant scattering component .",
    "recent modeling of 3c 454.3 @xcite also finds that the @xmath2-ray emitting region is within the blr .",
    "by contrast , @xcite suggested that the @xmath9-rays observed by egret and agile were caused by compton - scattering of radiation from hot dust by a blob located @xmath148 pc from the central black hole , though detailed modeling is still needed to determine if this model can explain the sharp spectral break in the _ fermi _ observations .",
    "the blazar 3c 279 also shows a similar spectral break during the onset of an extended episode of optical polarization , while the jet emission region could still be within the blr region @xcite .",
    "whether this model can predict similar spectral breaks in other fsrqs and low - synchrotron - peaked blazars , such as ao 0235 + 164 or pks 1502 + 106 @xcite , depends mainly on the properties of the blr in these sources , in particular , whether @xmath149 . in specific blazars , especially at higher @xmath46 , @xmath14-absorption by scattered disk radiation @xcite could still be effective .",
    "detailed modeling of simultaneous sed data will test these scenarios , as it does for the case of .",
    "if our model is correct , it provides evidence for a wind model of the blr @xcite .",
