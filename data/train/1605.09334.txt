    "the introduction of impurities in superconductors is a well known approach to probe the local response function and to unravel their intrinsic microscopic properties.@xcite both spinless and paramagnetic impurities perturb the local electronic environment and cause a significant change in the spin polarization around them . when the spin correlations are particularly enhanced , as it is the case in the proximity of a quantum critical point ( qcp),@xcite or when the amount of impurities starts to be significant , cooperative effects become relevant and marked changes in the superconducting transition temperature are observed , eventually leading to the appearance of a magnetic order.@xcite    in the pnictides extensive studies on the effect of impurities on the superconducting ground - state have been reported @xcite and the most dramatic and yet not fully understood effect is induced by mn for fe substitution in the optimally electron - doped lafeaso@xmath6f@xmath7.@xcite in this material it is sufficient to introduce a tiny amount of mn , as low as 0.2% , to fully quench superconductivity .",
    "it has been shown that at this doping level there is a divergence of the in - plane correlation length , characteristic of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) antiferromagnetically correlated metal approaching a quantum critical point.@xcite this qcp separates the superconducting phase from a magnetic ground - state developing at mn contents above 0.2% .",
    "originally it was suggested that mn impurities could lead to a shift in the spectral weight of the fluctuations from @xmath14 ( stripe wave - vector ) to @xmath15 ( nel wave - vector ) @xcite and accordingly to a suppression of interband pairing processes.@xcite however , no evidence of a nel phase in mn - doped lafeaso@xmath6f@xmath7 has been ever reported and recent experiments seem rather to suggest that the magnetic order is still characterized by a stripe collinear arrangement.@xcite it is interesting to notice that such a marked effect is observed for lafeaso@xmath6f@xmath7 only , whereas lnfeaso@xmath6f@xmath7 with smaller lanthanide ions ( e.g. for ln = sm ) shows a much less dramatic effect and much larger amounts of mn are needed to suppress superconductivity .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we present a study of the effect of mn doping in lafeaso@xmath6f@xmath7 where la is partially substituted by y , for doping levels up to 20 % . by combining muon spin rotation @xmath0sr with superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) magnetometry",
    "we were able to draw the phase diagram of la@xmath2y@xmath3fe@xmath4mn@xmath5aso@xmath6f@xmath7 , at fixed y content as a function of the mn doping level and at fixed mn doping as a function of the y doping level .",
    "it is shown that y doping causes a significant shift of the qcp observed in the @xmath16 system and that magnetism arises only for @xmath17 % , for @xmath11 % .",
    "@xmath1f nuclear spin - lattice relaxation measurements evidence the enhancement of low - frequency dynamics already present in the normal phase of the samples without mn .",

    "all the samples are optimally electron doped with a nominal fluorine content of 11% .",
    "the results obtained in the lay20 series will be compared to those already derived for lafe@xmath4mn@xmath28aso@xmath6f@xmath7 ( lay0 hereafter).@xcite it is pointed out that the lay0 series @xcite was not grown with exactly the same procedure as the lay20 series .",
    "although this may lead to slight changes in the phase diagram this will not affect the analysis and the conclusions presented in this work .",
    "the intensity of the @xmath1f nmr signal was measured at room temperature in order to check the effective fluorine content both for the lay20 and for the laymn05 series .",

    "[ fluorine ] show that the absolute fluorine stoichiometry is constant in each sample series within @xmath29 .      in a muon spin relaxation ( @xmath0sr ) experiment 100% spin - polarized positive muons ( @xmath30 ) are implanted uniformly into the sample .",
    "the @xmath31 muon spin acts as a magnetic probe , precessing around the local magnetic field @xmath32 at a frequency @xmath33 , where @xmath34 mhz / t is the muon gyromagnetic ratio .",
    "when the muons decay they emit a positron preferentially along the direction of their spins .",
    "hence , by counting the positrons emitted along a given direction one can reconstruct the time dependence of the muon decay asymmetry @xmath35 , proportional to the time evolution of the muon spin polarization.@xcite    in order to probe the local magnetic properties of la@xmath2y@xmath3fe@xmath4mn@xmath5aso@xmath6f@xmath7 , zero field ( zf ) and longitudinal field ( lf ) measurements were carried out at the paul sherrer institut ( psi ) with the dolly instrument of s@xmath0s facility .",
    "zf measurements are extremely sensitive to spontaneous magnetism since in this configuration the local field at the muon site originates from the internal magnetic order only . on the other hand ,",
    "lf measurements represent a useful tool to study the spin dynamics and can conveniently be used to distinguish between static and dynamic magnetism  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ asym ] shows the typical time dependence of the zf @xmath0sr asymmetry at different temperatures for the samples that display a magnetic order below @xmath36 .",
    "the time evolution of the muon asymmetry could be fit with the following standard function : @xmath37\\mbox { , } \\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the initial @xmath0sr asymmetry , while @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the longitudinal ( @xmath41 ) and transverse ( @xmath42 ) fractions of the asymmetry , respectively .",
    "the function @xmath43 determines the time dependence of the transverse component , whereas the longitudinal one decays exponentially with a decay rate @xmath44 .    at high temperature ( @xmath45 30 k ) the samples of the lay20 and laymn05 series are in the paramagnetic regime and the muon asymmetry can be fit by setting @xmath40=0 , with decay rates @xmath46 @xmath0s@xmath47 . upon decreasing the temperature",
    "a fast decaying component @xmath40 emerges in the lay20 samples with @xmath48% , evidencing the presence of overdamped oscillations in the muon asymmetry .",
    "a similar behavior is observed for samples close to the magnetic superconducting boundary @xcite and reflects the presence of a significant distribution of local magnetic fields , typically observed when a short range af magnetic order develops.@xcite the size of the internal fields is of the order of the field distribution @xmath49 , which can be roughly estimated as @xmath50 .",
    "the values of @xmath51 obtained from the fit of the data with eq .",

    "it can be shown that in a polycrystalline sample with 100% magnetic volume fraction @xmath55 and that in general one can write @xmath56 . the temperature dependence of @xmath54 ( fig .",
    "[ internal_field]b ) shows that the full magnetic volume condition is reached only at low temperatures for all the magnetically ordered samples ( lay20 with @xmath57 ) .",
    "the magnetic ordering temperature can be estimated by fitting @xmath58 to the error function @xmath59 which assumes the presence of a gaussian distribution of local transition temperatures centered around the average value @xmath36 .",
    "the results are reported in the phase diagram in fig .",

    "@xcite    the polycrystalline samples were milled to fine powders in order to improve the radiofrequency penetration .",
    "all the measurements were performed in a magnetic field of 1.36 t , in the temperature range between 4 k and 100 k. for a few selected samples the temperature range was extended up to 200 k to precisely estimate the high temperature @xmath1f @xmath12 trend .",
    "the @xmath1f spin lattice relaxation rate was estimated by fitting the recovery of the longitudinal magnetization @xmath62 after a saturation recovery pulse sequence .",
    "for all the samples the recovery could be nicely fit to a stretched exponential ( see fig .",

    "the stretching exponent progressively decreased on cooling below 100 k and it was found in the range @xmath66 for all samples ( see the inset to fig .",

    "this behaviour indicates the presence of a distribution of spin lattice relaxation times which is a common feature of disordered systems and in our case it is probably due to the different inequivalent impurity configurations resulting from y and mn doping .",
    "in fact , the low temperature values of @xmath65 get smaller on increasing the mn content , namely the number of impurities .    the temperature dependence of @xmath12 in lay20 , for mn contents ranging from @xmath67 up to @xmath68",
    ", is shown in fig .",
    "[ t1 ] . while at high temperature @xmath12 displays a linear korringa behavior ( see ref . ) typical of weakly correlated metals , below 80k the spin lattice relaxation rate progressively increases on cooling , giving rise to a broad peak around 25k .",
    "it is remarked that this increase starts well above t@xmath69 or well above t@xmath70 , for the magnetically ordered samples .",
    "insights on the nature of the peak can be gained by observing its evolution upon changing the magnitude of the external magnetic field @xmath71 .",
    "measurements in a lower field of 0.75 t revealed that while at high temperature @xmath12 is only weakly field dependent , the magnitude of the peak at 25 k is significantly enhanced,@xcite which is exactly the behaviour expected for slow dynamics with a characteristic frequency in the mhz range , close to the larmor frequency @xmath72 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath12 below 25  k depends on the mn doping level : in samples with mn doping below 10% the spin lattice relaxation rate decreases with lowering temperature , while for samples with higher mn doping we observed a steep increase of @xmath12 with a divergence at temperatures approaching the magnetic transition temperature determined by @xmath0sr .",
    "this behavior is associated with the critical divergence of the spin correlation length on approaching the magnetic transition , which yields a power law divergence of @xmath73 .",
    "further insights on the effects of mn doping can be gained from the study of the temperature dependence of the @xmath1f nmr linewidth @xmath74 , directly related to the amplitude of the staggered magnetization developing around the mn impurity@xcite .",
    "@xmath74 was derived from the fast fourier transform of half of the echo signal after a hahn spin - echo pulse sequence . as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fwhm ] by increasing the mn content a marked increase of @xmath74 is observed .",

    "about 80% of the second moment is due to f - la nuclear dipole interaction and about 19.5% to f - f interaction , while only a minor contribution arises from f - as interactions .",
    "this term practically does not change by increasing the mn doping since the lattice parameters change by less than 1.2% between @xmath19 and @xmath78% @xcite and the dipolar contribution of @xmath79mn nuclei for @xmath80% would cause a change by less than 1% of the linewidth .",

    "the results on lay20 , where la is partially substituted by the smaller but non - magnetic y ion , clearly evidence that the electronic properties of the lafeaso@xmath6f@xmath7 are significantly affected by the chemical pressure or strain induced by the different radii of the lanthanide ions on the feas planes .",

    "superconductivity , suppressed by the tiny quantity of 0.5% of mn for the end @xmath88 member , is gradually restored by increasing the y content or , in other terms , the chemical pressure .",
    "when superconductivity is fully suppressed a magnetic order arises both in the lay0 and in the lay20 series , as shown in fig .",
    "[ phase ] .",
    "this behavior suggests that the two orders are competing and that for lay0 a quantum critical point is separating the superconducting and magnetic phases , as supported by the previous@xcite analysis of the temperature dependence of the magnetic correlation length . on the other hand ,",
    "it should be pointed out that for lay20 a crossover region where both t@xmath69 and t@xmath70 are zero is observed for 4% @xmath89 6% .",
    "the onset of a magnetic order for just 0.2% of mn in lay0 indicates that in this compound significant electronic correlations must be present . if the ratio between hubbard repulsion and the hopping integral associated with the @xmath90-th band @xmath91 is sizeable , a significant enhancement of the local spin susceptibility occurs.@xcite in the iron - based superconductors quite different behaviours may be observed for the electrons in the five bands crossing the fermi level and hund s coupling may even lead to orbital selective mott transitions.@xcite however , for simplicity in the following discussion we will consider that in lafeaso@xmath6f@xmath7 the behaviour can be described by an average value of @xmath92 . if @xmath92 is close to a critical value leading to charge localization , the amplitude and the extension of the spin polarization around the mn impurity significantly increase with respect to a weakly correlated metal@xcite and even a tiny amount of impurities may drive the system towards a magnetic ground - state .",
    "hence , the undoped lafeaso@xmath6f@xmath7 superconductor must be very close to a qcp since a significant change in the electronic properties occurs by perturbing the system with tiny mn amounts .",
    "this aspect is further supported by the charge localization observed in the lay0 for mn contents above @xmath85 and by the significant changes in the @xmath93 axis lattice parameter.@xcite moreover , as we have previously mentioned , we found that the behaviour of the spin correlation length is that expected for a two - dimensional antiferromagnet close to a qcp . @xcite",
    "hence the quenching of superconductivity should not be ascribed to a pair breaking effect , where the suppression of superconductivity yields the recovery of the normal metallic state , but to a quantum phase transition affecting the lay0 electronic ground - state .",
    "the increase in the chemical pressure induced by y doping causes an increase in the metallic character and a decrease in @xmath92 .",
    "accordingly , the spin polarization around the mn impurity is reduced and larger mn contents are needed to induce a magnetic order which , in any case , appears to be characterized by an order parameter which is weaker than that observed in the lay0 system ( fig .  [ phase ] ) .",
    "however , the behaviour of the lay0 and lay20 series becomes similar ( see the inset of fig .",
    "[ phasey ] ) once the phase diagram is rescaled by the critical mn content @xmath85 and the superconducting transition temperature for t@xmath94 .",
    "namely the mn doping level @xmath85 yielding the quantum critical point is renormalized by the decrease in @xmath92 .",
    "further insights on the effect of mn in lay0 and lay20 can be derived from the analysis of the @xmath1f nmr spin - lattice relaxation rate . as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ t1 ] a broad peak in @xmath12 , which is increasing with the mn content , is detected around 25 k. that peak , observed both in the lay0 and in the lay20 series , is a very general feature of these systems since it is present both in superconducting and magnetic samples and also in the sample without mn doping,@xcite although slightly shifted to lower temperatures .",
    "the introduction of increasing mn contents gives rise to a progressive enhancement of the peak magnitude , suggesting that the presence of paramagnetic impurities strengthens the low - frequency dynamics already present in the pure compound .",
    "its dependence on the magnetic field intensity @xcite indicates that it has to be associated with low - frequency fluctuations ( mhz range ) .",

    "this distribution is nearly constant and affected by the disorder induced by the large amount of y introduced in the system .",
    "the most significant change is the increase in the amplitude of the local fluctuating field @xmath119 with @xmath13 , which indicates that the strength of the local spin susceptibility in the feas plane becomes progressively enhanced by mn doping .",

    "[ fwhm ] ) , which is directly related to the amplitude of the staggered magnetization developing around the impurity .",
    "the results , summarized in table .  [ tab : curie ] , show that both the curie constant and the curie - weiss temperature increase as a function of mn , indicating that the insertion of mn strengthens the spin correlations .",
