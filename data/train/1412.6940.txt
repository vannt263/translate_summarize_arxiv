    "thin plate and shell - like structures are ubiquitous in nature , arising in such instances as leaves and petals in plants to heart valves and epithelial tissues in organisms .",
    "they are also used in engineering and technological applications that range from flexible electronic circuits to prosthetic tissue engineered valves valves , to large scale mechanical and civil structures .",
    "a basic mathematical model that is used to describe and predict the mechanical behavior of these thin structures has its origins in elastic plate theory @xcite having been well - studied for over a century .",
    "most studies examine how the plate behaves in response to external and internal stimuli .",
    "these stimuli include not only forces applied to the surfaces and edges of the plate , but also more general effects such as thermal expansion , swelling , plastic deformation , and volumetric growth . while this forward problem remains a rich area of investigation in the mathematical , physical and engineering sciences , a natural question concerns the inverse problem of design",
    " how can we create optimal thin plate and shell - like structures for specific functions ?",
    "since shape is a precursor to function in many situations including the examples above , the simplest such inverse problem is that of asking how to shape a plate using boundary or bulk strains induced by external constraints or inhomogeneous growth .",
    "here we examine just this inverse problem : given a target shape that we want the plate to attain , how should the external or internal stimuli ( henceforth `` control variables '' ) be chosen so that the plate is deformed into the target shape ?    early work on optimization of plate shape using boundary constraints includes studies focused on using normal traction on the plate surface to change its shape @xcite . however , while they were optimizing for a specific target configuration for the plate , their target was characterized by specifying both the normal displacement field @xmath0 and the airy stress function @xmath1 .",
    "this formulation is unnecessarily restrictive as a certain target _ shape _ for the deformed plate can be provided by many combinations of @xmath0 and the in - plane displacements @xmath2 , @xmath3 ( which are linked to @xmath1 ) along the boundary .",
    "recently , a new twist to this problem was added as a number of different groups have realized the ability to incorporate inelastic effects such as volumetric growth into elastic plate theory , a subject that has recently attracted much interest @xcite .",
    "one area of particular interest is the imposition of inhomogeneous growth strains .",
    "these give rise to residual stresses which are relieved by the plate s buckling out of plane .",
    "this can be seen at the edges of certain leaves and flowers @xcite , which can have a rippled configuration due to inhomogeneous growth .",
    "analogously , irreversible plastic deformation causes ripples at the edge of torn sheets of plastic .",
    "it is also possible to shape elastic plates made of gels and other polymeric materials that can swell by imbibing fluids @xcite . by blocking the ability of certain parts of the plate to swell or causing the plate to swell inhomogeneously ,",
    "it is then possible to cause the plate to assume a variety of different shapes . in particular , these inhomogenous strains and boundary conditions cause the plate to deform , primarily by bending out of the plane , since that mode of deformation is usually inexpensive . that this is indeed possible in a controllable way",
    "was shown recently @xcite by analytically characterizing a class of in - plane volumetric growth that can transform an originally flat plate assuming certain symmetries in the shape , and then validated experimentally .    here ,",
    "we complement and generalize this idea to the case of using either boundary and bulk forcing and either in - plane or out - of - plane growth that can lead to variations in the natural curvature , all of which can be inhomogeneous .",
    "our aim then is to find the growth strains so that this buckling  and other growth - dependent deformations  cause the reference plate shape to achieve a given target shape by balancing the requirements of closeness to the target while at the same time not having large inhomogeneities in the growth strain field ( which are typically hard to engineer in technology or control in biology )",
    ".    our analysis will be more general than the specific instances outlined above in that we will develop a numerical method for arbitrary target shapes , and also consider not just in - plane growth but also active changes of curvature ( caused by growth which is greater at one side of the plate than the other ) .",
    "the equations for growing plates are described in section [ sect - growth - eqs ] , and the optimization process ( structurally similar to the work of jones and pereira @xcite that was started after this work was underway , but submitted earlier ) is explained in section [ sect - main - theory ] . following this",
    "we solve the system numerically for a general non - symmetric configuration ( section [ sect-2d ] ) , and for simplified one - dimensional ( section [ sect-1d ] ) and axisymmetric ( section [ sect - axi ] ) geometries .",
    "finally , in section [ sect - simple ] we use a semi - analytic approach on a circular disk to investigate how axisymmetric growth can give rise to so - called soft deformation modes .",
    "the equations governing volumetric growth in plates can be derived from one of two equivalent viewpoints :  either by changing the definition of the reference metric , or by decomposing the strain tensors into growth and accommodation components . in the first approach",
    ", the reference metric of the plate is changed from its usual euclidean form to a prescribed non - euclidean metric .",
    "if a plate can be visualized as a collection of evenly - spaced points in a plane , connected by springs with a constant rest length , then imposing a non - euclidean metric is equivalent to changing the spring rest lengths in such a way that a stress - free planar configuration of the points is impossible .",
    "this is kinematically equivalent to imposing an inhomogeneous in - plane growth field .",
    "thus , a plate with an imposed non - euclidean metric will tend to buckle out of plane in order to minimize its stored energy  as long as the applied strains are sufficiently large . a second approach to this problem",
    "is to consider the elastic growth process directly , and to derive the equation in the limit of small strain and small plate thickness .",
    "this leads to very similar equations albeit approached from different perspectives  from a differential geometric perspective @xcite , and formal perturbation theory @xcite , @xcite , and bear deep similarities to the equations written down nearly half a century ago by mansfield @xcite for the thermoelastic deformations for plates . in all cases , the nonlinear growth in an elastic body",
    "is kinematically described by a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient but in the plate limit the growth becomes an additive contribution to the strain fields . in this section",
    "we will present the main equations , modified to account for varying plate thickness .",
    "growth is not the only phenomenon that can be described using this formalism ; both thermoelastic expansion and plastic deformation are also kinematically described ( especially in the small - thickness limit of plate theory ) by additive decompositions of the strain tensors .",
    "the difference between these three theories is of course in how the non - elastic part ( growth , thermal expansion , plastic deformation ) is described , and in how these effects alter the properties of the material ( including material density , stiffness tensors , and porosity ) .",
    "we will assume that the non - elastic parts of the strain tensor are small , so that these higher - order effects can be neglected .    with this in mind",
    ", we define a plate using cartesian coordinates @xmath4 , with its deformation characterized by the in - plane displacements @xmath5 and out - of - plane displacement @xmath6 , where greek indices vary over @xmath7 .",
    "the growth in the plate may be characterized by the growth strains @xmath8 and @xmath9 , such that the in - plane strain @xmath10 and the change - of - curvature tensor @xmath11 may be additively decomposed into growth and accommodation components : @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "this decomposition is valid if the strain fields remain small . in terms of displacement",
    "the elastic accommodation strain tensors are thus given by @xmath14 and an index preceded by a comma indicates differentiation with respect to that coordinate .",
    "the elastic energy density is given by @xmath15 ( applying the summation convention ) , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the young s modulus , poisson ratio and thickness of the plate respectively .",
    "we scale the displacements @xmath20 and @xmath0 with @xmath21 , a typical lengthscale of the problem ; @xmath9 with @xmath22 ; the variable thickness @xmath19 with typical value @xmath23 , leading to typical values @xmath24 , @xmath25 for the stiffnesses .",

    "thus an extra step would be needed to calculate @xmath2 and @xmath3 from @xmath1 before measuring the distance between the deformed plate and the target shape .",
    "an alternative to this approach is to write the system explicitly in terms of the three displacement components @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath0 .",

    "this is because in the pinned case , the plate can leverage the fixed displacements at the edges to buckle out of plane into the target shape , whereas with the free boundary condition the structure does not have this freedom ( at least in one dimension ) and must actively bend through @xmath118 to achieve the shape . indeed , solving the fvk equations directly with the calculated solution in figure [ 1d - results](c ) yields a bistable configuration characteristic of buckling :  the plate can achieve both the target shape and an inverted solution , much like an euler column ( although in this case the two states have different energies , due to the asymmetry introduced through @xmath118 ) .",

    "we can clearly see that increasing @xmath161 makes the distributions of @xmath117 and @xmath118 smoother , and this is particularly noticeable when we impose @xmath151 .",
    "the greatest difference between the solutions with and without the assumption @xmath151 , is that if @xmath162 then the solutions are almost entirely due to a constant @xmath118 field :  as we had predicted , the free boundary conditions mean that the plate needs to actively bend to the desired shape .",

    "the change of curvature term @xmath118 is positive , while for profile 2 it becomes negative .",
    "we would expect the negative constant @xmath118 to also give a paraboloidal shape , but it transpires that this state is bistable :  a mechanical eversion gives rise to the desired profile 2 . on the other hand , if @xmath118 is set to zero , then the negative gaussian curvature at the rim of profile 2 is introduced by increasing the growth strains here .",
    "liang and mahadevan @xcite analyzed modified versions of the equations ( [ fvk1])([fvk2 ] ) in order to demonstrate how a blooming flower can be regarded as a mechanical phenomenon caused by buckling due to differential growth strains .",
    "this analysis was enabled by analyzing a simplified shell geometry considered representative of the actual petal shape .",
    "mansfield @xcite also investigated this system  a circular plate with zero @xmath8 and constant isotropic @xmath35 due to an applied temperature gradient  and showed that initially the deformed plate was a spherical cap .",
    "however , at a certain critical value of @xmath118 , this solution became unstable and bifurcated to a nonsymmetric shape similar to a section of a cylinder .",
    "this result illustrates the phenomenon of a soft mode , or a zero - stiffness deformation mode .",
    "specifically , while the deformation field is nonaxisymmetric , the underlying mechanical properties of the material ( undeformed shape , stiffness , growth fields ) are independent of angle ( _ i.e. _  axisymmetric ) .",
    "thus the same non - axisymmetric deformation , rotated by an arbitrary angle , is also a solution of the system , with the same stored energy .",
    "this one - parameter family of solutions is known as a soft mode .",
    "the ability of such structures to change shape without the requirement of large energy input has given them both theoretical and practical importance , with applications ranging from actuators to deployable structures @xcite .",
    "mansfield s bifurcation was reproduced experimentally by lee @xcite , where a flat disc comprising two layers of unequal thermal expansion coefficient was heated , corresponding to the imposition of a constant field @xmath118 was imposed . under a large enough temperature ,",
    "the initially axisymmetric shape buckled to mansfield s nonaxisymmetric soft mode .",
    "other soft modes have also been developed experimentally , notably by guest @xcite , who created a zero - stiffness elastic shell by plastically deforming a metallic plate to a shell with a cylindrical geometry .",
    "taking mansfield s work as our starting point , we will simplify the normal displacements and growth functions to be quadratic functions of position , and use our optimization technique to solve for the coefficients of these functions , rather than for their full pointwise distribution .",
    "we will show that the near - cylindrical geometry of mansfield is not the only soft mode achievable by the application of axisymmetric growth functions .",
    "these solutions are a special case of the solutions found by seffen and maurini @xcite ; our results emphasize the neutrally - stable nature of the deformations .",
    "the first difficulty one encounters when performing an analysis on such a simplified deformation ansatz is that the boundary conditions will not , in general , be satisfied . to remedy this",
    "we must assume a specific form for the variable thickness .",
    "in particular , if the plate is circular , with radius @xmath68 , set the thickness to be @xmath163 .",
    "because of the dependence of the bending and stretching stiffnesses @xmath164 and @xmath165 on @xmath19 , we find that the in - plane stress resultants and moment resultants tend to zero as @xmath166 , so that the boundary conditions are now automatically satisfied . additionally , with simple forms of the dependent variables , a solution may be found to the fvk equations ( [ fvk1])([fvk2 ] ) .",
    "for instance , for a circular plate of ( dimensionless ) radius @xmath68 , set @xmath167 where we have assumed isotropic growth .",
    "we have hereby reduced the problem to determining the seven constants @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 , and @xmath174 by minimizing the objective function @xmath112 subject to the fvk equation constraints . considering the constraints first ,",
    "the stress - free boundary conditions for this system are satisfied automatically . on substituting ( [ ansatz1])([ansatz3 ] ) into the fvk equations ( [ fvk1])([fvk2 ] ) ,",
    "we obtain the following relations between the coefficients : @xmath175    the remaining three degrees of freedom are set by minimizing the objective function @xmath112 . since @xmath176 , @xmath177 and hence @xmath178 .",
    "however , for this application the smoothness of @xmath117 is not relevant and we set @xmath179 , so that @xmath180 .    to calculate @xmath64 , we need the full displacement field , including the in - plane displacements @xmath181 in the radial direction and @xmath182 in the circumferential direction .",
    "these are given by @xmath183 the expression for @xmath182 does not lend itself well to a simple distance function which may be integrated over the area of the circular plate . however , we may approximate a distance function by calculating the arclength distance measure ( [ arclength - distance ] ) for @xmath184 ( which is where @xmath185 ) , and summing the results : @xmath186    we can now state the optimization problem for this simplified formulation ( f1 ) : choose @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 , @xmath174 , @xmath170 that minimize @xmath64 , subject to equations ( [ semianalytic - constr-1])([semianalytic - constr-3 ] ) .",
    "we will now illustrate this method by considering the growth patterns required to transform the circular plate to the targets outlined earlier .",
    "we consider an axisymmetric profile @xmath187 , a cylindrical profile @xmath188 ( as an approximation to mansfield s bifurcated solution ) and a saddle geometry @xmath189 .    substituting these target shapes into the optimization procedure will output the values of the constants . however , by exploiting symmetry to write @xmath174 in terms of @xmath173 , we can find @xmath170 , @xmath169 and @xmath172 in terms of @xmath173 from ( [ semianalytic - constr-1])([semianalytic - constr-3 ] ) , and then @xmath168 and @xmath173 are calculated by minimizing the distance functional @xmath64 .",
    "for the paraboloid of revolution @xmath187 , @xmath190 and equation ( [ semianalytic - constr-2 ] ) is automatically satisfied .",
    "the optimization thus has an extra degree of freedom .",
    "however , the solution obtained has @xmath170 much greater than both @xmath168 and @xmath169 , making it comparable with mansfield s original solution with @xmath191 .",
    "in fact , setting @xmath192 we obtain his result exactly : @xmath193 however this result , as noted previously , becomes unstable when @xmath194 .",
    "figure [ mansfield - bifurcation ] displays the bifurcation diagram for the parameters @xmath173 , @xmath174 as @xmath170 varies",
    ".     increases past a critical value , the axisymmetric solution ( @xmath195 ) becomes unstable , and a solution with @xmath196 emerges .",

    "@xmath198 in both cases , @xmath168 and @xmath173 are found by minimizing @xmath64 .",
    "note the similarity between these results and those of section [ sect - axi ] , where a paraboloidal bowl was found for @xmath199 , or for @xmath151 and an in - plane growth which may be approximated by @xmath200 , as here .    for a cylindrical target shape , @xmath201 ( as opposed to mansfield s bifurcated solution , which had both @xmath173 and @xmath174 positive ) .",
