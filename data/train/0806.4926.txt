    "electron - positron pair production from vacuum in the presence of strong electromagnetic fields is one of the most intriguing non - linear phenomena in qed of outstanding importance specially nowadays where high intensity lasers are available for experimental verification ( for a concise review see greiner , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the theoretical treatment of this phenomenon can be traced back to klein @xcite , sauter@xcite , heisenberg and euler@xcite but it was schwinger @xcite that first thoroughly examined this phenomenon , often called schwinger mechanism .",
    "schwinger implementing the proper time method obtained the conditions under which pair production is possible : the invariant quantities @xmath1 , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xmath5 are the electromagnetic field tensor and its dual respectively , must be such that neither @xmath6 , @xmath7 ( case of plane wave field ) nor @xmath8 , @xmath9 ( pure magnetic field ) .",
    "for the case of a static spacially uniform electric field ( where @xmath10 , @xmath9 ) he obtained a nonperturbative result for the probability @xmath11 for a pair to be created per unit volume and unit time to be @xmath12 .",
    "however in order to have sizable effects the electric field strength @xmath13  must exceed the _ critical value _",
    "@xmath14 @xmath15 .",
    "brezin and itzykson @xcite  examined the case of pair creation in the presence of a pure oscillating electric field @xmath16 ( the presence of such electric field only can be achieved by using two oppositely propagating laser beams so that in the antinodes of the standing wave formed @xmath10 and pair production can occur ) by applying a version of wkb approximation and treating the problem in an analogous way as in the ionization of atoms(where the three basic mechanisms multiphoton , tunneling and over the barrier ionization are present ) , considering the pairs as bound in vacuum with binding energy @xmath17 .",
    "the probability per 4-compton volume of @xmath18 pair creation is given by @xmath19where @xmath20  and the parameter @xmath21",
    "@xmath22(photon  energy / work  of@xmath23 in  a@xmath24 ) is the equivalent of the keldysh parameter in the ionization of atoms .",
    "the formula for @xmath25 interpolates between two physically important regimes . for @xmath26 ( high electric field strength and low frequency ) ,",
    "@xmath27 , @xmath25 @xmath28 and thus the adiabatic non - perturbative tunneling mechanism dominates .",
    "when @xmath13 @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "for @xmath31 ( low electric field strength and high frequency ) , @xmath32 and @xmath25 @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "this power - law behavior of @xmath25 in the external field @xmath13 , is indicative of typical multiphoton processes of order @xmath35 @xmath36 and @xmath25 corresponds to the n - th order perturbation theory in @xmath13 , n being the minimum number of  photons to create a pair .",
    "soon after the work of  brezin and itzykson , in the work of popov @xcite ( see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite ) using the imaginary time method , the results of @xcite ( and @xcite ) were confirmed and investigated further by determining also the pre exponential factor in @xmath25 taking in to account interference effects and treating again the system in analogous way as in the ionization of atoms . in particular , with @xmath37 being the pulse duration and @xmath38 the electromagnetic wavelength , it was shown in popov1 that for a spacially uniform oscillating electric field @xmath39 with frequency @xmath40 and under the conditions @xmath13 @xmath41 , @xmath42 @xmath43 ( which are both satisfied from present laser technology ) the probabilities over a compton 4-volume @xmath44 , can be obtained for any value of @xmath45 as a sum of probabilities @xmath46 of multiphoton processes of order @xmath47 : @xmath48 .",
    "for the exact rather lengthy formula of @xmath46 , which depends on @xmath21 , @xmath49 we refer the reader to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in the case",
    "@xmath50 the spectrum of @xmath51 of the @xmath47-photon processes is practically continuous giving the non - perturbative result @xmath52 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however in the typical multiphoton ( and of perturbative nature ) case @xmath31 , @xmath53 where @xmath54 .",
    "the number of pairs created in the two regimes are given by ( see @xcite ) @xmath55one can easily see by comparing the above results that the multiphoton processes are by far more efficient for pair production .",
    "treatment of schwinger mechanism for non - oscillating electric fields and time dependent magnetic fields see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , niki2 , @xcite . for the role of temporal and spacial inhomogeneities in the nonperturbative branch of pair production see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "on the other hand the first experimental verification of @xmath56 pair production took place at slac ( e-144 experiment)@xcite where a combination of nonlinear compton scattering and multiphoton breit - wheeler mechanism allowed for @xmath57 @xmath58 pair production to occur since the available electric field intensities in the area of interaction of the back - scattered photons with the laser used to produced them reached the necessary values .",
    "the number of positrons measured in 21962 laser pulses was 175@xmath59 and the multiphoton order of the process was found to be @xmath60 , in very good agreement with the theory .",
    "this experiment has led to a resent interest of the subject especially as to whether modern laser technology can produce the strong electric field required for experimental verification .",
    "as explicitly analyzed by ringwald @xcite both for the generalized wkb or imaginary time methods , the optical laser technology available @xcite , as far as power densities and electric fields concerns , does not seem to be implementable for experimental verification of @xmath56 pair creation , while for the x - ray free electron laser ( xfel ) should be a very promising facility ( see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however in a recent paper avetissian et al @xcite treated the problem of @xmath56 production in a standing wave of oppositely directed laser beams of plane transverse linearly polarized electromagnetic waves of frequency @xmath40 and wavelength @xmath38 , using a two level multiphoton on resonant approximation . as was shown there and qualitatively argued in @xcite this approach",
    "if experimentally implemented will result in much higher  @xmath56 production rate for the case of conventional femto - second lasers systems .",
    "the main difference of this approach to the one mentioned above is the resonance condition .",
    "also , since the fundamental parameter of the theory is @xmath61 , the results of this method can only be compared with the corresponding ones from the perturbative multiphoton regime @xmath62 above .",
    "the aim of this article is to investigate further this approximation mainly focusing on numerical computations that convincingly support the possibility of experimentally detectable pair creation with available optical laser technology .",
    "of special interest is the use of higher harmonics such as 3@xmath63 and 5@xmath40 .",
    "moreover the close resemblance of this approximation with multiphoton ionization of  atoms highlights a lot of the physically interesting characteristics that one might expect to detect in the laboratory .",
    "in particular , ultrashort laser systems such as nd - yag or ti - sapphire , with an intensity at the fundamental frequency @xmath40 , of the order of 10@xmath64 , when working on the multiphoton on resonant regime , is shown to produce number of pairs of the order of 10@xmath65 or more per laser shot . on the other hand such laser systems , with intensities up to the order of 10@xmath66 , can provide higher harmonics pair creation , such as 3@xmath40 and 5@xmath40 , where the number of pairs is shown to reach up to 10@xmath0 per laser shot . as is demonstrated one can keep the frequency fixed and gradually change the electric field strength , and perform that for each frequency chosen .",
    "however for the laser systems under consideration it is difficult to adjust @xmath13 while being on resonant and moreover there are limitations on the increase of it as will be shown .",
    "what is experimentally viable is to increase the frequency and , without having to focus in the diffraction limit , increase the intensity so that the resulting increase in @xmath13 will be such that the ratio @xmath67  is fixed . in section two",
    "we briefly present the results of @xcite referring the reader to that article for their derivation . in section three",
    "we investigate the behavior of the probability density and the number of pair created by the fundamental and higher harmonics of a conventional laser with respect to changes in the electric field strength and the energy spectrum of the created electrons(positron ) .",
    "we end this section by showing that there exist bounds on the values of the electric field strength , the multiphoton order and the energy spectrum for the two level on resonant multiphoton approximation to hold . finally in section four",
    "we conclude with suggested ways of experimental verification and future line of research .",
    "all numerical results have been produce for an nd - yag laser of photon energy @xmath68 and intensity 1.35@xmath69 and using mathematica and maple packages .",
    "following @xcite a standing wave @xmath70 is formed by two oppositely propagating laser beams of frequency @xmath40 and wavelength @xmath38 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "pair production essentially occurs close to the antinodes and in spacial dimensions @xmath71",
    "@xmath72 so that @xmath73  is very small and thus the spacial dependence of the resulting wave can be disregarded , that is @xmath74 . moreover since the interaction hamiltonian is of the form @xmath75 the most significant contribution in the pair creation process in the regions of antinodes will be at the direction along the electric field . due to space homogeneity in these regions the 4-momentum of a particle is conserved , transitions occur between two energy levels from @xmath76 to @xmath77 by the absorption of @xmath47 photons and the multiphoton probabilities will have maximum values for resonant transitions @xmath78non - linear solutions of the dirac equation under these conditions were obtained resulting to the following probability for an n - photon @xmath56 pair creation , summed over the spin states @xmath79where @xmath80@xmath81 is the relativistic invariant parameter given by , @xmath82@xmath83 and @xmath84 is the rabi frequency of the dirac vacuum at the interaction with a periodic electromagnetic field and respectively given by , @xmath85@xmath86  is the angle between the momentum of @xmath87 and @xmath88 , @xmath89 is the amplitude of the electric filedstrength of one incident wave , @xmath90 is the detuning of resonance , and @xmath37 is the interaction time . in obtaining the above probability",
    "it has been assumed without loss of generality that @xmath91 since there is a symmetry with respect to the direction of @xmath88 ( taken to be the oy axis ) and thus @xmath92 . as usual in applying the resonance approximation on a two level system the probability amplitudes are slow varying functions which is equivalently expressed here by the condition in ( [ rabi ] ) , corresponding to such field intensities for which the condition in ( [ ksi ] ) is satisfied .",
    "for short interaction time i.e. when @xmath93 , @xmath94 and the differential probability per unit time summed over the spin states in the phase - space volume @xmath95  is @xmath96 which after integration over the @xmath57(@xmath58 ) energy , the angular distribution of a n - photon differential probability of the created @xmath97 , @xmath58 pair , per unit time in unit space volume ( @xmath98 ) , on exact resonance is given by : @xmath99where @xmath100 .",
    "the total angular distribution of probability is @xmath101  ( where @xmath102 is the threshold number of photons for the pair production process to occur ) and integrating over the solid angle we obtain the total probability per unit time in unit space volume of the @xmath57 , @xmath103 pair production @xmath104 as : @xmath105where @xmath106 .",
    "the total number of pairs @xmath107 created for a given laser characteristics can be estimated by ( see avetissian ) @xmath108where @xmath109 is the space - volume , @xmath110 is the cross section radius , @xmath111 as stated above and @xmath37 is the interaction time . for focused optical lasers in the diffraction limit @xmath112 @xmath113 and @xmath114 . for the investigation that will follow @xmath115is the angular distribution of the number of pairs created from an @xmath47-photon process and @xmath116is the number of pairs created from that process",
    "as can be seen from section ii a basic role in the physical interpretation of the numerical computations that will follow , is played by the function @xmath117 ( rabi frequency on exact resonance ) , as the probabilities and number of produced pairs obtained are heavily depend on its behavior ( see ( wn1arm ) , ( [ dwndoarm ] ) ) . for a given value of the @xmath81 and @xmath47 , as can be seen from ( [ fn ] ) , @xmath118 and all derived angular dependent quantities in the above section , maximizes at @xmath119 and this is true for every @xmath81 and @xmath47 .",
    "consequentially we shall concentrate our analysis at this angle of observation of created pairs .",
    "not only this simplifies the numerics that will be presented below but also helps to clarify the behavior of this approximation in particular as far as future experimental verification . from now on @xmath120 and @xmath121 should be explicitly stated in the formulas . on exact resonance , @xmath47",
    "is given by ( see [ res1 ] ) @xmath122where we have expressed the energy @xmath77 of the created electron ( positron ) in terms of its rest energy as @xmath123 .",
    "thus @xmath124 characterizes the spectrum of the created pairs . at @xmath119 , a suitable expression for @xmath125 , @xmath117 , can be obtained from ( [ fn ] ) with @xmath123 , @xmath126 , and using the asymptotic behavior of the bessel function  @xmath127 at @xmath128 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , as can be seen from ( [ res ] ) for optical lasers where @xmath40 is very small ( of the order of @xmath129 ) , @xmath47 is very large and as @xmath130 , the argument of the bessel function in ( [ fn ] ) , which now becomes @xmath131 , is also very large and of the same order as @xmath47 , not mentioning bessel s extreme sensitivity on @xmath81 too .",

    "consequentially , for given values of @xmath259 we can quit sufficiently estimate the applicability of the present approximation by numerically computing the upper bounds @xmath260 of @xmath81 , using @xmath261 ( of course we could also keep @xmath262 fixed and numerically compute @xmath124 , but for experimental reasons , we are merely interested in the maximum applicable @xmath209 for the present approximation to hold ) . in fig.[fig5 ]     of @xmath242 as a function of @xmath124 for the cases @xmath166 ( top curve ) , @xmath164 ( middle curve ) and @xmath170 ( bottom curve).,width=623 ]    we plot the maximum admissible values @xmath260 of @xmath81 ( or @xmath209 ) as a function of @xmath124 ( and thus of @xmath47 ) , for the three cases @xmath40 , 3@xmath63 and 5@xmath40 where computations have been performed using @xmath263 for @xmath175 , @xmath264 ( @xmath265 respectively ) , @xmath188 and @xmath266 .",
    "the  factor @xmath267 in @xmath252 is justified by the approach adopted to increase the laser intensity in order to increase @xmath246 , rather than going to the diffraction limit ( @xmath268 ) to increase it , as this would be experimentally tedious when going to higher harmonics @xmath269 , where @xmath270 @xmath271 . from the curves of fig.[fig5 ]",
    "the range of the applicable on resonant multiphoton processes can easily be read off via the range of values of @xmath124 shown and using ( [ res ] ) . moreover the maximum applicable values of @xmath81 ( and thus via ( [ ksi ] ) of @xmath209 ) for each one of them can also be read off . points ( @xmath124 , @xmath260 ) for @xmath272 are unacceptable for the two level on resonant approximation of pair production . also because of the existence of @xmath260 for each @xmath124 ( and @xmath47 ) points in the log - plots of figs [ fig3],[fig4](a , b ) , where @xmath273 should be disregarded , and thus the curves for these plots should be terminated at @xmath255 or equivalently at @xmath274 .",
    "that is also why crossing points can not be present in the log - plots .",
    "as an example of the above consider the three peak points of the curves @xmath63 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 in fig.[fig2](a ) .",
    "the @xmath152 values of these points are situated close to the bottom of the corresponding curves of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] from which we can infer their corresponding @xmath260s to be approximately @xmath275 , @xmath276 , @xmath277 .",
    "moreover as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig4](a , b ) , when @xmath81 approaches @xmath260 the number of pairs created for the corresponding @xmath151 multiphoton processes reaches a maximum value .",
    "this explains the choices of @xmath81 chosen in the above numerical computations to be close to @xmath260 .",
    "consequentially points ( @xmath81 , @xmath203 ) in figs [ fig3 ] , [ fig4](a , b ) with values of @xmath273 _ should not _ be taken in to account .",
    "another important consequence of the upper bound @xmath260 , concerns the value of @xmath238 chosen when examining the spectrum of created pairs , for fixed @xmath278 , via plots of fig.[fig2](a , b ) . for simplicity",
    "consider @xmath279 . in fig.[fig3 ] the three terminal points of these curves , which maximize @xmath184 , corresponds to the points ( 1.41 , 0.99957 ) , ( @xmath280 , 0.99956 ) , ( 1.42 , 0.99959 ) of the @xmath40-curve of fig.[fig5 ] , ( @xmath280 , 0.99956 ) being the lowest point of it .",
    "if one chooses to work with an @xmath2810.99956 , say @xmath2820.99959 , then fig.[fig3 ] shows that energies with @xmath283 can never be observed .",
    "however plots such as fig.[fig2](a ) with @xmath2840.99959 can be drawn showing that points with values of @xmath124 in the physically forbidden range do contribute in @xmath184 .",
    "obviously this is a completely unphysical situation and should be taken care in experimental verification of plots such as fig.[fig2](a , b ) .",
    "in fact the only consistent value of @xmath81 is the one of the lowest point ( @xmath285 , @xmath286 ) of the @xmath287-curve of fig.fig5 as this guarantees both observability of all energies around @xmath288 as given in fig.[fig2](a , b ) and maximization of @xmath184 for this @xmath152 .",
    "from the above analysis  it is evident that present ultrashort laser technology seems to suffices in order to experimentally verify the validity of @xmath289 pair production from vacuum using a two level on resonance multiphoton approximation . in particular ,",
    "emphasis has been given in the implementation of higher harmonics such as 3@xmath40 and 5@xmath40 while the electric field strengths required , are obtained by increasing the laser energy rather than focusing to the diffraction limit .",
    "this improves the model in various advantageous ways .",
    "the need of higher harmonics is dictated by the limitation imposed by the upper value of electric field @xmath173 of the fundamental due to the condition @xmath290 . in order to work with @xmath130 but increase the @xmath89 higher @xmath40 values are necessarily .",
    "firstly , as shown in figs [ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] , the range of the created spectrum widens and the maximum number of pairs created increases drastically reaching @xmath29110@xmath0 pairs per laser shot for 5@xmath40 while , because of the resonant condition , the electric fields needed are low @xmath209 @xmath292 , compared with other multiphoton approximations such as the one leading to ( [ pop2 ] ) . in fact this is mainly why there is no need to focus in the diffraction limit to achieve such electric fields as present laser energies and achievable power can provide them .",
    "secondly the confirmation of the power law behavior of the number of pairs created as a function of electric field strength , typical of multiphoton processes , is demonstrated by figs [ fig3 ] , [ fig4 ] , showing again a drastic increase of @xmath184 in higher harmonics .",
    "however such log - plots can not probably be subjected to experimental verification since the range of  change of @xmath209 is very small and thus difficult if not technically impossible to be performed .",
    "however what it is suggested in the present work is the verification of higher harmonic curves of fig.[fig2 ] , of the number of pairs @xmath184versus their spectrum , when measuring the number and the momenta of the created electrons(positrons ) at angle @xmath293 .",
    "finally the range of applicability of this approximation have been investigated and the results are presented in fig.[fig5 ] . in particular working with a chosen frequency , for each q there exists a maximum value @xmath255 and thus a maximum electric field @xmath294 that can be used . as has been demonstrated by the analysis of fig.[fig5 ] in section iii there important consequences for a potential experimental verification of the suggested plots of fig.[fig2](a , b ) .",
    "consequently one can describe the following attractive experimental scenario .",
    "initially one should choose a laser energy @xmath246 capable of generating a higher harmonic @xmath269 beam .",
    "then by appropriate focusing , increase the electric field at the value @xmath295 where @xmath296 is the lowest value of the @xmath297 curve of fig.[fig5 ] , and form the standing wave as required by the theory . the number of pairs @xmath203 created at the antinodes versus their spectrum will be given by figures such as those of fig.2(a , b ) drawn for @xmath286 .",
    "then @xmath184 maximizes for pairs with energy @xmath298 where ( @xmath152 , @xmath296 ) is the lowest point of the @xmath297 curve of fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "higher harmonics thus give a wider pair spectrum and a lower @xmath294 value required , both been of great experimental advantage .    in concluding one should state that use of xfel technology ( equivalent to ultrahigh harmonics ) overcomes the difficulties of so high order of multiphoton processes present in the optical regime , while giving a wider range of electric field changes .",
    "investigations along the lines of the present article of the application of the resonant approximation using xfel are in progress .                    v.s .",
