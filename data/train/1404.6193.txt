    "measuring performance in higher education has become an important issue in oecd countries ( oecd , 2013 ; stolz et al . , 2010 ) .",
    "there is a permanent search for lodestone of academic quality and prestige , which contributes to increase the controversy that fuels the university ranking industry .",
    "most of the existing empirical works on universities evaluation look at student - level administrative data ( belloc et al .",
    ", 2012 ; belloc et al . , 2011 ; belloc et al . , 2010 ; bini et al . , 2009 ; arulampalam et al . , 2004 ; biggeri et al",
    ". , 2001 ) aiming at capturing students performance or at aggregate data aiming at comparing universities under different perspectives ( triventi and trivellato , 2009 ; rampichini et al . , 2004 ; abbott and doucouliagos , 2003 ) . while defining",
    "the output of student - level analyses is straightforward ( e.g. dropout ) , a major hurdle in evaluating higher education institutions relies on the definition of appropriate indicators able to measure the _ quality _ and the _ effectiveness _ of the university activities . nowadays a unifying proposal of university performance indexes is still more desirable since tools for information about university performance are more easily available than in the past .",
    "as far as we know there are no standard rules to compute such indexes and their properties have been widely debated over many years .",
    "although the use of descriptive and synthetic indicators is crucial to inform the non - specialist people ( see e.g. censis 2012 ) , purely descriptive approaches may fail in capturing the complex university structure .",
    "it could be stressed that two main drawbacks should be avoided : ambiguity , which occurs when the global index signals a bad situation but the sub - indexes do not , and eclipsicity , which indicates good general conditions while the sub - indexes say the contrary .",
    "thus , evaluating university performance on a single indicator may be inappropriate because it may ignore the multi - factor dimension of performance .    a multivariate analysis , which accounts for the several university aspects ( namely _ productivity _ , _ teaching _ , _ fund raising and research _ and _ internationalization _ ) , is crucial to avoid misleading results , and more complex statistical approaches can be introduced to _ measure _ university performances .",
    "interesting proposals have been introduced in a clustering framework ( ibanez et al . , 2014 ; valadkhani and ville , 2009 ) .",
    "with the aim of identifying similarities and/or differences among universities , by claiming the existence of groups with close characteristics , we aim at extending this branch of literature by jointly clustering universities and performance indicators , leading to the identification of different _ double _ partitions .",
    "a possible and straightforward approach is to separately cluster universities and indicators .",
    "nevertheless , it is widely known that this approach does not allow nor to specify an overall objective function ( thus lucking in optimality properties ) nor to take into account the dependence structure between rows and columns of the considered data matrix .",
    "following an idea that dates back to fisher ( 1969 ) and hartigan ( 1972 ) , one may find more appropriate to perform a simultaneous clustering of both units ( i.e. universities ) and variables ( i.e. indicators ) .",
    "this is generally called biclustering but also known under a broad range of different names , including double clustering , block clustering , bidimensional clustering , co - clustering , simultaneous clustering and block modeling ( for a review see e.g. van mechelen et al . , 2004 ;",
    "madeira and oliveira , 2004 ) .",
    "it is worth to note that the use of this methodology is often needed since standard cluster analysis followed by a factorial reduction ( see e.g. fraley and raftery , 2002 ) may fail in detecting relevant information in the data . in particular , in the context of university performance analysis , these standard methods may lead to a significant misinterpretation of the results since many performance patterns are common to groups of universities only under a specific set of indicators .",
    "therefore , biclustering allows to achieve the further goal of detecting groups of universities with similar behavior characterizing a specific subset of indicators .",
    "empirical analyses based on aggregate data often ignore the varied performances which occur within universities at disciplinary level , and this may bias the results .",
    "comparatively , little analysis of performance has been conducted at the disciplinary level , largely focused on compiling rankings of journals and of departments according to their productivity ( smyth and smyth , 2001 ; pomfret and wang , 2003 ; macri and sinha , 2006 ) .",
    "however , we believe that the best way to compare faculties , universities , etc . , is to focus on a particular research field and to use clustering techniques rather than straight ranking . to avoid case - mix problems",
    ", we focus only on economics faculties and collect information on several aspects of their activities in such a way to create a large set of indicators able to capture different dimensions of faculty activity .",
    "we introduce a set of 24 indicators containing information about teaching , productivity , research and internationalization indicators .",
    "such indicators are measured on 55 italian economics faculties referring to the academic years 2008 - 2009 and 2009 - 2010 . to get a picture of the overall aspects involved in the higher education system ,",
    "data are collected from different sources .",
    "mainly , we used data from the ministry of university and research ( miur ) , the national committee for the evaluation of the university system ( cnvsu ) , cineca and the lifelong learning programme .",
    "data on the erasmus project are provided by the erasmus and international relationship offices of each university . in some cases the indicators",
    "are calculated averaging over a period based on the last available academic years ( 2008 - 2009 , 2009 - 2010 ) .",
    "the main reason of this choice is making the indicators as stable ( and unbiased ) as possible over time and thus not affected by possible errors in data transmission or other occasional events .",
    "italy represents an interesting case study since its university system in last years has developed a high - level of decentralization and has reached an increased autonomy in managing and allocating resources . therefore a need of performance measurement system has been claimed both by central government and university .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follow . in section 2 ,",
    "we describe the data , introduce the indicators and provide summary ( descriptive ) statistics .",
    "the model - based biclustering used for the analysis has been proposed by martella et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and described in section 3 , along with computational details needed to obtain parameter estimates .",
    "results are discussed in section 4 , whereas section 5 provides conclusions and future development .",
    "we look at four major aspects of university performance : productivity , teaching , research and internationalization .",
    "each of these four categories will be described in depth in the following subsections      there is not a unique measure of the concept of productivity .",
    "faculties serve multiple objectives and their operation can be assessed in term of effectiveness of achieving various objectives . to measure the productivity of a faculty , defined as a ratio of output to input",
    ", we must somehow evaluate its output . in this sense , we propose the following indicators .    p1 - rate of persistence between the first and the second academic year : : :    by looking at a specific cohort , the indicator represents the number    of students enrolled in the second year , among those matriculated in    the previous academic year , over the number of students matriculated    in the previous academic year .",
    "+    the index has a higher value for the faculties with a higher    transition rate from the first to the second year of study .",
    "p2 - achieved credits : : :    credits achieved by all students during the last academic year/    ( enrolled students*60 ) . +    the quantity in the denominator represents the maximum amount of    credits achievable during an academic year .",
    "the index measures the    amount of credits actually achieved by the enrolled students over the    maximum amount of credits achievable during the considered academic    years .",
    "p3a - rate of regular students enrolled in the 3-year bachelor - level programs : : :    the index measure the portion of regular students in the 3-year    bachelor programs with respect to all the enrolled students .",
    "formally    it is defined as the number of students enrolled in a 3-year    bachelor - level programs ( or in older system programs ) for a number of    years not exceeding the official length of considered program and net    for freshman students/ total number of students enrolled in the 3-year    bachelor - level programs ( or in older system programs ) net for    freshmen , students who already have a degree and students with unknown    year of first registration . +    following the definition adopted by the miur , a regular student is a    student enrolled in the university system for a number of years not    exceeding the official length of considered program .",
    "p3.b - rate of `` regular students '' enrolled in the 2-year master - level programs : : :    students enrolled in a 2-year master - level program for a number of    years not exceeding the official length of considered program and net    for freshmen / total amount of students enrolled in the 2-year    master - level programs and net for freshmen , for students who already    have a degree and for students with unknown year of first    registration .",
    "+    the index measures the portion of `` regular students '' in the 2-year    master - level programs with respect to all the enrolled students in the    analyzed programs .",
    "p4.a  rate of `` regular graduate - students '' in the 3-year bachelor - level programs : : :    students graduated in time in a 3-year bachelor - level program ( or in    an older system program ) / total amount of students graduated in the    3-year bachelor - level programs ( or in older system programs ) net for    `` early - graduated '' students , for students who already have a degree    and for students with unknown year of first registration . +    following the definition adopted by the miur , a `` early - graduated ''    student is a student graduated before the end of the official length    of the considered program .",
    "the variable represents the portion of    students graduated in time in the 3-year bachelor - level programs .",
    "p4.b - rate of `` regular graduate - students '' in the 2-year master - level programs : : :    students graduated in time in a 2-year master - level program / total    number of students graduated the 2-year master - level programs net for    `` early - graduated '' students , for students who already have a degree    and for students with unknown year of first registration . +    the indicator represents the portion of students graduated in time in    the 2-year master - level programs .",
    "teaching is a crucial activity in the italian university system and often it is the main activity of university staff .",
    "every aspect of teaching addresses the intellectual and personal development of our students and it represents an ongoing interaction with students through course design , teaching activities , assessment and feedback .",
    "thus , measuring available _ human capital _ and resources is extremely important in order to offer an appropriate service to students .",
    "therefore , we suggest the indicators listed below , rewarding the universities with the highest values of these variables .",
    "d1 - permanent professors per credits : : :    permanent professors in the last two calendar years / total amount of    credits taught by permanent professors during their teaching    activities in the last two calendar years .",
    "+    being fixed the amount of credits , the indicator achieves a higher    value when the number of permanent professors is higher . in other    words ,",
    "the indicator rewards faculties in which the amount of credits    is provided by a higher number of permanent professors .",
    "d2 - permanent professors per enrolled student : : :    permanent professors in the last two calendar years / total number of    enrolled students in the last two academic years .",
    "d3 - seats per enrolled student in the academic year 2009 - 2010 : : :    number of total seats in the last academic year / total amount of    students enrolled in the last academic year .",
    "d4 - seats per student enrolled in the academic year 2008 - 2009 : : :    number of total seats in the academic year 2008 - 2009 / total amount of    students enrolled in the academic year 2008 - 2009 .",
    "d5 - researchers to professors ratio : : :    researchers available in the last two academic years / ordinary    professors in the last two academic years .",
    "d6 - monitored teaching activities : : :    number of monitored teaching activities / total amount of available    teaching activities      nowadays , central resources are poor and universities are looking for research funds more often than before . performing high - level research",
    "attracts funds and may contribute to the development of the structure .",
    "therefore , we select the following indicators    r1 - financed research units per professor : : :    total amount of national and local research units financed by the prin    program in the last three years/ average number of permanent    professors during the last three calendar years .",
    "r2 - average funding per research unit : : :    total amount of funding obtained by national and local research units    from the participation in the prin program / total number of financed    units .",
    "r3  submitted projects per professor : : :    total number of research units submitted for co - financing concerning    the prin program during the last three calendar years/ average number    of permanent professors during the last three calendar years .",
    "r4 - success rate in the prin program : : :    total amount of research units ( national and local ) financed by the    prin program/ total number of units submitted for co - financing .",
    "r5 - average funding for international research per professor : : :    total amount of funding from the european union and other foreign    public / private institutions and projects with high scientific    relevance financed by mae or miur in the last three calendar years /    average number of permanent professors in the last three calendar    years .",
    "r6 - financed research projects per professor : : :    total number of research units financed by the european commission in    the last three calendar years / average number of permanent professor    in the last three calendar years .",
    "r7 - average funding for firb project : : :    funding for firb project obtained during the last three calendar years    / total number of financed projects .      internationalization of education and students mobility represent top priorities to be a prestigious university .",
    "the aim is to promote cooperation between higher education institutions and contribute to the development of a pool of well - qualified , open - minded and internationally experienced young people as future professionals .",
    "we want to measure this capability by examining the following indicators .",
    "i1  outgoing student mobility : : :    number of students who completed a period of study abroad through the    erasmus project or other similar projects in the last two academic    years/ total number of enrolled students ( net of freshmen ) in the last    two academic years .",
    "i2  incoming student mobility : : :    foreign students with erasmus scholarship during the last two academic    years / total number of enrolled students in the last two academic    years .",

    "i4 - international opportunities : : :    number of funding obtained due to international cooperation activities    in the last three calendar years/ average number of permanent    professors during the last three calendar years .",
    "i5 - courses with double or joint title : : :    number of programs with double or joint title / total number of    activated programs .      our final data set consists of 55 economics faculties , over the 60 currently belonging to the italian university system .",
    "the 5 ones not included in the sample have been dropped due to the lack of information on one or more of the introduced indicators .",
    "in particular , we collected data on 48 public and 7 private institutions .",
    "summary information on all the considered indicators are provided in figure [ summary ] .",
    "most of the variables show high variability , providing evidence of heterogeneity in the sample .",
    "most of the considered units lacks in internationalization with few exceptions only , which can be considered as outliers ( in a broad sense ) .",
    "similarly , on the research field , it is possible to identify few units funded by national grants , whilst most of the considered faculties do not success in any research grant .",
    "our modelling framework is based on the biclustering approach proposed by martella et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , where the idea is to approximate the data density by a mixture of gaussian distributions with an appropriate component - specific covariance structure .",
    "more precisely , we consider a partition of indicators by imposing a binary and row stochastic matrix representing column partition , whereas the traditional mixture approach is used to defined university clustering .    formally ,",
    "let us define a @xmath0-dimensional vector , @xmath1 , representing the faculty profile for the @xmath2-th faculty over @xmath0 indicators ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "conditional on the @xmath4-th component of the mixture model ( @xmath5 ) , @xmath1 is specified as @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the @xmath0-dimensional component - specific mean vector , @xmath8 @xmath9 is a binary row stochastic matrix representing column cluster membership , i.e. @xmath10 if and only if the @xmath11-th indicator belongs to the @xmath12-th column cluster ( and 0 otherwise ) , @xmath13 s are iid @xmath14-dimensional specific - block mean latent factors assumed to be drawn from @xmath15 , and @xmath16 denotes the @xmath17 identity matrix . furthermore , @xmath18 are iid gaussian component - specific error terms with mean @xmath19 and covariance matrix @xmath20 , which are assumed to be independent of @xmath21 .",
    "accordingly , the marginal density of @xmath1 is as follows @xmath22    where @xmath23 represents the @xmath0-variate gaussian distribution with component - specific @xmath0-dimensional mean vectors @xmath7 and @xmath24 component - specific covariance matrix @xmath25 , @xmath26 are the prior probabilities of the mixture model , with @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is a shorthand notation for all non redundant model parameters .",
    "note the proposed model may assume different specifications whether the @xmath30 and @xmath31 matrices are constrained to be equal across universities clusters or not .",
    "the full range of possible constraints provides a class of 4 different models ( see table [ pgmm ] ) .",

    "performance measurement is defined as a process of quantifying the efficiency and the effectiveness of actions .",
    "it can be regarded as a first step for policy makers to ensure that university resources are properly allocated .",
    "this paper provides some insight into the development of multi - factor performance analysis by using a multivariate technique which accounts for several university features .    under this perspective , we collected data on universities activity , creating an unique dataset .",
    "we simultaneously look at four major dimensions of universities activity , namely productivity , teaching , research and internationalization , with the further goal of measuring the ( unobserved ) _ quality _ of academic features , through the definition of latent factors . a common feature in most of the frameworks about the evaluation in higher education",
    "is the draft of a final ranking among universities with the aim of identifying top - universities and comparing their performances .",
    "nevertheless , rankings may suffer from case - mix - related problems and final results may be significantly affected by the choice of the weights in averaging the indicators .    to avoid this kind of problems , we propose a biclustering - based approach with the aim of identifying homogeneous groups of universities sharing similar characteristics and attitude towards a specific set of indicators . through an empirical application on 55 italian economics faculties , we jointly group both universities and performance indicators , leading to an intuitive and easily interpretable picture of the system .",
    "it highlights not only the strengths and weaknesses of each institution , but also clearly identify differences between public and private universities through the different correlations with all the aspects of institutions activities .",
    "thus , performance measurement on effectiveness and efficiency of academic activity is not simply a ranking list of different institutions ; rather , it is a multi - dimensional framework able to capture the multi - output data structure .",
    "these results could help the policy makers to better understand _ how _ and _ where _ implement actions in order to both improve the weaknesses and strengthen the excellence .",
    "it would be of interest for further research to look at the impact of adopted policies over time .",
    "this requires the extension of the so far introduced dataset , to include a time dimension , i.e. the creation of a panel dataset . accordingly , biclustering should be extended to the analysis of three - way data , allowing to use such a powerful methodology to a wide range of real - world data .",
