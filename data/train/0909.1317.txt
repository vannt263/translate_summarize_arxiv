    "the particle content of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) of particle physics ( see e.g. @xcite ) provides a stable weakly interacting massive particle which is , in principle , a viable particle dark matter candidate : the lightest neutralino .",
    "if the latter is the lightest @xmath0-parity odd particle , its thermal relic abundance can be close to the inferred density of dark matter on cosmological scales @xcite , whose ratio to the universal critical density is estimated to be @xmath1 @xcite , with @xmath2 the present day hubble expansion rate normalized in units of 100 km per sec per mpc .",
    "several studies have pointed out that the thermal relic abundance of neutralinos in mssm models where they are the lightest supersymmetric particles actually ranges over several orders of magnitude , simple estimates of their relic abundance being therefore only a generic order - of - magnitude estimate ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , if the lightest neutralino has unsuppressed couplings to gauge bosons , and is heavy enough for annihilation to massive weak interaction gauge bosons to be kinematically open , it rapidly annihilates into @xmath3 and/or @xmath4 final states , and its relic density @xmath5 is _ below _ the dark matter density , at least for neutralinos lighter than about a tev .",
    "if the lightest neutralino has suppressed couplings to gauge bosons , as is the case for bino - like or singlino - like neutralinos , or if neutralinos are very heavy , the neutralino relic density is instead typically much larger than the universal dark matter density .",
    "mssm models with under - abundant neutralino relic density are phenomenologically perfectly viable : the lightest neutralino can very well not be the only contributor ( or it can be a sub - dominant contributor ) to the universal dark matter , in a standard cosmological setup . while modified cosmological setups can be concocted to enhance the thermal relic abundance of neutralinos in those cases ( for instance in the presence of non - thermal production @xcite , or of a faster expansion rate at the epoch of the lightest neutralino freeze - out @xcite ) , mssm models with _ over - abundant",
    "_ relic neutralinos are , in principle , ruled out .",
    "a caveat to this conclusion is the possibility of an episode of entropy injection occurring at temperatures below the decoupling of neutralinos from the universe s thermal bath ( entropy injection before freeze - out would not change today s relic abundance of neutralinos )",
    ".    ref .",
    "@xcite gives a thorough discussion of such a class of scenarios for the specific case of an additional scalar field that drives both the entropy dilution and possibly the non - thermal production of neutralinos , as well as a modified cosmological expansion rate if the energy density associated to the scalar field dominates the universal energy budget .",
    "specific examples of setups that can produce a dilution in the relic abundance of neutralinos ( or , for that matter , of any other thermal relics decoupled from the thermal bath before entropy injection ) include for example models with moduli @xcite or q - ball decays @xcite , and scenarios with low - temperature or even weak - scale inflation @xcite . while a phase transition that plausibly occurred _",
    "after _ the neutralino freeze - out is the qcd phase transition , lattice simulations @xcite clearly indicate that the transition is not strongly first - order ( see e.g. the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the present study",
    ", we consider a specific instance of a possible source of dilution for the thermal relic abundance of relic neutralinos from the early universe , namely the electro - weak phase transition ( ewpt ) . in the minimal formulation of the standard model higgs sector ,",
    "the ewpt is very weakly first - order , or entirely absent , as found e.g. in the non - perturbative analysis of ref .",
    "however , a strongly first - order phase transition can occur within the mssm , or even in very simple extensions of the scalar sector of the standard model ( for instance via the inclusion of additional singlet scalars @xcite ) .",
    "other possibilities include for instance models with multiple hidden sector scalars coupled only to the higgs sector ( which thus acts as a `` portal '' to the hidden sector , as envisioned in ref .",
    "this possibility , which includes scenarios with tree - level conformal invariance where the higgs mass is generated via dimensional transmutation , has been discussed and studied in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "a strongly first - order phase transition needs to actually be posited in the context of scenarios where the baryon asymmetry is produced at the ewpt , to prevent the `` washout '' of the generated baryon number density by sphaleron processes ( for a pedagogical introduction to the framework of electro - weak baryogenesis see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ; classic studies on mssm baryogenesis include @xcite and @xcite ; recent discussions of the phenomenology of electro - weak baryogenesis in the mssm are given in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this case , the order parameter can be considered to be the ratio of the su(2 ) higgs background field @xmath6 to the critical temperature for the phase transition , @xmath7 , and a strongly first - order phase transition corresponds to @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the entropy injection produced in any first - order phase transition can play a relevant role in the thermal history of species that froze out prior to the phase transition , since their relic density will be diluted away by an amount dependent upon the relative entropy injected to the entropy in the species in thermal equilibrium .",
    "interestingly , the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) might potentially inform us on both the details of the scalar electro - weak sector and of the ewpt in particular ( including possible non - minimal extensions of the scalar sector @xcite ) , as well as on the mass of a putative dark matter particle . in some cases , data from the lhc",
    "might even enable us to infer , via the knowledge of particle masses and couplings , the thermal relic abundance of a stable neutralino that might be the main dark matter constituent ( explicit examples with realistic assumptions on the lhc performance are given in ref .",
    "a mismatch between the observed cold dark matter abundance and the inferred relic abundance of candidate particles discovered with colliders can have very profound consequences . if the resulting inferred thermal abundance were _ larger _ than the cold dark matter density , then the answer to the ensuing conundrum might lie in the ewpt and in the higgs sector , and thus again in physics that can , and will , be tested with the lhc .",

    "we are concerned here with determining the dilution of a relic species that decoupled ( or `` froze - out '' ) from the thermal bath in the early universe by entropy injected during a first - order phase transition occurring after the species freeze - out .",
    "the basic thermodynamics of the dilution , which we describe in the present section , is fully general , and does not depend upon the specifics of the model for the phase transition .",
    "let @xmath9 be the finite temperature effective potential of the early universe , where @xmath10 is the order parameter of the phase transition , for instance the vacuum expectation value of the neutral component of the higgs field .",
    "we assume that , for the temperatures under consideration here , there are at most two minima of the potential . at very high temperatures ,",
    "the potential only has one minimum , at @xmath11 .",
    "as the temperature drops , a second minimum develops with a corresponding effective potential value larger than that at @xmath11 . the value of the potential at the second minimum relative to the first decreases with decreasing temperature so that at @xmath12 the second minimum is the absolute minimum and there is spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "we define a `` critical temperature '' as the temperature @xmath13 when the two minima are degenerate . at some temperature @xmath14 ,",
    "the system transitions from @xmath11 to the new minimum : the tunneling probability from the @xmath15 minimum to the true vacuum is of order unity .    first , let us assume that the transition temperature @xmath16 is very close to the critical temperature @xmath7 so that supercooling is negligible . here , we follow the discussion of mgevand and snchez @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath17 be the entropy density of the high - temperature phase , and let @xmath18 be the entropy density of the low - temperature phase .",
    "we may then write the total entropy density as @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the volumetric fraction of the system in the low temperature phase .",
    "since the minima are degenerate at @xmath7 , the system is in equilibrium and the total entropy is conserved .",
    "the entropy density then scales as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the scale factor of the universe at the beginning of the phase transition .",

    "realistically , the system would not be in exact equilibrium  friction and collisions in the walls of bubbles of true vacuum would release entropy , slightly increasing the dilution @xcite .",
    "this can be quantitatively captured by assessing the variation of the dilution factor with a variation to the temperature at which the phase transition occurs , this variation being driven by the mentioned effects ( bubble collisions , friction in the bubble walls etc . ) .",

    "the entropy , however , does .",
    "if a large enough amount of reheating occurs , the universe will reach a phase coexistence stage at @xmath33 .",

    "most of these are too small to grow  the pressure difference @xmath39 between the true and false vacuum is not large enough to overcome the surface tension of their walls , so they collapse .",
    "only large bubbles can grow .",

    "the phase transition begins once the probability to nucleate a supercritical bubble in one hubble volume is of order 1 .",

    "in this section we calculate the degree of relic density dilution needed in mssm models as a function of the temperature at which neutralinos freeze out . this will allow us to immediately determine whether a given mssm model can or can not be salvaged by a strongly first - order electro - weak phase transition , the requirement being that the critical temperature of the phase transition be smaller than the freeze - out temperature , and the dilution factor be large enough to bring the neutralino relic density at or below the level of the inferred average dark matter density in the universe .",
    "we work in the context of the @xmath0-parity , flavor and cp - conserving mssm , we enforce that the lightest supersymmetric particle be the lightest neutralino , and parameterize the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters that enter the relevant particle spectrum for the calculation of the neutralino relic abundance with their values at the electro - weak scale ( we thus do not assume any grand unified structure for the soft supersymmetry - breaking terms ) .",
    "we do not assume any relationship between the gaugino soft supersymmetry breaking masses , nor about their relative signs , but we assume a common mass scale for all sfermions .",

    "we then calculate the thermal relic abundance of the lightest neutralinos , in the context of a standard cosmological setup , with the darksusy package @xcite .",
    "the two parameters we are interested in for the present study are the thermal neutralino relic abundance , and the temperature at which the neutralino freezes out : a phase transition occurring at temperatures larger than the freeze - out temperature would not affect the relic abundance of neutralinos , since the latter would be in thermal equilibrium after the phase transition and its number density would re - equilibrate to the other thermal species .",
    "we define the freeze - out temperature according to the prescription of ref .",

    "notice that the pair annihilation of bino - like neutralinos proceeds through a variety of channels , including squark and higgs exchanges , which dramatically depend on the details of the spectrum of the relevant particles .",
    "this induces a wide scatter in the relic abundance versus mass ( or freeze - out temperature ) of bino - like models , as evident in fig .",

    "we additionally add massless bosons ( i.e. , @xmath140 ) with @xmath141 degrees of freedom , which approximates the number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the standard model .",
    "that is , we have a variable number of degrees of freedom for massive particles , but keep the number of massless particles constant .",
    "the latter just adds the @xmath10-independent term @xmath142 to the free energy of eq .",

    "( [ eq : t * ] ) .",
    "note that the addition of massless particles does not change the phase transition temperature or dynamics .",
    "it does , however , add entropy to both the high and low - temperature phases , which decreases the overall dilution factor via eq .",

    "the black lines correspond to models without any fermion contribution and variable yukawa couplings .",
    "the models in the highest of these lines have the maximal couplings for which the point at @xmath11 , @xmath144 is a maximum , while the lower lines have 0.9 , 0.8 , and 0.7 times the maximum couplings .",
    "the dotted red and dashed green lines correspond to models with equal fermion and boson contributions .",

    "for boson - fermion models with reasonably large yukawa couplings and many degrees of freedom , one can achieve dilution factors on the order of 100 .",
    "purely bosonic models , on the other hand , can only reach dilution factors on the order of 10 .",
    "the largest aspect contributing to this discrepancy is the range of yukawa couplings available to the different cases . at @xmath145 10,000 ,",
    "the maximum coupling for bosons is only @xmath146 , while the highest plotted dilution factor for a boson - fermion model has @xmath147 . when purely bosonic and boson - fermion models have identical couplings , the bosonic models tend to have slightly higher dilution factors .",
    "one can easily explain two of the important qualitative features of figs .",
    "[ fig : dilution ] and  [ fig : trvsg ] by examining the free energy of eq .",
    "( [ eq : f ] ) .",
    "first , the temperature of the phase transition tends to decrease with increasing degrees of freedom .",
    "the temperature - dependent term in the free energy has a coefficient of @xmath148 .",
    "when this term is large , the second minimum of the potential disappears and the origin becomes the true vacuum .",
    "thus , we expect the temperature of the transition to scale as @xmath149 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : trvsg ] .",
    "second , the dilution factor tends to increase with increasing yukawa couplings and decreasing temperature scales .",
    "if either @xmath2 is large or @xmath150 is small , then the temperature - dependent term is nearly zero except for small @xmath10 , excluding resummed daisy terms ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : i+- ] for the behavior of @xmath151 ) .",
    "therefore , the entropy @xmath137 is much smaller in the true vacuum than it is at the origin . including the daisy terms",
    ", the negative slope of @xmath152 tends to decrease the entropy at high @xmath10 .",
    "if the transition reaches a phase coexistence stage , then the small entropy leads directly to a high dilution factor via eq .",
    "( [ eq : dilution1 ] ) .",
    "this effect dominates when @xmath153 , which is the case for the boson - fermion models in fig .",

    "red , green and blue points correspond to bino , higgsino , and wino - like models , while the solid black , dotted red , and dashed green lines correspond to phase transition models with only bosons at their maximal yukawa couplings , bosons and fermions at the same yukawa couplings , and bosons and fermions with fixed yukawa couplings of @xmath162 .",

    "the freeze - out temperature of the dark matter must be larger than the final reheating temperature of the phase transition if the transition is to have an effect upon dark matter abundance .",

    "a strongly first - order electro - weak phase transition , warranted in the context of scenarios for the production of the observed baryon asymmetry at the electro - weak scale , can lead to a significant dilution of the thermal relic abundance of the lightest supersymmetric particle , if the latter is stable . in this paper",
    "we studied the impact of toy models for the electro - weak sector on the relic abundance of mssm neutralinos .",
    "specifically , we considered the effect on the electro - weak sector of adding a large number of bosonic or bosonic - plus - fermionic degrees of freedom , which affects both the one - loop temperature - independent and the temperature - dependent contribution to the effective potential of the higgs field .",
    "we noted that for neutralino freeze - out temperatures between 20 - 40 gev , corresponding to neutralino masses at or above 400 gev , the dilution due to the entropy injected in the first - order electro - weak phase transition can be as large as 10100 if we postulate a large number of extra degrees of freedom ( @xmath167 ) .",
    "numerous mssm models exist that could be viable if such a dilution effect is in fact operative . for models with a more modest number of additional d.o.f .",
    "( say , of the same order of the standard model d.o.f . ) , the dilution can still be on the order of 2 .",
    "we find that a cubic term in the effective potential has a comparatively small effect upon the relic abundance of species .",
    "also , we showed that the dilution expected in the context of the mssm without additional degrees of freedom coupled to the higgs sector is a very small effect , at most at the few - percent level .",
    "should future data from the lhc point towards a neutralino relic abundance larger than the cosmological dark matter density , the origin of the mis - match might lie in the same electro - weak scale physics that the lhc itself will concurrently explore .",
    "interestingly , this can be profoundly intertwined with the question of the origin of the matter - antimatter asymmetry in the early universe , opening up the possibility that electro - weak physics lie at the core of both dark and visible matter , and that the lhc will soon shed light and perhaps unveil this scenario .",
