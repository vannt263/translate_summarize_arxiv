    "measurement of gravitational waves from inspiraling compact binaries ( composed of neutron stars and/or black holes ) by forthcoming laser interferometric detectors ( such as ligo @xcite and virgo @xcite ) will rely heavily on theoretical templates obtained from approximations to the exact laws of general relativity @xcite .",
    "one possible method to calculate these templates , which has been pushed to a high degree of accuracy @xcite , is the post - newtonian approximation , which is based upon the assumption that the orbital motion is slow .",
    "another approach is black - hole perturbation theory @xcite , which is accurate only in the unrealistic situation of systems with small mass ratios .",
    "currently , the post - newtonian approach appears to be the most promising for generating the templates .",
    "unfortunately , however , there is considerable evidence that the post - newtonian approximation has poor convergence @xcite , if it converges at all .",
    "it is important to understand the reasons for the poor convergence .",
    "although this issue is still an open one , some preliminary steps were taken in this direction in a previous paper @xcite .",
    "the amount of energy radiated per unit time ( denoted @xmath6 ) by a binary system in circular orbit can be expressed as an infinite sum over the multipole moments of the gravitational - wave field , which are related to the behaviour of the source . in a slow - motion approximation , each multipole moment is then expressed as a post - newtonian expansion in powers of @xmath0 , the ratio of the orbital velocity to the speed of light . since higher - order moments come with a higher power of the orbital velocity ,",
    "the post - newtonian approximation to @xmath6 consists of truncating the multipole sum at a given multipole order , and in calculating the contributing moments to the appropriate post - newtonian order .",
    "we will refer to this expansion of @xmath6 in powers of @xmath0 as the `` true post - newtonian series '' . at present , only a few terms of this post - newtonian series have been calculated @xcite , and the issue of its converge is not at all clear . however , since post - newtonian corrections can be computed for _ all _ the multipole moments , the simpler issue of the convergence of the _ multipole _ sum can be addressed .    in reference",
    "@xcite , the convergence of the multipole series was studied in the restricted context of a `` bare multipole truncation '' , in which the multipole moments were calculated only to leading - order in a post - newtonian expansion .",
    "we refer to these bare moments as `` newtonian '' , and the bare multipole truncation therefore consists of discarding all post - newtonian corrections to each of the multipole moments . when an approximation to @xmath6 is constructed by summing over all these bare moments , it is found that the series converges for all orbital velocities less than a critical value .",
    "this value depends on the mass ratio of the system ; in the case of very small mass ratios , to which we specialize in this paper , the condition for convergence is @xmath7 , where @xmath2 is the base of natural logarithms .",
    "the convergent interval includes all physically relevant values for the orbital velocity , which must be smaller than its value at the innermost stable circular orbit , @xmath8 .",
    "although the bare multipole truncation is an unphysical approximation which compares poorly with the numerically `` exact '' results @xcite , this analysis reveals that an eventual failure of the true post - newtonian series to converge can not originate from summing over the newtonian part of all the multipole moments .    in this paper",
    ", we extend the results of reference @xcite to a `` dressed multipole truncation '' , in which the leading - order moments are corrected with terms of relative order @xmath3 ( first post - newtonian , or 1pn , terms ) and @xmath4 ( 1.5pn terms ) .",
    "this improved analysis relies on a previous paper of ours @xcite , in which the equations of black - hole perturbation theory are integrated for an arbitrary perturbing stress - energy tensor @xmath9 ( the unperturbed spacetime is assumed to be schwarzschild ) . applying the results of this paper to the particular case of a particle moving on a circular orbit returns the desired post - newtonian corrections to the bare multipole moments derived in reference @xcite .",
    "the dressed multipole truncation gives three separate series for @xmath6 .",
    "the first is the bare multipole series , in which we sum over the newtonian part of all the multipole moments .",
    "the second and third series incorporate the 1pn and 1.5pn corrections to the bare moments , respectively .",
    "we find that each of the series converges for @xmath1 , and we conclude that inclusion of these post - newtonian corrections does not affect the convergence of the multipole sum .",
    "this shows that an eventual failure of the true post - newtonian series to converge can not originate from summing over the newtonian , 1pn , and 1.5pn part of all the multipole moments .",
    "the following sections of the paper provide the details of the calculation .",
    "the dressed multipole truncation is introduced in sec .  [ 2 ] , and the convergence of the resulting series is established in sec .",
    "[ 3 ] . finally , concluding remarks are provided in sec .",
    "in this section , we extend the bare multipole calculation of reference @xcite by calculating the 1pn and 1.5pn corrections to the multipole moments of the gravitational - wave field .",
    "such corrections have been calculated for general sources , first by blanchet @xcite using post - newtonian theory , and then by us @xcite using black - hole perturbation theory . to carry out this calculation",
    ", we apply the results of reference @xcite ( hereafter referred to as lp ) to the specific case of a point particle moving on a circular orbit around a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "we denote by @xmath10 the mass of the particle , and by @xmath11 the mass of the black hole .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath12 .",
    "we also denote the orbital radius by @xmath13 , and the angular velocity is @xmath14 .",
    "finally , we define the orbital velocity by @xmath15 . throughout",
    "we use units such that @xmath16 .",
    "the gravitational - wave luminosity is given by @xcite @xmath17 ,      \\label{power}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the mass and current multipole moments , respectively , while @xmath20 denotes retarded time .",
    "( because the orbit is fixed , @xmath6 does not actually vary with @xmath20 . ) to evaluate @xmath6 , we shall use equations ( 5.37)(5.39 ) of lp , which give the fourier transform of the moments , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "these equations incorporate post - newtonian corrections of up to order @xmath23 , relative to the leading - order , newtonian expressions .    to evaluate the multipole moments",
    ", we must first compute the source terms , which are constructed from the stress - energy tensor of the orbiting particle @xcite . using equations ( 5.24)(5.27 ) of lp",
    ", we find that the only nonzero source terms are @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 ,   \\qquad \\nonumber \\\\ & &   \\label{source } \\\\ _ 0 t & = & \\frac{v^2}{2 } \\left [ 1 + \\frac { 3v^2}{2 } + o(v^4 ) \\right ] , \\qquad \\delta = \\frac { \\mu}{r_0 ^ 2}\\ , \\delta ( r - r_0 ) \\delta ( \\cos \\theta ) \\delta ( \\phi - \\omega t ) , \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath29 .",
    "the second step is to substitute these results into equations ( 5.37)(5.39 ) of lp .",
    "after a few steps of algebra , the mass and current multipole moments become @xmath30^{1/2 }   { \\mathcal{t}}_l ( \\omega)\\ , ( - i \\omega r_0)^l\\ , a_l ( \\omega )    \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\mbox { } \\times ( r+ 2_0t)\\ , y_{lm}({\\textstyle \\frac{\\pi}{2}},0)\\ ,   \\delta(\\omega - m \\omega ) , \\label{mass_1 } \\\\ \\tilde{\\cal s}_{lm } ( \\omega ) & = &   \\frac { - 16 \\pi i \\mu}{(2l+1 ) ! ! } \\left ( \\frac{l+2}{l-1 } \\right ) ^{1/2 } { \\mathcal{t}}_l^{\\ # } ( \\omega)\\ , ( - i \\omega r_0)^l\\ , b_l ( \\omega )    \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\mbox { } \\times \\left [ { _ { -1}j } { _ { -1 } y_{lm}}({\\textstyle \\frac{\\pi}{2}},0 )   + { _ 1j } { _ 1 y_{lm } } ( { \\textstyle",

    "\\label{s_3 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the dressed multipole truncation therefore splits @xmath6 into three separate series : @xmath55 , the bare multipole series , @xmath56 , the 1pn correction , and @xmath57 , the 1.5pn correction .",
    "it is important to point out that in equations ( [ s_1])([s_3 ] ) , the sums over @xmath58 are restricted to values such that @xmath36 is _",
    "even_.    the convergence of the dressed multipole series may be established by analyzing the convergence of each of the partial series .",
    "we begin with @xmath55 , the bare multipole series of reference @xcite .",
    "its convergence is established in the following manner .",
    "first , it is shown ( numerically ) that the terms in the square brackets of equation ( [ s_1 ] ) approach the approximate value 1.01 as @xmath59 .",
    "this implies that the behaviour of the series for large @xmath60 is dominated by the factor in front of the square brackets .",
    "the series may therefore be approximated by @xmath61 , which is shown ( using the cauchy ratio test ) to converge for @xmath62 the convergence of @xmath63 is established in the same manner .",
    "first , one shows numerically that the terms in the square brackets of equation ( [ s_2 ] ) also approach 1.01 as @xmath59 .",
    "the series is then approximated by @xmath64 , and the convergence of this series is again analyzed via the cauchy ratio test . using equation ( [ blm ] ) , we find that @xmath65 is equal to @xmath66 multiplied by a ratio of terms quadratic in @xmath60 . in the limit @xmath59 , @xmath67 and we immediately conclude that the convergence of @xmath63 is also determined by equation ( [ v_range ] ) .",
    "the same is true also for @xmath68 .",
    "again , it can be shown that the terms in the square brackets of equation ( [ s_3 ] ) approach 1.01 as @xmath59 .",
    "the series is then approximated by @xmath69 . from equation ( [ clm ] ) we see that in the limit @xmath59 , the ratio of successive coefficients is equal to @xmath66 .",
    "this allows us to conclude that the convergence of @xmath68 is also determined by equation ( [ v_range ] ) .    in summary ,",
    "when 1pn and 1.5pn corrections are added to the bare multipole series , @xmath6 splits naturally into three separate series , which all converge for @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , the dressed multipole truncation of @xmath6 must also converge in this interval .",
    "we note that this convergence test ignores the fact that the combined series @xmath71 is alternating at large @xmath60 .",
    "however , establishing the convergence of the alternating series using the leibnitz criterion does not result in an improvement on equation ( [ v_range ] ) .",
    "furthermore , a numerical analysis of the convergence of @xmath72 confirms equation ( [ v_range ] ) .",
    "we have shown that for circular binaries with small mass ratios , the dressed multipole truncation leads to a convergent series for the gravitational - wave luminosity , for all physically relevant values of the orbital velocity .",
    "it appears likely that this conclusion will remain valid for binaries of comparable masses , but a separate calculation is required to confirm this .",
    "our results imply that the poor convergence of the true post - newtonian series does not originate from summing over the newtonian , 1pn , and 1.5pn part of all the multipole moments .",
    "we see in figure 1 that the dressed - multipole series leads to a significant improvement in accuracy , compared with the bare - multipole series . by including the negative 1pn corrections and the ( smaller ) positive 1.5pn corrections ,",
    "our approximation to the luminosity coincides ( within 1 % ) with the numerically `` exact '' results @xcite over the interval @xmath73 .",
    "one would therefore expect that the incorporation of further corrections would lead to a series that converges everywhere in the region of physical interest , and stays accurate over a larger interval .",
    "meanwhile , the issue of the convergence of the true post - newtonian series remains an open one .",
