    "dynamical decoupling ( dd ) pulse sequences have had a long history beginning with the hahn spin echo @xcite and the carr - purcell - meiboom - gill sequences @xcite and continuing to the present . recently , uhrig has developed a dd sequence that , by varying the time intervals between pulses , is able to decouple transverse dephasing to order @xmath0 in the system - bath coupling strength with @xmath1 pulse intervals @xcite .",
    "the uhrig decoupling sequence is in fact universal , decoupling both classical and quantum baths that cause either transverse dephasing or longitudinal relaxation @xcite .",
    "several generalizations of the uhrig sequence , and its use of non - uniform pulse intervals , have now been made .",
    "these generalizations allow high - order decoupling of a single qubit from dephasing noise baths with different noise power spectra @xcite , decoupling of a single qubit from baths causing simultaneous dephasing and relaxation @xcite , and decoupling of multi - qubit systems from general baths @xcite .",
    "the uhrig decoupling scheme and its generalizations all require single qubit pauli pulses for implementation .    in semiconductor quantum dot systems ,",
    "however , single qubit operations are not easily implemented , in contrast with the two qubit exchange interaction .",
    "while the exchange interaction can be performed in sub - nanosecond time scales @xcite , single qubit rotations may be two orders of magnitude slower or more @xcite , and can be technically more demanding .",
    "the difference in requirements between single and two qubit gates has led to the development of encodings that use the exchange interaction alone @xcite .",
    "the smallest such encoding is the 3-qubit decoherence free subsystem ( dfs ) , for which explicit exchange gate sequences for encoded universal computation are given in @xcite .",
    "creation of a dfs itself may also be performed using exchange pulses alone @xcite . while encoded computation can be performed with exchange gates alone",
    ", the use of the dd pulse sequences described above would require single qubit pauli operations .",
    "here we demonstrate that exchange gates alone suffice for high - order decoupling of the dfs - encoded information from general baths .",
    "our new exchange - only dd sequences explicitly take advantage of the decoherence free properties of dfs encodings .",
    "because the 3-qubit dfs is decoherence free with respect to any global interaction , decoupling from a decohering bath can be achieved by globalizing any local interactions to high order .",
    "in contrast to standard pauli - based decoupling schemes , our aim is not to cancel system - bath coupling terms , but to globalize them , so that the effective hamiltonian created by the dd scheme causes only the gauge qubit and bath to evolve .",
    "this idea applies to any subsystem encoding : decoupling need only preserve the subsystem of interest while gauge subsystems can evolve arbitrarily .",
    "an alternative method for low - order leakage elimination using the simultaneous operation of multiple exchange gates has been given in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : background ]",
    "we briefly review aspects of the uhrig dynamical decoupling sequence and the 3-qubit decoherence free subsystem .",
    "section [ sec : classical_dd ] describes how exchange - only decoupling is achieved for a 3-qubit dfs subject to dephasing from a classical noise bath .",
    "section [ sec : quantum_dd ] gives the analogous exposition for decoupling from a quantum bath .",
    "simulations of the decoupling sequences for a dfs qubit coupled to classical and quantum baths are presented in section [ sec : simulations ] .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] . in the following we use the acronym dfs to refer to decoherence free subsystem ( rather than subspace ) .",
    "we assume `` bang - bang '' exchange pulses perform the decoupling , i.e. , the pulses perform a perfect finite operation using infinite power in infinitesimal time .",
    "the uhrig dynamical decoupling ( udd ) sequence decouples a single qubit from a classical dephasing bath @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian for such a system is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the pauli @xmath3 operator and @xmath4 is a time - dependent real - valued function .",
    "subjected to a sequence of @xmath5 pulses about the @xmath6-axis , the hamiltonian in the toggling frame becomes @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the udd `` switching function '' and takes values of @xmath9 .",
    "the switching times , when @xmath10 switches between 1 and -1 ( or vice versa ) , give the instances when @xmath5 pulses are applied .",
    "the propagator corresponding to free evolution interspersed with @xmath5 pulses is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the total time of the dd sequence , and the accumulated phase @xmath13 from the classical noise bath over time @xmath12 is @xmath14 for order @xmath0 decoupling , we require that @xmath15 for all @xmath16 , which leaves only terms of order @xmath17 and higher in the accumulated phase . in other words , the dd sequence has resulted in an effective hamiltonian with system - bath coupling only at order @xmath17 and higher .",
    "uhrig showed that the switching times for order @xmath0 decoupling are given by the simple formula @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "it was subsequently shown that the udd sequence is in fact universal @xcite , i.e. , udd decouples dephasing due to both classical and quantum baths .",
    "the propagator ( [ eq : ut ] ) evolves an initial state @xmath20 to the final state @xmath21 .",
    "the fidelity of memory preservation due to the decoupled evolution is then @xmath22 for an initial state on the @xmath23-axis of the bloch sphere @xmath24 , and the performance of the dd sequence can be described in terms of the decoherence function @xmath25 @xcite , which is the expectation value of the pauli @xmath26 operator .",
    "when @xmath24 , the fidelity and the decoherence function are related through @xmath27 . for a noise bath with gaussian statistics , the ensemble averaged decoherence function is @xmath28 here @xmath29 is the bath s noise spectral density and @xmath30 is the fourier transform of the udd switching function @xmath31 of order @xmath0 : @xmath32 since @xmath33 are the udd switching times , @xmath34 is the midpoint of the @xmath35 interval , where @xmath36 is @xmath37 .",
    "the expression in ( [ eq : filter_function ] ) is the `` filter function '' ; together with ( [ eq : coherence ] ) and ( [ eq : chi ] ) the filter function gives an interpretation of the udd sequence as a solution to a filter design problem @xcite .",
    "for the udd sequence , the filter function gives a high - pass filter , suitable for decoupling noise spectra with a sharp high - frequency cutoff .",
    "the switching times can be adjusted to decouple noise spectra with other frequency characteristics @xcite .",
    "the general theory of decoherence free subspaces and subsystems and encoded universality is given in @xcite .",
    "initialization , measurement , and universal computation in the 3-qubit dfs are described in @xcite . in this subsection",
    "we give a brief summary of the 3-qubit dfs to fix notation and to provide the physical motivation behind the pulse sequence designs in the following sections .",
    "the states of three spin-@xmath38 qubits can be described by the quantum numbers of three commuting operators @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath39 is the total spin of all three qubits and distinguishes valid and leaked states in the dfs encoding .",
    "@xmath40 is the total spin of the first two of the three qubits and determines the encoded qubit state .",
    "@xmath41 is the total @xmath42-axis spin of the three qubits and gives the gauge state .",
    "explicit definitions of these operators are given in @xcite .",
    "the states of the eight dimensional hilbert space of the three qubits are explicitly : @xmath43 where states on the left in ( [ eq : ket1])([eq : ket8 ] ) are assigned labels 18 , states in the middle are described in the angular momentum basis @xmath44 , and states on the right are written in terms of the standard computational basis .",
    "states @xmath45@xmath46 in ( [ eq : ket1])([eq : ket4 ] ) span the valid subspace of the 3-qubit dfs .",
    "states @xmath45 and @xmath47 are encoded 0 states , with gauge states @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively ; states @xmath50 and @xmath46 are encoded 1 states , with gauge states @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively . in the valid subspace ,",
    "the encoded quantum number @xmath40 and the gauge quantum number @xmath41 may be considered as the computational basis states of two two - state subsystems  two effective qubits .",
    "the states have been ordered so that the first subsystem effective qubit gives the encoded state in the dfs and the second subsystem effective qubit gives the gauge state .",
    "valid dfs states must not only be in the valid subspace , but additionally be factorizable between the encoded and gauge quantum numbers .",
    "we also define a projector onto the valid subspace @xmath51 for use in section [ sec : classical_dd ] .",
    "encoded operations are performed with exchange gates between pairs of constituent physical qubits . because exchange commutes with the total angular momentum operators @xmath39 and @xmath41 , exchange can only change the encoded dfs quantum number while leaving the gauge and leaked quantum numbers unaffected .",
    "similarly , any interaction comprised of total spin component operators can only change the gauge quantum number @xmath41 and leaves the encoded @xmath40 and leaked @xmath39 quantum numbers unchanged .",
    "the encoded qubit is thus decoherence free with respect to any global interaction . for a given system - bath coupling of the dfs constituent physical qubits ,",
    "our goal is to design a pulse sequence resulting in an effective hamiltonian whose system - bath interactions to order @xmath0 contain only total spin component @xmath52 , @xmath53 , or @xmath41 operators .",
    "consider the following hamiltonian coupling a 3-qubit dfs to a classical constant dephasing noise bath : @xmath54 where @xmath55 gives the pauli @xmath3 operator for physical qubit @xmath56 , and @xmath57 is a constant ( in time ) real number giving the bath strength at qubit @xmath56 .",
    "free evolution corresponding to ( [ eq : h_1 ] ) is @xmath58 .",
    "we define the pulse @xmath59 as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a full swap operation between qubits @xmath62 and @xmath56 .",
    "the hamiltonian in ( [ eq : h_1 ] ) conjugated singly and doubly by the pulse @xmath59 gives the permuted hamiltonians @xmath63 conjugation by @xmath59 causes the physical qubits to dephase under the influence of the different local noise baths . by spending equal time in each of the three permutations in ( [ eq : h_1 ] ) , ( [ eq : h_2 ] ) , and ( [ eq : h_3])the even permutations ( alternating group @xmath64 ) of the symmetric group @xmath65 on three elements  we generate an effective global system - bath interaction .",
    "the propagator corresponding to equal time evolution in each permutation is given by @xmath66 the effective hamiltonian in ( [ eq : first_order_effective_hamiltonian ] ) consists of the total spin-@xmath42 operator alone and evolves only the gauge qubit .",
    "we have thus decoupled the encoded subsystem state from the dephasing bath to first order .",
    "the pulse sequence for this first order exchange - only scheme is shown explicitly in ( [ eq : first_order_pulsing ] ) and involves free evolution and full swap ( exchange ) operations alone .",
    "of course the bath functions are not generally constant , and in the following we describe how this `` globalization '' of the hamiltonian can be accomplished to high order for general time - varying bath functions .",
    "we will see that free evolution for non - uniform time intervals , interspersed with full swap operations , is sufficient for high order decoupling .    for local classical dephasing baths with arbitrary time dependence",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath67 since the effect of conjugation by @xmath59 or @xmath68 is to permute the local bath seen by the constituent qubits , the hamiltonian in the toggling frame ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : hamt ] ) ) is @xmath69 where @xmath70 and identifies which local bath constituent qubit @xmath56 is experiencing .",
    "restriction to @xmath64 permutations completely specifies @xmath71 and @xmath72 in terms of @xmath73 : @xmath74 and @xmath75 , where the modulus is taken with offset 1 . for notational convenience",
    "we use all three @xmath76 s in the following .",
    "the three types of hamiltonians @xmath77 ( [ eq : h_1 ] ) , @xmath78 ( [ eq : h_2 ] ) , and @xmath79 ( [ eq : h_3 ] ) ( generalized to time - dependent local baths ) have @xmath80 values of 1 , 3 , and 2 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath76 s change values when @xmath59 or @xmath68 pulses are applied . between pulses",
    "the @xmath76 values are constant .",
    "the instances at which the pulses are applied are the switching times for exchange - only decoupling .",
    "unlike the udd situation , both the switching times _ and _ the hamiltonian sequence ( or @xmath73 ) must be determined .",
    "the udd case involves only two hamiltonian types and one pulse type : the pauli @xmath81 pulse toggles the evolution back and forth between the two hamiltonian types . in the dfs case , we may choose to apply either a @xmath59 or @xmath68 pulse , i.e. , after evolution under one of the hamiltonians ( [ eq : h_1 ] ) , ( [ eq : h_2 ] ) , or ( [ eq : h_3 ] ) , the next evolution interval can be chosen from either of the remaining two hamiltonians .",
    "the propagator associated with the modulated hamiltonian ( [ eq : ht ] ) is @xmath82 where @xmath83 gives the phase accumulated by constituent qubit @xmath56 in time @xmath12 , @xmath84 if all the @xmath83 values are equal , the propagator will contain only a global interaction term generated by the total spin @xmath41 , which drives gauge evolution only .",
    "computing the fidelity of memory preservation shows explicitly that setting all the @xmath83 equal leaves the encoded subsystem unchanged .",
    "given an initial dfs state @xmath85 , where @xmath86 gives the encoded subsystem state and @xmath87 gives the gauge subsystem state , the fidelity of memory preservation under the evolution in ( [ eq : u ] ) is @xmath88 the sum over @xmath89 is a partial trace over the gauge subsystem , since we are concerned only with encoded subsystem preservation .",
    "@xmath90 is the projector into the valid subspace defined in ( [ eq : projector ] ) .",
