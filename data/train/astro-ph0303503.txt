    "the current realization of the international celestial reference frame ( icrf ) is defined by the positions of 212 extragalactic objects derived from very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations @xcite .",
    "this vlbi realization of the icrf is currently the international astronomical union ( iau ) sanctioned fundamental astronomical reference frame . at optical wavelengths ,",
    "the hipparcos catalog @xcite now serves as the primary realization of the extragalactic frame .",
    "the link between the hipparcos catalog and the icrf was accomplished through a variety of ground - based and space - based efforts @xcite with the highest weight given to vlbi observations of 12 radio stars by @xcite .",
    "the standard error of the alignment was estimated to be 0.6  mas at epoch 1991.25 , with an estimated error in the system rotation of 0.25  mas  yr@xmath4 per axis .",
    "thus at the epoch of our observations ( 2000.94 ) the alignment of the hipparcos frame and the icrf had a formal error of approximately 2.5  mas .",
    "due to errors in the proper motions , the random position errors of individual hipparcos stars increased from @xmath51  mas in 1991 to @xmath510  mas at the time of our observations .",
    "upcoming astrometric satellite missions such as sim and gaia will likely define frames with internal accuracies that are better than the extragalactic vlbi frame by an order of magnitude , and these frames may define the next generation icrf .    in this paper , we present our observations of 19 radio stars using the very large array ( vla ) in a configuration linked by fiber optic transmission line to the very long baseline array ( vlba ) antenna located in pie town , new mexico . both the vla and vlba",
    "are maintained and operated by the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) .",
    "the vla plus pie town ( vla+pt ) link @xcite is a valuable tool for radio star astrometry because it provides the high sensitivity of the vla with nearly twice the resolution of the vla a - configuration alone for high declination sources . in sections 2 and 3",
    "we describe the observations , reduction of the data , and the methodology used in the determination of source positions and associated errors .",
    "the observations described here represent a continuation of a long - term program ( since 1978 ) to obtain accurate astrometric radio positions , parallaxes , and proper motions for @xmath550 radio stars , which can be used to connect the current icrf to future astrometric satellite reference frames . in section 5",
    "we combine our vla+pt positions with previous positions derived from vla data collected from 1978 through 1995 @xcite .",
    "we derive updated estimates of the proper motions for 15 of the stars observed in both programs , and compare these proper motions with the corresponding hipparcos values .",
    "the vla+pt x - band observations occurred over a 24-hour period beginning 2000 december 10 at 06:30 lst .",
    "the data were recorded in dual circular polarization using two adjacent 50-mhz intermediate frequencies ( if s ) centered on rest frequencies of 8460.1 mhz and 8510.1 mhz respectively .",
    "the distribution on the sky of the 19 radio stars observed is shown in figure [ aitoff ] . for each star ,",
    "two nearby icrf reference sources were observed for phase calibration ( see table [ sources ] ) .",
    "the input positions for the stars were hipparcos values updated to the epoch of our observations using the hipparcos proper motions and parallaxes .",
    "input positions for the icrf reference sources were those given in @xcite . because radio stars are generally weak ( on the order of a few mjy ) and because the goal of our observations was astrometry , negating the use of phase self calibration , we used the fast - switching technique @xcite to observe the star and its primary phase calibrator in an attempt to mitigate phase fluctuations due to the atmosphere / ionosphere .",
    "each fast - switched scan was bracketed by two short scans of a second icrf source which was used as a phase calibration back - up and as a check for the accuracy of the position estimation . over the 24-hour experiment ,",
    "three observations of each radio star were conducted at three different hour angles in order to maximize the @xmath6 coverage . for the discussion presented here ,",
    "an observation is defined as consisting of a short 1.5 minute scan on the secondary phase calibrator , followed by 17.6 minutes of fast switching between the star and the primary phase calibrator with a 2.5 minute cycle time ( 100 seconds on the star and 50 seconds on the calibrator ) , followed by a final 1.5 minute scan on the secondary phase calibrator .",
    "in addition , two 5 minute scans were recorded on the sources 3c48 and 3c147 for use in the absolute flux density calibration .",
    "data were reduced using the standard routines within the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) .",
    "the absolute flux density scale was established using the values calculated by aips for 3c48 and 3c147 ( 3.22  jy and 4.81  jy respectively ) with the proper @xmath6 restrictions applied . for each star ,",
    "two calibrated @xmath6 data sets were generated .",
    "for the first , the phase calibration was accomplished through transfer of the phases of the primary ( fast - switched ) reference source .",
    "a second @xmath6 data set was generated for each star by applying the phases of the second icrf calibrator ( not fast - switched ) bracketing the corresponding star .",
    "each icrf reference source was phase calibrated with the other reference source observed , i.e. the primary was calibrated using the secondary and the secondary calibrated using the primary . at no time was self - calibration performed on any of the data . from the @xmath6 data sets ( two per star and one per calibrator ) , a set of five images were generated for each source : one cleaned image including all observations , one dirty image with all observations , and three dirty images one per observation at the three different hour angles . synthesized beam sizes ranged from approximately @xmath7 for a source at a declination of @xmath8 to @xmath9 for a source at a declination of @xmath10 .",
    "the images produced have 512@xmath11512 pixels with a pixel size of @xmath12 . for the cleaned images",
    "100 iterations were used .",
    "a two - dimensional ( 2-d ) gaussian function was fit to the peak flux in each image using the aips task jmfit .",
    "the results of these fits were used in the derivation of source positions described in the next section .",
    "final estimation of the star and calibrator positions was performed outside of aips using the results of the 2-d gaussian fits to the various images .",
    "peak and rms flux densities for each source were derived from the fits to the cleaned images . to avoid any possible position shifts due to cleaning of the images , positions in right ascension and declination were determined from fits to the dirty images produced from the combined data for each source .",
    "a later comparison showed less than 12  mas differences between the positions derived from the dirty and cleaned images in all but one case .",
    "the star b per , the lowest flux density source observed , had a difference in right ascension of 5 mas , which was still well within the position error reported for this source .",
    "table [ positions ] lists the positions and flux densities determined from the fits to the images of the 19 stars and their associated calibrator sources .",
    "other than the tropospheric delay correction made by the vla on - line system , which assumes a plane parallel slab model based on pressure , temperature and relative humidity measurements made at the vla , no other correction was made for tropospheric / ionospheric effects .",
    "figure  [ eleverror ] plots the position formal errors ( as determined by jmfit ) in @xmath0 and @xmath1 as a function of source elevation for all calibrator and target source observations . as seen in the figure , there is a small rise in position error for sources observed at elevations below about @xmath13 .",
    "we made no attempt to model this phenomenon , but we did attempt to estimate contributions to the position errors due to tropospheric / ionospheric effects , as discussed below .",
    "documentation for the aips task jmfit states that the errors in the position estimates should be regarded as tentative . taking a conservative approach to error determination",
    ", we computed a root - sum - square combination of two separate error estimates .",
    "the first estimate , which is associated with the fitting of a 2-d gaussian function to an image peak , is given by @xmath14 , where snr is the signal - to - noise ratio in the cleaned image and @xmath15 represents the geometric mean of the synthesized beam .",
    "the second estimate , which provides a measure of the uncertainty due to the changing troposphere / ionosphere , is a weighted root - mean - square ( wrms ) position error computed in the following manner . for each individual observation ,",
    "positions and associated errors in right ascension and declination were determined from a 2-d fit to the dirty images at three different hour angles . a wrms position uncertainty",
    "was then computed for each source , with the individual position errors reported by jmfit used as weights .",
    "the final errors reported in table [ positions ] are the combined root - sum - square of the two separate estimates . for most of the stars in our observations ,",
    "the final reported errors were dominated by the wrms uncertainties in the positions , with the errors due to gaussian fitting being a small contributor .    for three of the stars in table [ positions ] , hd50896-n , rs cvn , and hr5110 ,",
    "phase stability was found to be better using the secondary icrf calibrator rather than the primary ( fast - switched ) calibrator as the phase reference source .",
    "therefore , the positions and errors reported for these stars are from the data which were phase - calibrated using the secondary ( not fast - switched ) reference source .",
    "mean values for the position errors for all 19 stars are 10  msec in right ascension , @xmath16 , ( 13  mas in @xmath0 ) and 16  mas in declination , @xmath1 . upon close inspection of table [ positions ] , it is obvious that the errors associated with the star hd50896-n and its two calibrator sources are substantially higher than errors for all of the other sources .",
    "this star was the second lowest declination star in our list , and its primary phase calibrator was the lowest declination source observed .",
    "in addition , one of the scans on this source was taken at a very low elevation ( star at @xmath316@xmath17 and primary phase calibrator at @xmath311@xmath17 ) . disregarding hd50896-n and its associated calibrator sources , decreases the mean errors in the positions for all sources to 12  mas in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the lower limit on the accuracy of the positions for the best icrf calibrators is 0.25  mas @xcite , well below the precision obtained from our vla+pt measurements discussed above .",
    "the icrf coordinates thus provide representative reference positions with which to compare our vla+pt positions .",
    "figures [ icrfvlara ] and [ icrfvladec ] display the results of such a comparison .",
    "differences between the icrf positions and the vla+pt positions for the calibrator sources are plotted as a function of source right ascension in figure [ icrfvlara ] and as a function of source declination in figure [ icrfvladec ] .",
    "error bars in the two figures are those derived for our vla+pt measurements reported in table [ positions ] .",
    "neither figure shows a clear dependence of position offset on source right ascension or declination .",
    "the means of the differences in @xmath0 and @xmath1 are @xmath20.3  mas and @xmath21.0  mas respectively , indicating that systematic effects are negligible .",
    "the standard deviations of the position differences are 17  mas and 11  mas in @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively .",
    "these values are roughly equivalent to the mean position errors for the stars derived above . if we again disregard the two calibrator sources associated with the star hd50896-n then the standard deviations of the differences fall to 10  mas in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "in addition to the comparison of calibrator positions , we also compared the positions of the 19 stars as derived from our vla+pt observations with the corresponding hipparcos positions updated to the epoch of our observations , julian day 2451889 .",
    "figures [ hipvlara ] and [ hipvladec ] plot the position differences for the radio stars as a function of source right ascension ( figure [ hipvlara ] ) and as a function of source declination ( figure [ hipvladec ] ) .",
    "error bars are those derived from our vla+pt observations . from figures [ hipvlara ] and [ hipvladec ] , it is apparent that roughly half of the positions derived from our vla+pt data do not agree with the hipparcos positions to within the uncertainties in our measurements .",
    "the most obvious disagreement is for the star ux ari , for which the differences in @xmath0 and @xmath1 are 84  mas and 42  mas respectively .",
    "the large offsets for ux ari are real , and are discussed in section 6 below .",
    "optical ( hipparcos ) minus radio ( this paper ) position differences ( @xmath18 ) were calculated for the 18 stars on our list ( excluding ux ari ) at our 2000.94 epoch .",
    "the three rotation angles between the optical and radio frames were determined from these data using a weighted least - squares adjustment ( see table [ rot_tab ] ) . for the radio positions",
    ", we used the errors reported in table 2 .",
    "for the optical positions we used the hipparcos errors at epoch ( 1991.25 ) updated to our epoch using the hipparcos proper motion errors .",
    "no significant misalignment of the frames was found to within the formal errors of about 3 mas per axis .",
    "the reduced @xmath19 for the solutions is @xmath31.0 , confirming the error estimates for the input data .",
    "the positions of the 19 radio stars from our vla+pt observations were combined with previous vla observations @xcite to determine stellar proper motions , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , for the 15 sources common to both programs .",
    "although the data cover a long time range , 19782000 , the sampling is not sufficient to enable the determination of source parallaxes .",
    "we therefore computed proper motions for the 15 stars using the parallaxes obtained from hipparcos .",
    "the proper motions derived from the combined vla and vla+pt data are listed in table [ prop_mot_tab ] .",
    "the values listed in columns 3 and 4 of table [ prop_mot_tab ] were computed using a linear least - squares fit to the data weighted by the position errors for each observation .",
    "position errors for the previous vla observations were estimated to be 30  mas in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite and we have adopted these values in our proper motion analysis .",
    "we did not attempt to include accelerations or to model possible companions in wide orbits with the exception of the star ux ari discussed in the next section .",
    "in addition to our vla / vla+pt proper motions , table  [ prop_mot_tab ] lists the proper motions derived from the hipparcos mission and from long - term vlbi observations by @xcite . comparing the various proper motions listed in the table",
    ", one can see that the vla / vla+pt values , with mean errors of 1.44  mas  yr@xmath4 in @xmath20 and 1.79  mas  yr@xmath4 in @xmath21 , are beginning to approach the accuracies of the hipparcos proper motions with mean errors of 0.95  mas  yr@xmath4 and 0.87  mas  yr@xmath4 respectively .",
    "for a few of the stars listed in table  [ prop_mot_tab ] , our proper motion errors are actually smaller than those derived from the hipparcos observations .",
    "comparisons of the vla / vla+pt proper motions with those derived from hipparcos and vlbi data are shown in figures  [ prop_mot_vla ] and [ prop_mot_vlbi ] .",
    "figure  [ prop_mot_vla ] plots the differences between the proper motions in @xmath0 ( @xmath22 ) and @xmath1 ( @xmath23 ) , as derived from our vla / vla+pt observations and those of hipparcos .",
    "the error bars are the root - sum - square of the uncertainties reported for the two sets of proper motions . for six of the 15 stars common to both data sets , proper motions in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are in agreement to within the error bars .",
    "an additional three stars agree in @xmath20 only , four stars agree in @xmath21 only , and two stars do not agree at the 1@xmath24 level .",
    "figure  [ prop_mot_vlbi ] shows a similar comparison of the vla / vla+pt proper motions with those derived from vlbi observations of @xcite . although the errors reported for the vlbi proper motions are significantly smaller than those estimated for the vla / vla+pt data ( see table  [ prop_mot_tab ] ) , the computed proper motions are in complete agreement for four of the six stars common to both experiments .",
    "the other two stars do not agree within the uncertainties in either @xmath20 or @xmath21 .",
    "one of these stars is algol a known ternary , for which we only have 6 data points .",
    "the other star is ux ari which was mentioned previously as having large differences between our vla+pt position and the hipparcos position .",
    "ux ari is discussed in more detail below .",
    "finally , in columns 9 and 10 of table  [ prop_mot_tab ] we combined the vla / vla+pt , hipparcos , and vlbi values by computing weighted mean proper motions and associated errors for each of the 15 stars having vla / vla+pt data .",
    "the combined position was weighted by the errors in the individual proper motions derived from each of the three data sets : vla / vla+pt , hipparcos , and vlbi ( when available ) .",
    "the error in the combined position is just the wrms of the available vla / vla+pt , hipparcos , and/or vlbi errors . because of",
    "the relatively small errors in the vlbi derived proper motions , some of the combined proper motions are heavily weighted toward the vlbi value ( see @xmath25 crb for example ) .",
    "the accuracies of the averaged proper motions exceed those of the vla / vla+pt and hipparcos data alone with average wrms errors of 0.47  mas  yr@xmath4 in @xmath20 and 0.48  mas  yr@xmath4 in @xmath21 .",
    "ux ari is an active rs cvn binary with an orbital period of 6.44 days and an inclination of @xmath360@xmath17 .",
    "despite being the most observed source in our study , the star ux ari exhibited unexpectedly large position offsets between our vla+pt measurements and those derived from the hipparcos mission .",
    "we scrutinized the reduction and analysis of the vla+pt data for ux ari , and could find no errors in the processing .",
    "the positions determined for ux ari when phase - referenced independently to the primary and secondary icrf calibrators agreed to within 10  mas in @xmath0 and 1  mas in @xmath1 . in addition , the vla+pt position of the secondary calibrator phase - referenced to the primary calibrator agreed with the `` true '' icrf position to within 8  mas in @xmath0 and 1  mas in @xmath1 .    figure [ uxari ] plots the 14 astrometric position measurements derived from our vla / vla+pt observations in @xmath0 and @xmath1 from 19782000 . because a linear least - squares fit provided a poor representation of the data , we decided to include acceleration terms in the least - squares fits to the time series for ux ari .",
    "these fits are shown as solid curves in figure [ uxari ] .",
    "central epochs of 1985.2922 in right ascension and 1985.2311 in declination were computed , and the data were fit with a second order polynomial using a weighted least - squares method .",
    "the linear terms in the fits represent the proper motions which are reported in the additional row for ux ari in table  [ prop_mot_tab ] .",
    "the second order terms represent the accelerations obtained from the fit , which are @xmath26  mas  yr@xmath27 in @xmath0 and @xmath28  mas  yr@xmath27 in @xmath1",
    ".    it should not be too surprising that the observed motion for ux ari consists of more than just linear proper motion .",
    "@xcite reported statistically significant accelerations of @xmath29  mas  yr@xmath27 ( 8@xmath24 ) in @xmath0 and @xmath30  mas  yr@xmath27 ( 4@xmath24 ) in @xmath1 for their vlbi observations .",
    "these accelerations are in very good agreement with the accelerations derived from our vla / vla+pt data .",
    "@xcite suggested that these accelerations might be due to the gravitational influence of a companion and , if bound , the wider components should have an orbital period many times the 11-year span of their data .",
    "the rs cvn system does , in fact , have a companion , and ux ari is listed in the washington double star catalog @xcite with the designation wds 03266 + 2843 .",
    "the separation between the rs cvn system and the third star has been measured several times using speckle interferometry , most recently by @xcite who measured a separation of @xmath31 at an epoch of 1996.8658 .",
    "in addition , spectroscopic radial velocity measurements of the rs cvn components by @xcite show a systematic variation of the center of mass velocity with time indicating the influence of a third star .",
    "their preliminary fits to the radial velocity measurements yielded periods of approximately 10.7 and 21.5 years for circular and elliptical orbits respectively .",
    "a fit to the very limited data in the wds ( w. i. hartkopf 2002 , private communication ) yielded an orbital period of @xmath32  yr , a semimajor axis of @xmath33 , and an inclination of @xmath34 for the third component of the system .",
    "this period is significantly longer than those determined from the radial velocity measurements and more in line with expectations given the accelerations derived for the rs cvn system from the vlbi measurements of @xcite and the vla / vla+pt data here .",
    "the inclination angle estimated from the wds data is significantly tilted with respect to inclination angle of the rs cvn orbit of @xmath360@xmath17 . assuming the period and semimajor axis from the wds orbit , the total mass of the system is determined to be @xmath31.9@xmath35 , which is slightly less than the mass of the rs cvn system alone ( @xmath36 ) given in @xcite . a second fit to the wds data assuming an inclination for the outer orbit equal to that of the rs cvn system ( c. a. hummel 2002 , private communication ) yielded a smaller semimajor axis , a shorter period , and an eccentricity close to 1 .",
    "the total mass for this orbit is again less than the assumed mass of the rs cvn component of the system .",
    "the total system masses determined from the fits to the wds data clearly do not agree with the mass of the rs cvn system , and probably reflect limitations in the orbits determined from the sparse data .",
    "additional observations would be very helpful in determining a better orbit for the third component of ux ari and the total mass of the system .",
    "we have determined the astrometric positions for 19 radio stars using the vla+pt configuration .",
    "the positions presented here , with uncertainties on the order of 10 mas or better , represent a factor of three improvement over the previous vla results @xcite .",
    "stellar positions from hipparcos are degrading with time due to errors in the hipparcos proper motions on the order of 1  mas  yr@xmath4 and due to unmodeled rotations in the frame with respect to the extragalactic objects estimated to be 0.25  mas  yr@xmath4 per axis .",
    "taking into account these uncertainties , for many of the stars in our list , our vla+pt positions are better than the corresponding hipparcos positions at epoch .",
    "the proper motions derived from our vla+pt observations combined with previous vla data of @xcite have errors which are on the order of , and in some cases are better than , those obtained from hipparcos .    to our knowledge we provide here the first critical check on the hipparcos frame to icrf alignment after the initial effort in the mid 1990 s .",
    "the formal , predicted error on the frame alignment at our epoch of 2000.94 , thus 9.69 years after the mean hipparcos epoch of 1991.25 , is 2.5 mas .",
    "our observations indicate insignificant alignment rotations of @xmath372.3  mas with a formal error of @xmath33  mas per axis . in a pilot investigation ,",
    "172 extragalactic sources were used to compare the icrf / optical frames ( assafin et al .",
    "2003 , aj , in press ) .",
    "this program yielded similar results with no significant system rotations found and formal errors on the 3  mas level .",
    "however , systematic errors in the preliminary , wide - field , optical data of @xmath310  mas were reported . for determining possible radio / optical frame differences",
    "the use of radio stars is currently more competitive because the accurate hipparcos data can be utilized directly .",
    "although future astrometric satellite missions will likely observe distant extragalactic objects directly to provide a tie to the radio reference frame , astrometric observations of radio stars will still provide an important verification of such a link as demonstrated here .",
    "it is possible that on the proposed microarcsecond scales measurable by future astrometric satellites , the extragalactic sources may have significant time dependent source structure affecting quasar optical positions .",
    "this is indeed the case on milliarcsecond levels at radio wavelengths as shown by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the vla+pt configuration provides a useful tool for radio - star astrometry because of its ability to do both high resolution and high sensitivity observations at the same time .",
    "compared with the 24 hour vla+pt observing time , the same 19 stars plus phase calibrator sources would have taken on the order of 120 hours of time on the vlba . to observe the 50 stars in the @xcite list at multiple epochs using",
    "the vlba would require a tremendous allocation of time , and such a project is probably impractical .",
    "clearly additional observations are necessary to update the positions and proper motions of the 50 radio stars previously observed with the vla especially since the vla+pt configuration offers a factor of three improvement over the previous measurements .",
    "additional observations , with better sampling in time , will also enable the determination of the parallaxes directly from the radio data .",
    "there are several areas in which we might extend or improve our radio - star astrometry in future experiments .",
    "as mentioned in section 3 , our use of the dirty rather than cleaned images to determine the positions may have been unnecessarily conservative , since there was little difference between the positions derived from the two sets of images . in figure  [ eleverror ]",
    "there was a slight increase in position error as a function of decreasing source elevation likely due to unmodeled atmospheric and ionospheric effects .",
    "modeling of the phase fluctuations due to these phenomena may result in improved astrometric positions .",
    "observationally , the use of fast - switching and two phase calibrators per target star proved to be beneficial in our analysis of the data and worth the additional observation time . in future experiments , it may be useful to increase the number of observations per star to a number greater than the three we used for this experiment .",
    "for example , @xcite used 56 observations per star in their vla radio - star astrometry .",
    "the three observations per star used here was the result of a compromise between our desire for better @xmath6 coverage and the scheduling constraints imposed by the use of fast - switching and the vla+pt configuration .",
    "finally , the greatest improvements in stellar astrometry at radio wavelengths will likely come from future enhancements to the vla .",
    "the increased sensitivity of phase i of the evla project will extend the total number of stars observable with the vla and will shorten time required to observe these stars .",
