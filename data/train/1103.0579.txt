    "large - scale complex systems , such as , for instance , the electrical power grid and the telecommunication system , are receiving increasing attention from researchers in different fields .",
    "the wide spatial distribution and the high dimensionality of these systems preclude the use of centralized solutions to tackle classical estimation , control , and fault detection problems , and they require , instead , the development of new decentralized techniques .",
    "one possibility to overcome these issues is to geographically deploy some monitors in the network , each one responsible for a different subpart of the whole system .",
    "local estimation and control schemes can successively be used , together with an information exchange mechanism to recover the performance of a centralized scheme .",
    "power systems are operated by system operators from the area control center .",
    "the main goal of the system operator is to maintain the network in a secure operating condition , in which all the loads are supplied power by the generators without violating the operational limits on the transmission lines . in order to accomplish this goal , at a given point in time , the network model and the phasor voltages at every system bus need to be determined , and preventive actions have to be taken if the system is found in an insecure state . for the determination of the operating state , remote terminal units and measuring devices",
    "are deployed in the network to gather measurements .",
    "these devices are then connected via a local area network to a scada ( supervisory control and data acquisition ) terminal , which supports the communication of the collected measurements to a control center . at the control center",
    ", the measurement data is used for control and optimization functions , such as contingency analysis , automatic generation control , load forecasting , optimal power flow computation , and reactive power dispatch @xcite . a diagram representing the interconnections between remote terminal units and the control center",
    "is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : control_center ] .    various sources of uncertainties , e.g. , measurement and communication noise , lead to inaccuracies in the received data , which may affect the performance of the control and optimization algorithms , and , ultimately , the stability of the power plant .",
    "this concern was first recognized and addressed in @xcite by introducing the idea of ( static ) state estimation in power systems .",
    "power network state estimators are broadly used to obtain an optimal estimate from redundant noisy measurements , and to estimate the state of a network branch which , for economical or computational reasons , is not directly monitored . for the power system state estimation problem ,",
    "several centralized and parallel solutions have been developed in the last decades , e.g. , see @xcite . being an online function , computational issues , storage requirements , and numerical robustness of the solution algorithm need to be taken into account . within this regard , distributed algorithms based on network",
    "partitioning techniques are to be preferred over centralized ones .",
    "moreover , even in decentralized setting , the work in @xcite on the blackout of august 2003 suggests that an estimation of the entire network is essential to prevent networks damages .",
    "in other words , the whole state vector should be estimated by and available to every unit .",
    "the references @xcite explore the idea of using a global control center to coordinate estimates obtained locally by several local control centers . in this work ,",
    "we improve upon these prior results by proposing a fully decentralized and distributed estimation algorithm , which , by only assuming local knowledge of the network structure by the local control centers , allows them to obtain in finite time an optimal estimate of the network state . being the computation distributed among the control centers , our procedure appears scalable against the power network dimension , and , furthermore , numerically reliable and accurate .",
    "a second focus of this paper is false data detection and cyber attacks in power systems . because of the increasing reliance of modern power systems on communication networks , the possibility of cyber attacks is a real threat @xcite .",
    "one possibility for the attacker is to corrupt the data coming from the measuring units and directed to the control center , in order to introduce arbitrary errors in the estimated state , and , consequently , to compromise the performance of control and optimization algorithms @xcite . this important type of attack is often referred in the power systems literature to as _ false data injection attack_. recently , the authors of @xcite show that a false data injection attack , in addition to destabilizing the grid , may also lead to fluctuations in the electricity market , causing significant economical losses .",
    "the presence of false data is classically checked by analyzing the statistical properties of the _ estimation residual _",
    "@xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the measurements vector , @xmath2 is a state estimate , and @xmath3 is the state to measurements matrix . for an attack to be successful ,",
    "the residual needs to remain within a certain confidence level . accordingly",
    ", one approach to circumvent false data injection attacks is to increase the number of measurements so as to obtain a more accurate confidence bound . clearly , by increasing the number of measurements , the data to be transmitted to the control center increases , and the dimension of the estimation problem grows . by means of our estimation method",
    ", we address this dimensionality problem by distributing the false data detection problem among several control centers .      starting from the eighties ,",
    "the problem of distributed estimation has attracted intense attention from the scientific community , generating along the years a very rich literature .",
    "more recently , because of the advent of highly integrated and low - cost wireless devices as key components of large autonomous networks , the interest for this classical topic has been renewed . for a wireless sensor network ,",
    "novel applications requiring efficient distributed estimation procedures include , for instance , environment monitoring , surveillance , localization , and target tracking .",
    "considerable effort has been devoted to the development of distributed and adaptive filtering schemes , which generalize the notion of adaptive estimation to a setup involving networked sensing and processing devices @xcite . in this context ,",
    "relevant methods include incremental least mean - square @xcite , incremental recursive least - square @xcite , diffusive least mean - square @xcite , and diffusive recursive least - square@xcite .",
    "diffusion kalman filtering and smoothing algorithms are proposed , for instance , in @xcite , and consensus based techniques in @xcite .",
    "we remark that the strategies proposed in the aforementioned references could be adapted for the solution of the power network static estimation problem .",
    "their assumptions , however , appear to be not well suited in our context for the following reasons .",
    "first , the convergence of the above estimation algorithms is only asymptotic , and it depends upon the communication topology . as a matter of fact , for many communication topologies , such as cayley graphs and random geometric graphs , the convergence rate is very slow and scales badly with the network dimension .",
    "such slow convergence rate is clearly undesirable because a delayed state estimation could lead the power plant to instability .",
    "second , approaches based on kalman filtering require the knowledge of the global state and observation model by all the components of the network , and they violate therefore our assumptions .",
    "third and finally , the application of these methods to the detection of cyber attacks , which is also our goal , is not straightforward , especially when detection guarantees are required . an exception is constituted by @xcite , where a estimation technique based on local kalman filters and a consensus strategy is developed .",
    "this latter method , however , besides exhibiting asymptotic convergence , does not offer guarantees on the final estimation error .",
    "our estimation technique belongs to the family of kaczmarz ( row - projection ) methods for the solution of a linear system of equations .",
    "see @xcite for a detailed discussion .",
    "differently from the existing row - action methods , our algorithms exhibit finite time convergence towards the exact solution , and they can be used to compute any weighted least squares solution to a system of linear equations .      the contributions of this work are threefold .",
    "first , we adopt the static state network estimation model , in which the state vector is linearly related to the network measurements .",
    "we develop two methods for a group of interconnected control centers to compute an optimal estimate of the system state via distributed computation .",
    "our first estimation algorithm assumes an _ incremental _ mode of cooperation among the control centers , while our second estimation algorithm is based upon a _ diffusive _ strategy .",
    "both methods are shown to converge in a finite number of iterations , and to require only local information for their implementation . differently than @xcite ,",
    "our estimation procedures assume neither the measurement error covariance nor the measurements matrix to be diagonal .",
    "furthermore , our algorithms are advantageous from a communication perspective , since they reduce the distance between remote terminal units and the associated control center , and from a computational perspective , since they distribute the measurements to be processed among the control centers .",
    "second , as a minor contribution , we describe a finite - time algorithm to detect via distributed computation if the measurements have been corrupted by a malignant agent .",
    "our detection method is based upon our state estimation technique , and it inherits its convergence properties .",
    "notice that , since we assume the measurements to be corrupted by noise , the possibility exists for an attacker to compromise the network measurements while remaining undetected ( by injecting for instance a vector with the same noise statistics ) .",
    "with respect to this limitation , we characterize the class of corrupted vectors that are guaranteed to be detected by our procedure , and we show optimality with respect to a centralized detection algorithm .",
    "third , we study the scalability of our methods in networks of increasing dimension , and we derive a finite - memory approximation of our diffusive estimation strategy . for this approximation procedure",
    "we show that , under a reasonable set of assumptions and independent of the network dimension , each control center is able to recover a good approximation of the state of a certain subnetwork through little computation .",
    "moreover , we provide bounds on the approximation error for each subnetwork .",
    "finally , we illustrate the effectiveness of our procedures on the ieee 118 bus system .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : setup ] we introduce the problem under consideration , and we describe the mathematical setup .",
    "section [ sec : solver ] contains our main results on the state estimation and on the detection problem , as well as our algorithms .",
    "section [ sec : approximate ] describes our approximated state estimation algorithm . in section",
    "[ sec : numerical ] we study the ieee 118 bus system , and we present some simulation results .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusion ] contains our conclusion .",
    "for a power network , an example of which is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : power_network118 ] , the state at a certain instant of time consists of the voltage angles and magnitudes at all the system buses .",
    "the ( static ) state estimation problem introduced in the seminal work by schweppe @xcite refers to the procedure of estimating the state of a power network given a set of measurements of the network variables , such as , for instance , voltages , currents , and power flows along the transmission lines . to be more precise ,",
    "let @xmath4 and @xmath5 be , respectively , the state and measurements vector .",
    "then , the vectors @xmath6 and @xmath1 are related by the relation @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a nonlinear measurement function , and where @xmath9 , which is traditionally assumed to be a zero mean random vector satisfying @xmath10 = \\sigma_{\\eta } = \\sigma_{\\eta}^{\\mathsf{t}}>0 $ ] , is the noise measurement .",
    "an optimal estimate of the network state coincides with the _ most likely _ vector @xmath2 that solves equation .",
    "it should be observed that , instead of by solving the above estimation problem , the network state could be obtained by measuring directly the voltage phasors by means of phasor measurement devices .",
    "such an approach , however , would be economically expensive , since it requires to deploy a phasor measurement device at each network bus , and it would be very vulnerable to communication failures @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we adopt the approximated estimation model presented in @xcite , which follows from the linearization around the origin of equation .",
    "specifically , @xmath11 where @xmath12 and where @xmath13 , the noise measurement , is such that @xmath14 = 0 $ ] and@xmath15 = \\sigma = \\sigma^{\\mathsf{t}}>0 $ ] .",
    "observe that , because of the interconnection structure of a power network , the measurement matrix @xmath3 is usually sparse .",
    "let @xmath16 denote the null space defined by the matrix @xmath3 .",
    "for the equation , without affecting generality , assume @xmath17 , and recall from @xcite that the vector @xmath18 minimizes the weighted variance of the estimation error , i.e. , @xmath19 .    the centralized computation of the minimum variance estimate to assumes the complete knowledge of the matrices @xmath3 and @xmath20 , and it requires the inversion of the matrix @xmath21 . for a large power network ,",
    "such computation imposes a limitation on the dimension of the matrix @xmath3 , and hence on the number of measurements that can be efficiently processed to obtain a real - time state estimate .",
    "since the performance of network control and optimization algorithms depend upon the precision of the state estimate , a limitation on the network measurements constitutes a bottleneck toward the development of a more efficient power grid . a possible solution to address this complexity problem is to distribute the computation of @xmath22 among geographically deployed control centers ( monitors ) , in a way that each monitor is responsible for a subpart of the whole network .",
    "to be more precise , let the matrices @xmath3 and @xmath20 , and the vector @xmath1 be partitioned as is very sparse .",
    "however , we do not impose any particular structure on the error covariance matrix . ]",
    "@xmath23,\\quad    \\sigma=\\left [      \\begin{array}{c }        \\sigma_1\\\\        \\sigma_2\\\\        \\vdots\\\\        \\sigma_m      \\end{array }    \\right],\\quad    z=\\left [      \\begin{array}{c }        z_1\\\\        z_2\\\\        \\vdots\\\\        z_m      \\end{array }    \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , for @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath30 be a connected graph in which each vertex @xmath31 denotes a monitor , and @xmath32 denotes the set of monitors interconnections . for @xmath33 , assume that monitor @xmath34 knows the matrices @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and the vector @xmath37 .",
    "moreover , assume that two neighboring monitors are allowed to cooperate by exchanging information .",
    "notice that , if the full matrices @xmath3 and @xmath20 are nowhere available , and if they can not be used for the computation of @xmath22 , then , with no cooperation among the monitors , the vector @xmath22 can not be computed by any of the monitor . hence we consider the following problem .",
    "design an algorithm for the monitors to compute the minimum variance estimate of the network state via distributed computation .",
    "we now introduce the second problem addressed in this work . given the distributed nature of a power system and the increasing reliance on local area networks to transmit data to a control center , there exists the possibility for an attacker to compromise the network functionality by corrupting the measurements vector .",
    "when a malignant agent corrupts some of the measurements , the state to measurements relation becomes @xmath38 where the vector @xmath39 is chosen by the attacker , and , therefore , it is unknown and unmeasurable by any of the monitoring stations .",
    "we refer to the vector @xmath40 to as _ false _ data . from the above equation , it should be observed that there exist vectors @xmath40 that can not be detected through the measurements @xmath1 .",
    "for instance , if the false data vector is intentionally chosen such that @xmath41 , then the attack can not be detected through the measurements @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , denoting with @xmath42 the pseudoinverse operation , the vector @xmath43 is a valid network state . in this work",
    ", we assume that the vector @xmath40 is detectable from the measurements @xmath1 , and we consider the following problem .",
    "design an algorithm for the monitors to detect the presence of false data in the measurements via distributed computation .",
    "as it will be clear in the sequel , the complexity of our methods depends upon the dimension of the state , as well as the number of monitors .",
    "in particular , few monitors should be used in the absence of severe computation and communication contraints , while many monitors are preferred otherwise .",
    "we believe that a suitable choice of the number of monitors depends upon the specific scenario , and it is not further discussed in this work .",
    "in this paper we focus on the state estimation and the false data detection problem for power systems , because this field of research is currently receiving sensible attention from different communities .",
    "the methods described in the following sections , however , are general , and they have applicability beyond the power network scenario .",
    "for instance , our procedures can be used for state estimation and false data detection in dynamical system , as described in @xcite for the case of sensors networks .",
    "the objective of this section is the design of distributed methods to compute an optimal state estimate from measurements . with respect to a centralized method ,",
    "in which a powerful central processor is in charge of processing all the data , our procedures require the computing units to have access to only a subset of the measurements , and are shown to reduce significantly the computational burden .",
    "in addition to being convenient for the implementation , our methods are also optimal , in the sense that they maintain the same estimation accuracy of a centralized method .    for a distributed method to be implemented ,",
    "the interaction structure among the computing units needs to be defined .",
    "here we consider two modes of cooperations among the computing units , and , namely , the _ incremental _ and the _ diffusive _ interaction . in an incremental mode of cooperation , information flows in a sequential manner from one node to the adjacent one .",
    "this setting , which usually requires the least amount of communications @xcite , induces a cyclic interaction graph among the processors . in a diffusive strategy ,",
    "instead , each node exchanges information with all ( or a subset of ) its neighbors as defined by an interaction graph . in this case",
    ", the amount of communication and computation is higher than in the incremental case , but each node possesses a good estimate before the termination of the algorithm , since it improves its estimate at each communication round .",
    "this section is divided into three parts . in section [ subsec :",
    "solver ] , we first develop a distributed incremental method to compute the minimum norm solution to a set of linear equations , and then exploit such method to solve a minimum variance estimation problem . in section [ sec : asynchronous ] we derive a diffusive strategy which is amenable to asynchronous implementation .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : detection ] we propose a distributed algorithm for the detection of false data among the measurements .",
    "our detection procedure requires the computation of the minimum variance state estimate , for which either the incremental or the diffusive strategy can be used .",
    "we start by introducing a distributed incremental procedure to compute the minimum norm solution to a set of linear equations .",

    "<S> this work presents a distributed method for control centers to monitor the operating condition of a power network , i.e. , to estimate the network state , and to ultimately determine the occurrence of threatening situations . </S>",
    "<S> state estimation has been recognized to be a fundamental task for network control centers to ensure correct and safe functionalities of power grids . </S>",
    "<S> we consider ( static ) state estimation problems , in which the state vector consists of the voltage magnitude and angle at all network buses . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the state to be linearly related to network measurements , which include power flows , current injections , and voltages phasors at some buses . </S>",
    "<S> we admit the presence of several cooperating control centers , and we design two distributed methods for them to compute the minimum variance estimate of the state given the network measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the two distributed methods rely on different modes of cooperation among control centers : in the first method an _ incremental _ mode of cooperation is used , whereas , in the second method , a _ diffusive _ interaction is implemented . </S>",
    "<S> our procedures , which require each control center to know only the measurements and structure of a subpart of the whole network , are computationally efficient and scalable with respect to the network dimension , provided that the number of control centers also increases with the network cardinality . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , a _ finite - memory _ approximation of our diffusive algorithm is proposed , and its accuracy is characterized . finally , our estimation methods are exploited to develop a distributed algorithm to detect corrupted data among the network measurements .        ,    , </S>"
