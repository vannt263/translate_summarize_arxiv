    "in the investigation of many astrophysical entities such as primordial universe , main path stellar evolution , novae , super - novae explosion , x - ray bursts etc . , the important input parameter in the models is the cross sections of the capture reactions as a function of energy .",
    "however , since in many of these environments the temperature is not very high , the cross sections have to be obtained at the `` _ gamow peak _",
    "'' energies which are very low , in the range of few tens to at most hundreds of kevs . whereas some of the cross sections originate from laboratory measurements , the majority are based on extrapolations from the higher to lower energies or are obtained by pure theoretical models with , sometimes , no firm experimental basis .",
    "some reactions are practically impossible to be directly measured .",
    "for instance , for light radioactive nuclei nucleosynthesis , the neutron capture reaction is impossible because the combination of target+beam is not possible .",
    "a typical case is the @xmath0li(n,@xmath2)@xmath8li capture reaction where direct measurement is not possible because no @xmath0li or neutron target exist . for proton capture reactions involving radioactive nuclei such as @xmath0b or @xmath7be ,",
    "the direct measurement is very difficult due to the low cross sections and limited beam intensities of these elements . for such cases , indirect methods to determine the cross sections",
    "were developed and are quite usually adopted .",
    "extrapolation from higher energy data to lower regime is also not straight forward .",
    "careful and accurate account of physically relevant information has to be considered in the description of the reaction before the extrapolation is performed , where to describe capture reactions not only information on the structure of the nuclei , but also a clear understanding of the reaction mechanism is required .",
    "many indirect methods have been developed to overcame the difficulties to obtain low energies cross sections . among these methods we have the coulomb dissociation method , which corresponds to the inverse temporal reaction of the capture @xcite , the trojan horse method @xcite , the reduced - width or anc ( asymptotic normalization coefficient ) method @xcite and potential model , where the latter two use transfer reactions as a way to get information on the non - resonant part of the capture reaction process and will be discussed in more detail in the next section .",
    "these indirect methods are very suitable to be used in association with low - energy radioactive nuclear beams .",
    "to overcame the a=8 gap and synthetize heavier elements the key nuclei are the light radioactive elements @xmath0li(178 ms ) and @xmath0b(770 ms ) .",
    "these elements are important for instance in the inhomogeneous big - bang nucleosynthesis ( ibbn ) @xcite . because of the assumption of homogeneous baryon density distribution and also the instability of @xmath0be , the nuclear reaction flows stop at a=8 in sbbn ( standard big bang nucleosynthesis ) . in ibbn",
    "the baryon density distribution is assumed to be inhomogeneous due to several cosmological processes before an onset of primordial nucleosynthesis .",
    "a difference in diffusion between protons and neutrons makes high density zones proton - rich and low density zones neutron - rich .",
    "in such an environment , heavy elements can be produced via the formation proton or neutron rich unstable nuclei .",
    "also it is believed that in supermassive stars with low metalicity , the 3@xmath10 capture process can not form enough @xmath11c to initiate the rapid hydrogen burning during the explosion . however , in such high temperature and densities the hot @xmath12-chain my bypass the slower 3@xmath10 capture @xcite and in this case @xmath0b plays an important role .",
    "the following nuclear reaction chains were found to be very important in nucleosynthesis processes discussed above to jump the a=8 gap and synthetise heavier elements :    * chain ( 1 ) : * @xmath7li(n,@xmath2)@xmath0li(@xmath10,n)@xmath13b(n,@xmath2)@xmath11b(e@xmath14)@xmath11c .",
    "* chain ( 2 ) : * @xmath7li(n,@xmath2)@xmath0li(n,@xmath2)@xmath8li(e@xmath14)@xmath15be(n,@xmath2)@xmath16be(e@xmath14)@xmath16b(n,@xmath2)@xmath13b(n,@xmath2)@xmath11b(e@xmath14)@xmath11c",
    ".    * chain ( 3 ) : * @xmath7be(p,@xmath2)@xmath0b(@xmath10,p)@xmath13c(e@xmath17)@xmath13b(p,@xmath2)@xmath11c .",
    "* chain ( 4 ) : * @xmath7be(p,@xmath2)@xmath0b(@xmath10,p)@xmath13c(p,@xmath2)@xmath11n(@xmath18)@xmath11c .    * chain ( 5 ) : * @xmath7be(p,@xmath2)@xmath0b(p,@xmath2)@xmath15c(@xmath10,p)@xmath11n(@xmath18)@xmath11c .",
    "the first two reaction chains play the central role in the production of neutron - rich nuclei , and the chains ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) of proton - rich nuclei . the @xmath0li(n,@xmath2)@xmath15li is also an important reaction in the early stage of the ignition of supernovae ,",
    "where two neutrons capture reactions,@xmath8li(2n,@xmath2)@xmath13li and @xmath19he(2n,@xmath2)@xmath20he(@xmath18)@xmath0li , may become important .",
    "the @xmath21be(p,@xmath2)@xmath20b is related to the solar neutrino problem .",
    "precise predictions of the production rate of @xmath0b solar neutrinos are important for testing solar models , and for limiting the allowed neutrino mixing parameters .",
    "this , however , it the most uncertain reaction leading to @xmath0b formation in the sun @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0b(p,@xmath2)@xmath15c , capture reaction is also important in the novae environment where temperatures are several times larger than @xmath22 k , corresponding to gamow window energies around @xmath23 kev @xcite .",
    "cross sections for many of the neutron and proton capture reactions by light radioactive nuclei are still poorly known or remain unmeasured at the required low energy region . for systems which can not be measured directly at low energies some procedures or methods are adopted to obtain cross sections in this region .",
    "the most obvious way to obtain the low energy cross section is the extrapolation to low energy through polynomial parametrization of the available high energy region data .",
    "actually these extrapolations are performed to the @xmath24-factor where the strong energy dependence of charged particle capture reactions due to the coulomb barrier penetration are removed .",
    "thus , the cross sections are conventionally expressed in terms of the @xmath24-factor which is defined as :    @xmath25 \\hspace{1 cm } { \\rm with } \\hspace{1 cm } \\eta(e)=z_{a}z_{b}e^{2}/\\hbar v,\\ ] ]    where @xmath26 is the initial relative velocity between the nucleus and proton .",
    "however , the @xmath24-factor does not remove completely the energy dependence , the structure of the final bound state , resonances and attenuation of the barrier by the nuclear mean field can give an extra energy dependency .",
    "the problem is that the extrapolation is not usually a straight forward procedure and some physics has to be taken into account .",
    "for example , for some systems there is an upturn in the @xmath24-factor at very low energy due to a pole at threshold when the photon energy of a @xmath27 capture reaction vanishes .",
    "this is a quite common feature and a straight line extrapolation of @xmath28 from the high energy data region to @xmath29 would not work .",
    "according to jennings _",
    "@xcite , the presence of the pole suggests the @xmath24-factor may be parametrized as laurent series @xmath30 , and they propose the following expression to parametrize the @xmath24-factor :    @xmath31    a good test for this assumption is the investigation of the low energy region of the @xmath1o(p,@xmath2)@xmath3f capture reaction .",
    "this reaction is an important reaction in the cno cycle of our sun but also in evolutionary phase referred as the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) of some massive stars @xcite .",
    "a very good and precise set of data has been obtained for this reaction for both ground - state ( 5/2@xmath5 ) and first excited state ( 1/2@xmath5 ) transitions of @xmath3f , as can be seen in figure 1 . in the figure the upturn for the reaction leading to the @xmath32 excited state is very clear .",
    "let s consider only the data from rolfs @xcite of the transition to the @xmath3f@xmath33(5/2 + ) ground - state . by fitting the data with the expression with pole effect and by a straight line we get the following parameters , respectively : +",
    "* a ) * @xmath34 , giving @xmath29=1.326 and @xmath35=0.194    * b ) * @xmath36 , which gives @xmath29=0.66 and @xmath35=0.305    as we can see a very different value for @xmath29 is obtained depending on the extrapolation performed . the solution for this problem is including more physics in the extrapolation to better determine the @xmath24-factor at low energies .",
    "this can be better done with another @xmath37 method called r - matrix @xcite .",
    "the idea of the r - matrix calculations is to parameterize the cross sections with a small number of parameters and then used to extrapolate the cross section down to astrophysical energies .",
    "since it deals with resonances in the continuum , it can be considered , to some extent , a generalization of the breit - wigner formalism .",
    "the r - matrix framework assumes that the space is divided into internal region ( with radius match @xmath38 ) , where nuclear forces are important , and the external region , where the interaction between the nuclei is governed by the coulomb force only . for more details of this method",
    "we recommend the work of p. descouvemont in ref .",
    "this method , however , has some limitations .",
    "it does nt work for all systems , the radius match @xmath38 is not clearly determined ( usually it is arbitrary chosen ) and it is valid only for low level density composite nuclei .",
    "moreover , it has adjusted parameters which not always has a clear physical meaning .",
    "other possibility is to use what we call @xmath39 methods .",
    "these other methods are related to theoretical calculations and they determine the cross sections from wave functions with , in principle , no data is required . among these methods we have the microscopic cluster models and microscopic @xmath40 models . in the first , a many - body hamiltonian with embedded cluster are involved in a more complex calculations .",
    "internal structure has to be taken into account and the resonating group method can be applied . in the second ,",
    "even more complicate calculations are involved since continuum states , which are very difficult to take into account , have to be considered .",
    "applications of these two calculations to the cases of @xmath7li(n,@xmath2)@xmath0li and @xmath7be(p,@xmath2)@xmath0b capture reactions can be seen in ref .",
    "another method also considered as @xmath39 method is the potential model , where anc ( asymptotic normalization coefficient ) can be considered as an approximation .",
    "this method is quite simple to solve numerically since no structure of the colliding nuclei has to be taken into account .",
    "in the potential model , the direct radiative capture ( drc ) of an @xmath41- and/or @xmath42-wave nucleon ( proton or neutron ) by a nucleus @xmath43 , proceeding via e1 transition and leaving the compound nucleus @xmath44 in its ground state , is given by :    @xmath45 is the wave number corresponding to a @xmath2-ray energy @xmath46 , @xmath47 stands for the electric dipole operator , the initial - state wave function @xmath48 is the incoming nucleon wave function in the nucleon - nucleus potential and @xmath49 is wave function which describes the single - particle bound state .",
    "although the potential model works well for many nuclear reactions of interest in astrophysics , it is often necessary to pursue a more microscopic approach to reproduce experimental data . in a microscopic approach , instead of",
    "the single - particle wave functions one often makes use of overlap integrals , @xmath50 , and a many - body wave function for the relative motion , @xmath51 .",
    "the effect of many - body will eventually disappear at large distances between the nucleon and the nucleus .",
    "one thus expects that the overlap function asymptotically matches the solution of the schrdinger equation , with @xmath52 ( pure coulomb ) for protons and @xmath53 for neutrons .",
    "this assumption may be true only for a very peripheral capture reaction .",
    "this approximation , when @xmath54 , is called anc ( asymptotic normalization coefficient ) and :    @xmath55    where the binding energy of the @xmath56 system is related to @xmath57 by means of @xmath58 , @xmath59 is the whittaker function and anc is the asymptotic normalization coefficient .",
    "the @xmath60 can be obtained from peripheral transfer reactions whose amplitudes contain the same overlap function as the amplitude of the corresponding capture reaction of interest @xcite .    in terms of overlap",
    "integral the direct capture cross sections are obtained from the calculation of    @xmath61    however , it has been shown that @xmath41-wave neutron capture , even at rather low energies , is not peripheral @xcite and so it is necessary to calculate the wave function of the incoming neutron or proton and the wave function for the bound system .",
    "thus , in the potential model , it is necessary to calculate the overlap function also taking into account the internal part of the nuclear potential , i@xmath62=@xmath63 . here , @xmath64 is the spectroscopic amplitude and @xmath65 is the wave - function which describes the bound state",
    ".    in the potential model , the continuum wave function , @xmath48 , has to be calculated with a potential which includes also the nuclear interaction .",
    "thus , the essential ingredients in the potential model are the potentials used to generate the wave functions @xmath48 and @xmath66 , and the normalization for the latter which is given by its spectroscopic factor . here",
    "we use a woods - saxon ( ws ) parameterization to build up the potentials @xmath67 and @xmath68 , where for the latter we consider the derivative of the ws form factor . the parameters @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 @xmath73 , and @xmath74 are chosen to reproduce the ground state energy @xmath75 ( or the energy of an excited state ) . for this purpose , we define typical values ( table i ) for @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 @xmath73 , and vary only the depth of the central potential , @xmath69 . a different set of potential depths might be used for continuum states . to calculate the non - resonant part of these capture reactions in the framework of the potential model we used the computer code radcap developed by bertulani @xcite .",
    "we have tested this potential model by determining the @xmath1o(p,@xmath2)@xmath3f@xmath4 , and @xmath1o(p,@xmath2)@xmath3f@xmath76 @xmath24-factor as a function of energy . in table - i",
    "we list all the parameters of the potentials used to generate the incoming and bound wave functions .",
    "all the potentials were assumed to be a woods - saxon shape with geometric parameters @xmath77 and @xmath78 fm .",
    "the @xmath79 ground state ( @xmath80 excited state ) of @xmath3f is described as a @xmath81 proton ( @xmath82 proton ) coupled to the @xmath1o core , which has an intrinsic spin @xmath83 .",
    "the gamma - ray transitions are dominated by the @xmath84 multipolarity and by incoming @xmath85 waves for both states . the m1 and e2 contributions amount to less than @xmath86 of the dominant e1 contribution , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite where a potential model was also used . the spin - orbit potential depth @xmath87 mev and the spectroscopic factor @xmath88 have been used for both states , although @xmath89 and @xmath88 for the ground state and the excited state , respectively , are recommended by rolfs in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand , iliadis _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite recommend values close to unity .",
    "the continuum states potential depth are set as the same as that of bound states , since no elastic scattering data is known for this system .",
