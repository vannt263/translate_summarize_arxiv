    "however , if nsis are related to the underlying new physics , then they should be considered as a first order term in the perturbation series and not in the zeroth order@xcite . to reiterate this ,",
    "we know the nsi parameters are related to the new physics scale in the form @xmath31 , where @xmath32 signifies the new physics scale .",
    "so if we consider the new physics scale to be around a few tev , then the nsi parameters should not be greater than a few percent . in general the nsi parameters",
    "can be categorized into two different parts .",
    "one is the nsi during propagation , and the other being nsi at the source and at the detector .",

    "<S> we study the possible constraints on non - standard interaction(nsis ) in a model independent way by considering the recent results from t2k and daya bay neutrino oscillations experiments . using perturbation method we present generic formulas ( suitable for t2k baseline and for large @xmath0 as evident from daya bay ) for the probability of oscillation for @xmath1 , taking into account nsis at source ( @xmath2 ) , detector ( @xmath3 ) and during propagation ( @xmath4 ) of neutrinos through matter . </S>",
    "<S> two separate cases of perturbation with small ( slightly large ) nsi ( @xmath5 ) are discussed in detail . using various possible presently allowed nsi values </S>",
    "<S> we reanalyze numerically the @xmath6 allowed region given by recent t2k experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain model independent constraints on nsis in the @xmath7 plane using the @xmath0 value as measured by daya bay , where @xmath8 is the cp violating phase . depending on @xmath8 values significant constraints on @xmath9 and @xmath10 , in particular , </S>",
