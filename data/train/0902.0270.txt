    "electron spin dynamics in semiconductors has experienced a dramatic revival of interest in the last decade due to the promise of semiconductor - based spintronics applications .",
    "@xcite in contrast to magneto - electronic systems involving metallic multilayers , semiconductors are better suited for the fabrication of integrated electronic and opto - electronic devices , but in non - ferromagnetic semiconductors the spin is not a conserved quantity due to the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "thus an understanding of spin relaxation in semiconductors is essential , because it limits all information processing and storage using electronic spins .",
    "the renewed interest in combination with improved experimental techniques has led to important new results .",
    "for instance , long spin dephasing times in n - doped gaas at low temperatures and low carrier densities have been measured using time - resolved faraday rotation ( fr ) techniques .",
    "@xcite very recently , the technique of spin noise measurements has provided a new tool for the determination of `` intrinsic '' spin relaxation times without electrical or optical carrier injection .",
    "@xcite these measurements show , for instance , the importance of a metal - insulator transition on the spin relaxation at low temperatures .",
    "however , the foundation for the theoretical explanation of these experiments above the transition temperature was already laid by an analysis of dyakonov and perel ( dp )  @xcite who showed that in n - doped gaas the decay of spin polarization occurs through the dephasing of the spin coherence in a spatially inhomogeneous effective magnetic field provided by the band structure .",
    "although these `` non - invasive '' experimental techniques yield important results ,  @xcite one may also be interested in the excitation of appreciable spin - polarized carrier densities by optical or electronic means .",
    "existing studies , which address these questions , have concentrated on the electron spin dynamics in n - doped gaas - based semiconductors under electrical bias and hanle effect measurements on a timescale of several hundred picoseconds .",
    "@xcite    this paper is concerned with an investigation of the spin - dephasing dynamics in n - doped bulk gaas after the excitation of spin - polarized carrier densities by ultrashort optical pulses . for a wide range of doping densities , we present a detailed comparison between time - resolved fr measurements and a microscopic theory , which is based on the original dp analysis . our approach to compute the spin - dephasing time does not require the determination of auxiliary quantities , such as an effective momentum scattering time , which is often employed to achieve agreement with experiment .",
    "@xcite instead , the equations of motion for the spin and momentum - resolved electronic distribution functions are solved numerically including the relevant effects of the band - structure and the scattering of electrons with other electrons , phonons , and impurities .",
    "@xcite due to the numerical complexity of calculating the spin dynamics in _ bulk _ gaas , theoretical results so far have concentrated on the microscopic spin dynamics in low - dimensional semiconductors ,  @xcite with the exception of recent work ,  @xcite or on accurate calculations of the analytical dp results for the spin decay .",

    ", the electronic energy dispersions are given by @xmath25 with the electron effective mass @xmath26 .",
    "an important step for the numerical solution of eq .   for _ bulk _ gaas is to account for the strongly anisotropic intrinsic magnetic field @xmath27 by an expansion of @xmath10 in a set of orthonormal functions @xmath28 .",
    "such an expansion was already used in ref .",
    "but , in contrast to the original treatment , we choose an expansion in functions that describe the angular dependence of @xmath29 most accurately , namely : @xmath30 and @xmath31 where the components of the intrinsic magnetic field are given by @xmath32 with a material specific constant  @xmath33 .",
    "@xcite    before we turn to the numerical results from this theory , which describes nonequilibrium spin dynamics due to the dyakonov - perel mechanism , it should be noted that there exists a variety of effects which lead to relaxation and dephasing of spin polarizations in gaas .",
    "however , in moderately n - doped gaas at low temperatures under elevated optical excitation conditions , the dyakonov - perel mechanism is dominant .",
    "the quantitative agreement between the parameter free microscopic calculation and the faraday rotation measurements additionally , presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , supports this point of view .",
    "for definiteness , we mention the following competing processes : besides the intrinsic magnetic field @xmath29 , the @xmath34-factor dispersion of electrons in gaas  @xcite leads to additional dephasing .",
    "we neglect this effect because the optically excited spin polarization is due to electrons in a small energy interval above the fermi energy ( less than 10mev ) . in this region",
    "the spread of rotation frequencies due to the @xmath34-factor dispersion @xmath35 is typically one order of magnitude smaller than the internal magnetic fields @xmath36 .",
    "thus the dephasing due to the @xmath34-factor dispersion is of minor importance for the theoretical analysis of the experiments presented in this paper .",
    "the bir - aronov - pikus mechanisms usually acts on a longer timescale for the relatively low density of optically excited holes and therefore does not play a dominant role , either .",

    "we have performed ultrafast fr measurements to determine the electron spin dynamics in n - doped bulk gaas layers .",
    "@xcite the doped gaas wafer was mounted on a sapphire substrate and thinned down to about 30@xmath41 m for the transmission measurement .",
    "spin polarized electrons were optically excited by a circularly polarized pump pulse . in this setup ,",
    "the ultrafast laser pulses are generated by a mode - locked ti : sapphire laser oscillator operating at 76mhz repetition frequency .",
    "the samples were held at low temperatures in an optical cryostat with a split - coil superconducting magnet , and a magnetic field of typically 4 t was applied . after the excitation , the electron spins begin to precess in a magnetic field applied parallel to the sample surface ( voigt geometry ) . by measuring the polarization rotation of a linearly polarized probe beam of the same wavelength transmitted through the sample , the electron spin dynamics can be monitored directly .",
    "the spin precession results in an oscillating signal , as shown in fig .  1 , that decays exponentially .",
    "we use an exponential fit for the signal envelope to extract the decay time due to dephasing processes , which is conventionally denoted  @xcite by the ensemble spin dephasing time   @xmath42 .    for the comparison with the experiment , we use for the calculation initial carrier distributions @xmath43 , which contain both the influence of the doping and the optical excitation , because the excitation pulse duration is much shorter than the timescale of the subsequent electronic spin dynamics , so that any coherences introduced by the pulse can be ignored for the electronic dynamics .",
    "the itinerant carriers introduced by the doping are assumed to be completely relaxed , and are modeld by unpolarized fermi - dirac electron distributions @xmath44 at lattice temperature with electronic density equal to the density of dopants .",

    ", we include a magnetic field of 4 t , a lattice temperature 4k .",
    "further we choose a 50% initial spin polarization of the optically excited carriers , which corresponds to the optimal spin polarization achievable by optical orientation at the bandgap .",
    "@xcite for the calculation of the time - resolved fr signal shown in fig .  1 , we assume a linearly polarized probe pulse degenerate with the circularly polarized pump .",

    "for the experimental and theoretical `` raw data , '' as shown , for instance , in fig .  1 , we use the same exponential fit for the decay of the signal envelope to extract  @xmath42 .",
    "figure  2 shows the dependence of the spin - dephasing time @xmath54 on the photoexcited carrier density . both in theory and experiment we find monotonically decreasing dephasing times for n - doped gaas ( @xmath55@xmath56 ) and increasing dephasing times for undoped gaas with the better agreement for the undoped gaas . when comparing measured and calculated results ,",
    "it should be noted that there is a considerable uncertainty in the experiment because the photoexcited carrier density is difficult to estimate , and for the doped sample , we have an additional uncertainty in the doping density . taking this into account ,",
    "the agreement for the doped gaas is very good .",
    "the agreement for undoped gaas is even better because the weak dependence of the spin - dephasing time on the excited carrier density means that the experimental uncertainty in the optically excited carrier density has only a limited influence .",
    "the spin - dephasing times for undoped and n - doped gaas in fig .",
    "2 differ by more than a factor of three and have different slopes due to the different spin dynamics in both cases : in the undoped material , the spin of a nonequilibrium , highly spin - polarized ( 50% ) electron plasma relaxes , whereas in the doped material the spin dynamics of polarized optically excited electrons occurs in the presence of unpolarized electrons residing in the material due to the n - doping .",
    "for these two scenarios , the interplay of the different scattering mechanisms ( carrier - carrier , carrier - phonon , and carrier - impurity ) and screening , and thus the influence of the optically excited carrier density on the spin - dephasing time are different .",
    "k and with @xmath37 t external magnetic field .",
    "the doping density is @xmath57 ( calculation ) and @xmath58 ( experiment).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    figure  2 already shows the pronounced influence of the doping density on the spin - dephasing time , and we investigate it now in more detail .",
    "the theoretical and experimental results in fig .  3 are obtained by varying the doping density for a fixed density of optically excited carriers of @xmath59@xmath56 .",
    "we find good agreement of the measured data points with our microscopic calculation including only itinerant - electron dynamics , which suggests that the peak of the spin - dephasing time at intermediate doping densities can be explained without invoking a metal - insulator transition .",
    "@xcite a qualitative explanation of this peak is provided by the motional narrowing relation  @xcite @xmath60 in eq .",
    ", @xmath61 is the effective larmor frequency due to the dp spin splitting averaged over the electrons taking part in the spin - precession and dephasing dynamics .",
    "the spin and momentum relaxation times are denoted by @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively . for low and moderate doping densities , i.e. , for densities up to @xmath64@xmath56 we are in the motional narrowing regime because the larmor frequency @xmath65 of the precession of an electron is proportional to  @xmath66 .",
    "thus it becomes large only for electrons excited at larger momenta , which is the case at higher doping concentrations for optical excitation beyond the quasi fermi - level of the relaxed electrons .",
    "the combination of elastic impurity scattering and mainly inelastic coulomb scattering leads to a decrease of the effective momentum scattering time  @xmath63 with increasing doping density . via the motional narrowing relation",
    "this translates to a longer spin - dephasing time . for higher doping concentrations , the motional narrowing regime described by the inequality in eq .",
    "is left and the spin - dephasing time drops with increasing doping concentration .",
    "@xcite    for a more quantitative understanding of the doping density dependence in fig .  3",
    ", we analyze the contributions of the different scattering mechanisms . to this end",
    ", we also show in fig .",
    "3 the spin - dephasing time for the two artificial cases of ( i ) only elastic impurity scattering , and ( ii ) no impurity scattering . for case ( ii )",
    "we still include carrier - carrier and carrier - phonon scattering , which lead to elastic and inelastic scattering events , but the inelastic processes have the larger available phase space and therefore dominate case ( ii ) . for undoped gaas , i.e. , doping densities of less than @xmath67@xmath56 , the full calculation is identical to case ( ii ) , which shows that carrier - carrier and carrier - phonon scattering are responsible for the spin dephasing .",
    "@xmath56 because for low impurity concentrations there are hardly any impurity scattering events contributing to spin dephasing , so that the spin - dephasing time rapidly approaches a timescale of 10ns . ] for intermediate doping densities between @xmath67@xmath56 and @xmath64@xmath56 the rise of the spin - dephasing time towards a maximum at @xmath68@xmath56 is determined by the _ interplay _ of the elastic impurity scattering , the predominantly inelastic carrier - carrier / phonon scattering , and the influence of screening on all three scattering processes .",
    "inelastic or elastic scattering processes alone can not explain the behavior of the spin - dephasing time in this region : if only elastic scattering is included , as in case ( i ) , electrons are not scattered away from the higher @xmath69 states , in which they are excited by the laser ; there they experience a faster precession , cf .",
    "eq .  , and thus dephase more quickly with increasing doping concentration .",
    "this effect counteracts the increasing effectiveness of the carrier - impurity scattering , which , in the picture of eq .  , leads to a shorter @xmath63 .",
    "if only carrier - carrier and carrier - phonon scattering is included , as in case ( ii ) , the optically excited carrier density of @xmath59@xmath56 dominates over or is comparable to the doped carrier density for doping concentration of up to several @xmath70@xmath56 , so that no pronounced density dependence is to be expected for these scattering mechanisms alone .",
    "@xmath56 the influence of screening keeps the carrier - carrier and carrier - phonon scattering alone from becoming more important for the spin dephasing . ] for high doping concentrations beyond @xmath64@xmath56 , the optically excited carriers can not be scattered out of the high @xmath69 states in which they are created , because of the high density of relaxed electrons .",
    "then , by  eq .",
    ", the precession of the excited electrons becomes too fast for the timescales of elastic [ case(i ) ] scattering , inelastic scattering [ case(ii ) ] or their combination [ full result ] , so that the spin - dephasing time experiences a pronounced drop .",
    "@xcite the complex behavior of the doping - density dependence of the spin - dephasing time is thus quantitatively explained by the interplay of the different elastic and inelastic scattering mechanisms , and the influence of screening .",
    "this picture is essentially supported by a reanalysis of the data of fig .  3 in ref .  .",
    "last , but not least , we wish to stress that the numerical results provide a microscopic picture of motional narrowing in spin dephasing , i.e. , an increasing @xmath42 with decreasing momentum scattering time , and the breakdown of this behavior for fast electronic precession . we do not need to resort to established analytical results for dp spin dephasing ,  @xcite which do not work over the whole density regime and for pronounced non - equilibrium conditions .",
