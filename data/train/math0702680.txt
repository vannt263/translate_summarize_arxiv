    "diameter is one of the most basic geometric invariants . knowing its lower bound not only provides information about the orbit space @xmath7 , but also leads to other interesting results . and , while representations of compact lie groups are well understood , the geometry of the corresponding spherical quotients is virtually unknown and is potentially very important .",
    "let @xmath8 , where @xmath5 is a closed , nontransitive subgroup of @xmath9 , and examine the diameter of @xmath10 .",
    "when g is finite , @xmath11 and @xmath12 is a manifold , there exits an explicit lower bound on the diameter that depends only on the dimension @xmath13 , and a global lower bound that is independent of dimension also exists @xcite .",
    "( throughout this paper , unless otherwise explicitly stated , @xmath14 is taken to be the round unit sphere of dimension @xmath13 . ) for other closed , nontransitive groups , a lower bound on the diameter also exists @xcite , but it is not always given explicitly .",
    "this paper examines the diameter of quotients of the three - dimensional sphere to find an optimal lower bound .",
    "we also find descriptions of many of these orbit spaces and learn about their geometry",
    ".    often , given a specific compact lie group , @xmath5 , acting isometrically and ( almost ) effectively on @xmath15 , with @xmath16 , we can recover the manifold from the possible orbit space decompositions of the action .",
    "for example , a classic theorem of hsiang and kleiner @xcite states :    [ t : hsiangkleiner ] let @xmath17 be a 1-connected , strictly positively curved closed riemannian manifold which admits an effective , isometric @xmath18 action",
    ". then @xmath17 is homeomorphic to @xmath19 or @xmath20 .    here",
    ", the essential point of the proof lies in understanding the fixed point set of the circle action . by work of freedman @xcite",
    ", one can recover the manifold merely by knowing the euler characteristic , @xmath21 , which in this case turns out to be equal to @xmath22 .",
    "in particular , in the case where @xmath23 consists of isolated points , these points are singular orbits of the action , and we can bound the total number of such orbits via the diameter of the orbit space of the normal sphere to any such point of isotropy . here",
    "the normal sphere is an @xmath1 and the upper bound on the diameter of @xmath24 tells us that there are no more than 3 such points .",
    "we note as well , that a theorem of rong @xcite uses the same technique to show that a 1-connected , strictly positively curved , closed riemannian 5-manifold admitting a @xmath25 isometric and effective action is homeomorphic to @xmath26 .",
    "in particular , this is part of a more general phenomenon where a bound on the _ q - extent _ of a space allows us to limit the number of singular points of a given action , and we have ( @xcite , @xcite ) :    let @xmath15 be a closed manifold with @xmath16 on which @xmath5 acts ( almost ) effectively by isometries .",
    "suppose @xmath27 are points such that @xmath28 , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the space of directions at @xmath31 in @xmath32 .",
    "then @xmath15 can be exhibited as @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 are tubular neighborhoods of the @xmath36-orbits and @xmath37 .",
    "in particular , @xmath15 is homeomorphic to the sphere if @xmath38 , i.e. , if @xmath36 , @xmath35 are isolated fixed points of @xmath5 and @xmath28 .",
    "thus , local diameter information gives global results about the structure of the manifold .",
    "when @xmath5 is finite in @xmath39 , then @xmath4 is a good orbifold , that is , the global quotient of a riemannian manifold by a discrete subgroup of its isometry group @xcite .",
    "finite subgroups of @xmath40 are classified in @xcite and various methods from mcgowan @xcite and dunbar @xcite are used to find a lower bound on the diameter of the resulting spherical quotients .",
    "when @xmath5 is infinite , @xmath4 is a spherical alexandrov space with curvature bounded below .",
    "this is a length space with riemannian notions such as distance and curvature obtained by comparison with @xmath14 via toponogov @xcite .",
    "possible groups in @xmath41 are classified in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "extensions of these groups in @xmath40 are examined along with the diameters of the resulting spherical quotients .    if @xmath5 is a closed , non - transitive subgroup in @xmath40 then @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",
    "this diameter is approximately @xmath44 and is achieved by @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the binary icosahedral group , and @xmath47 is defined by first noting that the unit quaternions may be identified with @xmath1 by @xmath48 , where @xmath49 . with this identification , @xmath50 maps @xmath51",
    "to @xmath52 , if for every @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "the map @xmath50 is a surjective homomorphism with kernel @xmath55 .",
    "if @xmath5 is finite then @xmath56 , in the limit as @xmath57 , achieves the smallest diameter , where @xmath58 is the binary cyclic group .",
    "the orbit space is a manifold only if @xmath59 @xcite and otherwise it is a seifert - fibered orbifold , foliated by circles and intervals . among nonfibering orbifolds",
    ", @xmath60 achieves the smallest diameter , where @xmath61 is the binary octahedral group . a lower bound estimate for this diameter is @xmath62 , which is approximately @xmath63 .",
    "note that the _ cohomogeneity _ of a connected @xmath5-action is the codimension of its principal orbit , or equivalently , the dimension of the orbit space .",
    "we extend this definition to include non - trivial disconnected actions .",
    "with respect to cohomogeneity one actions , we not only examine those actions on @xmath1 , but also on a round sphere of any dimension , and we find that the smallest diameter for a non - trivial disconnected cohomogeneity one action on any @xmath14 is @xmath64 .",
    "we show that only certain actions of cohomogeneity one admit a finite extension of the group that halves the diameter of the corresponding orbit space .    using this result and results from @xcite and @xcite we are able to prove the following :",
    "let @xmath5 act by cohomogeneity 1 , 2 , or 3 on @xmath14 .",
    "further , suppose that if @xmath5 is connected , the action is a classical connected polar action . then ( ( s^n / g))=\\ {    ll & + & + &    .    here",
    "we define a _ classical polar _ action to be one which corresponds to a symmetric space @xmath65 where both @xmath5 and @xmath66 are classical lie groups .",
    "recall that all polar actions on spheres correspond to the isotropy subgroup of a symmetric space @xcite , i.e. , they correspond to the natural action of the isotropy subgroup @xmath66 of @xmath65 acting on @xmath67 .",
    "this theorem and other work ( @xcite , @xcite ) lead us to the following conjecture :    let @xmath5 act irreducibly on @xmath14 by cohomogeneity @xmath68 , where @xmath69 .",
    "then for all @xmath70 and for all sufficiently large @xmath68 ( and all @xmath71 ) , @xmath72 is within @xmath73 of @xmath74 .",
    "we break the remainder of the paper into three sections , which each consider the action of @xmath5 on @xmath1 of a specific cohomogeneity , plus a section giving our conclusions .",
    "let @xmath5 be an action on @xmath1 whose orbit space is dimension 1 , then the minimal diameter of @xmath2 is @xmath75 .",
    "the classification of low cohomogeneity actions on spheres ( @xcite , @xcite ) tells us that the only two possible connected groups which can act effectively on @xmath1 by cohomogeneity one are @xmath76 and @xmath25 .",
    "the action by @xmath76 has principal orbit @xmath77 , and singular orbits equal to points ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "its orbit space is an interval of length @xmath79 .",
    "the second action is @xmath25 acting with principal orbit @xmath25 and singular orbits @xmath80",
    "( each singular orbit is a different @xmath80 ) .",
    "its orbit space is an interval of length @xmath74 .",
    "note that conjugation is a group isomorphism and that given any @xmath83 , @xmath84 is isomorphic to @xmath66 , the connected component of the identity of @xmath81 .",
    "further , since @xmath84 is also a subgroup of @xmath81 , @xmath85 , and @xmath82 .    we may write the action of @xmath76 acting by cohomogeneity one on @xmath1 , as follows .",
    "let @xmath1 be the standard sphere in @xmath86 ; we represent its points as @xmath87 and the action is represented by the matrix @xmath88 where @xmath89 .",
    "it is clear that the points @xmath90 and @xmath91 are fixed by this action .",
    "as well , it is clear that the matrix @xmath92 is an element of @xmath40 , and that @xmath93 commutes with @xmath52 and acts on @xmath1 by interchanging the @xmath94 coordinate of any point with its negative .",
    "one easily sees that this action sends any given orbit with a specified @xmath94 coordinate to the corresponding orbit with @xmath95 coordinate .",
    "this action `` folds '' the orbit space of @xmath96 ( an interval of length @xmath79 ) in half to obtain an interval of length @xmath74 .",
    "moreover , the normalizer of @xmath76 in @xmath40 is exactly the group generated by @xmath76 and @xmath93 .",
    "now @xmath25 is the maximal torus in @xmath40 and we will denote it by @xmath97 the weyl group of @xmath41 is isomorphic to @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the cyclic group of order @xmath13 , and the order 2 element @xmath100 identifies the two singular orbits @xmath101 to each other , and acts upon the principal orbit @xmath25 at distance @xmath75 from the singular orbits , identifying the remaining principal orbits in pairs according to their respective distances from the singular orbits .",
    "thus , the diameter of the resulting orbit space is @xmath75 .",
    "[ t : cuthalf ] suppose @xmath5 acts isometrically and ( almost ) effectively on @xmath102 by cohomogeneity one , where @xmath102 is a closed riemannian manifold of strictly positive sectional curvature .",
    "then any finite extension of @xmath5 in @xmath103 can reduce the diameter of @xmath104 by at most one - half .",
    "topologically , there are 4 possibilities for the orbit space of a manifold by a cohomogeneity one action .",
    "they are @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath18 , and an interval ( cf .",
    "however , the additional restriction of strictly positive sectional curvature eliminates the first three possibilities , since such a manifold will be compact and have finite fundamental group . over the interval , the manifold decomposes into principal orbits over its interior and 2 singular orbits over each endpoint , and the diameter of the orbit space is given by the length of the interval .",
    "now , any finite isometric action on such an interval can only `` fold '' the interval in half , identifying the endpoints to each other and corresponding pairs of principal orbits at a given distance from one of the corresponding pairs of endpoints .",
    "the principal orbit equidistant from both endpoints is not identified to any other , and itself is acted on nontrivially . clearly such an action halves the diameter .",
    "note that any other action would be discontinuous or not isometric . since any finite group of order greater than 2 will have a cyclic element of order greater than or equal to 3 , or a subgroup isomorphic to @xmath107 it suffices to understand these two cases .    in the case where we have a subgroup of order 3",
    "acting effectively , the action would identify three distinct points in the interval .",
    "however , it would fail to be isometric ( suppose @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 , then we must have @xmath114 in order for it to be an isometry , but this is clearly impossible in any interval ) .",
    "the argument is similar if we have a cyclic group of order greater than three .",
    "for the case where we have an effective action by a subgroup isomorphic to @xmath98 , if the action decreases the diameter , then it must fold the interval in half two times .",
    "for the action to be isometric , this means that the corresponding singular orbits of the original interval and of the once - folded interval must respectively be isometric themselves .",
    "we observe however that even if this is true at first , it can not hold for the once - folded interval , since one singular orbit of this interval will be one of the original singular orbits , and the other the result of a @xmath115 action on a principal orbit . a quick inspection of table [ ta : cohomone ] of cohomogeneity one actions on spheres shows that in all cases , the principal orbit is of strictly larger dimension than its singular orbits and thus it is impossible to make any further identifications , that is , an effective action by a finite subgroup isomorphic to @xmath98 is not allowed .      we will show that the cohomogeneity one actions of diameter @xmath79 and @xmath74 both admit finite extensions which fold the corresponding interval in half . as well , there are two actions of diameter @xmath116 ( of the total four ) which also admit finite extensions .",
    "the @xmath79 and @xmath74 diameter actions are exactly the reducible actions",
    ". the remaining irreducible actions , other than the two of diameter @xmath116 we mentioned previously , do not admit finite extensions .",
    "we note that all the orbit spaces of diameter @xmath75 have non - isometric singular orbits and thus there is no isometric action which can reduce their respective diameters ( see proof of lemma [ t : cuthalf ] ) .",
    "thus we need only show that the remaining @xmath116 and the @xmath64 actions do not admit finite extensions which halve the diameters of their orbit spaces .",
    "all the normal subgroups in these tables have index 2 . for the remaining subgroups",
    "we note that the inclusions of # @xmath117 in # @xmath118 and # @xmath119 in # @xmath120 are both index 3 , while the inclusions of # @xmath121 in # @xmath117 and # @xmath122 in # @xmath119 are both index 4 , the inclusion of # @xmath118 in # @xmath123 is index 5 , and the inclusions of # @xmath124 and a conjugate in @xmath125 of # @xmath126 in # @xmath127 are both index 60 .",
    "note that @xmath130 is strictly smaller than @xmath131 .",
    "we further note that there seems to be no relationship whatsoever between the index of an extension and any subsequent change in diameter .",
    "in particular , there are many extensions of index 2 where the diameter remains unchanged , others where the diameter is reduced by half , others where the diameter is reduced instead by @xmath132 and still others by @xmath133 .",
    "we observe that the nonfibering groups giving `` nice '' diameters , i.e. , rational multiples of @xmath79 , are mainly of one type .",
    "the majority are of the form @xmath134 where @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "there are two exceptions , groups # @xmath118 and # @xmath120 , which are of the form @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "the former groups with @xmath139 are `` diagonal '' groups ; that is , they project to diagonal subgroups of @xmath140 .",
    "these groups are characterized by having very small orbits of the quaternion @xmath141 and hence very large pre - fundamental domains . if the group contains the nontrivial central element then the orbit of @xmath141 is @xmath142 , and if not , its orbit is simply @xmath141 .",
    "thus these groups will have pre - fundamental domain the entire 3-sphere or the half sphere and corresponding diameters of @xmath79 and @xmath143 . the bigger @xmath144 and",
    "@xmath145 become the larger the orbit of @xmath141 becomes ( for fixed @xmath146 , @xmath147 ) .",
    "these will be points at rational multiples of @xmath79 away from @xmath141 , generating faces of the pre - fundamental domain ( halfway between each point and @xmath141 ) . however , there is no easy way to predict in general whether or not these faces will happen to intersect at a point which is at a distance from @xmath141 which is a rational multiplle of @xmath79 .",
    "the remaining nonfibering groups giving diameters that are irrational multiples of @xmath79 are generally of the form @xmath134 , where @xmath148 and @xmath149 or of the form ( @xmath150 or an extension of the same .    note that @xmath151 and @xmath152 , but @xmath137 and @xmath138 both have diameters that are rational multiples of @xmath79 and @xmath153 , while @xmath154 both have diameters that are irrational multiples of @xmath79 .",
    "thus a general theorem relating these finite groups with diameters that are rational or irrational multiples of @xmath79 seems elusive .",
    "we are interested in finding a global lower bound for isometric group actions on spheres .",
    "we note that the lower bound for any polar action arising from a symmetric space @xmath65 where either @xmath5 or @xmath66 ( or both ) is a product of classical lie groups only , which we will define as a _ classical polar _ action , approaches @xmath74 as the cohomogeneity of the action increases ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) ) .",
    "those polar actions arising from symmetric spaces for which @xmath5 or @xmath66 ( or both ) is a product of classical lie groups and exceptional lie groups are to be called _ exceptional polar _ actions .",
    "the result holds for many of these groups as well , but for many of the groups in this list , the orbit space is yet to be calculated ( given that these admit no `` easy '' matrix representation , other methods must be used ) .",
    "we note as well , that in the spherical cohomogeneity 2 case , the possible orbit spaces are @xmath155 , @xmath156 ( with 0 , 1 , 2 or 3 exceptional singular points corresponding to an isolated singular orbit ) . for the disk cases ,",
    "those with exceptional singular orbits are limited by the corresponding isolated singular orbits as to further possible identifications , just as in the case of the interval for cohomogeneity 1 ) .",
    "in particular , there are very few cases where the diameter will actually be changed after an identification and in none of these cases does the overall minimum diameter change . for the disk with no exceptional singular points , the same holds true . given the work done here and work from @xcite and @xcite on classical connected polar actions of cohomogeneity 3 , we can prove the following theorem :    [ t : mindiamalln ] let @xmath5 act irreducibly by cohomogeneity 1 , 2 , or 3 on @xmath14 .",
    "further suppose that the action is classical connected polar or non - trivial disconnected for the cohomogeneity 3 cases when @xmath157 .",
    "then @xmath158 where @xmath159      [ t : limitconj ] let @xmath5 act irreducibly on @xmath14 by cohomogeneity @xmath68 , where @xmath69 .",
    "then for all @xmath70 and for all sufficiently large @xmath68 ( and all @xmath71 ) , @xmath72 is within @xmath73 of @xmath74 .",
    "we base this conjecture on the following : in @xcite and @xcite , we can show that no further finite identifications can be made on the orbit spaces in cohomogeneity 3 .",
    "thus , there are no finite extensions of the classical connected polar actions which will decrease diameter . furthermore , for a cohomogeneity @xmath68 action on @xmath14 , where @xmath160 and additionally @xmath161 when @xmath162 respectively , @xmath163 does not appear as a quotient space , in contrast to the @xmath155 which results from a cohomogeneity 2 circle action on @xmath1 .",
    "thus we can reasonably expect diameters to be strictly larger than those found in cohomogeneities 2 and 3 , for sufficiently large @xmath68 .",
    "we exclude the odd - dimensional spheres , because they all admit cohomogeneity @xmath164 free circle actions with quotient spaces a complex projective space of diameter @xmath143 and hence are likely to have quotients by finite extensions with diameters approaching @xmath165 .",
    "when considering cohomogeneity @xmath13 actions on @xmath14 , @xmath166 , one might expect these diameters to increase toward @xmath143 as well , at least for @xmath13 even , since for @xmath13 uneven , we will have once again , as in section [ s : fibso ] , finite actions converging to a free circle action at least halving the diameter of the corresponding spherical quotient space . to illustrate this tendency towards @xmath74 ,",
    "consider the orbifold @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the full group of symmetries of the cubic tessellation of @xmath14 ( i.e. , the radial projection of a hypercube in @xmath167 onto @xmath14 ) .",
    "its diameter is @xmath168 , which converges to @xmath74 as @xmath13 goes to infinity .",
