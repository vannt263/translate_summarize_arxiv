    "the conventional picture of luminous early type cluster galaxies ( e and s0 ) is that their stars formed in a short period of time nearly a hubble time ago ( tinsley & gunn 1976 ) . since the suggestion of sandage & visvinathan ( 1978 ) that the uv - optical color - magnitude relation for cluster early type galaxies could be used to constrain their star formation histories , studies of the cluster color - magnitude relations have almost universally confirmed the conventional picture ( bower , lucey , & ellis 1992 , ble ; ellis et al .",
    "1997 ) ; the luminous , early type populations of rich clusters are remarkably homogeneous and the bulk of their stellar populations appear to be old .",
    "dressler et al .",
    "( 1997 , d97 ) , on the other hand , suggest that the luminous s0 galaxies are less abundant in distant clusters relative to the fractions of these types seen in present day clusters .",
    "they suggest that there must have been strong evolution in the s0 population across the redshift range @xmath30.5 to account for the large s0 populations seen in local clusters .",
    "if s0 galaxies are being produced in clusters in recent times then they should appear characteristically younger than the elliptical population .",
    "indeed , kuntschner & davies ( 1998 ) , find such an effect with the majority of the s0 galaxies in a sample drawn from the fornax cluster having luminosity - weighted ages several gyrs younger than the ellipticals .",
    "moreover , the post - starburst galaxies ( psg ) found in large numbers in the distant clusters ( e.g.  couch & sharples 1987 , cs87 ; dressler et al .  1999 ,",
    "d99 ) would provide an obvious intermediate phase in the transformation of star forming disk galaxies into passive s0 s ( poggianti et al .  1999 ,",
    "however , this model then leads to a potential conflict with those results confirming the conventional model of old , coeval e and s0 galaxies .    in this letter",
    ", we apply the spectroscopic technique of kuntschner & davies ( 1998 ) in clusters out to @xmath4 to place new constraints on the evolution of the s0 population in rich clusters by a direct comparison of the relative ages of the cluster s0 and e populations at three epochs spanning the range where strong evolution is claimed in the proportion of s0 galaxies within rich clusters ( d97 ) . in  2 , we discuss the morphological and spectroscopic data as well as describing the method we used to separate age and metallicity effects in the spectra , then in  3 , we present the derived constraints on s0 evolution , and finally in  4 , we suggest a resolution to the apparent conflict .",
    "our analysis makes use of existing moderate resolution spectroscopy and _ hst _ morphologies for galaxies in three clusters at @xmath0 and a further 9 clusters between @xmath10.55 .",
    "existing spectroscopic and morphological data for coma are included as a local ( @xmath50.0 ) , rich cluster comparison .",
    "in particular we highlight the usefulness of three clusters at @xmath0 from our sample in this analysis  for the evolution claimed by d97 , almost half the s0 population of these clusters should have been produced in the 1.5gyrs since @xmath6 . this relatively high fraction coupled with the reasonable numbers of s0 galaxies in these systems",
    "provides a strong test of the d97 scenario .      for coma ,",
    "the morphologies are taken from godwin , metcalfe , & peach ( 1983 ) .",
    "there are 63 elliptical and 121 s0 cluster members for which we also have high quality spectra .",
    "for the three clusters at @xmath0 ( ac103 , ac114 , and ac118 ) , we have used the morphological classifications from couch et al .",
    "( 1998 , c98 ) and the details of the observations are contained therein .",
    "the f702w imaging consists of 3-orbit exposures of the cores of ac118 and ac103 , and a mosaic of four , 6 orbit exposures on ac114 .",
    "the morphologies from couch et al .",
    "( 1998 ) are robust down to @xmath7 yielding classifications for 25 spectroscopically - confirmed cluster ellipticals and 29 s0 cluster members .",
    "our more distant cluster sample comes from observations by the morphs collaboration , consisting of deep _ hst _ imaging in the f702w , f814w , or f555w filters of 11 fields in 10 clusters in the redshift range @xmath8 .",
    "details of these observations can be found in smail et al .",
    "the spectroscopic follow - up of this survey provides membership for 15 elliptical and 10 s0 galaxies brighter than @xmath9=23.5 or @xmath10=23.0 ( d99 ) .",
    "smail et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and d97 have shown that the incidence of round and/or face - on s0 galaxies likely to be misclassified as ellipticals in the distant clusters is no worse than that seen in local samples ( 15% ) .",
    "the coma cluster data have been published by caldwell et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and caldwell & rose ( 1997 , cr97 ) , and the reduced galaxy spectra were kindly provided by the authors .",
    "the spectral resolution of their spectra is @xmath11  fwhm with s / n ranging from 30 to 100  substantially above that achieved for individual galaxies in the distant samples .",
    "spectroscopic observations for the three clusters at @xmath0 are taken from two sources , cs87 and c98 .",
    "the cs87 spectra were collected at the 3.9-m anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) with the focap multi - fiber system and the ipcs detector , and have a spectral resolution of @xmath12  fwhm .",
    "the c98 spectra were also collected at the aat with ldss-1 , a multi - slit spectrograph , and have a spectral resolution of @xmath13   fwhm .",
    "the spectra in both samples range in signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) from 3 to 10 , with the median being @xmath148 .",
    "the spectroscopic observations of galaxies in the morphs sample is presented in d99 and these spectra were kindly provided by the authors .",
    "the majority of these spectra come from the cosmic multi - object spectrograph on the 5.1-m hale telescope .",
    "the spectral resolution of these observations is 8  fwhm and the median s / n is 25 for the spectra analysed here ( the lowest having s / n=5 ) .",
    "the majority of the spectra provide rest - frame wavelength coverage which includes 3900@xmath155300 , i.e.  from the caii h & k lines through to the mg triplet .",
    "all of the galaxy spectra have been smoothed to the 9   resolution of the ldss-1 data .",
    "the main obstacle to an analysis of ages and metallicities of galaxies is the degeneracy of those two effects on the galaxy spectral energy distribution . focusing on individual spectral features",
    "has allowed marked progress in breaking that degeneracy ( c.f .",
    "worthey 1994 , w94 ; worthey & ottaviani 1997 ; jones & worthey 1995 ) , and for this paper we have chosen seven of the commonly used lick spectral indices .",
    "the h@xmath16 index acts as an age indicator ( worthey & ottaviani 1997 ) , while the ca4227 , fe4383 , ca4455 , fe4531 , c@xmath174668 , and fe5015 indices trace metallicity effects ( w94 ) .",
    "this analysis relies upon high quality spectra to robustly separate the effects of age and metallicity , and given that we are looking for evidence of evolution in the characteristics of the overall population of s0 galaxies _ relative _ to ellipticals , we have chosen to co - add the s0 and elliptical spectra at each redshift and perform a _",
    "( e versus s0 ) analysis in each case ( z=0.0 , 0.31 , @xmath140.50 ) .",
    "co - addition of the spectra was achieved using the scombine routine in iraf after having first transformed them onto the rest wavelength scale .",
    "this provided final spectra with s / n@xmath18 and 43 for the e and s0 s in the @xmath0 clusters , and s / n@xmath19 and 79 for the same respective types in the @xmath4 clusters .",
    "seven indices were measured in the co - added spectra , with those pertaining to the same element being combined to form average values .",
    "figure 1 shall be used to present our results .",
    "the grid lines represent lines of constant age ( dotted lines ) and constant metallicity ( solid lines ) as taken from the single stellar population models of w94 ; they are labelled in panel c to indicate age differences in gyr and metallicity differences in dex units of [ fe / h ] .",
    "each redshift is represented by a different shaped symbol with open and filled versions being used to differentiate between the e and s0 measurements , respectively .",
    "regarding the separation of age and metallicity , we see that while the age and metallicity lines are not orthogonal , they do indeed provide discrimination between these two effects .",
    "note that any galaxy ` ages ' discussed in this letter will be luminosity - weighted mean ages , and are not meant to indicate the ages of the oldest stars in the galaxies .",
    "also , because the three different samples of spectra have been collected with different telescope ",
    "detector combinations , and because we have not attempted to reconcile any offsets between spectral index measurements of the different systems and the models , we stress that there are zero point offsets relative to the age  metallicity model grid associated with each redshift .",
    "accordingly , we can not simply compare ` ages ' between redshifts ; only the relative ages are meaningful at a given redshift",
    ". this limitation does not bear on our analysis since we are concerned only with a differential comparison between the e and s0 populations at a single redshift .",
    "the following sections address the results derived from fig .  1 , and their implications .",
    "panels a  c of fig .  1 show the h@xmath16 index plotted against the mean of the three fe indices , the mean of the two ca indices , and the c@xmath20 index , respectively . the c@xmath20 has been proposed as a possible metallicity indicator and below we discuss its usefulness in the context of our results .",
    "the error bars for h@xmath16 are approximately the size of the points for the two higher redshift samples and one fifth the size of the points for coma , so the separation between points in h@xmath16 is less than 1@xmath21 for the e and s0 spectra at a given redshift .",
    "furthermore , in panels  a & b , no pair of points is separated by more than 1@xmath21 in the metallicity index .",
    "in contrast , we see for the c@xmath20 index good agreement between the e and s0 populations in coma , some consistency between the populations in the morphs sample ( less than 2@xmath21 difference ) , but a 7@xmath21 difference between the apparent metallicities of the e and s0 population in the @xmath0 clusters from cs87/c98 .",
    "we note that the cs87/c98 elliptical and s0 spectra were obtained in the same observing runs and reduced without differentiating between the morphological types , so it is difficult to imagine that a systematic error in the reduction could be responsible for this disagreement .",
    "the near orthogonality of the age and metallicity sequences with the index axes means that the difference in the c@xmath20 index for elliptical and s0 galaxies in the cs87/c98 sample translates into an age difference of around 12 gyrs .",
    "the discrepent results from the c@xmath20 index compared to the broad agreement between our other two age / metallicity indicators requires an explanation .",
    "the c@xmath20 index is extremely sensitive to changes in the photospheric carbon abundance in stars ( tripicco & bell 1995 ) and the most striking change in the carbon abundance of a star is in the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase of evolution where stars reach the thermally pulsing agb and become carbon stars ( iben 1993 ) .",
    "the brightest _ and _ coolest of these stars have high initial masses and will be extinct by about 1 gyr after a burst of star formation suggesting that a recent burst is indeed the cause of the difference between the e and s0 c@xmath20 indices .",
    "however , while the integrated number of carbon stars produced over the first 1 gyr after a burst is enough to produce the observed change in the c@xmath20 index , the number of such stars present _ at any one time _",
    "is too small ( buzzoni 1989 ) .",
    "moreover , the similarity between the e and s0 galaxies at other redshifts ( unless the three cs87/c98 clusters are conspiratorily pathological ) , suggests that we can not appeal to global differences in carbon abundances due to environment .",
    "the lack of a simple explanation of the discrepent c@xmath20 indices leads us to concentrate on our other age / metallicity indicators and we suggest that the c@xmath20 index , despite its empirical connection with metallicity demonstrated by w94 , requires more study before it can be reliably used to investigate the age / metallicity of integrated stellar populations .    in summary , with the exception of the cs87/c98 c@xmath20 index in the @xmath0 clusters , we find that the luminosity weighted average age of elliptical and s0 galaxies in rich clusters derived from this data are indistinguishable out to @xmath22 .      the distribution of h@xmath16 values for e and s0 galaxies in the different clusters can also be used to place limits on recent star formation in the galaxies , and hence we have measured this spectral index in the individual galaxy spectra as well . comparing the e and s0 h@xmath16 distributions for the three different cluster samples , we find using the ks test that they are indistinguishable with the formal probabilities that they are drawn from different populations being : p(ks)@xmath23=53% , p(ks)@xmath24=34% , and p(ks)@xmath25=0% .",
    "the d97 results suggest that the number of s0 galaxies in the more distant morphs clusters would have to increase four - fold to reproduce the e : s0 ratio in local clusters , while 50% of the s0 s in the @xmath0 samples would need to have formed since @xmath22 .",
    "we can directly evaluate the sensitivity of our analysis to this form of evolution by selecting a random sample of 50% of the @xmath0 s0 s and adding a contribution from a model spectrum of a young stellar population from the library of bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) to each s0 spectrum and then recomputing the spectral indices .",
    "we have done this with two solar metallicity models , taken 0.5 and 1.0gyrs after the end of a burst of star formation .",
    "we then use the new indices to recalculate the h@xmath16 distribution of the entire s0 sample , and compare the new s0+model h@xmath16 distribution to the original e h@xmath16 distribution .",
    "this allows us to determine the minimum contribution from a young population in the s0 sample which our analysis of the @xmath0 clusters would detect ( assuming the broad framework of the evolution claimed by d97 ) .",
    "the resulting constraints , for the two different models , are that the h@xmath16 distribution for the s0+model galaxies is statistically distinguishable from the ellipticals at @xmath26% ( 92% ) significance level when 10% ( 10% ) of the @xmath27-band light in half of the s0 sample is contributed by a stars from a 0.5 ( 1.0)gyr old post - starburst stellar population .",
    "index of @xmath140.5 , which , given that only 50% of the s0 population has the young star light added , means the average index change we are sensitive to in the post - starburst s0 galaxies is @xmath141.0 . ]    converting this constraint to the mass fraction of a galaxy converted to stars in the burst , we conclude that the s0 galaxies at @xmath0 have not experienced bursts of more than 6% ( 11% ) by mass in the 0.5gyr ( 1gyr ) prior to the time of observation ( bruzual & charlot 1993 ) .",
    "these modest burst strengths are consistent with the strength of the star bursts found by barger et al .",
    "( 1996 ) in these same clusters .",
    "the equivalent star formation rates are typical of those seen in normal spiral galaxies .",
    "we conclude that for our analysis to detect a change in the characteristic age of s0 galaxies relative to ellipticals at the same redshift , at least half of the s0 s in these clusters would have to have undergone particularly intense bursts of star formation ( @xmath2% of their current stellar mass ) in the 1gyr prior to observation , i.e.  between @xmath28 and @xmath4 .",
    "_ this limit suggests that the bulk of the cluster s0 population is not being built up through a process of intense starbursts where spirals are converting their entire gas reservoir into stars in a single event . _",
    "by combining high resolution _ hst _ imagery and existing spectroscopy , we have been able to investigate the evolution of early type galaxies in moderate redshift clusters . we have used the stellar population models of worthey ( 1994 ) to disentangle the effects of age and metallicity in our spectra .",
    "we have two main conclusions : firstly , we find no evidence for an age difference between e and s0 galaxies in rich clusters out to @xmath50.5 . secondly , the precision with which our spectral index method rules out an age difference would imply that any recent star formation in the cluster s0 s at @xmath0 could have involved no more than 50% of these galaxies undergoing bursts in which no more than @xmath29% of their mass was converted into stars .",
    "poggianti et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have analysed the spectroscopic and morphological catalogs gathered for the @xmath10.57 clusters by d99 .",
    "they find evidence for a wide - spread suppression of star formation in cluster members , leading to large populations of psg and passive spirals which are much more prevelant in the cluster environment .",
    "the progenitors of these galaxies are identified with dusty , star burst galaxies infalling from the surrounding field .",
    "they suggest that the resulting passive , disk population are the progenitors of the s0 galaxies . at lower redshifts , caldwell et al .",
    "( 1996 , c96 ) have shown that in the coma cluster , balmer line strengths of psg early type galaxies can not be explained by a previously constant star formation rate , typical of spiral galaxies , which has been recently truncated , but that they require truncation to occur after a brief burst of @xmath1410% by mass , and well within the above limits placed on starbursts at higher redshifts . in cr97",
    "they conclude that these final , modest bursts of star formation in coma , as well as other nearby rich clusters , are indeed associated with the cluster environment .",
    "also , in both c96 and cr97 , they show that most of the starburst and post - starburst galaxies in their clusters are , morphologically , early type disk galaxies , either early type spirals or s0 s .    in light of the evidence from d97 that the s0 population in rich clusters needs to strongly increase between @xmath4 and today , the results of p99 , c96 and cr97 , together with the results of this letter , suggest a mostly unspectacular origin for the missing s0 galaxies .",
    "we conclude from the assembled evidence that the missing s0 galaxies are the remnants of old , early- type spiral galaxies which , as a result of their interaction with the rich cluster environment , have had their star formation truncated after possibly undergoing a final , modest burst of star formation .",
    "this conclusion suggests that with more sensitive age indicators and spectra of higher signal - to - noise and higher spectral resolution , we would be able to detect the effects of those bursts and test this hypothesis .",
    "such observations are possible from current 4- and 8-meter class telescopes .",
