    "the tsr - sr transition is characterized by the bulk gap closing and re - opening between the lowest two bands at @xmath19 as @xmath36 increases . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : band]a , in the i phase , an insulating gap is already opened by the zeeman field @xmath10 for the fermi gas at half filling .",
    "as @xmath36 increases , the system becomes superradiant , and the cavity - assisted raman field will couple different bands , leading to the deformation of the band structure .",
    "since the raman field only couples different spin - components , at @xmath19 , we have numerically checked that state @xmath84 is coupled to state @xmath196 , and state @xmath194 is coupled to state @xmath195 ( see the illustrations in fig .",
    "[ fig : band]a ) .",
    "these interband couplings will push the bands involved toward opposite directions . as a result ,",
    "states 1 and 2 will be shifted downward while states 3 and 4 will move upward . meanwhile , since the smaller gap between states 2 and 3 leads to a stronger interband coupling and consequently a wider energy splitting , the downward shift of state @xmath194 is faster than that of state @xmath84 , as @xmath36 and the interband coupling strength increase .",
    "these give rise to the bulk gap closing at the tsr - sr phase boundary ( see fig .  [",

    "therefore , the bulk gap in the tsr state will increase with increasing @xmath36 ( and the interband coupling strength ) .",

    "[ fig : band]b ) , the fermi surface at half - filling is reduced to a point .",
    "hence , a spin - up fermion with @xmath19 can be scattered by a cavity photon into a spin - down state at @xmath93 with the same energy .",
    "this nesting condition at the gap closing point leads to a peak in the derivative of the cavity photon number at the topological phase boundary , which can be used as a signal for the detection of the bulk gap closing and the corresponding topological phase boundary .",
    "we note that for @xmath2 , the nesting condition is satisfied only at this tsr - sr topological phase boundary ; while for @xmath1 , the nesting condition is satisfied along the sr phase boundary .       and with @xmath197 atoms on @xmath43 lattice sites .",

    "now we will analyze the robustness of these signals at higher temperatures and away from half filling .",
    "as an example , we adopt the typical parameters of @xmath203li atoms , where the states @xmath11 and @xmath204 respectively correspond to the states @xmath205 and @xmath206 in the ground hyperfine manifold . the recoil energy @xmath207 is then estimated to be @xmath208khz with @xmath209 , where @xmath210 nm such that the transverse pumping laser is blue detuned with respect to the atomic transition .",
    "then , the parameters in fig .  2 of the main text can be satisfied by choosing : @xmath211nk , @xmath212mhz , @xmath213ghz , and @xmath214mhz . under these parameters ,",
    "we have shown in the main text that the topological phase transition can be detected by measuring the spin - selective momentum distribution or by measuring the cavity photons leaking out of the cavity .    at a higher temperature of @xmath215nk",
    "( i.e. , @xmath216 ) , and with the fermi energy slightly deviated from the half - filling condition , we find that both signals are still present ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : signal ] ) .",
    "one may still detect the topological phase transition by looking at the abrupt change of the momentum space density distribution of spin - down atoms at @xmath217 and of spin - up atoms at @xmath19 ; or by looking at the peak structure in the derivative of the cavity photon number .",
    "we have also checked that with more atoms in the cavity , the requirements on the cavity parameters can be considerably relaxed .",
    "for example , if we consider the case where there are @xmath218 atoms in the optical cavity , then at a temperature of @xmath216 ( @xmath219nk for @xmath50li atoms ) , we can obtain a similar phase diagram , with the tetracritical point located at @xmath220 , @xmath88 . for @xmath50li atoms ,",
    "this may be satisfied by choosing more favorable parameters , e.g. , a weaker cavity - atom coupling @xmath221mhz , a larger single - photon detuning @xmath222ghz , and a larger cavity decay rate @xmath223mhz .",

    "<S> firstly , the abrupt change in @xmath92 at the gap closing point in momentum space across the tsr  </S>",
    "<S> sr phase boundary is uniquely associated with the change of winding number ( see fig .  [ </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : detection]a , b ) . </S>",
    "<S> this abrupt change can in principle be detected using the spin - selective time - of - flight imaging technique . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , at the gap closing point , a spin - up fermion with @xmath19 can be scattered by a cavity photon into a spin - down state at @xmath93 with the same energy . </S>",
    "<S> this nesting condition at the gap closing point leads to a peak in the derivative of the cavity photon number at the topological phase boundary ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : detection]c , d ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , by monitoring the photons leaking out of the cavity , one may detect both the sr phase transition and the tsr  sr topological phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> we have checked that both signals are robust against small fermi - energy deviations at higher temperatures  @xcite .    _ </S>",
    "<S> final remarks_. experimentally , quasi - one - dimensional fermi gases can be prepared by imposing a two - dimensional lattice potential with tight transverse confinement , leading to an array of quasi - one - dimensional atomic gases with large number of atoms . with more atoms in the cavity , </S>",
    "<S> the tsr phase and the corresponding phase transition can emerge at more favorable parameters such as weaker atom - cavity couplings , larger single - photon detunings , and larger cavity decay rates  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we note that our scheme can be straightforwardly extended to quasi - two - dimensional fermi gases in a cavity , where a tsr phase should also exist , as the single - band tight - binding hamiltonian just beyond the sr transition therein can be mapped onto that of a quantum anomalous hall system  @xcite .    _ </S>",
