    "the two - photon processes may lead to production of two charged leptons and therefore compete with other sources of dileptons , such as continuum drell - yan processes or resonant production of vector quarkonia or @xmath3 boson , which produce dilepton pairs of large invariant masses .",
    "earlier studies of lepton pair production via @xmath4 fusion in inelastic proton - proton collisions can be found in @xcite . for a general review of the @xmath5-fusion mechanism ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "inelastic processes are also included in the monte - carlo generator lpair based on @xcite",
    ".    at high energies and small dilepton transverse momenta also semi - leptonic decays of pair - wise produced charmed @xmath6 mesons may be an important ingredient of dileptons @xcite .",
    "actual contribution of different processes depends strongly on the details of experimental cuts .",
    "the color singlet exchange of photons naturally leads to rapidity gaps .",
    "if the rapidity veto on particles close to the @xmath7 vertex is imposed in addition one can enhance the relative contribution of the @xmath5 processes compared to the qcd drell - yan mechanism @xcite .",
    "the invariant mass distribution of dileptons produced in the drell - yan processes can be calculated in collinear - factorization approach ( see e.g. the textbook @xcite ) .",
    "if one wants to address more differential distributions , say in transverse momentum of the lepton pair , one can turn to @xmath8-space resummation @xcite or , especially in the small-@xmath9 kinematics , @xmath1-factorization ( see @xcite for instance ) .    in this paper",
    "we wish to concentrate on the photon - photon induced production of charged leptons .",
    "realistic estimation of these processes requires more attention . in general",
    ", there are three types of such processes which can be classified according to whether the proton remnants appearing `` after '' photon emission are just protons or baryon resonances or a complicated continuum ( see fig.[fig : diagrams ] ) . in principle , the elastic - elastic , processes with one elastic and one inelastic or double inelastic processes can be distinguished by detailed studies of the final state .",
    "however , in practice this separation may be not easy and all of them should be considered . here",
    "we wish to concentrate rather on inelastic - inelastic processes .",
    "+      there are two approaches in the literature in this context . in one of the approaches one can treat photons as collinear partons in the proton .",
    "the application of this approach requires presence of a hard scale ( e.g. a large photon virtuality or large lepton transverse momenta ) .",
    "such photon partonic distributions were discussed in @xcite . in some of these approaches",
    "the photon pdf enters the dglap evolution equations .",
    "the treatment in @xcite is somewhat simplified , here only the @xmath10 splitting is taken into account .",
    "below we wish to comment on the interrelation between the two approaches .",
    "the photon pdf approach was applied in many phenomenological studies , e.g. to a number of photon - photon processes in @xcite , and to dilepton production in @xcite .    in another approach one",
    "parametrizes the @xmath11 vertices in terms of the proton s structure functions .",
    "one can assume that the photons are either collinear or allow them to have transverse momenta and nonzero virtualities @xcite .",
    "recently we used a slightly simplified approach @xcite , which takes advantage of the high - energy limit and is formulated in an analogous way as the @xmath1-factorization approach often used in the context of two - gluon processes . in this approach",
    "one uses unintegrated photon distributions , in contrast to collinear distributions in the previous approach and off - shell matrix elements for the @xmath12 subprocess .",
    "we shall use this approach also in the present paper .",
    "the unintegrated photon distributions can be expressed in terms of the proton structure functions .",
    "the structure functions were measured in some different corners of very rich phase space .",
    "in particular they were studied in so - called deep - inelastic regime with large @xmath13 where perturbative treatment embedded in the dglap evolution equation applies . in this corner of the phase space",
    "the structure functions are very well known . when going outside of the perturbative regime the situation is less clear .",
    "several parametrizations were presented in the literature @xcite .",
    "the applicability of the different parametrizations is limited and not well tested .",
    "thus in two - photon processes one may need structure functions in very different corners of the @xmath14 space .",
    "it is not clear a priori which regions are needed for particular experiments i.e. specific kinematical cuts .",
    "we wish to discuss some examples related to particular past and modern experiments .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : fluxes ] , we briefly review the different formalism employed in our calculations .",
    "we also discuss the different structure functions used as an input in the @xmath1-factorization approach . in section [ sec : results ] we show our numerical results of various dilepton distributions for the kinematics , and cuts , relevant for different experiments .",
    "these are , at the presently highest available energies , atlas and cms , which measure central rapidities , and lhcb with coverage at forward rapidities .",
    "we also discuss examples for the lower energies of rhic , as well as data taken in 1980 s at the isr at still lower energy .",
    "we summarize our results in conclusions section .",
    "production of lepton pairs at large transverse momenta is a hard process , to which standard arguments for factorization apply , and collinear factorization should be an appropriate starting point to calculate e.g. rapidity or transverse momentum spectra of leptons .",
    "in fact , the dominant contribution to large - invariant mass dilepton pairs is of course the well known drell - yan process , but nothing prevents us from also including photon as partons along with quarks and gluons .",
    "then the photon parton distribution , @xmath15 , of photons carrying a fraction @xmath16 of the proton s light - cone momentum , obeys the dglap equation , @xmath17 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + p_{\\gamma \\leftarrow \\gamma}(y ) \\gamma\\big({z",
    "\\over y},q^2\\big ) \\big \\ } \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the complete set of dglap equations this photon density is then again coupled to the quark and antiquark distributions : @xmath18 due to the smallness of @xmath19 one would expect that the effect of photons on the quark and antiquark densities can be safely neglected , unless one is interested in high order perturbative corrections to the qcd splitting functions themselves .",
    "accordingly , we find two different approaches to dglap photons in the literature .    a first one , by glck et al .",
    "@xcite asserts , that we can neglect the photon density on the right hand side of the evolution equations .",
    "then , at sufficiently large virtuality @xmath20 , the photon parton density can be calculated from the collinear splitting of quarks and antiquarks @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 \\ ; . \\label{eq : dortmund}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this equation is easily integrated , and gives the photon parton density as @xmath23 + \\gamma(z , q_0 ^ 2 ) \\nonumber \\\\ & = & { { { \\alpha_{\\mathrm{em}}}}\\over 2 \\pi } \\int_{q_0 ^ 2}^{q^2 } { d \\mu^2 \\over \\mu^2 } \\int_z^1 { dx \\over x }    p_{\\gamma \\leftarrow q}\\big({z \\over x}\\big ) { f_2(x,\\mu^2 ) \\over x }   + \\gamma(z , q_0 ^ 2 ) \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one is left to specify  from some model considerations  the photon density at some low scale @xmath24 , but one may hope that at very large @xmath25 the part predicted perturbatively from quark and antiquark distributions dominates .",
    "in addition to the above contribution from dglap splitting , glck et al . also add the weizscker - williams flux from the coherent emission @xmath26 without proton breakup as found in @xcite .",
    "more recently , the durham @xcite and nnpdf @xcite groups have given a more involved treatment , in which the photon distribution is fully incorporated into the coupled dglap evolution equation . as usual with dglap evolution , the photon parton density at a starting scale @xmath24 needs to be specified . while @xcite present model approaches , in ref.@xcite an ambitious attempt to obtain @xmath24 from a fit to experimental data is found .",
    "preliminary work by the cteq collaboration @xcite is also based on qed corrected dglap equations , and attempts to fit the photon distribution from the prompt photon production @xmath27 at hera where in part of the phase space the compton subprocess @xmath28 contributes .",
    "it should be noted , that in the approach of @xcite , the input distribution @xmath24 contains the coherent or elastic contribution with an intact proton in the final state .",
    "notice that due to the proton form factors the integral over virtualities in the elastic case quickly converges , and the elastic contribution is basically independent of @xmath20 , as soon as @xmath29 .      in the collinear approach the photon - photon contribution to inclusive cross section for dilepton production can be written as : @xmath30 here @xmath31 above indices @xmath32 and @xmath33 denote @xmath34 , i.e. they correspond to elastic or inelastic components similarly as for the @xmath1-factorization discussed in section [ sec : fluxes ] below , see also the diagrams in fig.[fig : diagrams ] . the factorization scale is chosen as @xmath35 .",
    "the elastic photon distributions can be calculated with the help of elastic electromagnetic proton form factors .",
    "the functions @xmath36 are precisely the dglap evolved distributions of section [ subsec : dglap - photons ] above .      in the mrst2004(qed ) approach the initial photon distribution is parametrized as @xcite : @xmath37 \\cdot \\frac{1+(1-y)^2}{y } \\;.",

    "it would seem more reasonable to use rather constituent quark masses than the current ones .",
    "we will show that this leads to large differences in photon distributions at finite running scales @xmath13 .    before discussing results for cross sections for @xmath7 production",
    "we wish to concentrate for a while on the collinear photon distributions . to illustrate the effect of the initial input in fig.[fig : collinear_photon_pdf ] we show both original mrst2004(qed ) photon distribution and similar result obtained by ignoring the initial input which , as discussed above , may be questionable .",

    ", the invariant cross section is written as a convolution of density matrices of photons in the beam particles , and helicity amplitudes for the @xmath45 process . in a high energy limit , where dileptons carry only a small fraction of the total center - of - mass energy , the density - matrix structure can be very much simplified , and there emerges a @xmath1-factorization representation of the cross section @xcite .",

    "therefore a reliable predictions with accuracy better than 10 % are possible . in contrast , for the old isr @xcite and more recent phenix @xcite experiments substantial contributions come from the regions @xmath117 3 gev and @xmath118 1 gev . in this case",
    "one should use explicit parametrizations which fit experimental data in this corner of the space . the calculation should take into account also resonance contributions .    in the present paper",
    "we have discussed production of dileptons .",
    "similar analysis may be repeated e.g. for photon - photon induced production of @xmath119 pairs .",
