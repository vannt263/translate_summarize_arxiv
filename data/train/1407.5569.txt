    "a preliminary survey of mission target body is important to implement the space project smoothly and safely .",
    "hayabusa 2 is the successor to the original hayabusa mission , which was concluded with great success in obtaining samples from sub - km s - type asteroid ( 25143 ) itokawa ( 1998 sf36 ) .",
    "a near - earth asteroid , ( 162173 ) 1999 ju3 ( hereafter ju3 ) , is a primary target asteroid for the hayabusa 2 .",
    "the spacecraft is scheduled to launch in late 2014 , arrive at ju3 in 2018 , and return to earth with the asteroidal sample around late 2020 .",
    "the physical properties of ju3 were investigated from earthbound orbit under favorable observational conditions in 20072008 and 20112012 .",
    "it is classified as a c - type asteroid on the basis of optical and near - infrared spectroscopic observations @xcite .",
    "optical lightcurve observations indicated that ju3 is nearly spherical with an axis ratio of 1.11.2 and a synodic rotational period of 7.625 @xmath5 0.003 h @xcite .",
    "mid - infrared photometry revealed that the asteroid has an effective diameter of @xmath170.9 km @xcite .",
    "@xcite recently constructed a sophisticated thermal model for ju3 .",
    "they determined an effective diameter of 870 @xmath5 10 m as well as the possible pole orientation and thermal inertia .",
    "motivated by their work , we thoroughly investigated the surface optical properties of ju3 as part of the activity of the hayabusa 2 project .",
    "this paper thus aims to determine the geometric albedo , taking into account the updated effective diameter , and characterize the optical properties useful for remote - sensing observations .",
    "in particular , we emphasized the analysis of photometric data at low phase angles . in section 2",
    ", we describe the data acquisition and analysis . in section 3",
    ", we employ three photometric models to fit the magnitude ",
    "phase relation .",
    "finally , we discuss our results in section 4 in terms of the mission target of hayabusa 2 .",
    "figure [ fig : f1 ] shows the predicted v - band magnitudes and phase angles for given dates in 20072016 obtained by nasa / jpl s horizons ephemeris generator .",
    "the data set in 20072008 covers a large phase angle ( up to 90 ) , whereas that in 20112012 covers intermediate to low phase angles ( down to 0.3 ) .",
    "the combined data thus provide a unique data set for studying the magnitude ",
    "phase relation of the c - type asteroid in a wide phase angle range in which main - belt asteroids can not be observed from earthbound orbit .",
    "a worldwide optical observation campaign for ju3 was conducted in 20112012 not only to support the hayabusa 2 project but also to explore the physical nature of the target asteroid . in particular , the campaign gave considerable weight to acquiring the relative magnitudes for deriving the rotational period and shape model @xcite . among the campaign data , we selected magnitude data taken with calibration standard stars under good weather conditions . in addition , we chose data with a substantial signal - to - noise ratio ( i.e. , s / n @xmath18 10 ) and/or data with even phase angle coverage .",
    "we also placed a priority on data at low phase angles . in total , we selected data for ju3 taken on 21 nights with 8 telescopes .    the journal of observations is summarized in table [ table : journal ] , which includes observations in @xcite , whose magnitude data were calibrated in a standard manner using photometric standard stars but are not published in any journal .",
    "the data we used in this work were taken with the following telescopes and instruments : the university of hawaii 2.2-m telescope ( uh2.2 m ) with the tektronix 2048 @xmath19 2048 pixel ccd camera ( tek2k ) atop mauna kea , usa ; the magellan i 6.5-m baade telescope ( magellan-1 ) with the inamori magellan areal camera and spectrograph ( imacs ) ; the magellan ii 6.5-m clay telescope ( magellan-2 ) with the low dispersion survey spectrograph ( ldss3 ) at the las campanas observatory , chile ; the eso / mpi 2.2-m telescope ( eso / mpi ) with the 7-channel imager , grond , at @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath0 , and @xmath25 @xcite at the la silla observatory , chile ; the nayuta 2.0-m telescope ( nayuta ) with the 2048 @xmath19 2064 pixel multiband imager ( mint ) at the nishi - harima astronomical observatory , japan ; the indian institute of astrophysics 2.0-m himalayan chandra telescope ( hct ) with the himalayan faint object spectrograph camera ( hfosc ) at the indian astronomical observatory , india ; the tenagra ii 0.81-m telescope ( tenagra ii ) with the 1k @xmath19 1k ccd camera ( 1kccd ) in arizona , usa ; and the infrared survey facility 1.4-m telescope ( irsf ) with the simultaneous three - color infrared imager ( sirius ) @xcite at the south african astronomical observatory , south africa .",
    "all but one of these telescopes were operated in a non - sidereal tracking mode , whereas the hct was operated in a sidereal tracking mode .",
    "all the instruments were employed in an imaging mode with the standard broadband astronomical filters listed in table [ table : journal ] .",
    "in addition to these new data taken in 20112012 , we re - analyzed some of the data taken in 2007 with the 1-m telescope at lulin observatory with the 1k @xmath19 1k ccd camera ( taiwan ) and the steward observatory 1-m telescope in arizona ( usa ) .",
    "the observed images were analyzed in the standard way for ccd imaging data .",
    "the raw data were subtracted using bias frames ( zero exposure ) or dark frames ( if the instruments were not cooled sufficiently to suppress dark current ) that were taken at intervals throughout each night .",
    "we used median - stacked data frames using object frames to construct flat - field images with which to correct for vignetting of the optics and pixel - to - pixel variation in the detector s response .",
    "the aperture photometry was conducted using the _ apphot package _ in iraf , which provides the magnitude within synthetic circular apertures projected onto the sky .",
    "the parameters for the aperture photometry were determined manually depending on the image quality , but in principle , we set an aperture radius of about 23 times the full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) , which is large enough to enclose the detected flux of the asteroids and standard stars .",
    "the sky background was determined within a concentric annulus having projected inner and outer radii of @xmath173@xmath19fwhm and @xmath174@xmath19fwhm for point objects , respectively .",

    ", we made a follow - up observation of the same sky field with the uh2.2 m and the same filter system .",
    "as described above , our data were obtained with a variety of filters . to derive the magnitude  phase relation of ju3 using these data , we first examined the color relations among the observed filter bands .",
    "the spectra of ju3 at 0.440.94  has been studied well and shows no rotational variability at the level of a few percent @xcite .",
    "we calculated the color indices using the spectrum in @xcite , where they combined optical and near - infrared spectra taken at the mmt observatory and the nasainfrared telescope facility ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we considered that the observed asteroid spectrum is a product of the asteroid s reflectance and the solar spectrum , and calculated the color indices ( differences in magnitudes at two different bands ) using the following equation :    @xmath30    where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the reflectances at the effective wavelengths of the @xmath33-th and @xmath34-th band filters , respectively , and @xmath35 is the color index of the sun between the @xmath33-th and @xmath34-th bands .",

    "the observed color indices except for @xmath20-@xmath24 ( taken with grond ) were found to match the calculated color indices to within the accuracy of our measurements ( @xmath175% ) .",
    "we noticed that the @xmath20 magnitude taken with grond has an ambiguity in the calibration process due to unstable weather ; it seems that the calculated @xmath20-@xmath24 color index could be more reliable than the observed one .",
    "hereafter , we adopted the calculated color indices for deriving the corresponding @xmath27 magnitude and tolerated the uncertainty of 5% associated with the photometric system conversion in the following discussion .",
    "in addition to the phase angle dependence , the observed magnitude of the asteroid changed in time because of its rotation . for ju3 ,",
    "the rotational effect results in a magnitude change no larger than @xmath170.1 mag with respect to the mean magnitude because it is nearly spherical with an axis ratio of 1.11.2 @xcite . to determine the magnitude ",
    "phase relation , we corrected the rotational modulation and derived the magnitude averaged over the rotational phase .",
    "if observations cover both the peak and the trough , we can derive the mean magnitude as a representative value from a single - night observation .",
    "however , because most of the data could not cover a substantial portion of the rotational phase , we may mistake the mean magnitudes .",
    "although the effect is not as large as a half - amplitude of the lightcurve ( i.e. , 0.1 mag or less ) , we corrected the rotational effect in 2012 data by deriving the zeroth - order term from the nightly data using an empirical fourier model to describe the relative magnitude change due to the rotation of ju3 .",

    "no significant difference is found between ju3 and the other dark asteroids , most likely because the error is not small enough to detect such a solar distance effect .      finally , we employed the hapke model @xcite .",

    "we noticed that the resultant albedos are independent of the surface roughness , although the other hapke parameters depend on the assumed roughness .",

    ", each error in the magnitude data taken with a variety of filters and instruments seems to be randomized , which provides a reliable absolute magnitude .",
    "we obtained a fitting error of the absolute magnitude of 0.03 mag .",
    "it is important to note that the absolute magnitude we derived differs greatly ( 0.4 mag ) from that in the previous study @xcite , which was obtained on the basis of observation at @xmath107 22and is commonly referred to in previous research to derive the geometric albedo @xcite . in general , the absolute magnitudes of main - belt asteroids have been determined through ground - based observations at @xmath108 .",
    "it is likely that @xcite might lead inadequate result in the absolute magnitude due to the paucity of data at low phase angles .",
    "because our data set covers low phase angles almost equivalent to half of the apparent solar disk size , it provides a more reliable absolute magnitude without extrapolating the phase function .",
    "a drawback of our measurement is that we ignored the wavelength dependence of the magnitude  phase relation .",
    "in fact , the single scattering albedo ( @xmath9 ) and opposition surge width ( @xmath12 ) of s - type asteroids itokawa and eros exhibit strong wavelength dependences @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : f2 ] shows the magnitude ",
    "phase relation for the various filters . in particular",
    ", we have @xmath24-band and @xmath28-band data at @xmath3 10 . because the phase slopes of these two bands are nearly the same",
    ", we conjecture that the magnitude ",
    "phase relation is less dependent on the wavelength . in general , the observed magnitude ",
    "phase relation can be influenced by a combination of the shadow - hiding effect and coherent backscattering mechanism , and these effects depend on the geometric albedo @xcite .",
    "unlike itokawa and eros , which have very red spectra with moderate absorption around 1 , ju3 has almost constant reflectance from 0.45  to @xmath171.5   @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we may attribute the weak wavelength dependence of the phase curve to the flat spectrum of ju3 .",
    "regarding the errors of the hapke parameters , a large uncertainty remains because of the undetermined @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath60 derived by shevchenko s function is equivalent to that derived by the hapke function , suggesting that three - parameter fitting for shevchenko s function is mathematically sufficient to characterize the observed magnitude ",

    "it seems that @xmath26 and @xmath12 characterize the shape and amplitude of the opposition effect , which correspond to a parameter , @xmath72 , in shevchenko s function , whereas the other two parameters adjust the vertical magnitude offset and the entire phase slope , which correspond to @xmath4 and @xmath73 in shevchenko s function . among the hapke parameters",
    ", we determined @xmath12 independently of @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath12 can be interpreted in terms of porosity and grain size of the optically active regolith . applying a model in @xcite and assuming a lunar - like grain size distribution with a ratio of the largest particle size to the smallest particle size of 10@xmath109",
    ", we obtained the porosity of 0.64 .",
    "the derived porosity suggests that the surface of ju3 may be covered with coarse regoliths ( @xmath1101 cm , using an empirical size ",

    "the primary goal of the hayabusa 2 mission is to bring back samples from a c - type asteroid or an asteroid analogous to c - type asteroids , following up on the hayabusa 1 mission , which returned a sample from the s - type asteroid itokawa @xcite .",
    "because of the similarity of the spectra , c - type asteroids are considered to be parent bodies of carbonaceous chondrite meteorites , which are abundant in organic materials and hydrous minerals . in the nominal plan , multiple samplings are scheduled to obtain different types of asteroid material on the basis of their composition and degrees of aqueous alteration and space weathering .",
    "because the reflectance at 0.55  depends mainly on the abundance of carbon compounds , the surface reflectance map will provide information useful for the selection of the sampling sites .",
    "therefore , speedy construction of the reflectance map is crucial to the project s success .",
    "the observed reflectances at given wavelengths should be converted to a standard geometry consisting of the incident angle @xmath111 = 30 emission angle @xmath112 = 0 , and phase angle @xmath2 = 30using a photometric model . among the models ,",
    "the hapke model has been widely used to correct data taken with spacecraft onboard cameras ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . through this work ,",
    "we have determined the hapke parameters except for the surface roughness .",
    "because the disk - resolved reflectance is sensitive to the surface roughness , we expect that it will be obtained uniquely once the ju3 images are taken .",
    "we thus propose to determine the surface roughness while fixing the other four parameters on a restricted basis by the magnitude  phase relation .",
    "the construction of ju3 s shape model is essential to calculating the incident and emission angles .",
    "once the shape is determined , we expect that the full set of hapke parameters will be fixed using the images taken with the onboard cameras .",
    "our work provides useful information for the calibration of the onboard remote - sensing devices such as the optical navigation camera ( onc ) and the deployable camera ( dcam ) .",

    "similar to the procedure on the hayabusa 1 mission , measurements of ju3 s lightcurve are planned for the purpose of flux calibration @xcite .",
    "a comparison of the magnitude  phase relation in this paper and the observed disk - integrated data count will enable the determination of the calibration factors , as we did using stellar observations during the cruising phase for hayabusa asteroid multi - band imaging camera ( amica ) @xcite .",
    "unlike the case of amica for hayabusa 1 , we expect that the calibration parameters will be determined easily thanks to the accurate photometric models in this paper .",
    "we examined the magnitude  phase relation of ( 162173 ) 1999 ju3 using data taken from ground - based observatories .",
    "the major findings of this paper are as follows :    1 .    the iau @xmath0@xmath1 formalism does not fit the observed data at small and large phase angles ( @xmath2 @xmath68 2  and @xmath2 @xmath18 50 ) simultaneously using a single set of parameters . by fitting the data",
    "set at @xmath2 @xmath68 30 , we obtained values of @xmath4 = 19.22 @xmath5 0.02 and @xmath1 = 0.13 @xmath5 0.02 .",
    "2 .    using the shevchenko function",
    ", we found that the magnitude ",
    "phase relation exhibits linear behavior in a wide range of phase angles ( @xmath2 = 575 ) and shows weak nonlinear opposition brightening at @xmath3 5 . the phase slope ( 0.039 @xmath5 0.001 mag deg@xmath6 ) and opposition effect amplitude ( parameterized by the ratio of intensity at @xmath2=0.3to that at @xmath2=5 , @xmath7/@xmath8=1.31@xmath50.05 ) are consistent with those of typical c - type asteroids .",
    "3 .    we were not able to uniquely constrain the full set of parameters in the hapke model , but were able to find the best - fit values for four parameters given a range of fixed values for the surface roughness parameter . assuming @xmath13=20(the typical value for c - type asteroids , @xcite )",
    ", we obtained @xmath9=0.041 , @xmath10=-0.38 , @xmath11=1.43 , and @xmath12=0.050 .",
    "the results obtained are consistent with those of the c - type asteroid mathilde .",
    "4 .    by combining this study with a thermal model of asteroids ( mller et al . in preparation ) , we obtained a geometric albedo of @xmath14 = 0.047 @xmath5 0.003 , a phase integral of @xmath15 = 0.32 @xmath5 0.03 , and a bond albedo of @xmath16 = 0.014 @xmath5 0.002 .     + this research was supported by the korea research council of fundamental science & technology and by the korea astronomy and space science institute .",
