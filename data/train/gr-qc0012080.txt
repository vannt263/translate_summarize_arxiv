    "in using the einstein equations for a matter distribution in the form of a set of point - like mass constituents , there is a problem of adequate application , or validity , of the einstein equations when such a matter distribution is substituted by a continuous matter distribution while the field operator in the left - hand side of the equations is kept unchanged .",
    "this problem as it stands in cosmology is called _ the averaging problem _",

    "the averaged equations ( [ averee:1 ] ) become @xmath12 here @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the averaged inverse metric and the ricci tensors which are supposed to describe the gravitational field due to the matter distribution @xmath15 . a simple important observation  @xcite",
    "now is that the averaged einstein equations ( [ averee:2 ] ) are still not",
    " real \" field equations - just a definition of the correlation tensor @xmath16 as a difference between ( [ averee:1 ] ) and ( [ averee:2 ] ) .",

    "a covariant space - time volume averaging procedure for tensor fields  @xcite , has been defined and proved to exist on arbitrary riemannian space - times with well - defined properties of the averages . upon utilizing the averaging scheme",
    ", the macroscopic gravity approach has shown that ( _ i _ ) averaging out cartan s structure equations brings about the structure equations for the averaged ( macroscopic ) non - riemannian geometry and the definition and the properties of the correlation tensor @xmath16 , ( _ ii _ ) the averaged einstein s equations ( [ averee:2 ] ) become then the macroscopic field equations and they must be supplemented by a set of differential equations for the correlation tensor , ( _ iii _ ) it is always possible to extract the field operator of the form ( [ ee ] ) for the riemannian macroscopic metric tensor @xmath20 and its ricci tensor @xmath21 with all other non - riemannian correlation terms going to the right - hand side of ( [ averee:2 ] ) to give geometric correction to the averaged energy - momentum tensor @xmath15 .",
    "it is been also shown  @xcite that only in case of neglecting all correlations of the gravitational field the averaged equations ( [ averee:2 ] ) becomes the macroscopic einstein equations with a continuous matter distribution @xmath22 which reveals the physical status of using the standard procedure in cosmology of claiming ( [ averee:2 ] ) to be the einstein equations ( [ macroee ] ) after substitution of the matter model ( [ aver - dmd ] ) .",
    "the physical meaning , dynamical role and magnitude of the gravitational correlations must be elucidated in various physical settings .",
    "there is some evidence that they can not be negligible for cosmological evolution ( see , for example  @xcite for an estimation of the age of universe in a second order perturbation approach ) .",
    "derivation of the macroscopic ( averaged ) maxwell field operator in macroscopic electrodynamics is easily accomplished due its linear field structure and the main problem consists in the construction of models of macroscopic electromagnetic media ( for example , diamagnetics , magnetics , waveguides , etc . )",
    "@xcite , which relates to the structure of the averaged current . in general relativity",
    "the problem of construction of macroscopic gravitating medium models is hardly elaborated due to the following reasons : ( a ) existing mathematical and physical difficulties in establishing the form of the averaged ( macroscopic ) operator in ( [ averee:2 ] ) for the field equations of macroscopic gravity recedes the interest in development of macroscopic gravitating media ; ( b ) posing on its own more or less realistic problem with a discrete matter creates mathematical and physical problems due to nonlinearity and non - trivial geometry of gravitation , to mention , for example , the @xmath23-body problem , the problem of statistical description of gravity , etc . and ( c ) being relied on physically motivated phenomenological arguments ( uniformity , isotropy , staticity , etc . ) most applications of general relativity deal with _ effective _ continuous media if even a starting physical model is discrete in its nature like in cosmology ( see section [ intro ] ) or in description of extended bodies in general relativity ( see  @xcite for discussion of the physical status of general relativity ) .",
    "the kinetic approach in physics is known to provide a general scheme for introduction of characteristics of continuous media with a _ known _ distribution function of a discrete configuration .",
    "but the advantages of such generality are often greatly weakened in particular applications by difficulties of solving the boltzmann equation to find a distribution function of interest .",
    "this applies to a great extent to general relativity where despite the formulation of the general relativistic boltzmann equation  @xcite the kinetic approach still remains useful for general definitions and considerations rather than being a working tool ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) to derive a specific model of a macroscopic medium .    in case of the macroscopic electrodynamics together with the volume space - time averaging on minkowski space - time the formalism of statistical distribution functions has been utilized ( see  @xcite and references therein ) and it is of importance for the mathematically well - posed derivation of the macroscopic theory and the general structure of averaged current starting from microscopic electrodynamics of point - like moving charges .",
    "further application of the macroscopic theory requires usually mainly phenomenological considerations to establish material relations between macroscopic average fields and induction field necessary to make an overdetermined system of macroscopic equations determined .",
    "a correct derivation of material relations is known to require  @xcite averaging the microscopic equations with a given microscopic matter model during accomplishing an averaging of the microscopic field equations .",
    "though it is the only self - consistent way , the elaboration of such kind of approach still remains a challenge even for simple physical settings .",
    "on the other hand , volume ( space , time , space - time ) averaging procedures maintain their importance , direct physical meaning in application to macroscopic settings and their extreme clearness and descriptiveness .",
    "a volume averaging is also known to be unavoidable in all macroscopic settings ( including statistical approaches )  @xcite and space - time averages of physical fields are known to have the physical meaning as directly measurable quantities  @xcite ( for discussion see  @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) . that greatly motivates and supports interest in applying approaches with various averaging schemes in physics despite corresponding ( mostly mathematical , not physical ) difficulties in the rigorous formulation of averaging procedures .",
    "the paper aims to approach the problem of construction of gravitating macroscopic media in general relativity by using an appropriate space - time averaging scheme .",
    "the approach of szekeres  @xcite to construct a tensor of gravitational quadruple polarization is based on the following assumptions : ( a ) the linearized theory of gravity on minkowski background ; ( b ) the linearized field equations are taken as the linearized bianchi identity to employ an analogy between gravitation and electromagnetism ; ( c ) the covariant method of molecular moments of kaufman is applied to construct a tensor of quadruple gravitational polarization .",

    "a distribution is a typical characteristic distance @xmath35 between neighbouring particles .",
    "then the corresponding microscopic energy - momentum tensor has the form @xmath36 d\\tau_i .\\ ] ] assume now that due to gravitation the particles form into groups , a kind of gravitational molecules , which will be labeled by index @xmath37 . from the physical point of view that means the presence of another parameter which is a characteristic size ( diameter ) @xmath38 of such a molecule with @xmath39 .",
    "it is a longwave _ macroscopic _ parameter and its presence in a microscopic system will be defining the dynamics of the system on the distances of order of @xmath38 .",

    "let us apply now the method of molecular moments of kaufman  @xcite to represent ( [ molec ] ) as a series expansion in powers of @xmath43 under assumption that the effective gravitational field which is created by moving gravitational molecules is a weak field and the perturbations of the gravitational field due to relative oscillations of gravitating particles in molecules are small compared with the mean effective field .",
    "after averaging out over a typical size of the gravitational molecule ( for an averaging procedure see  @xcite ) one gets in accordance with the szekeres procedure @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the energy - momentum tensor of molecules , which has the form similar to ( [ micro ] ) with substitution @xmath5 by @xmath37 , @xmath46 is the tensor of gravitational dipole polarization that can be incorporated into the quadrupole term , and @xmath47 the tensor of gravitational quadrupole polarization @xmath48 which has the symmetries of the riemann tensor .",
    "the expression for the covariant gravitational quadrupole moment @xmath49 is defined as @xmath50 where @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 upon averaging ( [ bianchi ] ) over the typical size of gravitational molecule the following equations were obtained : @xmath54 where @xmath55 } +   \\frac{1}{3 } \\eta_{\\rho [ \\mu } \\langle t^{\\rm ( micro ) } \\rangle _ { , \\nu ] } , \\ ] ] or @xmath56}\\ ] ] and @xmath57 the expression ( [ av - matter - current-2 ] ) is analogous to the expression for the averaged electromagnetic current @xmath58 for a bunch of charged particles moving along their world lines in the effective electromagnetic field in accordance with the microscopic equation ( [ maxwell ] ) with @xmath59 when particles are grouped into molecules  @xcite @xmath60 where the polarization tensor @xmath61 is defined as an average of the quadruple polarization moment of the molecules @xmath62 ( see  @xcite for details ) @xmath63 then equations ( [ av - bianchi ] ) can be rewritten as the macroscopic equations ) are known to have been proposed first in  @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath64 for the gravitational induction tensor @xmath65 defined as @xmath66 the macroscopic equations ( [ av - bianchi-2 ] ) are analogous to the maxwell macroscopic equations obtainable by means of averaging the microscopic equations ( [ maxwell ] ) with @xmath67 with taking into account ( [ av - current ] ) @xmath68 for the electromagnetic induction tensor @xmath69 defined as @xmath70 unfortunately , at this point the analogy between the electromagnetism and gravitation which holds on the level of ( [ bianchi ] ) , ( [ matter - current - conserv ] ) and ( [ maxwell ] ) , ( [ em - current - conserv ] ) breaks .",
    "indeed , the formal similarity of ( [ av - bianchi-2 ] ) , ( [ gr - induction ] ) and ( [ av - maxwell ] ) , ( [ em - induction ] ) does not possess the structural analogy between averaged electromagnetism and gravitation : ( a ) the gravitational induction tensor @xmath65 does not have any more the symmetries of the weyl tensor compared with @xmath69 keeping the symmetries of @xmath71 ; ( b ) it is constructed from the second derivatives of the polarization tensor @xmath72 compared with the linear algebraic structure of the electromagnetic induction tensor @xmath69 in terms of the polarization tensor @xmath73 - it is thus impossible to proceed with the formulation of phenomenological material relations between @xmath65 and @xmath74 as possible in electromagnetism ( relations between @xmath69 and @xmath75 , or amongst the fields @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) .",
    "even more important issue is that analysis of the macroscopic field equation ( [ av - bianchi ] ) @xmath81{c } { \\langle c_{\\mu \\nu \\rho \\sigma } { } \\rangle}^ { , \\rho}\\\\   { \\scriptscriptstyle { \\cal o}(e ) }   \\end{array } } = \\kappa \\langle j^{\\rm ( micro)}_{\\mu \\nu \\rho } \\rangle =   { \\begin{array}[t]{c } \\kappa j^{\\rm ( free)}_{\\mu \\nu \\rho } \\\\ { \\scriptscriptstyle { \\cal o}(1 ) } \\end{array } }   -   { \\begin{array}[t]{c } p_{\\mu",

    "the weyl tensor must be estimated in the perturbation theory up to the second order as it was done for the matter current @xmath84 in the left - hand side of ( [ bianchi ] ) . so considering some physical features of the polarization tensor neither the macroscopic equations ( [ av - bianchi ] ) , nor any other field equations had in fact been employed  @xcite .    on the basis of the expression @xmath85 the following material relations",
    "have been suggested @xmath86 where @xmath23 is the average number of molecules per unit volume , @xmath87 is the quadrupole moment of a molecule @xmath88 @xmath89 is the matter density in molecules , @xmath90 is a vector between neighbouring particles of a molecule .",
    "the quantity @xmath91 has been called the gravitational dielectric constant and in newtonian approximation found to be @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the average linear dimension of a typical molecule , @xmath94 is the average mass of the molecules , @xmath95 is a typical frequency of harmonically oscillating particles in molecules .",
    "the gravitational field created by the particles is defined by einstein s equation @xmath96 the einstein equations ( [ ein ] ) for the distribution ( [ molec ] ) are of the form : @xmath97    averaging the left - hand side of the einstein equations ( [ ein - molec ] ) following the isaacson s high - frequency approximation approach  @xcite , using the averaging procedure  @xcite ( one can also use the isaacson s averaging procedure  @xcite , see also @xcite ) and with taking into account ( [ polar ] ) brings the averaged einstein equations in the form : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is isaacson s energy - momentum tensor of gravitational waves  @xcite .",
    "all members in equation ( [ av - ein - molec ] ) can be shown to be of the same order of magnitude @xmath100 .",
    "the macroscopic equations ( [ av - ein - molec ] ) give the equations of motion for molecules ) represents a weak gravitational field on the flat background one can use the covariant derivatives with respect the metric in all relations instead of partial derivatives with respect to the flat metric . ]",
    "@xmath101 conservation of the energy - momentum of gravitational waves @xmath102 and an identity for the gravitational polarization @xmath103    the system of equations ( [ av - ein - molec])-([ident - polar ] ) is underdetermined - there are 20 unknown components of the tensor of gravitational polarization .",
    "it is possible to formulate two natural material relations .",
    "the first relation is between the traceless part of the quadrupole polarization tensor @xmath104 where @xmath105 , and traceless energy - momentum tensor of gravitational waves @xmath106 where @xmath107 .",
    "relation ( [ material-1 ] ) can be shown to be always valid in the geometrical optics limit .",
    "the second material relation connects the remaining part of the polarization tensor @xmath108 , its trace @xmath109 , with a projection of the curvature tensor on the world line of an observer ( electric part of the curvature tensor ) @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the observer 4-velocity ( 4-velocity of the molecule centre of mass ) and @xmath112 . the relation ( [ material-2 ] ) can be shown to lead to the correct expression for the 3-tensor of the average quadrupole gravitational moment ( [ quadruple ] ) so that @xmath113 then the material relation ( [ gr - material ] ) can be recovered in the form @xmath114 that gives @xmath115 with the gravitational dielectric constant @xmath91 defined by ( [ grav - dielectric - const ] ) .",
