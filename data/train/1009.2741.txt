    "transport coefficients are essential inputs to describe the space - time evolution of systems not far from equilibrium . during the last years",

    "is needed in order to obtain the leading - order result . in the strongly coupled regime ,",
    "the most prominent method available is the ads / cft correspondence , although it is only applicable to a limited class of field theories . on the other hand ,",
    "lattice simulations are still not accurate enough regarding the calculation of spectral densities , and the introduction of a finite quark chemical potential makes things even more difficult because of the sign problem .",
    "it was recently conjectured , based on a sum rule for the spectral density of the trace of the energy - momentum tensor in yang - mills theory @xcite , that a maximum of the trace anomaly near the critical temperature might drive a maximum for the bulk viscosity near that temperature .",
    "the corresponding sum rule was later corrected in @xcite , and the ansatz for the spectral density used to extract the bulk viscosity questioned @xcite . since the trace anomaly measures the breaking of scale invariance in a system , and the bulk viscosity @xmath1 essentially represents the difficulty for a system to relax back to equilibrium after a scale transformation , it seems in principle reasonable to think that @xmath1 would be maximum when the breaking of scale invariance is maximum .    in heavy - ion phenomenology ,",
    "bulk viscosity has usually been neglected because it is expected to be much smaller than the shear viscosity even at temperatures not very high @xcite . however , as suggested by the analysis of @xcite , non - perturbative phenomena responsible for the main contribution to the trace anomaly near @xmath2 could also produce a significant increase in the bulk viscosity . in this paper",
    "i will present an explicit calculation in the massive gross - neveu model in @xmath3 dimensions , where the correlation between trace anomaly and bulk viscosity can be accurately tested .",
    "i will not try to give an estimation for the absolute value of @xmath1 in qcd near the phase transition though ; as we will see this model is not suitable for that purpose .",
    "there are several works analyzing this issue employing different approaches ( see for instance @xcite and references therein ) , but still the order of magnitude of the bulk viscosity near the crossover temperature is uncertain .    in 1 + 1 dimensions , transverse flow of momentum is not possible , and the bulk viscosity is the only viscous coefficient present to linear order in gradients . in this paper",
    "i will analyze only finite temperature effects , considering a vanishing fermion chemical potential , thus the thermal conductivity will be zero in this case . therefore ,",

    "finally in [ sec : conclusions ] i summarize the main conclusions .",
    "there is also the appendix [ app : fermions ] , where the result of factorization for fermion loops in @xmath3 dimensions is derived , and appendix [ app : amplitudes ] where the reader can find some details on the calculation of the inelastic scattering amplitude .",

    "<S> this model resembles qcd in many important aspects : it is asymptotically free , has a dynamically generated mass gap , and for zero bare fermion mass it is scale invariant at the classical level ( broken through the trace anomaly at the quantum level ) . for our purposes , the introduction of a bare fermion mass is necessary to break the integrability of the model , and thus to be able to study momentum transport . </S>",
    "<S> the main motivation is , by decreasing the bare mass , to analyze whether there is a correlation between the maximum in the trace anomaly and a possible maximum in the bulk viscosity , as recently conjectured . </S>",
    "<S> after numerical analysis , i find that there is no direct correlation between these two quantities : the bulk viscosity of the model is a monotonously decreasing function of the temperature . </S>",
    "<S> i also comment on the sum rule for the spectral density in the bulk channel , as well as on implications of this analysis for other systems . </S>"
