    "the central density profile of dark matter halos has been the subject of considerable debate in recent years . on the theoretical side ,",
    "numerous groups have claimed that dissipationless n - body simulations in the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model produce universal halo profiles . despite vigorous debate over the exact shape of the inner profile",
    ", there is general agreement that predicted cdm halos have central density cusps , @xmath0 with @xmath2@xmath3 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the observational side ,",
    "similar controversy has raged over the question of whether such cusps are present in real galaxies , and whether their absence would challenge the cdm paradigm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the most difficult issue is accounting for the effects of baryonic matter , which contributes directly to the gravitational potential and may also modify the dark matter distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "strongly lensed arcs in galaxy clusters probe the gravitational potential on scales ( @xmath4@xmath5 kpc ) large enough to avoid significant baryonic contamination , and hence can provide a relatively clean test of the predictions of dissipationless n - body simulations .",
    "several groups have constrained the density profiles of individual clusters by studying their lensing properties @xcite , and in some cases have obtained stringent limits from combined strong- and weak - lensing analyses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another approach is to disentangle the baryonic and dark matter contributions to the net potential on small scales , similar to studies of galaxy rotation curves . @xcite",
    "have used the velocity dispersion profile of the cd galaxy in the cluster abell 2199 together with the kinematics of the cluster members to decompose the stellar and dark matter components .",

    "* hereafter s03 ) have gone a step further and combined dynamical and strong lensing analyses for six clusters .",
    "two of their clusters provide particularly tight and interesting results : inner slopes of @xmath8 for ms  2137@xmath923 and @xmath10 for abell 383 , which strongly conflict with the steep cusps predicted for cdm .",
    "such a conflict on cluster scales may be more troubling than similar conflicts on galaxy scales , as there are fewer proposed processes that are capable of disrupting dark matter cusps in clusters .    lccc @xmath11 [ @xmath12 & @xmath13 & @xmath14 & @xmath15 + @xmath16 & @xmath17 & @xmath17 & @xmath17 + @xmath18 & 0 & 0.2 & 0.2 + @xmath19 & 2 & 2.2 & 2.2 + @xmath20 & @xmath21 & @xmath22 & @xmath23 + @xmath24 [ @xmath25 $ ] & @xmath26 & @xmath27 & @xmath28 + @xmath29 & 9.6 & 4.7 & 24 + @xmath30 & @xmath31 & @xmath32 & @xmath33 + @xmath34 & 0 & 0.2 & 0.15 + @xmath35 & 0.4 & 1 & 0 + @xmath36 & 0.576 & 0.166 & 1.33    the s03 results are somewhat puzzling , however , as illustrated in figure  [ counterexample ] .",
    "this figure shows velocity dispersion profiles and representative lensed arcs for three models of abell 383 : the best - fit model found by s03 , a model with a @xmath7 dark matter cusp , and a model with @xmath37 .",
    "while the fit with a @xmath7 cusp is by no means perfect , it is clearly not ruled out at the 10-@xmath38 level ( as claimed by s03 ) .",
    "moreover , it is not significantly worse than the best - fit model presented by s03 .    in this paper",
    "we study the origin of this discrepancy .",
    "we argue that the tight constraints claimed by s03 result from assumptions made in their modeling . in particular , they assumed spherical symmetry and adopted particular values for the scale radius at which the dark matter density profile transitions from @xmath39 to @xmath40 . relaxing these assumptions",
    ", we find that no interesting constraints on the dark matter profile can be derived from the s03 data alone .",
    "however , more detailed modeling of the lensing properties of these clusters may yield stronger constraints .    after the completion of this paper",
    ", we became aware of independent work by @xcite , who reach similar conclusions .",
    "the observables modeled by s03 are the lensing critical radii ( basically the radii of the tangential and radial arcs ) and the velocity dispersion profiles of the brightest cluster galaxies ; the data are given in their tables 45 .",
    "for a given mass model , the critical radii are determined by projecting the density distribution and locating the singular points of the lens mapping ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , while the velocity dispersion profile is computed by solving the spherical jeans equation ( see appendix ) .",
    "we use a generalization of the two - component mass model used by s03 . for the stellar component",
    ", we use the @xmath41 model @xcite , @xmath42^{-1 } .\\ ] ] s03 mainly used a jaffe model , which is a particular case of the @xmath41 model with @xmath43 . following s03 , we describe the dark matter with a generalized nfw - type profile , @xmath44^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath45 .      in the s03 results abell 383 provided the strongest evidence that the dark matter slope is shallower than @xmath46 , so we use this cluster to study important systematic uncertainties in the analysis .",
    "if we center both the stellar and dark matter models on the observed central galaxy position , orient them along the observed galaxy position angle , and fix the stellar model s half - light radius to the observed galaxy effective radius ( @xmath17 ) , then the remaining model parameters are : the galaxy mass , inner slope , and ellipticity @xmath47 ; and the halo mass , scale radius , inner slope , and ellipticity @xmath48 .",
    "s03 used a spherical jaffe model for the stellar component ( @xmath43 and @xmath49 ) , and a spherical halo ( @xmath50 ) with scale radius @xmath51 kpc . with the same assumptions ,",
    "we reproduce their constraints on the dark matter inner slope @xmath35 .",
    "the surface brightness profile of the central galaxy , shown by @xcite , is steeper than expected for a jaffe model and so we adopt @xmath52 , however we note that this steep slope has been disputed ( r.  ellis 2003 , private communication ) .",
    "we find that with this stellar component the models can accommodate a somewhat steeper dark matter profile : with a @xmath43 galaxy the best - fit halo has @xmath53 , while with @xmath54 it shifts to @xmath55 .",
    "the shift of @xmath56 is comparable to various systematic effects considered by s03 .",
    "the model with a @xmath54 galaxy fits better than the s03 model ( with @xmath57 ) , so henceforth we focus on it .",
    "a larger effect is associated with the dark matter scale radius .",
    "the s03 constraints on @xmath35 depend crucially on their assumption of @xmath51 kpc , because there is a degeneracy between @xmath30 and the dark matter slope @xmath35 .",
    "for example , assuming @xmath58 kpc would yield @xmath59 , while assuming @xmath60 kpc would yield @xmath61 ( for spherical models ) .",
    "the latter model fits considerably better than the s03 model ( @xmath62 ) , even though s03 claimed that @xmath63 was excluded at 99% confidence . for spherical models",
    ", larger @xmath35 do require large scale radii @xmath30 : for example , the best - fitting model with @xmath64 has @xmath65 mpc ! such implausibly large scale radii ( or small concentrations ) would suggest that steep cusps are still disfavored , but that is very different from claiming that steep cusps are inconsistent with the data .",
    "the lesson is that @xmath30 must be treated as a free parameter , while keeping in mind that its value should be checked _ a posteriori _ for plausibility .",
    "the most dramatic effects arise upon dropping the assumption of spherical symmetry .",
    "the ellipticity of the galaxy is not exceedingly important ; we use the observed value @xmath66 and find that it does not significantly change the results .",
    "what matters most is the ellipticity of the halo .",
    "figure  [ a383e ] shows likelihood contours in the plane of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , optimizing over the other parameters ( @xmath11 , @xmath24 , and @xmath30 ) .",
    "we find that a broad range of dark matter slopes are consistent with the data .",
    "in the limit of spherical symmetry we recover the tight constraints on @xmath35 found by s03 , but if we allow even a relatively small ellipticity we find successful models over the range @xmath67 .",
    "thus , the limits found by s03 appear to be an artifact of their prior assumptions for the mass model , notably the assumption of spherical symmetry . note that the models we find with steeper inner slopes ( @xmath68 ) have perfectly sensible parameters from a theoretical standpoint .",
    "for example , model b in table  [ tab1 ] , with a @xmath69 cusp , has galaxy mass @xmath70 , halo mass @xmath71 , and a halo scale radius @xmath72 kpc , corresponding to a concentration of @xmath73 .",
    "these halo parameters are fully consistent with the virial masses and concentrations expected for hot ( @xmath74 kev ) x - ray luminous clusters .",
    "( note that with moderate ellipticities it is possible to have @xmath69 without an unphysically large scale radius . )",
    "the case of abell 383 suggests that simply combining the lensing critical radii with dynamical data can not strongly constrain the dark matter slope .",
    "fortunately , the use of more detailed lensing data and modeling can provide constraints on the ellipticity that significantly improve the constraints on the dark matter slope .",
    "to illustrate , we consider ms  2137@xmath923 .",
    "while s03 used only the lensing critical radii , @xcite identified multiple images of 26 distinct sources in the arcs produced by this cluster , enabling much more detailed modeling .",
    "additionally , the x - ray temperature has been measured to be @xmath75 kev @xcite , which can provide constraints on the halo mass via the @xmath76@xmath77 relation determined by @xcite for relaxed lensing clusters .",
    "we combine these data with the velocity dispersions from s03 , but we inflate the positional error bars on the multiply imaged knots reported by @xcite to @xmath78 , and inflate the error on the x - ray temperature to 1 kev , in order to maximize the impact of the velocity dispersions on the fit .",
    "( we neglect the 5th image claimed by @xcite , as its detection is tentative . )",
    "we again use two - component mass models , assuming the galaxy and dark matter halo to be concentric .",
    "we use the observed values of the galaxy half - light radius ( @xmath79 ) , ellipticity ( @xmath80 ) , and position angle . if we force the halo to be spherical and to have scale radius @xmath51 kpc we recover the same constraints on @xmath35 as s03 .",
    "however , if we allow the dark matter halo parameters to vary and optimize over them ( and also over the galaxy mass @xmath11 ) , we find the likelihood as a function of the dark matter slope @xmath35 shown in figure  [ ms2137 ] .",
    "the dark matter slope is constrained to be @xmath81 ( 95% confidence ) .",
    "this is quite consistent with the results found by @xcite , which perhaps is not too surprising : since we found earlier that the velocity dispersion data are not terribly restrictive , it is reasonable that the joint constraints from dynamics and detailed lens modeling are similar to those obtained from lens modeling alone .",
    "typical halo virial masses and concentrations obtained were roughly @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "incidentally , we find that mild halo ellipticities ( @xmath84 ) and mild misalignment between halo and galaxy ( @xmath85 ) are favored by the fits .",
    "we have argued that the stringent constraints claimed by @xcite on the inner slope of the dark matter profiles in clusters  @xmath86 for abell 383 , @xmath87 for ms  2137@xmath923  are not supported by their data .",
    "we have found successful models with dark matter slopes well outside these bounds .",
    "the models with steep slopes ( @xmath88 ) have sensible parameters : halo virial masses @xmath89 and concentrations @xmath90@xmath91 .",
    "it appears that the tight constraints obtained by s03 on the inner dark matter profile are artifacts of several simplifying assumptions in their modeling analysis .",
    "we have shown that the assumption of spherical symmetry and of a particular value of the halo scale radius artificially restricts the range of parameters consistent with the data .",
    "it may seem surprising that small departures from sphericity ( e.g. , ellipticities @xmath92@xmath93 ) generate such striking differences in the lensing properties of the clusters .",
    "however , as discussed by @xcite and @xcite , the strong lensing cross section for objects with shallow radial profiles is highly sensitive to small shear perturbations , arising for example from ellipticity . in other words , small changes in ellipticity",
    "elicit large changes in the size of the critical curves for lenses with shallow profiles .",
    "this extra degree of freedom in the models thwarts any attempts to derive tight constraints on the density profiles from the critical radii alone .",
    "the lack of strong constraints does not mean that lensed arcs are not useful probes of the inner structure of cluster dark matter halos .",
    "we have also shown that detailed modeling of lensed features and dynamics does allow interesting constraints to be placed on the inner potential . decomposing the central mass distribution in ms  2137@xmath923 into stellar and dark matter components , we found constraints on the dark matter inner slope of @xmath94 at 95% confidence .",
    "we would nt take this measurement too seriously , though .",
    "first , we have not fully explored the model parameter space  considering tidal shear from nearby halos or substructures within the cluster , or a radially varying ellipticity , could weaken the bounds on @xmath35 .",
    "second , it can be argued that decomposing the total mass into stellar and dark matter components , which is a standard approach , is not ideal . because the effects of baryonic mass on the dark matter distribution are poorly understood , the dark matter profile obtained by subtracting the baryonic component from the total mass might be very different from the profile the dark matter would have assumed in the absence of baryonic interference .",
    "for example , @xcite have suggested that the decomposition procedure could give the appearance of a cored dark matter distribution , even for proper cdm halos .",
    "thus , as with galaxy rotation curves , probing the dark matter on scales dominated by baryons is a perilous exercise .",
    "a much better test of cdm predictions would be to measure the profile on scales that are dm dominated .",
    "fortunately , giant arcs offer such a probe , since they occur on scales ( @xmath95@xmath5 kpc ) beyond the influence of central galaxies , yet well inside the @xmath0 regime expected in clusters .",
    "simple measurements of lensing critical radii are not enough , however ; detailed lens modeling is required .",
    "fortunately , the data to support such modeling are available , and several clusters have already yielded interesting ( and in some cases surprising ) measurements of their dark matter distributions ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
