    "but on the contrary , the complicated arrangement of the imaginary parts @xmath115 , @xmath114 , in the integrand of @xmath3 leads eventually to an increasing shear viscosity compared to the on - shell approximation .",
    "in this work we have investigated the shear viscosity of hot and dense quark matter described by a large-@xmath2 njl model for two flavors .",
    "we have used the kubo formalism and calculated the shear viscosity @xmath3 from a thermal quark spectral function with inclusion of its full dirac structure . instead of a single width",
    "there are now three ( off - shell ) imaginary parts which determine the positive - definite shear viscosity .    in the large-@xmath2 counting ,",
    "the dominant dissipative process arises from mesonic fluctuations .",
    "they are dynamically generated by virtual quark - antiquark loops resummed to all orders in the non - perturbative bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "the mesonic fock contribution to the gap equation are of subleading order @xmath21 .",
    "we have calculated the three components @xmath213 of the quark self - energy provided by the mesonic fock term , both for on - shell and off - shell kinematics .",
    "evaluating the kubo formula with the input @xmath214 , we have found a decreasing shear viscosity as function of both temperature and quark chemical potential . at vanishing chemical potential",
    ", the proper off - shell treatment extends the on - shell approximation into the low - temperature region where the on - shell viscous effects are kinematically excluded .",
    "apart from this , off - shell corrections have no further quantitative or qualitative influence .",
    "however , at finite quark chemical potentials , off - shell effects shift the shear viscosity to higher values but its overall qualitative behavior is not changed .",
    "we have observed that the dimensionless ratio @xmath0 undershoots the ads / cft benchmark @xmath180 at large enough temperatures in the njl model .",
    "combining our results for the shear viscosity with perturbative results from hard - thermal - loop calculations in the high-@xmath45 region , we find that the ratio @xmath0 develops a minimum well above the ads / cft benchmark .",
    "the interpolated results compare reasonably with those from lattice qcd regarding the overall behavior and scale of the ratio @xmath0 .",
    "however , since the chiral crossover temperature in the two - flavor njl model , @xmath215 , is larger than the lattice - qcd result , @xmath201 , the onset of the dominant viscous effects is shifted to higher temperatures by the mott condition .    in summary",
    "one can conclude that the correlated quark matter described by the njl model features a small ratio shear viscosity over entropy density as it is characteristic for a perfect fluid .",

    "<S> the general kubo formula is applied , incorporating the full dirac structure of the thermal quark spectral function and avoiding commonly used on - shell approximations . </S>",
    "<S> mesonic fluctuations contributing via fock diagrams provide the dominant dissipative processes . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting ratio @xmath0 ( shear viscosity over entropy density ) decreases with temperature and chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> interpolating between our njl results at low temperatures and hard - thermal - loop results at high temperatures a minimum slightly above the ads / cft benchmark @xmath1 is obtained . </S>"
