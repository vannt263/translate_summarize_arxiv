    "more than 50 percent of cosmic baryons is dark @xcite .",
    "the abundance , physical properties , and spatial distribution of such dark baryons constitute one of the most important unsolved problems in observational cosmology .",
    "recent numerical simulations suggest that a major fraction of dark baryons takes a form of whim ( warm / hot intergalactic medium ) roughly with temperature @xmath3 and over - density @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "whim traces the large - scale filamentary structure of mass ( dark matter ) distribution more faithfully than hot intracluster gas ( @xmath5 typically ) and galaxies both of which preferentially reside in clusters that form around the knot - like intersections of the filamentary regions ( e.g. , suto et al .",
    "2004a , 2004b ; kang et al . 2005 ) .",
    "this implies that whim carries important cosmological information in a complementary fashion to distributions of galaxies in optical and of clusters in x - ray .",
    "_ dios _ ( diffuse intergalactic oxygen surveyor ) is a dedicated soft x - ray mission which aims at unveiling dark baryons in the universe @xcite via oxygen emission from whim .",
    "detectability of such emission features was examined in detail both for mock blank survey ( @xcite ; hereafter paper i ) and for mock targeted survey of outskirts of clusters in the local universe ( @xcite ; hereafter paper ii ) .",
    "these authors find that approximately 20 percent of cosmic baryons leaves emission signatures detectable by _",
    "dios_. this fraction corresponds to a relatively higher temperature tail ( @xmath6 ) of the entire whim distribution , and is sensitive to the assumed metallicity of whim .",
    "they adopt a metallicity model proposed by @xcite and @xcite , but the metallicity of whim is admittedly very uncertain at this moment",
    ".    another complementary strategy of detecting elusive whim is to search for its absorption signatures .",
    "in fact , several independent groups reported successful detections of absorption lines of highly ionized metals in spectra of background qsos and clusters ; ovii and oviii @xcite , ovi at @xmath7 in the _ fuse _ spectrum of qso h1821 + 643 @xcite , and more recently o vii , n vii and nvi along the line of sight toward the blazar mkn 421 @xcite .",

    "while the above value seems to be in good agreement with that expected from the previous simulations @xcite , the estimate is still sensitive to the assumed temperature and metallicity of the whim along the single line of sight to mkn 421 even apart from its limited statistics .",
    "this paper examines the detectability of whim via absorption , instead of emission , lines using the same cosmological hydrodynamic simulation data as paper i. in particular we consider qsos as a bright x - ray lighthouse , and create mock absorption spectra for a future x - ray satellite mission , _ xeus _ ( x - ray evolving - universe spectroscopy ) .",
    "this methodology can be equally applied to gamma - ray burst ( grb ) x - ray afterglows as first proposed by @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows ; section 2 describes our methodology and model assumptions in computing mock transmission spectra of the qsos through whim .",
    "we present examples of mock spectra and their basic statistics in  3 .",
    "we discuss the detectability of whim via absorption in  4 and also consider how to extract physical properties of whim .",

    "we use the data of @xcite who performed a simulation with a hybrid code of particle  particle  particle  mesh ( pppm ) poisson solver and smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) .",
    "both dark matter and gas employ @xmath13 particles within a periodic simulation cube of @xmath14 per side ( in comoving ) .",

    "the simulation includes the effect of radiative cooling , but the energy feedback from supernova and the uv background heating are neglected .",
    "the simulation that we used here was performed in 2000 .",
    "this is why the adopted value of @xmath23 is @xmath24% smaller than more recent estimate , for instance , @xmath25 @xcite . in this sense",
    "our results may underestimate the real absorption signatures by the corresponding amount .",
    "we create a light - cone output for @xmath12 following the procedure described in paper i. the maximum value of @xmath2 is adopted so as to ensure that the oviii line is located in a spectrum region relatively free from the galactic confusion ( paper i ) , while this may be very conservative .",

    "the two peaks in the histogram correspond to loss which have single and double absorption line systems .",
    "if we assume @xmath198 k ( the ionization fraction of ovii peaks around this temperature ) , ovii absorption lines alone provides a fairly accurate estimate for @xmath199 @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have examined the detectability of whim via the absorption lines in a bright qso spectra using the cosmological hydrodynamic simulation .",
    "we created the mock _ xeus _ absorption spectra toward a bright qso assuming the collisional and photo - ionization equilibrium .",
    "we conclude that on average _ xeus _ will detect 1.58 ( o vii 574 ev ) and 0.37 ( oviii 654 ev ) per a random line - of - sight up to @xmath2 ( @xmath200 ) .",
    "if both ovii and oviii absorptions are detected ( @xmath201 chance ) for the same whim clump , one can estimate its temperature from their line ratios and attempt to infer the cosmic baryon density . as we discussed in detail",
    ", however , the reliable estimate requires several careful correction factors and still the resulting distribution function of the estimate is fairly wide .",
    "so any attempt on the basis of small statistical samples should be interpreted with caution .    in passing we have to emphasize once again that our simulation data adopted @xmath202 rather than the currently more favored value @xmath203 .",
    "also we restrict our current analysis up to @xmath2 where a spectrum is relatively free from the galactic confusion , but in principle one can explore whim systems at higher redshifts ( @xmath204 ) with qso(grb ) . therefore while our present conclusions concerning the detectability of whim in absorption toward a qso(grb ) may seem fairly modest , most likely they are very conservative .",
    "moreover the result is very sensitive to the metallicity of whim which is rather uncertain and is likely to significantly vary from place to place . given the strong metallicity dependence as shown in figure [ fig : metal_dep ] , what is relevant is not the mean metallicity of whim but the fraction of whim clumps which exhibit detectable equivalent width . in this respect ,",
    "the wide variation of the metallicity , even if its overall mean is @xmath205 as we most adopted here , is expected to _ systematically _ increase the detectability .    throughout this paper , we adopted @xmath206 with calorimeter on - board _ xeus _ in mind .",
    "current observations of whim by several grating detectors are indicative . with xeus s large effective area , whim absorption features will be collected with a much larger number of samples as a by - product of qso studies . with careful statical studies as we presented in this paper ,",
    "these significantly contribute to the proper understanding of physics of whim .",
    "if higher energy resolution with gratings , for example , @xmath207 at @xmath208 , becomes available in future , it is even possible to obtain line profile accurately and estimate the effect of turbulence .",
    "also one can study multiphase nature in a single absorption system .",
    "furthermore , since signal - to - noise ratio improves as @xmath209 , one can significantly increase the number of detectable oxygen and other ion absorption systems .",
    "these significantly contribute to the proper understanding of physics of whim @xcite .    in order to be more quantitative ,",
    "we need much more advanced simulation datasets which include more realistic physical processes such as radiative cooling , photo - ionization , star formation , supernova feedback , and metallicity evolution .",
    "this is exactly what we are performing , and we hope to revisit the above issues in due course .",
    "numerical computations presented in this paper were carried out at adac ( the astronomical data analysis center ) of the national astronomical observatory , japan ( project i d : mky05a ) .",
    "we thank the referee fabrizio nicastro for very constructive and useful comments .",
