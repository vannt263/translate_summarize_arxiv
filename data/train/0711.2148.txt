    "[ targetprojectiles ] .",
    "for the realization of collisions between dusty targets and dusty projectiles we developed a setup whose functionality is depicted in fig .",
    "[ setup ] .",
    "the experiments are performed under microgravity conditions within a pressurized capsule which is , prior to each impact experiment , held at the top of the microgravity drop tower in bremen . inside the experimental setup ,",
    "a set of five typically mm - sized projectile agglomerates is held in a device which is able to simultaneously release the projectiles when an electrical current is applied to two solenoid magnets .",
    "the projectiles release is done while the experiment capsule is still held at ambient gravitational acceleration . due to the gravitational acceleration ,",
    "the released projectiles gain vertical velocities proportional to their time of flight .",
    "after some preselected travel distance ( or time of flight ) , the experiment capsule is released to free fall .",
    "thus , the relative velocity between the projectiles and the target is frozen and the impacts happen at a residual acceleration level of less than @xmath40 , mimicking the conditions in protoplanetary disks .",
    "the free - fall height of the projectiles can be adjusted from @xmath41 cm to @xmath42 cm . due to a limited acceleration length of the projectiles of @xmath43 cm ,",
    "the _ maximum _ impact velocity is @xmath44 , while the _ actual _ impact velocity is only determined by the time lapse between projectile release and start of the free - fall phase of the whole experiment . for the simulation of random impacts , the target can be tilted by 30 and 60 degrees relative to the velocity vector of the projectiles . for the exclusion of aerodynamic effects during the collisions ,",
    "the experiment chamber is evacuated to less than 20 pa pressure .    during the free - fall time of 4.74 seconds , the impacts are observed by a set of different cameras and illumination schemes ( see fig .",
    "[ setup ] ) : ( 1 ) a high - speed ( 462 frames per second [ fps ] ) , high - resolution ( 1k @xmath45 1k pixels ) camera with a field of view ( fov ) of @xmath46 is arranged such that it observes the impacts tangential to the target surface ; the illumination is provided by a synchronized xe flash lamp with @xmath47 flash duration . due to the limited resolution , this camera can only detect particles @xmath48 .",
    "( 2 ) another high - speed ( 220 fps ) , low - resolution ( 256 @xmath45 256 pixels ) camera with a fov of @xmath49 can observe the impacts perpendicular ( in the case of non - normal impacts ) or almost perpendicular ( in the case of normal impacts ) to the target surface ; additional illumination is provided by a laser curtain with 30 mm width and 1 mm thickness parallel and close to the surface of the target ; this camera - illumination combination was specifically installed for detecting small fragments that are otherwise invisible .",
    "( 3 ) an additional low - speed ( 25 fps ) , low - resolution ( 720 @xmath45 576 pixels ) video camera with a fov of @xmath50 , located 30 degrees from the target normal , observes the target surface prior and after the impacts ; a point - source illumination for the determination of , e.g. , crater depths is provided by a halogen lamp located 32 degrees above the target s `` horizon '' .",
    "data analysis consists of a thorough image analysis including the determination of projectile sizes , impact velocities and impact angles with respect to the local target normal , and the determination of the outcomes of the collisions ( sticking , rebound or fragmentation ) as well as parameters determining the effects during the collisions .",
    "these encompass , among others , projectile and fragment sizes , depths of intrusion , crater depths , and fragment velocities .",
    "the variable parameters in the experiment are the projectile velocity , the impact angle , the physical agglomerate properties ( see table [ targetprojectiles ] ) and the projectile mass .",
    "[ experimentalparametersa ] gives an overview of the projectile masses , the impact velocities and the impact angles for the three agglomerate compositions described in table [ targetprojectiles ] and impacts into unprocessed targets .",
    "for a better statistical representation , the impact angle @xmath51 ( relative to the target normal ) is replaced by the squared sine of the above - defined angle , @xmath52 , so that each @xmath52-interval has the same statistical probability for random collisions .",
    "the original projectiles had sizes of typically 1 mm and , thus , masses of @xmath53 kg . during the release of these projectiles , a small fraction of their mass fragmented off and in most cases also hit the target .",
    "this means that we could observe , in addition to the original projectiles , several collisions between projectiles of sub - mm sizes and the target agglomerates .",
    "the lower limit of agglomerate masses of @xmath54 kg is due to the finite resolution of the cameras ( see above ) .",
    "the target masses are in the range @xmath55 g so that @xmath56 for all impacts .",
    "thus , our impact experiments are valid for all target masses @xmath57 and are not restricted to target sizes of centimeters .",
    "impact velocities ranged from @xmath58 to @xmath59 , with a slight systematic increase in velocity with increasing projectile mass .",
    "this effect  with a typical difference in impact velocity between the largest and the smallest projectiles of @xmath60  is due to some residual friction of the travelling projectiles with the rarefied - gas atmosphere of @xmath61 pa pressure .",

    "these data were collected in a drop - tower campaign comprising 9 flights in april 2006 . due to the morphology of the target surface ( see fig . [ targetprojectiles ] ) , the variation of the impact angle is irrelevant so that all impacts were carried out normal to the target surface .",
    "for dust aggregates consisting of irregular @xmath32 and diamond particles the sticking probability in the mass  velocity  impact angle range is very close to unity ( see fig .",

[ experimentalparametersa ] ) and non - sticking collision events ( full circles in fig .",
    "[ experimentalparametersa ] ) in the parameter space is not random .",
    "it is evident that the non - sticking collisions into the flat targets occur preferentially for intermediate velocities of @xmath64 , for larger impact angles , and for more massive projectiles .",
    "a determination of the sticking probability as a function of projectile mass and the components of the impact velocity normal and tangential to the target surface is shown in fig .",
    "[ stickingprobability ] .",
    "sticking probabilities were derived by sliding averaging over 13 data points sorted in projectile mass and normal / tangential impact velocity . from figs .",
    "[ experimentalparametersa ] and [ stickingprobability ] it is clearly visible that ( 1 ) the sticking probability is @xmath65 for aggregates with @xmath66 kg and falls steadily to values @xmath67 for the highest aggregate masses of @xmath68 kg , ( 2 ) for both , very low ( @xmath69 ) and very high ( @xmath70 ) normal impact velocities , the sticking probability is @xmath71 ( however , mind that projectile velocity and mass are not independent parameters and that the slowest impact velocities stem from the smallest projectiles ) , whereas the sticking probability drops to @xmath67 for normal impact velocities in the range @xmath72 , ( 3 ) the sticking probability decreases steadily for increasing tangential impact velocity and reaches values as low as @xmath73 for the highest tangential velocities of @xmath74 .    for the `` molded '' and slightly compressed targets ,",
    "sticking is even the exception ( see fig .",
    "[ experimentalparametersc ] ) , while for the flat and fluffy targets most collisions result in mass gain of the target .",
    "we find a sticking probability of @xmath75 when the target is slightly compacted and has local radii of curvature comparable to the projectile radii .",
    "it was observed that the projectiles stuck to the target only when they accidentally hit a `` valley '' .",

    "thus , this and the following subsections will mainly deal with the analysis of the non - sticking collisions of agglomerates consisting of spherical , monodisperse @xmath32 particles into flat soft targets of the same material .",
    "[ masstransferimage ] displays an example of a collision in which the impinging agglomerate bounced off after the collision . from the comparison between the first and the last image of the sequence ( see inset ) it is evident that the size of the projectile agglomerate changed .",

    "in addition to the depth of intrusion , we also derived for the non - sticking events the crater depths .",
    "this was either done by a determination of the shadow lengths inside the craters for oblique illumination or by a measurement of the length of the escaping projectile agglomerate . the crater depth",
    "is then approximated by the difference of the length of the escaping projectile ( which is , due to the mass transfer between target and projectile , larger than before the impact ; see sect .",

    "[ experimentalparametersc ] , the sticking probability is considerably reduced by the surface sculpting . only 5 out of 25 projectiles stuck to the target , and sticking",
    "was apparently restricted to those cases in which the projectile hit a `` valley '' on the target .",
    "in contrast to that , the fragmentation efficiency , while negligible for impacts into smooth flat targets , increases to 24% ( 6 projectiles ) . however , most of the projectiles ( 14 ) were semi - elastically rebounding after the impact , which makes the rebound probability with 56% the most likely single collisional outcome for the impacts into `` molded '' targets .",
    "it is clear from these experiments that , besides impact velocity , impact angle , aggregate mass and aggregate packing density , the local radius of curvature and , thus , the collisional history of protoplanetary dust aggregates plays an important role for the outcome of mutual collisions .",
    "from the results presented in the previous section , we can derive some fundamental ( although approximate and preliminary ) dynamical properties of high - porosity dust aggregates .",
    "if we assume for simplicity that the aggregates are fully elastic during collisions , we can use the well - known hertzian equation of motion @xcite for the collision between a spherical particle of radius @xmath5 and mass @xmath4 and an infinitely large sphere @xmath130 with @xmath131 being the elasticity parameter , defined by @xmath132 for like materials . here , @xmath133 and @xmath134 are the modulus of elasticity and poisson number of the materials , respectively .",

    "the slightly increasing values of @xmath155 towards larger impact energies is probably caused by the compaction of the aggregate volume during impact .",
    "for the minimum impact energy for which intrusion was found ( see above ) , @xmath114 , a minimum dynamic pressure of @xmath164 pa is required to cause the formation of a crater and , thus , compaction of the agglomerate material in the contact zone between projectile and target agglomerate .",
    "this pressure is very close to the minimum stress under which the material yields ( see fig . 4 in paper i ) .    with this data",
    ", we can also explain the mass transfer observed in many non - sticking collisions ( see sect .",
    "[ sectmasstrans ] and figs .",
    "[ masstransferimage ] and [ masstransferhistogram ] ) . during the impact , the projectile and part of the target volume",
    "are slightly compacted .",
    "as was shown in paper i , aggregate compaction increases the tensile strength of the material .",
    "thus , the compacted parts in the collisional volume have higher inner cohesion so that they are more likely to keep sticking together after the impact .",
    "we performed oblique impact experiments of typically 0.2 - 3 mm diameter projectile agglomerates into 2.5 cm diameter target agglomerates of identical composition .",
    "we used three different particle types ( monodisperse spherical @xmath32 with 1.5 @xmath165 diameter , irregular diamond with 1 - 2 @xmath33 diameter , irregular @xmath32 with 0.1 - 10 @xmath33 diameter ) and produced agglomerates by the random ballistic deposition process @xcite . depending on the particle type ,",
    "the agglomerates had volume filling factors of @xmath35 ( for monodisperse @xmath115 ) , @xmath166 ( for diamond ) , and @xmath36 ( for irregular @xmath32 ) , respectively .",
    "impact velocities ranged between 0.1 and 3 m / s .    from the results of our experimental investigation presented in the previous sections",
    ", we can draw the following conclusions :    1 .   for a similar distribution of projectile masses , impact velocities and impact angles",
    ", the volume filling factor ( porosity ) of projectile and target has a considerable influence on the collisional outcome . whereas very porous dust aggregates ( @xmath167 ) almost always stick , the sticking probability decreases with increasing filling factor for @xmath168 ( figs .",
    "[ experimentalparametersa ] - [ stickingprobability ] ) .",
    "2 .   for dust aggregates with volume filling factors @xmath169 , projectiles with diameters",
    "@xmath170 mm do only stick in near - central collisions , while near - grazing impacts lead to a rebound of the projectile ( see fig .",
    "[ experimentalparametersa ] ) .",
    "the reason for the mass dependence of the sticking behavior is the interplay between the energy of the bouncing aggregates ( which is , due to an almost mass - independent coefficient of restitution ( see fig .",
    "[ coefficientofrestitutionfig ] ) , proportional to the aggregate mass ) and the contact energy ( which is roughly proportional to the aggregates cross section ) . for small aggregates , the inertial energy of the rebounding aggregates is not capable of breaking the contacts , whereas large aggregates easily bounce off . for large aggregates ,",
    "central collisions lead to a deeper penetration of the projectile aggregate into the target and thus to a larger contact area with stronger binding forces .",
    "collisions which do not lead to sticking between projectile and target agglomerate result , on average , in a mass transfer from the larger to the smaller collision partner , i.e. to a mass loss of the target agglomerate ( see figs . [ masstransferimage ] and [ masstransferhistogram ] ) . this can be explained by an impact compaction of material comprising the projectile and part of the target and a resulting higher cohesion ( tensile strength ) of the compacted material .",
    "4 .   in the case of non - sticking ,",
    "most of the kinetic energy of the projectile is dissipated in the collision .",
    "the residual energies of the bouncing projectiles ( including the mass - transfer effect ) are very small for near - central collisions and increase with increasing impact angle up to a few ten percent of the pre - collision energy ( see fig .",
    "[ energyloss ] ) .",
    "the tensile strength of the agglomerates made of irregular @xmath32 particles , as estimated in one experiment in which the projectile almost rebound after a collision ( see fig .",
    "[ semielasticrebound ] ) , @xmath171 pa , is in good agreement with the static measurements ( see table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "the tensile strength is responsible for aggregate cohesion and sticking upon impact .",
    "6 .   if we identify the compressive strength of the agglomerates made of spherical @xmath32 particles with the estimated dynamic impact pressure ( see eq .",
    "[ impactpressure ] and fig .",
    "[ pressureenergy ] ) , we see that the compressive strength increases with impact energy , as was already indicated by the static measurements in paper i. for impact velocities @xmath172 and projectile sizes @xmath31 mm , we get a maximum compressive strength of @xmath173 pa .",
    "7 .   above a threshold value for the impact energy , @xmath174 j , a crater is formed .",
    "the crater volume scales with the normal component of the impact energy as @xmath175 . the corresponding dynamical pressure",
    ", @xmath176 is only weakly dependent on impact energy , @xmath177 and ranges from @xmath160 pa to @xmath161 pa in our experiments .",
    "the threshold value for crater formation of @xmath178 pa corresponds well with the onset of compaction measured by @xcite and paper i. the largest crater volumes were found for the highest impact energies close to the transition between sticking and non - sticking .",
    "these crater volumes ( see fig . [ cvenergy ] ) are typically @xmath179 , comparison with the masses of the largest ( and , thus , most energetic ) projectile agglomerates and the projectile densities ( see data in table [ table1 ] ) show that the corresponding projectile volumes are also @xmath180 .",
    "thus , the amount of compaction of the target and projectile agglomerates in these cases is not negligible . from @xcite we can see that at a compression of @xmath181 pa , the volume filling factor increases from @xmath35 to @xmath182 .",
    "if these static compaction measurements are transferrable to the dynamic problem , we conclude that a volume at least as large as twice the projectile s is compressed to @xmath183 of its previous volume filling factor .",
    "impact fragmentation was only rarely observed for impacts into flat and high - porosity targets .",
    "when the target surface was artificially roughened with a local radius of curvature of 1 mm ( which resulted in a slight compaction of the target agglomerate to @xmath184 ) , the sticking probability was considerably reduced , and bouncing and fragmentation were the dominating processes .",
    "earlier experiments by @xcite also found impact fragmentation when two similar - sized dust aggregates collide at velocities of a few m / s .",
    "thus , the local radius of curvature of two colliding dust aggregates plays a dominating role in the outcome of the collision .",
    "in paper i , we have shown that macroscopic protoplanetary dust aggregates are expected to be very porous . depending on the collisional history and the size of the aggregates , we expect the dusty objects to have volume filling factors between @xmath185 ( for all objects whose collision velocities never exceeded @xmath186 , i.e. for sizes @xmath187 cm ) and @xmath188 ( for all objects with sizes @xmath170 m ) . in this paper , we confirmed that collisions among fluffy protoplanetary dust aggregates with velocities @xmath186 lead to impact pressures of @xmath189 pa and , thus , to a moderate increase in volume filling factor .",
    "collisions between ( sub-)mm - sized dust aggregates and cm- to dm - sized fluffy objects are very abundant in the solar nebula and the impact velocities range around @xmath190 @xcite .",
    "thus , our microgravity experiments match the solar - nebula conditions very closely and are directly applicable to growth models .",
    "we find that the sub - mm sized dust aggregates always stick to much larger target aggregates , independent of impact velocity and impact angle .",
    "the larger , mm - sized aggregates , however , behave differently . sticking is restricted to the higher velocities and to the smaller impact angles .",
    "this trend was found for dust aggregates consisting of monodisperse spherical particles , for quasi - monodisperse irregular particles as well as for irregular monomer particles with a wide size distribution , although quantitative differences in the sticking probabilities exist .",
    "thus , for random impacts in the solar nebula , the sticking probability in collisions between mm - sized dust aggregates and cm - dm sized dusty bodies is below unity .",
    "moreover , non - sticking ( and even fragmentation ) is favored when the local radius of curvature at the point of impact of the larger body is similar to the projectile radius .",
    "this can be the case for collisions between similar - size dust aggregates or between projectiles and targets with irregular , non - flat surface textures .",
    "another interesting feature we found in our experiments is that non - sticking impacts ( i.e. those with higher impact angles ) lead to a mass transfer from the larger to the smaller body .    as a consequence , future growth models for protoplanetary dust should take into account that the outcome of a single collision between dust aggregate a and dust aggregate b is not only dependent on the size of a and b and the mutual collision velocity , but is also influenced by the collisional history ( e.g. the distribution of local radii of curvature on the surfaces of a and b ; compaction ) and the ( random ) impact angle of the particular collision .",
    "in addition to that , due to the possible occurrence of mass transfer from a larger body a to a smaller body b ( in bouncing collisions ) or fragmentation of the smaller object b ( e.g. when it hits a surface part of a with a small local radius of curvature ) , the numerical description of the collisional outcome ( and its use in e.g. smoluchowski s growth equation ) becomes rather complex .    from our experimental findings ,",
    "we consider it rather unlikely that protoplanetary bodies can grow beyond dm - sizes in a direct and simple hit - and - stick manner .",
    "although our experiments suggest that small projectiles stick at higher velocities than large projectiles , this trend does not imply that km - sized bodies can form by the accumulation of very small dust aggregates or single particles .",
    "recent experiments by schrpler & blum ( unpublished ) show that at impact velocities @xmath191 dust aggregates can not grow by the accumulation of single grains ( and , therefore , also not by the accumulation of small dust aggregates ) .",
    "however , m - sized bodies in protoplanetary disks possess relative velocities with respect to small grains of the order of @xmath192 @xcite .",
    "moreover , experiments by @xcite suggest that impacts between dusty projectiles into fluffy dusty targets around @xmath193 never lead to an accumulation of mass on the larger body but lead to strong fragmentation of the projectile and cratering ( i.e. mass loss ) of the target . a possible way out of this dilemma could be the indirect effect of projectile or fragment capturing by aerodynamic @xcite or electrostatic @xcite forces or by gravitational collapse in locally overdense regions in the midplane of protoplanetary disks @xcite .",
