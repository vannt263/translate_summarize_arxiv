    "<S> we finally investigate the effects of thermal noise on the efficiency of quantum teleportation . </S>",
    "<S> to this aim , a convenient framework is to describe noisy entangled resources as linear superpositions of non - gaussian state and thermal states . </S>",
    "<S> although the presence of the thermal component strongly reduces the teleportation fidelity , noisy non - gaussian states remain preferred resources when compared to noisy twin - beam gaussian states .        in recent years </S>",
    "<S> , much effort has been dedicated to the theoretical investigation and experimental production of highly nonclassical , non - gaussian states of the radiation field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such states are endowed with enhanced nonclassical properties , such as entanglement and negative quasi - probability phase - space distribution , that can be useful for improving the efficiency of quantum information and communication protocols @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , a general , rigorous result states that , at fixed covariance matrix , some of these desirable properties are minimized by gaussian states , which can then be considered as extremal `` benchmark '' or lowest - threshold states for quantum information applications @xcite . therefore , at least in principle , the exploitation of non - gaussian states and non - gaussianity allows to quantitatively improve the performance of several quantum information protocols . for instance , non - gaussian cloners of coherent states turn out to be optimal with respect to gaussian ones , exhibiting an enhanced single - clone fidelity @xcite . concerning quantum teleportation with continuous variables ( cv ) , the success probability of cv teleportation can be greatly increased by using entangled non - gaussian resources ,  degaussified  through conditional measurements , consisting of photon - subtraction @xcite . in particular , as shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the implementation of simultaneous phase matched multiphoton processes and conditional measurements can be used to introduce a general class of two - mode non - gaussian entangled states , in the form of squeezed bell - like states depending on an extra free , experimentally adjustable parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the optimization on this additional free parameter allows a remarkable increase of the teleportation fidelity for several relevant input states , compared both to gaussian and other degaussified resources @xcite . from the point of view of quantum state engineering , </S>",
    "<S> several schemes for the generation of non - gaussian states have been proposed @xcite , and some of them , based on photon addition or subtraction , have been experimentally implemented to obtain photon - added and photon - subtracted single - mode states from gaussian inputs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , very advanced experimental realizations have been reported @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> first , enhancement of entanglement and production of states with negative two - mode wigner function have been successfully obtained via photon subtraction of a single delocalized photon from an initial two - mode gaussian state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the photon - addition / subtraction operations , performed on a thermal light field , have also led to the demonstration of the commutation relation rules , one of the constitutive relations of quantum mechanics @xcite . moreover , using homodyne detection and fock - state resources , the experimental generation of large squeezed schrdinger cat states has been achieved @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these optical cat - like states are of particular importance because they are strongly resilient against decoherence @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + in the present work , we aim to extend the results obtained in ref </S>",
    "<S> .  @xcite by generalizing the class of squeezed bell - like states and by proposing an alternative class of non - gaussian superposition states , and by showing that these two classes of entangled non - gaussian resources allow for the optimization of cv quantum teleportation . specifically , we investigate cv teleportation with two different classes of two - mode entangled resources : squeezed symmetric superpositions of fock states , and squeezed cat - like states . </S>",
    "<S> these two classes share two common features : both are associated to the squeezing operator as cv generator of quantum correlations , and for a trivial choice of the parameters , both reduce to the gaussian twin beam ( twb ) . </S>",
    "<S> the last part of the work will be dedicated to the investigation of the effects of the presence of thermal noise on the performance of two - mode non - gaussian states used as resources for quantum teleportation . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , we will consider the non - gaussian resources obtained by superimposing squeezed bell - like states or squeezed cat - like states and two - mode thermal states . </S>",
    "<S> non - gaussian states and thermal states are assumed to be independently generated , and overlap in a common spatial volume @xcite . due to the thermal contribution , the ensuing mixed states and their correlation properties are modified by the presence of thermal photons . </S>",
    "<S> we limit the discussion to the situation of ideal teleportation protocol , i.e. ideal bell measurements and decoherence - free propagation in communication channels . </S>",
    "<S> detailed analysis in the instance of the most general realistic situation , including various sources of noise , will be discussed elsewhere . + the paper is organized as follows . in section [ secsqueeztrunctwb ] </S>",
    "<S> , we briefly recall the mathematical machinery needed for the description of the ideal braunstein - kimble cv teleportation protocol in the characteristic function formalism . </S>",
    "<S> next , we introduce the class of squeezed symmetric superposition of fock states , and apply to them the optimization procedure defined in ref .  @xcite . in section [ secsquezcatlike ] </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce the class od squeezed cat - like states , we apply the optimization procedure , and we compare results with those obtained in the previous section . in section [ secnongaussmixed ] we will analyze the effect of noise on the performance of non - gaussian resources for cv teleportation . </S>",
    "<S> finally , in section [ conclusions ] we will draw our conclusions and discuss some perspectives for future research . </S>"
