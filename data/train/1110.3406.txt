    "special attention is paid to the restoration of symmetries broken in mean field approaches @xcite , for example using projection techniques .",
    "an alternative way is to develop a theory in which the trial wave functions preserve certain symmetries . in particular , this can be achieved by multiconfiguration methods widely used in various applications , including atomic , molecular , and condensed matter physics .",
    "when the interaction is known , this kind of approach provides a very accurate description of a system . in a previous work @xcite , we proposed in the nuclear physics context a variational approach based on multiparticle - multihole ( @xmath5 ) proton and neutron configuration mixings that uses the two - body finite - range density - dependent gogny interaction in a fully microscopic way .",
    "as a first step , the method was applied in a particular case : pairing correlations ( proton - proton and neutron - neutron ) were investigated for the ground states of several even - even tin isotopes . a pioneering work using the skyrme siii interaction for the mean field part and a schematic contact interaction for the residual part has been directed to the description of @xmath6-isomers in the @xmath7hf mass region @xcite .",

    "as practical calculations inevitably require some truncation of the orbital space and order of excitation , the @xmath5 method proposes a promising scheme that allows one to predict the energies of low - lying states in a very accurate way .",
    "the possible use of statistical properties of highly excited states , which display generic signatures of quantum chaos close to random matrix theory , drastically reduces the sizes of the explicit diagonalizations . in the literature ,",

    "<S> a multiconfiguration microscopic method has been applied with the gogny effective interaction to the calculation of low - lying positive - parity states in even - even @xmath0si isotopes . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of the study is to compare the results of this approach with those of a standard method of gcm type and to get insight into the predictive power of multiconfiguration methods employed with effective nucleon - nucleon force taylored to mean - field calculations . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the multiconfiguration approach leads to an excellent description of the low - lying spectroscopy of @xmath1si , @xmath2si and @xmath3si , but gives a systematic energy shift in @xmath4si . </S>",
    "<S> a careful analysis of this phenomenon shows that this discrepancy originates from too large proton - neutron matrix elements supplied by the gogny interaction at the level of the approximate resolution of the multiparticle - multihole configuration mixing method done in the present study . </S>",
    "<S> these proton - neutron matrix elements enter in the definition of both single - particle orbital energies and coupling matrix elements . </S>",
    "<S> finally , a statistical analysis of highly excited configurations in @xmath2si is performed , revealing exponential convergence in agreement with previous work in the context of the shell model approach . </S>",
    "<S> this latter result provides strong arguments towards an implicit treatment of highly excited configurations . </S>"
