    "the lit method is suited for _ ab initio _ studies of few ( many ) body dynamics in the framework of non relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "the inputs are the nuclear potential and the excitation operator relevant to the reaction .",
    "even if the reaction brings the system to a continuum state one does not need to calculate continuum wave functions .",
    "what the method allows to calculate are matrix elements ( or combinations of them ) to continuum states , which is what one needs in order to evaluate cross sections .",
    "essential to the method are solutions of the schrdinger equation for the ground state and of a schrdinger - like equation with a source . in both cases",
    "the solutions have bound - state asyntotic conditions .",
    "so in order to apply the lit method one only needs a `` good '' technique for bound state calculations .",
    "the lit method applies both to inclusive reactions and to exclusive ones . in a traditional approach",
    "the former case is considered more complicated , because of the necessity to know solutions for all the disintegration channels .",
    "however , it turns out that the application of the lit method is more straightforward in this case than in an exclusive reaction .",
    "the lit method has been benchmarked in 2- and 3-body systems where continuum states can be calculated directly @xcite    the procedure of the lit method , though similar in spirit , is different for inclusive and exclusive reactions . in the following",
    "i will list the main steps one has to take in the two cases .      for inclusive e.m .",
    "reactions one needs to know the so called response function @xmath0 where @xmath1 represents the energy transferred by the elctromagnetic probe , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are ground state wave function and energy of the system undergoing the reaction , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are all the eigenstates and eigenvalues of the hamiltonian @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the operator relevant to the reaction . in order to calculate @xmath8",
    "one proceeds in three steps .",
    "_ the first step consists in solving for many @xmath9 and fixed @xmath10 the following equation @xmath11 the values of the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 are chosen in relation to the physical problem .",
    "for example , if one wants to calculate the cross section in a range of energies from 0 to 100 mev one solves that equation with @xmath1210 mev for about 100 @xmath9 values chosen in a range slightly larger than 100 mev , e.g. @xmath13 mev .",
    "as it will be clear below the value of @xmath10 is related to the kind of resolution one wishes to have in order to to resolve the expected structures of the response function and the values of @xmath9 scan the region of interest .",
    "_ step 2 . _",
    "the second step consists in calculating the overlaps @xmath14 of the solutions . of",
    "course these overlaps depend on @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "a theorem based on the closure property of the hamiltonian eigenstates ensures that this dependence can be expressed as @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the lorentzian function centered at @xmath9 and with @xmath10 as width . therefore if one solves eq .",
    "( 1 ) one can easily obtain the lorentz integral transform of the response function .",
    "_ step 3 . _",
    "the third step consists in the inversion of this transform in order to obtain the response function .      for exclusive reactions",
    "the lit method is applied @xcite to calculate the relevant transition matrix element @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the wave function in the continuum at energy e. as already said , in this case , the procedure requires more steps .    _",
    "_ the first step is identical to the case of inclusive reactions i.e. one has to solve eq.(1 ) . now",
    "the choice of the parameters is dictated by different criteria .",
    "i will comment on this after describing the last step .",
    "_ there is a second schrdinger like equation with source to be solved for exclusive reactions .",
    "for example , in the case of a 2-body break - up reaction this is @xmath19 where v is the potential acting between the particles belonging to the two different fragments .",
    "_ step 3 . _",
    "the third step consists in calculating the overlap @xmath20 .",
    "again , for a theorem based on the closure property of the hamiltonian eigenstates , this overlap is connected via a lit to the important function @xmath21",
    "@xcite @xmath22 as it will be clear in step 5 this function is what one needs to calculate the matrix element of interest .",
    "_ in order to obtain f(e ) one has to invert the previous lorentz transform and proceed to the final step .",
    "_ it is easy to show @xcite that the matrix element of interest is connected to the function @xmath21 via the following integral    @xmath23    this equation suggests the physical criteria one has to follow in the choice of the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 entering eqs.(1 ) and ( 4 ) . since the reaction matrix element is taking its major contribution from @xmath24 at @xmath25 a good knowledge of @xmath24 is needed around the @xmath26 value .",
    "this means that its lorentz transform needs to be known in a large enough range around that value and for small enough width in order to obtain an accurate function when inverting it .",
    "important remarks regarding the solutions of eqs.(1 ) and ( 4 ) and about the inversion of the lit will be done in the next section .      at this point",
    "it should be clear that the main points of the lit method lay in eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 4 ) .",
    "one can easily show that the solution of these equations is unique .",
    "moreover a very important point is that , due to the presence of a complex energy and sources which asyntotically vanish the solutions are limited i.e. of bound state type ( this is certainly the case for all physical e.m .",
    "operators and for the nuclear potential v in eq.(4 ) ; for long range potentials a different procedure is requred @xcite ) .",
    "this has the very important consequence that one only needs bound state techniques ( notice that also the ground state is an input of eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 4 ) ) in order to solve the problem of calculating a reaction in the continuum , even when many complicated channels are opened , like for inclusive cases above the thresholds .",
    "an other remark concerns the inversion of the transforms .",
    "due to the bell shaped form of the kernel , the inversions turn out to be rather stable . of course for any inversion technique one can use ( we use the regularization method @xcite ) one has to check that the same result for different choices of @xmath9 sets and values of @xmath10 is obtained .    in the following",
    "i will present results which have been obtained using the correlated hyperspherical harmonics ( chh @xcite ) and the effective interaction in the hyperspherical harmonics expansions ( eihh @xcite ) techniques to solve the bound sate problems and both semirealistic ( mti - iii @xcite and av4 @xcite ) and realistic ( av18+uix @xcite ) potentials .",
    "i start showing results for the 3-body systems @xcite . in fig .",
    "1a the longitudinal responses of @xmath27h and @xmath27he are shown .",
    "the effect of the 3-body force is visible in the quasi elastic ( q.e . ) peak .",
    "while the 3-body potential seems to be necessary for a better agreement with data in the case of @xmath27he , it brings the curves farer from them in the tritium case . the comparison with data at higher momentum transfers @xmath28 is of the same quality @xcite .",
    "1b shows the situation at lower energies .",
    "the discrepancy at the highest @xmath28 is worsened by considering the 3-body interaction .",
    "more precise data would be needed to study 3-body force effects .",
    "an interesting effect is shown in fig . 2 where the frame dependence of the results is shown . performing the calculation in the laboratory system , ( where the total momentum of the initial state is at rest ) or in the anti - laboratory one ( where the total momentum of the final state is at rest ) or in the breit frame ( where the total momenta of the initial and final states are equal to @xmath29 ) brings to a visible shift of the q.e .",
    "peak at higher momenta .",
    "this shows the limits of the non realtivistic calculation .",
    "data seem to agree better with the results obtained in the breit frame .    in table",
    "1 results for the longitudinal 2-body electrodisintegration of @xmath30he are shown @xcite for the kinematics of ref.@xcite represented in the ( @xmath31 ) plane and labelled by arabic numbers in fig 3 .",
    "the different effects of proper antisymmetization ( as ) and of the interaction in the final state ( fsi ) , neglected in the direct knock - out plane wave approximation ( pwia ) , are shown . in general",
    "one notices small effects of the antisymmetrization for almost all cases , as one would expect in parallel kinematics .",
    "nevertheless for the kinematics at lower energies these effects can increase up to about 10% .",
    "the role of fsi is much more important , especially at low @xmath28 .",
    "it seems to decrease considerably at @xmath28 beyond 500 mev / c .",
    "all these results have been obtained with the semirealistic mti - iii potential ( more details can be found in the poster contribution to this conference @xcite ) .",
    "results for the 4-body system with av18+uix potential have been obtained in the inclusive case ( total photodisintegration ) and are also shown as poster contribution to this conference @xcite          .results for the longitudinal 2-body electrodisintegration response function @xmath32 of @xmath30he . in the first 3 columns the kinematical values of momentum @xmath28 , energy transfer @xmath1 and missing momentum @xmath33 from ref .",
    "the as and fsi effects are shown as percentages of the pwia values [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in fig .",
    "4a results for the total photodisintegration of the 6-body systems are shown @xcite .",
    "the unretarded electric dipole operator is used .",
    "a very interesting feature i.e. the appearance of two resonances in the case of @xmath34he is worth to be noticed .",
    "they likely correspond to the soft mode due to theoscillation of the two halo neutrons against the alpha - core and to the classical giant resonance mode of protons against neutrons , respectively .",
    "since the latter requires the break - up of the alpha core the resonance appears at higher energy .",
    "one finds a unique resonance in @xmath34li , though also in this case one would expect two , due to the probable clusterized form of this nucleus . an explanation for the disappearence of the dip between the two resonances might be that in this case an additional mode i.e. the @xmath27h-@xmath27he oscillation is filling the gap .",
    "an analogous @xmath27h-@xmath27he mode in @xmath34he would not be excited by the dipole operator .",
    "new accurate 2-body break up data of @xmath34li would be needed to confirm this hypothesis .        finally in fig .",
    "4b it is shown how the lit method presently allows to calculate an inclusive reaction involving 7 particles fully _",
    "ab initio_. this result for the total photoabsorption of @xmath35li is commented in more detail in another contribution to this conference @xcite    2 efros v.d .",
