    "furthermore , these emission processes will dominate the dynamics of plasmas generated by next generation 10pw lasers @xcite . in 10pw laser - plasma interactions the qed emission processes and the plasma physics processes are strongly coupled .",
    "the resulting plasma is best defined as a ` qed - plasma ' , partially analogous to those thought to exist in extreme astrophysical environments such as the magnetospheres of pulsars & active black holes @xcite .",
    "it is therefore highly desirable that gamma - ray photon emission and pair production be included in laser - plasma simulation codes . in this paper",
    "we will describe how these processes may be simulated using a monte - carlo algorithm @xcite and how this algorithm can be coupled to a particle - in - cell ( pic ) code @xcite , allowing self - consistent simulations of qed - plasmas .",
    "several pic codes have been modified to include a classical description of gamma - ray emission and the resulting radiation reaction @xcite .",
    "the neglect of quantum effects limits the range of validity of such codes .",

    "in fact this regime has recently been reached in similar experiments where an energetic electron beam , produced by a particle accelerator , interacts with strong crystalline fields @xcitew@xmath1 @xcite ; ( 2 ) laser wakefield acceleration produced 100mev electrons which were collided with a pulse of @xmath21w@xmath1 @xcite .",

    "where the electron beam is externally accelerated and then collided with a laser pulse , the plasma processes which cause the acceleration and the gamma - ray & pair emission during the collision are decoupled and may be considered separately . the same is true of recent laser - solid experiments where photon and pair production occur in the electric fields of the nuclei of high - z materials far from the laser focus @xcite .",
    "by contrast , in laser - solid interactions at intensities expected to be reached by next - generation 10pw lasers ( @xmath22w@xmath1 @xcite ) @xmath23 and @xmath24 and so the laser pulse itself can accelerate electrons to high enough energies to reach @xmath14 . in this case",
    "the emission & plasma processes both occur in the plasma generated at the laser focus .",
    "the rates of the qed emission processes for a given electron in the plasma depend on the local electromagnetic fields and the electron s energy , which are determined by the plasma physics processes .",

    "we will describe a monte - carlo algorithm for calculating the emission of gamma - ray photons and pairs in strong laser fields .",
    "in addition to being more widely applicable than a classical description of the emission , this quantum description of emission in terms of discrete particles is more suited to coupling to a particle - in - cell code . we will detail how this coupling can be achieved so as to self - consistently model the feedback between the plasma and emission processes ; we will refer to the coupled code as ` qed - pic ' for brevity .",

    "the emission model breaks down when the fields can no longer be considered as quasi - static or when the laser s electric field becomes close to the schwinger field .",
    "the former condition is typically only satisfied in situations where emission is unimportant and the latter requires laser pulses of extremely high intensity ( @xmath180w@xmath1 ) unlikely to be reached in the near term .",
    "we therefore conclude that the emission model outlined here is applicable to a very wide range of laser intensities .",
    "finally , we note that processes not included in the model might be important under special conditions .",
    "for example , when the rate of pair production is very small , it is dominated by the second - order ( in @xmath181 ) trident process .",
    "a comprehensive discussion of higher order processes can be found in ref . @xcite .",
    "also , in addition to the coulomb collisions between electrons and ions in the plasma usually included in pic simulations , additional collisional processes could play role . for example one",
    "could include collisions between : gamma - ray photons and electrons / positrons ( compton scattering ) ; electrons and positrons ( annihilation ) ; electrons / positrons and ions / atoms ( bremsstrahlung or trident pair production in the electric fields of the nuclei ) ; gamma - ray photons and atoms ( bethe - heitler pair production ) .",
    "a full investigation of the relative importance of these effects is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "when laser pulses of intensity @xmath0w@xmath1 interact with ultra - relativistic electrons a significant amount of the electron s energy is converted to gamma - ray photons & pairs .",
    "we have shown that a probabilistic monte - carlo algorithm best simulates the emission and that such an algorithm can be coupled to a pic code to simulate qed - plasmas .",
    "by contrast a deterministic treatment of the emission processes only correctly describes the evolution of the particle spectra when pair production can be neglected and so is only valid over a relatively narrow range of laser intensities .",
    "we therefore conclude that qed - pic codes , using the monte - carlo emission algorithm described here , will provide a valuable tool for simulating high intensity laser - plasma interactions at today s highest intensities and beyond .",
