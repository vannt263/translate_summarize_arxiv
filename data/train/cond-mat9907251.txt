    "recently both superconducting and normal - state tunneling characteristics of junctions intrinsically formed in crystals of extremely anisotropic high-@xmath3 materials such as bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 ( bi-2212 ) and tl@xmath0ba@xmath0ca@xmath0cu@xmath4o@xmath5 ( tl-2223 ) have attracted much research attention .",
    "@xcite previous experimental investigations by many groups have revealed that the superconducting order parameter in the crystals is periodically modulated along the @xmath6-axis and the interlayer coupling at low - enough temperatures has a josephson nature .",
    "existence of such naturally formed intrinsic josephson junctions has been directly confirmed by @xmath6-axis tunneling measurements , using small - sized stacks or mesa structures on the surface of single crystals , including current - voltage ( @xmath7 ) characteristics,@xcite temperature or magnetic - field dependence of the critical current,@xcite dynamics of josephson vortices,@xcite microwave responses,@xcite and the josephson microwave emission.@xcite    electron tunneling spectroscopy has been conceived as one of the most powerful means to determine superconducting gap and its anisotropy.@xcite compared to other spectroscopic techniques,@xcite electron tunneling spectroscopy has a very high energy resolution of the electronic structure near the fermi level @xmath8 .",
    "tunneling spectroscopy and its interpretation on high-@xmath3 materials using conventional techniques such as scanning tunneling spectroscopy , however , have often been controversial , due to problems of poor surface characterizations mainly arising from an extremely short coherence length and uncertainty in the transverse momentum direction of the particles upon tunneling via a small tip.@xcite these problems have been conveniently circumvented by a tunneling study using intrinsic junctions ( ijs ) in high-@xmath3 materials .",
    "especially , tunneling measurements on a small - sized stack , including only a few intrinsic junctions , provide valuable information on the nature of the inherent superconducting gap and the pairing mechanism of unusual symmetry in the materials .",
    "it is unsettled yet , however , whether the individual junctions in a stack behave independently or are correlated with each other .",
    "junctions in a stack could be inductively coupled by supercurrents flowing on thin conducting planes@xcite or coupled by charging of thin conducting planes by tenneling electrons.@xcite thus the plasma oscillations excited in a stack of intrinsic junctions , for example , show collective modes.@xcite however , some previous studies indicate the opposite may be true . for dc bias current",
    "applied along the @xmath6-axis , coupling between adjacent junctions is small enough so that each junction can be assumed to be independent.@xcite correlated junction behavior would affect the usefulness of a stack for device applications .",
    "for instance , correlated junction behavior is useful for high - frequency oscillator applications but detrimental to voltage standards applications.@xcite thus , the issue of correlation of the tunneling characteristics of intrinsic junctions still remains of prime concern from both academic and device - application points of view .",
    "tunneling spectroscopy on the surface of high-@xmath3 materials is widely used to probe the nature of order - parameter symmetry , mostly using hybrid junctions consisting of conventional and high-@xmath3 superconducting electrodes.@xcite in this case , it is utterly important to make sure that the superconducting properties of the surface layer , such as the transition temperature , the gap value , and its order - parameter symmetry , do not deviate from those of inherent bulk properties.@xcite recently , surface - sensitive spectroscopy such as anlge - resolved photoemission spectroscopy,@xcite scanning tunneling spectroscopy,@xcite break - junction tunneling,@xcite and intrinsic - junction tunneling,@xcite is increasingly used to investigate the in - plane normal - state conducting state of high-@xmath3 materials _",
    "i.e. _ , the existence and nature of the pseudogap , especially as varying the doping level . since the size of the pseudogap",
    "is known to be sensitive to the doping level in the underdoped regime,@xcite any possible significant oxygen deficiency in the surface layer would lead to a very serious misinterpretation of the intrinsic bulk properties of the conducting planes . additionally , our previous study@xcite indicates that depositing noble - metal film such as au on the surface of high-@xmath3 materials , often used for surface protection for electron conduction measurements , causes a suppression of the surface layer s superconductivity by its proximity contact to normal metal . in this respect",
    ", it is of prime importance to probe any variation in the doping level of the surface layer from that of the inner layers with intrinsic bulk properties .",
    "most studies on the intrinsic tunneling effect in high-@xmath3 superconductors , both in superconducting and normal states , have been done to date by fabricating a small elevated stack structure ( with the cross - sectional area usually of a few hundreds @xmath9m@xmath10 ) on the surface of single crystals with a few ijs in it .",
    "the number of the junctions in a stack is varied by changing the height of the stack during the fabrication process using ion - beam etching or chemical wet etching .",
    "in this way , however , accurate tailoring of the number of junctions is a difficult task . to get deeper understanding of the interlayer coupling characteristics of an individual intrinsic junction as well as the conducting properties in a plane , both in superconducting and normal states , careful in - situ control of the number of ijs in a stack",
    "is required while monitoring their tunneling characteristics.@xcite    in this report , we first examine the possibility of any significant variation of the doping level in the surface layer of high-@xmath3 single crystals in contact with normal metals , along with a change in the superconducting properties .",
    "we then discuss the physical implication of the scaling of tunneling resistance and the @xmath7 curves with respect to surface junction resistance .",
    "we also examine whether the main feature of a junction is influenced by the presence of other junctions in a stack . to that end , we focus on the evolution of the tunneling characteristics of ijs while progressively increasing the number of junctions in a stack fabricated on the surface of bi-2212 single crystals .",
    "ion - beam etching was used in combination with in - situ cryogenic measurements , similar to the technique reported in ref . .",
    "the number of ijs in a stack was increased in sequence by carefully controlling the low - energy ion - beam etching time with preformed metallic electrodes on the surface of the stack . between each etching stage",
    "the @xmath6-axis tunneling @xmath7 characteristics and the temperature dependence of the @xmath6-axis tunneling resistance @xmath11 were taken while varying the substrate temperature from room temperature down to @xmath12 k.    this study directly confirms our previous finding that a weak junction ( wj ) forms at the surface of a bi-2212 stack@xcite which is in contact with a normal - metal electrode .",
    "the in - situ etching / measurements technique confirms that the suppression of the gap and the transition temperature in the surface layer of a stack does not result from the change in the doping level or from the proximity - induced weak superconductivity in the bi - o layer@xcite which may be surfaced .",
    "rather , the suppression results presumably from the proximity contact of the surface layer with @xmath13 symmetry to the au normal metal .",
    "this study also convincingly demonstrates that the individual junction is little influenced by the presence of other junctions in a stack in a low bias region . as to the cause of development of negative dynamic resistance in the high - bias region of the @xmath7 curves with increasing number of junctions in a stack , we find that the joule heating effect , not the nonequilibrium , can be a good candidate for that cause .",
    "bi-2212 crystals were grown from a melt using alumina crucibles , details of which are described elsewhere.@xcite pieces of single - crystal platelets with typical size @xmath14 mm@xmath15 were selected from a mass of the cooled melt .",
    "a platelet was glued onto a sapphire substrate by negative photoresist , then hard - baked .",
    "an optically smooth surface was prepared by cleaving a platelet of single crystal using scotch tape .",
    "right after cleaving , 1000- - thick au film was deposited on the surface of the bi-2212 crystals to protect the surface from any contamination during stack - fabrication processes .",
    "we then patterned a large ` base mesa ' of size @xmath16m@xmath15 on the crystal surface , using standard photolithography and ar - ion - beam etching , with beam voltage and current density @xmath17 = 300 v and @xmath18 = 0.8 ma / cm@xmath10 , respectively .",
    "any residue of burned - out photoresist on the crystal surface was stripped off by oxygen - plasma etching .",
    "then a patterned layer of photoresist was placed around the base mesa and hard - baked to insulate the region , excluding the top surface of the base mesa .",
    "a thick au film ( @xmath2 8000  ) was deposited,@xcite and connection pads from the base mesa were patterned and ion - beam etched .",
    "thereafter , the electric pads of au ( totally @xmath2 9000  ) crossing the base mesa acted as masks for the small stacks in the further in - situ etching process . in this stage ,",
    "a thin ( less than 300 @xmath20 in nominal thickness ) au film was intentionally left on the top surface of the base mesa between the pads to prevent the inadvertent premature formation of small stack structures .",
    "the remaining au film would be removed during the next in - situ measurement process with controlled ion - beam etching .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the optical photograph of a specimen after completing the whole processes prior to the in - situ etching .    for in - situ monitoring of the tunneling characteristics of a small stack ,",
    "the specimen was loaded into an ultra - high - vacuum chamber equipped with a liquid - helium cooling pot as well as an ion - beam etching system .",
    "ion - beam etching and cryogenic measurements could be repeated without breaking the vacuum .",
    "the remnant 300- - thick au film and bi-2212 crystal underneath were further etched , while forming four small stacks on the base mesa .",
    "the junction size was defined by the width ( @xmath21 @xmath9 m ) of the base mesa and ( @xmath22 @xmath9 m ) of the electrical pads overlaid perpendicularly to the length of the base mesa . in this etching stage",
    "we used sufficiently low ion - beam voltage ( @xmath17 = 100 v ) and current density ( @xmath18 = 0.16 ma / cm@xmath10 ) to enhance the controllability of the etching rate .",
    "the height of a small stack was controlled by the total etching time @xmath23 . in every 1 - 2 min etching ,",
    "the chamber was pumped out and a stack was characterized in a three - probe - measurement configuration [ see the inset in fig .",
    "the @xmath24 was measured using a dc method with a constant bias current of 10 @xmath9a . to reduce the effect of external noise",
    ", low - pass filters were connected to the voltage and the current leads .",
    "a recent report@xcite indicates that , using the similar cleaving technique on bi-2212 crystals , step structures with a height of one half unit cell usually forms in the samples in an area of 30 @xmath25 30 @xmath9m@xmath10 .",
    "we did not observe any evidence for the existence of a step in our tunneling results . in this study , we took measurements for three different stacks , all showing similar features .",
    "we present a typical set of data obtained from one of the specimens .",
    "progressive evolution of @xmath24 by increasing the in - situ etching time @xmath23 up to 30 min is presented in fig .",
    "increment of the number of junctions in the stack with increasing @xmath23 was monitored by counting the number of quasiparticle branches in the corresponding @xmath7 curves .",
    "2(a ) reveals that when we lower the temperature from room temperature down to the bulk superconducting transition temperature , the @xmath11 curves show metallic behavior at @xmath26 min but gains a slightly semiconducting behavior at @xmath27 min where the value of @xmath28 reaches a maximum at @xmath29 ( @xmath30 92 k ) .",
    "the value of @xmath28 then starts dropping abruptly and reaches a minimum at @xmath3 ( @xmath30 86.5 k ) .",
    "interestingly , for all the values of @xmath23 , @xmath28 remains finite below @xmath3 and gradually increases again up to the secondary resistance maximum at @xmath31 . in the range of @xmath32",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath28 shows a more pronounced semiconducting behavior . below @xmath31",
    "the value of @xmath28 drops sharply , especially for high values of @xmath23 ; and vanishes to 0.1 @xmath33 at @xmath34 ( @xmath30 15 k ) and below .    as @xmath23 increases",
    ", @xmath35 decreases from @xmath2 36 k to @xmath2 17 k , as denoted by the dotted guideline in fig .",
    "all other characteristic temperatures , @xmath29 , @xmath3 , and @xmath36 , however , remain almost insensitive to the etching time . the transition width @xmath37 ( @xmath30 0.3@xmath25.0 k ) near @xmath36 gets sharper with increasing @xmath23 , while @xmath38 ( @xmath30 2.3 k ) near @xmath3 remains unchanged .",
    "the behavior of @xmath11 near @xmath35 is not only sensitive to @xmath23 , but is also highly affected by the ambient condition .",
    "for instance , the peak value of @xmath39 increases rapidly and @xmath36 is suppressed significantly for rf irradiation of power level as low as @xmath40 dbm ( not shown ) . @xmath11 near @xmath35",
    "is so sensitive to the rf noise that the data taken without filters are greatly affected .    for the sake of clarity we divide the temperature range into three regions : region i ( @xmath41 ) , ii ( @xmath42 ) , and",
    "iii ( @xmath43 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "the total number of quasiparticle branches obtained from the @xmath7 curves in region i for the corresponding etching times are @xmath44 ( @xmath23=6.5 min ) , 4 ( 8 min ) , 5 ( 10 min ) , 5 ( 12 min ) , 6 ( 15 min ) , 8 ( 19 min ) , 9 ( 22 min ) , 10 ( 26 min ) , and 12 ( 30 min ) .",
    "the finite value of @xmath28 found in the stack in region ii is known to be always present in a three - terminal measurement.@xcite since the ijs in the stack below @xmath3 should be in zero - resistance state for a low bias current , the finite @xmath28 at temperatures in region ii in this three - terminal configuration is attributed to the @xmath45 weak junction ( wj ) consisting of the topmost cu - o bilayer in the normal state , and the adjacent inner cu - o bilayer in the superconducting state.@xcite in other words , the surface cu - o bilayer underneath the normal - metal electrode has a suppressed transition temperature , which is essentially @xmath35 .",
    "below @xmath36 , the surface junction also becomes josephson coupled and the junction resistance subtracts from the value of @xmath28 for a low current bias.@xcite in this region , @xmath28 is then essentially the contact resistance between the surface cu - o bilayer and the au electrode and its value reduces to as small as 0.1 @xmath33 ( not shown in detail in the figure ) , which is at least two orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath28 in other temperature ranges",
    ". we can thus consider @xmath46 as the junction resistance of the surface junction .",
    "we can summarize the above discussion in terms of the tunneling configuration of the stack and the corresponding @xmath6-axis resistance in the following way .",
    "in region i , the stack has au / d@xmath47ididid ..... configuration , where d ( d@xmath47 ) denotes the ( suppressed ) superconducting layer with @xmath48 symmetry .",
    "@xmath28 in this case is essentially the contact resistance @xmath49 between au electrode and d@xmath47 layer ; @xmath50 . in region",

    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) we note that @xmath65 and the value increases gradually with increasing @xmath23 .",
    "the values of @xmath46 in fig .",

    "we presume the variation of @xmath46 is due to shrinking of the junction area as the etching gets longer , the reason for which will be discussed below .",
    "to study the intrinsic properties of the interlayer coupling or the conduction in the cu - o planes , one needs to eliminate the effect of the variation in the junction area by normalizing @xmath11 with respect to the junction resistance . rescaled curve @xmath66 for each set of curves in fig .",
    "2(a ) corresponding to @xmath23 equal to 10 min or longer tends to merge into a single curve at temperatures in region ii [ see fig .",
    "the temperature dependence of the curve is well in accordance with @xmath53 expressed in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "note that in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) only @xmath54 has @xmath23 dependence , thus @xmath67 or equivalently @xmath66 as plotted in fig .",

    "any larger @xmath74-wave gap @xmath73 would result in even a poorer fit over the range of region ii .",
    "insensitivity of the rescaled @xmath11 to the number of ijs in a stack in region ii indicates that the variation of @xmath11 , at least for @xmath76 min , was caused by the variation in the junction area with etching .",
    "note that this insensitivity also implies the number of the n@xmath77id junctions does not change with progressive etching ; only one n@xmath77id junction exists presumably on the surface of the stack .",
    "the deviation of @xmath11 from the merging curve for @xmath78 min is due to incomplete formation of the stack and will be discussed below .",
    "one notices in fig .",
    "2(b ) that the curves @xmath66 do not show any merging behavior in region iii , even for long etching times @xmath79 min .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the @xmath11 in region iii include the tunneling resistances of both number of inner ijs and the surface wj , which are scaled by @xmath80 and @xmath54 [ @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "thus , @xmath11 in region iii is not scaled by @xmath46 alone .",

    "3 shows more details of @xmath11 curves in region iii for @xmath82 , 19 , 22 , 26 , and 30 min corresponding to @xmath83 , 8 , 9 , 10 , and 12 , respectively .",
    "each curve shows a pronounced metallic behavior in the high - temperature region , which may imply that the conducting planes are in a highly @xmath84 regime,@xcite gradually turning into a semiconducting behavior around @xmath85 k with lowering temperatures .",
    "increasing @xmath23 tends to increase @xmath11 in proportion as more ijs are included in the stack . in fig .",
    "3 we plot the single junction contribution to the tunneling resistivity @xmath86 as converted from the relation@xcite @xmath87/j$ ] using the geometric parameters , the junction area @xmath88m@xmath10 and its thickness @xmath89  , for the number of junctions @xmath90 , 9 , 12 , 12 and @xmath91 , 6 , 8 , 6 , respectively .",
    "thus , the curves correspond to averaging @xmath6-axis resistivity over 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 junctions , respectively . since @xmath46 as seen in fig .",
    "2(a ) is stabilized for @xmath92 min , not much relative error is assumed to be involved in this conversion .",
    "note that the surface wj contribution is subtracted from @xmath86 and it contains only the inner ij contribution .",
    "one noticeable feature of @xmath86 is that the linear-@xmath93 behavior is significantly diminished in the temperature range of @xmath94 k , which implies that the linear-@xmath93 behavior in the inset of fig .",
    "3 arises mainly from the surface wj .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath86 for different etching stages merge well into a single curve .",
    "the dotted curve shows the least @xmath95 fit of the data to the empirical relation @xmath96 as adopted in ref .",
    "anticipating the occurrence of a pseudogap above @xmath3 , with the best fit parameters of @xmath97cmk , @xmath98 k , @xmath99cm / k , and @xmath100 cm . the parameter values , especially the value of @xmath101 , in comparison with fig . 4 of ref .",
    "indicate that , although the linear-@xmath93 dependence is much reduced , the inner stacks are still in a overdoped regime",
    ". the surface layer , at least with au protection on it , _ can not be less doped _ than the inner layers .",
    "thus , the suppressed superconductivity in the surface layer should be attributed to other causes rather than its oxygen loss .",
    "the plausible cause is the effect of the proximity contact of the surface layer with the normal - metal ( au ) electrode , as proposed previously.@xcite      figure 4 shows the evolution of the quasiparticle branches in the tunneling @xmath7 curves below @xmath36 as the stack forms with increasing etching time @xmath23 . for @xmath23",
    "shorter than 5 min , the @xmath7 curves show anomalous splitting of quasiparticle branches . in the case of @xmath102 min as in the inset of fig .",
    "4(a ) , for example , increasing the bias current causes a sudden drop of voltage to the lower - voltage branch near @xmath103 mv , instead of a jump to the next higher - voltage branch as usually observed in a high-@xmath3 stack.@xcite when the direction of the bias change is reversed , voltage jumps around @xmath104 mv to a neighboring higher - voltage branch .",
    "this anomalous branch splitting may have been caused by any remnant au deposit which was not completely removed from the surface of the base mesa during the initial stage of the stack formation .",
    "the remnant deposit appeared to persist for etching up to 5 min and partially short the surface cu - o bilayer .",
    "we believe that the positive temperature coefficient in the @xmath11 curves above @xmath3 as well as the deviation of the curves from the single merging curve in region ii for @xmath26 min as seen in fig .",
    "2(b ) was caused by this incomplete formation of a stack .    in fig .",
    "4(a ) , for @xmath105 min , one sees four branches develop . as the bias current is increased voltage jumps to an adjacent higher - voltage branch at the critical current of each branch . development of this more normal behavior of a stack indicates that the regular stack structure started forming at @xmath105 min . even in this case , the critical current @xmath106 ( or the return current @xmath107 ) for each branch is much different from each other . the @xmath7 curve for 8-min etching shows similar behavior , while the critical current in each branch reduced rapidly ( not shown here ) . the significant discrepancy in @xmath106 ( or @xmath107 )",
    "most likely resulted from the differences in the junction area for a series of ijs near the bottom of a stack due to inhomogeneous etching around the boundary of a stack .",
    "the irregularity in the values of @xmath106 and @xmath107 appearing in the high - bias range in the initial etching stages is seen to continuously reduce , and both of the quantities approach stable values of their own in the low - bias range as @xmath23 increases [ see figs .",
    "4(b)-(f ) ] .",
    "this behavior implies that the branches with the irregular @xmath106 and @xmath107 correspond to incompletely developed junctions near the bottom of the stack .",
    "when the etching time is increased beyond 10 min , at least a few low - bias branches in the @xmath7 curves start showing almost the same critical currents ( @xmath108 ma ) and return currents ( @xmath109a ) .",
    "thus , a few small stacks are believed to develop fully for @xmath76 min .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with what we discussed in relation with the @xmath11 curves .    if we consider the stack as a @xmath6-axis one - dimensional array of the underdamped josephson junctions,@xcite the mccumber parameter@xcite @xmath110 deduced from the ratio@xcite @xmath111 is about 1600 , which is about two or three times larger than the results of others , @xmath112 , @xmath113 ( ref . ) or @xmath114 ( refs . ) .",
    "this difference may arise from a high critical current density @xmath115 a / cm@xmath10 of our sample .",
    "one should note that the first quasiparticle branch in the @xmath7 curves in three - probe measurements comes from the d@xmath77id surface wj .",
    "the magnified view of the first branch in a very low - bias range in the inset of fig .",
    "4(b ) shows a hysteretic behavior with a much smaller critical current @xmath116a and return current @xmath117a .    the negative dynamic resistance or the  back - bending \" for a set of longer etching times in figs .",
    "4(d)-(f ) is a generic feature in the @xmath7 characteristics of stacked tunneling josephson junctions.@xcite either a nonequilibrium quasiparticle distribution in ultrathin conducting layer@xcite or a joule heating effect@xcite has been proposed to explain the feature .",
    "4 clearly demonstrates that the back - bending develops gradually as the number of ijs in the same stack increases , attributing it to a high - bias effect . in fig .",
    "5 we replotted the high - bias branches showing the back - bending behavior for the different number of junctions in the stack .",
    "the back - bending feature is visible , even from the early stages of etching ( @xmath118 min corresponding to @xmath83 ) , and becomes more pronounced for longer etching . remarkable feature in this figure is that the voltage - turning points lie well on the 3 mw power - dissipation line .",
    "although no symptom of temperature change was detected in the thermometry , this strongly suggests that joule heating could be a likely cause of the back - bending effect .",
    "careful examination of fig .",
    "5 reveals that as @xmath23 increases a certain quasiparticle branch for a constant current bias shift to higher voltage range .",
    "this is opposite to what one would expect from the nonequilibrium quasiparticle distribution or from the joule heating effect .",
    "we infer that it arises from the increase in the junction resistance @xmath54 and @xmath80 due to shrinking of the junction area with increasing @xmath23 .    in figure 6 , we replotted the first low - bias branch of @xmath7 curve for @xmath119 min which was already shown in fig",
    ". 4(a ) and the first three low - bias branches of 6 sets of @xmath7 curves corresponding to the etching times from 10 min to 30 min .",
    "we also plotted the anomalous branches of @xmath7 curves for @xmath120 and 5 min . to eliminate the variation of the junction resistance with @xmath23 ,",
    "the current axis in each @xmath7 curve was rescaled by multiplying @xmath46 obtained from fig .",
    "one first notices that in this rescaled plot , with increasing @xmath23 up to 6.5 min , the over - all distribution of branches gradually shifts to higher voltages , and the first branch of @xmath105 min almost coincides with the first stable branch for @xmath121 min or longer .",
    "the sequence of the branch development indicates that the first stable branch arises from the surface wj in d@xmath77id configuration , and the second and third branches from the inner ijs , both in did configuration .",
    "if we assume that the d@xmath77id ( did ) junction has the same junction resistance @xmath54 ( @xmath80 ) as the n@xmath77id ( nin ) junction , we can rewrite the @xmath7 relation for the wj and ijs as follows .",

    "( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) predict that each @xmath7 curve of the wj or the ij will show its own scaling behavior with respect to different junction resistances @xmath54 and @xmath80 , depending only on the energy gap @xmath124 and @xmath59 .",
    "the remarkable feature in fig .",
    "6 is that , when scaled by @xmath46 all together , all the three branches , for significantly different etching times longer than 10 min , fall into three merging curves .",
    "this confirms a definite proportionality existing between @xmath54 and @xmath80 , regardless of the etching time @xmath23 .",
    "the point will become clearer in the discussion in relation with fig .",
    "7(a ) below .",
    "we now determine the value of the zero - temperature energy gap in the surface layer , @xmath125 , by fitting the first stable branch to eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) , while adopting @xmath126 mev which was already obtained from the fit of @xmath127 in fig .",
    "2(b ) and setting @xmath54 to be @xmath46 obtained from fig .",
    "the best fit value@xcite is @xmath128 mev assuming the bcs temperature dependence of gap energy with @xmath70 .",
    "this value of the surface gap is about one - half of the intrinsic gap value for any number of fully developed junctions . from the best fit of the second or the third branch to eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) , we obtain @xmath129 for @xmath130 min , which is about one sixth of @xmath54(30 min)@xmath131(@xmath3 ; 30 min ) .",
    "it yields the characteristic voltage @xmath132 mv , which is much smaller than @xmath133 mv predicted by the ambegaokar - baratoff relation@xcite in conventional superconductors or the theoretical prediction @xmath134 for @xmath135 symmetry.@xcite the value @xmath136 corresponds to @xmath137 cm , which is close to the value of @xmath138 cm of ijs in the high - temperature region ( see fig .",
    "thus the enhanced @xmath28 above @xmath80 around @xmath29 is believed to be the quasiparticle contribution discussed in ref . .",
    "since junctions in a stack switch to the higher resistive state before reaching the gap edge of a junction , there are uncertainties in determining both the normal - state resistance @xmath80 and the critical current @xmath106 directly from the data . as pointed out in ref .",
    ", in a fit to eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) the values of @xmath80 and @xmath73 are interrelated .",
    "for instance , one gets smaller fit value of @xmath80 for the choice of larger @xmath73 .",
    "we eliminated this uncertainty by adopting the measured values of @xmath46 for @xmath54 , and alternatively determined @xmath73 , @xmath125 , and @xmath80 , respectively , from the normalized @xmath11 curves in region ii and @xmath7 curves in region i. this process is possible only for repeated progressive measurements in a single piece of crystal with the same material parameters @xmath125 and @xmath73 through the entire measurements .",
    "the consistency of the above fits are further ascertained by cross - checking the etching time dependence of the junction parameters obtained by different methods . in fig .",
    "7(a ) we plot @xmath80 determined from a fit of the second branch to eq.([eq5 ] ) for different etching times of @xmath139 min .",
    "we also plotted @xmath46 obtained directly from fig .",
    "2(a ) for different @xmath23 .",
    "although showing a large difference in the absolute values for a given @xmath23 , the two data sets obtained by different ways , when normalized by the values at @xmath130 min , @xmath112 , @xmath140 ; 30 min ) @xmath141(30 min)@xmath142 and @xmath143 min@xmath144 , show an excellent agreement with one another for all the ranges of @xmath23 values .",
    "this fact makes it clearer that a definite proportionality exists between @xmath54 and @xmath80 in any stack - forming etching stages .",
    "the value of @xmath46 starts increasing for @xmath145 min and becomes fully stabilized for @xmath23 around 19 min .",
    "the minimal etching time required for the full development of the stack can also be examined from the @xmath23 dependence of the critical currents@xcite @xmath146 of the wj and @xmath106 of ijs as shown in fig .",
    "the critical currents were taken from the first ( @xmath146 ) and the second ( @xmath106 ) quasiparticle branches of the @xmath7 curves in fig .",
    "both values of @xmath146 and @xmath106 are stabilized for @xmath23 around @xmath147 min .",
    "in this study , we focused on the evolution of the tunneling characteristics for stacks containing a few intrinsic junctions , for temperatures above and below the bulk superconducting transition temperature of bi-2212 single crystals .",
    "three - probe measurements in comparison with usual four - probe measurements provided an advantage of enabling us to investigate the nature of the surface junction with suppressed coupling strength as well as the conducting properties of the inner junctions . compared with previous attempt by others,@xcite",
    "we were capable of lowering temperatures even below the josephson coupling temperature @xmath36 of the surface junction using liquid - helium cooling .",
    "our study reveals that @xmath11 curves are scaled by the junction resistance of the surface wj below @xmath3 . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath7 charcteristics for both ijs and the wj in stable etching stage for @xmath27 min are scaled by the junction resistance of wj , which indicates that a definite proportionality exists between the values of junction resistances of the wj and ijs .",
    "one of the main findings of this study is that the gap in the surface layer @xmath125 is much reduced from the bulk value of ijs , while the junction resistance of the surface wj ( @xmath54 ) is much larger than that of the ijs ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "we obtained @xmath80 from a fit to the second @xmath7 branch as shown in fig .",
    "6 . mentioned earlier , in a fit to eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) an almost similar fit quality can be achieved by choosing different values for interrelated parameters @xmath80 and @xmath73 . instead of",
    "obtaining @xmath54 from @xmath46 , just setting @xmath54 to be @xmath80 , for example , may be a reasonable choice . with this choice",
    ", however , the fit gives @xmath148 , @xmath112 , the surface layer has a gap about three times larger than the inner layers .",
    "recently it has been claimed that , in the underdoped regime , the gap @xmath125 has a larger value@xcite even for lower transition temperature @xmath36 .",
    "thus it may seem plausible to expect widening of the gap at the surface layer while @xmath36 is suppressed .",
    "however , the universal relation between the superconducting gap and the transition temperature in ref . indicates that the magnitude of the gap for @xmath149 k is at best @xmath150 , which is far smaller than @xmath151 obtained from the fit above .",
    "in addition , it has also been known that the suppression of the transition temperature of bi-2212 material itself down to @xmath152 k can not be achieved with a high degree of oxygen deficiency , because a band with bi - o antibonding near the fermi level acts as a source of holes.@xcite the picture that the surface layer is more underdoped than the inner layers is again contradictory to the behavior revealed in fig .",
    "3 , where the opposite was concluded earlier . in this sense , we discard the picture of an increased gap with suppressed transition temperature at the surface layer , and cling to the original results of fit with a suppressed surface gap . in this case , however , we must provide an explanation for the concurrent reduction of @xmath36 and @xmath125 in the surface layer , which is apparently in contradiction to the known relation@xcite between the two variables . the only way to eliminate",
    "the inconsistency is to assume that the concurrent suppression of @xmath125 and @xmath36 of the surface layer is not caused by the change in the doping level in it , but by its proximity contact to the au normal electrode as supposed by us in ref . .",
    "recently , manabe @xmath153 @xmath154 observed that , in scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements on bi-2212 , the gap becomes smaller as the tip approaches closer to the crystal surface.@xcite we believe this is consistent with our claim of the proximity - induced suppression of the gap on the surface layer in our specimen .",
    "although currently no theory is available to allow any quantitative confirmation of our claim , this study apparently strengthens our previous arguments .",
    "recently there have been tunneling spectroscopic studies on the nature of order - parameter symmetry of ybco-123 and bi-2212 superconducting materials by employing high-@xmath3 superconductor / normal metal / conventional @xmath74-wave superconductor hybrid junctions.@xcite studies have reported the existence of significant and finite @xmath74-wave components for ybco-123 and bi-2212 superconducting materials , respectively .",
    "our study indicates that in tunneling spectroscopy using the above - mentioned hybrid junctions one should be concerned about the change in the superconducting state at the crystal surface , not by the oxygen deficiency as one might easily assume , but by the contact of @xmath135-wave surface layers with a normal layer in a junction . on the other hand ,",
    "stm tunneling spectroscopy may be more affected by the oxygen deficiency at the surface .",
    "the variation of the junction area along with continuous etching , in fact , acts as a disadvantage in studying the inherent tunneling properties in the system .",
    "ironically , however , this can be advantageous as in this study , because as illustrated both in fig . 2 and in fig .",
    "6 , we were able to be convinced that , once the data are normalized by proper area - dependent parameters like junction resistance , the junctions in any etching stage exhibit no discernible variation in their properties , regardless of the number of junctions contained .",
    "this leads us to the conclusion that not much correlation effect is present among the ijs .",
    "material parameters such as @xmath125 and @xmath73 do not change in the whole in - situ etching / measurements process , which thus gives stronger conviction of the scaling behavior in our @xmath11 and @xmath7 data as discussed above .",
    "the in - situ technique is also extremely useful to study the so - called back - bending effect .",
    "it convinces one that the effect develops by increasing the number of junctions contained in a single piece of crystal , which in turn allows us to draw a power - dissipation line .",
    "comparing the back - bending feature in the @xmath7 branches from different crystals in terms of power dissipation would be less meaningful .",
    "this technique is expected to provide powerful means to examine both the interlayer coupling properties in the superconducting state and the in - plane conducting nature in the normal state .",
