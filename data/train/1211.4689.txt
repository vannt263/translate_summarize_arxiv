    "the discovery of several new classes of isolated neutron stars , namely the anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and soft gamma - ray - burst repeaters ( sgrs ) , the x - ray dim isolated neutron stars ( xdins ) , the compact central objects in certain supernova remnants ( ccos ) , and the rotating radio transients ( rrats ) , has brought into focus the question of possible evolutionary links ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the existence of radio pulsars with large inferred dipole magnetic moments , close to , and in fact partly overlapping with , the range of magnetar fields inferred for axps and sgrs ( @xmath3 10@xmath4 g ) , and the observation of radio pulses from some axps and sgrs , further highlight the possibility of links and raise questions about the similarities and differences among these sources .",
    "the locations and evolutionary tracks of pulsars in the @xmath5 diagram hold the keys to deciphering the links .",
    "the recent measurement of the peculiar braking index @xmath6 of psr j1734@xmath03333 , the lowest among the measured braking indices of young pulsars , with period @xmath7 = 1.17 s and period derivative @xmath8 = 2.28 @xmath9 s s@xmath10 @xcite is an exciting new clue .    analysing the @xmath5 diagram of all isolated pulsars in terms of evolution by rotationally powered dipole radiation into the vacuum , starting with the initial rotation rate and the magnetic dipole moment at birth , and assuming that the dipole moment remains constant , fails to explain the distribution of all young pulsars on the @xmath5 diagram or to shed light on the possible connections of the distinct classes .",
    "evolution of the magnetic - dipole moment and its angle with the rotation axis is one direction of extending the picture , as suggested in the work reporting the braking index of psr j1734@xmath03333 @xcite .",
    "magnetic - field evolution and amplification to lead to magnetar strength @xmath11 g surface fields have been invoked to explain the bursts of sgrs and axps @xcite .",
    "this does not require that the magnetar strength fields are necessarily in the @xmath12 component that controls the spin - down of the pulsar and thereby its evolution on the @xmath5 diagram .",
    "indeed , the recently published @xmath8 upper limit of sgr 0418 + 5729 @xcite has shown that the surface dipole field of this pulsar is at most 7.5 @xmath13 g at the equator ( 1.5 @xmath14 g at the poles ) .",
    "this has been interpreted in terms of the decay of the magnetar dipole moment of this sgr @xcite .",
    "all measured braking indices @xcite deviate from the n = 3 value , characteristic for dipole radiation in vacuum .",
    "braking indices n @xmath15 3 imply a growing magnetic dipole moment ( or growth of the dipole moment component perpendicular to the rotation axis ) .",
    "thus , to understand the behavior of pulsars and magnetars in different parts of the @xmath5 diagram requires growth , or decay , of the magnetic dipole moment perpendicular to the rotation axis , at rates depending on the sources .",
    "an alternative avenue for a more general picture of isolated pulsar evolution is to allow for the possibility of interaction with matter around the star , so that the emission is not dipole radiation in vacuum .",
    "an effective possibility is that some matter left over from the supernova explosion is actually bound to the neutron star , in the form of a ` fallback ' accretion disk , as it necessarily carries angular momentum , as proposed by @xcite to explain the properties of axps .",
    "@xcite suggested that the presence or absence , and the initial mass , of a fallback disk could be the third initial condition , complementing the initial rotation rate and dipole magnetic moment , to determine the subsequent evolution of different classes of neutron stars .",
    "a first simple application of this idea to pulsar braking indices and motion across the @xmath5 diagram was presented by @xcite .",
    "discoveries of radio pulsars with long periods and large period derivatives suggested that these sources could have evolutionary links with axps and sgrs ( @xcite ; see , e.g. , @xcite for a recent review of axps and sgrs ) .    in the present paper",
    "we apply the fallback disk model in detail to the evolution of psr j1734@xmath03333 and show that the model can explain all the properties of this source , including its braking index .",
    "in section 2 we outline the model and examine evolutionary tracks for a neutron star with a fallback disk to search for scenarios leading to the present properties ( @xmath16 , and @xmath17 ) of psr j17343333 .",
    "we trace all possible initial conditions , namely the initial period , dipole field , and disk mass , that can produce the source properties .",
    "we discuss the results of our model calculations in section 3 , and summarise our conclusions in section 4 .",
    "in the fallback disk model ( fdm ) @xcite the period and luminosity evolution are determined by the interaction between the neutron star and a fallback disk around it .",
    "the mid - infrared detections from the axps 4u 0142 + 61 @xcite and 1e 2259 + 586 @xcite are consistent with the presence of fallback disks around these sources @xcite .",
    "it was shown by @xcite that the observed near - ir luminosities and the upper limits of axps / sgrs are compatible with the expectations of fdm .",
    "the values of the dipole - field strength at the pole of the neutron star , indicated by fdm fits to optical / ir data of 4u 0142 + 61 @xcite and by the results of the work explaining the long - term @xmath18 , and x - ray luminosity , @xmath17 , evolution of axps and sgrs , are less than @xmath19 g in all cases @xcite .",
    "it was proposed in these papers that the magnetar strength fields needed to power the bursts must be residing in quadrupole and higher multipole components .",
    "the higher multipole fields fall off with distance from the star more rapidly than the dipole field does , leaving the dipole field to determine the interaction with the disk and the resulting torques .",
    "the interactive evolution of the neutron star and the fallback disk can have epochs with accretion as well as radio pulsar epochs .",
    "the neutron star enters the accretion regime and experiences an efficient torque if and when the inner edge of the fallback disk penetrates into the light cylinder .",
    "the neutron star can then spin down to long periods of several seconds on timescales from @xmath20 to @xmath21 yr , depending on the disk torques , the dipole - field strength @xmath22 and the disk mass @xmath23 .",
    "the first ( ejector ) phase of evolution without accretion could last from several years to more than @xmath24 yr depending on @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and initial period @xmath25 . during this phase ,",
    "the neutron star is a radio pulsar . in the present work ,",
    "we show that psr j1734@xmath03333 is likely to be in the radio pulsar phase without accretion at present and that the accretion epoch could start at a future time . in the accretion phase , at a time depending on the initial parameters , the inner disk will reach the light cylinder and the accretion will stop . after the accretion phase , the disk could remain attached to the light cylinder and the disk torque could still remain active while its efficiency gradually decreases to the level of the dipole radiation torque . unlike a steady - state disk in a binary , where the accreting stage can be sustained on the evolutionary timescales of the binary and the companion",
    ", the fallback disk around an isolated neutron star will diminish . from the beginning ,",
    "the outermost parts of the disk are always at low temperatures .",
    "eventually , temperature even in the inner disk becomes too low to sustain viscosity .",
    "the disk then becomes passive , mass inflow and disk torques terminate .",
    "the decreasing luminosity and disk torque together lead to the observed period clustering ( see * ? ? ?",

    ", we investigate the evolution mainly in the initial radio pulsar phase .",
    "we address the peculiar braking index of psr j1734@xmath03333 , thereby exploring the effect of a possible fallback disk on the evolution of isolated radio pulsars across the @xmath26 diagram .",
    "the recent measurement of the second derivative of the period , @xmath27 = @xmath28 s s@xmath29 @xcite , provides an opportunity to test fdm evolutionary scenarios more stringently than before , checking for the first time for simultaneous agreement of @xmath27 with @xmath18 , and x - ray luminosity , @xmath17 .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of the source is @xmath30 erg s@xmath10 , taking into account the 25% error margins for the distance estimate @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that the @xmath27 of psr j1734@xmath03333 is positive .",
    "this means that the pulsar is evolving towards the upper right corner , the axp / sgr region , of the @xmath26 diagram . for an isolated neutron star evolving by magnetic - dipole radiation in vacuum",
    ", this would require a dipole field growing in time .",
    "note that the toroidal and dipole fields of axps / sgrs , starting from the early phase of evolution , should @xmath31 rather rapidly with time in the magnetar model ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the model we employ for psr j1734@xmath03333 is the same as the one we used to investigate the long term evolution of axps / sgrs in our earlier work .",
    "the details of the model are described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we start with an initially extended disk with an inner radius equal to the  radius = ( g m)^-1/7  ^4/7   ^-2/7 , where @xmath32 is the rate of mass flow arriving at the inner disk , @xmath33 is the gravitational constant , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the mass and the magnetic - dipole moment of the neutron star .",
    "when the inner disk radius @xmath36 , calculated by equation 1 , exceeds the light cylinder radius @xmath37 , we set @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "this assumes that the inner disk remains linked on the closed field lines when it can not enter the light cylinder . in this phase ,",
    "accretion is not possible , and pulsed radio emission is allowed . in the phase of spin - down with accretion , when the inner disk is inside the light cylinder and greater than the co - rotation radius ( @xmath39 ) , a fraction of the matter could be propelled from the system while the remaining fraction accretes onto the neutron star .    in the accretion phase ,",
    "we calculate the disk torque acting on the neutron star using n =  ( g m ) ^1/2   ( 1-^2 ) = i   @xcite , where @xmath40 is the moment of inertia of the neutron star .",
    "the fastness parameter is defined as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the angular frequency of the disk at @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the angular frequency of the neutron star . using equations 1 and 2",
    ", it is found that @xmath45 , independent of @xmath46 and @xmath7 when the system is not close to rotational equilibrium .",
    "this indicates that @xmath47 is constant and @xmath48 in this phase . when a high - luminosity axp / sgr is approaching ( or receding from ) rotational equilibrium @xmath27 is negative ( positive ) . in the early radio phase",
    ", the magnetic dipole radiation torque could dominate the disk torque for fast born pulsars ( @xmath49 50 ms ) for @xmath50 g. we calculate the total torque including also the magnetic dipole torque @xmath51 .    in our model calculations",
    ", we find that over the spin history of psr j1734@xmath03333 , the dipole radiation torque remains 2 - 3 orders of magnitude weaker than the disk torque for an initial period @xmath52 300 ms . for a given field strength ,",
    "the ratio of the torques depends on the chosen disk torque model and the initial period p@xmath53 .",
    "for instance , our results agree with the results of @xcite , who found that for slow - born pulsars ( with p@xmath53 @xmath54 300 ms ) the disk torque dominates for the first @xmath54 10@xmath55 years . in their model , for fast - born pulsars ( p@xmath53 @xmath54 5 ms ) , the dipole torque is the dominant mechanism for the first @xmath54 10@xmath55 years .",
    "the disk torque we employ in our model is more efficient than that used in @xcite , and depending on the disk mass , it could start to dominate the dipole torque in an earlier phase of the evolution for fast - born pulsars ( which probably represent a small set among newborn neutron stars , lying in the tail of a gaussian distribution with mean 300 ms and standard deviation 150 ms , according to the simulations of @xcite ) .",
    "the mass flow rate at the inner disk is calculated at each evolutionary step by solving the diffusion equation with an initially thin disk surface density profile ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "initially , for numerical reasons , we set the outer disk radius at @xmath56 cm .",
    "after the first time step , @xmath57 has a dynamical evolution such that the temperature at @xmath57 remains equal to @xmath58 , and beyond this radius the disk is assumed to be in a viscously inactive phase . because of decreasing irradiation flux , temperatures and @xmath57 also decrease gradually with time .",
    "the initial disk mass is found by integrating the initial surface density profile .",
    "since the position of the initial outer disk radius is not well known , our @xmath23 values may not reflect the actual full disk mass . in this phase ,",
    "we substitute @xmath38 to calculate the disk torque ( equation 2 ) . when the dipole torque is negligible , we find @xmath59 in this phase . we perform numerical calculations to follow the evolution of @xmath32 together with corresponding @xmath18 , and @xmath27 at each time step @xcite .",
    "we repeat the calculations until we identify the initial conditions that can produce the observed @xmath16 and also , in the present case , @xmath17 of psr j1734@xmath03333 simultaneously , at an age when the disk does not penetrate the light cylinder , allowing for radio pulsar activity .    in the radio pulsar phase , for a neutron star with the properties of psr",

    "the infrared emission from the disk depends on several factors , like inclination angle of the disk , irradiation efficiency , outer and inner disk radii .",
    "we will present elsewhere the expected ir emission from psr j1734@xmath03333 and sources similar to it in detail , together with a discussion of the assumed parameters .",
    "we expect that psr j1734@xmath03333 will evolve into the accretion phase within another @xmath71 yr ( see figures 1 and 2 ) . by the onset of the accretion phase , the mass - flow rate of the inner disk will have decreased to a very low level such that accretion does not significantly contribute to the total x - ray luminosity .",
    "radio pulsars following evolutionary curves similar to that of psr j1734@xmath03333 could be detected in the accretion phase if they show soft gamma - ray bursts like axps / sgrs - these would be identified as transient axps .",
    "such sources are not likely to emit radio waves , having spun down to long periods by this late stage of evolution .",
    "only if they are sufficiently close to earth we could detect and identify them as xdins .",
    "some of these sources could evolve to periods longer than the axp / sgr periods @xcite .",
    "it is hard to detect them due to low x - ray luminosities . in short ,",
    "sources like psr j1734@xmath03333 may evolve to become transient axps or xdins .",
    "the evolution of xdins and their connection with axps / sgrs will be the subject of our future work .",
