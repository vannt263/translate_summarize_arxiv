    "more information on the role of ellipsoids in convex geometry can be found in @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  3 ) .    in this article",
    "we are concerned with uniqueness results for minimal and maximal ellipsoids with respect to size functions different from the volume .",
    "the earliest contribution to this topic is @xcite who proved uniqueness of the minimal quermass integral ellipsoid among all enclosing ellipsoids with prescribed center .",
    "this result can also be deduced from more general findings of @xcite and @xcite . as to maximal inscribed ellipsoids we are only aware of @xcite who shows uniqueness with respect to a vast class of size functions that are defined with the help of an arbitrary convex body .    in this article",
    "we provide uniqueness results for minimal enclosing and maximal inscribed ellipsoids for further families of size functions .",
    "the basic ideas are similar to that of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the new results are found by applying them to diverse representations of ellipsoids with the help of symmetric matrices .    after recalling some basic concepts in section  [ sec : preliminaries ]",
    "we define the notion of a `` size function '' and , in section  [ sec : uniqueness - results ] , present several different uniqueness results . in any case",
    "it is necessary to study a particular representation of ellipsoids and properties of an `` in - between ellipsoid '' in this representation .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : non - unique ] we describe a few examples of convex bodies and size functions with non - unique extremal ellipsoids .",
    "with the help of a positive semi - definite symmetric matrix @xmath2 and a vector @xmath3 an ellipsoid can be described as @xmath4 the interior of @xmath5 is the set of all points @xmath6 that strictly fulfill the defining inequality . in this article",
    "we generally admit degenerate ellipsoids with empty interior since they may appear as maximal inscribed ellipsoids . the interior is empty if @xmath7 is only positive semi - definite and not positive definite .",
    "we call the ellipsoid _ singular _ if this is the case and _ regular _ otherwise .",
    "the vector @xmath8 is the coordinate vector of the ellipsoid center .",
    "a straight line incident with @xmath8 and in direction of an eigenvector of @xmath7 is called an ellipsoid axis , its semi - axis length @xmath9 is related to the corresponding eigenvalue @xmath10 via @xmath11 .",
    "since @xmath7 is symmetric and positive definite , there exist @xmath12 pairwise orthogonal axes with real semi - axis lengths .",
    "note that equation   is not the only possibility for describing ellipsoids . in section  [ sec : uniqueness - results ]",
    "we will encounter several alternatives but all of them use a symmetric matrix and a vector as describing parameters .",
    "there exist different notions for the `` size '' of an ellipsoid .",
    "a natural measure for the size is the ellipsoid s volume , but we may also take the surface area , a quermass integral , a norm on the vector of semi - axis lengths etc . more generally , we consider a non - negative function @xmath13 on the ordered vector of semi - axis lengths that satisfies a few basic requirements . by @xmath14",
    "we denote the set of positive , by @xmath15 the set of non - negative reals ; @xmath16 is the set of vectors @xmath17 with entries @xmath18 .",
    "a function @xmath19 is called _ size function for an ellipsoid _ if it is continuous , strictly monotone increasing in any of its arguments and symmetric , that is , @xmath20 whenever @xmath21 is a permutation of  @xmath6 .",
    "denote by @xmath22 the vector of eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix @xmath7 , arranged in ascending order .",
    "clearly , @xmath13 can be extended to the space of symmetric , positive semi - definite matrices by letting @xmath23 .",
    "sometimes we will even write @xmath24 when an ellipsoid @xmath5 is described by a symmetric matrix  @xmath7 .",
    "note that @xmath13 depends only on the eigenvalues of the symmetric matrix @xmath7 .",
    "hence , it is independent of the position and orientation of @xmath5 .",
    "the uniqueness proofs in this article all follow a certain scheme .",
    "we want to prove that there exists only one minimal enclosing ellipsoid ( with respect to a certain size function @xmath13 ) of a convex body @xmath25 . assuming existence of two minimizers @xmath26 and @xmath27 we construct an `` in - between ellipsoid '' @xmath28 that contains the common interior of @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( and hence",
    "also the set @xmath1 ) and is strictly smaller ( measured by the size function @xmath13 ) than @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "uniqueness results for maximal inscribed ellipsoids can be obtained in similar fashion .",
    "these type of proof requires the construction of an in - between ellipsoid @xmath28 that contains @xmath1 ( or is contained in @xmath1 ) and is strictly smaller ( or larger ) than @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "different constructions of @xmath28 yield different uniqueness results .      an ellipsoid may be viewed as affine image of the unit ball : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a ( not necessarily regular ) matrix and @xmath31 .",

    "`` symmetric '' means that the function @xmath13 is independent of the order of its arguments .",
    "the precise definition of `` essentially strict convexity '' is rather technical and will be omitted since we will use only a weaker version of lewis generalization",
    ".    we will apply davis convexity theorem to size functions of ellipsoids . when proving uniqueness results for minimal ellipsoids we demand strict convexity of @xmath13 on @xmath55 . for maximal inscribed ellipsoids",
    "we demand strict concavity on @xmath56 .",
    "results of @xcite then guarantee strict convexity / concavity of @xmath57 on the spaces of symmetric matrices with eigenvalues in @xmath14 , @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "[ th:1 ] let @xmath13 be a size function for ellipsoids such that @xmath58 is strictly concave on @xmath59 .",

    "there exists a unique ellipsoid that is maximal with respect to  @xmath13 .",
    "the existence of a maximal ( with respect to @xmath13 ) inscribed ellipsoid follows from the compactness of @xmath1 and the continuity of @xmath60 .",
    "this is explained in great detail in @xcite .",
    "to proof uniqueness , we assume existence of two @xmath13-maximal ellipsoids @xmath26 and @xmath27 , that is @xmath61 , both contained in @xmath1 .",
    "we compute the in - between ellipsoid @xmath28 for @xmath62 as in . by lemma  [ lem:1 ]",
    "it is contained in the convex hull of @xmath26 and @xmath27 and therefore also in @xmath1 .",
    "looking at the size of the in - between ellipsoid we find @xmath63 because @xmath45 is a symmetric matrix , we can use davis convexity theorem and find , by strict concavity of @xmath64 , @xmath65 which is a contradiction .",

    "we view an ellipsoid as the set @xmath66 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 , that is , as affine pre - image of the unit ball .",
    "again , it is no loss of generality to assume that @xmath32 is symmetric and positive semi - definite .",

    "there exists a unique ellipsoid that is minimal with respect to  @xmath13 .",
    "the existence of a minimal ( with respect to @xmath13 ) ellipsoid that encloses @xmath1 , follows from the compactness of @xmath1 and the continuity of @xmath78 ( see again @xcite ) .    to proof uniqueness ,",

    "we compute the in - between ellipsoids @xmath28 for @xmath62 , as in . by lemma  [ lem:2 ]",
    "it contains the common interior of @xmath79 and hence also @xmath1 . looking at the size of @xmath28 we find @xmath80",
    "because @xmath45 is a symmetric matrix , we can use davis convexity theorem ( see proposition  [ prop:1 ] on page  ) .",
    "it implies that @xmath81 is strictly convex .",
    "therefore we can write @xmath82 because @xmath26 and @xmath27 have the same size it follows that @xmath83 we have now that the size of @xmath28 is smaller than the size of @xmath26 and @xmath27 . together with lemma  [ lem:2 ] this constitutes a contradiction to the assumed minimality of @xmath26 and @xmath27 and finishes the proof .",
    "it is easy to see that the proves of theorems  [ th:1 ] and [ th:2 ] remain true if we replace the euclidean unit ball by an arbitrary centrally symmetric convex body , centered at the origin , and measure its size by the volume .",
    "hence , we can state a much more general result :    the volume - minimal circumscribing affine image of an arbitrary convex unit ball to a compact convex body @xmath1 is unique .",
    "the same is true for volume - maximal inscribed affine image of an arbitrary convex unit ball .",
    "the maybe most straightforward way to represent a non - degenerate ellipsoid @xmath84 uses the algebraic equation of @xmath5 : @xmath85 with a symmetric , positive definite matrix @xmath86 and @xmath3 .",

    "further let @xmath0 be a compact convex body . among all ellipsoids that contain @xmath1",
    "there exists a unique ellipsoid that is minimal with respect to  @xmath13 .",
    "an ellipsoid can also be viewed as the set of hyperplanes that intersect the ( point - set ) ellipsoid in real points .",
    "using hyperplane coordinates , this description is formally the same as in section  [ sec : equation ] : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is a symmetric , positive semi - definite matrix and @xmath97 . in homogeneous form",
