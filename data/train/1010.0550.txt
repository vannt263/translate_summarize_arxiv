    "blazars make up the majority of extragalactic sources of very high energy ( vhe ; @xmath4 ) gamma rays .",
    "they are a subset of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , and consist of bl lacertae ( bl lac ) objects and flat - spectrum radio - loud quasars . the general framework to explain",
    "the gamma ray emission is that they are produced by charged particles which are accelerated in a relativistic jet .",
    "these jets are powered by gas accretion into a central supermassive black hole and are perpendicular to the accretion disc . when the jet is directed to us , the energy and flux of gamma - rays",
    "are boosted by the relativistic beaming effect ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "generally , the spectral energy distribution of agns can be described by two broad bumps .",
    "the lower energetic bump , at frequencies from radio to x - rays , is attributed to synchrotron emission from nonthermal relativistic electrons in the jet .",
    "the other bump , covering the x - ray to gamma - ray bands , could either be due to inverse compton scattering of seed photons by the electrons ( leptonic model , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) or due to hadronic interactions ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "3c  66a was classified as a bl lac object by @xcite , based on its significant optical and x - ray variability .",
    "the synchrotron peak of this source is located between 10@xmath5 and 10@xmath6 hz @xcite , therefore 3c  66a can also be classified as an intermediate - frequency peaked bl lac object ( ibl ) .",
    "the redshift of 3c  66a was determined to be @xmath7 by independent authors @xcite .",
    "however , their measurements are based on the detection of one single line .",
    "another observation of 3c  66a at a different spectral range was reported by @xcite , but no spectral feature was found , and a lower limit of the redshift was derived to be 0.096 . for the marginally resolved host galaxy @xcite , a redshift of 0.321 was found .",
    "recently , through the investigation of the large area telescope ( lat ) , on board the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ ( _ fermi _ ) satellite and vhe gamma - ray observations , upper limits for the redshift of 3c  66a were derived ; @xmath8 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath9 confidence level ) and @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "several gamma - ray observations of 3c  66a were performed since the 1990s . with the _ egret _ satellite , a gev gamma - ray emission ( 3eg j0222 + 4253 )",
    "was associated with 3c  66a @xcite .",
    "however , due to the large _ egret _ point - spread function ( psf ) , an influence by the nearby pulsar psr j0218 + 4232 could not be excluded @xcite .",
    "the crimean astrophysical observatory claimed detections of 3c  66a above @xmath11 with an integral flux of @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "later observations by hegra and whipple reported upper limits of @xmath13 @xcite and @xmath14 @xcite , respectively .",
    "additionally , the stacee observation found a hint of signals at a 2.2 significance level and derived upper limits of @xmath15 and @xmath16 for thresholds of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively @xcite .",
    "recent veritas observations of 3c  66a taken from 2007 september to 2008 january and from 2008 september to 2008 november , for a total of 32.8 hr , resulted in a detection in vhe gamma rays @xcite .",
    "the energy spectrum was derived with a photon index of @xmath19 .",
    "the integral flux of the veritas observations above @xmath18 is ( @xmath20 ( 6  of the crab nebula flux ) .",
    "3c  66a has been monitored by _ fermi_/lat since 2008 august , covering the latter part of the veritas observation . according to @xcite , who reported the first 5.5 months of _",
    "fermi_/lat observations of 3c  66a , the blazar showed a significant flux variability ( a factor of 56 between the highest and lowest fluxes ) .",
    "the derived energy spectrum with the photon index of @xmath21 above @xmath22 , in combination with the veritas spectrum , indicates that the spectrum must soften above @xmath1 .",
    "magic observed the sky region around 3c  66a from 2007 august to december , obtaining a total exposure time after data quality cuts of 45.3 hr @xcite .",
    "these data revealed a significant vhe gamma - ray signal centered at 2^h^23^m^12^s^ , 43@xmath230@xmath247@xmath25 .",
    "this excess ( named magic  j0223 + 430 ) coincides within uncertainties with the position of a nearby , fanaroff - riley - i ( fri ) type galaxy 3c  66b ( @xmath26 ; * ? ? ?",
    "still , judging from the skyplot alone , the probability of the emission to originate from 3c  66a is 14.6 .",
    "the energy spectrum of magic  j0223 + 430 was reproduced by a single power law with the index of @xmath27 . the integral flux above @xmath28 corresponded to ( @xmath29 ( 2.2  of the crab nebula flux ) .",
    "according to @xcite , the radio galaxy is also a plausible source of vhe gamma - ray radiation .",
    "also , the recent magic detection of ic 310 @xcite , a radio galaxy at a very similar redshift ( @xmath30 ) indicates that 3c  66b might be feasible to explain all or part of the magic detection from 2007 .",
    "from mid 2009 august , 3c  66a went into an optical high state which was reported by the tuorla blazar monitoring program .",
    "this outburst triggered new magic observations .",
    "the optical flux in the @xmath31 band reached a maximum level of @xmath32@xmath33 in 2010 january , while the baseline flux in the historical data of the source is @xmath32@xmath34 .",
    "the observations were carried out with the magic telescopes located on the canary island of la palma ( 28.8  n , 17.8  w , @xmath35 ) .",
    "the two @xmath36 diameter telescopes use the atmospheric cherenkov imaging technique and allow for measurements at a threshold as low as @xmath37 in normal trigger mode .",
    "we observed the blazar 3c  66a in several time slots between 2009 september and 2010 january .",
    "however , the sky imaging ccd cameras that are used to cross - check the telescope pointing ( `` starguider cameras '' ) only became fully applicable to stereo observations in early december . to allow for a high - confidence directional statement on the arcminute scale , we therefore only used data taken after these upgrades , which were 5.6 hr in total",
    "furthermore , we had to discard data with low event rates , affected by the exceptionally bad weather conditions in that winter . finally , we had 2.3 hr of good quality data left after all quality cuts .",
    "they were taken on six days between 2009 december 5 and 2010 january 18 , partly under low - intensity moon light conditions .",
    "the data were taken using the false source tracking ( wobble ) method @xcite , in which the pointing direction alternates every 20 minutes between two positions , offset by @xmath38 in ra from the source .",
    "these wobble positions were chosen with respect to 3c  66a , but the small distance to 3c  66b ( 0.01 ) allows equal judgment for both sources .",
    "the data were taken at zenith angles between 13  and 35 .",
    "for the analysis , only stereoscopic events triggered by both magic telescopes were used .",
    "they were analyzed in the mars analysis framework @xcite , taking advantage both of the advanced single - telescope algorithms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and newly developed stereoscopic analysis routines .",
    "these routines are at present still subject to some minor improvements and will be discussed in more detail in a separate paper still in preparation , but are shortly outlined in the following .    combining monoscopic and stereoscopic strategies , the direction of gamma rays is calculated for each telescope separately , using the random forest technique @xcite , and later combined with the projected crossing point of the image axes , with a weight depending on the angle between the two shower images . requiring a certain level of agreement between the different estimates furthermore improves the resolution , and also helps to reject the ( less focused ) hadron showers .",
    "similarly , an energy estimator is determined from look - up tables for each telescope separately , and later combined to a common estimated energy .",
    "the skymap generation , which is particularly important for the analysis of data from the 3c  66a / b region , follows a two - step algorithm . the first step is to generate an exposure model for the field of view in camera coordinates , for the quality cuts that were applied in the analysis",
    "this is done by joining the distributions of photon - like events from the two wobble positions , taking advantage of the fact that the source , in relative camera coordinates , is on opposite sides for both wobble sets .",
    "the second step is the calculation of an expected background event distribution in celestial coordinates , and its comparison to the actual event distribution . before that comparison ,",
    "a smearing with a gaussian kernel is applied .",
    "the significances are calculated following equation ( 17 ) of @xcite , taking into account the higher precision of the background estimation implied by the above modeling .",
    "the performance of the analysis software was optimized and checked with contemporaneous crab nebula data and mc .",
    "the crab nebula spectrum could be analyzed down to about @xmath37 , fully covering the range of the spectrum presented in the next paragraph .",
    "the achieved angular resolution , defined as the @xmath39 of a two - dimensional gaussian function , is around 0.1  at @xmath1 and approaching 0.065  at higher energies .",
    "this @xmath39 defines the radius in which 39  of all photons of a point source are contained .",
    "the systematic uncertainty on the direction reconstruction is a product of the telescope pointing uncertainty and possible biases that occur in the reconstruction algorithms .",
    "the latter can be caused by irregularities in the shower images , such as missing camera pixels , inhomogeneous noise from stars in the field of view , or imperfections in the data acquisition electronics .",
    "both the total pointing deviation and the telescope pointing precision of magic were always monitored over the years @xcite , and along with studies of contemporary stereo data of known direction lead to an estimate of the maximal systematic stereoscopic pointing uncertainty of 0.025 .",
    "we also used the publicly accessible _",
    "fermi_/lat data to investigate the status of the source in the gev energy range during the magic observation period .",
    "the _ fermi _ data were analyzed using the public software package lat science tools v9.15.2 , including the instrument response file p6_v3_diffuse , and galactic , extragalactic and instrumental background models .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows a skymap of the observed region above @xmath1 . the significance of the excess at the location of 3c  66a is @xmath40 .",
    "we cross - checked the detection also by investigating the distribution of squared angular distances ( @xmath41 ) between photon directions and the assumed source position .",
    "the expected background is extracted from corresponding @xmath41 plots done with respect to other sky positions at similar distance from the pointing direction . comparing the data with this expectation",
    "we find a significance of @xmath42 ( see figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the difference in significance can be attributed to the different integration procedure of signal and background in the skymap , which generally leads to a slightly better background estimation and therefore a higher significance .",
    "we also analyzed the data taken with and without moon light separately to find possible effects from the higher thresholds of individual camera pixels .",
    "however , we could not find a clear tendency beyond the statistical errors and thus decided to use all the data for the analysis .",
    "unlike in the 2007 observations of this sky region , the emission peak this time is clearly on top of 3c  66a .",
    "the fitted center of gravity of the excess ( small black square in figure  [ fig1 ] ) is at a distance of @xmath43 from 3c  66a , and @xmath44 from 3c  66b . while being compatible with the former , the statistical rejection power for the emission to emerge from the radio galaxy 3c  66b corresponds to 4.6 standard deviations .",
    "even considering the unlikely case of a systematic offset exactly toward the blazar , the rejection significance of 3c  66b is at least @xmath45 .",
    "these numbers were confirmed by a second analysis with independent data quality selection and cut optimization procedures . the same result is found even when the photon direction is taken only from the projected crossing point of the two shower axes .",
    "we therefore conclude that the signal we see this time emerges from the blazar 3c  66a .",
    "it shall be mentioned that this result is a clear merit of the angular resolution and background rejection of the new stereoscopic system .",
    "in fact , if we compare the above stereo directional reconstruction algorithm to the magic - i algorithm alone , we find basically the same result , but the statistical error of the fitted source position increases roughly by a factor of two .",
    "consequently , the rejection significance of 3c  66b would be less than 2 standard deviations , and the total detection significance would be below 5 standard deviations .",
    "the energy spectrum of 3c  66a was derived using four different unfolding algorithms @xcite which correct for efficiency , smearing and biasing effects in the energy response of the detector .",
    "the most conservative of these methods is the so - called forward unfolding , in which essentially a spectral shape is assumed a priori , and its parameters are adjusted by iteratively folding the assumed spectrum with the response function until the predicted distribution of estimated energies matches optimally the actually measured distribution . with all unfolding methods",
    ", we found that the data are well compatible with a power law of the form    @xmath46    with a photon index @xmath47 and a flux constant at @xmath18 of @xmath48 .",
    "the integral flux above @xmath1 corresponds to @xmath49 ( 8.3  crab nebula flux ) . here",
    ", the parameters and statistical errors are taken from the forward unfolding , while the systematic errors reflect the variations among the other unfolding algorithms , plus several standard uncertainties discussed in @xcite .",
    "the systematic flux uncertainties add up to 36  in total .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] displays the function we fitted through forward unfolding , and spectral points derived using the tikhonov unfolding method @xcite .    due to the shortness of our observation",
    ", we can not discuss flux variability with these data .",
    "however , comparing the flux to the one from our previous observation of the 3c 66a / b region confirms the veritas report of 3c 66a being a variable source in general .",
    "we also analyzed the _ fermi _ data from the same time period .",
    "the flux variability we found in a week - to - week light curve is not significant . given the statistical uncertainties of the light curve , we would be sensitive on @xmath50 level to flux variations of 60  or greater , and conclude the variability in the days we observed must be less than that . the averaged flux above @xmath51 is roughly comparable to the averaged flux over the first 5.5 months @xcite , and lower than that seen in 2008 october , when a strong tev flare was observed by veritas . a single power - law model can reproduce the source spectrum , and the photon index is compatible with the one found in @xcite , indicating no significant change in the overall spectral shape .",
    "magic observed the 3c  66a / b region in 2009 december and 2010 january , during an optical active state of 3c  66a and detected a clear vhe gamma - ray signal .",
    "the excess coincides with the position of 3c 66a , and we rule out the emission to come from 3c  66b at a confidence level of @xmath45 .",
    "this detection does not contradict the earlier magic detection , though , which favored 3c  66b as the vhe source .",
    "on the one hand , because the observation time of 2.3 hr would be too short to detect the vhe emission of 3c  66b , if on a similar flux level as in 2007 , and on the other hand , because its flux may be even lower than before .",
    "in fact , 3c  66a might have to be in a low flux state in order not to outshine the comparably weak emission from 3c  66b at this close distance of about @xmath52 of the psf of the magic telescopes .",
    "the obtained energy spectrum is softer than in the previous magic detection ( @xmath53 ) and compatible with the veritas spectrum of 3c  66a .",
    "compared to veritas , the magic measurement has a lower threshold and the spectrum is extending to well below @xmath1 . the flux level of 8.3  crab nebula flux is similar to the one reported by veritas ( 6 ) , and significantly higher than in the previous magic observation ( 2.2 ) .",
    "the vhe photons produced at the source can be absorbed in the intergalactic space by pair production with the low energy ( uv to infrared ) photons of extragalactic background light ( ebl ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the amount of absorption depends on the energy and redshift , and can be corrected for in the data , assuming a certain modeling of the ebl density .",
    "such a de - absorbed spectrum can be regarded as the spectrum we would measure if there were no ebl . to derive a de - absorbed spectrum , we tested several state of the art ebl models , namely , @xcite , the fiducial model in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the ebl corrections were applied in the spectrum unfolding procedure ( see above ) , using the full covariance matrix to correctly calculate the errors .",
    "the spread of the differential , de - absorbed flux spectra , obtained with the four models and assuming the redshift of @xmath54 , is shown as the dark shaded area in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the de - absorbed photon indices for the four ebl modelings are listed in table  [ tbl1 ] .",
    "the differences between the de - absorbed spectra are very small , although the one corrected after @xcite is slightly harder than the others .",
    "this also reflects the fact that also the predicted ebl shapes and densities are very similar in the first three models , but the overall density in @xcite is somewhat higher .      from most vhe emission models ,",
    "the de - absorbed spectrum is expected not to be concave , i.e. , rising toward higher energies .",
    "this can be tested both by comparing the points of our own spectrum , but also by a comparison with the _ fermi _ photon index ( 1.98 ) .",
    "the fact that we find our spectrum neither significantly concave nor harder than in _ fermi _ suggests that the assumed redshift of @xmath54 does not contradict our observations .",
    "in fact , we investigated the plausibility of the redshift , assuming that the intrinsic spectrum is not expected to be exponentially rising , and thus have a pileup , at highest energies .",
    "this common method was previously used and described , for example , in @xcite . using the @xcite model and the likelihood ratio test between the `` power law '' and `` power law + pile - up '' hypotheses ,",
    "as described in the reference , we derive an upper limit on the redshift of @xmath59 .",
    "the results derived in this paper demonstrate the advantages of the magic stereoscopic system .",
    "further magic and other gamma - ray observations of this region can provide interesting information about the ibl type bl lac object 3c  66a , and , during low flux periods of that , also the fri type galaxy 3c  66b .",
