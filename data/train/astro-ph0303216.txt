    "mid - infrared spectra of some infrared luminous galaxies show a deep 10@xmath2 m silicate grain absorption feature believed to be a strong indication of a buried , compact energy source ( roche et al . 1986 ; smith , aiken , & roche 1989 ; dudley & wynn - williams 1997 ; spoon et al .",
    "the nearest of these , the @xmath7 galaxy ngc 4418 ( roche et al .",
    "1986 ) , is a nearly edge - on sa type galaxy which is likely interacting with a distorted companion galaxy 24 kpc away ( see the digitized sky survey image of the galaxy pair ) .",
    "ngc 4418 has a high infrared luminosity - to - molecular gas mass ratio ( @xmath8m[h@xmath9 \\gtrsim 100 $ ] : sanders , scoville , & soifer 1991)m(h@xmath10 and 25 , respectively ; sanders & mirabel ( 1996 ) . ] and warm infrared colors ( @xmath11 ) similar to those observed in infrared galaxies with seyfert - like emission line spectra ; the latter property has led to speculation that the dust in ngc 4418 is being heated by an imbedded agn .",
    "the optical spectrum of the galaxy has very faint h@xmath12 emission , but the forbidden lines of [ n ii ] @xmath13 6548,6583 , [ o i ] @xmath14 6300 , and [ s ii ] @xmath13 6716,6731 have not been detected , making it difficult to classify the galaxy as a seyfert , liner , or h ii region - like galaxy ( armus , heckman , & miley 1989 ) .",
    "no emission lines are detected at mid - infrared wavelengths ( spoon et al .",
    "the calculated visual extinction of @xmath1550 mag derived from the observed silicate absorption feature verifies that optical observations reveal little about the nuclear regions .",
    "as part of the larger program to image iras - luminous galaxies with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) near - infrared camera and multiobject spectrometer ( nicmos ) and the keck ii telescope with a mid - infrared camera ( mirlin ) , observations of ngc 4418 have been obtained .",
    "both instruments are ideally suited for observations of infrared galaxies : nicmos combines near - infrared technology with the excellent resolution possible with hst ( 0.11@xmath16at 1.1 @xmath2 m ) , making it possible to peer deeper into the optically obscured nuclear regions of infrared galaxies .",
    "mirlin combines mid - infrared technology with the large collecting area and spatial resolution capabilities of the keck telescope .",
    "these observations yield important insight to the environment of the central energy source of ngc 4418 , and possibly to the nature of more distant and infrared luminous galaxies with deep silicate absorption features .",
    "the nicmos portion of this dataset has been briefly discussed elsewhere ( scoville et al . 2000 ) . throughout this paper , a distance to ngc 4418 of 27.3 mpc ( e.g. ridgway , wynn - williams , & becklin 1994 ) is adopted such that 1@xmath17 subtends 130 pc at the distance of ngc 4418 .",
    "hst observations of ngc 4418 were obtained on 1997 november 27 using the nicmos camera 2 .",
    "nicmos consists of three 256@xmath18256 hgcdte arrays , each with a different pixel scale ; the pixel scale of camera 2 is @xmath19 pixel@xmath20 in the @xmath21 and @xmath22 direction , providing a @xmath23 field of view ( thompson et al . 1998 ) .",
    "images were obtained using the f110w ( 1.1 @xmath2 m ) , f160w ( 1.6 @xmath2 m ) , and f222 m ( 2.2 @xmath2 m ) filters , providing resolutions of 0.11 , 0.16 , and 0.22@xmath16 , respectively .",
    "observations were done by executing a 4-point spiral dither per filter setting . at each dither position ,",
    "non - destructive reads ( multiaccum ) were obtained , with integration times of 88 seconds ( 1.1 @xmath2 m , 1.6 @xmath2 m ) and 120 seconds ( 2.2 @xmath2 m ) per exposure .",
    "in addition to the galaxy observations , 3-point spiral dither observations of 120 seconds each were done on blank sky ( 4@xmath24 south of ngc 4418 ) using the 2.2 @xmath2 m filter . finally , dark exposures were taken using the same multiaccum sequences executed for the galaxy and sky observations .",
    "reduction of the data was done with iraf .",
    "the dark was first created , then the nicmos data were dark subtracted , flatfielded and corrected for cosmic rays using the iraf pipeline reduction routine calnica ( bushouse 1997 ) .",
    "the dithered images were then shifted and averaged using the drizzle routine in iraf ( e.g. hook & fruchter 1997 ) .",
    "the blank sky data were reduced in the same manner , and the measured 2.22 @xmath2 m sky level of 0.45 adu / sec was subtracted from the 2.2 @xmath2 m image of ngc 4418 .",
    "additional sky subtraction was performed for each band by removing an offset equal to the average pixel value near the edges of each image .",
    "flux calibrations of the images were calculated using the conversion factors 2.031@xmath25 , 2.190@xmath25 , and 5.487@xmath25  jy ( adu / sec)@xmath20 at 1.1 , 1.6 , and 2.22 @xmath2 m , respectively , and corresponding magnitude zero - points of 1775 , 1083 , and 668 jy .    to enhance the details seen in all three bands and",
    "to achieve a common resolution , all three images were deconvolved using the iraf routine lucy and a point - spread function ( psf ) star observed on 1997 november 20 with the same filters and dither pattern as the ngc 4418 observations .",
    "the 1.1 @xmath2 m and 1.6 @xmath2 m images were then convolved with a gaussian using the routine gauss such that their resolutions matched that of the deconvolved 2.2 @xmath2 m image ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the resultant images are shown in figures 12 ; figure 1 shows the 1.1 @xmath2 m , 1.6 @xmath2 m , 2.2 @xmath2 m , and @xmath27 m @xmath28 m images separately in greyscale , and figure 2 is a three - color image of ngc 4418 .",
    "the mid - infrared observations of ngc 4418 were made on 1998 march 19 using the mirlin mid - infrared camera ( ressler et al .",
    "1994 ) at the f/40 bent cassegrain visitor port of the keck ii telescope .",
    "the camera uses a 128@xmath18128 si : as array with a plate scale of 0.138@xmath29/pixel for a total field of view of 17@xmath3017@xmath29 .",
    "table  1 gives the central wavelengths and filter bandwidths for the filters through which the object was observed . at each wavelength",
    "the observing procedure was the same .",
    "a secondary mirror with a square wave chop of amplitude 6@xmath29 in the east - west direction at 4 hz was employed for fast beam switching .",
    "the frames sampling each chop position were coadded separately in hardware , resulting in two images . after an interval of approximately a minute",
    ", the telescope was nodded perpendicular to the chop direction by 6@xmath29 and a second pair of images was obtained in order to cancel residuals in the sky and to subtract telescope emission .",
    "this procedure was repeated a number of times at each wavelength .",
    "the data were reduced by differencing the two images obtained within the chop pairs at each nod location , and then coadding the resulting positive images , with the positions appropriately adjusted to a common location , to yield a positive image centered in a field approximately 6@xmath31  6@xmath29 . because of the chopper and telescope nod spacings employed for the observations , the data are not capable of measuring flux outside a 6@xmath29 diameter region .",
    "the main objective of the observational program was focused on obtaining mid - infrared photometry of a large number of sources .",
    "hence only limited observations were made to constrain the size of ngc 4418 .",
    "the observations of ngc 4418 were immediately followed by observations of mrk 231 and hr 5340 both of which are assumed to be point - like , i.e. , the objects are assumed to be psfs .",
    "these observations took nearly an hour . at 24.5  @xmath2 m the psf s throughout the night equaled the diffraction limit of the telescope ; i.e. , 0.62@xmath29 fwhm .",
    "at the shorter wavelengths , the size of the psf image was set by diffraction and the pixel sampling about half of the time throughout the night ; at other times atmospheric seeing affected the image size .",
    "the variation in the measured size of the psf calibration star is the largest uncertainty in the limit of the source size .",
    "carico et al . ( 1988 ) measured @xmath32 and @xmath33 magnitudes of ngc 4418 of 12.97 , 12.20 , and 11.85 , respectively , in a 5@xmath17-diameter beam .",
    "the corresponding @xmath34 and @xmath35 colors are 0.77 and 0.35 , respectively . for comparison , magnitudes for the three nicmos images were calculated using a 5@xmath17 beam , and are measured to be @xmath36 mag , @xmath37 mag , and @xmath38 mag ( see also table 2 ) ; the latter two measurements are within 0.1 mag of the h and k measurements by carico et al .",
    "( 1988 ) . interpolating the 1.25@xmath2 m magnitude from the 1.1 and 1.6 @xmath2 m magnitudes ,",
    "@xmath39 is determined to be 12.92 mag , which is also within 0.1 mag of the carico et al .",
    "@xmath40band measurement .",
    "thus , @xmath41 mag , @xmath42 mag , and @xmath43 mag . subtracting the underlying galaxy from the nuclear component ( within @xmath44 , which is large enough to enclose the first airy ring of a 2.2 @xmath2 m nicmos psf ) yields @xmath45 mag , @xmath46 mag , and @xmath47 mag .",
    "the mid - infrared photometric data are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the photometry was calibrated based on observations of the bright star hr 1457 (= @xmath12 tau ) whose magnitudes , in turn , were based on iras photometry and intercomparisons with other bright stars over several nights . only the statistical uncertainty is given in table  1 .",
    "the uncertainties in the photometry , based on the internal consistency of the observations , are estimated to be 5@xmath48 at @xmath4917.9  @xmath2 m and 10% at 24.5  @xmath2 m .",
    "the flux density corresponding to 0.0 mag ( vega - based ) was taken to follow the prescription given in the explanatory supplement to the iras catalogs and atlases ( beichman et al  1989 ) .",
    "figure 1a  c show greyscale images of the nuclear region at 1.1 , 1.6 , and 2.2 @xmath2 m",
    ". the inner 300 pc of ngc 4418 has a spider - like morphology : the highest surface brightness emission emanates from a central linear structure @xmath1100 - 200 pc across at a position angle of @xmath50 .",
    "fainter emission extends radially outward from the linear structure , with the highest surface brightness extension oriented perpendicular to the linear structure .",
    "the resultant `` t''-like appearance of the higher surface brightness nuclear features is most apparent at 1.1 @xmath2 m .",
    "figure 3 shows plots of the intensity profiles along the major axis of the linear structure .",
    "the intensity profile shows marked asymmetries which may be due to extinction by foreground dust .",
    "the inner @xmath51 pixels of each image are within a resolution element of the images  outside of this range , the intensity profiles initially decrease in a nearly gaussian manner with radius , then exponentially .",
    "the width of the nucleus also decreases with wavelength ; the full width at half the maximum intensity is 0.80@xmath17 ( 105 pc ) at 1.1 @xmath2 m and 0.38@xmath17 ( 50 pc ) at 2.2 @xmath2 m . beyond a full width of 1.82@xmath17 ( 237 pc ) , the slopes of the profiles are shallow , and the intensity is most likely dominated by emission from the underlying galaxy .",
    "in addition to the radial emission structures , two dark lanes extend radially southwest from the nucleus ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "a more diffuse dark lane extends in the northern direction .      by a comparison with the sizes measured on hr 5340 and",
    "mrk 231 , ngc 4418 is unresolved at most mid - infrared wavelengths with these data .",
    "the upper limit depends on the wavelength , but subtracting the size of hr 5340 or mrk 231 from ngc 4418 in quadrature yields a size of approximately 0.23@xmath17 ( 30 pc ) diameter at 8 @xmath2 m , and there is perhaps some evidence that it is marginally extended by around 0.31@xmath17 ( 40 pc ) diameter in the silicate absorption feature near 10 @xmath2 m . at 24.5 @xmath2 m ,",
    "the upper limit on the size is 0.61@xmath17 ( 80 pc ) .",
    "these new near- and mid - infrared data provide a significant improvement in resolution relative to previously published data at these wavelengths ; near - infrared images of ngc 4418 obtained by zenner & lenzen ( 1993 ) have a resolution between 0.5@xmath17 and 1.3@xmath17 , and previously published 715 @xmath2",
    "m ( dale et al . 2000 ) and 1225@xmath2 m ( wynn - williams & becklin 1993 ) data have resolutions of @xmath52 and 3@xmath17 , respectively .    the near - infrared images of ngc 4418 are both striking and bemusing .",
    "in contrast to other luminous infrared galaxies imaged by nicmos as part of the nicmos gto program ( scoville et al . 2000 ) , the nucleus of ngc 4418 shows no direct evidence of star clusters . nor is there evidence of an unresolved agn as has been observed for warm luminous infrared galaxies such as ngc 7469 ( e.g. scoville et al .",
    "2000 ) . instead",
    ", it consists of a resolved , central high surface brightness structure with light and dark features extending radially outward .",
    "as discussed earlier , ngc 4418 has mid - infrared colors consistent with infrared galaxies observed to have seyfert - like emission line spectra .",
    "however , unlike warm galaxies such as ngc 7469 , the near - infrared colors of nucleus are not consistent with reddened agn - light ( see figure 5 of scoville et al .",
    "if the near - infrared emission is stellar in origin , then the age of the nuclear stellar population can be constrained by comparing its nicmos colors with stellar population synthesis models in which the stellar light has been matched with the bandpasses of the nicmos filters .",
    "models have been derived for a 3  300 myr bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ; 1995 ; private communications ) instantaneous starburst population having _ ( i ) _ a salpeter initial mass function _",
    "( ii ) _ a mass range 0.1125 m@xmath4 , _ ( iii ) _ and solar metallicity .",
    "a comparison between these models and the nuclear colors of ngc 4418 shows the nuclear colors to be redder than the models .",
    "the application of the rieke & lebofsky ( 1985 ) extinction law show the nuclear colors to be consistent with a 10 - 300 myr starburst suffering 2 ( screen model ) to 5 ( dust mixed with stars model ) magnitudes of visual extinction ( see also scoville et al .",
    "near - infrared spectroscopy of ngc 4418 ( ridgway , wynn - williams , & becklin 1994 ) shows a 2.3 @xmath2 m co absorption feature ( in a 2.7@xmath17 diameter beam centered on the nucleus ) ; the relative depth of the co absorption feature and the slope of the continuum emission are consistent with a late - type supergiant or metal - rich giant population .",
    "if the near - infrared light from the nuclear feature is supergiant starlight with a few magnitudes of visual extinction , this would indicate that the supergiants responsible for the 2.3@xmath2 m absorption feature are in front of the bulk of the silicate grains responsible for the absorption feature of ngc 4418 at 9.7@xmath2 m ( roche et al .",
    "1986 ; spoon et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "figure 4 is a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of ngc 4418 using the photometry derived from the nicmos and mirlin observations , combined with photometry from other sources ( carico et al .",
    "1990 ; iras fsc 1990 ; dale et al .",
    "2000 ) ; the beam sizes are listed in the figure legend . for comparison , the iso - pht - s data from spoon et al .",
    "( 2001 ) are also plotted .",
    "three key features of this sed are _",
    "( i ) _ a near - infrared thermal component which is likely due to the late - type supergiant population , _",
    "( ii ) _ the shape of the mirlin sed at mid - infrared wavelengths which clearly shows the presence of the silicate absorption feature in ngc 4418 observed by roche et al . ( 1986 ) and spoon et al . ( 2001 ) and _ ( iii ) _ the size of the 12 and 25@xmath2 m flux densities measured by iras which are recovered by the unresolved mirlin emission at those wavelengths . from the latter two features , it can be concluded that the energy source(s ) heating the silicate grains are confined to an area no more than 80 pc ( @xmath53 ) across .",
    "further , the highest resolution radio map of ngc 4418 obtained to date shows the radio emission to be less than @xmath54 in extent ( eales et al .",
    "1990 ) , providing further proof of the importance of the inner 80 pc to the total energy output of the galaxy .",
    "even given the overwhelming evidence at mid - infrared and radio wavelengths that the energy sources in ngc 4418 are confined in a nuclear region no more that 80 pc across , a direct measurement at the wavelength where most of the energy of ngc 4418 is emanating from  the far - infrared  is ideally desired .",
    "high - resolution imaging of the galaxy at these wavelengths is not presently possible , however , additional support for a compact far - infrared emission region can be provided via two approximations .",
    "for the first approximation , the assumption is made that the nuclear dust that is re - radiating light from the imbedded nuclear source(s ) in ngc 4418 is distributed in an optically thick sphere of diameter @xmath55 and outer blackbody temperature , @xmath56 .",
    "the dust temperature is calculated from the 60 and 100 @xmath57 flux densities , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , via the equation          where @xmath65 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , which yields a diameter of 0.54@xmath17 ( 70 pc ) .",
    "this is equivalent to the upper size limit of the 25@xmath2 m and radio emission of ngc 4418 , as well as the fwhm of its 2.2@xmath2 m emission .",
    "note that a source with a brightness temperature of 85k and a flux density of 9.32 jy at 25 @xmath2 m has a diameter of 0.41@xmath17 ( 53 pc ) , which is also consistent with the measured upper limit of the 25 @xmath2 m emission .",
    "if the dust emitting the far - infrared emission is associated with the star - forming molecular gas in ngc 4418 , the distribution of this gas in the nucleus of ngc 4418 can be used as an independent second approximation to the extent of the far - infrared emission .",
    "no interferometric co(@xmath66 ) data presently exist of ngc 4418 , however single - dish measurements have been made which provide a co luminosity , @xmath67 , and a velocity dispersion . using these data ,",
    "the assumption is made that the brightness temperature of the co(@xmath66 ) emission is equal to the dust temperature and that the gas has a unity filling factor .",
    "thus , the co diameter , @xmath68 , is derived via        if the size of 70 pc is adopted for the mid - to - far infrared emission region , then the surface brightness of ngc 4418 is calculated to be @xmath71 l@xmath4 kpc@xmath72 .",
    "figure 5 is a plot of infrared surface brightness versus infrared luminosity for a sample of galaxies imaged at mid - infrared wavelengths by soifer et al .",
    "( 2000 ; 2001 ) , as well as the orion star - forming complex and m82 ( see also soifer et al .",
    "the surface brightness of ngc 4418 is extreme , being comparable to that of the warm ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( e.g. , iras 05189 - 2524 , iras 08572 + 3915 , and mrk 231 ) and cool ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( @xmath73 ; which may be powered primarily by starburst , agn , or both ) such as arp 220 , ugc 5101 , and mrk 273 , a factor of 100 larger than that of m82 , and a factor of ten larger than that of the star forming complex in orion . in comparison to starburst galaxies with infrared luminosities moderately higher than ngc 4418 ( i.e. , ngc 1614 , ngc 2623 , ic 883 , ngc 6090 , mrk 331 : soifer et al .",
    "2001 ) , ngc 4418 has an infrared surface brightness a factor of 2100 higher . from the limited number of objects plotted in figure 5",
    ", there is no clear indication that infrared surface brightness alone can be used as a diagnostic between agn and starburst energy sources .      as previously mentioned ,",
    "dark lanes are observed to be associated with the central high surface brightness near - infrared peak of ngc 4418 .",
    "figure 1d shows an @xmath74 - @xmath75 image of ngc 4418 ; in this image , the dark lanes appear as cones extending away from the nucleus .",
    "there are two likely explanations for the nature of the dark lanes in the nucleus of ngc 4418 .",
    "the first possibility is that the features are dust lanes .",
    "such radial dust lanes are observed in the nucleus of spiral galaxy m51 , albeit on a smaller scale ( 50 pc : grillmair 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "the presence of such dust lanes , if they lie in the foreground of the nuclear infrared disk , may explain the asymmetries observed in figure 3 , however , it is difficult to understand why such radial dust lanes have not been destroyed by rotation .",
    "the second possible explanation for the dark lanes is that they are shadows cast from a partially obscured agn .",
    "such a possibility would require that the agn be visible along lines of sight that lie within the plane of the sky , but also require that certain lines of sight toward the agn in the plane of the sky are blocked , perhaps by the presence of molecular clouds .",
    "these two possibilities can be tested .",
    "first , if agn light is visible along lines of sights within the plane of the sky , then near - infrared , low surface - brightness light surrounding the inner nucleus should be polarized .",
    "second , if the dark lanes are nuclear dust lanes , co(@xmath66 ) observations of ngc 4418 should reveal evidence of molecular gas coindent with the lanes .",
    "such co observations would be useful in their own right as a confirmation of the high extinction to the nucleus calculated via the silicate absorption feature .",
    "given the new data presented in this paper and compiled from the literature , ngc 4418 appears to be a galaxy with nuclear power source(s ) which has(have ) been triggered via interactions with a companion galaxy 24 kpc away .",
    "the galaxy ngc 4418 has the following near- to mid - infrared properties :    _ ( i ) _ a compact , near - infrared nucleus consisting of a 100200 pc high - surface brightness linear feature surrounded by radial extensions , and near - infrared colors consistent with moderately extinguished supergiant stellar light ,          _",
    "( v ) _ a deep silicate absorption feature , which translates into @xmath77 mag of visual extinction to the central energy source(s ) ( see also roche et al . 1986 ; dudley & wynn - williams 1997 ; spoon et al .",
    "2001 ) ,        the basic picture of ngc 4418 is one in which a stellar core / disk approximately 150 pc in extent surrounds an imbedded agn or a compact starburst .",
    "so deeply buried is the central engine(s ) that even probing the galaxy at near - infrared wavelengths , where extinction is 510 mag rather than 50100 mag at optical wavelength , provides little information about the primary energy source in ngc 4418 .",
    "observations at longer wavelengths , using instruments such as mirlin , satellite infrared telescope facility ( sirtf ) , and the stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy ( sofia ) , will be required to determine the fundamental nature of this galaxy class .",

    "<S> the @xmath0 m data of ngc 4418 show no clear evidence of nuclear star clusters or of a reddened active galactic nucleus . instead , the nucleus of the galaxy consists of a @xmath1100200 pc linear structure with fainter structures extending radially outward . </S>",
    "<S> the near - infrared colors of the linear feature are consistent with a 10 - 300 myr starburst suffering moderate levels ( few magnitudes ) of visual extinction . at 7.924.5@xmath2 m , </S>",
    "<S> ngc 4418 has estimated size upper limits in the range of 3080 pc . </S>",
    "<S> these dimensions are consistent with the highest resolution radio observations obtained to date of ngc 4418 , as well as the size of 5070 pc expected for a blackbody with a temperature derived from the 25@xmath2 m , 60@xmath2 m , and 100@xmath2 m flux densities of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> further , a spectral energy distribution constructed from the multi - wavelength mid - infrared observations show the strong silicate absorption feature at 10@xmath2 m , consistent with previous mid - infrared observations of ngc 4418 .    </S>",
    "<S> an infrared surface brightness of @xmath3 l@xmath4 kpc@xmath5 is derived for ngc 4418 . </S>",
    "<S> such a value , though consistent with the surface brightness of warm ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( uligs : @xmath6 \\geq 10^{12}$ ] l@xmath4 ) such as iras 05189 - 2524 and iras 08572 + 3915 , is not large enough to distinguish ngc 4418 as a galaxy powered by an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , as opposed to a lower surface brightness starburst . </S>"
