    "hierarchy is an important organizational property in many biological and man - made systems , ranging from neural @xcite , ecological @xcite , metabolic @xcite , and genetic regulatory networks @xcite , to the organization of companies @xcite , cities @xcite , societies @xcite , and the internet @xcite .",
    "there are many types of hierarchy @xcite , but the one most relevant for biological networks  @xcite , especially neural networks @xcite , refers to a recursive organization of modules @xcite .",
    "modules are defined as highly connected clusters of entities that are only sparsely connected to entities in other clusters @xcite .",
    "such hierarchy has long been recognized as a ubiquitous and beneficial design principle of both natural and man - made systems @xcite .",
    "for example , in complex biological systems , the hierarchical composition of modules is thought to confer greater robustness and adaptability  @xcite , whereas in engineered designs , a hierarchical organization of simple structures accelerates the design , production , and redesign of artifacts @xcite .",
    "while most studies of hierarchy focus on producing methods to quantify it @xcite , a few have instead examined why hierarchy emerges in various systems . in some domains ,",
    "the emergence of hierarchy is well understood ; e.g. , in complex systems , such as social networks , ecosystems , and road networks , the emergence of hierarchy can be explained solely by local decisions and or interactions  @xcite .",
    "but , in biological systems , where the evolution of hierarchy is shaped by natural selection , why hierarchy evolves , and whether its evolution is due to direct or indirect selection , is an open and interesting question  @xcite .",
    "non - adaptive theories state that the hierarchy in some , but not all , types of biological networks may emerge as a by - product of random processes @xcite .",
    "most adaptive explanations claim that hierarchy is directly selected for because it confers evolvability @xcite , which is the ability of populations to quickly adapt to novel environments @xcite . yet in computational experiments that simulate natural evolution , hierarchy rarely , if ever , evolves on its own  @xcite , suggesting that alternate explanations are required to explain the evolutionary origins of hierarchy .",
    "moreover , even if hierarchy , once present , is directly selected for because of the evolvability it confers , explanations are still required for how that hierarchy emerges in the first place .    in this paper",
    "we investigate one such hypothesis : the existence of costs for network connections creates indirect selection for the evolution of hierarchy .",
    "this hypothesis is based on two lines of reasoning .",
    "the first is that hierarchy requires a recursive composition of modules @xcite , and",
    "the second is that hierarchy includes sparsity .",
    "a recent study demonstrated that both modularity and sparsity evolve because of the presence of a cost for network connections  @xcite .",
    "connection costs may therefore promote both modularity and sparsity , and thus may also promote the evolution of hierarchy .",
    "it is realistic to incorporate connection costs into biological network models because it is known that there are costs to create connections , maintain them , and transmit information along them @xcite .",
    "additionally , evidence supports the existence of a selection pressure in biological networks to minimize the net cost of connections .",
    "for example , multiple studies have shown that biological neural networks , which are hierarchical @xcite , have been organized to reduce their amount of wiring by having fewer long connections and by locating neurons optimally to reduce the wiring between them  @xcite .    a relationship between hierarchy and connection costs",
    "can also be observed in a variety of different man - made systems .",
    "for example , very large scale integrated circuits ( vlsi ) , which are designed to minimize wiring , are hierarchically organized @xcite . in organizations such as militaries and companies ,",
    "a hierarchical communication model has been shown to be an ideal configuration when there is a cost for communication links between organization members @xcite . however , there is no prior work that tests whether the presence of connection costs is responsible for the evolution of hierarchy .",
    "here we test that hypothesis in computational simulations of evolution and our experiments confirm that hierarchy does indeed evolve when there is a cost for network connections ( fig .",

    "[ fig : allresults]a )",
    ". networks receive 8-bit vectors as inputs .",
    "as shown , a successful network could and adjacent input pairs , xor the resulting pairs , and and the result .",
    "performance is a function only of the final output , and thus does not depend on how the network solves the problem ; other , non - hierarchical solutions also exist .

    "<S> additional analyses confirm that hierarchy independently improves adaptability after controlling for modularity . </S>",
