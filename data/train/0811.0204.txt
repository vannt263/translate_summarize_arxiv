    "spin - dynamics are finding wide interest in recent years as they usher in the prospect of finding their applications in quantum computing  @xcite , data storage  @xcite , biological and medical applications  @xcite , etc .",
    "the success of these goals are contingent on being able to control and detect the spin degrees of freedom concerned .",

    "we apply our model to analyze recent experimental observations  @xcite in mnas / gaas / mnas lateral spin - valve structure with paramagnetic mn impurities embedded in gaas ( fig .",
    "[ sct_struc ] ) .",
    "we attribute the origin of novel transient features such as the decay in the anti - parallel current over time ( fig .",
    "[ i_p_ap ] ) to dynamical polarization of paramagnetic mn impurities ( _ inset _ of fig .",
    "[ isf_sz_t ] ) and can successfully explain the scaling of the transient characteristics such as the magnitude and time - constant with temperature ( fig .",

    "our paper thus serves a two - fold purpose : ( i ) it identifies novel transport signatures pertaining to the underlying physical process of dynamical polarization of paramagnetic impurities embedded in a material carrying spin - polarized electrons which are coupled by exchange interaction to the impurities , and ( ii ) it identifies the effect of temperature and other electronic spin - relaxation mechanisms on the mentioned signatures .     for an applied bias @xmath3mv during parallel ( @xmath4:_top _ ) and anti - parallel ( @xmath5:_bottom _ ) configuration at different temperature for an sct structure with dimensions : @xmath6 m , @xmath7 m , @xmath8 m , @xmath9 m , and , @xmath10m.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",

    "@xcite needs to be modifeid to consider that ( i ) the magnetized mnas density of states and fermi velocity for the up and the down electrons are different around the chemical potential , and ( ii ) the up - spin and the down - spin electrons might see different electrochemical potentials @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively while tunneling across the forward ( reversed ) biased polarizer ( analyzer ) junction but the same electrostatic potential @xmath19 as the electrostatic potential depends on the total charge density .",
    "we introduce a contact polarization parameter @xmath20 to consider the first effect which implies that even if both the up - spin and down - spin electrons see the same electrochemical potential while tunneling across the barrier , the ratio of majority to minority spin - component of the current is , @xmath21 . in all our calculations",
    "we will follow the convention that when the two magnetic mnas contacts have parallel magnetization the majority ( will be denoted by @xmath22 ) and minority ( will be denoted by @xmath23 ) spin - components of both the contacts are up - spin ( will be denoted by @xmath24 ) and down - spin respectively ( denoted by @xmath25 ) .",

    "<S> using our model of spin polarized transport through schottky barriers at the two ferromagnet / semiconductor junctions in a spin - valve structure and a dynamical equation describing the paramagnetic impurities coupled to conduction band electrons we explain the scaling behaviour of observed transient features such as the magnitude and time - scale with temperature . </S>"
