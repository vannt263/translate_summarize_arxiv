    "in the last decades , a lot of effort has been devoted to understand dynamical arrest in soft matter systems .",
    "the pioneering investigations of hard - sphere ( hs ) colloids by pusey and van megen @xcite have shown that the hs glass transition occurs at a colloidal packing fraction @xmath0 .",
    "this transition has been interpreted by the ideal mode coupling theory ( mct ) @xcite for the glass transition . despite suffering of a shift of the actual glass transition value",
    ", mct provides a good description of the experimental data .",
    "the mechanism of arrest is explained in terms of the so - called ` cage effect ' @xcite , where particles at high densities become trapped by their nearest neighbours for an increasingly long time .",
    "this mechanism manifests itself in the form of a two - step decay of the density auto - correlation functions approaching the liquid - glass transition .",
    "subsequent investigations have focused on hs colloids in which an additional short - range attraction was added with the intent of mimicking the effective interaction ( i.e. depletion ) arising between colloids in suspension with non - absorbing polymers @xcite .",
    "a simple square - well ( sw ) attraction can be used to imitate these systems .",
    "mct predictions @xcite for the dynamics of the sw model at high densities revealed an intriguing behaviour .",
    "indeed , when the range of the well width @xmath1 is reduced down to a few percent of the particle diameter , a reentrant glass line is observed in the temperature - concentration phase diagram .",
    "this results in two different kind of glasses : a first glass ( named repulsive glass ) , which is found at high temperature @xmath2 , is the hs glass driven by the packing of particles , while a second glass ( named attractive glass ) is observed at low @xmath2 , when energetic effects are dominant and particles remain caged in their attractive wells . in between the two glasses , at intermediate temperatures , a reentrant liquid region occurs . therefore at the same concentration it is possible to go from one glass to the other by lowering @xmath2 and passing through a pocket of liquid states arising from the competition between energetic and entropic effects occurring at intermediate @xmath2 @xcite . at even higher densities , a glass - glass line is observed , which terminates at an endpoint named higher order singularity .",
    "associated to these multiple glasses and reentrant melting , mct predicts the occurrence of anomalous dynamics , which results in a logarithmic ( rather than two - step ) decay of the density auto - correlation functions approaching the endpoint singularity , as well as in a subdiffusive behaviour of the particles mean - squared - displacement ( msd ) .",
    "most of these predictions have been confirmed by several simulations @xcite and experiments @xcite . in particular , in simulations , it turns out to be useful to draw iso - diffusivity lines @xcite in the phase diagram .",
    "these lines maintain the same shape of the mct glass line at all ( sufficiently small ) values of @xmath3 , so that they provide a useful reference to establish whether a reentrance ( and eventually associated anomalous dynamics ) is present .",
    "the successful predictions of mct for the sw system paved the way for applications of the theory in a wide variety of soft matter systems .",
    "in particular , mct has been used to describe the arrested behaviour of several , purely repulsive systems . among these",
    "are star polymers @xcite , i.e. long polymer chains anchored onto a central core , where the number of chains ( arms ) varies the softness of the particles , bridging hs colloids ( in the limit of very large arm number ) to polymer chains ( when the arm number is limited to 2 ) . while one - component star polymer solutions only display a glass driven by packing of the stars @xcite , binary mixtures of stars of different arm numbers and sizes have been shown to display multiple glassy states through a combined effort of mct , simulations and experiments @xcite . despite indications that anomalous dynamics could be present in these systems @xcite ,",
    "a clear evidence from mct predictions has not been provided .",
    "in contrast , a recent theoretical study of binary , size - asymmetric hs mixtures has reported the occurrence of higher - order singularities and a variety of different glasses @xcite .    without necessarily turning to mixtures",
    ", it was recently realised that one - component systems with distinct length scales in the interaction potential ( the so - called core softened models ) are also promising candidates for detecting thermodynamic and dynamic anomalies @xcite . among these",
    ", the simplest model is the square shoulder ( ss ) model , where the hard - core is complemented by an additional repulsive corona .",
    "this model has been used to describe the behavior of some metallic glasses @xcite or complex materials like micellar @xcite or granular systems @xcite , as well as primitive model of silica @xcite and water @xcite .",
    "recent mct calculations reported the existence of multiple glass transitions also for the ss system both under compression and cooling @xcite . a peculiar behaviour of the ss model , with no counterpart in other investigated systems , is the prediction of a disconnected glass - glass transition with two endpoint singularities for certain values of the shoulder width @xmath1 .",
    "even though a rich phenomenology has been predicted for the ss system , numerical simulations aiming to confirm this behaviour have not been performed so far . in this work",
    "we provide an extensive and systematic characterisation of the ss model by means of event - driven molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations in order to describe its dynamical behaviour .",
    "we examine the one - component system as well as a suitably chosen binary mixture which is considered in order to avoid crystallisation at high densities and low temperatures , and to probe a sufficiently slow dynamics .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : methods ] we describe the simulation methods and provide a summary of mct . then in section",
    "[ sec : results ] we report our main results in four different subsections : in  [ sec : diff ] we discuss the behaviour of the self - diffusion coefficient calculated from the simulations and extract an ideal glass line using power - law fits of the data ; in  [ sec : mct ] we compare with existing mct results and perform new calculations for the binary mixture currently under study to closely compare the theoretical results with the simulations ; in  [ sec : hos ] we then search for the existence of the predicted mct higher order singularities ; in  [ sec : fq ] we report results for the non - ergodicity parameters obtained from theory and simulations to assess the types of the glasses that the system forms at various packing fractions and temperatures . finally in section  [ sec : discuss ] we discuss our findings and provide some conclusions and perspectives .",
    "we study a @xmath4 mixture of @xmath5 particles of species @xmath6 and @xmath7 interacting via pairwise ss potential @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the particles diameters ( and @xmath12 ) , @xmath13 are the shoulder widths , and @xmath14 is the shoulder height .",

    "the size ratio between the two species is @xmath20 .",
    "we also study the simple monodisperse version of the ss system with the same width . however , the one - component system crystallises before it has actually entered a sufficiently slowed - down regime of dynamics , similarly to what generally observed for one - component glass - formers",
    ". the introduction of a small asymmetry in the size of the two species favors particles rearrangements at state points where the one - component easily crystallizes .",
    "this allows us to investigate states that are several orders of magnitude slower than those that are possible to explore in the monodisperse case . in this way",
    ", we get as close as possible to the ideal glass line , which is defined as the locus of points in the packing fraction - temperature state diagram having diffusivity @xmath21 .",
    "we perform event - driven md simulations of the system as a function of @xmath2 and packing fraction , defined as @xmath22 , being @xmath23 , @xmath24 the edge of the cubic simulation box and @xmath25 the number of particles for each species .",
    "simulations are performed in the canonical and microcanonical ensemble . for the desired packing fraction an initial configuration",
    "is generated randomly and the particles velocities are extracted from a maxwell - boltzmann distribution corresponding to the desired @xmath2 .",
    "then , the system is equilibrated by performing md simulations in the canonical ensemble with appropriate rescaling of particle velocities .",
    "after the equilibration , for each state point investigated , nve simulations are performed for times ranging from @xmath26 for the highly diffusive state points , to @xmath27 for the most viscous state points .",
    "for all the simulations @xmath28 is measured in units of @xmath29 .",
    "a first comparison with mct results is possible by the calculation of iso - diffusivity lines , which typically preserve the shape of the ideal liquid - glass line .",
    "these lines , along which the self - diffusion coefficient @xmath3 is constant , are evaluated as follows .",
    "we first calculate the mean - squared displacement ( msd ) @xmath30 of the particles at several @xmath31 and extract @xmath3 from its long - time limit behavior , using einstein relation , @xmath32 then we identify state points with the same @xmath3 and connect them by iso-@xmath3 lines . repeating this procedure for lower and lower values of @xmath3 , typically covering a few orders of magnitude in @xmath3 , we can extrapolate the @xmath33-ideal glass line . to do this",
    ", we follow mct predictions for @xmath3 that should go to zero at the ideal glass transition with a power - law dependence .",
    "this should apply independently on the chosen path , and hence both along an isotherm @xmath34 and along an isochore @xmath35 here @xmath36 and @xmath37 are , respectively , the critical values of the packing fraction and temperature at the ideal glass transition , while @xmath38 is a non - universal exponent that is also determined by the theory . by performing the power - law fits , following eq .",
    "( [ eq : powerd_phi ] ) and ( [ eq : powerd_t ] ) , we can then trace the locus of points in the ( @xmath39 , @xmath2 ) phase diagram for which @xmath40 .",
    "this line can be directly compared to the mct glass line , as previously done for other systems @xcite .",
    "indeed , mct usually overestimates the tendency to form a glass , so that the two lines ( numerical and theoretical ) are always shifted by a certain amount in both @xmath2 and @xmath39 .",
    "however , the shape of the two lines has been found , for all previously investigated systems , to be identical : this makes possible to establish an effective bilinear mapping between the two curves so that they scale on top of each other , as it has been done for the sw model @xcite . in the presence of singular state points , such as the mct higher order singularities @xcite",
    ", the mapping procedure allows to estimate their exact location on the numerical phase diagram .",
    "indeed , for the sw system , it was shown @xcite that one of such singularities does exist by performing ad - hoc simulations near this particular state point . in the present work",
    ", we aim to carry out a similar , detailed investigation for the ss system .    to clarify some issues that will arise below",
    ", we briefly summarize the main aspects of mct here .",

    "mct predicts that , for @xmath55 , the correlator does not decay to zero but reaches a finite plateau value .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : vertex ] ) it is clear that the only inputs needed to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : fq ] ) are the number density @xmath56 and the static structure factor @xmath57 of the system .",
    "the latter can be obtained by solving the ornstein - zernike equation @xcite through the use of integral equations or it can be evaluated numerically from simulations .    besides the occurrence of a liquid - glass transition , under specific conditions , a system can display multiple glassy states , giving rise to the presence of glass - glass transitions in the kinetic phase diagram .",
    "these multiple glasses occur as bifurcations of the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fq ] ) upon variation of the control parameters . across a glass - glass transition",
    "the non - ergodicity parameter jumps discontinuously between two non - zero values .",
    "this transition is found to terminate at an endpoint , named higher - order singularity , beyond which one can go from one glassy solution to the other continuously .",
    "the higher - order singularities can be of type @xmath58 , when the two glasses coalesce already inside the glassy region , and of type @xmath59 when the two glasses merge also with the liquid solution right on top of the liquid glass line .",
    "the latter is a very special point occurring at @xmath60 , which can be identified by finely tuning the value of the control parameter @xmath1 @xcite , and in its vicinity the form of the decay of @xmath61 is predicted to be unique .    solving the full dynamical eq .",
    "( [ eq : mct ] ) close to any point on the liquid - glass transition , @xmath61 is found to follow a typical two - step decay .",
    "a first decay at short times corresponds to the characteristic time that particles employ to explore the cages formed by their nearest neighbors .",
    "a second decay occurs at longer time , and is characterized by the @xmath62-relaxation time associated to the structural rearrangements necessary for restoring the ergodicity in the fluid . in between these two regimes , @xmath61 displays a characteristic plateau which is associated to the size of the cages in which particles are rattling before finally escaping .",
    "it is well - accepted that the long - time relaxation of the correlators can be described by a stretched exponential @xmath63 where @xmath51 , @xmath64 give an estimate respectively of the non - ergodicity parameter , the @xmath62-relaxation time , while @xmath65 is the stretching exponent .    while no general analytic solution of the mct equations is provided for @xmath61 , its asymptotic form close to the glass is known . on approaching the liquid - glass transition ,",
    "the correlators are described by the von schweidler power - law decay @xcite .",
    "however , close to a higher order singularity , @xmath61 shows a peculiar logarithmic dependence : @xmath66 the parameters @xmath67 are the critical non - ergodicity parameter and critical amplitudes of first and second order in the expansion in @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "it is found that a specific value of the wave vector @xmath69 exists , at which @xmath70 is zero , thus allowing for a pure logarithmic decay of the correlator to be observed .",
    "hence , the correlators should display a characteristic concave ( convex ) shape for @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) in a logarithmic time scale .",
    "for the sw system , higher - order singularities have been predicted and observed by numerical simulations and experiments . in particular ,",
    "it was shown @xcite that mct predictions in this case are robust upon the use of different closure relations such as mean spherical approximation ( msa ) or percus - yevick ( py ) .",
    "different closures only produce a shift of the glass transition lines with respect to each other .    for the ss system the situation appears to be more complex .",
    "recent theoretical studies @xcite have shown that for the same value of the shoulder width , the use of two different closures , namely py and rogers - young ( ry ) , as input to the theory ( from now on denoted as ry - mct and py - mct respectively ) , provide qualitatively different results . while the liquid - glass line obtained within ry - mct displays two reentrances ( and hence diffusion minima and maxima )",
    "associated both to cooling ( as in the sw system ) and to compression , no reentrance is observed using py - mct . in the latter case",
    ", there is also no evidence of a glass - glass transition , while ry - mct predicts two glass - glass lines each terminating in a higher order singularity .",
    "however , for the ss system at the investigated @xmath1 , ry is expected to be superior to py in the description of its structural and thermodynamic properties . therefore",
    ", one of the aims of this work will be also to assess the validity of py - mct or ry - mct predictions in order to establish the correct scenario for the ss system while approaching the glass transition .",
    "we start by reporting the behavior of @xmath3 along isothermal and isochoric cuts in the ( @xmath39,@xmath2 ) phase diagram in order to assess the presence of diffusion anomalies , perhaps like the ones observed in other core - softened potentials @xcite , conceptually similar to the ss system .",
    "we remark that all shown data points do not crystallise and have reached a diffusive behaviour at long times , a condition necessary in order to extract @xmath3 . in the following , we report results only for @xmath6 particles , because the behaviour of the @xmath7 particles is qualitatively the same due to the quasi - one - component nature of the mixture .",

    "the normalization factor @xmath76 is introduced to account for the @xmath2 dependence of the particles average velocities .",
    "the behavior of @xmath77 with @xmath39 is similar along all studied isotherms : from the dilute limit @xmath77 decreases monotonically at all @xmath2 . for not too low @xmath2 ,",
    "the decrease becomes faster with increasing @xmath39 and is compatible with a power - law decay , as discussed below .",
    "notable exceptions are data points for @xmath78 : in these cases , a robust power - law dependence is not observed with decreasing @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , at @xmath75 the data show a much wider range of decay . for a deeper investigation",
    "we have performed simulations for @xmath79 and many adjacent @xmath39 with mesh 0.05 in the range @xmath80 .",
    "this has allowed us to carefully check that the behavior of @xmath77 is strictly monotonic within numerical error at the studied @xmath1 value of the ss model . however , despite the absence of a diffusivity maximum , we are tempted to speculate that at these low @xmath2 the observed slower decrease of @xmath77 seems to be an effect of the competition between the two length scales in the potential .",
    "indeed , at low enough @xmath39 the system behaves as being composed of effective hs particles of diameter @xmath81 , while with increasing @xmath39 the bare hard - core at @xmath82 becomes dominant , thereby providing an intermediate non - trivial @xmath39-dependence of @xmath77 .",

    "hence , we observe a sort of three - step behaviour of the msd : after the ballistic transient , subdiffusion takes place for roughly two decades in time , where @xmath118 with @xmath119 . at long times",
    "the typical pattern of glass - forming systems takes place : a plateau later followed by long - time diffusion .",
    "indeed , when @xmath2 is very low , the system is approaching the liquid - glass transition , that manifests itself in the msd as the emergence of the plateau .",

    "the plateau height is found to be @xmath122 .",

    "while the long - time behaviour , and associated plateau , is controlled by the liquid - glass transition , the additional intermediate behaviour , which indicates the presence of a sub - diffusive regime , can be associated to the presence of the higher order singularity .",
    "the presence of subdiffusivity is a hint of a closeby higher order singularity , but in order to provide a more convincing proof of its existence , we now look at the behaviour of the density auto - correlations functions .",

    "to visualise this behaviour one should be close enough to the @xmath108 point , but far enough from the liquid - glass transition in order to avoid that the final two - step decay covers most of the time - window and preempts the observation of the logarithmic behaviour .",

    "it is clear that with further decreasing @xmath2 the system approaches the liquid - glass transition , so that the signal of the logarithmic decay gets lost . indeed , the range where the logarithmic dependence ( dashed line ) is valid shrinks upon reducing @xmath2 .",
    "the evidence reported so far points to the existence of a higher order singularity in the vicinity of the explored path .",
    "while we can not probe its exact location , since the system falls out of equilibrium before this can be accessed , it seems to be located within , but not too far inside , the glassy region , compatibly with mct predictions of a disconnected glass - glass line .     for @xmath112 as a function of @xmath2 , indicated in the labels .",

    "we show the behaviour of the non - ergodicity parameters calculated within mct and extracted from the fits of the density auto - correlation functions in the simulations .",

    "[ fig : fq - mct ] .",
    "we find that along the liquid - glass line the theoretical @xmath138 follows two different types of behaviour : for @xmath139 , @xmath138 at first decreases , showing a shift of the peaks to larger wave vectors ( from state point 1 to 3 ) , while for @xmath140 at all temperatures below and above the reentrance @xmath138 maintains its peaks and only grows around them in a continuous way ( from state point 3 to 5 ) .",
    "we note that the @xmath138 of the lowest and highest @xmath2 ( states 1 and 5 ) corresponds to two glasses made , respectively , by effective hard spheres of diameter @xmath81 and hard spheres of diameter @xmath82 .",
    "it follows that the two @xmath138 can be superimposed on top of each other by simply readjusting the diameters . in between these two limits ,",
    "the system experiences the competition between the two length scales , which results in a non - trivial and non - monotonic behaviour of the non - ergodicity parameters .",
    "the crossover between the two regimes arises in a region that can not be associated with any of the two higher order singularities .",
    "furthermore , we also show in fig .",
    "[ fig : fq - mct ] the evolution of @xmath138 s for the ` disconnected ' glass , occurring upon crossing the glass - glass line . in this case",
    "the non - ergodicity parameters are much larger and longer - ranged in @xmath42 , indicating more tightly - caged glasses , in analogy with previous observations of repulsive glasses for star polymer mixtures@xcite . in the present case ,",
    "the cage size is approximately one half of that of the first glass , as it can be estimated by the @xmath42-range of the non - ergodicity parameters .",
    "we observe a non - monotonic behaviour when moving along the glass - glass line from low to high density , similarly to what observed for the liquid - glass line .",

    "we now extract the non - ergodicity parameters by fitting the density auto - correlation functions close to the arrest line via the stretched exponentials of eq .",
    "( [ eq : stretch ] ) . for simplicity , again we focus only on species @xmath6 , since the results are formally identical for both species .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : fq - simu ] the behaviour of @xmath141 along the liquid - glass line ( for the state points labeled in the upper inset ) .",
    "we find a behaviour that is remarkably similar to the mct predictions . indeed",
    ", again we find that the non - ergodicity parameter shows a non - monotonic behaviour ( at fixed @xmath42 ) with increasing @xmath39 .",
    "while at low @xmath39 and low @xmath2 , @xmath141 is compatible with that of a hs with effective diameter @xmath81 , it decreases at first with a shift of the peaks at larger @xmath42 for intermediate densities . then at a certain point , that we can roughly estimate as @xmath142 , the peaks do not move further in @xmath42 while @xmath141 starts to increase in magnitude .",
    "this continues until it behaves as the @xmath51 typical for hs of diameter @xmath82 .",
    "this interpretation is reinforced by the fact that we can perfectly scale the low-@xmath39 @xmath141 on top of the high @xmath39-one by simply scaling it for the effective diameter ( see lower inset ) .",
    "in addition , the behaviour of the stretching exponents obtained from the fits seems to indicate an increase of @xmath143 as the system moves along the liquid - glass line with increasing @xmath39 .",
    "hence glasses found at lower @xmath2 are considerably more stretched ( @xmath144 ) than those found at higher @xmath39 .    .",
    "lower inset : @xmath141 for low @xmath39 ( and low @xmath2 ) ( state point 1 ) is identical to that of high @xmath39 ( state point 6 ) upon a rescaling by the effective diameter @xmath81 ; ( b ) stretching exponents @xmath143 obtained from the fits as a function of wave vector for the same state points considered in ( a).,title=\"fig : \" ] .",

    "[ fig : fq - mct ] .",
    "in this work we have reported an extensive investigation by simulations and theory of the ss model . despite the simplicity of the model , its dynamical",
    "behaviour close to the glass transition had largely remained unexplored , while its thermodynamic phase diagram showing the presence of many crystal phases has been addressed in a number of publications @xcite .",
    "the recent predictions by mct of a unique behaviour of the glass transition for the ss model @xcite is the motivation for the present work . given the amount of effort requested to elucidate the various aspects of both liquid - glass transition and glass - glass lines , we have focused on a single value of the width of the ss model , referring to future studies to address the dependence on @xmath1 of the results presented here .",
    "our investigation initially focused on searching for the so - called diffusion anomalies , i.e. a local maximum in the self - diffusion coefficient , both upon compressing the system and upon cooling it , as predicted by mct .",
    "we performed the simulations down to a @xmath2-range at the limit of today computational capabilities and we did not detect the presence of an anomaly upon compression / expansion in contrast to theoretical results , as well as with other studies of core - softened potentials @xcite . however , none of these previous studies involved a potential with sharply - defined length scales such as the ss , so that this might be the reason why a different behaviour is observed . also , it remains to be established whether such different models share the intriguing glassy properties of the one - component ss model , as detailed mct studies have not been performed . to rule out in the ss model the presence of a diffusivity maximum in density",
    "we will need to explore other values of @xmath1 in the future .",
    "our preliminary investigations in this direction have also been negative in this respect , but we believe that we need to perform additional simulations for significantly slow state points in order to resolve this controversial aspect .",
    "the role of the ss width is also crucial within mct , because it controls the position of the glass - glass line and its endpoints with respect to the liquid - glass line .",
    "the present case was predicted to show two glass - glass lines merging from the liquid - glass one by ry - mct for the monodisperse ss @xcite .",
    "however , we have repeated the mct calculations for the binary mixture investigated by md simulations , which avoided the onset of crystallisation , and found a different topology .",
    "namely , a disconnected glass - glass transition lying all inside the glassy region with two endpoints , i.e. a scenario that ry - mct attributed to lower values of @xmath1 .",
    "such a shift in the control parameters is expected when comparing with mct , although for the sw model there was a remarkable good agreement between theory and simulations at the same @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "also no reentrance in @xmath39 was detected within the binary mct calculations , in agreement with the simulation results .",
    "the disconnected glass - glass topology seems to be confirmed by simulations , which have shown the presence of a regime of logarithmic decay of the correlators and of subdiffusive increase of the msd , in agreement with the predictions close to a higher order singularity .",
    "also the presence of the glass - glass line and its special endpoints , called @xmath108 and @xmath109 , is compatible with the presented results . however , to really confirm the predictions , it will be desirable in the future to approach these points in equilibrium , as previously done for the sw model , by a fine tuning of @xmath1 . again , we plan to undertake these investigations in the near future .    despite the absence of clear results about the glass - glass transition , we have found evidence that the non - ergodicity parameters along the liquid - glass line vary in a non - monotonic fashion , in very good agreement with the theory .",
    "we have shown that the glass found at low / intermediate @xmath39 ( e.g. @xmath83 ) and low @xmath2 is identical to that found at high @xmath39 ( and almost @xmath2-independent ) when a scaling of the effective diameter is performed to take into account the effect of the shoulder width .",
    "thus the system clearly displays two _ identical _ glasses , both of hs type , driven solely by excluded volume , and differing between themselves only by a change of length scale .",
    "however , the interplay between these two glasses is highly non - trivial , giving rise to anomalous behaviour in the dynamics , although not in the form of a local maximum in the diffusion coefficient , but in the form of clear subdiffusive regime in the msd and logarithmic dynamics of the density correlators .",
    "this is enhanced at a length scale that is compatible with that always associated as the main responsible for the hard - sphere transition , i.e. the nearest - neighbour length .",
    "it is a remarkable finding that this simple physics is capable of producing such non - trivial and unexpected dynamical behaviour .",
    "these results clearly show that , in order to find higher order mct singularities , it is not needed to rely on two different physical ingredients , such as attraction and repulsion , but competing isotropic repulsions are sufficient .",
    "finally another aspect that is very peculiar to the present study is the fact that at low @xmath39 we can approach the glass transition down to very low temperatures , without intervening crystallisation or phase separation .",
    "this was previously achieved in other systems with directional attraction , where however the dynamics at low @xmath2 was found to be dominated by bonding processes , showing an arrhenius dependence . here on the contrary , bonding is not present and the dynamics seems to always retain the fragile character of hs systems .",
    "the absence of phase separation at low @xmath2 and @xmath39 for the present system thus offers the unexplored possibility to investigate the glass transition at @xmath145 for @xmath146 ^ 3 $ ] for which current work is underway .",
