    "the interplay between superconductivity and quantum confinement has attracted growing interest due to the unique phenomena which appear if the electron motion is limited to the size smaller than the coherence length.@xcite the huge progress in nanotechnology which has been made in the last decade allows to prepare uniform ultrathin films  @xcite with new superconducting properties which were predicted many years ago.@xcite the oscillations of the superconducting energy gap as a function of the nanofilm thickness were predicted by blatt and thompson@xcite in 1963 .",

    "this fact is explained in term of the spatially varying energy gap induced by the confinement .",
    "the phase diagrams in the @xmath152 plane are presented for different values of @xmath58 . according to the obtained results the thickness - dependence is not visible in the phase diagrams when both the field and the temperature are normalized @xmath153 and @xmath127 .",
    "moreover , the interface effect on the electron - phonon coupling is included by using a simple approximation proposed in ref .  .",
    "this leads to a spatially dependent @xmath51 factor and its oscillatory behavior with increasing nanofilm thickness .",
    "as it is shown this effect leads to a suppression of the critical field values in comparison to the ones corresponding to the bulk .",
    "we believe that such approach allows for comparison of the calculated @xmath72 oscillations with the experimental results .",
