    "path integral monte carlo ( pimc )  @xcite and path integral molecular dynamics ( pimd )  @xcite have proven useful in the atomistic simulation of quantum effects occuring in condensed matter at low temperatures .",
    "the broad range of applications includes among other things superfluid @xmath2he  @xcite , isotope effects in crystalline rare gas solids  @xcite as well as phase transitions with strong quantum mechanical effects in josephson junctions  @xcite and molecular solids  @xcite .",
    "recently , path integral methods have also been applied to calculate low - temperature material properties of systems that are computationally less easily tractable than lennard - jones type systems : solid germanium  @xcite , crystalline polyethylene  @xcite , diamond  @xcite , silica  @xcite , and even wigner crystals  @xcite , to name a few .",
    "a disadvantage of pimc and pimd is the increase of necessary computing time @xmath3 with decreasing temperature @xmath4 at a given required accuracy .",
    "using the so - called primitive approximation together with the most efficient sampling algorithms that completely eliminate critical slowing down ( see ref .   for a thorough discussion ) , it is not possible to overcome @xmath5 .",
    "therefore different improvements on the primitive algorithms have been suggested that render path - integral simulations more efficient .",
    "one may subdivide the bulk of such attempts into three categories ( i ) methods that are based on higher - order approximants ( hoa ) of the high - temperature density matrix  @xcite , ( ii ) methods that use effective propagators ( epr ) that automatically yield the proper two - particle behavior  @xcite , and ( iii ) methods that decompose the hamiltonian into a harmonic and an anharmonic contribution before applying the trotter formula  @xcite .",
    "the latter category , also refered to as the effective potential ( ep ) method , will not be discussed any further in this study , mainly due to its unfavorable scaling of @xmath3 with particle number @xmath6 . additionally , harmonic approximations are problematic for many systems of interest , in particular those involving @xmath7he and @xmath2he .",
    "yet , another advantage of hoa and epr methods over the ep method is that the pathological behaviour of the attractive coulomb potential is overcome automatically  @xcite .    in this study , we want to compare the convergence of the hoa method , the epr method , and the primitive algorithm for a simple model system .",
    "as long as the interaction potentials are well - behaved , the convergence does generally not depend on the specific form of the potential  @xcite .",
    "the test model system should of course be chosen such that it does not favor intrinsically one approach over the other , e.g. , we may not chose a two - particle system , because then the epr model would be exact per definition .",
    "as we are not interested in the ep approach , we can chose a simple monoatomic chain with harmonic next - neighbor coupling .",
    "this choice of system enables us to do the bulk of the calculations analytically so that statistical error bars are eliminated completely .",
    "we also want to investigate how the trotter number @xmath0 necessary to keep the systematic errors below a well - defined percentage scales with inverse temperature for the different approaches investigated in this study .",
    "it should be emphasized that the hoa method and the epr method are conceptually different . in an epr path",

    "is done by simply evaluating the operator of the potential energy at the given distance . in a hoa path integral simulation ,",
    "generalized estimators have to be defined even for those observables that are orthogonal in real space .",
    "we will comment on this in more depth in the following section .",
    "in particular we will derive an expression for the hoa estimator of the radial distribution function , which has not been given hitherto , which might explain the sparse use of the method in the literature .",
    "the new estimator will be used to calculate the argon argon radial distribution function of those atoms in a simple three - dimensional lennard - jones crystal .",
    "the different methods employed in this study will be outlined in sec .",

    "all thermal expectation values of observables diagonal in real space can be determined directly from the configurations , e.g. , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the position of the @xmath14th monomer in the @xmath21th monte carlo step and @xmath22 is the number of observations in the monte carlo simulation .",
    "we refer to refs .   for further details on the primitive algorithm .",
    "the hoa method is based on a fourth - order hermitian trotter decomposition of the high - temperature density matrix  @xcite .",
    "the decomposition was first applied to continuous degrees of freedom by takahashi and imada  @xcite as well as by li and broughton  @xcite .",

    "( [ eq : prim_rad ] ) in order to calculate @xmath38 . based on this relation",
    ", one may say that the hoa method is not an importance sampling algorithm in the sense that the probability for a configuration to occur in the simulation is proportional to the diagonal elements of @xmath46 in a real space representation .",
    "an alternative non - primitive method to the hoa method is to construct effective potentials such that the two - particle propagators are reflected accurately , e.g. , it is correct in all orders of @xmath47 .",

    "the calculation of both the diagonal and the non - diagonal elements in more than one dimension is not trivial for non - harmonic potentials and we refer to ref .   for an in - depth discussion of that problem . for our one - dimensional model system ,",
    "however , the approach can be simplified significantly , i.e. , it can be solved analytically up to a summation over finite number of terms .",
    "this will be done in the section  [ sec : results ] .      in general the implementation of the full two - particle pair propagator with correct",
    "diagonal and non - diagonal elements is difficult because , one has to use the two - particle high - temperature density matrix ( htdm ) @xmath53 . in principle",
    "one can evaluate this expression prior to the simulation . however , this is a difficult task due to the dimensionality of the matrix , in particular for anharmonic @xmath54 dimensional systems .",
    "even if one expresses the htdm in the center of mass system of the coordinates @xmath55 and even if one uses an appropriate orientation of the axes within a molecular - fixed frame , one is a left with a three dimensional table and transformations between molecular fixed frames and laboratory system .",
    "it is also difficult to find good fit functions for the effective potential @xmath49 .",
    "the main idea of a reduced effective potential approach ( r - epr ) is to only incorporate those corrections to the primitive decomposition that are local , e.g. , those corrections that involve coordinates at different trotter indices are neglected . in other words , if one carries out a simulation at inverse temperature @xmath56 with trotter number @xmath0 , one uses an effectively classical potential that reproduces the correct two - particle distribution function in the low - density limit at inverse temperature @xmath57 .",
    "this approach is similar to an idea suggested by thirumalai et al .",

    "one can expect that the convergence rate does not depend on the observable , which is why it is sufficient to only investigate @xmath76 .",
    "the calculations for the three approaches will be separated into three subchapters .      in the primitive method ,",
    "the usual thermodynamic relationships can be used in a straightforward way without modification , albeit their use can be impractical for technical reasons . in order to calculate the thermal expectation value of @xmath76",

    "we disregarded methods making explicit use of a decomposition into a harmonic and an anharmonic part of the hamiltonian among other reasons due to the unfavorable scaling of the numerical effort with system size .",
    "the three main approaches investigated were the so - called primitive algorithm ( pa ) , a method based on a higher - order approximant ( hoa ) , and an approach in which an effective potential is constructed such that the one and two - particle high - temperature density matrices are reproduced exactly in the limit of small densities .",

    "the need to alter estimators for radial distribution functions obtained in simulations taking into account quantum effects in an effective potential had not yet been discussed hitherto .",

    "both epr and r - epr , however , give rather accurate results at small @xmath0 , e.g. , the relative error in the thermal expectation value of the potential energy is smaller than 10% in those approaches , while pa and hoa differ by nearly 100% at low temperatures and @xmath1 .",
    "the trotter number where convergence starts is similar in all approaches .",
    "if one requires high accuracy , e.g. 1% , one needs to increase the trotter number @xmath0 linearly in all approaches .",

    "the use of hoa is certainly a little more ( about twice ) cpu time expensive than that of epr , r - epr , and pa ( which all require approximataly the same amount of computing ) .",
    "this is because in an hoa based simulation , we need derivatives of the interaction potential that are one order higher than those in simulations based on epr , r - epr , and pa .",
