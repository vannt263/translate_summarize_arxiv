    "in context of ads / cft correspondence , it was proposed that variation of cosmological constant corresponds to varying the number of colors in the boundary field theory of yang - mills with chemical potential interpretation @xcite . on the other hand , according to teitelboim and henneaux s mechanism , coupling four - dimensional gravity with antisymmetric gauge field without cosmological constant results into appearance of the cosmological constant as a constant of motion teit , and therefore , the cosmological constant will be a variable .",
    "recently , the cosmological constant was considered as a state - dependant parameter in two dimensional dilaton gravity @xcite .",
    "it was shown that treating the cosmological constant as a @xmath4 charge with non - minimal coupling leads to confining electrostatic potential .",
    "larranaga showed that considering the cosmological constant as thermodynamical variable can be extended to use the smarr formula for inner and outer horizons of btz black hole @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been an increasing interest in thermodynamical behavior of black holes in asymptotically ads spacetime .",
    "this growing interest comes from the fact that using ads / cft correspondence , one can find answers regarding a conformal field theory of @xmath5-dimensions by solving problems that a gravitational field presents in ( @xmath6)-dimensional anti de sitter spacetime @xcite . hawking and page , in their pioneering work , showed that the similarity of phase transition between the stable large black hole and thermal gas in ads space can be interpreted as the confinement / deconfinement phase transition in the dual strongly coupled gauge theory @xcite .",
    "later , in an interesting article , witten showed that using ads / cft correspondence , one can study the thermal phase transition and the interpretation of confinement in gauge theories @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", one may consider the cosmological constant as a thermodynamical pressure ( in order to investigate the phase transition of black holes ) to extend the phase space ( see @xcite for more details ) and modify the first law of black holes thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "another contribution of this consideration is a renewed interpretation for the mass of black holes which from internal energy becomes enthalpy @xcite .",
    "this interpretation indicates that the mass of black holes plays more important role in thermodynamical structure of black holes and contains more information regarding phase structure of black holes @xcite .    for a canonical ensemble with a fixed charge",
    ", it was found that there exists a phase transition between small and large black holes .",
    "this phase transition behaves very like the gas / liquid phase transition in a van der waals system @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "phase transition of small / large black holes in ads / cft correspondence may be interpreted as conductor / superconductor regions of the condescend matter systems @xcite .",
    "considering the fact that maxwell theory contains some fundamental problems and nonlinear electromagnetic fields solve some of these shortcomings @xcite , one is motivated to study different models of nonlinear electrodynamics ( ned ) . one interesting class of these models is born - infeld ( bi ) type which is acquired in the low energy limit of heterotic string theory @xcite .",
    "therefore , one is motivated to study these theories ( which in this paper we have considered logarithmic @xcite and exponential forms @xcite ) and the nonlinearity effects of electromagnetic field on critical values representing phase transition of black holes .    on the other hand ,",
    "einstein gravity is not flawless and has some fundamental problems @xcite .",
    "generalization of the einstein gravity to higher orders of lovelock gravity is one way to solve some of these problems lovelock . besides , the lagrangian of lovelock gravity is obtainable through the use of the low energy effective action of string theory bi - st .",
    "one can take this fact into account that modification of einstein gravity may change the conserved quantities of black holes and therefore it is inevitable to see that critical values and phase transition may depend on the choice of gravity model .    in literature",
    ", there have been various studies regarding higher orders of lovelock gravity in presence of different ned @xcite .",
    "also , the phase transition and stability conditions of black holes in various gravity models have been studied intensively @xcite .",
    "these investigations lead to interesting consequences and phenomenologies @xcite . in this paper , we consider higher orders of lovelock gravity in presence of two classes of ned and study their phase structure .",
    "we investigate the effects of both nonlinearity of the electrodynamic models and lovelock parameters on the phase diagrams and the critical values .",
    "considering the fact that we are treating black holes as thermodynamical system and interpret the first law of black holes mechanics as the first law of thermodynamics , we expect to see the similar thermodynamical behavior for the black holes and usual thermodynamical systems .",
    "therefore , it is crucial to investigate phase transition and critical values of black holes .",
    "moreover , lovelock gravity is a generalization of the einstein gravity and it is a theory that solves some of the einstein gravity problems .",
    "hence , this generalization also gives a correction to calculated critical values of the einstein gravity .",
    "the thermodynamical behavior of this modification should be reasonable and consistent with thermodynamical concepts .",
    "furthermore , as it was mentioned before , nonlinear electromagnetic fields are introduced to solve shortcomings of maxwell theory .",
    "so it is reasonable to investigate nonlinear effects of ned on the phase transition of black holes .",
    "also , modifications of electrodynamics like gravitational parts must have consistent thermodynamical behavior .",
    "this paper is constructed in the following form .",
    "next section is devoted to introduction to higher orders of lovelock gravity and conserved quantities .",
    "then , we extend the phase space by considering cosmological constant as thermodynamical pressure and study the smarr formula of these black holes . after that , we calculate critical values and plot related diagrams for different cases .",
    "we give a detailed discussion regarding diagrams , their physical interpretations , and the effects of both ned and gravitational parameters .",
    "we finish our paper with closing remarks .",

    "so , we consider gauss - bonnet ( gb ) and third order of lovelock ( tol ) gravities and investigate extended phase space thermodynamics and critical behavior of these gravities .      at first , we take into account the gb gravity . in order to obtain the field equation of gb gravity , one should add the @xmath19 tensor to the left hand side of eq .",

    "we employ the approach in which the cosmological constant is a thermodynamical variable ( pressure ) with the following relation @xmath52    this consideration could be justified due to the fact that in quantum context , fundamental fixed parameters could vary .",

    "with doing so the total finite mass of the black hole will play the role of enthalpy and hence the corresponding gibbs free energy will be in form of @xmath54    using the mentioned comments , one can obtain the volume with the following form @xmath55which is consistent with topological structure of spherical symmetric spacetime .",
    "equation ( [ g ] ) was obtained in einstein gravity @xcite which indicates that although considering lovelock gravity modifies the metric function and some conserved quantities of the black hole , it does not change the volume of the black hole .",
    "in addition , it was shown that the smarr formula may be extended to lovelock gravity as well as nonlinear theories of electrodynamics @xcite .",

    "@xmath2 diagrams are representing energy level of different states that phase transition takes place between them and shows the changes in energy level of before and after phase transition states .",

    "finally , studying @xmath74 plot gives us information regarding the behavior of pressure as function of horizon radius , critical pressure and critical horizon radius ( volume ) of phase transition .",
    "one of the reasons for studying these diagrams is the similarity between phase structure of black holes and the van der waals thermodynamical systems .    in what follows ,",
    "we present various tables to investigate the effects of electrodynamics and gravity models on the critical values of phase transition .",
    "we also plot @xmath69 , @xmath71 and @xmath2 diagrams for gb and tol gravities and interpret them .",

    "@xmath79    @xmath80    @xmath81    @xmath82    @xmath83    @xmath84",
    "as one can confirm , higher orders of lovelock gravity modify the phase diagrams and critical values of volume , pressure and temperature ( see tables @xmath85  and related figs .",
    "of [ fig1 ] - [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "it is clear that considering higher orders of lovelock gravity leads to different kinds of thermodynamical systems which was also evident through calculated conserved quantities .    in this paper",
    ", we consider thermodynamical effects of lovelock gravity up to gb and tol , separately .",
    "it is evident that critical temperature and pressure are decreasing functions of @xmath72 and also orders of lovelock gravity whereas the critical volume is an increasing function of these two factors ( see figs .",
    "[ fig8 ] , [ fig9 ] , [ fig11 ] and [ fig12 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the energy gap between two phases increases drastically by transforming from lower order of lovelock gravity to higher one ( see figs .",
    "[ fig8 ] , [ fig9 ] , [ fig11 ] and [ fig12 ] right panels ) or by increasing @xmath72 for each order ( see figs .",
    "[ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] right panels ) .",
    "in addition , the length of subcritical isobars increases which means that the single phase region of small / large black holes decreases ( see figs . fig9 and [ fig12 ] middle panels ) .",
    "also , phase transitions region is an increasing function of @xmath72 and order of lovelock gravity ( see figs .",
    "[ fig9 ] and [ fig12 ] left panels ) .    to conclude ,",
    "plotted figures show that the highest critical temperature and pressure , and the lowest critical volume and energy gap belong to einstein gravity . on the other hand",
    ", system needs higher temperature to have phase transition in einstein gravity . whereas the critical temperature decreases by considering higher orders of lovelock gravity or increasing lovelock coefficients .",
    "considering the fact that increasing lovelock parameters and/or adding higher orders of lovelock gravity increase the power of gravity , one may say that in stronger gravitational regimes , phase transitions take place in lower temperature .    as for the effects of ned , we find the following results .",
    "it is evident that the critical temperature in which swallow tail is formed ( see figs . [ fig5 ] , [ fig11 ] and [ fig12 ] right panels ) and critical pressure ( see figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] , [ fig11 ] and [ fig12 ] left panels ) are decreasing functions of nonlinearity parameter whereas the critical volume is an increasing function .",
    "in addition , the length of subcritical isobars is an increasing function of nonlinearity parameter .",
    "this means that single phase region of small / large black holes is a decreasing function of @xmath73 ( see figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] , [ fig11 ] and [ fig12 ] middle panels ) .",
    "therefore , for higher values of nonlinearity parameter ( weak nonlinearity strength ) , black holes need to absorb less mass in order to have phase transition .",
    "another issue that must be taken into account is the fact that as @xmath73 increases , the gap between isobars decreases whereas for small @xmath73 this gap is greater .    due to the fact that we take into account bi type models , for large values of nonlinearity parameter",
    ", they will lead to maxwell theory . obtained results",
    "show that the lowest critical temperature and pressure and highest critical volume belong to maxwell theory . on the other hand",
    ", one can conclude that the power of the nonlinearity causes the system to need higher critical temperature to have a phase transition .",
    "this effect is opposite of what was observed for gravity .",
    "in addition , the energy gap between two phases , critical temperature and gibbs free energy are increasing functions of dimensions ( fig . [ fig10 ] ) .",
    "in other words , for higher dimensions , system needs to have more energy for having phase transition .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that subcritical isobars ( also critical region ) are increasing functions of dimensions ( see figs .",
    "[ fig10 ] middle panels ) . whereas critical volume is a decreasing function of dimensions .",
    "finally , the ratio @xmath3 is a decreasing ( an increasing ) function of @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) .",

    "in this paper , we have considered both gb and tol gravities in presence of two classes of bi type ned and studied their phase diagrams .",
    "we have considered cosmological constant as pressure and its conjugating quantity as thermodynamical volume .",
    "the obtained volume for these cases was consistent with topological structure of black holes and what was obtained previously @xcite .",
    "it was shown that although both higher orders of lovelock gravity and ned modify thermodynamical quantities but the volume of the black holes in these cases is independent of these two modifications and only depends on the topology of the solutions . by employing numerical method ,",
    "we have calculated critical thermodynamical values for different cases and studied the effects of gravitational and nonlinear electromagnetic field parameters on these critical values .",
    "it was shown that black holes under consideration have similar behavior as van der waals liquid - gas system .",
    "we found that critical temperature and pressure were decreasing functions of orders and/or coefficients of lovelock gravity and critical volume and energy gap were increasing functions of them .",
    "in other words , black holes with higher orders of lovelock gravity go under phase transition and acquire stable state with lower temperature comparing to einstein case . on the other hand ,",
    "the length of the subcritical isobars and region of the phase transition were increasing functions of the orders and/or coefficients of lovelock gravity .",
    "orders of the lovelock gravity are denoting different powers of the curvature scalar . from what we have obtained",
    ", one can argue that the critical temperature , pressure and the region of the small / large black holes are decreasing functions of the power of the curvature scalar .",
    "while , the critical volume , subcritical isobars and region of the phase transition are increasing functions of it . therefore , the power of the curvature scalar indeed has a crucial role in variation of the critical values .",
    "it is also regarded that considering the higher orders of lovelock theory , increases the power of gravity .",
    "it was shown that critical temperature and pressure were decreasing functions of @xmath73 whereas the critical volume is an increasing function of it . in comparison between bi type and maxwell electrodynamics",
    ", it was found that the lowest critical pressure and temperature and the largest critical volume belong to linear ( maxwell ) theory .",
    "the gravitational and electromagnetic fields have opposite effects on critical pressure and also phase transition . according to these results",
    ", one can say that phase transition is fundamentally related to both gravity and electrodynamics and their powers . as the power of gravitational field ( electromagnetic field ) increases ( decreases ) the critical temperature decreases ( increases ) .",
    "interaction between the gravitational and electrodynamic sectors of charged black hole may be found through the metric function .",
    "in addition , investigations of the phase diagrams confirm that they are weakening each others effects .    as for dimensionality",
    ", we found that as it increases , the energy gap , critical temperature and critical pressure increase .",
    "the universal ratio of @xmath3 was a decreasing function of @xmath73 and increasing function of dimensions and lovelock parameter .    for higher orders of lovelock gravity we have higher value of entropy ( @xmath92 ) which indicates that the thermodynamical system that the gravity describe contains higher value of disorder .",
    "in addition , considering higher orders of lovelock gravity will cause the black holes to have higher degree of complexity in their geometrical structure . if one considers the complexity of the geometrical structure as a disorder measurement of the system , it is logical to expect to see higher value of entropy for higher order of lovelock gravity . on the other hand",
    ", higher value of entropy means that our systems will have phase transition in lower critical temperature .",
    "that is the result that we have derived through our numerical calculations .",
    "it was shown that @xcite gb gravity in the presence of maxwell field has no phase transition for arbitrary electric charge in higher than @xmath93-dimensions . while we found that adjusting the nonlinearity parameter , @xmath73 , there is phase transition for various values of @xmath17 and @xmath94 .",
    "in other words , the nonlinearity parameter of electrodynamics has modified both electrodynamics and thermodynamical behavior of a black hole system .",
    "due to the opposite effects of gravitational power in lovelock gravity and the power of nonlinearity in electrodynamics , it is constructive to find the dominant effect for various domains of thermodynamical systems .",
    "also , one can study whether these two different fields for certain values of @xmath72 and @xmath73 , cancel each other effects or not .",
    "considering the effects of hawking radiation , we expect to see different behavior for higher orders of lovelock gravity .",
    "this indicates that in order to investigate black holes evaporation and phase transition of black holes , one could take both effects simultaneously .",
    "another interesting issue is studying the connection between complexity of the spacetime ( topological structure of black hole ) and entropy of the system and the interpretation of entropy as geometrical property .",
    "we leave these problems for the future work ."
