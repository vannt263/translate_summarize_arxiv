    "exploring the properties of compressed baryonic matter , or , more generally , strongly interacting matter at high densities and/or temperatures , has become a forefront area of modern physics .",

    "neutron stars contain compressed baryonic matter permanently in their centers .",
    "such stars are remnants of massive stars that blew apart in core - collapse supernova explosions .",
    "they are typically about 20 kilometers across and spin rapidly , often making many hundred rotations per second .",
    "many neutron stars form radio pulsars , emitting radio waves that appear from the earth to pulse on and off like a    lighthouse beacon as the star rotates at very high speeds .",
    "neutron stars in x - ray binaries accrete material from a companion star and flare to life with tremendous bursts of x - rays . depending on mass and rotational frequency , gravity compresses the matter in the cores of neutron stars to densities that are several times higher than the density of ordinary atomic nuclei . at such huge densities atoms themselves",
    "collapse , and atomic nuclei are squeezed so tightly together that new fundamental particles may be produced and novel states of matter be created .",

    "nicer will explore the exotic states of matter in the core regions of neutron stars , where , as mentioned just above , density and pressure are considerably higher than in atomic nuclei , confronting nuclear theory with unique observational constraints .",
    "there is also the theoretical possibility that quark matter made of up , down and strange quarks ( so - called strange quark matter @xcite ) may be more stable than ordinary nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "this so - called strange matter hypothesis constitutes one of the most startling possibilities regarding the behavior of superdense matter , which , if true , would have implications of fundamental importance for cosmology , the early universe , its evolution to the present day , and astrophysical compact objects such as neutron stars and white dwarfs ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",

    ", there is no sound scientific basis on which one can either confirm or reject the strange quark matter hypothesis so that it remains a serious possibility of fundamental significance for various astrophysical phenomena , as discussed in the next section @xcite .",
    "a bare quark star differs qualitatively from a neutron star which has a density at the surface of about 0.1 to @xmath12 .",
    "the thickness of the quark surface is just @xmath13 , the length scale of the strong interaction .",
    "the electrons at the surface of a quark star are held to quark matter electrostatically , and the thickness of the electron surface is several hundred fermis . since neither component , electrons and quark matter ,",
    "is held in place gravitationally , the eddington limit to the luminosity that a static surface may emit does not apply , so that bare quark stars may have photon luminosities much greater than @xmath14 .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that this value may be exceeded by many orders of magnitude by the luminosity of @xmath15 pairs produced by the coulomb barrier at the surface of a hot strange star . for a surface temperature of @xmath16",
    "k , the luminosity in the outflowing pair plasma was calculated to be as high as @xmath17 .",
    "such an effect may be a good observational signature of bare strange stars @xcite .",
    "if the strange star is dressed , that is , enveloped in a nuclear crust , however , the surface made of ordinary atomic matter would be subject to the eddington limit .",
    "hence the photon emissivity of a dressed quark star would be the same as for an ordinary neutron star .",
    "if quark matter at the stellar surface is in the cfl ( color - flavor locked ) phase the process of @xmath15 pair creation at the stellar quark matter surface may be turned off .",
    "this may be different for the early stages of a very hot cfl quark star @xcite .",
    "in contrast to neutron stars , the radii of self - bound quark stars decrease the lighter the stars , according to @xmath2 .",
    "the existence of nuclear crusts on quark stars changes the situation drastically @xcite .",
    "since the crust is bound gravitationally , the mass - radius relationship of quark stars with crusts can be qualitatively similar to mass - radius relationships of neutron stars and white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "in general , quark stars with or without nuclear crusts possess smaller radii than neutron stars .",
    "this implies that quark stars have smaller mass shedding ( break - up ) periods than neutron stars .",
    "moreover , due to the smaller radii of quarks stars , the complete sequence of quark stars  and not just those close to the mass peak , as it is the case for neutron stars  can sustain extremely rapid rotation @xcite .",
    "in particular , a strange star with a typical pulsar mass of around @xmath18 has a kepler period in the approximate range of @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "this is to be compared with @xmath20 for neutron stars of the same mass .",
    "one of the most amazing features of strange quark stars concerns the existence of ultra - high electric fields on their surfaces , which , for ordinary ( i.e. , non - superconducting ) quark matter , is around @xmath21  v / cm .",
    "if strange matter forms a color superconductor , as expected for such matter , the strength of the electric field may increase to values that exceed @xmath22  v / cm .",
    "the energy density associated with such huge electric fields is on the same order of magnitude as the energy density of strange matter itself , which may alter the masses and radii of strange quark stars at the 15% and 5% level , respectively @xcite .",
    "the electrons at the surface of a quark star are not necessarily in a fixed position but may rotate with respect to the quark matter star @xcite . in this event magnetic fields can be generated which , for moderate effective rotational frequencies between the electron layer and the stellar body , agree with the magnetic fields inferred for several central compact objects ( ccos ) .",
    "these objects could thus be interpreted as quark stars whose electron atmospheres rotate at frequencies that are moderately different ( @xmath23  hz ) from the rotational frequency of the quark star itself .",
    "last but not least , we mention that the electron surface layer may be strongly affected by the magnetic field of a quark star in such a way that the electron layer performs vortex hydrodynamical oscillations @xcite .",
    "the frequency spectrum of these oscillations has been derived in analytic form in ref .  @xcite .",
    "if the thermal x - ray spectra of quark stars are modulated by vortex hydrodynamical oscillations , the thermal spectra of compact stars , foremost central compact objects ( ccos ) and x - ray dim isolated neutron stars ( xdinss ) , could be used to verify the existence of these vibrational modes observationally . the central compact object",
    "1e 1207.4 - 5209 appears particularly interesting in this context , since its absorption features at 0.7 kev and 1.4 kev can be comfortably explained in the framework of the hydro - cyclotron oscillation model @xcite .",
    "rotating superconducting quark stars ought to be threaded with rotational vortex lines , within which the star s interior magnetic field is at least partially confined .",
    "the vortices ( and thus magnetic flux ) would be expelled from the star during stellar spin - down , leading to magnetic re - connection at the surface of the star and the prolific production of thermal energy .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that this energy release can re - heat quark stars to exceptionally high temperatures , such as observed for soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) , anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) , and x - ray dim isolated neutron stars ( xdins ) , and that sgrs , axps , and xdins may be linked ancestrally @xcite .",
    "the conversion of a neutron star to a hypothetical quark star could lead to quark novae .",

    ") ]    ) ]    usually , the structure of neutron stars is modeled with the assumption that they are perfect spheres .",
    "however , due to to very high magnetic fields , certain classes of neutron stars , such as magnetars and neutron stars containing cores of color superconducting quark matter @xcite , may be deformed .",
    "the stellar structure equation of such stars is given by @xcite @xmath24 here , @xmath25 is the energy - density , @xmath26 is the pressure , @xmath27 is the gravitational mass , and @xmath28 is a deformation constant .",
    "the star s total mass is given by @xmath29 . oblate ( prolate ) neutron stars are obtained for @xmath30 ( @xmath31 , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : g070 ] and [ fig : g130 ] , respectively . for @xmath32 , equation ( [ eq : gtov ] )",
    "reduces to the well known tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equation , which describes the properties of spherically symmetric neutron ( compact ) stars @xcite .    the mass - radius relationship of oblate compact stars , computed from eq .",
    "( [ eq : gtov ] ) for different @xmath28 values , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mr.oblate ] .    for simplicity ,",
    "the equation of state of a relativistic gas of deconfined quarks described by the mit bag model , @xmath33 , has been used here @xcite .",
    "the value of the bag constant is @xmath34 ( @xmath35  mev ) , which makes the quark gas absolutely stable with respect to nuclear matter .",
    "the results shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : g070 ] to [ fig : mr.oblate ] therefore are for strange quark stars .",
    "one sees that already relatively small deviations from spherical symmetry increase the masses of strange stars substantially .",
    "the change in central density of a neutron star whose frequency varies from zero to the mass shedding ( kepler ) frequency can be as large as 50 to 60% @xcite .",
    "this suggests that changes in the rotation rate of a neutron star may drive phase transitions and/or lead to significant compositional changes in the star s core @xcite . as a case in point , for some rotating neutron stars the mass and initial rotational frequency may be just such that the central density rises from below to above the critical density for dissolution of baryons into their quark constituents .",
    "this may be accompanied by a sudden shrinkage of the neutron star , effecting the star s moment of inertia and , thus , its spin - down behavior . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the spin - down of such a neutron star may be stopped or even reversed for tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years @xcite .",
    "the observation of an isolated neutron star which is spinning - up , rather than down , could thus hint at the existence of quark matter in its core .",
    "quark deconfinement in high - mass neutron stars has very recently been studied using extensions of the local and non - local 3-flavor nambu - jona lasinio ( njl ) model supplemented with repulsive vector interactions among the quarks ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the phase transition from confined hadronic matter to deconfined quark matter has been constructed via the gibbs    condition , which imposes global rather than local electric charge neutrality and baryon number conservation .",
    "depending on the strength of the quark vector repulsion , it was found that an extended mixed phase of confined hadronic matter and deconfined quarks can exist in neutron stars as massive as @xmath36 to @xmath37 . a phase of pure quark matter inside such high - mass neutron stars , while not excluded , is only obtained for certain parametrizations of the underlying lagrangians .",
    "the radii of all these stars are between 12 and 13  km , as expected for neutron stars of that mass @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ pb ] we show the relative particle fractions @xmath38 @xmath39 of neutron star matter as a function of baryon number density for the non - local njl model and using nl3 parametrization of ref .",
    "@xcite for the hadronic model .",
    "it can be seen that by increasing the strength of the vector interaction , negatively charged particles like @xmath40 s and @xmath41 s take on the role of electrons , whose primary duty is to make the stellar matter electrically neutral .",
    "because of the early onset of the @xmath42 population    in this model , there is less need for electrons so that their number density in the mixed phase is reduced compared to the outcome of standard mean - field / bag model calculations .",
    "the corresponding deleptonization densities , i.e.   the densities beyond which leptons are no longer present in quark - hybrid matter , depend on the ratio @xmath43 ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) @xcite .    since we model the quark - hadron phase transition in three - space , accounting for the fact that the electric and baryonic charge are conserved for neutron star matter , the pressure varies monotonically with the proportion of the phases in equilibrium , as shown in fig .  [ press ] .",
    "the hatched areas shown in this figure denote the mixed phase regions where confined hadronic matter and deconfined quark matter coexist .",
    "the quark matter contents of the maximum - mass neutron stars computed for these equations of state are also indicated ( @xmath46 values ) .",
    "pure quark matter would exist for @xmath47 .",
    "our calculations show that , in the non - local case , the inclusion of the quark vector coupling contribution shifts the onset of the phase transition to higher densities and narrows the width of the mixed quark - hadron phase , when compared to the case @xmath48 . to the contrary , when the quark matter phase is represented by the local njl model , the width of the mixed phase tends to be broader for finite @xmath43 values @xcite .    to account for the uncertainty in the theoretical predictions of the ratio @xmath43 ,",
    "we treat the vector coupling constant as a free parameter .",
    "we observed that the non local njl model is more sensitive to the increase of @xmath43 than the local model .",
    "for @xmath49 we have a shift of the onset of the quark - hadron phase transition to higher and higher densities , preventing quark deconfinement in the cores of neutron stars .",
    "however , we can reach values of @xmath43 up to @xmath50 for the local njl case .      whether or not quark deconfinement exists in static ( non - rotating ) neutron stars makes only very little difference to their properties , such as the range of possible masses and radii , which renders the detection of quark matter in such objects extremely complicated .",
    "this may be strikingly different for rotating neutron stars which develop quark matter cores in the course of spin - down .",
    "the reason being that such stars become more and more compressed as they spin down from high to low frequencies . for some rotating neutron stars the mass and initial rotational frequency may be just such that the central density rises from below to above the critical density for the dissolution of baryons into their quark constituents .",
    "this could affect the star s moment of inertia dramatically @xcite . depending on the rate at which quark matter is produced",
    ", the moment of inertia can decrease very anomalously , and could even introduce an era of stellar spin - up ( so - called `` backbending '' ) lasting for @xmath51 years @xcite . since the dipole age of millisecond pulsars is about @xmath52  years",
    ", one may estimate that roughly about 10% of the solitary millisecond pulsars presently known could be in the quark transition epoch and thus could be signaling the ongoing process of quark deconfinement .",
    "changes in the moment of inertia reflect themselves in the braking index , @xmath53 , of a rotating neutron star , as can be seen from @xcite @xmath54 where dots and primes denote derivatives with respect to time and @xmath55 , respectively . the last relation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : index ] ) constitutes the non - relativistic limit of the braking index .",
    "it is obvious that these expressions reduce to the canonical limit , @xmath56 , if the moment of inertia is completely independent of frequency . evidently , this is not the case for rapidly rotating neutron stars , and it fails for stars that experience pronounced internal changes ( as possibly driven by phase transitions ) which alter the moment of inertia significantly . in ref .  @xcite it was shown that the changes in the moment of inertia caused by the gradual transformation of hadronic matter into quark matter may lead to @xmath57 at the transition frequency where pure quark matter is produced .",
    "such dramatic anomalies in @xmath58 are not known for conventional neutron stars ( see , however , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , because their moments of inertia appear to vary smoothly with @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "the future astrophysical observation of a strong anomaly in the braking behavior of a pulsar may thus indicate that quark deconfinement is occurring at the pulsar s center .",
    "because of the competition between the coulomb and the surface energies associated with the positively charged regions of nuclear matter and negatively charged regions of quark matter , the mixed phase may develop geometrical structures ( e.g. , blobs , rods , slabs , as schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : qh_structures ] @xcite ) , similarly to what is expected of the sub - nuclear liquid - gas phase transition @xcite .",
    "the consequences of such a coulomb lattice for the thermal and transport properties of neutron stars have been studied in ref .",
    "it was found that at low        temperatures of @xmath59  k the neutrino emissivity from electron - blob bremsstrahlung scattering is at least as important as the total contribution from all other bremsstrahlung processes ( such as nucleon - nucleon and quark - quark bremsstrahlung ) and modified nucleon and quark urca processes .",
    "it is also worth noting that the scattering of degenerate electrons off rare phase blobs in the mixed phase region lowers the thermal conductivity by several orders of magnitude compared to a quark - hadron phase without geometric patterns .",
    "this may lead to significant changes in the thermal evolution of the neutron stars containing solid quark - hadron cores , which has not yet been studied .",
    "the presence of strange quark nuggets in the crustal matter of neutron stars could be a consequence of witten s strange quark matter hypothesis @xcite .",
    "the impact of such nuggets on the pycnonuclear reaction rates among heavy atomic nuclei has been studied in ref .",
    "particular emphasis was put on the consequences of color superconductivity on the reaction rates . depending on whether or not quark nuggets are in a color superconducting state , their electric charge distributions differ drastically , which was found to have dramatic consequences for the pycnonuclear reaction rates in the crusts of neutron stars .",
    "future nuclear fusion network calculations may thus have the potential to shed light on the existence of strange quark matter nuggets and on whether they are in a color superconducting state , as suggested by qcd .",
    "the r - mode instability of a rotating neutron star dissipates the star s rotational energy by coupling the angular momentum of the star to gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "this instability can be active in a newly formed isolated neutron star as well as in old neutron stars being spun up by accretion of matter from binary stars .",
    "if the interior contains quark matter , the r - mode instability and the gravitational wave signal may carry information about quark matter @xcite .",
