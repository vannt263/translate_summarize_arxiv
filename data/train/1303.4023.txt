    "stellar intensity interferometry ( sii ) is an experimental method for measuring the angular diameters and acquiring high resolution images of stars . in a stellar intensity interferometer ,",
    "the light from a star is received by two or more telescopes separated by a baseline that may range from tens of meters to kilometers , allowing for the resolution of surface features ranging from less than 0.1 milli - arcsecond ( mas ) ( longest baseline ) to 10 mas ( shortest baseline ) at visible wavelengths .",
    "intensity interferometry relies on the correlation between the light intensity fluctuations recorded by different telescopes @xcite .",
    "the fluctuations contain two components : the shot noise and the wave noise .",
    "the dominant component is the shot noise , which is the random fluctuation associated with the photon statistics , and which is uncorrelated between telescopes .",
    "the smaller component is the wave noise , which can be interpreted as the beating between different fourier components of the light reaching the different telescopes .",
    "the wave noise shows correlation between different telescopes provided there is some degree of mutual coherence in the light .",
    "the light intensity correlation between receivers @xmath0 is measured as the time - integrated product of the fluctuations @xmath1 in the photodetector currents .",
    "although higher order correlations can be of interest ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite , in this paper we will restrict ourselves to two - point correlations .",
    "still , the monte - carlo simulation approach described here could also be directly used for higher order correlation studies .    in the case of a thermal light source and an ideal intensity interferometer ,",
    "the two - point correlation is equal to the squared degree of coherence @xmath2 of the light at the two telescopes : @xmath3 where @xmath4 represents a time average . according to the van cittert - zernike theorem ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , the complex degree of coherence @xmath5 is the normalized fourier transform of the source radiance .",
    "one difficulty associated with image reconstruction using sii is that the measurable quantity is @xmath2 , implying that the phase of the fourier transform is lost .",
    "methods of phase recovery and image reconstruction have recently been developed and investigated ( @xcite and references therein ) and nuez showed that details of stellar surface features can be reconstructed with a relatively high degree of accuracy @xcite .",
    "sii can provide stellar imaging to investigate various topics of interest including stellar rotation , limb darkening @xcite , mass loss in be - stars , surface temperature inhomogeneities @xcite , and binary systems .",
    "it was shown by robert hanbury brown and richard twiss that the signal @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) in an intensity interferometry measurement is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the effective light collecting area of the telescopes , @xmath10 is the quantum efficiency of the photodetectors , @xmath11 @xmath12 is the spectral density of the light , @xmath13 is the signal bandwidth of the photodetectors and electronics , @xmath14 is the optical bandwidth of the light , and @xmath15 is the integration time @xcite .",
    "the noise @xmath16 ( @xmath7 ) is @xmath17    therefore the signal - to - noise ratio snr for an intensity correlation measurement with an ideal system is @xmath18 it is worth noting that the snr is independent of the optical bandwidth @xmath14 used for the observations .",
    "this expression for the snr only accounts for the photon statistics , previously referred to as the shot noise .",
    "the factor of @xmath19 accounts for the fact that starlight is non - polarized .",
    "if we consider fully polarized light then the snr is increased by a factor of @xmath19 .",
    "there is increasing interest in sii because of the relative ease to achieve long baselines as well as the advantages it may offer in terms of cost if implemented in conjunction with existing or future very high energy ( vhe ) gamma - ray act arrays ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "acts operate by taking advantage of the cherenkov light flashes produced by atmospheric showers . because the atmospheric cherenkov light is very faint",
    ", observations of vhe gamma - rays require large light collectors ( @xmath20 ) and are restricted to nights with little or no moonlight . during moonlit nights ,",
    "when act arrays are less effective for gamma - ray observations , they could be used for sii observations through narrow optical bandwidths .",
    "the implication is that sii measurements could be performed with act arrays with minimal interference with the vhe observation programs while increasing the scientific output of these instruments .",
    "arrays such as the cherenkov telescope array ( cta ) , which could consist of up to @xmath21100 telescopes @xcite could provide thousands of different baselines simultaneously and could offer detailed imaging capabilities . in previous studies characterizing sii sensitivity and imaging capabilities , it has been assumed that the detectors are point - like in size so the van cittert - zernike theorem applies directly and the degree of correlation between the intensity fluctuations is strictly proportional to the squared magnitude of the fourier transform of the source radiance .",
    "however , when the telescope aperture becomes comparable to the baseline separating the telescopes , then the light may no longer be regarded as fully coherent across individual apertures @xcite and the correlation data then departs from a pure fourier transform .",
    "additionally , other instrumentation - related systematic effects have been neglected in previous studies .",
    "for example , electronic artifacts such as single photon response pulse profile and excess noise affect the signal or contribute to the degradation of the snr . also , the effect of the night sky background light integrated in the point spread function ( psf ) of the light collector and the profile of the optical band pass have only been qualitatively or very approximately taken into account @xcite . furthermore , high speed digitization electronic systems are considered to be used for sii applications as they offer the flexibility of offline signal correlation analysis .",
    "the development of data analysis algorithms for such systems requires realistic simulated data .",
    "finally , other effects such as mirror non - isochronism and inaccuracies in time delay lines and star tracking can be investigated .",
    "all of these aspects are important for the performance characterization , data analysis preparation , and the design and deployment of an sii observatory .",
    "in this paper we present a monte - carlo simulation of a semi - classical quantum description of light and a simple instrumentation model we developed in order to investigate the above mentioned instrumentation - related effects .",
    "section  [ simul ] describes the simulation approach to achieve the proper photon statistics at the different telescopes and it also includes models of instrumentation effects such as the single photon response pulse and excess noise .",
    "section  [ app ] presents a few simulation applications characterizing instrumentation related effects , concentrating on the finite telescope diameter , the single photon pulse shape , the excess noise , and the night sky contamination . since there is no actual data available to test our simulations against , in each case we compare the results to simple models corresponding to ideal cases to obtain further validation of our approach .",
    "finally , the findings are summarized in section  [ conclu ] .",
    "we model a stellar light source with a total photon flux @xmath22 within a given optical bandwidth @xmath14 as a collection of @xmath23 discrete sources , each contributing an equal flux @xmath24 .",
    "each point source is defined by a wave amplitude @xmath25 , an angular frequency @xmath26 , a phase @xmath27 , and an angular position @xmath28 . at a given time , the phase @xmath27 of the light is taken randomly and uniformly from @xmath29 $ ] and the amplitude @xmath25 is taken randomly from a gauss deviate  @xcite of mean @xmath30 and variance @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the speed of light . in order to make the simulation closer to the continuous distribution of a realistic stellar source , at each time - step we also randomly set the angular frequency @xmath26 and angular position @xmath28 of each point source from distributions corresponding to the spectral density spectrum , radiance , and size of the simulated stellar source .",
    "each telescope mirror is modeled as a set of small light collecting elements of area @xmath33 centered on position @xmath34 .",
    "note that `` small '' in this context means that the mutual degree of coherence between any two points within any single area element is maximal .",
    "the average number of photons emitted by the star and incident on one area element @xmath35 of the telescope during a time - step @xmath36 can be written : @xmath37 throughout this paper , the notation @xmath38 denotes a statistical average while @xmath39 denotes a time average .",
    "the average number of star photons collected by telescope @xmath40 during a given time - step can then be written : @xmath41 note that @xmath42 is the time average of @xmath43 and @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the average number of photons emitted by the star and collected by the telescope in one time - step .",
    "the summation of the waves prior to taking the magnitude is responsible for the non - poisson distributed light intensity fluctuations , previously referred to as wave noise , displaying correlation between the different telescopes .",
    "the actual number of photons reaching telescope @xmath40 in a time @xmath36 consists of light from the star as well as stray background light and can be written as @xmath46 where @xmath47 represents a poisson deviate of mean and variance @xmath48 and the night sky contamination is defined in terms of the average source radiance ( @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a dimensionless factor which sets the amount of stray light ) .    in principle , with the description provided thus far , we can simulate any intensity interferometry signal , taking the time - step to be smaller than the coherence time @xmath51 of the light .",
    "however , in practice , it is desirable to be able to use a time - step @xmath52 comparable to the electronic time resolution @xmath53 while maintaining a manageable computation time .    to do this ,",
    "the correlated , non - poisson distributed photons are artificially diluted with a stream of purely poisson distributed photons . contaminating the starlight with purely",
    "poisson light degrades the snr equivalently to degrading the signal bandwidth , permitting simulations with @xmath54 . without affecting the mean number of photons incident on the telescope ,",
    "the instantaneous number of photons may be written : @xmath55 where the parameter @xmath56 sets the degree of dilution of the correlated photons without affecting the total photon rate .",
    "@xmath57 corresponds to a case in which the correlation is zero , while @xmath58 corresponds to a case of maximal correlation .",
    "we want to obtain the correlation between the signal fluctuations @xmath59 about the mean .",
    "they can be written @xmath60 , where we use @xmath61 so as to ensure @xmath62 .",
    "the correlation is computed as @xmath63 after correction of the mean of @xmath64 for the parameters @xmath65 , ( see appendix [ poisstat ] ) , we see that @xmath66 in the limit where the diameter of the telescopes is small compared to the distance required to begin to resolve surface features of the star .",
    "note that @xmath67 is equivalent to the @xmath68 term in eq .",
    "[ snr ] with @xmath69 .",
    "photons are recorded using electronic systems with a specific time response .",
    "it should be noted that in sii , it is the correlation between the high frequency fluctuations in light intensity recorded by different telescopes that is measured .",
    "such high frequency fluctuations are directly accessible through an ac coupling of the photo - detector . an ac coupled trace",
    "can be modeled using any desired single - photon response pulse whose integral is zero .",
    "the accumulation of individual photons , each modeled by an ac coupled pulse , directly provides the telescope signal @xmath59 . with a detailed pulse model",
    ", the sensitivity of a given system may be evaluated more precisely and the effects of experimental timing inaccuracies may be investigated . in this paper , for the application of our simulations , we restrict ourselves to studying the simplest case of an ac coupled square pulse so that our results can be compared to simple models to validate our approach .      to test that the simulations yield the correct correlation , we simulate a uniform disk star and calculate @xmath2 as a function of the baseline for point - like telescopes , ( using a square pulse of width @xmath70 ) , and neglecting detector excess noise and stray light contamination .",
    "figure [ fig : test1 ] shows the simulated data for a uniform disk star , @xmath71 in diameter observed with a point - like telescope with a @xmath72 flux collection area through a @xmath73 optical bandwidth centered on a wavelength of @xmath74 .",
    "the star , which has a flux @xmath75 through the selected optical bandwidth ( @xmath76 ) , was simulated for a duration of @xmath77 .",
    "the unrealistically large signal - to - noise ratio is obtained because of the use of a signal bandwidth that is only 10 times smaller than the optical bandwidth .",
    "we see that the signal reproduces an airy disk profile to high precision .",
    "however , we found that the fewer the number of point sources making up the star , the greater the power at high frequencies , which causes @xmath2 to deviate from the airy disk profile .",
    "additionally , we found that randomizing the location of each point source within the spatial extension of the star as well as randomizing the frequency emitted by each point source at each time - step is more representative of a realistic star and further reduces deviations from the airy disk .    the simulated data for the observation of a uniform disk star , @xmath78 in diameter is shown to reproduce an airy disk profile .",
    "see text for details .",
    "the data sets shown here are : a star consisting of 10 point sources which are not randomized at each time - step ( these points are indicated by @xmath79 ) ; a star consisting of 10 point sources which are randomized at each time - step ( indicated by * ) ; and a star consisting of 100 point sources which are randomized at each time - step ( indicated by + ) .",
    "deviations at large baselines are greatest when the star is simulated with fewer points and when the points of the star are not randomized at each time - step . ]    to further test our approach , we compared the expected snr calculated from eq .",
    "[ snr ] to the snr of simulated correlations . in these experiments , the excess noise and",
    "stray light contamination are set to zero .",
    "each numerical experiment was run @xmath80 times in order to calculate the standard deviation of each set of experimental parameters for a non - resolved star ( i.e. @xmath81 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : test2 ] , we compare the snr obtained from simulations to the snr calculated from eq .",
    "[ snr ] . for the signal bandwidth ,",
    "a square pulse was used so that the width of the pulse is unambiguous .",
    "the ac coupling was taken into account by subtracting the average signal rather than including a negative tail for the pulse , so the correlation is obtained between signals @xmath59 as described in section [ signals ] .",
    "the width @xmath70 of the pulse was varied from 1@xmath82 to 30@xmath82 and it is verified that the standard deviation evolved as a square root of the pulse width .",
    "similarly , the flux of the light source was varied from @xmath83 to @xmath84 .",
    "we see that the simulated snr precisely follows the prescription of eq .",
    "[ snr ] . the effect on the snr of varying the flux is equivalent to varying the light collecting area of the detectors .",
    "the effects of increasing the aperture will be further discussed in section [ extended ] .",
    "these results confirm that our monte - carlo approach provides consistent results in simple cases , and so , more subtle instrumentation artifacts can be investigated .",
    "shows data acquired from varying the pulse width @xmath70 , and the * shows data acquired from varying the flux @xmath85 .",
    "the ratio of the simulated to expected snr for various parameters fall around a 1:1 ratio indicated by the straight line . ]",
    "when the effect of the telescope mirror extension is important , corrections must be applied to the data before the van cittert - zernike theorem can be used .",
    "simulations can be exploited to establish this correction .",
    "the mirror extension effects are significant and corrections must be applied in most cases since telescopes that may be constructed in future arrays such as cta could be up to @xmath86 in diameter @xcite , which is comparable to intertelescope distances of current and future arrays .    we have investigated the effect of mirror extension on a @xmath87 diameter uniform disk star for various telescope diameters which are comparable to the dish sizes considered by cta .",
    "we see that the shape of the ideal curve , which is shown by the airy disk profile and by the simulated data for the case of a point - like detector ( i.e. too small to start resolving the star ) , is smoothed out as the size of individual detectors increases and begins to resolve the star .    in principle",
    ", the effect of large detector sizes on the degree of correlation is equivalent to taking a successive convolution of @xmath2 with the shape of the light collecting area of each individual telescope ( see appendix [ convolution ] ) @xcite , which moves @xmath2 away from being the squared magnitude of the fourier transform of the source .",
    "because the simulated star is a uniform disk , @xmath2 follows an airy disk profile independently from the orientation of the direction of the baseline with respect to the star .",
    "therefore , the airy disk in two dimensions may be obtained by assuming axial symmetry in the correlation data . in order to test the simulation algorithm against the successive convolution model",
    ", we simulated a pair of identical telescopes .",
    "the double convolutions of the simulated two - dimensional data for two telescopes with uniform disk - shaped light collecting areas of equal diameters , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 respectively are shown in figure [ fig : mirrorext_conv ] . within the standard error ,",
    "each data set agrees well with the prediction .",
    "the effect of mirror extension on image reconstruction capabilities requires a detailed study which can not be carried out in this paper .",
    "it may be possible to develop correction algorithms to apply to the data before analysis to partially alleviate the effect ; however , some information is lost in the successive convolutions .",

    "the physical parameters used in the simulations are the same as used in figure [ fig : test1 ] ]      in the high - frequency regime of interest here , most of the fluctuations of the telescope signal correspond to the poisson statistics of the collected photons . to this , we must add the fact that the detector response may fluctuate from photon to photon .",
    "this is known as the excess noise .",
    "for example , in the case of a photo - multiplier , the excess noise results primarily from the fluctuations in the number of electrons ejected at the first dynode .",
    "a typical excess noise level for a photo - multiplier is around 30% of the average single - photon response .",
    "the excess noise is uncorrelated between different telescopes but it may have the effect of reducing the snr achieved in the detection of a correlation between telescopes .",
    "here , we model the excess noise by multiplying each single photon pulse by a gaussian deviate whose mean is @xmath91 and whose standard deviation is @xmath92",
    ". however the gaussian is truncated at zero to avoid multiplication of the pulse by a negative factor . as a consequence ,",
    "the mean is greater than the most probable amplitude . in order for the mean single photon response amplitude to remain the same ,",
    "all signals are divided by the mean of the excess noise distribution . the snr expression in eq .",
    "[ snr ] accounts only for the fluctuations associated with photon statistics , so the simulations are used to gain an understanding of the noise introduced by the electronics .",
    "figure [ fig : exnoise ] shows the snr obtained from the simulations and from a model developed in appendix [ exn ] as a function of the excess noise .",
    "the model does not account for the truncation of the distribution of the single photon response pulse at zero .",
    "therefore , as expected , simulated data deviates increasingly from the model as the relative excess noise is increased .",
    "the simulated snr does not degrade as fast as suggested by the model since the distribution of pulse amplitudes is narrower due to the truncation effect .",
    "since the difference in snr between simulations with @xmath93 and @xmath94 at zero excess noise is smaller than the statistical error , we increased the number of simulation experiments by a factor of ten while maintaining all the parameters as in figure [ fig : exnoise ] in order to establish a clear difference between the sensitivities for these fluxes .",
    "we found that from the simulation , the normalized snr for a flux @xmath93 is @xmath95 compared to a model prediction of @xmath96 and for a flux @xmath94 , the snr is @xmath97 compared to a prediction of @xmath98 . for non - zero excess noise , the snr departs from the evaluation using eq .",
    "[ snr ] as discussed above .",
    "this type of study allows for a more accurate and realistic estimate of the sensitivity of an sii experiment .",
    "a more realistic model of the excess noise statistics , such as a polya distribution for photo - multiplier tubes @xcite can easily be incorporated into the simulation algorithm .",
    "similarly , the noise characteristics of other types of detectors , such as silicon photo - multipliers ( sipm ) , geiger - mode avalanche photodiodes , and micro - channel plate ( mcp ) photo - multipliers @xcite could be modeled as well .",

    "the model of the snr fits the simulated data well for lower values of excess noise . ]",
    "the simulations can also be used to investigate the effects of stray light contamination .",
    "when very faint stars are to be observed , the observation time must be long enough to obtain a sufficient snr for the measurement . in these cases ,",
    "contamination from the night sky background , especially during bright moonlit nights , can not be ignored .",
    "when the light received is dominated by the night sky background contamination , increasing the observation time is no longer beneficial .",
    "an arbitrary amount of stray light can be included in the simulation as a stream of additional photons with purely poisson statistics .",
    "the expected dependence of the snr on the amount of stray light is derived in appendix [ poisstat ] . to test this",
    ", we simulated a star of brightness @xmath107 and integrated over @xmath108 .",
    "the dependence of the snr as a function of the stray light , in terms of the brightness of the source , is shown in figure [ fig : bglight ] .",
    "we observe a good match between the simulated data and our model .     in terms of the source flux @xmath107 from an unresolved source observed for a duration of @xmath108 with @xmath72 light collecting area telescopes .",

    "stray light contamination ultimately limits the faintness of stars that can be observed . using the brightness of the night sky for various phases and distances from the moon from @xcite , figure [ fig : moonlight ]",
    "shows the magnitude of the stars whose brightness equals the night sky luminosity integrated within the psf .",
    "this situation corresponds to @xmath109 which results in a degradation of the snr by a factor of @xmath110 compared to @xmath111 ( i.e. no background light ) .",
    "we used an optical psf full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath112 , corresponding to the veritas telescope array @xcite .",
    "another limitation for the observability of a star is the practicality of the required integration time .",
    "for this reason , in figure [ fig : moonlight ] we include the integration time required to achieve a @xmath113 for a star with spectral density @xmath114 at @xmath115 using a telescope of area @xmath116 , a photodetector quantum efficiency of @xmath117 , and a signal bandwidth of @xmath118 .",
    "this does not take into account the fact that in a telescope array , the redundancy of the baselines can be used to improve the sensitivity .",
    "fwhm under various moonlight conditions .",
    "the horizontal axis shows the angular distance of the star from the moon , the vertical axis shows the faintest visual magnitude star that can be observed , and the various curves correspond to different phases of the moon , where + indicates a moon phase of @xmath119 , @xmath104 indicates a moon phase of @xmath120 , * indicates a moon phase of @xmath121 , and @xmath79 indicates a moon phase of @xmath122 .",
    "the right vertical axis shows the integration time required to achieve a @xmath113 for a star with spectral density @xmath114 at @xmath115 using a telescope of area @xmath116 , a photodetector quantum efficiency of @xmath117 , and a signal bandwidth of @xmath118 . ]",
    "in addition to limitations imposed by the moon , sii measurements may also be affected by other stars in the field of view of the telescope , especially when observing very faint stars .",
    "if there is a star which is as bright or brighter than the star of interest in the psf of the telescope then it is no longer possible to measure the star of interest . as the brightness of the star decreases then the average number of stars within the psf of the telescope increases , as shown in figure [ fig : stellardens ] .",
    "however , for stars brighter than magnitude 12 , given the low density of bright stars , other stars within the telescope psf are unlikely to interfere with measurements .",
    "stars of magnitude 12 or fainter will likely remain out of reach of sii because of the required integration time .     as a function of the apparent visual magnitude @xmath123 .",
    "the various curves correspond to the angular distances from the galactic plane , where + corresponds to an angular distance of @xmath124 , @xmath104 corresponds to an angular distance of @xmath119 , * corresponds to an angular distance of @xmath120 , and @xmath79 corresponds to an angular distance of @xmath121 .",

    "we have verified that the signal measured with spatially extended detectors is the successive convolutions of the normalized fourier transform of the source with the shape of each detector area .",
    "we also verified that the snr degrades as the excess noise increases according to a simple model developed in appendix [ exn ] .",
    "additionally , we find that the sensitivity degradation departs from our model for large values of excess noise , also as expected .",
    "finally , we see that when the contamination of starlight by the night sky background becomes important , the snr degrades so that increasing the observation time no longer offers benefits to the measurements .",
    "again we find that the snr degrades according to our simple model developed in appendix [ poisstat ] .",
    "these tests and comparisons of simulation results and simple models were made while isolating specific instrumental aspects one at a time .",
    "the good agreements obtained in all cases gives us confidence that the simulations may be used to characterize the performances of realistic instruments via their detailed modeling .",
    "this is important to gain an understanding of the sensitivity of existing and planned instruments and also this may be used to develop data correction algorithms so as to alleviate instrumental effects impacting the signals .",
    "many other effects that will be encountered during real sii measurements can also be investigated with the simulations .",
    "for example , the simulations can be used to investigate the effects of inaccuracies in the time alignment of the signals .",
    "furthermore , act optics are generally of davies - cotton design @xcite , which is not isochronous . in previous studies ,",
    "this was approximately accounted for as a signal bandwidth limitation while we could now simulate non - isochronous effects in detail .    a possible implementation approach to sii consists in digitizing the individual telescope signals .",
    "the required fast digitization rate , exceeding 100 mega - samples per second , implies that huge volumes of data must be handled .",

    "the total number of photons ( i.e. from the star and from the background light ) incident on a telescope @xmath40 in a time @xmath36 is given by @xmath126 where @xmath47 represents a poisson distribution of mean and variance @xmath48 , @xmath127 is the mean number of photons emitted by the star and collected by telescope @xmath40 , and @xmath128 with @xmath50 being a dimensionless factor which provides a measure of the amount of background light in terms of the amount of light from the star .",
    "the mean number of photons incident on a telescope is the sum of the photons from the star and from the night sky : @xmath129 where @xmath130 .    from equations [ eq : nti ] and [ eq : ntbar ] the signal from telescope @xmath40 is @xmath131 so that @xmath132 .",
    "the correlation @xmath64 between the two telescopes signals is : @xmath133 considering just the numerator :    @xmath134    using raikov s theorem , which states that for a random variable @xmath135 , if @xmath136 then @xmath137 can be rewritten : @xmath138 expanding and proceeding with the calculation by considering each term separately , it is found that : @xmath139 recalling the fact that @xmath44 .",

    "is derived from equation [ eq : sgnl ] with @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the spectral density of the star , and equation [ eq : noise ] with @xmath146 so that : @xmath147",
    "the effect of large telescope area may be quite significant in practice , so it is of interest to be able to predict how it affects and degrades the signal . to do this",
    ", first we set the origin of the coordinate system at the light source .",
    "points on the source are labeled by positions @xmath148 with respect to the origin .",
    "the vector radii to the same points from a far away observer at position @xmath149 are denoted : @xmath150 for a point - like detector , the observed amplitude at @xmath149 is @xmath151 where @xmath152 is a random phase caused by atmospheric turbulence among other factors .",
    "the following approximation can be made : @xmath153 so that @xmath154 if the detector has a finite area , then the amplitude at position @xmath149 is a superposition of amplitudes at positions @xmath155 , where @xmath156 are points in the detector with respect to position @xmath149 . the random phase can be expressed as a function of detector coordinates as @xmath157 .",
    "now the superposition of amplitudes is expressed as a convolution with the detector area , i.e. @xmath158 to calculate the time averaged correlation between detectors @xmath40 and @xmath159 , denoted as @xmath160 , note that @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the light intensity at point @xmath148 .",

    "now the quantity measured in intensity interferometry is @xmath175 therefore , the effect of having finite sized telescopes is to replace the magnitude of mutual degree of coherence @xmath2 by its successive convolutions with each of the telescope light collection area shapes .",

    "the number of photons incident on channel @xmath40 can also be written as the sum of a poisson term and a binomial term as follows : @xmath177 where @xmath178 is the probability that when a photon arrives in channel @xmath40 there is a correlated photon that also arrives in channel @xmath159 , @xmath179 and for simplicity we set @xmath180 , restricting ourselves to a situation in which @xmath181 .",
    "the excess noise is introduced as a gaussian variation in the single photon response pulse .",
    "our model simply multiplies the amplitude by a random gauss variable of mean 1 and standard deviation @xmath92 : @xmath182 where the signal @xmath183 is made to be ac coupled by subtracting the mean number of photons @xmath184 from the sum of individual photon signals ( each of mean @xmath185 ) so that the mean of the signal is @xmath186 .",
    "the quantity of interest is the effect that the gaussian factor has on the sensitivity of the measurement , so standard deviation of the following term will be calculated : @xmath188 with @xmath189 to lighten notation we assume that the two telescopes are identical and receive the same amount of light from the star ( i.e. @xmath190 ) .",
