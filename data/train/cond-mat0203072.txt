    "the problem of four particles with the coulomb interaction plays an important role in atomic and nuclear physics .",
    "it forms a link between the three - body problem , which can be solved numerically with very high precision , and many - body problems , solutions of which are very approximate .",
    "thus , profound studies of various four - particle systems can provide valuable insights into physics of systems with greater numbers of particles .",
    "in addition to the methodological interest , the four - body problem has unquestionable practical significance .",
    "positronium beams are extensively used in positronium - atom scattering experiments , but the positronium molecule , @xmath0 , has not been observed experimentally yet .",
    "all existing knowledge of its properties is based on numerical studies @xcite .",
    "molecules and ions including @xmath1-meson have attracted much attention traditionally in connection with the problem of the muon catalyzed fusion .",
    "calculations suggest @xcite that muonic molecules like @xmath2 have higher nuclear reaction rates than the corresponding three - particle ions .",
    "these examples show that high - precision numerical solution of the four - body problem is essential for proper understanding of various physical phenomena .",
    "the majority of four - particle systems are nonadiabatic , and can not be treated within the adiabatic approximation .",
    "the only practical way to calculate their energy and properties is to use the variational approach , taking into account the correlated motion of all the particles .",
    "basis functions of the gaussian type , depending on six interparticle separations and several nonlinear parameters , have been extensively used for such calculations @xcite .",
    "an important advantage of the gaussian functions is that all integrals can be easily evaluated .",
    "the nonlinear parameters are optimized stochastically @xcite : at each step of basis expansion , many functions with randomly generated parameters are examined , and the function , giving the largest decrease in energy , is added to the basis .    however , unlike real wavefunctions , the gaussian functions do not decay exponentially , and do not satisfy the cusp condition . from this point of view , they are rather unphysical . as a result , convergence of the variational procedure",
    "is very slow , and many hundreds of basis functions must be used .",
    "a recent calculation of the positronium molecule @xcite involved 1600 gaussian functions .",
    "it was suggested that further expansion of the basis was not practical because of increasing computation time and low probability of finding good parameters .",
    "thus , more efficient basis functions are clearly required .",
    "a method for analytic evaluation of four - particle integrals , proposed by fromm and hill @xcite , opened up possibilities of variational calculation of four - particle systems in a basis of exponential functions of interparticle separations .",
    "this method reduces computation of integrals , needed to determine matrix elements of a four - particle hamiltonian , to evaluation of the dilogarithmic function @xcite of various arguments .",
    "application of this method , however , is a very difficult problem . because the dilogarithm is a multiple valued function ,",
    "the entire algorithm can not be used without an effective procedure of branch and singularity tracking .",
    "this problem was initially solved by the authors for the case of real exponential parameters .",
    "the first calculations of the positronium molecule @xcite , and several mesic molecules @xcite in the exponential basis , depending on all six interparticle separations , have demonstrated high efficiency and great potential of this method . to the best of our knowledge , nobody else has done this yet @xcite .    because one exponential function is as effective as eight gaussians ,",
    "a size of the basis can be reduced significantly .",
    "however , an amount of time , needed to compute one matrix element , is much larger than for the gaussian basis .",
    "thus , optimization of nonlinear parameters is the main difficulty .",
    "deterministic optimization ( gradient descent ) gives excellent results for a relatively small number of exponential basis functions .",
    "stochastic optimization ( trial and error ) , used to expand the basis further , is inefficient due to a dramatic increase in computation time .",
    "this fact suggests that a possible alternative to an enormously large gaussian basis is a relatively short basis of the most efficient and versatile functions with carefully optimized parameters .",
    "a natural generalization of the exponential basis is the exponential - trigonometric basis , obtained by replacing real exponential parameters with complex ones @xcite .",
    "the exponential - trigonometric functions have been successfully employed in variational calculations of three - particle adiabatic systems @xcite .",
    "they are much more efficient , than the ordinary exponentials for two reasons .",
    "first , they contain twice as many nonlinear parameters , thus allowing better approximation of the wavefunction .",
    "second , they exhibit nonmonotonic dependence on interparticle separations , being able to imitate sharp peaks in wavefunctions of adiabatic systems .",
    "the computation time increases only insignificantly in comparison with the case of real exponential parameters .    in order to use the exponential - trigonometric basis in the four - body problem",
    ", one has to evaluate the four - particle integrals with complex parameters .",
    "the problem of branch tracking in a general complex case is formidable .",
    "every branch change for every multiple valued function has to be taken into account if correct values of the integrals are to be obtained .",
    "an original ( and , inevitably , very nontrivial ) procedure of numerical branch tracking has been developed by the authors .",
    "the first variational calculations of four - particle systems in the exponential - trigonometric basis proved extremely promising @xcite .",
    "they showed that one exponential - trigonometric function can replace seven exponential functions in calculation of @xmath0 , and several dozen exponentials in studies of adiabatic systems @xcite .",
    "therefore , it presents a real alternative to both the exponential and gaussian basis functions .    even though results of the calculations involving the exponential and exponential - trigonometric functions have been published @xcite , details of the new method",
    "have not been reported yet .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to fill this gap .",
    "we present a description of our algorithm that will enable a reader to implement it as a computer program .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "it has been shown by one of the authors that the matrix elements of the above hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of the overlap integral and six coulomb integrals only @xcite .",

    "an amount of time , required to carry out the entire recursive procedure , would be enormous .",

    "can it produce valuable results .",
    "the main difficulty in using eq .  ( 13 ) for the generating integral is the fact that the functions in this formula are multiple valued .",
    "indeed , the functions @xmath47 and @xmath46 , given by eqs .  ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) , are expressed in terms of the dilogarithmic function @xmath48 .",
    "the dilogarithm is defined as follows @xcite : @xmath95 this function is analytic inside the unit circle in the complex plane : @xmath96 in the immediate vicinity of the unit circle , where convergence of the series in eq .",
    "( 22 ) is slow , the following relations can be used to shift the argument of @xmath48 : @xmath97 @xmath98    presence of the logarithm in eqs .",
    "( 23 ) and ( 24 ) clearly indicates that the function @xmath48 is , in general , multiple valued . in order to specify its principal branch",
    "we need to fix the principal branch of the logarithm .",
    "the complex logarithm has branch points at 0 and @xmath99 .",
    "we choose its branch cut to run along the negative real axis and define the principal branch as follows : @xmath100 this choice determines branch cuts and fixes the principal branch for the dilogarithm , and the functions @xmath47 and @xmath46 .",
    "the function @xmath48 has branch points at 1 and @xmath99 ; its branch cut runs from 1 to @xmath99 along the positive real axis .",
    "the function @xmath47 has branch points at 0 , 1 , and @xmath99 ; its branch cut goes from 0 to @xmath99 along the positive real axis .",
    "the function @xmath46 has branch points at 1 , -1 , and @xmath99 ; its branch cuts run from @xmath99 to -1 along the negative real axis , and from 1 to @xmath99 along the positive real axis .",
    "1 exhibits the branch points and cuts for these multiple valued functions .",
    "it is important to note that the function @xmath61 , which is present in eq .",
    "( 13 ) and defined using eqs .",
    "( 18 ) and ( 19 ) , is also a multiple valued function .",
    "the complex square root has branch points at 0 and @xmath99 .",
    "we choose its branch cut to run along the positive real axis and define the principal branch as follows : @xmath101    it can be seen from the definition of the generating integral , eq .",
    "( 11 ) , that it is a continuous function of parameters @xmath37 for all values of these parameters satisfying the following conditions : @xmath102 @xmath103 these conditions mean , physically , that the wavefunction of a system of four particles decreases exponentially when any of the interparticle separations become infinitely large .",
    "if the parameters @xmath37 are complex , the above inequalities must be satisfied by their real parts .    the continuity of the generating integral , eq .",
    "( 11 ) , implies that the right hand side of eq .",
    "( 13 ) is also a continuous function of @xmath37 .",
    "this fact has two important consequences .",
    "first , the multiple valued functions @xmath47 , @xmath46 , and @xmath104 in eq .  ( 13 ) remain continuous while their branches change . as a point of interest moves in 12-dimensional space of six complex parameters , @xmath37 ,",
    "the arguments of these functions move freely in the complex plane , and their branches change repeatedly .",
    "however , a computer can evaluate only the principal branch of the logarithm , given by eq .",
    "( 26 ) , and the principal branch of the square root , given by eq .",
    "therefore , only the principal branches of the functions @xmath48 , @xmath47 , @xmath46 , and @xmath104 , defined in the complex plane with the branch cuts , can be calculated directly .",
    "thus , a special procedure of branch tracking is necessary to restore continuity of these functions every time their arguments cross the branch cuts .",
    "second , all singularities , which different terms in eq .  ( 13 ) can have , cancel mutually .",
    "these singularities arise when @xmath105 , and when any of the following equalities are satisfied : @xmath106 where for each @xmath6 : @xmath107 ; @xmath56 ; @xmath108 ; @xmath109 .",
    "these singularities are unphysical , and should have no effect on the value of the generating integral .",
    "as a point under consideration moves in the space of the parameters @xmath37 , the arguments of the functions @xmath47 and @xmath46 can frequently appear in the vicinity of the singular ( branch ) points . as a result ,",
    "the values of these functions can exhibit considerable change , even if the parameters @xmath37 change only slightly .",
    "therefore , a special procedure for dealing with the singularities is needed in order to carry out explicit cancellation of all singular terms .",
    "this discussion demonstrates that the method of @xcite is impossible to use without an effective algorithm for numerical branch and singularity tracking .      before discussing a general algorithm of branch tracking ,",
    "it is beneficial to consider a particular case , when all the exponential parameters , @xmath37 , are real numbers .",
    "let us introduce the following parametrization : @xmath110 as the real parameter @xmath111 changes from 0 to 1 , the corresponding point in 6-dimensional space moves from ( 1,1,1,1,1,1 ) to @xmath112 .",
    "if the parameters @xmath37 satisfy the conditions of eqs .",
    "( 28 ) and ( 29 ) , the parameters @xmath113 will satisfy these conditions for any @xmath111 between 0 and 1 .",
    "therefore , the generating integral , given by eq .",

    "it is known @xcite that eq .",
    "( 13 ) with the functions @xmath47 , @xmath46 , and @xmath104 , represented by their principal branches , yields the correct value for the generating integral at the reference point ( 1,1,1,1,1,1 ) .",
    "if this value changes continuously , as the parameter @xmath111 goes from 0 to 1 , one can be sure that the generating integral will be computed correctly at the final point @xmath112 .",
    "therefore , continuity of this integral is a criterion of the correct branch tracking .",
    "let us define a function @xmath114 as the sum in the square brackets of eq .",
    "( 13 ) when the parameters @xmath113 are used instead of @xmath37 : @xmath115 our purpose is to ensure that this function is continuous along the path from @xmath116 to @xmath117 .",
    "first , we consider a case when @xmath118 .",
    "the function @xmath119 is real , and all the arguments of the functions @xmath47 and @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( 32 ) are real as well .",
    "it will be shown in sec .",
    "ii.e that only imaginary parts of these functions exhibit discontinuities , when their arguments cross the branch cuts . because the generating integral is real , the imaginary parts of the functions @xmath47 and @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( 32 ) must cancel anyway .",
    "therefore , discontinuities in the real part of @xmath114 may appear near the singular points of the functions @xmath47 and @xmath46 only .",
    "the singularities of different terms in eq .",
    "( 32 ) should cancel one another .",
    "however , because of possible branch changes , complete cancellation may not happen .",
    "the formulas of sec .",
    "ii.e suggest that , near the singular points of @xmath47 and @xmath46 , the real part of the function @xmath114 can undergo changes by @xmath120 , where @xmath60 is some integer .",
    "thus , the function @xmath114 can have finite discontinuities , which are integer multiples of @xmath121 .",
    "from now on , the branch tracking is only a technical problem . to solve it , it is necessary to find all values of the parameter @xmath111 between 0 and 1 , which correspond to singular points .",
    "they include zeros of the sixth - order polynomial @xmath122 , and values of @xmath111 , at which the parameters @xmath113 satisfy any of the conditions of eq .",
    "let us denote the resulting set of numbers as @xmath123 , @xmath124 .",

    "the time , needed to determine the correction @xmath132 in eq .",

    "the case of @xmath133 is also straightforward .",
    "the quantity @xmath61 is now imaginary .",
    "the function @xmath114 is imaginary as well , thus giving a real value of the generating integral .",
