    "the study of the electromagnetic properties of the nucleon is of great importance in understanding the structure of baryons  see refs .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews . the most rigorous approach to low - energy phenomena in qcd is via numerical simulations in lattice gauge theory and many physical quantities , such as baryon masses , magnetic moments , etc.@xcite have been investigated within lattice qcd . because of computing limitations , most of those quantities are simulated with large quark ( @xmath2 ) masses and an extrapolation of lattice results to the physical @xmath2 mass is needed .",
    "early lattice extrapolations considered simple polynomial functions of @xmath2 mass .",
    "however , it is now widely acknowledged that the chiral non - analytic behavior predicted by chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath3pt ) must be incorporated in any quark mass extrapolation function @xcite .",
    "@xmath3pt has been a very useful approach to the study of low momentum processes involving mesons and baryons and has been used in various studies of baryon structure .",
    "it is based on an effective lagrangian constructed in a systematic way and consistent with all the symmetries of qcd .",
    "the first systematic discussion for the two flavor sector , i.e. the pion - nucleon system , of how to implement the ideas of chiral power counting @xcite , was performed in ref .",
    "however , treating the nucleons as relativistic dirac fields does not allow for a one - to - one correspondence between the expansion in small momenta and quark mass on the one hand and pion loops on the other . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , this shortcoming can be overcome if one makes use of methods borrowed from heavy quark effective field theory ( hqeft ) , namely to consider the baryons as extremely heavy , static sources .",
    "the relativistic or heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory has been applied to study a range of hadron properties in qcd , including nucleon magnetic moments and charge radii @xcite , the nucleon sigma commutator @xcite and moments of structure functions @xcite .    historically , most formulations of @xmath3pt are based on dimensional or infrared regularisation . however , the physical predictions of effective field theory must be regularisation scheme independent , such that other schemes are possible and may provide advantages over the traditional approach . indeed , donoghue @xmath4 @xmath5.@xcite have already reported the improved convergence of properties of effective theory formulated with what they called a  long - distance regulator \" . with the most detailed studies being on the extrapolation of the nucleon mass",
    ", it has been shown that the use of finite range regularisation ( frr ) enables the most systematically accurate connection of @xmath3pt and lattice simulation results @xcite .",
    "the frr @xmath3pt has been applied to the extrapolation of proton magnetic moment with the leading non - analytic contribution of pions @xcite .",
    "it was found that the smooth behavior of the lattice data , together with the series truncations of the frr expansion indicate that although higher order terms of dr can be individually large they effectively sum to zero in the region of interest .",
    "frr @xmath3pt provides a resummation of the chiral expansion that ensures that the slow variation of magnetic moments observed in lattice qcd arises naturally in the frr expansion .",
    "it was also predicted that the quenched and physical magnetic moments are in good agreement over a large range of pion mass , especially at large @xmath1 @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will extrapolate the proton and neutron magnetic moments , as well as the form factors at finite momentum transfer , within a framework based upon heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory .",
    "many methods have been used to compute the form factors at the physical value of the pion mass , including the early relativistic approach @xcite , heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory @xcite , the so - called small scale expansion @xcite , relativistic chiral perturbation theory @xcite , etc .. the spectral functions of the form factors have also been investigated by calculating the imaginary parts of the form factors @xcite .",
    "the disappointing observation was that a satisfactory description of the electromagnetic form factors was achieved only up to @xmath6 gev@xmath7 . in order to improve this situation",
    "it is natural to consider higher order terms in chiral perturbation theory but eventually the series must diverge .",
    "in fact , effectively resumming the series by including vector meson degrees of freedom led to a satisfactory description of the electromagnetic form factors up to @xmath8 gev@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "it is of interest to calculate the form factors at relatively large momentum transfer and pion mass because there are many experimental data in this region and it is a priority for lattice qcd to understand that data .",
    "because the values of the momentum transfer are quite large , it is not possible to make a systematic expansion in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "instead , we extrapolate as a function of @xmath1 at _ each _ separate value of @xmath0 . all the one loop contributions , including baryon octet and decuplet intermediate states , are considered .",
    "the quenched lattice data at large quark mass are used in the extrapolation , using the finding that the difference between quenched and full qcd data is usually quite small at large values of the pion mass . while this is a reasonable approach until high quality full qcd data is available ( for first dynamical studies see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , it does mean that in comparing with experiment we must remember that there is an unknown systematic error associated with the use of quenched data .",
    "so too , we have not had lattice data available which would permit an extrapolation to the continuum ( @xmath9 ) and infinite volume limits . in spite of all these caveats the results of this exploratory study are really very promising .",
    "there are many papers which deal with heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory  for details see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite . for completeness",
    ", we briefly introduce the formalism in this section . in the heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory , the lowest chiral lagrangian for the baryon - meson interaction which will be used in the calculation of the nucleon magnetic moments , including the octet and decuplet baryons , is expressed as @xmath10 \\nonumber \\\\ & & -i\\bar{t}_v^\\mu(v\\cdot { \\cal d})t_{v\\mu } + { \\cal c}(\\bar{t}_v^\\mu a_\\mu b_v+\\bar{b}_v a_\\mu t_v^\\mu),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the covariant spin - operator defined as @xmath12 here , @xmath13 is the nucleon four velocity ( in the rest frame , we have @xmath14 ) .",

    "until these conditions are satisfied it is a little early to draw strong conclusions about the validity of the extrapolation in pion mass from a comparison with experimental data for the form factors . indeed , that the current results lie within one standard deviation of the data at all values of @xmath0 is really a very positive result at the present stage .",
    "we do emphasis that our results are based on the lowest order lagrangian at one loop level in heavy baryon approximation .",

    "the leading non - analytic diagram provides the dominant curvature for the @xmath1 dependence of magnetic moments .",
    "the sum of higher - order one - loop terms provide only a small correction to this curvature .",
    "the one - loop contributions show that the proton ( neutron ) magnetic moment decreases ( increases ) quickly with increasing pion mass in the small @xmath1 region . at larger pion masses , their contributions change slowly and smoothly .",
    "the magnetic form factors are also studied at large @xmath0 where chiral nonanalytic behavior is suppressed . here , the importance of the pion form factor is also examined . for @xmath98 gev@xmath7 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 . upon including the pion form factor",
    ", these values will change to @xmath112 and @xmath113 indicating the effect is subtle .",

    "10 compare favorably with experiment and demonstrate the utility and accuracy of the chiral extrapolation methods presented herein . with the more accurate lattice data and treatment ,",
