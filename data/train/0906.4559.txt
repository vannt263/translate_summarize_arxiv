    "for accretion of matter onto astrophysical black holes , the local radial mach number @xmath0 of the accreting fluid can be defined as the ratio of the radial component of the local dynamical flow velocity to that of the propagation of the acoustic perturbation embedded inside the accreting matter",
    ". the flow will be locally subsonic or supersonic according to @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "the flow is transonic if at any moment it crosses the @xmath3 hypersurface .",
    "this happens when a subsonic to supersonic or supersonic to subsonic transition takes place either continuously or discontinuously .",
    "the point(s ) where such crossing takes place continuously is ( are ) called sonic point(s ) , and where such crossing takes place discontinuously are called shocks or discontinuities .",
    "the particular value of the radial distance @xmath4 for which @xmath3 , is referred as the transonic point or the sonic point , and will be denoted by @xmath5 hereafter . for @xmath6 ,",
    "infalling matter becomes supersonic .",
    "any acoustic perturbation created in such a region is destined to be dragged toward the black hole , and can not escape to the domain @xmath7 .",
    "in other words , any co - moving observer from @xmath8 region can not communicate with any observer ( co - moving or stationary ) located in the sub - domain @xmath7 by sending any signal which travels with velocity @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is defined as the velocity of propagation of the acoustic perturbation ( the sound speed ) embedded in the moving fluid .",
    "hence the hypersurface through @xmath5 is generated by the acoustic null geodesics , i.e. , by the phonon trajectories , and is actually an acoustic horizon for stationary configuration , which is produced when accreting fluid makes a transition from subsonic ( @xmath1 ) to the supersonic ( @xmath11 ) state . at a distance far away from the black hole",
    ", accreting material almost always remains subsonic ( except possibly for the supersonic stellar wind fed accretion ) since it possesses negligible dynamical flow velocity . on the other hand",
    ", the flow velocity will approach the velocity of light @xmath12 while crossing the event horizon , while the maximum possible value of sound speed , even for the steepest possible equation of state , would be @xmath13 , resulting @xmath14 close to the event horizon . in order to satisfy such inner boundary condition imposed by the event horizon , accretion onto black holes exhibit",
    "transonic properties in general , see , e.g. , @xcite for further details",
    ".    it will be shown in the subsequent sections that the physical transonic accretion solutions can formally be realized as critical solution on the phase portrait ( spanned by dynamical flow / mach number and the radial distance ) of the black hole accretion .",
    "it will also be discussed , in great details , that usually a critical point is not identical with a sonic point . for sub - keplerian angular momentum distribution of matter",
    ", frequently it happens that the critical features are exhibited more than once in the phase portrait of a stationary solutions describing an axisymmetric black hole accretion .",
    "for such situations , the number of critical points , unlike spherical accretion , may exceed one . a large pool of literature , dealing with the theory of the black hole accretion disc , studied various properties of such flows with multiple critical points @xcite .    for realistic astrophysical systems ,",
    "such sub - keplerian weakly rotating flows are exhibited in various physical situations , such as detached binary systems fed by accretion from ob stellar winds ( @xcite ) , semi - detached low - mass non - magnetic binaries (  @xcite ) , and super - massive black holes fed by accretion from slowly rotating central stellar clusters ( @xcite and references therein ) . even for a standard keplerian accretion disc ,",
    "turbulence may produce such low angular momentum flow ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "in supersonic astrophysical flows , perturbation of various kinds may produce discontinuities .",
    "such discontinuities are said to take place over one or more surfaces when any dynamical and/or thermodynamic quantity changes discontinuously as such surfaces are crossed .",
    "the corresponding surfaces are called the surfaces of discontinuity .",
    "certain boundary conditions are to be satisfied across such surfaces , and according to those conditions , surfaces of discontinuities are classified into various categories , the most important being the shock waves or shocks .",
    "such shock waves are quite often generated in various kinds of supersonic astrophysical flows having intrinsic angular momentum , resulting the final state of the flow to be subsonic .",
    "this is because the repulsive centrifugal potential barrier experienced by such flows is sufficiently strong to brake the infalling motion and a stationary solution could be introduced only through a shock .",
    "rotating , transonic astrophysical fluid flows are thus believed to be ` prone ' to the shock formation phenomena .",
    "the non - linear equations describing the steady , inviscid axisymmetric flow in the kerr metric can be tailored to form a first order autonomous dynamical system .",
    "physical transonic solution in such flows can be represented mathematically as critical solutions in the velocity ( or mach number ) phase plane of the flow  they are associated with the critical points ( alternatively known as the fixed points or the equilibrium points , see @xcite and @xcite for further details about the fixed point analysis techniques ) . to maintain the transonicity such critical points",
    "will perforce have to be saddle points , which will enable a solution to pass through themselves .",
    "before we proceed further , it is important to introduce a few nomenclatures we will be following in this work .",
    "when a configuration can have multiple critical points accessible to the accretion flow , we will mention it as ` multi - critical ' accretion .",
    "critical points for a non dissipative system can be of two types , either saddle or centre .",
    "a saddle type critical points allows an accretion flow to pass through it whereas a centre type critical point does not .",
    "hence the concept of a ` sonic point ' can only be associated with a saddle type critical point and not with a centre type one .",
    "no transonic solution can pass through a centre type critical point .",
    "we will demonstrate that a saddle type critical point usually has a sonic point associated with it . as a result ,",
    "a multi - critical flow having three critical points , two saddle and one centre type , can only have two sonic points .",
    "a ` multi - transonic ' flow , according to our definition , will be a particular subclass of multi - critical transonic accretion which can pass through two sonic points .",
    "this is possible , as we will see in subsequent sections , only if a shock forms .",
    "otherwise , even if a flow has more than one saddle type critical points , transonic accretion passes only through a single sonic point .",
    "such flows will in generally be termed as a ` multi - ctritical mono - transonic ' flow in our work . on the contrary , when the number of the critical point itself is one , and that critical point is of saddle type so that a sonic point is also associated with the flow , we will call it a ` mono - critical mono - transonic ' flow .",
    "we will see in the subsequent sections that among the several phases of the transonic accretion flow , a true multi - transonic flow forms only for a shocked accretion , otherwise all accretion flows are mono - transonic : either of the multi - critical mono - transonic category or of mono - critical mono - transonic category .",
    "all these issues will further be elaborated with greater detail in subsequent sections .",
    "the true multi - transonicity in the kerr geometry implies the existence of three critical points and a standing shock , and under the fundamental physical requirement of accretion being a process whereby a flow solution should connect infinity to the event horizon of the black hole , the three critical points should be such that there would be two saddle points flanking a centre type point between themselves .",
    "originating at a large distance , subsonic accretion encounters the outermost saddle type sonic point and becomes supersonic .",
    "subjected to the appropriate perturbative environment , such supersonic flow encounters a shock and becomes subsonic again .",
    "such subsonic matter has to pass through another saddle type sonic point to meet the aforesaid inner boundary condition . for accretion onto black hole , presence of at least two saddle type _",
    "points are thus a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for the shock formation .",
    "multi - transonicity , thus , plays a crucial role in studying the physics of shock formation and related phenomena in connection to the black hole accretion processes .",
    "one also expects that a shock formation in black - hole accretion discs might be a general phenomenon because shock waves in rotating astrophysical flows potentially provide an important and efficient mechanism for conversion of a significant amount of the gravitational energy into radiation by randomizing the directed infall motion of the accreting fluid .",
    "hence , the shocks play an important role in governing the overall dynamical and radiative processes taking place in astrophysical fluids and plasma accreting onto black holes .",
    "the hot and dense post shock flow is considered to be a powerful diagnostic tool in understanding various astrophysical phenomena like the spectral properties of the galactic black hole candidates @xcite and that of the supermassive black hole at our galactic centre @xcite , the formation and dynamics of accretion powered galactic and extra - galactic outflows @xcite , shock induced nucleosynthesis in the black hole accretion disc and the metalicity of the intergalactic matter ( @xcite and references therein ) , and the origin of the quasi - periodic oscillation in galactic sources ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the study of steady , standing , stationary shock waves produced in black hole accretion and related phenomena thus acquired an important status in recent years (  @xcite ) .",
    "however , since for the same set of initial boundary conditions describing the multi - transonic accretion , there exist flow profiles which may or may not accommodate shock solutions , the very existence of accretion flow with shock is still a matter of debate to the astrophysical community involved in the study of the theory of black hole accretion disc .    this present treatment",
    "_ confirms _ , using a much broader and more comprehensive procedure in its scope and objectives than those reported previously in the literature , that the shock _ is _ an integral part of the black hole axisymmetric accretion in its most generic form , i.e. , for the general relativistic accretion disc in the kerr metric . in the present paper",
    "we study the sequence of the stationary axisymmetric solutions characterized by the angular momentum paying attention to the changes of the flow topology in the extended velocity phase space diagram . by the phrase ` extended velocity phase diagram ' , here",
    "we mean the two dimensional graphical representation where the radial mach number has been plotted along the ordinate and the radial distance has been plotted along the abscissa . the radial mach number is the ratio of the radial velocity measured on the equatorial plane of the accretion disc , and the height averaged polytropic sound speed defined on the equatorial plane of the disc .",
    "the radial distance has been measured from the black hole along the equatorial plane , and is scaled in the units of @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the universal gravitational constant and @xmath17 is the mass of the black hole considered , @xmath16 and @xmath12 have been scaled to be unity in the system of geometrical unit .",
    "we discuss in detail the critical solution which divides the family of compact transonic flows ( solutions with sonic point at the innermost critical point ) from extended transonic flows ( solutions with sonic point at the outermost critical point ) .",
    "we argue that the existence of this critical solution is likely to lead to a hysteresis effect when the system chooses the solution with , or without a shock , depending on the flow history .",
    "in addition , we have proposed a lyapunov like treatment , to show that the likelihood of the event that a shock will form or not , clearly depends on the value of such effective lyapunov index .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows :    in the next section , we will describe the overall flow configuration , and the corresponding governing equations will be derived , solution of which , along with a detailed discussion of the transonic properties arising out of such solutions , will be provided in the section [ section3 ] section [ section4 ] and [ section5 ] will elaborate the multi - transonic behaviour of such flow . in section [ section6 ]",
    "we will describe certain ` hysteresis effects ' corresponding to the secular evolution of the flow .",
    "section [ section7 ] will illustrate the details of an lyapunov like treatment for the state transition in transonic accretion solution to establish what prompts a multi - transonic accretion to ( or not to ) contain a standing shock solution .",
    "finally we conclude in the section [ section8 ] .",
    "to provide a generic description of axisymmetric fluid flow in strong gravity , one needs to solve the equations of motion for the fluid and the einstein equations . as of our present ( limited ) understanding about the detail physics of the black hole accretion flow",
    "is concerned , this seems to be an enormously difficult , if not impossible , task to accomplish .",
    "the problem may be made relatively tractable by assuming the accretion to be non - self gravitating so that the fluid dynamics may be dealt in a metric without back - reactions .",
    "the most general form of the energy momentum tensor for such non self gravitating compressible hydromagnetic astrophysical fluid ( with a frozen in magnetic field ) vulnerable to the shear , bulk viscosity and generalized energy exchange , may be expressed as @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the fluid ( matter ) part and the maxwellian ( electromagnetic ) part of the energy momentum tensor . @xmath19 and @xmath20 may be expressed as : @xmath21 in the above expression , @xmath22 is the total mass energy density excluding the frozen - in magnetic field mass energy density as measured in the local rest frame of the baryons ( local orthonormal frame , hereafter lrf , in which there is no net baryon flux in any direction ) .",
    "@xmath23 is the anisotropic pressure for incompressible gas ( had it been the case that @xmath24 would be zero ) . @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the co - efficient of bulk viscosity and of dynamic viscosity , respectively . hence @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the bulk viscosity and the viscous shear stress , respectively .",
    "@xmath29 is the energy and momentum flux , respectively , in lrf of the baryons . in the expression for @xmath20 , @xmath30 in the first term",
    "represents the energy density , in the second term represents the magnetic pressure orthogonal to the magnetic field lines , and in third term magnetic tension along the field lines ( all terms expressed in lrf ) , respectively .    here",
    ", the electromagnetic field may be described by the field tensor @xmath31 and it s dual @xmath32 ( obtained from @xmath31 using levi - civita totally antisymmetric tensor @xmath33 ) satisfying the maxwell equations through the vanishing of the four - divergence of @xmath32 . a complete description of flow behaviour could thus be obtained by taking the co - variant derivative of @xmath34 and @xmath35 to obtain the energy momentum conservation equations and the conservation of baryonic mass .",
    "however , at this stage , the complete solution remains analytically untenable unless we are compelled to adopt a number of simplified approximations .",
    "our work concentrates on the inviscid accretion of hydrodynamic fluid .",
    "hence @xmath34 may be described by the standard form of the energy momentum ( stress - energy ) tensor of a perfect fluid : @xmath36 our calculation will thus be focused on the stationary axisymmetric solution of the energy momentum and baryon number conservation equations @xmath37 specifying the metric to be stationary and axially symmetric , the two generators @xmath38 and @xmath39 of the temporal and axial isometry , respectively , are killing vectors .    to describe the flow ,",
    "it is advisable to use the boyer - lindquist co - ordinate @xcite , and an azimuthally lorentz boosted orthonormal tetrad basis co - rotating with the accreting fluid . at this stage",
    "we are not interested in non - axisymmetric disc structure , hence we neglect any gravo - magneto - viscous non - alignment between the flow angular momentum and the black hole spin angular momentum .",
    "we consider inviscid accretion and denote the constant specific flow angular momentum to be @xmath40 .",
    "hence , while describing the accretion disc dynamics , the viscous transport of the angular momentum has not explicitly been taken into account .",
    "viscosity , however , is quite a subtle issue in studying the disc accretion .",
    "even thirty six years after the discovery of standard accretion disc theory @xcite , exact modeling of viscous transonic black - hole accretion , including proper heating and cooling mechanisms , is still quite an arduous task , even for a newtonian flow , let alone for general relativistic accretion .",
    "nevertheless , extremely large radial velocity close to the black hole implies @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the infall and the viscous time scales , respectively .",
    "large radial velocities even at larger distances are due to the fact that the angular momentum content of the accreting fluid is relatively low @xcite .",
    "hence , the assumption of inviscid flow is not unjustified from an astrophysical point of view .",
    "however , one of the most significant effects of the introduction of viscosity would be the reduction of the angular momentum . in our work",
    ", it has been observed that the location of the sonic points anti - correlates with @xmath40 , i.e. weakly rotating flow makes the dynamical velocity gradient steeper , which indicates that for viscous flow the sonic horizons will be pushed further out and the flow would become supersonic at a larger distance for the same set of other initial boundary conditions .",
    "also we found how the shock location ( and strength , and other related variables ) get modified because of the variation of the flow angular momentum .",
    "hence in our work , we practically have demonstrated the effect of viscosity as well .",
    "we consider the flow to be ` advective ' , i.e. to possess considerable radial three - velocity .",
    "the above - mentioned advective velocity , which we hereafter denote by @xmath44 and consider it to be confined on the equatorial plane , is essentially the three - velocity component perpendicular to the set of hypersurfaces @xmath45 defined by @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the magnitude of the 3-velocity .",
    "each @xmath48 is timelike since its normal @xmath49 is spacelike and may be normalized as @xmath50 .",
    "we then define the specific angular momentum @xmath40 and the angular velocity @xmath51 as @xmath52    the metric on the equatorial plane is given by ( @xcite ) @xmath53 where @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , @xmath56 being the kerr parameter related to the black - hole spin .",
    "the normalization condition @xmath57 , together with the expressions for @xmath40 and @xmath51 in ( [ eq89 ] ) , provides the relationship between the advective velocity @xmath44 and the temporal component of the four velocity @xmath58^{1/2 } .",
    "\\label{eq91}\\ ] ] in order to solve ( [ eq88 ] ) , we need to specify a realistic equation of state . in this work ,",
    "we concentrate on polytropic accretion , and some relevant details of the flow thermodynamics is presented in the next section .    it is to be noted here that the use of the polytropic equation of state in describing the thermodynamic properties of the accreting matter is quite common in the theory of relativistic black hole accretion .",
    "however , one also understands that the polytropic accretion is not the only choice to describe such accretion .",
    "equations of state other than the adiabatic one , such as the isothermal equation  @xcite or the two - temperature plasma  @xcite , have also been used to for this purpose .",
    "the polytropic equation is taken to be of the following form @xmath59 where the polytropic index @xmath60 ( equal to the ratio of the two specific heats @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) of the accreting material is assumed to be constant throughout the fluid .",
    "a more realistic model of the flow would perhaps require a variable polytropic index having a functional dependence on the radial distance , i.e. of the functional form @xmath63 ; see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein for further discussions .",
    "however , we have performed the calculations for a sufficiently large range of @xmath60 and we believe that all astrophysically relevant polytropic indices are covered in our analysis .    the constant @xmath64 in ( [ eq92 ] ) may be related to the specific entropy of the fluid , provided there is no entropy generation in the flow .",
    "if in addition to ( [ eq92 ] ) the clapeyron equation for an ideal gas holds @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the locally measured temperature , @xmath67 the mean molecular weight , @xmath68 the mass of the hydrogen atom , then the specific entropy , i.e. the entropy per particle , is given by  @xcite : @xmath69 where the constant depends on the chemical composition of the accreting material .",
    "equation ( [ eq94 ] ) confirms that @xmath64 in ( [ eq92 ] ) is a measure of the specific entropy of the accreting matter .",
    "the specific enthalpy of the accreting matter can now be defined as @xmath70 where the energy density @xmath71 includes the rest - mass density and the internal energy and may be written as @xmath72 the adiabatic speed of sound is defined by @xmath73 from ( [ eq96 ] ) we obtain @xmath74 combination of ( [ eq97 ] ) and ( [ eq92 ] ) gives @xmath75 using the above relations , one obtains the expression for the specific enthalpy @xmath76 the rest - mass density @xmath77 , the pressure @xmath78 , the temperature @xmath66 of the flow and the energy density @xmath71 may be expressed in terms of the speed of sound @xmath10 as @xmath79 @xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath82 .",
    "\\label{eq104}\\ ] ]    we now need to define a specific geometrical structure of the disc , which has been done in the next section .",
    "we assume that the disc has a radius - dependent local thickness @xmath83 , and its central plane coincides with the equatorial plane of the black hole .",
    "it is a standard practice in accretion disc theory ( @xcite and many others ) to use the vertically averaged model in describing the black - hole accretion discs where the equations of motion apply to the equatorial plane of the black hole .",
    "we follow the same procedure here .",
    "the thermodynamic flow variables are averaged over the disc height , i.e. , a thermodynamic quantity @xmath84 used in our model is vertically averaged over the disc height as + @xmath85 we follow @xcite to derive an expression for the disc height @xmath83 in our flow geometry since the relevant equations in @xcite are non - singular on the horizon and can accommodate both the axial and a quasi - spherical flow geometry . in the newtonian framework , the disc height in vertical equilibrium is obtained from the @xmath86 component of the non - relativistic euler equation where all the terms involving velocities and the higher powers of @xmath87 are neglected . in the case of a general relativistic disc , the vertical pressure gradient in the comoving frame",
    "is compensated by the tidal gravitational field .",
    "we then obtain the disc height @xmath88 ^{\\frac{1}{2 } } , \\label{eq105}\\ ] ] which , by making use of ( [ eq91 ] ) , may be be expressed in terms of the advective velocity @xmath44 .",
    "from analytical perspective , problems in black hole accretion fall under the general class of nonlinear dynamics @xcite , since accretion describes the dynamics of a compressible astrophysical fluid , governed by a set of nonlinear differential equations .",
    "physical transonic solutions can be mathematically realized as critical solutions in the phase portrait of the flow .",
    "to obtain such critical solutions , it is first convenient to construct a set of first integrals of motion .",
    "the temporal component of the energy momentum tensor conservation equation leads to the constancy of the total specific energy of the accretion flow along each streamline of the flow .",
    "this specific energy is denoted by @xmath89 ( which actually is the relativistic analogue of the bernoulli s constant , and can be expressed in terms of the flow enthalpy and @xmath90 , as @xmath91 , see @xcite for further detail ) , and hence from ( [ eq91 ] ) and ( [ eq100 ] ) it follows that : @xmath92 \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{1-u^{2}}\\right ) \\left [ \\frac{ar^{2}\\delta}{a^{2}-4\\lambda ara + \\lambda^{2}r^{2}(4a^{2}-r^{2}\\delta ) } \\right ] } \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq107}\\ ] ] the rest - mass accretion rate @xmath93 is obtained by integrating the relativistic continuity equation .",
    "one finds @xmath94 here , we adopt the sign convention that a positive @xmath44 corresponds to accretion .",
    "the entropy accretion rate @xmath95 can be expressed as : @xmath96 ^{\\left ( \\frac{1}{\\gamma -1 } \\right ) } h(r ) \\label{eq109}\\ ] ] one can solve the conservation equations for @xmath97 and @xmath95 to obtain the complete accretion profile .",
    "we thus have two primary first integrals of motion along the streamline  the specific energy of the flow @xmath89 and the mass accretion rate @xmath93 . even in the absence of creation or annihilation of matter ,",
    "the entropy accretion rate @xmath95 is not a generic first integral of motion . as the expression for @xmath95 contains the quantity @xmath98 , which is a measure of the specific entropy of the flow , the entropy accretion rate @xmath95 remains constant throughout the flow only if the entropy per particle remains locally invariant .",
    "this condition may be violated if the accretion is accompanied by a shock .",
    "thus @xmath95 is conserved for shock free polytropic accretion ( and wind ) and becomes discontinuous ( actually , increases ) at the shock location , if such a shock is formed .",
    "however , @xmath95 is of utmost importance for our purpose , since it acts as the degeneracy remover for the multi - critical accretion , see subsequent discussions for further detail .",
    "being equipped with the disc geometry and the integrals of motion , we will now discuss the transonicity of the flow in the next section .",
    "the gradient of the acoustic velocity can be computed by differentiating ( [ eq109 ] ) and can be obtained as : @xmath99 \\label{eq110a}\\ ] ] the dynamical velocity gradient can then be calculated by differentiating ( [ eq107 ] ) with the help of ( [ eq110a ] ) as : @xmath100 -    \\frac{\\chi}{2 } } { \\displaystyle{\\frac{u}{\\left(1-u^2\\right ) } -    \\frac{2c_{s}^2 } { \\left(\\gamma+1\\right ) \\left(1-u^2\\right ) u }     \\left [ 1-\\frac{u^2v_{t}\\sigma}{2\\psi } \\right ] } } , % = \\frac{{\\cal n}}{{\\cal d } } \\label{eq110}\\ ] ] where ( see @xcite for further detail ) : @xmath101 a real physical transonic flow must be smooth everywhere , except possibly at a shock .",
    "hence , if the denominator of the equation ( [ eq110 ] ) vanishes at a point ( for certain value of @xmath4 ) , the numerator must also vanish at that point to ensure the physical continuity of the flow .",
    "one thus arrives at a critical point ( or the fixed point / equilibrium point  by borrowing the terminology used in the theory of dynamical systems ) conditions by simultaneously making the numerator and the denominator equal to zero .",
    "the critical point conditions can thus be obtained as : @xmath102^{1/2}_{\\vc }   } , ~~u{\\vc}= { \\left[\\frac{\\chi\\delta r } { 2r\\left(r-1\\right)+ 4\\delta } \\right ] ^{1/2}_{\\rm r = r_c }   } , \\label{eq112}\\ ] ] for any value of , substitution of the values of @xmath103 and @xmath104 in terms of @xmath105 in the expression for @xmath89 ( [ eq107 ] ) , provides a polynomial in @xmath105 , the solution of which determines the location of the critical point(s ) @xmath105 .",
    "it is obvious from ( [ eq112 ] ) that @xmath106 , and hence the mach number at the critical point is _ not _ equal to unity in general .",
    "this phenomena can more explicitly be demonstrated for relativistic disc accretion onto a schwarzschild black hole . for schwarzschild metric",
    ", we calculate the mach number of the flow at the critical point as @xmath107 where @xmath108 clearly , @xmath109 is generally not equal to unity , and for @xmath110 , is always less than one , and it can easily be shown that for a realistic choice of initial boundary conditions , the separation between the critical and the sonic points can be as high as several hundred gravitational radii . .",
    "hence , the sonic points are _ not _ isomorphic to the critical points in general , neither numerically , nor topologically , and we categorically distinguish a sonic point from a critical point . in the literature on transonic black - hole accretion discs ,",
    "the concepts of critical and sonic points are often made identical by erroneously defining an ` effective ' sound speed leading to the ` effective ' mach number ( for further details , see , eg .",
    "@xcite ) for an ` effective ' geometry . for realistic flow in general relativity",
    ", the exact sonic condition should be obtained for at the location where the bulk flow velocity has to match the local unscaled speed of propagation of the acoustic perturbation .",
    "we thus strongly disagree to accept the synonymous use of the terms critical and sonic points for the following reasons :    in the existing literature on non general relativistic pseudo - schwarzschild transonic disc accretion , the mach number at the critical point turns out to be a function of @xmath60 only , and hence @xmath109 remains constant if @xmath60 is constant .",
    "for example , use of the @xcite pseudo - schwarzschild potential to describe the adiabatic accretion phenomena leads to ( see @xcite , and references therein for further details of such calculation ) @xmath111 the above expression does not depend on the location of the critical point and depends only on the value of the adiabatic index chosen to describe the flow .",
    "note that for isothermal accretion @xmath112 , and hence the sonic points and the critical points are identical .",
    "however , the quantity @xmath109 in eq .",
    "( [ eq115 ] ) as well as when calculated for ( [ eq112 ] ) , is clearly a function of @xmath105 , and hence , generally , it takes different values for different @xmath105 for transonic accretion .",
    "the mach numbers at the critical ( saddle type ) points are thus _ functional _ , and not functions , of the initial boundary conditions .",
    "the difference between the radii of the critical point and the sonic point may be quite significant .",
    "one defines the radial difference of the critical and the sonic point ( where the mach number is exactly equal to unity ) as @xmath113 the quantity @xmath114 may be a complicated function of , the form of which can not be expressed analytically , but it can easily be evaluated using numerical integrations , and we have done so .",
    "we estimate the @xmath114 can be as large as @xmath115 @xmath116 , or even more , for flow passing through the outer critical / sonic points .",
    "the radius @xmath5 in eq .",
    "( [ eq117 ] ) is the radius of the sonic point corresponding to the same for which the radius of the critical point @xmath105 is evaluated .",
    "note , however , that since @xmath5 is calculated by integrating the flow from @xmath105 upto the point where the mach number exactly becomes unity , @xmath114 is defined only for saddle - type critical points .",
    "a physically acceptable transonic solution can be constructed only through a saddle - type critical point , and not through a centre type critical point .",

    "we thus call such flow topologies as the ` mono - transonic accretion with an additional pair of critical points ' .",
    "it is to be noted that the above mentioned solutions are commonly known as the multi - transonic wind in the literature , owing to the fact that for a limited subset of values of @xmath176 $ ] taken from the region @xmath171 , the wind segment of the homoclinic orbit can be connected to the non homoclinic wind like solutions ( passing through the inner sonic point ) through a standing shock .",
    "however , we would not like to use such terminology here . such terminology , as we feel , is misleading in the sense that the wind solution have no role in studying the accretion phenomena ( except , perhaps , for studying the accretion powered outflow ) , and hence the term ` multi - transonic wind ' sounds as if there is no accretion taking place for the initial boundary conditions chose from the region @xmath171 , and such nomenclature is of compromised clarity only .",

    "this requires numerical integration of the equations describing the velocity gradient , as well as the gradient of the acoustic velocity , of the accretion flow .",
    "one thus needs to define the value of both the velocity gradients at the critical point , pick up the required quantities ( the value of the dynamical and the acoustic velocities , and their respective gradients at the critical point , and of the critical point itself ) , and to use those values as the starting values for the integration , like what is to be done in case of the standard initial value problem corresponding to the numerical solution of the differential equation .    to obtain the dynamical velocity gradient at the critical point , one applies lhospital s rule on ( [ eq110 ] ) .",

    "the topology of such a process is represented by the wind solution in the panel , which , as already been mentioned , is the curve intersecting the accretion branch ` acc ' at the outer critical point .    the above procedure for obtaining the flow topology is also applied to draw the mono - transonic accretion / wind branch through the inner sonic point . in fact , the same procedure may be used to draw real physical transonic accretion / wind solutions passing through any acceptable saddle - type critical point . note , however , that the sector of the accretion branch starting from the intersection of the accretion and the wind solution in the panel diagram and ending at the event horizon is _ not _ the complete subsonic branch , because the point of intersection is a critical point and not a sonic point .",

    "as we further process toward higher value of @xmath40 , the area enclosed within the homoclinic orbit starts increasing and finally it fills up the entire region bounded by the transonic accretion and wind passing through the outer critical point .",
    "the situations have been demonstrated sequentially in the successive panel figures ( iii ) , ( iv ) and ( v ) .      in panel ( iii ) , @xmath195 is 212.52 .",
    "shock , however , does not form even if three critical points are present . such multi - critical flow ( which is actually a mono - transonic accretion because in absence of the shock , accretion flow can pass only through the outer sonic point even if the inner sonic point formally exists ) without a standing shock is observed for a range of value of @xmath198 where @xmath199 , which defines the boundary of the @xmath177 region .",

    "the shock location , shock strength , in which is defined as the pre ( - ) to the post ( + ) shock ratio ( defined not in the temporal sequence but in the spatial sequence , of the mach number ) and is denoted by @xmath201 , and the entropy enhancement ratio at the shock @xmath195 are found to be 18.3336735 and 74.9621923 , respectively .",
    "it is to be noted that the panel ( iv ) is not the solution corresponding to the minimum value of @xmath40 for which the shock forms , i.e. , does not correspond to the value of @xmath40 separating the @xmath177 and the @xmath178 region .",
    "the strongest shock ( forms for the maximally allowed value of @xmath202 in @xmath178 ) are formed for @xmath203 where @xmath204 for example , for @xmath205 , the shock forms at 27.5@xmath116 , and the corresponding shock strength and the entropy enhancement ratio at the shock are found to be 41.7 and 197.62 , respectively .    the relativistic shock equations and its derivation , along with a detail description of the methodology of finding the multi - transonic flow with and without shock",
    "is presented in the subsequent paragraphs .",
    "however , from panel ( iii ) and ( iv ) , it is to be understood that shock does not necessarily form for all multi - critical flow . having two saddle type critical points is thus a necessary but not a sufficient condition .",
    "the reason behind this disparity will be analytically justified in the section ( [ section6 ] ) and section ( [ section7 ] )      using a specific set of , one first solves the equation for @xmath89 at the critical point to find out the corresponding three critical points , saddle type inner , centre type middle , and the saddle type outer .",
    "the space gradient of the flow velocity as well as the acoustic velocity at the saddle type critical point is then obtained .",
    "such @xmath206,@xmath207 and @xmath208 serve as the initial value condition for performing the numerical integration of the advective velocity gradient using the fourth - order runge - kutta method .",
    "such integration provides the outer _ sonic _ point ( located closer to the black hole compared to the outer critical point , since the mach number at the outer critical point is less than unity ) , the local advective velocity , the polytropic sound speed , the mach number , the fluid density , the disc height , the bulk temperature of the flow , and any other relevant dynamical and thermodynamic quantity characterizing the flow .",
    "the corresponding wind solution through the outer sonic point is obtained in the same way , by taking the other value ( note that being a quadratic algebraic equation , solution of ( [ eq113a ] ) provides two initial values , one for the accretion and the other for the wind ) of @xmath208 .    the respective accretion and",
    "the wind solutions passing through the inner critical point are obtained following exactly the same procedure as has been used to draw the accretion and wind topologies passing through the outer critical point .",
    "note , however , that the accretion solution through the inner critical point folds back onto the wind solution which is a homoclinic orbit through the inner critical point encompassing the centre type middle critical point .",
    "a physically acceptable transonic solution must be globally consistent , i.e. it must connect the radial infinity with the black - hole event horizon .",
    "hence , for multi - transonic accretion , there is no individual existence of physically acceptable accretion / wind solution passing through the inner critical ( sonic ) point , although , depending on the initial boundary conditions , such solution may be clubbed with the accretion solution passing through outer critical point , through a standing shock .",
    "the set @xmath139_{\\bf a}$ ] ( or more generally @xmath176_{\\bf a}$ ] ) thus produces doubly degenerate accretion / wind solutions .",
    "such two fold degeneracy may be removed by the entropy considerations since the entropy accretion rates for solutions passing through the inner critical point and the outer critical point are generally not equal . for any @xmath176{\\in } \\left[{\\cal e},\\lambda,\\gamma , a\\right]_{\\bf a}$ ] we find that the entropy accretion rate @xmath95 evaluated for the complete accretion solution passing through the outer critical point is less than that of the rate evaluated for the incomplete accretion / wind solution passing through the inner critical point . since the quantity @xmath95 is a measure of the specific entropy density of the flow , the solution passing through the outer critical point will naturally tend to make a transition to its higher entropy counterpart , i.e. the globally incomplete accretion solution passing through the inner critical point .",
    "hence , if there existed a mechanism for the accretion solution passing through the outer critical point to increase its entropy accretion rate exactly by an amount @xmath209 there would be a transition to the accretion solution passing through the inner critical point .",
    "such a transition would take place at a radial distance somewhere between the radius of the inner sonic point and the radius of the point of inflexion of the homoclinic orbit . in this way",
    "one would obtain a true multi - transonic accretion solution connecting the infinity and the event horizon , which includes a part of the accretion solution passing through the inner critical , and hence the inner sonic point .",
    "one finds that for some specific values of @xmath176_{\\bf a}$ ] , a standing rankine - hugoniot shock may accomplish this task .",
    "a supersonic accretion through the outer _ sonic _ point ( which in obtained by integrating the flow starting from the outer critical point ) can generate entropy through such a shock formation and can join the flow passing through the inner _ sonic _ point ( which in obtained by integrating the flow starting from the outer critical point ) .",
    "below we will carry on a detail discussion on such shock formation .      in the present work ,",
    "the basic equations governing the flow are the energy and baryon number conservation equations which contain no dissipative terms and the flow is assumed to be inviscid .",
    "hence , the shock which may be produced in this way can only be of rankine - hugoniot type which conserves energy .",
    "the shock thickness must be relatively small in this case , otherwise non - dissipative flows may radiate energy through the upper and the lower boundaries because of the presence of strong temperature gradient in between the inner and outer boundaries of the shock thickness . in the presence of a shock",
    "the flow may have the following profile .",
    "a subsonic flow starting from infinity first becomes supersonic after crossing the outer sonic point and somewhere in between the outer sonic point and the inner sonic point the shock transition takes place and forces the solution to jump onto the corresponding subsonic branch .",
    "the hot and dense post - shock subsonic flow produced in this way becomes supersonic again after crossing the inner sonic point and ultimately dives supersonically into the black hole .",
    "a flow heading towards a neutron star can have the liberty of undergoing another shock transition after it crosses the inner sonic point . or , alternatively , a shocked flow heading towards a neutron star need not encounter the inner sonic point at all .",
    "this is because , the hard surface boundary condition of a neutron star by no means prevents the flow from hitting the star surface subsonically .",
    "for the complete general relativistic accretion flow discussed in this article , the energy momentum tensor @xmath34 , the four - velocity @xmath210 , and the speed of sound @xmath10 may have discontinuities at a hypersurface @xmath211 with its normal @xmath212 . using the energy momentum conservation and the continuity equation , we have : @xmath213\\right ] { \\eta}_{\\mu}=0 , \\left[\\left[{\\large\\sf t}^{\\mu\\nu}\\right]\\right]{\\eta}_{\\nu}=0 . \\label{eqa51}\\ ] ] for a perfect fluid , we thus formulate the relativistic rankine - hugoniot conditions as @xmath214\\right]=0 , \\label{eqa52}\\ ] ] @xmath215\\right]= \\left[\\left[(p+\\epsilon)v_t u\\gamma_{u } \\right]\\right]=0 , \\label{eqa53}\\ ] ] @xmath216\\right]= \\left[\\left[(p+\\epsilon)u^2\\gamma_{u}^2+p \\right]\\right]=0 , \\label{eqa54}\\ ] ] where @xmath217 is the lorentz factor .",
    "the first two conditions ( [ eqa52 ] ) and ( [ eqa53 ] ) are trivially satisfied owing to the constancy of the specific energy and mass accretion rate .",

    "( [ eqa55 ] ) and ( [ eqa56 ] ) yields the ` shock invariant ' quantity @xmath220 which changes continuously across the shock surface .",
    "we obtain the analytical expression for @xmath220 in terms of various local accretion variables and initial boundary conditions .",
    "the shock location in multi - transonic accretion is found in the following way . while performing the numerical integration along the solution passing through the outer critical point , we calculate the shock invariant @xmath221 in addition to @xmath44 , @xmath10 and @xmath0 .",
    "we also calculate @xmath221 while integrating along the solution passing through the inner critical point , starting from the inner _ sonic _ point up to the point of inflexion of the homoclinic orbit .",
    "we then determine the radial distance @xmath222 , where the numerical values of @xmath221 , obtained by integrating the two different sectors described above , are equal .",
    "generally , for any value of allowing shock formation , one finds two formal shock locations , one located in between the outer and the middle sonic point and the other one located in between the inner and the middle sonic point .",
    "the shock strength is different for the inner and for the outer shock . according to the standard local stability analysis ( @xcite ) , for a multi - transonic accretion",
    ", one can show that only the shock formed between the middle and the outer sonic point is stable .",
    "hereafter , whenever we mention the shock location , we always refer to the stable shock location only .",
    "we find that the shock location correlates with @xmath40 .",
    "this is obvious because the higher the flow angular momentum , the greater the rotational energy content of the flow . as a consequence , the strength of the centrifugal barrier which is responsible to break the incoming flow by forming a shock will be higher and",
    "the location of such a barrier will be farther away from the event horizon .",
    "however , the shock location anti - correlates with @xmath89 and @xmath60 .",
    "this means that for the same @xmath89 and @xmath40 , in the purely non - relativistic flow the shock will form closer to the black hole compared with the ultra - relativistic flow .",
    "besides , we find that the shock strength anti - correlates with the shock location @xmath222 , which indicates that the closer to the black hole the shock forms , the higher the strength and the entropy enhancement ratio are . the ultra - relativistic flows are supposed to produce the strongest shocks .",
    "the reason behind this is also easy to understand .",
    "the closer to the black hole the shock forms , the higher the available gravitational potential energy must be released , and the radial advective velocity required to have a more vigorous shock jump will be larger . besides we note that as the flow gradually approaches its purely non - relativistic limit , the shock may form for lower and lower angular momentum , which indicates that for purely non - relativistic accretion , the shock formation may take place even for a quasi - spherical flow .",
    "however , it is important to mention that a shock formation will be allowed not for every @xmath176{\\in } \\left[{\\cal e},\\lambda,\\gamma , a\\right]_{\\bf a}$ ] , the numerical value for @xmath220 will be the same along both the accretion through the outer and the inner sonic point , only at certain points ( the shock locations ) for a specific subset of @xmath176_{\\bf a}$ ] , for which a steady , standing shock solution will be found .",
    "we further find that the shock location correlates with the black hole spin parameter , whereas the shock strength and the entropy enhancement ratio at the shock anti correlates with the kerr parameter .",
    "the post to pre shock velocity correlates with the black hole spin , whereas the post to pre shock temperature , density and pressure anti correlates with the kerr parameter .",
    "as we further increase @xmath40 , the shock location recedes outward , and the shock strength as well as @xmath195 decreases monotonically",
    ". meanwhile , the homoclinic path embracing the middle critical point starts filling up the entire region accessible to it .",
    "finally , when @xmath40 approaches the value @xmath223 , the interface between the a and the @xmath136 regions is approached , and one obtains the characteristic phase portrait as that of panel ( v ) .    the above mentioned line of interface , as has already been discussed , represents the state where the entropy accretion rate for solution passing through the inner critical point is exactly the same for the solution passing through the outer critical point .",
    "integral curves on the phase portrait are allowed to intersect only at the critical points .",
    "hence two saddle points in this case will be connected through _",
    "heteroclinic orbits_. a heteroclinic orbit is generally a trajectory on a two dimensional phase portrait which connects one saddle type equilibrium points to the other saddle type equilibrium point . if the two saddle points are the same , then it becomes a homoclinic orbit .",
    "existence of the heteroclinic orbit is associated with the stability issues in the dynamical systems of a two dimensional vector field ( velocity filed , for example ) .",
    "a heteroclinic orbit is contained in the stable manifold of one saddle point and in the unstable manifold of the other saddle point . a fundamental fact arising from the theory of the structural stability",
    "is that if two saddle type critical points are connected through the heteroclinic orbit , then the local phase portrait near this orbit can be changed by an arbitrarily small smooth perturbation . in effect",
    ", a perturbation can be chosen such that , in the phase portrait of the perturbed vector field , the saddle connection is broken .",
    "thus , in particular , a vector field with two saddle points connected by a heteroclinic orbit is not structurally stable with respect to the class of all smooth vector fields ( @xcite ) .",
    "drawing the phase portrait for the above mentioned topology will entail the tuning of the flow parameters ( and the initial boundary conditions ) with infinite numerical precession .",
    "the solution topology looks like a fish , which has an asymmetrically placed hunch on its back .",
    "the collection of all the @xmath120 $ ] pair , for which such ` fish topologies ' are produced , is thus a line characterizing the condition of the heteroclinicity .",
    "a further increase of @xmath40 allows to enter in the @xmath136 region . a representative diagram for such flow topology",
    "is shown in the panel ( vi ) .",
    "the converse behaviour ( compared to the multi - transonic accretion ) of the phase portrait for multi - transonic accretion ) is quite obvious . here",
    "the governing principle , as already been mentioned in sect .",
    "[ subsection4.4 ] , is that the entropy accretion rate pertaining to the inner critical point is greater than that of the outer critical point , and hence the homoclinic orbit passes through the outer critical point .",
    "the topological flow profile for the present case is different from that of the multi - transonic accretion . here",
    "the homoclinic orbit passes through the outer critical point .",
    "the procedure for finding the complete flow topology with shock is essentially same as that for finding the complete topology of a true multi - transonic shocked accretion flow as mentioned earlier . to find the shock location , here one",

    "extremely strong shocks are found to form very close to the black hole ( on the off equatorial plane ) for this situation .",
    "we will show in our future work that such wind solutions with strong shocks are useful in explaining the grb light curves ( janiuk , czerny & das , in preparation ) .    for higher value of @xmath40 ,",
    "the homoclinic orbit through the outer critical point start shrinking , and finally disappear with pair - annihilation of the saddle type outer critical point and the centre type inner critical point once we cross the hypersurface separating the @xmath136 and the mono - transonic accretion ( passing only through the inner critical point ) zone .",

    "it is to be understood that the solutions with shock for the value of the flow angular momentum higher than @xmath224 are of completely different character compared to the solution parametrized by the value of angular momentum lower than @xmath224 .",

    "one is along the flow passing through @xmath228 , to obtain @xmath229 for the multi - transonic flow .",
    "another option is to compute the density @xmath232 along the multi - transonic accretion flow passing through the inner sonic point @xmath233 .",
    "both @xmath229 and @xmath232 can be calculated as a function of @xmath40 for the span @xmath234 . however , since for the span @xmath235 shock does not form , @xmath232 is a meaningless quantity to define for this span of @xmath40 , and thus for any value of the angular momentum upto @xmath236 , density at @xmath226 means @xmath229 only .",

    "hence the measured density at @xmath226 for @xmath239 implies @xmath232 only .",
    "hence , we have @xmath229 defined over the range for any value of the flow angular momentum upto @xmath240 , and , on the contrary , @xmath232 is defined only over the range @xmath241 . in figure 3 , we plot , in logarithmic scale , @xmath229 using the solid line ( red coloured in the online edition ) and @xmath232 using the solid line ( in the region iv ) and the dashed line ( in the region iii ) respectively , as a function of the specific flow angular momentum @xmath40 .",
    "the local density changes by a factor over 500 at @xmath224 which well illustrates the global quantitative change in the flow .",
    "however , when we add the solutions passing through the inner and the outer sonic points with a shock to the same plot , those solutions form a continuation of the previous branch below @xmath224 .",
    "the shock for @xmath40 just below @xmath224 is extremely weak ( with the corresponding shock strength having value very close to the unity ) , and located infinitesimally close inward of the outer critical point . with a further decrease of @xmath40 the shock strength measured as a ratio of the mach numbers above and below the shock increases monotonically , and the shock position moves inward .",
    "the branch with a shock also does not cover the whole range of angular momentum values  there is a minimum value of @xmath40 ( for a given bernoulli constant , the polytropic index and the black hole spin ) for which the rankine - hugoniot conditions ( see sect .",
    "[ subsection5.4 ] ) can be satisfied .",
    "this value , marked as @xmath203 in the section [ subsection5.3 ] , describes the discontinuous change in the solution along the branch with a shock with a further drop in the angular momentum , as for still lower values of @xmath40 only the solutions without shock exist . the local density change in the flow at @xmath242 accompanying the slight change of angular momentum along this branch is by a factor 4 , much less than the factor 500 at the transition at @xmath224 for the shock - free solutions .",
    "since the system is likely to choose a solution close to the previous one under the slight change of the outer boundary conditions ( here , the angular momentum ) , the choice between the solution with a shock and without a shock for @xmath243 will depend on the previous history of the system .",
    "if the initial value of the angular momentum is lower than @xmath203 and slowly increases the system will follow the lower branch ( @xmath229 ) in fig .",

    "if , on the other hand , the system evolution starts with @xmath245 and the angular momentum of the infalling material slowly decreases the system is more likely to follow the upper branch in fig .",
    "3 , without any discontinuity in the appearance down to @xmath203 but the solution will display an increasingly stronger shock with a quasi - stationary increase of the angular momentum of the matter .",
    "we thus expect a hysteresis effect in the system behavior under the conditions of slowly varying initial angular momentum of the accreting matter .",
    "this may in turn lead to some asymmetry in the lightcurves of the systems accreting in such a mode .",
    "the local density at @xmath246 is an indicator of the system luminosity ( the synchrotron emission increases with the plasma density and magnetic field ) .",
    "the increase in the local density indicates an increase in a source brightness .",
    "since the discontinuity in the density profile is larger when the angular momentum and consequently the density increases ( at @xmath224 ) the brightening should be faster / stronger than the subsequent faintenning of the source ( evolution along the upper branch ( @xmath232 ) in fig .",
    "3 , down to @xmath203 ) .",

    "this region has been marked as @xmath249 , and is bounded by the span of the specific angular momentum @xmath250 $ ] .",
    "one might raise the question about what dictates the flow not to make a shock transition even if the shocked flow can have the saddle type inner sonic point available to pass through .",
    "in other words , given all the favourable conditions , i.e. , the presence of two real physical sonic points , and a larger than one entropy accretion rate ratio for the flows passing through these sonic points ( with higher entropy accretion rate for the flow passing thorough the outer sonic point ) , what prohibits the rankine hugoniot condition to be satisfied , as it gets satisfied for the region @xmath251 ?",
    "in reality , no information can readily be obtained from the initial boundary conditions @xmath176 $ ] as well as the measure of the entropy accretion rate ( which , of course , is purely a function of @xmath176 $ ] , and hence , does not impose any additional condition ) which may provide some certain well defined conditions predicting about the validity of the rankine hugoniot conditions over certain region of the parameter space describing the multi - transonic accretion flow .    usual trends in the contemporary literature ( @xcite and references therein ) to explain the origin and the characteristic features of the @xmath249 region is to make hypothesis that the shock may become oscillatory in that region , in absence of the fine tuning condition of the entropy generation at the shock ( that the difference between the entropy accretion rate should exactly be equal to the excess amount of @xmath172 produced at the shock ) , and the region @xmath249 thus has been attributed to explain , in analogy with the results obtained from the full numerical time dependent simulation of the shocked axisymmetric flow ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , the formation of the quasi - periodic oscillation of the black hole candidates .",
    "this approach , however , is fundamentally inconsistent from the mathematical perspective .",
    "the parameter space corresponding to the formation of the @xmath249 region ( of _ any _ region of the parameter space shown in the figure 1 ) is obtained from a completely stationary configuration , where the mother equations have been constructed as a set of explicit time independent equations .",
    "the notion of the oscillation of the shock ( or the very phrase `oscillation ' itself ) is associated with the dynamical temporal evolution of the configuration governed by a set of full time dependent equations .",

    "the above issue prompted us to put forward a theoretical condition , which , within the framework of the stationary configuration , will be able to explain why the entire region of the multi - transonic accretion parameter space will not allow a stationary shock solution , and , instead , only a restricted part of the region will produce a shocked accretion flow .",
    "we propose a lyapunov like treatment of the transonic accretion solution , within a complete stationary framework , to accomplish the above task .",
    "it is not quite uncommon in the literature to reply on a lyapunov like treatment , within the configuration of a stationary set up which contains an equilibrium point ( the critical point ) to study the state transition of such systems , subjected to a small variation of the overall parameter space .",

    "we calculate , for a wide range of @xmath4 and @xmath298 , with @xmath4 lying close to the inner sonic point , that is , closer to the black hole in comparison to any ` anticipated ' artificial shock location , so as to calculate the @xmath266 for an ` artificial ' post shock flow ( had it been the case that the shock would , at all , form , which clearly does not , in reality ) .",
    "this procedure _ guarantees _ the consistency of checking the probability of two possible outcomes at a length scale where one can distinguish a shocked and a shock free solution . for all possible configurations",

    "it is interesting to note that the above lemma has one to one correspondence with our findings related to the hysteresis effect as described in the previous section .",
    "we thus define an independent quantity , within a framework of a purely stationary configuration , namely the effective lyapunov index @xmath266 , which , for the first time in literature , can analytically explain why one obtains shock free solutions even for a multi - critical flow configuration .",
    "in the present paper we study the topology of the low angular momentum flow onto a black hole as a function of the flow global parameters .",
    "such a study may indicate the behaviour of the time evolution of the flow seen as a sequence of quasi - stationary stages .    for a given set of other parameters ( the bernoulli constant , adiabatic index and the kerr parameter ) the change in the angular momentum of the flow ( determined by the outer boundary conditions ) leads to a sequence of solutions passing through two discontinuous changes in the flow topology , and consequently , in the flow local parameters .",
    "the discontinuity at @xmath224 corresponds to a heteroclinic solution ( a ` fish ' topology ) with a flow line connecting the inner and the outer critical points . as we argue in sect .",
    "[ section6 ] , the physical flow is likely to change discontinuously at @xmath224 if the angular momentum increases from @xmath244 to @xmath245 as a result of systematic secular evolution , and then solutions both for @xmath244 and @xmath244 do not develop a shock .",
    "however , if in the course of secular evolution the angular momentum decreases from @xmath245 to @xmath244 the systems evolves through @xmath224 without showing any discontinuous change but instead develops a shock , with the strength of the shock increasing with the @xmath305 ratio .",
    "the above mentioned finding has further been supported by a lyapunov like treatment of the state transition of the flow , as discussed in detail in sect .",
    "[ section7 ] .",
    "the discontinuity at @xmath203 corresponds to the minimum value of the angular momentum for which the solutions with shocks exist .",
    "it is likely to show up if the angular momentum systematically decreases , first from @xmath245 to @xmath244 ( following the branch with shocks ) and then down below @xmath306 .",
    "the solution must then change discontinuously to the one without a shock .",
    "the reverse evolution does not lead to discontinuity as the flow then proceeds as a shock - free solution continuously up to @xmath224 where it reaches the critical ` fish ' topology .",
    "the analytical study of the solution stability close to ` fish ' topology ( @xmath307 ) can not be performed since infinitesimal changes in the solution parameters lead to the arbitrarily large change in the flow parameters .",
    "the problem should be addressed through time - dependent dynamical simulations .",
    "the issue of the topological change in the flow is generic and not related to any specific choice of the other flow parameters .",
    "we will show in our next work ( das & czerny , in preparation ) that the ` fish ' topology always appears as a boundary between the inflow through the inner critical point and through the outer critical point , irrespective of the flow geometry ( as long as it contains some non zero angular momentum ) , the specific metric , and the choice of the equation of state .",
    "our discussion shows that both solutions with , and without a shock , are likely to be met in real sources accreting material with low angular momentum , and the actual choice of the solution by the system depends on the flow history",
    ".    if the accretion parameters in an astrophysical system are in the range somewhat broader than @xmath203 - @xmath224 and vary in time the system will show sudden rapid changes in the luminosity accompanying the sudden flow restucturization .",
    "we qualitatively predict the appearance of flares with more rapid increase of the luminosity ( when crossing from @xmath244 to @xmath245 ) followed by a slow decay ( evolution partially along the shock branch down to @xmath306 ) .",
    "quantitative estimates would require computations of the flow emissivity .",
    "the appearance of the homoclinic orbit on the phase portrait is not unique for the axisymmetric rotating flows only . for spherically symmetric accretion with self gravity and radiative processes incorporated into it @xcite",
    ", such homoclinic paths would also appear @xcite , making the spherically symmetric accretion to be a bi - critical flow .",
    "it appears that the emergence of a homoclinic orbit is due to the smooth decrement of the radial inflow velocity , due to the centrifugally supported barrier for rotating flow , while due to the radiative losses for the spherical accretion .    in this work ,",
    "we have used a relatively lower value of the kerr parameter ( @xmath122 ) as a representative one .",
    "this does not , by any means , limit the applicability of our methodology for the case of black holes possessing higher value of the spin angular momentum because the kerr parameter has been treated as a free parameter in our construction and any value of @xmath56 can easily be plugged in into our model set up .",
    "for example , we obtain consistent shock location for the value of @xmath56 as high as @xmath308 ( ad for values of @xmath60 other than 4/3 ) as well .",
    "we can , compute the shock location and all other shock related quantities in general as a function of the kerr parameter as well , and that has been presented in some other work ( barai et al . in preparation ) .",
    "some of the results presented in this paper may also apply to grb . in this event , modeled as a failed supernova",
    ", the star first collapses due to the fuel exhaustion , the collapse is halted close to the core ( at @xmath309 km ) and replaced by expansion .",
    "part of the stellar envelope is rejected but the neutrino cooling stops part of the material and subsequently the slow fallback stage takes place @xcite onto a newly formed compact object .",
    "this accretion stage of the long gamma - ray burst can be described within the frame of our model assuming that the angular momentum of the back falling envelope is not large . if the accretion flow proceeds through a solution with a shock , the shock - related periodic oscillations may in a natural way explain for example the fast optical variability of the naked - eye burst grb080319b @xcite .",
