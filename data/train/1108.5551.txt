    "topological solitons play an important role in many areas of physics .",
    "they can be beneficial , like the abrikosov vortices in type ii superconductors or unwanted like the dislocations in nematic liquid crystals .",
    "likewise , the creation and observation of topological solitons in bose - einstein condensates is nowadays routine in laboratories around the world .",
    "recent experimental observations have renewed interest in the types of models that can support topological solitons , and it is important to understand the basic properties and phenomenology of topological solitons in these models . theoretically , the possibility of the presence of skyrmion structures in certain materials has been known for long@xcite ( for a more recent work and references , see @xcite ) , and this has recently been experimentally verified at least in mnsi@xcite and fe@xmath0co@xmath1si @xcite .",
    "a newer theoretical discovery is the family of materials collectively known as topological insulators ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "the experimental observation of topological insulator phase in bi@xmath0sb@xmath2 @xcite , bi@xmath3se@xmath4@xcite and bi@xmath3te@xmath4@xcite confirmed these theoretical predictions and served to further add relevance to the basic research involving topological solitons .",
    "for the present work , perhaps the most interesting possibility is the discovery that frustrated magnetic materials may support topological insulator phases , where the wave - function in momentum - space is classified by the hopf invariant@xcite . as will be discussed below , when the system is described by the hopf charge",
    ", it will support knotted structures .",
    "knotted structures have a long history in physics .",
    "they were first considered by lord kelvin , who proposed in 1867 @xcite that atoms could be knotted tubes of ether .",
    "this idea did not yield a satisfactory atomic theory , but subsequently more realistic models have been proposed with potential for knotted structures .",
    "this has been done , for example , in the context of ferromagnets@xcite , bose - einstein condensates@xcite , and optics@xcite .",
    "a unifying feature of all these , in addition to the knotted structures , is that all these phenomena and their knots can be described by classical field theory .      in a field",
    "theoretical description the knot is not made of a rope in empty space but through the twisting of a globally defined vector field . here",
    "we will only consider the case in which the knottedness is characterized by the hopf charge .",
    "the minimal model with stable knotted structures seems to be the faddeev - skyrme model @xcite and it is believed that this model is contained within various models with immediate physical application , such as the two - component ginzburg - landau model modified with an additional ward like term . @xcite .    the physical carrier field in the faddeev - skyrme model is a smooth 3d unit vector field @xmath5 with @xmath6 .",
    "unit vector fields with such properties have been proposed to exist , e.g. , in super - fluid @xmath7he in its a - phase ( continuous unlocked vortex)@xcite and in ferromagnets@xcite . in order to be able to define the hopf charge it is also necessary that the vector field @xmath8 approaches the same value at all asymptotic directions : @xmath9 when @xmath10 ( asymptotic triviality ) .",
    "asymptotic triviality means that from the point of view of @xmath8 the euclidean space @xmath11 is topologically like the sphere @xmath12 and this allows one to define the hopf charge as an element of the homotopy class @xmath13 .",
    "a concrete hopfion vortex ring with hopf charge @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 , however , this configuration is not a solution for the equation of motion studied here .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath17 at infinity in any direction and also on the @xmath18-axis , while the preimage of @xmath19 , which is defined as the vortex core , is the ring @xmath20 .",
    "( vortex core ) ; blue line : the preimage of @xmath21 .",
    "the lines have been assigned compatible directions and their linking number can then be computed as explained in text .",
    "[ f : apu],width=226 ]    since the core is just a simple loop it does not explain the hopf charge . for that purpose",
    "we need to consider also the preimage - curve of some other value of @xmath8 and the linking of these two curves .",
    "let us for example consider the tubular iso - surface defined by @xmath22 and on it the curve that is the preimage of @xmath23 , see figure [ f : apu ] .",
    "the linking number of this curve with the core - line can now be computed using the standard rules of knot theory : if the top arrow can be aligned with the bottom arrow using a clockwise rotation , the crossing is assigned @xmath24 , for a counterclockwise rotation + 1 .",
    "the linking number is then @xmath25 of the sum of signed crossings . from figure",
    "[ f : apu ] we can see that there are two crossings of signature @xmath24 and therefore the hopf charge is @xmath14 .",
    "the hopf charge can also be computed by integrating a charge density : for the antisymmetric field @xmath26 one constructs the potential @xmath27 such that @xmath28 and then the hopf charge is given by @xmath29 a proof that these two methods give the same result is given in @xcite .      for the dynamics we use a variation of the skyrme model",
    "as proposed by faddeev in 1975@xcite , it is defined by the lagrangian @xmath30 d^3x,\\quad f_{\\mu\\nu}:={\\phi\\cdot\\partial_\\mu \\phi\\times\\partial_\\nu \\phi}.\\ ] ] note that in the static case we have the following scaling property : under the scaling @xmath31 the integrated kinetic term scales as @xmath32 while the integrated @xmath33 term scales as @xmath34 . thus according to the virial theorem nontrivial configurations",
    "will attain some fixed size determined by the _ dimensional _ coupling constant @xmath35 . in the computations reported below we used @xmath36 .",
    "a very important property of this model is that the energy is bounded from below@xcite and from above@xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 are some constants and @xmath39 the hopf charge .",
    "since the exponent of the charge is less than 1 it follows that configurations with higher hopf charge tend to form bound states rather than split into several charge 1 states .",
    "an intriguing question is the form of the minimum energy states with higher hopf charge .",
    "after some tentative works@xcite detailed taxonomy has been obtained by battye and sutcliffe@xcite and hietarinta and salo@xcite .",
    "the results follow very well@xcite the bound ( [ vk ] ) .",
    "it turns out that a twisted torus - like configuration ( similar to ( [ q1n ] ) ) is a minimum energy state only for @xmath40 @xcite , for higher charges linked or knotted configurations are found .",
    "the trefoil knot is persistently found for charge @xmath41 from a wide variety of initial states , even for long vortices.@xcite    we will next give the computational method and then describe the results for two dynamical studies : scattering head on collisions , and attractive and repulsive channel simulations inspired by the work of ward in @xcite .",
    "for scattering dynamics we used the lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) in the full 3 + 1-dimensional minkowski space - time ( with @xmath42 ) and the resulting euler - lagrange equations , derived with a lagrange multiplier to guarantee @xmath43 during evolution . the second order ( in time )",
    "equation was split into two first order equations for numerical computations .",
    "the spatial derivatives are discretized on @xmath44 points .",
    "the formulae are quite similar to those in @xcite .",
    "time evolution was computed using 4th order runge - kutta ( five stage low memory version@xcite ) .",
    "for scattering studies the computational lattice varied between @xmath45 and @xmath46 , but all the simulations used the same lattice constant @xmath47 . in the three - hopfion collisions the physical size of the grid was @xmath48 and in the double - collisions @xmath49 .",
    "the constant of courant - friedrichs - lewy like condition linking time and space discretization is @xmath50 .",
    "ward s channel simulations were computed in a lattice of @xmath46 unless otherwise noted ; the grid constant was still @xmath47 but @xmath51 .",
    "the courant instability was controlled by smoothing . for computational platform",
    "we used samrai@xcite .",
    "as our work progressed the significance of boundary condition became more and more clear and thus we have tried a variety of different methods and parameter configurations to minimize boundary errors .",
    "the presented two- and three - hopfions scatterings are calculated with dirichlet boundary conditions @xmath52 , and the ward s channel simulations with neumann boundary condition @xmath53 .",
    "furthermore , in the two- and three - hopfion scatterings we had a thin and mild absorption layer near the boundary in order to prevent radiation from reflecting and re - entering the scattering region .",
    "visualization of a vector field is problematic . since we can not plot the vector field at all points of the 3d space we chose to plot iso - surfaces determined by the value of the third component @xmath54 , often with @xmath55 , which is a narrow tube around the core .",
    "this tube is painted@xcite with color determined by the first two components of @xmath8 . for visualization platform we used visit@xcite .",
    "before analyzing specific scattering processes it is important to recall the possible elementary deformation processes . it was already noted above that it is not enough to consider only the core - line but also how the unit - vector field twists around it .",
    "in fact , the proper knot theoretical setting is to use _ framed links _ which can be realized as _ directed ribbons _",
    "( pre - images of line segments@xcite ) .",
    "this adds local information near the curve , e.g. , twisting around it .",
    "knot deformations correspond to ribbon deformations , which allow certain types of crossing and breaking , in which the hopf charge will nevertheless be conserved .",
    "examples of ribbon deformations can be seen in@xcite .",
    "we will now consider the scattering of low - charge `` un - knot '' hopfions in two different situations : three - body scattering on a fixed target with projectiles from left and right , and two - body scattering with impact parameter .",
    "the the individual hopfions ( minimum energy states ) were first created using the steepest descent method ( corresponding to 1st order dissipative dynamics with a fictitious time ) @xcite .",
    "these hopfions were then rotated , lorentz boosted and combined to form the initial configurations for scattering .",
    "this was done using interpolation routines provided by the scipy python library .    in the first scattering process , for which snapshots are given in figure [ f1 ] , with full details in http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkhctrp6s_y[movie s1 ]",
    ", we have two charge @xmath56 hopfions approaching a stationary @xmath57 target head on , from left and right .",
    "the moving hopfions were lorentz boosted numerically to speeds @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively , and then immersed into the computational box . since the total charge is @xmath60 we expect the result to be a trefoil knot .",
    "this is indeed the case , after several intermediate steps .",
    "the resulting trefoil is not stationary but rather oscillates and rotates , and eventually the hopfion settles down drifting slowly .",
    "since @xmath61 there is theoretically 24% excess energy , some of which will radiate as low amplitude , close to vacuum ( @xmath62 ) , waves from the scattering region .",
    "these are not visible at the iso - surface @xmath55 level .",
    "the resulting drift is probably due to momentum conservation in an asymmetric radiation background .",
    "hopfions with velocities @xmath63 on a stationary @xmath57 target . for more details see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkhctrp6s_y[movie s1].[f1],width=332 ]    in figures [ f4],[f5 ] ( for details see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3x2ns8akble[movies s2 ] and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywwla0sdaqo[s3 ] ) we have a situation similar to the one in figure [ f1 ] , except that now the central target has charge @xmath64 .",
    "the total charge is then @xmath14 and indeed the final state has one hopfion of @xmath14 .",
    "as the hopfions approach each other they deform by the rule `` like colors attract '' , thereby preparing for ribbon crossings . since @xmath65 most of the energy has to radiate away .",
    "this can be clearly seen in figure [ f5 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywwla0sdaqo[movie s3 ] ) which describes in further detail the later stages of the process . in this figure",
    "we have indicated the distribution of energy density by a white cloud . up to @xmath66",
    "the energy is localized near the vortex tube but when the deformation towards @xmath14 continues more radiation is released and can be seen to radiate away .     and velocities @xmath67 , respectively , resulting with a hopfion of charge @xmath24 .",
    "for details see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3x2ns8akble[movie s2 ] .",

    "s4 ) ] we have the impact parameter @xmath68 and the hopfions have speed @xmath69 .",
    "although the hopfions touch briefly at @xmath70 the speed and distance prevent a bound state from forming .",
    "the individual hopfions just continue tumbling along a slightly bent trajectory .    for the same speeds but with slightly smaller impact parameter value @xmath71 the result",
    "is entirely different ( figure [ f3 ] , http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqidqwaqjow[movie s5 ] ) . for a moment",
    "it seems that the hopfions would again continue along their individual trajectories but there is just enough time to form an elongated loop .",
    "after this the evolution is typical for the total charge @xmath72 case : the loop behaves like an over - twisted rubber band and proceeds to make one ribbon crossing deformation to reach the linked loop configuration that is standard for this hopf charge .",
    "the linked configuration continues to rotate and oscillate .    .",
    "the initial velocities were @xmath73 and the impact parameter @xmath68 . for more details",
    "see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrw1z81i4hq[movie s4 ] .",
    "[ f2],width=332 ]     except that impact parameter is @xmath71 . for more details",
    "see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqidqwaqjow[movie s5 ] .",
    "[ f3],width=332 ]    the above results illustrate the difficulty associated with trying to make any generalizations about the behavior of hopfions .",
    "however , some progress has been made by modeling hopfions with elastic rods@xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to see if the elastic rod model could be extended to approximate dynamical features as well .",
    "we will next consider the case of two unit charge hopfion unknots placed on static positions not too far from each other .",
    "this case was studied by ward @xcite , who observed ( using energy minimization ) that under symmetry preserving relaxation an axisymmetric two hopfion state reaches a local minimum ( @xmath74 ) where the soliton cores around the symmetry axis are separated by a nonzero but finite distance .",
    "he also noticed that this separated configuration has @xmath75 higher total energy than the twice wound multisoliton state ( @xmath76 ) both of which are in the same homotopy class .",
    "the nature of the axisymmetric state is not yet clear and , as ward stated , more study is needed to investigate whether the state is actually a local minimum or just a saddle - point .",
    "for these cases we prepared the initial states using wards proposal , that in the stereographic coordinates @xmath77 , a good ansatz for a @xmath78 hopfion is given by @xmath79 , where @xmath80 and @xmath81 is some specific function of @xmath82 ( see equation ( 4 ) in @xcite , ward uses @xmath83 ) .",
    "actually this can be generalized by adding some signs in the expression : @xmath84 here the sign of @xmath85 determines whether this is a hopfion or anti - hopfion , while the signs of the @xmath86 s can be changed by @xmath87 rotations around one of the coordinate axes .",
    "thus for a single hopfion the signs @xmath88 are irrelevant but they do play a role when we construct an initial state with two hopfions . ] one can not extract @xmath85 in order to say whether it describes a hopfion or an anti - hopfion . ]",
    "it was noted by ward @xcite that a good two hopfion ansatz is obtained just by adding the corresponding @xmath89 functions .",
    "thus for the case with two hopfions located at  @xmath90 and sharing the same axis ( ward s channel a ) we can take @xmath91 as the starting configuration . here",
    "@xmath92 .",
    "ward uses a dipole pair to describe the configuration , in our notation @xmath93 and @xmath94 , so that @xmath95 , etc",
    ". furthermore the angle between @xmath96 and @xmath97 is 0 if @xmath98 and @xmath87 if @xmath99 .",
    "the signs in can be changed by various @xmath87 rotations and this way the 16 possible sign combinations @xmath100 can be reduced to a canonical 6 .",
    "they are 1 ) @xmath101 ( @xmath102 s to same direction , angle @xmath103 ) , 2 ) @xmath104 ( @xmath102 s to same direction , angle @xmath87 ) , 3 ) @xmath105 ( @xmath102 s away from each other , angle @xmath103 ) , 4 ) @xmath106 ( @xmath102 s away from each other , angle @xmath87 ) , 5 ) @xmath107 ( @xmath102 s towards each other , angle @xmath103 ) , 6 ) @xmath108 ( @xmath102 s towards each other , angle @xmath87 ) .    the time evolution for these cases is as follows . for cases 1 and 2",
    "the system is in the attractive channel ( figure [ f7 ] , http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erzeu3v0wak[movie w1 ] ) .",
    "the hopfions approach each other , bounce a few times , during which they develop some asymmetry and eventually turn over , join and deform into a @xmath109 single ring hopfion .",
    "the four remaining cases 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 are repulsive : as the hopfions recede they slowly turn around their axis and it is plausible that they eventually turn enough to attract each other and return to form a single ring state .",
    "that is , we know that due to the fact @xmath110 the asymptotically separated configuration is a higher energy state than the single - ring configuration but it is unclear whether the initial configurations for these four repulsive systems have large enough repulsive ( escape ) energy to form the higher energy state . as the hopfions quickly reach the border of any finite computational space ,",
    "this is a hard question to answer using numerical methods alone .",
    "produces an attractive interaction between the two @xmath111 hopfions .",
    "the pair oscillates multiple times before a slight asymmetry brings the system to the more stable @xmath112 single - ring configuration . for details",
    "see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erzeu3v0wak[movie w1 ] , and the discussion in the end of section [ stacked hopfions ] .",
    "[ f7],width=453 ]      in order to better understand the effect of boundaries , we considered the @xmath104 case further and calculated its evolution in physical grids of different size , while keeping the grid constant and boundary conditions unchanged .",
    "our results are given in http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgc4_tca1x0[movie w2 ] , which combines the result from cubes of physical size @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 having @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 grid points , they are located at top left , top right , bottom left and bottom right , respectively .    in all cases",
    "the simulation starts with a slight repulsion during which the colors of the isosurfaces rotate towards the same phase .",
    "then the hopfions approach each other and bounce several times and eventually form a @xmath56 un - knot hopfion .",
    "the difference in the dynamics can be explained by the existence of two competing effects : the fixing of the boundary value to @xmath119 tends to stabilize the configuration , while the radiation reflecting from the boundaries tends to un - stabilize it .",
    "the radiation effects are illustrated in figure [ f : err ] , where we have plotted the values of the usually very revealing quantity @xmath120 on a slice of the box .",
    "the box in upper cases is relatively small and the closeness of the fixed boundary stabilizes the situation well and many bounces are required to un - stabilize it , even though there is lots of radiation bouncing around . the fastest un - stabilization occurs with box size @xmath117 ( lower left ) , in that case radiation effects overwhelm the boundary stabilization . in the largest box ( lower right )",
    "the radiation takes a longer time to reach the interaction region and therefore more bounces are again possible before deformations .",
    "clearly the major difference between these simulation is the time at which the radiation wave of the initial relaxation travels to the boundary and is reflected back to center of the grid . in smaller grids",
    "the boundary is so close that the first reflection happens before the hopfions even collide the first time .",
    "after a few more reflections an interference pattern is formed in the background but it is reasonably symmetric . in the larger grids",
    "the first reflected wave passes over the hopfion pair during the first couple of oscillations and this asymmetric perturbation causes the state to unwind faster .",
    "nevertheless the final result is always the same     slices of the canonical derivative field @xmath121 between a fixed interval @xmath122 $ ] at the same moment ( @xmath123 , @xmath124 ) in different physical size grids .",
    "we can see that the boundary effects are strongly present at the area around the hopfion s core in the first case , just reaching it in the second and third case and still outside the observed area in the fourth case .",
    "[ f : err],width=453 ]      another case considered by ward is that of hopfion rings side by side on the @xmath125-axis .",
    "the ansatz is now @xmath126 here",
    "in this case also the 16 possible sign combinations can be divided into 6 essentially different ones , to which others are related by rotations : 1 ) @xmath101 , polarization vectors @xmath102 parallel , 2 ) @xmath106 , antiparallel , 3 ) @xmath104 , parallel , 4 ) @xmath128 , parallel , 5 ) @xmath105 , antiparallel , 6 ) @xmath107 .",
    "cases 3 and 4 ( and cases 5 and 6 ) are related by an overall sign change , which can not be generated by a rotation .",
    "considering hopfions asymptotically as dipole pairs and studying the forces between them led ward to introduce the second attractive channel which corresponds to our case 3 above .",
    "ward s energy minimization gave an axially - symmetric ring for @xmath109 .",
    "this is believed to be the true global static minimum .",
    "@xcite    our numerical simulations show that the attractive and repulsive channels yield the same qualitative behavior as in the stacked case .",
    "however , now the attractive channel comprises of initial configurations 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 while the repulsive channel contains 1 and 2 .",

    "now let us fix @xmath86 configuration to repulsive @xmath106 with @xmath132 , then the attractive @xmath105 is obtained from with @xmath133 .",
    "it has already been observed that even in the repulsive case the hopfions turn around and could return if the computational box would be big enough . in order to study a case with only slight repulsion we chose the configuration @xmath106 for @xmath134 and found it to be attractive ( figure [ f12 ] and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icjajn21pzc[movie w4 ] ) while @xmath135 was still repulsive ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ud_gaiuijhg[movie w5 ] ) .",
