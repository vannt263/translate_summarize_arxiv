    "one of the fundamental questions in quantum statistical inference problem is to establish the ultimate precision bound for a given quantum statistical model allowed by the laws of statistics and quantum theory . mainly due to the non - commutativity of operators and nontrivial optimization over all possible measurements ,",
    "this question still remains open in full generality .",
    "this is very much in contrast to the classical case where the precision bounds are obtained in terms of information quantities for various statistical inference problems .",
    "the problem of point estimation of quantum parametric models is of fundamental importance among various quantum statistical inference problems .",
    "this problem was initiated by helstrom in the 1960s and he devised a method to translate the well - known strategies developed in classical statistics into the quantum case @xcite . a quantum version of fisher information was successfully introduced and the corresponding precision bound , a quantum version of cramr - rao ( cr ) bound , was derived .",
    "it turned out , however , that the obtained bound is not generally achievable except for trivial cases .",
    "a clear distinction regarding the quantum parameter estimation problem arises when exploring possible estimation strategies since there is no measurement degrees of freedom in the classical estimation problem .",
    "consider @xmath0 identical copies of a given quantum state and we are allowed to perform any kinds of quantum measurements according to quantum theory .",
    "a natural question is then to ask how much can one improve estimation errors by measurements jointly performed on the @xmath0 copies when compared to the case by those individually performed on each quantum state . the former class of measurements is called _ collective _ or _ joint _ and the latter is referred to as _",
    "separable _ in literature .",
    "it is clear that the class of collective measurements includes separable ones and one expects that collective measurements should be more powerful than separable ones in general .",
    "since one can not do better than the best collective measurement , the ultimate precision bound is the one that is asymptotically achieved by a sequence of the best collective measurements as the number of copies tends to infinity .",
    "this fundamental question has been addressed by several authors before @xcite .",
    "it was holevo who developed parameter estimation theory of quantum states by departing from a direct analogy to classical statistics .",
    "he proposed a bound , known as the holevo bound , in the 1970s aiming to derive the fundamental precision limit for quantum parameter estimation problem , see ch .",
    "6 of his book @xcite . at that time",
    ", it was not entirely clear whether or not this bound is a really tight one , i.e. , the asymptotic achievability by some sequence of measurements . over the last decade",
    ", there have been several important progress on asymptotic analysis of quantum parameter estimation theory revealing that the holevo bound is indeed the best asymptotically achievable bound under certain conditions @xcite .",
    "these results confirm that the holevo bound plays a pivotal role in the asymptotic theory of quantum parameter estimation problem . despite the fact that we now have the fundamental precision bound",
    ", the holevo bound has a major drawback : it is not an explicit form in terms of a given model , but rather it is written as an optimization of a certain nontrivial function . therefore , unlike the classical case , where the fisher information can be directly calculated from a given statistical model , the structure of this bound is not transparent in terms of the model under consideration .",
    "having said the above introductory remarks , we wish to gain a deeper insight into the structure of the holevo bound reflecting statistical properties of a given model . to make progress along this line of thoughts ,",
    "we take the simplest quantum parametric model , a general qubit model , and analyze its holevo bound in detail . since explicit formulas for the holevo bound for mixed - state models with one and three parameters and pure - state models are known in literature , the case of two - parameter qubit model is the only one left to be solved .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is to derive an explicit expression for the holevo bound for any two - parameter qubit model of mixed - states without referring to a specific parametrization of the model .",
    "remarkably , the obtained formula depends solely on a given weight matrix and three previously known bounds : the symmetric logarithmic derivative ( sld ) cr bound , the right logarithmic derivative ( rld ) cr bound , and the bound for d - invariant models .",
    "this result immediately provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the two important cases .",
    "one is when the holevo bound coincides with the rld cr bound and the other is when it does with the sld cr bound .",
    "we also show that a general model other than these two special cases exhibits an unexpected property , that is , the structure of the holevo bound changes smoothly when the weight matrix varies .",
    "we note that similar transition has been obtained by others @xcite for a specific parametrization of two - parameter qubit model . here",
    "we emphasize that our result is most general and is expressed in terms only of the weight matrix and two quantum fisher information .",
    "the main result of this paper is summarized in the following theorem ( the detail of these quantities will be given later ) : consider a two - parameter qubit model of mixed states , which changes smoothly about variation of the parameter .",
    "denote the sld and rld fisher information matrix by @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively , and define the sld and rld cr bounds by @xmath3&={\\mathrm{tr}\\left\\{w g_\\theta^{-1}\\right\\}},\\\\ c_\\theta^r[w]&={\\mathrm{tr}\\left\\{w \\re\\tilde{g}_\\theta^{-1}\\right\\ } } + { \\mathrm{trabs}\\left\\{w\\im\\tilde{g}_\\theta^{-1}\\right\\}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively . here , @xmath4 is a given @xmath5 positive definite matrix and is called a weight matrix ( @xmath6 is defined after eq .  . ) .",
    "introduce another quantity by c_^z[w]:=\\{w z _ } + \\{wz _ } , where @xmath7 is a @xmath8 hermite matrix defined by z_:=_i , j\\{1,2},z_^ij:= ( _ l_^j l_^i ) .",
    "here @xmath9 are a linear combination of the sld operators ; @xmath10 with @xmath11 denoting the @xmath12 component of the inverse of sld fisher information matrix and @xmath13 sld operators . with these definitions ,",
    "we obtain the following result :    [ thm1 ] the holevo bound for any two - parameter qubit model under the regularity conditions is [ eq1 ] c_^h[w]=    c_^r[w ]  c_^r[w ] + c_^r[w]+s _    , where the function @xmath14 $ ] , which is nonnegative , is defined by [ hsbound ] s_:= .",

    "( see the discussion after eq .  .",
    ")    the above main result [ thm1 ] sheds several new insights on the quantum parameter estimation problems .",
    "first note that the form of the holevo bound changes according to the choice of weight matrices .",
    "this kind of transition phenomenon has never occurred in the classical case .",
    "second surprise is to observe the appearance of the rld cr bound in the generic two - parameter estimation problem .",
    "as we will provide in the next section , the rld cr bound has been shown to be important for a special class of statistical models , known as a d - invariant model . here",
    ", we explicitly show that it also plays a major role for non d - invariant models .",
    "last , in many of previous studies parameter estimation problems , the precision bound is either expressed in terms of the sld or rld fisher information , but the second case of the above expression depends _ both _ on the sld and rld fisher information . to see this explicitly ,",
    "we can rewrite it as @xmath17+s_\\theta[w]= { \\mathrm{tr}\\left\\{wg_\\theta^{-1}\\right\\ } } \\\\ + \\frac14\\ \\frac{\\left({\\mathrm{trabs}\\left\\{w\\im\\tilde{g}_\\theta^{-1}\\right\\}}\\right)^2}{{\\mathrm{tr}\\left\\{w(g_\\theta^{-1}-\\re\\tilde{g}_\\theta^{-1})\\right\\}}}. \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] all these findings will be discussed in details together with examples .",

    ", we call a model _ asymptotically classical _ when this condition is satisfied",
    ". a similar terminology , `` quasi classical model , '' was used by matsumoto in the discussion of parameter estimation of pure states @xcite . here , we emphasize that classicality arises only in the asymptotic limit and hence , this terminology is more appropriate .",

    "we note that the notion of asymptotic classicality can be extended to any models on any finite - dimensional system and the same statement obtained for the qubit case holds : the holevo bound coincides with the sld cr bound if and only if the model is asymptotically classical .",
    "the detail of this result shall be given in the subsequent paper .",
    "second , the rld cr bound is shown to be achieved for a certain choice of the weight matrix even though the model is not d - invariant .",
    "this result emphasizes the importance of the rld fisher information for general qubit parameter estimation problems .",
    "since the imaginary parts of the inverse of the rld fisher information matrix and the @xmath7 matrix are always identical for two - parameter qubit mixed - state models , we can not immediately conclude that this is the general statement or not .",
    "it might well be that the only real part of the inverse of rld fisher information matrix plays an important role in higher dimensional systems .",
    "this deserves further studies and shall be analyzed as an extension of the present work .",
    "third , our result also provides the ( unique ) minimizer to the optimization problem appearing in the definition of the holevo bound .",
    "this set of observables , which are locally unbiased in the sense of eq .",
    ", can be used to construct an optimal sequence of povms that attains the holevo bound asymptotically .",
    "this line of approach has been proposed by hayashi , who reported a theorem without proof to realize the construction of povms on the tensor product states @xcite .",
    "his approach is different from other approaches given in refs .",
    "@xcite and it may need more refined arguments to complete his theorem .",
    "last , smooth transitions in the structure of the holevo bound is shown to occur in general .",
    "since this happens in the simplest quantum system , we expect similar phenomena occur in higher dimensional systems as well . however , we do not know whether or not the number of different forms is always two as demonstrated here .",

    "<S> the main contribution of this paper is to derive an explicit expression for the fundamental precision bound , the holevo bound , for estimating any two - parameter family of qubit mixed - states in terms of quantum versions of fisher information . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained formula depends solely on the symmetric logarithmic derivative ( sld ) , the right logarithmic derivative ( rld ) fisher information , and a given weight matrix . </S>",
    "<S> this result immediately provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the following two important classes of quantum statistical models ; the holevo bound coincides with the sld cramr - rao bound and it does with the rld cramr - rao bound . </S>",
    "<S> one of the important results of this paper is that a general model other than these two special cases exhibits an unexpected property : the structure of the holevo bound changes smoothly when the weight matrix varies . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , it always coincides with the rld cramr - rao bound for a certain choice of the weight matrix . </S>",
