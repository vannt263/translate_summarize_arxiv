    "practical solvability of performance analysis and control design problems for stochastic systems often depends on tractability of relevant quantities , such as moments of the system variables . for example , the kalman filtering and linear quadratic gaussian control theories @xcite substantially employ the preservation of gaussian nature of probability distributions of the state variables governed by linear sdes . under the linear dynamics , the first and second order moments of the variables ( and more complicated functionals of gaussian distributions )",
    "are amenable to a complete analysis .",
    "it is the convenience of linear gaussian models that makes them so popular in filtering / control with quadratic and related ( for example , risk - sensitive ) performance criteria .",
    "these advantages motivate the approximation of a nonlinear stochastic system by an effective linear model which underlies the stochastic linearization techniques .",
    "the latter date back to @xcite and have recently been extended to quantum stochastic systems @xcite .",
    "a different approach to computing the statistical characteristics of a nonlinear stochastic system ( oriented at approximating probability distributions rather than system dynamics ) consists , for example , in representing the probability distribution of its state variables as a mixture of gaussian distributions whose parameters evolve in time .",
    "in fact , mixed gaussian distributions arise as exact posterior probability distributions in the lainiotis multimodel filter @xcite , where the conditional gaussian distributions from partial kalman filters are weighted by recursively updated posterior probabilities of the corresponding linear models conditioned on the observations .",
    "this combination of a bank of kalman filters with a `` mixing '' block is a recursive implementation of the bayesian approach .",
    "the important property that the resulting mixture of gaussian pdfs is a legitimate pdf , which is nonnegative everywhere and satisfies the normalization condition , does not always come with pdf approximations , in general .",
    "for example , the truncated gram - charlier and edgeworth expansions @xcite , based on the hermite polynomials , are not equipped with this feature , although they provide control over moments or cumulants up to an arbitrary given order .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to outline an approach to the approximation of pdfs by using quadratic forms of weighted complex - valued orthonormal basis functions with positive semi - definite hermitian matrices of unit trace .",
    "these matrices are called stochastic density matrices ( sdm ) in order to emphasize an analogy ( and , at the same time , avoid confusion ) with the quantum mechanical density matrices @xcite .",
    "the sdm approximation leads to a legitimate pdf which is nonnegative everywhere and satisfies the normalization condition .",
    "furthermore , it retains the possibility to control the moments of the pdf for orthonormal bases with an algebraic structure , such as the hermite polynomial and fourier bases .",
    "the sdm approximation can be optimized by using a proximity criterion for pdfs based on the second - order relative renyi entropy @xcite , which leads to a quadratic minimization problem .",
    "this allows the sdm approach to be applied to pdfs of markov diffusion processes , governed by nonlinear sdes , by reducing the approximate numerical integration of the fokker - planck - kolmogorov equation ( fpke ) @xcite to the solution of an ode for the sdm , which resembles the galerkin approximations for parabolic pdes @xcite . as an illustration",
    ", we consider a smoluchowski sde @xcite on a multidimensional torus , which provides an example of a nonlinear stochastic system with rotational degrees of freedom .",
    "the sdm approach admits a real version in the case of real - valued basis functions , with an appropriate reformulation of the results .",
    "it is relevant to mention a connection of this approach with the methods using the sum of squares ( sos ) of polynomials for lyapunov stability analysis and global optimization @xcite .",
    "however , the sdm approach , proposed in the present paper , serves a different purpose here and is not restricted to polynomials .",

    "the state space in the form of a multidimensional torus corresponds to systems with rotational degrees of freedom .",
    "the sde ( [ ssde ] ) ( which is understood in the ito sense ) is a noisy version of the gradient descent for the function @xmath251 and is employed , for example , in the simulated annealing algorithm of stochastic optimization @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath251 can be interpreted as the potential energy of a dissipative dynamical system in contact with a heat bath at temperature @xmath252 which specifies the noise level @xmath253 in ( [ ssde ] ) as @xmath254 , with @xmath255 the boltzmann constant .",
    "this interpretation is motivated by the fact @xcite that the invariant probability measure for the smoluchowski sde ( [ ssde ] ) is absolutely continuous with the gibbs - boltzmann pdf @xmath256 here , @xmath257 is the statistical mechanical partition function @xcite of the auxiliary parameter @xmath258 , associated with the potential @xmath251 .",
    "the invariant pdf @xmath259 in ( [ inv ] ) is a unique equilibrium point of the fpke ( [ fpke ] ) for the pdf @xmath260 of the random vector @xmath261 , which takes the form @xmath262 here , @xmath263 and @xmath264 are the divergence and laplace operators over the spatial variables .",
    "the corresponding generator @xmath210 acts on a smooth test function @xmath265 as @xmath266",

    "in the context of molecular dynamics simulation , such @xmath251 can represent fractal - like energy landscapes ( as functions of the dihedral angles in protein macromolecules ) which are considered to play an important role in relaxation phenomena associated with protein folding @xcite .",
    "this motivates investigation of the pdf dynamics for such fpkes .",
    "we will now reformulate the fpke ( [ sfpke ] ) in the spatial frequency domain using the fact that all functions on the torus @xmath3 are @xmath267-periodic with respect to the angular variables and ( under the assumption of square integrability underlying the hilbert space @xmath268 ) can be represented by fourier series .",

    "@xmath223 is equivalent to @xmath274 since the potential @xmath251 is assumed to be twice continuously differentiable , @xmath275 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath251 is infinitely differentiable , it can be shown that the fpke ( [ sfpke ] ) has a smooth fundamental solution @xcite . similarly to the energy estimates for parabolic pdes @xcite , the norm @xmath276 at any time @xmath277 is amenable to an upper bound in terms of @xmath278 .",

    "another upper bound for the renyi entropy @xmath176 is provided by the inequalities @xmath286 where both denominators are finite and strictly positive due to ( [ inv ] ) and the continuity of @xmath251 over the torus .",
    "the second of these inequalities follows from the dissipation relation @xmath287 whereby @xmath288 is a nonincreasing function of time @xmath289 . here",
    ", @xmath290 is the pdf of the markov process @xmath222 with respect to the invariant measure ( so that the first equality in ( [ brff ] ) is similar to ( [ brdot ] ) ) , and use is made of a change of measure together with the relations @xmath291 and @xmath292 , with the latter following from ( [ cg ] ) .",
    "now , ( [ vf ] ) allows the matrix elements of the generator @xmath210 over the fourier basis ( [ fourier ] ) to be computed as @xmath293 for all @xmath294 .",
    "hence , in addition to ( [ f0 ] ) , the fourier coefficients of the pdf @xmath172 satisfy a denumerable set of odes @xmath295 which represent the fpke ( [ sfpke ] ) in the spatial frequency domain .",
    "here , the convolution sum comes from the term @xmath296 and is responsible for the coupling of these odes ( the trivial case of a constant potential @xmath251 is not considered ) .",
    "the truncation of the set of odes ( [ freqode ] ) ( for example , in accordance with galerkin s method for parabolic pdes @xcite ) leads to an approximate system of equations whose solution is not necessarily nonnegative and does not correspond to a legitimate pdf on the torus .",

    "the sdm approach is also applicable ( in the spirit of projective filtering @xcite ) to the approximation of posterior pdfs governed by the kushner - stratonovich equations @xcite . in this application ,",
