    "the concentration of pms stars versus ysos is striking .",
    "of the candidate pms stars , 38% lie within grid - section ( 4,3 ) .",
    "the majority of yso candidates lie farther from cluster center , notably along ridges in the east / south - east and west , and four ysos ( y149 , y163 , y493 , and y700 ) lie outside the optical fov .",
    "grid section ( 5,3 ) contains 6 of the 36 well - fit ysos but less than 7% of the pms stars .",
    "grid - section ( 4,2 ) includes 6 well - fit ysos ( seven if y270o and y270i are counted separately ) , 3 yso candidates that are not well - fit , and another probable yso with insufficient photometry for our fitting requirements .",
    "although these ( 4,2 ) ysos correspond to many pms candidates , less than 12% of all pms candidates fall within this grid - section . also notable are the evident ages of the pms sources in the central versus outer grid - sections . in ( 4,3 ) , the pms population aligns well with the 1  myr isochrone ( red ) with some older and some younger . other grid - sections ( e.g. , ( 3,2 ) , ( 3,3 ) , ( 3,4 ) , ( 4,2 ) , ( 4,4 ) , ( 4,5 ) , ( 5,3 ) , and ( 6,3 ) ) suggest younger pms populations that lie redward of the 1  myr isochrone ( in red ) . while some of this is likely the result of increased reddening in these dustier areas",
    ", extinction is insufficient to account for the measurable trend .",
    "( figure  [ isocmd ] shows the appropriate reddening vector . )",
    "we consider two components of the ms , old and young populations .",
    "many of the edge regions contain only old ms and rgbs .",
    "virtually all of the optical sources in grid - sections ( 1,3 ) and ( 1,5 ) , which contain @xcite sub - clusters ngc  602-b and ngc  602-b2 ( alternately b  164 and cluster  a in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , are old stars . the young ms ( m@xmath174 ) population is concentrated at cluster center , particularly in grid - section ( 4,3 ) with the pms concentration .",
    "the distances from cluster center to pms and yso candidates of different stages reveal a gradient .",
    "we define the cluster center as the center of the distribution of pms candidates ( ra , dec : 22@xmath175.3855 , -73@xmath175.5584 or @xmath176 , @xmath177 ) , which is approximately the center of the main o / b association .",
    "we measure the projected distance to pms and yso candidates . as a correction for the three - dimensional distance",
    ", we make the simple assumption that the actual physical distances are @xmath178 times these projected distances .",
    "we have a list of 565 pms candidates , 484 of which lie within 30  pc of cluster center .",
    "we consider these 484 to be strong candidates , as their positions are consistent with a common triggering process , and their clustering near the o / b association makes their nature more certain .",
    "the primary locus of the pms population is clear from image examination ( see figures  [ dist ] and [ timescale ] ) , and the distribution is approximately gaussian .",
    "we define the pms distance as the radius from cluster center that will include 50% of these strong pms candidates and use error bars defined by the radii including 40% and 60% of the strong candidates .",
    "the result is r@xmath179  pc .    for the average distances to ysos",
    ", we remove sources outside the acs fov because their nature is less certain , and their formation may be triggered in a different manner .",
    "y700 , for example , lies on its own semi - circular ridge of 8.0  @xmath0 m emission .",
    "the average distances from cluster center to yso stages are : stage  ii @xmath180  pc , stage  i / ii @xmath181  pc , and stage  i @xmath182  pc , where the error bars are the standard deviations of the mean .",
    "we consider a simple picture of ngc  602 in which the region consists of a central o / b association surrounded by concentric shells of star formation .",
    "we make the assumption that star formation began at cluster center ( the center of the pms distribution ) approximately 3  myr ago and is propagating outward .",
    "this picture is shown schematically in figure  [ timescale ] ; for simplicity , we only include shells for pms , stage  ii , and stage  i sources .",
    "as mentioned in section  [ intro ] , @xcite have shown that the nebular expansion velocities are negligible , so collapse / star formation ( beginning yso stage 0 ) is most likely being triggered along ionization fronts .",
    "we assume a local sound speed of @xmath183  km / s ( as appropriate for an ionized region at t@xmath184k ) for the speed of star formation propagation . dividing the distances by this sound speed",
    ", we derive timescales for the populations .",
    "the pms population formed within @xmath185  myr of the o / b association formation .",
    "the average time between the formation of the o / b association and the ysos increase with less evolved yso stages as follows : stage  ii @xmath186  myr , stage  i / ii @xmath187  myr ; and stage  i @xmath188  myr .",
    "the stage  i / ii shell forms between stage  i and stage  ii , representing a mix of stage i and ii sources .",
    "these timescales associated with the yso stages represent samples of the continuous propagation of star formation radially outwards in the ngc 602 region ; there is , however , overlap between all of the shells .",
    "sources of uncertainty include imprecise distances due to three - dimensional structure and low - number statistics .",
    "the relative times between the triggering of these stages can also be used to estimate stage lifetimes .",
    "pms stars and what are now stage  ii sources are triggered @xmath189  yr apart , indicating that the stage ii evolution lasts on the order of @xmath190  yr .",
    "likewise , stage  i sources have a lifetime @xmath191  yr , from the time difference between stage  i and ii shells .",
    "we are unable to account for the probable effects of mass on the range of yso evolutionary timescales .",
    "the smallest value for the stage  i shell radius ( i.e. , the best estimate minus the uncertainty ) is @xmath183  pc ( 1  myr ) , indicating that triggering occurred as much as 2  myr , which may be taken as a firm upper limit to stage  i lifetimes .",
    "massive sources are expected to evolve more quickly than low mass sources ; most of our candidates are protoclusters / multiple sources , leading us to expect a multiplicity of masses and thus stages within individual yso candidate .",
    "the uncertainty in these numbers is large , particularly because we are unable to analyze the expected correlation between mass and stage lifetime with such low number statistics and the current resolution .",
    "however , the results are interesting ; the temporal differences between the triggering of pms and stage  ii , stage  ii and stage  i / ii , and stage  i / ii and stage  i are all approximately equal ( a few @xmath8  yr ) . our stage  i lifetime is consistent with the lifetimes measured for ysos in the galactic star - forming region , m17 , by @xcite .",
    "we construct a time - ordered scenario for the progression of star formation in ngc  602 . approximately 7",
    "myr ago , two expanding hi shells began to interact , creating an over - density in the region that is now n90 .",
    "after @xmath192  myr , turbulence subsided sufficiently for star formation to begin in earnest , @xmath162  myr ago @xcite .",
    "the current population of bright main sequence ( o and b ) stars and low - mass pms stars formed near the center of the over - dense region approximately 2 - 3  myr ago .",
    "the radiation from the massive stars began to erode the surrounding nebula , creating a photodissociation region and triggering further star formation around the edges .",
    "the formation of the current stage  ii ysos was triggered @xmath193  myr ago , the formation of the current stage  i ysos @xmath194  myr later ( or @xmath195  myr ) .",
    "we present a multi - wavelength analysis of photometry and imaging of the ngc  602 active star - forming region in the smc , covering _ hst _ 0.55 through _ spitzer _",
    "24  @xmath0 m . from these data , we define stellar and proto - stellar populations and their spatial distribution .",
    "we estimate the present - day star formation rate and derive time scales for the formation of stage  i and stage  ii ysos . we provide full mutli - wavelength photometric catalogs online and present approximate physical and evolutionary parameters for all of our yso candidates .",
    "our primary modes of source analysis are cmd examination and sed fitting .",
    "optical @xmath196 cmds reveal @xmath10565 pms candidates , essentially low mass stage  iii ysos , through isochrone fitting . through multi - wavelength",
    "sed fitting , we identify 41 yso candidates , including 24 stage  i , 8 stage  i / ii , 5 stage  ii , 2 stage  ii / iii , and 2 unclassified candidates .",
    "high - resoultion _ hst _ imaging shows that @xmath197 of the yso candidates include multiple sources or are protoclusters , and most of these optical sources are pms candidates .",
    "efforts to construct yso protocluster models and incorporate them into the sed fitter are underway but are beyond the scope of this paper . for the @xmath1020 yso candidates , we are able to estimate masses for one or more optical counter - parts via comparison with cmd evolutionary tracks , and we find consistency between these lower limit optical masses and the yso sed fitter masses .",
    "we also construct a mass function from yso sed fitter masses and derive a present - day star formation rate of 0.2 - 1  @xmath99  yr@xmath6  kpc@xmath7 .    finally , we present a quantitative analysis of the spatial distribution of the yso population with respect to the central cluster and pms population .",
    "we find that star formation has progressed from cluster center to the edge of the star forming dust cloud in ngc  602 .",
    "the pms stars are heavily concentrated near cluster center and that the yso population distribution can be represented as concentric shells with stage  ii sources preferentially closer to cluster center and stage  i sources farther away .",
    "previous observations @xcite have shown that there is no significant expansion of the dust shell in which most of our yso candidates are located and that the photo - ionization front is the prime mover of the star formation activity .",
    "we therefore correlate average distances of the stage  i and ii ysos from cluster center with the times at which their formation is triggered ; we divide the distances by the sound speed . relating the timescales",
    ", we find the lifetimes of each yso stage to be a few @xmath8  yr , comparable to timescale estimates in the literature which apply independent techniques to galactic star - formation regions .",

    "<S> , we compare the young main sequence ( ms ) and pre - main sequence ( pms ) populations prominent in the optical with the current young stellar object ( yso ) populations revealed by the infrared ( ir ) . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the ms and pms population with isochrones in color - magnitude diagrams to derive ages and masses . </S>",
    "<S> the optical data reveal @xmath2 pms candidates , low mass stage  iii ysos . </S>",
    "<S> we characterize @xmath3 ysos by fitting their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) to a grid of models @xcite to derive luminosities , masses and evolutionary phase ( stage  i - iii ) . </S>",
    "<S> the higher resolution _ hst _ images reveal that @xmath4 of the yso candidates are either multiples or protoclusters . for ysos and pms sources found in common , we find a consistency in the masses derived . </S>",
    "<S> we use the yso mass function to derive a present - day star - formation rate of @xmath5 yr@xmath6 kpc@xmath7 , similar to the rate derived from the optical star formation history suggesting a constant star formation rate for this region . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate a progression of star formation from the optical star cluster center to the edge of the star forming dust cloud . </S>",
