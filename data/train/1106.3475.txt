    "the magnetotransport properties of a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in presence of a weakly modulated one - dimensional ( 1d ) periodic electric potential has been studied in great details experimentally and theoretically for a long time @xcite . in the absence of the modulation and the spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) , the magnetoconductivity oscillations due to the charged impurities",
    "are commonly known as the shubnikov - de hass ( sdh ) oscillations . in the presence of the modulation and at low magnetic fields , it has been observed that the magnetoresistivity tensor oscillates with the inverse of the magnetic field .",
    "these oscillations are completely different in periodicity and temperature dependence from the sdh oscillations observed at higher magnetic field .",
    "these oscillations are commonly known as the weiss oscillations .",
    "this is due to the effect of the commensurability between the two length scales in the system : the cyclotron diameter at the fermi energy and the modulation period @xmath4 .",
    "the similarity and differences between the weiss and the sdh oscillations are as follows : i ) both the oscillations are periodic in @xmath5 ii ) the period of the weiss oscillation varies with the electron density ( @xmath6 ) as @xmath7 , whereas that of the sdh ones as @xmath6 ; iii ) the amplitude of the weiss oscillations less dependent on temperature than that of the sdh oscillations ; iv ) the weiss oscillations are visible at weak magnetic field ( @xmath8 t ) and the sdh oscillations modulated by the weiss oscillations are visible at higher fields .    in conventional 2deg systems , magnetotransport properties in the presence of 1d electric and magnetic modulations",

    "the magnetothermodynamical properties of electrically or magnetically modulated 2deg has also been studied where the weiss - type oscillation is also shown @xcite . later , the magnetoresistance oscillation in a magnetically modulated 2deg system was observed experimentally @xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "a 1d spatially varying magnetic modulation was achieved by placing micro - patterned ferromagnet or superconductor on the surface of a 2deg system .",
    "an internally generated crystal field induces the soi which is known as the rashba soi .",
    "the rashba interaction strength can also be controlled by a strong external electric field acting normal to the 2deg plane .",
    "using the rashba interaction it was possible to explain many experimentally observed features like the combined resonances @xcite and the beating patterns in the sdh oscillations @xcite .",
