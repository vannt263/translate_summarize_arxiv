    "the recent measurement of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies obtained by the wmap satellite @xcite has considerably tightened the error bars on the cosmological parameters that describe the standard @xmath0cdm model of structure formation .",

    "@xcite , there are measurements on six angular scales , in each of three redshift bins . since there are two correlation functions available for shear , the number of data points sums up to 36 .",

    "although not seen in the simulated hst simulations of @xcite , more comprehensive tests on a larger set of simulated ground - based images @xcite reveal the potential for the shear to be underestimated in faint or small galaxies .",

    "@xcite , we also compute the combination @xmath67 , which is best probed by the cosmos lensing data .",
    "we ran first a mcmc analysis of the cosmos wl data alone .",
    "we recall that this analysis differs from that in massey et al .",
    "@xcite in four ways : the methodology ( mcmc with flat priors on the cosmological parameters instead of maximum likelihood ) , the introduction of one extra independent parameter @xmath4 , the fact that we compute the exact linear matter power spectra numerically , and the treatment of systematic errors . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the analysis performed with statistical errors only led to the bounds @xmath68 ( 68% confidence level ( c.l . ) ) , which extend to @xmath69 when systematic errors are added linearly . here",
    "we first performed a mcmc analysis excluding the systematic errors , and obtained @xmath70 .",
    "the increased error bar with respect to @xcite is presumably due to the inclusion of an arbitrary spectral index @xmath4 in the analysis , which opens new parameter degeneracies .",
    "the mean value of massey et al .",
    "( 2007 ) ( 0.866 ) is perfectly consistent with this value .",
    "we then incorporated systematic errors as described in the last section and found @xmath71 note that because of non - linear corrections to the matter power spectrum , the @xmath13 parameter can not be viewed as a simple calibration parameter for the theoretical correlation functions . a change in @xmath13 changes both the amplitude and the shape of the shear correlation functions in a non - trivial way .",
    "as a consequence , the impact of systematic errors on the determination of the ( linear theory ) parameter @xmath67 is found to be smaller than the data calibration uncertainty itself .",
    "the 68% confidence limits on each parameter are presented in the first column of table  i. we also show the joint 68% and 95% confidence contours in @xmath3@xmath6 and @xmath3@xmath4 space in fig .",

    "[ fig_each ] the @xmath3-@xmath6 and @xmath3-@xmath4 confidence regions for each dataset separately .",
    "the cosmos data is compatible with wmap , since the contours have some overlap even at the 68% level . in the @xmath3-@xmath6 space , the cosmos and wmap",
    "contours appear as almost orthogonal , and the overlap clearly suggests that the wl data prefers the highest @xmath3 values allowed by wmap .",
    "the cosmos data is also compatible with the different data sets , with again an overlap at the 68% level .",
    "finally , the wmap and contours overlap only at the 2 @xmath10 level , as expected from previous works  @xcite .    the two panels in fig .",
    "[ fig_each ] provide a good illustration of the advantages of combining various datasets .",
    "for each type of experiment , @xmath3 and @xmath6 are clearly correlated , but the direction of the degeneracy is different for cmb , wl and data .",
    "there are various reasons for the difference between the direction of correlation associated with the wl and data : first , the raw data are in units of s / km ( since the power spectrum is measured in velocity space ) , and the rescaling to units of @xmath65/mpc depends on @xmath6 ; second , the data probe different redshifts , and the ratio between the power spectrum today ( when @xmath3 is defined ) and at a given redshift depends on @xmath6 ; third , the slope of the matter power spectrum depends on @xmath6 .",
    "this explains the `` banana shapes '' in the upper left panels , with different orientations .",
    "we do nt find any significant correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath74 ( upper right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig_each ] ) . for the wl and data ,",
    "this is due to the fact that these experiments directly probe power on the scale at which @xmath3 is defined ( if this was not the case , the amplitude of the wl and experimental points would constrain a combination of @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) .",
    "we then ran some markov chains for various combinations of different data sets and we show the results in table  [ tab1bis ] , [ tab1ter ] and fig .",
    "[ fig_comb ] . combining the data sets significantly",
    "tightens the constraints .",
    "most noteworthy is that there remains a ( moderate ) strain between the inferred value of @xmath3 between that inferred from wmap alone and that inferred from the lensing and forest data .",
    "the constraint on @xmath3 from cosmos+ly@xmath27vhs ( @xmath75 ) and from cosmos+ly@xmath27sdss - d ( @xmath2 ) are compatible with the wmap best - fit value ( @xmath76 ) respectively at the 1.1-@xmath10 and 2.4-@xmath10 level .",
    "note that the sdss - d contours are based on extrapolations using a taylor expansion of the flux power spectrum around a best fit model and are likely to underestimate the error for parameters far from the best fit model .",
    "however , when this data set is used in combination with wl and/or wmap data , the 68% and 95% c.l .",
    "contours remain in a small region where the taylor expansion is accurate .",
    "the main results of this work are the 68% confidence limits for the combined analysis of cmb , weak lensing and forest data : wmap+cosmos+ly@xmath27vhs , @xmath77 ; wmap+cosmos+ly@xmath27sdss - d , @xmath7 .    finally , we performed a further mcmc analysis with an extended @xmath0cdm model with on extra parameter , a running of the spectral index @xmath5 .",
    "the results are summarized in table  iv . in this case , the tilt @xmath4 is defined at the pivot scale @xmath78 ( when wl and data are included , the pivot value @xmath79 adopted in the wmap3 paper @xcite is too small with respect to the median scale of the full data set ) .",
    "the choice of a given pivot scale is indifferent for the definition of @xmath5 .",
    "wmap alone is compatible with a rather large negative running , @xmath80 ( 68%c.l . ) which results in a reduction of power on small scale .",
    "small scale experiments like forest and weak lensing observations are obviously crucial for the determination of a possible running of the spectral index , since they increase the lever arm for primordial spectrum reconstruction .",
    "the high @xmath3 value preferred by wl and data excludes the most negative values of @xmath5 found by wmap , and reduce its error by a factor of two .",
    "we find @xmath81 for wmap+cosmos+ly@xmath27vhs and @xmath82 for wmap+cosmos+ly@xmath27sdss - d ( 68%c.l . ) .",
    "we have presented a joint analysis of the constraints on the matter power spectrum and the density of dark matter from three different cosmological probes : the cmb temperature and polarization anisotropy measurements of wmap year three , the state - of - the - art weak lensing cosmos survey and two independent forest data sets .",
    "the different observables are prone to very different systematic errors and parameter degeneracies , and more importantly probe different scales and redshifts .",
    "assessing their consistency is an important test of the @xmath0cdm paradigm and is crucial for further improving constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "the measurements of the matter power spectrum on small and intermediate scale based on forest and weak lensing data agree very well and suggest a higher amplitude ( @xmath2 with the analysis of sdss forest data based on the flux derivatives method of @xcite ) than the wmap data alone ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "the direction of degeneracy between the amplitude of the power spectrum on galaxy scales the parameters governing its shape ( in other words , the direction of degeneracy in @xmath3@xmath4 and @xmath3@xmath6 space ) is different for the forest and weak lensing data .",
    "these two observables thus complement each other very well and combining them results in a significant improvement . combining all three observables",
    "we get either @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath9 ( with the analysis of sdss forest data based on the flux derivatives method of @xcite ) or @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 ( with the high resolution data of vhs ) .",
    "we further explored the constraints for a running of the spectral index and found the data to be consistent with no running at less than the 2@xmath10 level . adding the smaller scale data sets",
