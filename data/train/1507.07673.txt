    "as summarized by norberg @xcite , an insurance company which invests its wealth in a financial market is exposed to two kinds of risk . the first kind",
    ", called insurance risk , is the traditional liability risk caused by insurance claims , and the second kind , called financial risk , is the asset risk related to risky investments .",
    "the interplay of the two risks unavoidably leads to a complicated stochastic structure for the wealth process of the insurance company .",
    "paulsen @xcite proposed a general continuous - time risk model in which the cash flow of premiums less claims is described as a semimartingale and the log price of the investment portfolio as another semimartingale .",
    "since then the study of ruin in the presence of risky investments has experienced a vital development in modern risk theory ; some recent works include paulsen @xcite , klppelberg and kostadinova @xcite , heyde and wang @xcite , hult and lindskog @xcite , bankovsky _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and hao and tang @xcite . during this research ,",
    "much attention has been paid to an important special case of paulsen s set - up , the so - called bivariate lvy - driven risk model , in which the two semimartingales are independent lvy processes fulfilling certain conditions so that insurance claims dominate financial uncertainties .",
    "a well - known folklore says that risky investments may impair the insurer s solvency just as severely as do large claims ; see norberg @xcite , kalashnikov and norberg @xcite , frolova _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and pergamenshchikov and zeitouny @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we describe the insurance business in a discrete - time risk model in which the two risks are quantified as concrete random variables .",
    "this discrete - time risk model builds an efficient platform for investigating the interplay of the two risks .",
    "the ruin probabilities of this model have been investigated by nyrhinen @xcite , tang and tsitsiashvili @xcite , collamore @xcite , and chen @xcite , among many others .",
    "concretely , for each @xmath3 , denote by @xmath4 the insurer s net loss ( the total amount of claims less premiums ) within period @xmath5 and by @xmath6 the stochastic discount factor ( the reciprocal of the stochastic accumulation factor ) over the same time period .",
    "then the random variables @xmath7 , @xmath8 ,   and @xmath9 , @xmath10 ,  represent the corresponding insurance risks and financial risks , respectively . in this framework , we consider the stochastic present values of aggregate net losses specified as @xmath11 and consider their maxima @xmath12    if @xmath13 , @xmath14 ,   form a sequence of independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "random pairs fulfilling @xmath15 and @xmath16 , then , by lemma  1.7 of vervaat @xcite , @xmath17 converges almost surely ( a.s . ) as @xmath18 . in this case , denote by @xmath19 the a.s . limit .",
    "clearly , @xmath20 is non - decreasing in @xmath5 and @xmath21 thus , if @xmath22 and @xmath23 , then @xmath20 also converges a.s . to a limit , denoted by @xmath24 , as @xmath18 .",
    "we conduct risk analysis of the insurance business through studying the tail probabilities of @xmath17 and @xmath20 for @xmath25 .",
    "the study of tail probabilities is of fundamental interest in insurance , finance , and , in particular , quantitative risk management .",
    "moreover , the tail probability of @xmath20 with @xmath26 is immediately interpreted as the finite - time or infinite - time ruin probability .    in most places of the paper ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to the standard framework in which @xmath7 , @xmath8 ,   form a sequence of i.i.d .",
    "random variables with generic random variable @xmath0 and common distribution @xmath27 on @xmath28 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ,  form another sequence of i.i.d .",
    "random variables with generic random variable @xmath2 and common distribution @xmath29 on @xmath30 , and the two sequences are mutually independent .    under the assumption that the insurance risk @xmath0 has a regularly - varying tail dominating that of the financial risk @xmath2 , tang and tsitsiashvili @xcite obtained some precise asymptotic formulas for the finite - time and infinite - time ruin probabilities .",
    "the dominating relationship between @xmath0 and @xmath2 holds true if we consider the classical black  scholes market in which the log price of the investment portfolio is modelled as a brownian motion with drift and , hence , @xmath2 has a lognormal tail , lighter than every regularly - varying tail .",
    "however , empirical data often reveal that the lognormal model significantly underestimates the financial risk .",
    "it shows particularly poor performance in reflecting financial catastrophes such as the recent great recession since 2008 .",
    "this intensifies the need to investigate the opposite case where the financial risk @xmath2 has a regularly - varying tail dominating that of the insurance risk @xmath0 . in this case , the stochastic quantities in ( [ s ] ) and ( [ m ] ) become much harder to tackle with the difficulty in studying the tail probability of the product of many independent regularly - varying random variables .",
    "tang and tsitsiashvili @xcite gave two examples for this opposite case illustrating that , as anticipated , the finite - time ruin probability is mainly determined by the financial risk .",
    "chen and xie @xcite also studied the finite - time ruin probability of this model and they obtained some related results applicable to the case with the same heavy - tailed insurance and financial risks .    in this paper , under certain technical conditions ,",
    "we give a unified treatment in the sense that no dominating relationship between the two risks is required .",
    "that is to say , the obtained formulas hold uniformly for the cases in which the insurance risk @xmath0 is more heavy - tailed than , less heavy - tailed than , and equally heavy - tailed as the financial risk @xmath2 . in our main result , under the assumption that every convex combination of @xmath31 and @xmath29 is of strongly regular variation ( see definition  [ srv ] below ) , we derive some precise asymptotic formulas for the tail probabilities of @xmath17 and @xmath20 for @xmath26 .",
    "all the obtained formulas appear to be linear combinations of @xmath32 and  @xmath33 .",
    "hence , if one of @xmath32 and @xmath34 dominates the other , then this term remains in the formulas but the other term is negligible ; otherwise , both terms should simultaneously present .",
    "these formulas are in line with the folklore quoted before , confirming that whichever one of the insurance and financial risks with a heavier tail plays a dominating role in leading to the insurer s insolvency .    in the rest of this paper , section  [ sec2 ] displays our results and some related discussions after introducing the assumptions , section  [ sec3 ] prepares some necessary lemmas , and section  [ sec4 ] proves the results .",
    "throughout this paper , all limit relationships hold for @xmath35 unless otherwise stated . for two positive functions @xmath36 and @xmath37 , we write @xmath38 or @xmath39 if @xmath40 , write @xmath41 if both @xmath38 and @xmath42 , and write @xmath43 if both @xmath44 and @xmath45 . for a real number @xmath46",
    ", we write @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "we restrict our discussions within the scope of regular variation .",
    "a distribution @xmath49 on @xmath50 is said to be of regular variation if @xmath51 for all @xmath46 and the relation @xmath52 holds for some @xmath53 . in this case",
    ", we write @xmath54 .",
    "however , such a condition is too general to enable us to derive explicit asymptotic formulas for the tail probabilities of the quantities defined in ( [ s ] ) and ( [ m ] ) . to overcome this difficulty ,",
    "our idea is to employ some existing results and techniques related to the well - developed concept of convolution equivalence .",
    "a distribution @xmath55 on @xmath56 is said to be convolution equivalent if @xmath57 for all @xmath46 and the relations @xmath58 and @xmath59 hold for some @xmath60 , where @xmath61 stands for the @xmath62-fold convolution of @xmath55 .",
    "more generally , a distribution @xmath55 on @xmath50 is still said to be convolution equivalent if @xmath63 is . in this case",
    ", we write @xmath64 .",
    "relation ( [ l(alpha ) ] ) itself defines a larger class denoted by @xmath65 .",
    "it is known that the constant @xmath66 in relation ( [ s(alpha ) ] ) is equal to @xmath67 see cline @xcite and pakes @xcite .",
    "we shall use the notation @xmath68 as above for the moment generating function of a distribution @xmath55 throughout the paper .",
    "the class @xmath69 coincides with the well - known subexponential class .",
    "examples and criteria for membership of the class @xmath70 for @xmath71 can be found in embrechts @xcite and cline @xcite .",
    "note that the gamma distribution belongs to the class @xmath65 for some @xmath71 but does not belong to the class @xmath70 .",

    "our standing assumption is as follows :    [ assumption a]every convex combination of @xmath31 and @xmath29 , namely @xmath87 for @xmath88 , belongs to the class @xmath89",

    "this fact can be restated as that , if @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 , then @xmath112 and @xmath113 are equivalent . by this fact , the verifications of ( a ) and ( b ) are straightforward . for ( c ) , by theorem  2.0.8 of bingham _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , the relation @xmath102 holds uniformly on every compact @xmath114-set of @xmath30 .",
    "then the verification can be done by using theorems 3.4 and 3.5 of cline @xcite .      in this subsection , we assume that @xmath115 and @xmath116 are two independent sequences of i.i.d .",

    "as we pointed out before , theorem  [ no1 ] does not require a dominating relationship between @xmath32 and @xmath34 . even in assertions",
    "( b ) and ( c ) where @xmath130 is assumed , there is not necessarily a dominating relationship between @xmath32 and @xmath34 , though the conditions on @xmath32 and @xmath34 become not exactly symmetric any more .",
    "additionally , theorems 5.2(3 ) and 6.1 of tang and tsitsiashvili @xcite are two special cases of our theorem  [ no1](a ) with @xmath148 and @xmath149 , respectively .    since the famous work of kesten @xcite , the tail probabilities of @xmath150 and @xmath24 have been extensively investigated , mainly in the framework of random difference equations and most under so - called cramr s condition that @xmath151 holds for some @xmath71 .",
    "traditional random difference equations appearing in the literature are often different from ones such as ( [ m1 ] ) and ( [ t recursive equation ] ) below associated to our model .",
    "nevertheless , under our standard assumptions on @xmath152 and @xmath153 , these subtle differences are not essential and the existing results can easily be transformed to our framework .",
    "we omit such details here . corresponding to our model , kesten s work @xcite shows an asymptotic formula of the form @xmath154 assuming , among others , that @xmath2 fulfills cramr s condition and @xmath0 fulfills a certain integrability condition involving @xmath2 .",
    "kesten s constant @xmath155 , though positive , is generally unknown .",

    "@xcite for a probabilistic representation for this constant .",

    "where @xmath97 for some @xmath71 , @xmath156 for some @xmath157 , and @xmath158 , indicating that the insurance risk dominates the financial risk , grey s work @xcite shows a precise asymptotic formula similar to ours .",
    "goldie and grbel @xcite interpreted the study in terms of perpetuities in insurance and finance and they derived some rough asymptotic formulas .",
    "corresponding to our model , their results show that @xmath19 exhibits a light tail if @xmath0 is light tailed and @xmath159 , while @xmath19 must exhibit a heavy tail once @xmath160 , regardless of the tail behavior of @xmath0 , all being consistent with the consensus on this topic that risky investments are dangerous .",
    "we also refer the reader to hult and samorodnitsky @xcite , collamore @xcite , blanchet and sigman @xcite , and hitczenko and wesoowski @xcite for recent interesting developments on the topic .",
    "in contrast to these existing results , we do not require cramr s condition or a dominating relationship between @xmath32 and @xmath34 in theorem  [ no1](b ) , ( c ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath133 and @xmath134 appearing in our formulas , though still generally unknown , assume transparent structures as given in ( [ bc ] ) , which enable one to easily conduct numerical estimates .",
    "the condition @xmath130 in theorem  [ no1](b ) , ( c ) is made mainly to ensure the finiteness of @xmath133 and  @xmath134 .",
    "however , it excludes some apparently simpler cases such as @xmath161 and classical random walks ( corresponding to @xmath162 ) .",
    "the tail behavior of the maximum of a random walk with negative drift , especially with heavy - tailed increments , has been systematically investigated by many people ; see , for example , feller @xcite , veraverbeke @xcite , korshunov @xcite , borovkov @xcite , denisov _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and foss _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , among many others .",

    ", intriguing questions include how to capture the precise asymptotics other than kesten and goldie s for @xmath170 and @xmath171 and how to connect the asymptotics for @xmath172 and @xmath173 as @xmath174 to kesten and goldie s formula @xmath154 .",
    "the approach developed in the present paper seems not efficient to give a satisfactory answer to either of these questions",
    ".    admittedly , the standard complete independence assumptions on the two sequences @xmath175 and @xmath153 , though often appearing in the literature , are not of practical relevance .",
    "however , theorem  [ no1 ] offers new insights into the tail probabilities of the sums in ( [ s ] ) and their maxima in ( [ m ] ) , revealing the interplay between the insurance and financial risks .",
    "furthermore , extensions that incorporate various dependence structures into the model are expected and usually without much difficulty .",
    "we show in the next subsection a simple example for such extensions .",
    "as done by chen @xcite , in this subsection we assume that @xmath176 is a sequence of i.i.d .",
