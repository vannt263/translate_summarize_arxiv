    "partial substitution of alkaline - earth metals for rare - earth metals in rcoo@xmath3 ( r - rare - earth element ) and their subsequent ordering of results in double layered perovskites .",
    "one such ba substituted layered perovskites are rbaco@xmath0o@xmath1 , ( @xmath4 1 ) . the ionic size difference between ba and r and the resultant valance of co due to oxygen non - stoichiometry",
    "make cobaltites more complex to study .",
    "they are of very special interest for their unique properties like metal insulator transition ( mit ) , spin state transition , charge ordering and giant magnetoresistance ( mr)@xcite .",
    "these properties have their origin in the strong interplay between crystallographic , magnetic and transport properties . a property that distinguishes the cobaltites from other transition metal perovskites",
    "is the crystal field splitting of the _",
    "3d _ energy level of the co ion .",
    "it is of the same order of magnitude as the hund s rule intra - atomic exchange energy .",
    "spin state transition can therefore be easily provoked by varying temperature , pressure , magnetic field or chemical composition ( oxygen content or rare earth ion ) of the material .",
    "these spin state transitions are believed to be responsible for their unique properties .",
    "the transport properties of the layered cobaltites are found to be very sensitive due to the coexistence of ferromagnetic ( fm ) and antiferromagnetic ( afm ) state . a giant negative magnetoresistance ( mr ) ( of about 10@xmath5 ) coinciding with fm - afm transition has been observed in gdbaco@xmath0o@xmath6 @xcite . whereas labaco@xmath0o@xmath6 exhibits a strongly irreversible mr near fm - afm transition @xcite .",
    "oxygen non - stoichiometry is one of the important aspect in these layered cobaltites .",
    "tailoring of oxygen content realizes in different valance states of cobalt ion ( 2 + , 3 + , 4 + ) and different local environments , both of which play a crucial role in their magnetic properties @xcite .",
    "the structure of co based double perovskites also depends on the oxygen content ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "in general , the lower and higher oxygen content compounds crystallize in tetragonal structure with 112 type unit cell while the intermediate members crystallize in orthorhombic 122 type unit cell @xcite .",
    "the magnetic properties are found to be correlated to oxygen content and crystal structure .",
    "while the compounds with lower @xmath2 have afm ground state , fm dominates in compounds richer in oxygen . when @xmath2 = 1 , the fm order is associated with metallic behavior due to double exchange interaction @xcite . with the decrease in oxygen content",
    ", a transition from metallic to insulating state occurs in the paramagnetic state and further as the number of trivalent co ions increase fm order changes to afm ordering .",
    "neutron diffraction studies on prbaco@xmath0o@xmath8 reveal a paramagnetic to fm and an incomplete fm to afm transition@xcite .",
    "furthermore , in these oxygen rich compounds , the co@xmath9 ions in octahedral coordination are found to be in hs state as compared to ls state in prbaco@xmath10o@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "it is therefore not clear if the hs to ls spin state transition of octahedral co@xmath9 ions is responsible for the transition from fm to afm ground state . or it is the delocalization of pd@xmath11 holes that are responsible for the afm to fm transition in these double perovskites @xcite .",
    "our recent studies have shown that local structure around co ions plays an important role deciding the magnetic properties of these hole doped cobaltites @xcite .",
    "hence it would be worthwhile to explore the local structure around co ions in these layered cobaltites and correlate them with their magnetic properties .",
    "in particular , it would be interesting to examine the changes in local structure of co ions as the ground changes from fm to afm .    extended x - ray absorption fine structure ( exafs ) spectroscopy is known to be a valuable tool to probe the local structure .",
    "exafs has been effectively used to understand the local structural distortions and the spin state of co ion in the parent rcoo@xmath12 compounds @xcite . in comparison to rcoo@xmath13 , the oxygen cage around co ion is more distorted in rbaco@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "it is suspected that the deformation of polyhedra modify the hybridization between outer orbits of cation ( r , ba , co ) and @xmath14 orbitals of oxygen ion which affect electric and magnetic properties of double perovskites @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the difference between the ionic radii of r and ba along with deformed polyhedra will affect the crystal field splitting of the @xmath15 band @xcite .",
    "herein we report exafs spectroscopy investigations on two oxygen rich prbaco@xmath0o@xmath1 , ( @xmath2 = 0.80 and 0.67 ) compounds crystallizing in the same 112 type structure but having different magnetic ground states .",
    "while fm dominates in compound with @xmath2 = 0.8 , the other one ( @xmath2 = 0.67 ) has predominantly afm ground state .",
    "the polycrystalline samples of prbaco@xmath0o@xmath1 were prepared by sol - gel method .",
    "stoichiometric amounts of pr@xmath16o@xmath17 , baco@xmath12 and co(no@xmath0)@xmath12.6h@xmath0o were dissolved in nitric acid .",
    "citric acid was added to the above solution as a complexing agent . the solution was then heated at 353k to form a gel which was subsequently dried at 433k to remove the solvent .",
    "this precursor was ground , pelletized and heated at 1073k for 4 hours followed by annealing at 1323 k for 24 hours and slow cooling at the rate of 1@xmath18/min to room temperature to get the required sample .",
    "this as synthesized sample had an oxygen stoichiometry of @xmath19 as determined by iodometric titration @xcite . to obtain a sample with lower oxygen content , the above as prepared sample was further annealed in argon atmosphere at 673k for 36 hours and quenched in ice water .",
    "the oxygen content as determined by iodometric titration was found to be @xmath20 .",
    "x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) data were recorded using rigaku d - max iic x - ray diffractometer in the range of @xmath21 with cu k@xmath22 radiation to ascertain phase formation .",
    "the diffraction patterns were rietveld refined using fullprof suite and structural parameters were obtained .",
    "resistivity measurements were performed in the temperature range 325k-10k using four probe method .",
    "magnetization measurements were carried out as a function of temperature using a quantum design squid magnetometer in an applied field of 1000oe and in the temperature range of 10k to 300k .",
    "the sample was initially cooled from room temperature to the lowest temperature ( 10k ) in zero applied field .",
    "magnetization was recorded while warming under an applied field ( zero - field cooled ( zfc ) ) and subsequent cooling ( field - cooled cooling ( fcc ) ) and warming ( field - cooled warming ( fcw ) ) cycles .",
    "the magnetotransport studies were carried out in longitudinal geometry using oxford spectromag 10 t magnet .",
    "resistance as a function of temperature r(t ) was measured in the range 10k - 300k in 0 t and 8 t during warming and cooling cycles .",
    "isothermal magneto - resistance mr was measured at selected temperatures by ramping the field in the range @xmath238 t .",
    "the local structure around co ion was investigated by measuring x - ray absorption fine structure ( xafs ) at the co k edge at various temperatures between 325k to 20k .",
    "these experiments were carried out in transmission using bl 7c at photon factory japan .",
    "the absorbers were prepared by sprinkling finely powdered sample on a scotch tape and stacking such layers to obtain optimum thickness such that @xmath24 .",
    "rietveld refinement of room temperature xrd patterns of prbaco@xmath10o@xmath1 for @xmath2 = 0.67 and 0.80 confirm the formation of single phase samples with 112 type tetragonal unit cell belonging to p4/mmm space group .",
    "as can be seen from figure [ xrd ] both compounds show presence of very minor impurity phases ( @xmath25 1% ) with peaks around 2@xmath26 and 31@xmath18 which can be ascribed to unreacted pr - oxides ( pr@xmath10o@xmath3 , pr@xmath27o@xmath17 ) .",

    "no splitting of ( 200 ) reflection as expected for an orthorhombic structure was seen .",

    "neutron diffraction studies have indicated afm ordering at t@xmath46 = 220k in prbaco@xmath10o@xmath6 @xcite .",

    "the presence of competing magnetic interactions , presence of short range correlations at temperatures much above ordering temperature , irreversibility in isothermal magnetoresistance make it evidently clear that the local structure around co and its spin state play an important role in governing magnetic and transport properties of these layered double perovskites .",
    "exafs measurements at co k edge and at various temperatures can give an insight of changes in local structure and spin state of co ions .",
    "the temperature dependant exafs spectra recorded at various temperatures were treated using ifeffit software @xcite .",

    "= 0.8 , it can be seen that the co - o planar bond length ( figure [ exafs](b ) ) decreases steadily with temperature followed by an increase around 150k which coincides with the t@xmath59 of the compound .",
    "a similar behavior is also noted for the planar co - o - co bond angle ( figure [ exafs](c ) ) .",
    "on the other hand , the co - o apical bond distance exhibits a step like behavior with an increase around 240k .",
    "this elongation of coo polyhedra along @xmath63-axis and the concomitant shrinkage in co - o planar bond length and the co - o - co bond angle corresponds to the tilting of coo polyhedra towards each other .",
    "further , at lower temperatures ( @xmath25 150k ) the polyhedra rotate about c axis resulting in increase of co - o planar bond length and the planar co - o - co bond angle .",
    "a similar variation of bond distances can be seen in the case of @xmath2 = 0.67 .",
    "the elongation along c - axis and tilting of co - o polyhedra can be seen to happen around 300k ( figure [ exafs](e ) , ( f ) ) . at lower temperatures ,",

    "the two compounds under study prbaco@xmath10o@xmath1 with @xmath65= 0.67 and 0.80 crystallize in tetragonal unit cell with p4/mmm structure .",

    "charge balance demands 30@xmath5 co ions to be in tetravalent state while the rest 70@xmath5 to be in trivalent state .",
    "the value of @xmath43 obtained from curie - weiss analysis of susceptibility and its agreement with that reported for prbaco@xmath10o@xmath8 @xcite indicates that co@xmath66 ion are in ls state while co@xmath67 ions are in hs / is state .",
    "therefore the observed fm ordering can be ascribed to double exchange ( de ) interaction between ls co@xmath47 ( @xmath68 ) and hs / is co@xmath9 ( @xmath69 or @xmath70 ) ions .",
    "these de interactions are facilitated by tilting and the rotation of co@xmath9o and co@xmath47o polyhedra towards each other about the @xmath63 axis .",
    "this increases the co(3d ) - o(2p ) hybridization leading to a ferromagnetic order .",

    "mott s vrh law is best obeyed in the temperature region between 200k and 50k .",
    "deviations from linearity can be noticed below and above this temperature range .",
    "mr also exhibits be irreversibility at t@xmath71 50k and positive values at low fields at t = 200k .",
    "it may be noted that t = 200k corresponds approximately to the temperature at which co - o polyhedra tilt towards each other while the weak afm interactions noticed below 50k could be implied to be due to superexchange ( se ) interactions between co@xmath9 ions as per goodenough - kanamori rule .    for prbaco@xmath10o@xmath45 ,",
    "the properties are found to be very different . with the decrease in oxygen",
    "content though the percentage of co in square pyramidal coordination and those in trivalent state increases the value of @xmath43 obtained from curie weiss fit to susceptibility is nearly the same as that in prbaco@xmath10o@xmath39 .",
    "this implies that co@xmath9 continue to be in hs / is state and the co@xmath47 ions in ls state .",
    "therefore antiferromagnetic superexchange interaction can be expected between neighboring coo polyhedra containing trivalent cobalt ions while the co@xmath9-o - co@xmath47 pairs will interact via double exchange mechanism .",
    "exafs studies indicate that the antiferromagnetic se interactions are a result of the outward rotation of co@xmath72o polyhedra about the @xmath63-axis .",
    "the presence of competing ferromagnetic interactions arising due to de interactions can give rise to canting of co spins resulting in an increase in magnetization at about 150k .",
    "the antiferromagnetic order localizes the charge carriers leading to a much higher resistivity as compared to @xmath2 = 0.8 compound and a much lower mr even near the afm transition .",
    "in summary , it can be concluded that the local structure and the changes therein play an important role for magnetic and transport properties of layered perovskites . in the case of @xmath2 = 0.80",
    "the inward rotation and tilting of the neighboring co@xmath9o and co@xmath47o polyhedra about the c - axis facilitates de mechanism between ls co@xmath47 and hs / is co@xmath9 ions leading to ferromagnetic order .",
    "while in case of @xmath2 = 0.67 the tilting and outward rotation of the neighboring co@xmath9o polyhedra away from each other supports co@xmath9 - o- co@xmath9 superexchange mediated antiferromagnetic ordering .",
