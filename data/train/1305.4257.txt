    "the subjects of surfaces decorated with particles in periodically or quasiperiodically packed configurations and the arrangement of spheres on spherical , cylindrical or general surfaces have attracted a long - standing interest @xcite .",
    "the focus has been mainly on the type of packing , defect stabilisation and interactions , and the topological constraints associated with non - vanishing gaussian curvature .",
    "a most prominent problem concerns the stabilisation of crystalline order on a sphere , first predicted @xcite and then experimentally observed in colloidal spheres on water droplets @xcite .",
    "the problem has many important consequences in a number of fields ; for example , possible packings of protein capsomeres in spherical viruses @xcite , behaviour of particles inserted in lipid membranes and their curvature - induced interactions @xcite , metallic clusters , structure of fullerenes , to name just a few .",
    "the spherical or effectively spherical surface is the most studied , while several studies have also appeared on cylindrical surfaces .",
    "recently , nelson studied the interaction of dislocations on a cylindrical surface @xcite ; despite the vanishing gaussian curvature of the cylinder , a rich phenomenology was found .    of particular interest",
    "is the case when particles are not spherical but elongated , since here there are issues of packing not only from the translational but also from the orientational degrees of freedom .",
    "hence one has here two fields , the position and the nematic - director fields , that compete and interact with the geometry to possibly stabilise complex defected patterns . in a nematic phase particle positions are disordered but the nematic director is still contrained by the topology .",
    "the possibility of stabilising defects by confining a thin nematic film on a spherical surface is intriguing .",
    "for example , using computer simulation , dzubiella et al .",
    "@xcite studied the nematic ordering of hard rods confined to be on the surface of a sphere . in this case",
    "the confinement on a spherical surface induces a global topological charge in the director field due to the stabilisation of half - integer topological point defects .",
    "another interesting , much less analysed , aspect , concerns the formation of phases with partial positional order ( liquid - crystalline ) from a disordered phase and the conditions imposed by topology , curvature and periodicity on the ordering and phase interplay as thermodynamic conditions ( such as surface density of particles or temperature ) are varied . in liquid - crystalline phases with partial or total translational order ( smectic , columnar or crystalline ) the two fields are coupled , and a complex interaction with the topology may result .",
    "this problem may be relevant in connection with the ordering of large protein molecules inserted into lipid membranes , where curvature may both induce or modify order and be induced or modified by order .    in the present article we focus on a system of parallel circular , rectangular particles confined to a cylindrical surface ( therefore the nematic phase is the most disordered phase of the system ) .",
    "this is motivated as a useful model to discuss ordering of squared or rectangular proteins or otherwise on rod - shaped bacterial cell membranes , but the model can be analysed in a broader context . despite its simple topology ,",
    "the non - vanishing curvature and periodicity perpendicular to the cylinder axis may induce or supress ordering in some of the two orthogonal directions , giving rise to possible smectic or columnar orderings of the particles on the cylindrical surface .",
    "this problem has some similarities with the adsorption of particles _ inside _ slit - like or cylindrical pores ( an example of which is the recent study on the confinement of hard spheres ( hs ) into cylindrical pores @xcite , or of hard rods into planar pores @xcite , both employing the density - functional ( df ) formalism ) .",
    "recently the close - packed structures of hs confined in cylindrical pores of small radii were classified using analytical methods and computer simulations @xcite .",
    "all of these studies reflect the importance of the commensuration between the pore width ( in our case the circle diameter ) and the characteristic dimensions of particles in the structure and stability of the confined non - uniform phases .",
    "recent studies show that the extreme confinement of particles along one direction makes the system behave like an ideal gas in this direction .",
    "thus the corresponding degrees of freedom can be integrated out and the resulting lower - dimensional system can be described by an effective interparticle potential @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present article is twofold .",
    "first , we derive a density - functional theory for a fluid of parallel circular rectangles on an external cylindrical surface ; this model is isomorphic to a fluid monolayer of parallel cylinders adsorbed on an external cylindrical surface , or to the same fluid confined between two concentric cylindrical surfaces such that only one shell of cylinders can be accommodated with no radial motion .",
    "we show that the functional may be obtained consistently from different routes due to the important dimensional - crossover property of the theory .",
    "this property was first used to derive a fundamental measure density functional ( fmf ) for hs @xcite and parallel hard cubes ( phc ) @xcite , and it was recently applied to obtain a density functional for hard parallel cylinders @xcite .",
    "second , the model is analysed statistical - mechanically by investigating the free - energy minima landscape .",
    "we discuss different rgimes for the ratio of radius of the external cylinder to radii of the underlying adsorbed cylinders .",
    "when the ratio is sufficiently low the model is an effectively 1d model and no phase transition exists .",
    "otherwise the smectic phase is found to be the most stable except for a relative small range of densities in which the crystalline phase appears as a reentrant phase .",
    "these results are in line with those of recent experiments on confined liquid crystals in silica - glass nanochannels , which show that the stability of the smectic phase is considerably enhanced by the confinement at the expense of the crystalline phase @xcite .",
    "we finally propose , following the dimensional cross - over property , a df for spherical lenses ( the intersection between a hs of radius @xmath2 which center of mass is located on an external sphere of radius @xmath1 , with @xmath5 ) moving on a spherical surface .    the article is arranged as follows . in section [ seci ]",
    "we derive the density - functional theory for hard curved rectangles ( cr ) on an external cylindrical surface .",
    "this is done in two steps : in the first ( section [ secia ] ) , the 2d functional for hard discs ( hd ) is projected on the surface of an external circle , thus obtaining a 1d functional for curved arcs ( ca ) that move along the circumference of the external circle . in the second ( section [ secib ] ) the functional is developed along the direction perpendicular to the circle to give a 2d functional for cr .",
    "dimensional consistency is discussed in section [ secic ] .",
    "the results are presented in section [ secii ] . in section [ lenses ]",
    "we propose , following the same dimensional cross - over recipe , a df for spherical lenses which center of mass are confined on a external sphere .",
    "finally some conclusions are presented in section [ seciii ] .",
    "details on the derivation of the density functionals and the density profile parameterizations are relegated to appendices [ a_a]-[a_e ] .",
    "in this section we derive the fmf for our model system , i.e. a fluid of cr .",
    "we do it in two steps .",
    "first , the 2d functional for hd of radius @xmath2 is projected on the external surface of a cylinder of radius @xmath1 , providing a 1d functional for a fluid of ca ( section [ secia ] ) .",
    "then , this 1d functional is developed along the orthogonal dimension to obtain a 2d functional for the cr fluid ( section [ secib ] ) .",
    "the two cases @xmath7 and @xmath5 are discussed separately in each case , since they give rise to fundamentally different expressions . in the last part of this section the resulting functionals are shown to be dimensionally consistent .",
    "we start from the fmf excess free energy for a fluid of hd derived in refs .",

    "is how the symmetry of the crystalline structure , and the presence of defects and vacancies , could change with the ratio @xmath9 .",
    "the present work followed two motivations .",
    "the first was to illustrate the dimensional cross - over criterion as a powerful projection tool to obtain a df for hard particles with centres of mass constrained to be on a particular ( in the present case cylindrical ) surface from a given df which fulfills this criterion .",
    "the second motivation was the study of the phase behaviour of cr ( the particles obtained by projecting the centres of mass of hc onto a cylindrical surface ) .",
    "we show that surface curvature has a profound impact on the stability of the liquid - crystal phases of curved rectangles as compared with the planar case .",
    "the projection method is quite general and can be used to obtain dfs for other particle geometries and other surfaces . as an example , we proposed in sec .",
    "[ lenses ] a df for spherical lenses , i.e. the particles obtained when the centres of mass of hs are placed on an external spherical surface .    during the derivation of df for cr we proved the dimensional cross - over properties of the fmf of hd of radii @xmath2 when their centers of mass are constrained to be on a circumference of radius @xmath1 . depending on the ratio @xmath9 the original 2d density functional reduces to the 1d percus functional ( when @xmath163 ) or to the 0d functional ( @xmath12 ) , which are both exact limits . from these dimensionally - reduced functionals , using the dimensional expansion procedure , we derive the density functional for cr moving on a cylindrical surface of radius @xmath1 . we show that this functional is equivalent to that of phr on a flat surface with the edge - lengths of the particles being @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we minimized the functional for cr to get the phase behavior for different values of @xmath9 . when @xmath163 we obtain that the most stable phase is s , as compared to the c or k phases , except for some relatively large values of @xmath9 and small density intervals in which we find a reentrant k phase .",
    "we find also metastable c@xmath166-c@xmath167 or k@xmath166-k@xmath168 transitions related to the commensuration between the particle width and the perimeter of the cylindrical surface .",
    "these transitions could become stable when the confined hc have different lengths ( it is well known that the length polydispersity destroy the s ordering ) . when @xmath12 the density functional of cr coincides with the 1d percus functional , so that the system does not exhibit any phase transition .",
    "we are presently performing mc simulations of cr with the aim to compare the phase behavior with that obtained from the present fmf .",
    "note that the latter , being a 2d functional , is not exact .",
    "the present phase behavior points to possible textures that adsorbed molecules ( for example proteins ) on cylindrical membranes could exhibit .",
    "if these molecules are highly anisotropic , highly oriented along the cylinder axis and interact repulsively with each other , their stable textures should include only nematic and smectic - like configurations for low and high densities , respectively .",
    "the wall of some rod - shaped bacteria grows in the direction of the cylinder axis , keeping the radius approximately constant .",
    "the new proteins come from the inside of the cell to the wall . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors explain cell growth by the insertion of these proteins into the wall and their subsequent active diffusion along the perimeter of the cylinder via a dislocation - mediated growth .",
    "the model assumes that the proteins form a square lattice on a surface of the cylinder ( this is apparently confirmed by experiments ) .",
    "protein diffusion along the wall - perimeter ( activated by the cell machinery ) departs from some of these dislocations which constitute the source of the new proteins coming from the cell .",
    "our results show that the smectic - like configuration of proteins favors their transversal diffusion .",
    "also the sources of new molecules could be located at any position inside the smectic layers with marginal energy cost associated to the spatial deformation of layers ( as they are fluid - like ) .",
    "however this mechanism makes the cylindrical membrane grow in the transversal direction .",
    "growth along the longitudinal direction is possible by creating new smectic layers and consequently smectic - like defects in the layers .",
    "this is an alternative mechanism that might explain the growth of cells whose membranes are constituted by molecules that form smectic - like textures .",
