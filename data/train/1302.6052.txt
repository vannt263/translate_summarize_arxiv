    "the nucleus is the largest and stiffest organelle in a eukaryotic cell  @xcite .",
    "it is actively coupled to the dynamic cytoskeleton  @xcite by means of a variety of scaffold proteins : contractile @xcite acto- myosin complexes , microtubule filaments constantly undergoing dynamic reorganization , and load bearing intermediate filaments  @xcite .",
    "the nucleus has been found to translate and rotate during cell migration  @xcite .",
    "it is reasonable to suppose that such motions are a result of active processes in the cytoplasm , involving the cytoskeleton and molecular motors  @xcite .",
    "the positioning of the nucleus in the cellular environment is critical to many physiological functions such as migration , mitosis , polarization , wound healing , fertilization and cell differentiation  @xcite .",
    "alterations to nuclear position have been implicated in a number of diseases  @xcite . taken together",
    "these studies suggest that the mechanical homeostatic balance of nuclear positioning and dynamics is intimately coupled with cellular geometry .",
    "while a number of molecular players have been implicated in this context  @xcite , the role of actomyosin contractililty on nuclear dynamics has not been explored .    in this paper , we show that cell geometry and active stresses are critical components in determining nuclear position and movements .",
    "fibroblast cells ( nih3t3 ) plated on micro- patterned fibronectin surfaces of varying shapes and aspect ratio were used to assess the effect of geometrical constraint on the translational and rotational movement of the nucleus .",
    "time - lapse imaging revealed a correlation between actin flow patterns and nuclear movement .",
    "we show that a hydrodynamic model of oriented filaments endowed with active contractile stresses  @xcite , with the nucleus entering only as a passive inclusion , gives rise to the observed organized actin flow and nuclear rotation . while preparing the present work for submission , we became aware of two works  @xcite with theoretical formulation and predicted behaviours similar to ours .",
    "the contexts in which these works are set is different from ours , i.e. , the dynamics of the cell nucleus is not the subject of these papers . in addition , the boundary conditions are different in detail .",
    "reference  @xcite was in a taylor - couette geometry , i.e. , there is no medium inside the inner circle , and reference  @xcite was in a circular geometry without a central inclusion .",
    "our observations suggest that nuclear rotation and circulating flows are an inherent property of the active cell interior under geometric confinement . that nuclear rotation is not a normally observed feature of cell dynamics suggests that the cell must possess other mechanisms to suppress it .",
    "we discuss these towards the end of the paper .",

    "the mixture was degassed in the desiccator for at least 30 minutes to remove any trapped air bubbles and was then cured at @xmath5c for 2 hours , after which the stamps were peeled off from the silicon wafer .",

    "the pdms stamp was then deposited onto the surface of a low well non - treated hydrophobic dishes ( ibidi ) ( for high - resolution imaging ) to allow transferring of the micro - features .",
    "subsequently , the stamped dish was inspected under fluorescent microscope to verify the smooth transfer of fibronectin micro - patterns .",

    "* image analysis and quantifications * : acquired images were processed and analysed using imagej software ( http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/index.html ) . to determine the translational coordinates and rotational angle of nucleus ,",
    "diagonally opposite nucleoli were manually tracked from the phase contrast image of the cell using the imagej plugin- mtrackj ( http://www.imagescience.org/meijering/software/mtrackj/ ) .",
    "the translational and rotational autocorrelation were calculated from the residual of the linear fit to corresponding curves- the detrended curves , thereby taking into account only the time scales relevant in our measurements .",
    "particle image velocimetry ( piv ) analysis was carried out using matlab piv toolbox - matpiv between consecutive image frames separated by 1min .",

    "all the graphs and curve fittings were carried out using originpro 8.1 ( originlab corporation , northampton , usa ) .",
    "to assess nuclear dynamics independent of cell migration , we used micro - patterned fibronectin- coated substrates to confine cells to regions of defined geometry and size .",
    "single cells were cultured on each patterned substrate and time lapse phase contrast imaging was carried out for about 8 hours ( or till the cell underwent mitosis ) .",
    "geometries with a variety of rotational symmetries  circle , square , equilateral triangle and rectangles with aspect ratios 1:3 and 1:5  but the same cell spreading area ( @xmath11m@xmath12 ) were fabricated and used to study effect of cell shape on the translational and rotational movement of the nucleus .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig_1]a - e shows color - coded intensity - profile images obtained by average - intensity projection of phase - contrast time lapse images for the above cases ( figure  [ fig : fig_1]a - c are for rectangles with aspect ratio 1:1 , 1:3 and 1:5 , figure  [ fig : fig_1]d and e are for triangle and circle ) . the dark color or low intensity at the vertices of the triangular and rectangular patterns shows the formation of stable contacts in that region , a feature absent on the circular pads . note",
    "that the cell adheres much more stably on the triangular pattern than on the circle or the square .",
    "the translational and rotational movements were measured from the time lapse images , and show convincingly the influence of cell geometry on nuclear dynamics .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig_1]f displays typical trajectories of the nucleus on triangular and rectangular geometries of same area . on rectangles , presumably because of narrower confinement , the nucleus undergoes mainly translation while on triangles ( as well as circles and squares ) the nucleus both rotates and translates , as shown in supplementary movie 1 - 5 .",
    "since motion out of plane is negligible , we resolve the dynamics into two - dimensional translation and rotation in the xy plane .",
    "translation is estimated through the instantaneous mean position @xmath13 of two nucleoli situated at roughly diametrically opposed points ( @xmath14,@xmath15 ) and ( @xmath16,@xmath17 ) .",
    "the top inset to figure  [ fig : fig_1]f shows a typical translation trajectory .",
    "rotation is characterised by the coordinates of one nucleolus relative to this mean .",
    "a typical rotational track for the nucleus is shown in the bottom inset to figure  [ fig : fig_1]f .",
    "although rotation of the nucleus is not a normal feature of cell cycle , both translational and rotational movement of the nucleus during cell migration has been reported  @xcite for many cell types including nih3t3 which was used in all our experiments . for completeness , we document such motion here as well .",
    "figure  [ fig : s1]a shows a representative dic image of a monolayer of nih3t3 cells cultured on glass bottom dishes .",
    "time lapse images ( figure  [ fig : s1]b ) of three cells from this field of view are presented with arrows showing the position of the nucleolus .",
    "rotation and translation tracks of the nucleus are plotted for these cells in figure  [ fig : s1]c and d respectively , showing large departures from its initial position and orientation . finally , in order to demonstrate that migration is not the underlying cause of the rotation we observe , we confine cells by plating them onto fibronectin patterns of various well - defined geometries , allowing us to study the effect of cell geometry alone on nuclear dynamics .",
    "the fraction of rotating nuclei decreases significantly in geometries with large aspect ratio whereas on more symmetric patterns namely equilateral triangles , squares and circles , the fraction is not significantly different ( figure  [ fig : fig_2]a ) .",
    "except on rectangles , about @xmath18 of cells showed at least @xmath19 nuclear rotations in 8 hours .",
    "nuclear circularity as a function of cell shape is altered with changes in aspect ratio ( decreases from 0.9 to 0.7 , supplementary figure  [ fig : s2]a ) but not with changes in rotational symmetry of constraints .",
    "the instantaneous linear velocity decreases marginally from circle to square to triangle as well as with increase in aspect ratio of rectangle ( 1:1 - 0.23 @xmath20/min and 1:5  0.20 @xmath20/min , see figure  [ fig : fig_2]b and supplementary figure  [ fig : s2]b ) .",
    "the mean rotational velocity decreases from circle ( @xmath21/min ) to square ( @xmath22/min ) to triangle ( @xmath23/min ) ( figure  [ fig : fig_2]c and supplementary figure  [ fig : s2]c , d and e ) suggesting that rotation is sensitive to geometric constraints .",
    "however , the fraction of nuclei showing significant and systematic rotation is similar for these three shapes . to explore the possible role of myosin induced contractility in these phenomena",
    ", we turn now to the active hydrodynamic theory  @xcite of the cell interior .",
    "we show that cytoplasmic flows produced by acto- myosin contractility are the minimal explanation for the observed rotation of the nucleus . to this end",
    ", we turn to the theoretical framework of active hydrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "contractile stresses carried by actomyosin , given an arrangement of filaments compatible with the cell shape imposed by the pads and the presence of the nucleus as an internal obstacle , lead to organized flows that rotate the nucleus .",
    "more detailed propulsive elements , e.g. , pushing by microtubules anchored onto the nuclear surface  @xcite , while possibly present in the cell , are not a necessary part of the mechanism .",
    "since the cell in the experiment is stretched , its height is smaller than its dimensions in the plane .",
    "we can therefore model the cell as a quasi - two - dimensional film with the hydrodynamics being cut off at a scale proportional to the height .",
    "we also assume an axisymmetric cell , and ignore actomyosin treadmilling and the on - off kinetics of the motors .",
    "this highly simplified view of the cell still exhibits some key features of the dynamics found in the experiment .",
    "we now present the equations of active hydrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "the inner circular region represents the nucleus , which is taken to contain no active motor - filament complexes and is therefore modeled as a passive liquid drop of very high viscosity ( @xmath24 )  in effect undeformable .",
    "the outer annular region is the cytoplasm , which contains active orientable filaments . the inner fluid - fluid interface , i.e.",
    ", the boundary between cytoplasm and nucleus , has tangential stress continuity and tangential velocity continuity , and the outer surface , the contact line of cell with pad , has no slip .",
    "we assume the filaments preferentially lie parallel to any surface with which they are in contact .",
    "in particular , they therefore lie tangent to both the inner and the outer boundaries .",
    "the cytoplasmic medium is taken to consist of filaments suspended in the cytosol of viscosity @xmath25 .",
    "we assume the filaments are in a state of well - formed local orientation whose manitude does not change so that it can be characterised completely by a unit vector or ",
    "director \" field , @xmath26 ,  @xcite at postion @xmath27 . associated with the filaments is an active stress @xmath28 , where the parameter @xmath29 is a measure of actomyosin activity , the concentration of filaments and myosin is assumed uniform .",
    "fluid flow in the cytoplasm is described by the hydrodynamic velocity field @xmath30 the equations of active hydrodynamics in steady state lead to a dynamic balance between shearing and relaxation of filaments  @xcite , @xmath31 and force balance , ignoring inertia , @xmath32 with total stress tensor @xmath33-p\\delta_{ij } - w n_i n_j + \\lambda_{kij}\\frac{\\delta",

    "we will work with a completely symmetric stress , @xmath40 , built from @xmath41 , which will give the same velocity field , due to angular momentum conservation  @xcite .",
    "the coefficient @xmath42 in represents in a @xmath43-averaged sense the effects of confinement on the damping of velocities .",
    "it has two contributions : a viscous part @xmath44 arising because flows within an adhered cell of thickness @xmath45 in the vertical @xmath43 direction and no - slip at the base must in general have @xmath43-gradients on a scale @xmath45 , and direct damping of flow through the kinetics of attachment and detachment of the cytoskeletal gel to the substrate . in our estimates below",
    "we retain only the viscous effect , so that @xmath42 simply has the effect of screening the hydrodynamics at in - plane length - scales larger than @xmath45 . including attachment - detachment",
    "enhances @xmath42 .",
    "we use circular polar coordinates @xmath46 in the plane .",
    "since we assume axisymmetry , the radial velocity vanishes because incompressibility implies @xmath47 , and @xmath48 at both the interfaces . for force balance in the region corresponding to the nucleus we have to solve the equation @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "the equation can be solved in terms of bessel functions , with the constraint that @xmath51 has to be @xmath52 at @xmath53 .",
    "continuity of tangential stress and velocity at the cytoplasm - nucleus interface gives the requisite number of boundary conditions .",
    "force balance in the azimuthal direction reads @xmath54 expressing the diretor @xmath55 the steady state equation for the orientation field reads @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the velocity gradient tensor .",
    "using , the @xmath59 component of can be recast as a first order differential equation for @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath60    thus , we have two first order equations , and , and one second order equation to solve , which we solve numerically .    a noticable and robust feature of the solution ( inset to fig .",
    "5a ) is the presence of a maximum in the magnitude of the velocity at some distance from the nucleus .",
    "this results from a combination of vanishing velocity at the outer boundary and the nuclear centre , and continuity of velocity and shear stress at the fluid - fluid interface .",
    "note that our description does not include chiral effects , so that equivalent solutions with either sense of rotation are obtained .    the competition between active stresses that promote flow and orientational relaxation , that inhibits it , is contained in the dimensionless combination @xmath61  @xcite .",
    "accurate estimates of parameters for our system are not easy to make . the cytoskeletal active stress , w , is generally argued to be in the range 50 - 1000 pa  @xcite .",
    "frank constants for actin nematics appear to be 2 - 20 pn  @xcite , as in ordinary thermotropic nematics .",
    "the thickness @xmath45 of the spread cell in our experiments is about @xmath62 of the lateral extent . for a spread cell area of @xmath63m@xmath12",
    "we therefore estimate @xmath64 m . taken together , this leads to @xmath65 .",
    "however , if attachment - detachment contributions to @xmath42 are included , @xmath3 will be lowered substantially . from the active hydrodynamic model we know  @xcite that the system is quiescent for small values of this parameter .",
    "however , @xmath66 , for which we present the results , is already sufficient to produce a spontaneous flow .",
    "increasing @xmath3 leads to increasingly complicated flows which we have only begun to explore  @xcite .",
    "we do not attempt a detailed comparison between the observed and the theoretical flow patterns .",
    "however , the conclusion about the maximum of the velocity being away from the nucleus rests purely upon the confining geometry , and we expect that the time and angle averaged velocity profile , measured from the experiment , will have a peak away from the nuclear boundary .    for @xmath67",
    "i.e an unbounded , oriented active fluid , one expects  @xcite spontaneous velocity gradients of order @xmath68 . in  @xcite and",
    "@xcite it was shown that the presence of confinement on a scale @xmath45 modifies the above conclusion giving a characteristic rate @xmath69 @xcite where @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the in - plane scale associated with observation . in our case , @xmath72 is @xmath62 .",
    "thus , the rotation rate should be of the order of @xmath73 . using the arguments of @xcite",
    "this estimate turns out to be of the order of a few degrees / min .",
    "this is reassuringly consistent with the magnitude obtained from the experiment .",
    "the two predictions we can make based on this simple model are that actomyosin is crucial for nuclear rotation , and that the angle and time averaged angular velocity will be maximum away from the nucleus .",
    "we perform a series of experiments to check these . in the next sections",
    ", we study the contribution of actomyosin contractility , a critical cytoplasmic regulator of nuclear prestress  @xcite , to the translational and rotational dynamics of the nucleus .",
    "we test the role of contractility on nuclear dynamics to validate the theoretical predictions based on active fluids with an inclusion .",
    "actomyosin contractility was altered by treating cells fully spread on geometric patterns with low concentration of blebbistatin an inhibitor of the myosin ii motor . to determine",
    "if the persistence in nuclear translation motion was dependent on contractility , the autocorrelation function ( acf ) , was plotted for control and blebbistatin treated cells ( figure  [ fig : fig_3]a ) .",
    "blebbistatin treated cells exhibited a decreased correlation time scale for translational motion ( bottom inset to figure  [ fig : fig_3]a , ) suggesting that actomyosin contractility is important for correlated translational movement of the nucleus .",
    "next , the nuclear rotation angle as a function of time was calculated from the xy rotation trajectories .",
    "a typical plot of angle versus time for the nucleus on geometric pattern is shown in supplementary figure  [ fig : s3 ] . on treatment with blebbistatin , the instantaneous angular velocity significantly decreases to 1.0 @xmath74/min when compared to control 1.6 @xmath74/min ( top inset to figure  [ fig : fig_3]a and supplementary figure  [ fig : s4 ] ) . to ascertain the effect of actomyosin contractility on the persistence of nuclear rotation we computed the auto - correlation of angular movement with time .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig_3]b shows plot of auto- correlation curve for control cells and cells treated with blebbistatin .",
    "inset ( below ) to figure  [ fig : fig_3]b show that on perturbing actomyosin contractility , the persistence time of nuclear rotation decreases from 62 min in control to 33 min . in the next section",
    ", we study the role of actin flow patterns in regulating the nuclear dynamics .",
    "live cell fluorescence confocal imaging was carried out to simultaneously visualize actin flow dynamics and nuclear rotation on geometric patterns .",
    "cells were transfected with lifeact - gfp to label actin in live condition ( figure  [ fig : fig_4 ] ) .",
    "time lapse confocal imaging of actin revealed a retrograde flow and its remodeling around the nucleus ( figure  [ fig : fig_4]a ) . to quantify the flow pattern ( supplementary movie 6 )",
    ", we carried out particle image velocimetry ( piv ) analysis using matpiv .",
    "this revealed flow vectors tangential to the nuclear boundary with direction and magnitude correlated with that of the nuclear rotation as shown in figure  [ fig : fig_4]a and supplementary movie 7",
    ". velocity field maps of actin flow were determined in small regions throughout the cell ( figure  [ fig : fig_4]a , last panel and supplementary movie 8) . a circulating flow , required to rotate the nucleus , is clearly seen ( figure  [ fig : fig_4]a , middle panel and supplementary movie 6 and 7 ) .",
    "interestingly , upon blebbistatin treatment , inward flow of actin ( supplementary movie 9 - 11 ) , presumably driven by treadmilling , was not significantly affected .",
    "however , the azimuthal speed can be seen ( figure  [ fig : fig_4]b ) to decrease substantially , despite some scatter in the data .",
    "the circulation of flow around the nucleus was lost concurrent with the loss of nuclear rotation ( figure  [ fig : fig_4]b , middle panel and supplementary movie 10 ) .",
    "further , we plot in figure  [ fig : fig_5]aandb , the angle averaged azimuthal velocity @xmath51 , with and without blebbistatin respectively , inferred from piv as a function of radial distance from the centre of the nucleus . for comparison",
    "we also show the radial velocity , @xmath75 ( figure  [ fig : fig_5 ] c and d ) . note that the graphs start from the edge of the nucleus . as predicted from the theory , the azimuthal velocity peaks away from the nuclear boundary in the control cells . in blebbistatin treated cells , by contrast",
    ", the velocity is 0 , leading to the loss of nuclear rotation .",
    "however , @xmath75 is small in both cases , albeit with slightly larger fluctuations in the presence of blebbistatin .",
    "in addition , time lapse imaging of microtubules labeled with tau - egfp show that the microtubule organizing centre ( mtoc ) undergoes translation dynamics while the nucleus exhibits both translational and rotational dynamics ( supplementary figure  [ fig : s5 ] ) .",
    "the orientation and arrangement of microtubules showed a cage like structure around the nucleus ( supplementary movie 12 ) .",
    "this caging mechanism might help keep the nucleus relatively localized , thus enhancing the rotational effects of the torque generated by the actin flow .",
    "we also visualized the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) to assess its role in nuclear dynamics .",
    "since er is contiguous with the nuclear envelope , it could either stretch or undergo continuous remodeling as the nucleus rotates .",
    "live cell imaging of er , during nuclear rotation , showed dynamic remodeling suggesting a minor role for er in nuclear rotation and reversals ( supplementary figure  [ fig : s6 ] ) .",
    "our results show that geometric constraints are critical in determining the rotational dynamics of the cell nucleus .",
    "while a number of components including cytoskeleton and motor proteins have been implicated to drive nuclear dynamics in migrating cells , our results on single cells confined to specific geometries suggest a role for actomyosin contractility .",
    "square , circular , and triangular pads support mainly rotational motion , while long narrow geometries restrict it .",
    "the shape of the confining geometry further determines the magnitude of nuclear rotation ; a relatively faster rotating nucleus is seen on circular pattern than on squares and triangles .",
    "we offer a simple theoretical explanation for the rotation in which the nucleus is modelled as a nearly rigid inclusion in the cytoplasm treated as a fluid containing filaments endowed with intrinsic stresses .",
    "the result is an angular velocity profile with a maximum at a radial position intermediate between the nucleus and the cell periphery , as observed in the experiments , and nonzero at the nuclear surface , corresponding to nuclear rotation .",
    "the predicted magnitude of the rotation rate based on plausible estimates of material parameters are also consistent with the measurements . that blebbistatin treatment greatly suppresses the flow lends support to our proposed mechanism .",
    "the question arises why nuclei are not universally observed to rotate in cells under normal conditions .",
    "at least two mechanisms could contribute to suppressing the generic instability that leads to circulating flows .",
    "one , in the absence of a rigid geometry , the cell boundary is free to change shape .",
    "this would disrupt the imposed boundary orientation of the filaments , and hence the orderly pattern of active stresses needed to drive a coherent flow .",
    "two , the apical actin fibres @xcite , absent in square and circular geometries , present to some extent in triangular geometries , and very well formed in elongated geometries , bear down on and thus enhance the friction on the nucleus , suppressing its motion .",
    "collectively , our results highlight the importance of both cell geometric constraints and actomyosin contractility in determining nuclear homeostatic balance .",
    "a number of experiments have shown that alterations in cell geometry affect gene expression programs  @xcite and cell cycle time  @xcite , and lead to a switching of cell fates towards apoptosis or proliferation  @xcite .",
    "we hope our work leads to a search for nuclear rotation in a wider range of systems and settings , whether such rotation has biologically significant consequences , and a deeper understanding of how the cell normally suppresses such effects .",

    "<S> the nucleus of the eukaryotic cell functions amidst active cytoskeletal filaments , but its response to the stresses carried by these filaments is largely unexplored . we report here the results of studies of the translational and rotational dynamics of the nuclei of single fibroblast cells , with the effects of cell migration suppressed by plating onto fibronectin - coated micro - fabricated patterns . </S>",
    "<S> patterns of the same area but different shapes and/or aspect ratio were used to study the effect of cell geometry on the dynamics . on circles , squares and equilateral triangles , </S>",
    "<S> the nucleus undergoes persistent rotational motion , while on high - aspect - ratio rectangles of the same area it moves only back and forth . </S>",
    "<S> the circle and the triangle showed respectively the largest and the smallest angular speed . </S>",
    "<S> we show that our observations can be understood through a hydrodynamic approach in which the nucleus is treated as a highly viscous inclusion residing in a less viscous fluid of orientable filaments endowed with active stresses . lowering actin contractility selectively by introducing blebbistatin at low concentrations </S>",
    "<S> drastically reduced the speed and persistence time of the angular motion of the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> time - lapse imaging of actin revealed a correlated hydrodynamic flow around the nucleus , with profile and magnitude consistent with the results of our theoretical approach . </S>",
    "<S> coherent intracellular flows and consequent nuclear rotation thus appear to be a generic property that cells must balance by specific mechanisms in order to maintain nuclear homeostasis . </S>"
