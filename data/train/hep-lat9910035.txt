    "the results presented here are based on the same statistical sample , consisting of 102 quenched configurations at @xmath34 with lattice size @xmath35 , as used in our study of @xmath36 and @xmath37  @xcite .",
    "the details of the nrqcd action , the evolution equation for calculating the heavy quark propagator , the method used for setting the lattice scale , and the fixing of light and strange quark masses are given in  @xcite .",
    "the lattice scale , determined from @xmath38 , is @xmath39 gev , and we consider the range @xmath40 gev to determine the associated uncertainty .",
    "the bare @xmath41 quark mass used in the heavy - light analyses is @xmath42 . from this",
    "we estimate @xmath43 gev . for hadrons containing strange quarks , the central values correspond to fixing @xmath44 using @xmath45 , and for errors we use the difference between it and using @xmath46 .",
    "details of the analyses of the spectrum will appear soon in  @xcite .",
    "overall , our estimates are in rough agreement with experimental data , the one exception being the hyperfine splittings as discussed below .",
    "to understand the various mass splittings , we use the following qualitative picture in which the mass of a heavy - light hadron is considered to be a sum of :    * the pole mass of the heavy quark ( @xmath47 ) which is @xmath48 gev for the @xmath49 quark and @xmath50 gev for the @xmath41 ; * the constituent mass of the light quarks which is approximately @xmath51 mev for the @xmath52 and @xmath53 mev for the @xmath54 quark as inferred from the octet and decuplet light baryons . * for orbitally and radially excited states , an excitation energy of the light quark , which we expect to be of the order of @xmath55 ; * the @xmath56 contributions are the kinetic energy of the heavy quark and the heavy - light hyperfine energy @xmath57 mev , inferred from the experimental @xmath58 splitting ; * and a residual binding energy @xmath59 encapsulating the remaining interactions which we expect to be small ( @xmath60 ) .    to isolate individual terms and estimate their size and dependence on the quark masses we construct different linear combinations of meson and baryon masses .",
    "the spin - averaged splitting @xmath61 should be dominated by the difference of the strange and light quark masses .",
    "we find @xmath62 mev ( the first error includes statistical and extrapolation in quark masses , the second is due to the scale uncertainty , and the third is the variation if @xmath44 is set using @xmath63 instead of @xmath45 ) whereas the experimental value is @xmath64 mev .",
    "the splitting shows no significant dependence on the heavy quark mass , consistent with the expectation that the change in the difference in the kinetic energy of the heavy quark is small .    by a judicious combination of operators and sources for quark propagators we are able to obtain a signal for p - wave states .",
    "the estimates for @xmath65 and @xmath66 are unambiguous as the operators used to probe these states do not mix with other states .",
    "thus , their masses and the splittings @xmath67 mev and @xmath68 mev , are predictions since the @xmath69 states have not been resolved experimentally .",
    "we have used @xmath70 and @xmath71 operators in the @xmath72 coupling scheme to probe the physical @xmath73 and @xmath74 states . in this case",
    "each operator has a non - zero overlap with the two physical states ; consequently to get the physical masses it is essential to get a signal in both the direct and mixed correlators .",
    "since the data show no reliable signal in the mixed correlators , we do not have predictions for the masses of the physical states . in table",
    "[ tab : meson_summary ] , we quote the result from the @xmath70 correlator as a rough estimate for the @xmath73 state .    radial and orbital splittings are expected to be dominated by the difference in kinetic energies of the heavy and light quarks . of these",

    "the results for the hyperfine splittings are not as encouraging .",
    "we find @xmath85 mev and @xmath86 mev , @xmath87 roughly half the experimental values , @xmath88 and @xmath89 mev respectively .",
    "further work is required to clarify whether this discrepancy is due to the quenched approximation or due to an underestimate of the @xmath90 term ( the clover term ) in the action .",
    "our results for baryons are summarized in table  [ tab : baryexp ] .",
    "the first splitting we comment on is @xmath91 . in this",
    "there is no contribution from the heavy quark mass and hyperfine interaction @xmath92 , so it should be dominated by mass of the extra light quark in @xmath93 .",

    "the experimental results , @xmath125 mev and @xmath126 mev ( preliminary ) are consistent with this and suggest negligible dependence on the heavy quark mass .",

    "we present preliminary results based on the same data set as for the heavy - light analyses presented above . to extract the lattice scale we assume that the splittings @xmath145 , @xmath146 , and @xmath147 , are independent of the heavy quark mass .",

    "these results are summarized in table  [ tab : upsilon ] .",
    "typically , the results for mass - splittings with best control over statistical errors are obtained from fits to ratios of correlators . in our data",
    "we find marginally better signal from fits to individual as compared to ratio of correlators ( a consequence of chosing a smearing in heavy quark propagator generation that optimizes signal for heavy - light states ) .",
