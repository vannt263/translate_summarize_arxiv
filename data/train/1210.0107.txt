    "quantum key distribution ( qkd ) provides a means of sharing a secret key between two parties ( alice and bob ) securely in the presence of an eavesdropper ( eve )  .",
    "the single - photon ( e. g. bb84  @xcite ) , entanglement - based ( e. g. e91  @xcite ) and continuous variable ( e. g. gg02 @xcite ) qkd protocols have proved to be unconditionally secure under some ( e. g. source , detection , and post - processing ) assumptions @xcite . in the continuous - variable qkd ( cvqkd ) protocols , information is encoded in quadratures of coherent or squeezed states , and decoded by homodyne or heterodyne detections  @xcite , which have the advantage of only requiring off - the - shelf telecom components  @xcite . besides experimental demonstrations  , the theoretical security of cvqkd has been established against general collective gaussian attacks  @xcite , which has been shown optimal in the asymptotical limit  @xcite . furthermore",
    ", the effect of finite size has been recently investigated in cvqkd protocol  @xcite .",
    "developing qkd protocol resistant to loss and noise is of great practical importance . the cvqkd protocol based on gaussian modulation of coherent",
    "state has been proven to be technically practical  @xcite . however , due to the low reconciliation efficiency for correlated gaussian variables at low snr ( signal to noise ration ) , the maximum transmission distance of cvqkd is quite limited  @xcite .",
    "there are two possible ways to solve this problem .",
    "one is to build good reconciliation algorithms with reasonable efficiency even at low snr for gaussian modulation protocols , where steady progress has been made in recent years  @xcite .",
    "the other is to use discrete modulation cvqkd  @xcite , such as the four - state protocol  @xcite , which has been proved to be secure against collective attacks and have large enough reconciliation efficiency at low snr .",
    "recently , it is very interesting to see that one can improve the maximum transmission distance of gaussian modulation cvqkd protocols dramatically by using a nondeterministic noiseless linear amplifier ( nla )  @xcite . lately",
    ", a method was proposed to improve the secret key rate of four - state cvqkd protocol over long distance by using a phase - sensitive or phase - insensitive optical amplifier , while the maximum transmission distance is decreased  @xcite .",
    "inspired by the methods in  @xcite , we show that the maximum transmission distance and tolerable excess noise of the four - state cvqkd protocol can be increased by using a nla before bob s detection in the presence of a lossy and noisy gaussian channel .",
    "similar to the result in  @xcite , we find that a nla with gain @xmath0 can increase the maximum admissible losses by a factor of @xmath2 . because of the nondeterministic nature of the nla , the security proof here is similar to that in cvqkd protocols with post - selection .",
    "in this section , we firstly describe the prepare - and - measure ( pm ) and entanglement - based ( eb ) version of the four - state cvqkd protocol .",
    "then , the secure key rate for the protocol under collective attack is given in detail .",
    "in the pm version of the four - state cvqkd protocol  @xcite , alice sends randomly one of the four coherent states @xmath3 with probability @xmath4 to bob through a quantum channel , where @xmath5 is chosen to be a real positive number .",
    "bob measures randomly one of the quadratures in homodyne detection , and decodes the information by the sign of his measurement result .",
    "the pm version of the four - state cvqkd protocol can be reformulated in eb version .",
    "alice initially prepare a two - mode entangled state @xmath6 where @xmath7is a non - gaussian orthogonal state , and @xmath8,\\\\   { \\lambda _ { 1,3 } } & = & \\frac{1}{2}{e^ { - { \\alpha ^2}}}[\\sinh ( { \\alpha ^2 } ) \\pm \\sin ( { \\alpha ^2})].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then alice performs a projective measurement @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 on mode a to project mode b on one of the four coherent states @xmath13 randomly , which are then measured by a homodyne detector at bob s side after passing through a quantum channel .",
    "although the eb version does not correspond to the actual implementation , it is fully equivalent to the pm version from the a secure point of view  @xcite , and it provides a powerful description of establishing security proof against collective attacks through the covariance matrix @xmath14 of the state before their respective measurements  @xcite .",
    "the covariance matrix @xmath15 of the state @xmath16 is @xmath17,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 $ ] and @xmath19 $ ] , @xmath20 is variance of quadratures for mode a and b , and @xmath21 reflects the correlation between mode a and mode b. after mode b passing through a gaussian channel with transmittance @xmath22 and equivalent excess noise at the input @xmath23 , the quantum state @xmath16 turns to state @xmath24 with covariance matrix @xmath25,\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the equivalent total noise at the input .",
    "this matrix contains all the information needed to establish the secret key rate for collective attacks for the four - state cvqkd protocol , and the lower bound of secure key rate with reverse reconciliation is  @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 refers here to the mutual information between alice and bob  @xcite , @xmath29 is the holevo bound for the mutual information shared by eve and bob , and @xmath30 is the reconciliation efficiency ( @xmath31 can be reached for arbitrary low snr in the four - state cvqkd protocol  @xcite ) . as shown in  @xcite , @xmath29 is maximized when the state @xmath24 shared by alice and bob is a gaussian state , which means @xmath29 is upper bounded by the same quantity computed for a gaussian state @xmath32 with the same covariance matrix as the state @xmath24 in an eb version of the protocol  @xcite . clearly , one has @xmath33 where @xmath34 , and @xmath35 are the symplectic eigenvalues of the covariance matrix @xmath14 where @xmath36 and @xmath37  @xcite , and @xmath38 is the symplectic eigenvalues of @xmath39 which corresponds to the covariance matrix of alice s state given the result of bob s homodyne measurement  @xcite . finally , the lower bound of secure key rate is @xmath40",
    "inspired by the method in  @xcite , we propose a modified four - state cvqkd protocol by using a nla as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : new scheme](a ) , where alice and bob implement the original four - state cvqkd protocol as usual but bob adds a nla before his homodyne detection , which is here assumed to be perfect for simplify of analysis as in  @xcite .     sent through a gaussian channel with transmittance @xmath22 and excess noise @xmath23 , followed by a successful amplification , has the same covariance matrix @xmath14 than a state @xmath41 sent through a gaussian with transmittance @xmath42 and excess noise @xmath43 without the nla .",
    "the lower bound of secret key rate corresponding to successful amplified events in the modified four - state protocol @xmath44 is the same as that of the virtually equivalent protocol @xmath45.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    a nla can in principle probabilistic amplify the amplitude of a coherent state while retaining the initial level of noise  @xcite .",
    "the successful amplification can be described by an operator @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the photon number operator . when a nla succeeds amplifying a coherent state , @xmath48 where @xmath0 is the amplitude gain of a nla . in the modified four - state cvqkd protocol",
    ", only the events corresponding to a successful amplification will be used to exact a secret key , while the other events are aborted .",
    "since the secure key rate of the protocol depends only on the covariance matrix @xmath14 , it is sufficient to compute it in presence of the nla to estimate the lower bound of secure key rate @xmath49 corresponding to successfully amplified events .    in the following",
    ", we will analysis the performance of the modified four - state cvqkd protocol in two cases : ( i ) a lossy gaussian channel without excess , where one can see directly the effect of the nla ; ( ii ) a lossy and noisy gaussian channel , which is a general and practical case .",

    "since the lower bound of secure key rate under collective attacks is completely determined by the covariance matrix shared by alice and bob , the lower bound of secret key rate @xmath63 corresponding to the successful amplified events is @xmath64 and the lower bound of total secure key rate is @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the probability of successful amplification by a nla .",
    "a direct conclusion is that a nla with amplitude gain @xmath0 can increase the maximum admissible losses of the four - state cvqkd protocol by a factor @xmath2 without excess noise , which is equivalent to improve the maximum transmission distance by @xmath67 km , where @xmath68 for the fiber channel .      after passing through a gaussian channel with transmittance @xmath22 and excess noise @xmath23",
