    "the study of finite type invariants of virtual knots ( see @xcite ) has led to interest in gauss diagrams ( circles with arrows joining distinct pairs of points on it ) and arrow diagrams , which can be thought of as formal sums of gauss diagrams modulo relations that correspond to the virtual reidemeister moves .",
