    "[ sec : intro ]    the study of inclusive hadron production in p+p interactions has a long history .",
    "it has closely followed the steady evolution of particle accelerators towards higher interaction energies as well as the development of novel detector technologies .",
    "although the measurement of particle yields in well - defined regions of the available phase space might seem to be a rather trivial undertaking , the achievement of high precision presents a real challenge to the experimentalist in terms of absolute normalization and the control of systematic effects , in particular concerning the necessary corrections for detector and accelerator connected effects .",
    "the term of `` precision '' has to be defined here very carefully .",
    "in fact a survey of the existing data reveals that it is the evaluation of systematic errors rather than the available event statistics that is the limiting factor .",
    "indeed only a few experiments have achieved cross section measurements with a systematic uncertainty in the one to two percent range .",
    "it is on this level that one may talk about `` high precision '' data , and this performance has shown no real evolution over the past few decades of experimental work .",
    "it is by no means true that the use of state - of - the - art detector technology would automatically ensure superior data quality .",
    "indeed any new attempt at producing `` precision '' data has to take full account of the preceding work .",
    "it is in this sense that this paper presents a critical review of new data on @xmath1 yields produced by the na61 collaboration in the range of beam momenta from 20 to 158  gev / c @xcite . in the introduction to their publication",
    "the authors claim that `` the available data concern mainly basic features of unidentified charged hadrons and they are sparse .",
    "many needed results on hadron spectra are missing '' . and they continue : `` thus new high precision measurements on hadron production properties in p+p interactions are necessary ... '' .",
    "these claims are put to a stringent test in the present comments , and it will be shown that the new data are by no means superior to existing results .",
    "in fact the na61 results are found to be less precise than a set of reference experiments over the full range of the studied beam momenta .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows . after an introduction to the experimental situation concerning inclusive pion production , a set of reference experiments in the range of beam momenta from 12 to 158",
    "gev / c is recalled in sect .",
    "[ sec : ref_exp ] .",
    "section  [ sec : na61 ] describes some aspects of the new na61 results .",
    "a detailed comparison of these data with the published reference experiments follows for the total @xmath1 yields in sect .",
    "[ sec : tot_pim ] , for the @xmath0 integrated rapidity distributions in sect .",
    "[ sec : rap_dist ] and for the double differential cross sections in sect .",
    "[ sec : differential ] . some remarks concerning normalization problems in sect .",
    "[ sec : corr ] conclude the paper .",
    "[ sec : exp_sit ]    most early experiments studying secondary hadron production in p+p interactions have been using hydrogen bubble chambers .",
    "this technique has a decisive advantage over all other detectors in terms of the continuous phase space coverage , perfect absolute normalization and only small corrections for detector related effects .",
    "hence it offers superior performance concerning the systematic uncertainties .    for beam momenta up to about 5  gev / c , the study of fully constrained exclusive final states has been possible using kinematical fitting . above this limit , the transition to inclusive single particle cross sections had to be accepted due to the increased total multiplicity including numerous non - detected neutral hadrons .",
    "this accentuated the inherent weakness of bubble chamber data in terms of particle identification and of the rather sharp limitation in the size of the obtainable data samples .",
    "for the study of @xmath1 production however the former limitation is of less importance in energy regions where the k@xmath2/@xmath1 and @xmath3/@xmath1 ratios remain limited to the few percent level and methods of precise corrections have been developed , especially making use of the complete phase space coverage of the bubble chamber results .",
    "these methods have been employed up to beam momenta of about 70  gev / c .",
    "the alternative detector technique using small solid angle magnetic spectrometers allows for complete particle identification using for instance cerenkov or time - of - flight detectors .",
    "its weaknesses lie in the increased problems around calibration , normalization and corrections as well as in the generally very limited and fractional coverage of the production phase space .",
    "in fact not a single spectrometer experiment has been covering the complete phase space in one set - up .",
    "the introduction of the time projection chamber ( tpc ) as a large solid angle detector permitting combined precision tracking and particle identification has remedied at least part of these problems .",
    "it offers , in fixed target experiments , identification over a major fraction of phase space via energy loss measurement with the exception of the cross - over region between the energy loss of the different particle species at about 13  gev / c laboratory momentum .",
    "this corresponds to different areas in accessible phase space as a function of beam momentum .",
    "in addition tpc detectors need , as they are used in conjunction with targets of beam interaction lengths of at most a few percent , external triggering which introduces non - trivial and sizeable corrections .    in the following sections a number of existing results in the range of beam momenta covered by the na61 experiment will be used as a reference for a detailed comparison with the new data . in this comparison",
    "the following definitions and variables will be used :    * laboratory beam momentum @xmath4 ( gev / c ) * transverse momentum @xmath0 ( gev / c ) * cms energy squared @xmath5 ( @xmath6 = proton mass ) ( gev@xmath7 ) * cms rapidity @xmath8 ( @xmath9 cms longitudinal momentum ) * @xmath10 average number of @xmath1 per inelastic event * transverse mass @xmath11 ( @xmath12 = pion mass ) * invariant inclusive cross section @xmath13 * pion density per inelastic event @xmath14 * @xmath0 integrated pion density @xmath15 per inelastic event",

    "[ fig : meanpi ] that the na61 data lie above the reference results for all values of @xmath4 .",
    "the percent deviation increases with decreasing beam momentum and reaches 7% at @xmath4  =  20  gev / c ( insert of fig .",
    "[ fig : meanpi ] ) .",
    "the deviations which are visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : meanpi ] have direct consequences for the overall precision of the na61 experiment .",
    "if the @xmath1 yield is increased , the h@xmath20 yield has to follow upwards , albeit with a smaller percentage , in order to not violate charge conservation .",
    "this will in turn offset the total charged multiplicity which is measured to a one percent systematic accuracy by most reference experiments .",
    "[ sec : rap_dist ]      [ sec : ref_rap_dist ]    the single differential , @xmath0 integrated rapidity distributions @xmath22 constitute a next step towards a more detailed inspection of the na61 results .",

    "the shaded areas and the dashed lines represent the systematic errors of the reference data and na61 data , respectively , width=434 ]    very substantial deviations appear in this comparison of the single differential distributions .",
    "there is in general a structure with positive deviations at low and high rapidity and an intermediate minimum around @xmath21  =  1.31.5 .",
    "the minimum becomes slightly negative at @xmath4  =  40 and 80  gev / c .",
    "the positive deviations reach typical values of about 6% at low @xmath21 and between 10 and 30% at @xmath23  2 with a clear dependence on beam momentum .",
    "this corresponds to discrepancies of more than 4 standard deviations even compared to the larger na61 errors .",
    "[ sec : gaus_fits ]    the fitting of rapidity distributions with two symmetrically displaced gaussians appears to be a standard procedure of na61 in order to represent their data both for the elementary p+p and for a+a interactions .",
    "it is of course not to be expected that the physics of soft hadron production would satisfy such a simplistic arithmetic parametrization .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",

    "but also within the rapidity range of the na61 measurements there are important systematic differences between data and fit as presented in fig .",

    "it has been repeatedly demonstrated in the na49 publications @xcite that arithmetic formulations are not advisable for data with a precision on the few percent level .",
    "[ sec : differential ]    a final step in the critical assessment of the na61 results consists in scrutinizing the double differential @xmath1 densities @xmath14 in comparison to the reference experiments that have given cross sections as a function of both y and @xmath0 .

    "the inverse slope of a supposedly exponential @xmath27 distribution is generally connected to a thermodynamic quantity called `` hadronic temperature '' .",

    "the value of 180  mev quoted in @xcite ( fig .  18 ) with a systematic error of only 10  mev , will change to 163  mev by changing the fit interval from 0.2  @xmath33  0.7  gev / c@xmath7 to 0.1  @xmath33  0.6  gev / c@xmath7 while the same change in the p+p data will keep the @xmath34 value stable to within 1  mev .",
    "in addition it should be recalled that the inverse slopes have to diverge upwards in the approach to @xmath32  =  @xmath0  =  0 as the invariant cross section crosses this value with slope zero .",
    "[ sec : corr ]    given the large discrepancies between the na61 results and the set of reference experiments described above , it should be mandatory to localize apparative and experimental effects that might be responsible for the observed problems .",
    "this would concern in particular the size of the corrections to the raw data and the way the results are normalized .",
    "unfortunately there are no quantitative informations available in @xcite with respect to these important ingredients to the data analysis .",
    "the reader might use the repeated statement that the systematic errors are enumerated as 20 - 40% of the applied corrections to estimate that the corresponding corrections might reach values of up to or bigger than 50% . concerning the absolute normalization the statement concerning a change of the target density with time in sect .  3 of the paper @xcite",
    "would indicate that the standard normalization via a model - independent direct measurement of the trigger cross section @xcite was impossible , see also the comments in @xcite .",
    "instead the normalization has to rely completely on the comparison to a microscopic model @xcite .",
    "the event losses due to the interaction trigger of na61 are almost completely located in the diffractive sector of the strong interaction , a sector that is notoriously ill described by the standard microscopic models as those do not contain the production and cascading decays of n@xmath35 resonances which dominate this region of phase space .",
    "furthermore , the used production model will not only have to describe exactly the inclusive yields of forward particles hitting the trigger counter , but also the correlation of these particles with secondary @xmath1 in order to quantify the correction to be applied at lower rapidity .",
    "this correction is strongly dependent on @xmath0 and @xmath21 @xcite . in this context",
    "the statement that `` the results presented in this paper are determined from particle yields per selected event '' does not take into account that all reference yields discussed in the present comments are referred to the total inelastic cross section and not to an undetermined trigger cross section .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ]    new data on negative pion production from the na61 collaboration in the range of beam momenta from 20 to 158  gev / c have been compared to a wide range of reference data in the same energy region .",
    "important deviations of the new data from the existing results have been revealed .",
    "these discrepancies increase in the successive steps from the total pion yields via the single differential rapidity distributions to the double differential invariant cross sections .",
