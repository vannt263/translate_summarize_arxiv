    "in his celebrated 1859 note about the prime counting function @xmath1 , riemann concludes    _ the thickening and thinning of primes which is represented by the periodic term in the formula has also been observed in the counts of primes , without , however , any possibility of establishing a law for it having been noticed . it would be interesting in a future count to examine the influence of individual periodic terms in the formula for the density of primes @xcite_.    it is known that the periodic terms @xmath13 at the critical zeros @xmath5 of the riemann zeta function @xmath6 are responsible for the inaccuracy of riemann prime counting function @xmath3 ( where @xmath14 is the moebius function ) in the approximation of @xmath1 , the number of primes up to @xmath0 ( * ? ? ? * eq .",
    "( 4 ) ) @xmath15    but even the account of the first @xmath16 periodic terms performed in the approximation of @xmath17 is not able to improve the approximation @xmath18 , we mean its integer part @xmath19 . ] by more that one digit @xcite @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 means @xmath24 .",
    "in contrast , in @xcite , we introduced a different approach where the account of the periodic terms is performed in a global way as @xmath25 $ ] so that one obtains @xmath26 an almost three digit improvement over the approximation by the logarithmic integral .",
    "similarly , we are able to improve gram formula ( * ? ? ? * eq . ( 70 ) ) @xmath27 from the approximation @xmath28 $ ] so that @xmath29    this improvement is observed at all values @xmath10 , @xmath30 , where @xmath1 is exactly known ( see sec .",
    "one is fortunate to have now at our disposal two distinct ( but closely related and surprisingly almost equal ) formulas @xmath31 and @xmath32 to approximate the prime counting function in the unknown range of values such as @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "we can use either formula to explore the unknown range of values such as @xmath35 , @xmath34 .",
    "specifically    @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath39 means @xmath40 .    in this short paper , we pursue the calculations of @xmath41 started in @xcite and compare it to the gram formula based approximation @xmath32 by having recourse to the explicit von mangoldt formula for the chebyshev function @xmath9 and taking into account the first @xmath42 critical zeros of the riemann zeta function @xcite .",
    "these calculations are well in the spirit of the aforementioned quote of riemann since the approximate value of @xmath1 explicitly depends on the zeros @xmath5 through @xmath9 .",
    "the function @xmath43 $ ] also relates to riemann hypothesis through the modified robin s criterion ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 2),@xcite so that we are close to this important topic as well .",
    "it is claimed in the introduction that @xmath31 and @xmath32 provide a much better fit ( two to four digits better ) than @xmath45 .",
    "it also provides a much better fit than the gram formula for @xmath46 as shown below .",
    "we used the first @xmath47 zeros @xmath5 calculated in @xcite to evaluate @xmath9 and the corresponding approximations @xmath31 and @xmath32 from the explicit von mangoldt formula @xmath48 @xmath49 when @xmath0 is not a prime power and @xmath50 , @xmath51 the von mangoldt function , otherwise @xcite.[multiblock footnote omitted ]    the difference @xmath52 at powers of @xmath33 , @xmath44 $ ] is the sequence",
    "a215663    @xmath53    the sequence @xmath54 reads @xmath55 as for the sequence @xmath56 , one gets @xmath57    clearly the shift from @xmath1 of the approximation @xmath31 and @xmath32 is lower , sometimes with two orders of magnitude , than the shift from @xmath46 with respect to @xmath1 , as expected .",
    "it turns out that @xmath58 at all powers of @xmath59 up to @xmath60 .",
    "but there exists plenty values of @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "this occurs over thick intervals starting at squares of primes @xmath63 with @xmath64 .",
    "the first @xmath65 primes in this sequence are associated with prime gaps ( oeis sequence a134266 ) but the rest is not recognized and quite random .",

    "an approach to approximate @xmath68 is given in @xcite .",
    "it is already interesting to guarantee which digits of @xmath2 are exact and which ones can be added .",
    "our approximation based on @xmath69 defined in the introduction allows to solve this challenge as soon as a sufficient number of critical zeros of @xmath6 are taken into account . as before",
    ", we used the first @xmath42 zeros calculated in @xcite to evaluate @xmath9 and the corresponding approximations of @xmath1 .",
    "the results are listed below . in the array ,",
    "the prefix that belongs to @xmath2 is denoted @xmath70 and three to four exact digits that do not belong to @xmath45 can be guaranteed ; for further comments compare the evaluation of @xmath71 shown in the introduction .",
    "to check the validity of prime counting functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 it is good to compute them at values where the chebyshev function @xmath9 is exactly known , that is , irrespectively of the knowledge of the critical zeros @xmath5 .",
    "exact values of @xmath9 at selected high values of @xmath0 , with @xmath73 are given in @xcite .",
    "in this subsection we restrict to the calculation of the gram formula based approximation @xmath32 . but similar observations hold for @xmath31 .    in the following two lists , @xmath74 is calculated from the ( almost ) exact values of @xmath9 and @xmath32 is calculated from the explicit formula with @xmath42 critical zeros .",

    "@xmath80    @xmath81    it is clear that , while the shifts are almost equal ( and very small ) at the beginning of the lists , they are higher at the end of the lists , and they differ substantially ( about one order of magnitude ) in the two .",
    "these calculations reinforce our confidence in the efficiency of the prime counting function @xmath32 in that the remaining inaccuracy of @xmath32 partially arises from the possible inacurracy of the calculation of @xmath9 by the explicit formula .",
    "unfortunately , at high values of @xmath0 , the time for computing @xmath9 becomes as prohibitive as the time for computing @xmath1 @xcite , and this is why the approximation of @xmath9 based on the explicit formula remains extremely useful .",
    "looking at the relative error @xmath82/\\pi(x)$ ] compared to @xmath83/\\pi(x)$ ] , over the range of the above explored values @xmath84 , one gets @xmath85 but the average ratio @xmath86 is about @xmath87 .",
    "this represents an improvement of about three orders of magnitude of the prime counting function @xmath32 compared to @xmath2 . depending on the selected value of @xmath0",
    ", three to four new exact digits are obtained from @xmath32 compared to @xmath2 as shown in the previous sections .",
    "littlewood established that the function @xmath89 changes sign infinitely often .",
    "but it is known not to occur before @xmath90 , a so - called skewes number @xcite .",
    "asymptotically , one has @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the first chebyshev function .",

    "as we arrived at the excellent counting functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 , themselves functions of @xmath9 and thus explicitly related to the zeros of @xmath5 of the riemann zeta function , it is quite satisfactory to be back to the spirit of riemann s program of counting the prime numbers .",
