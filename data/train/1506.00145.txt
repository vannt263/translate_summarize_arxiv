    "one of the key relations in cosmology is the cosmic distance duality relation ( cddr ) , which expresses a connection between two observables : the luminosity distance @xmath1 and the angular diameter distance @xmath2 through    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the redshift of the source .",
    "although it appears to be a fortuitous relation in an flrw ( friedmann  lematre  robertson  walker ) universe in many textbooks , it was actually derived by etherington long ago @xcite , where its validity implies photon number is conserved , gravity is described by a metric theory and light propagates on unique null geodescis @xcite . therefore , any violation of this relation is a clear indication of new physics .",
    "approaches to test the cddr in the recent literature assume a cosmological model suggested by a set of observations ( usually the @xmath5cdm concordance model ) and check the validity of the cddr in the context of some astrophysical effect .",
    "examples of these methods are given by @xcite .",
    "other tests have been proposed with the goal of testing effectively such relation , involving from luminosity distances of type ia supernovae , angular diameter distances of galaxy clusters , gas mass fractions of galaxy clusters , the blackness of the cosmic microwave background and gamma - ray bursts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "generally , departures from the relation are written as @xmath6 , where for @xmath7 is adopted simple parametric forms as @xmath8 or @xmath9 .",
    "an interesting test for the distance duality relation was recently proposed by @xcite , where one can write @xmath10 , @xmath11 standing for the gas mass fraction of a galaxy cluster measured through the sunyaev - zeldovich effect @xcite and @xmath12 for the gas mass fraction obtained calculating the gas mass observed in x - rays divided by the total mass assuming hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the method has some advantages comparing to other approaches : as the same object is used to determine @xmath7 , there are no problems of comparing distances in completely different regions of the sky where inhomogeneities can be important , as well as it is easier to grasp systematic errors . considering the two standard parametrizations for @xmath7 described above , no violation for the relation was the derived for a subset well described by hydrostatic equilibrium .    in this paper ,",
    "two new tests are proposed based on the distance to galaxy clusters from the esz / x - ray technique , x - ray gas mass fraction and @xmath0 measurements .",
    "the use of @xmath0 measurements allows a model - independent test , overcoming difficulties when using galaxy cluster and type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) due to a dependence on a cosmological model and the hubble constant when using sne ia @xcite .",
    "also , another advantage of our tests is that they rely on data coming from the observation of the same galaxy clusters , which allow us to search for new physics as well as to check the consistency of the hypotheses adopted in such observations .",
    "as we shall see , the results are derived using gaussian processes , a non - parametric method which does not restrict a functional form for @xmath13 , where both methods fully agree with the standard value @xmath14 in all redshift range covered by data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ samples ] we describe the sample used in the work .",
    "sections [ methods ] and [ gp ] details the methods and the non - parametric approach adopted , respectively .",

    "in order derive constraints for @xmath7 free from parametrizations we use :    \\(a ) 38 gas mass fraction of galaxy clusters from @xcite spanning redshifts from @xmath15 to @xmath16 , derived from chandra x - ray data .",
    "these authors used the non - isothermal double @xmath17-model for gas distribution .",

    "\\(b ) 38 angular diameter distance from galaxy clusters obtained from their sunyaev - zeldovich and x - ray observations ( the so - called sze / x - ray technique ) .",
    "the sample is in redshift range is @xmath18 and was compiled by @xcite where the cluster plasma and dark matter distributions were analyzed assuming a non - isothermal spherical double @xmath17 model .",
    "the galaxy clusters of this sample are exactly the same of @xcite .",
    "\\(c ) 28 hubble parameter versus redshift data points , @xmath0 , from cosmic chronometers , baos and a local measurement in redshifts up to @xmath19 @xcite . for a compilation of @xmath0 measurements",
    "see e.g. @xcite .",
    "while the item ( c ) in the earlier section is insensitive with respect the cosmic duality relation validity , the astronomical observations in items ( a ) e ( b ) are dependent through different ways . in our analysis we use two methods to obtain constraints on @xmath7 , namely :      the gas mass fraction of galaxy clusters is given by @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the gas mass and @xmath22 is the total mass ( including dark matter ) of the galaxy cluster . as it is known , along with the assumption of a constant @xmath23 with redshift it is possible to test different cosmological scenarios .",
    "however , in a recent paper , @xcite showed that the gas mass fraction is dependent on @xmath7 value .",
    "these authors deduced a more general expression for the gas mass fraction given by @xmath24\\;.\\ ] ] by using a general version of equation ( 1 ) ( @xmath25 ) was obtained : @xmath26,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the normalization factor that carries all the information about the matter content in the cluster and the quantities with the subscript * correspond to those used in the observations ( concordance model where @xmath14 ) . in this way , it is possible to define @xmath28\\;.\\ ] ] in our analysis , @xmath2 is obtained directly from @xmath0 measurements , as it will be explained later .",
    "it is important to stress that the test for @xmath7 proposed here is independent of the assumption of a constant @xmath23 with redshift since we are interested in @xmath2 from each cluster separately and not from its distribution over @xmath4 .",
    "the sources of uncertainty in the measurement of @xmath23 to the galaxy cluster samples are : i ) the statistical errors concerning to the x - ray and sze observations comprehend known effects : sze point sources @xmath29 , kinetic sz @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 for cluster asphericity to @xmath23 from x - ray and sze observations , respectively , ii ) the systematic errors for the galaxy clusters are : x - ray absolute flux calibration @xmath33 , x - ray temperature calibration @xmath34 , sze calibration @xmath30 and a one - sided systematic uncertainty of @xmath35 to the total masses which accounts for the assumed hydrostatic equilibrium ( see subsection 5 in @xcite ) . in our analysis",
    "the systematic errors will be add in quadrature to statistical errors @xcite .",
    "as it is largely known , the x - ray emission of the intracluster galaxy medium can be combined with the sunyaev - zeldovich effect to estimate the angular diameter distance ( add ) .",
    "the main advantage of this method is being fully independent of any local calibrator . in the context of this phenomenon ,",
    "the angular diameter distance is such that @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the central x - ray surface brightness , @xmath38 is the central temperature of the intra - cluster medium , @xmath39 is the central x - ray cooling function of the intra - cluster medium , @xmath40 is the central decrement temperature , and @xmath41 refers to a characteristic scale of the cluster along the line of sight ( l.o.s . ) , whose exact meaning depends on the assumptions adopted to describe the galaxy cluster morphology .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that this technique is heavily dependent on the cosmic distance duality relation . if one assumes a deformed expression such as equation ( 1 ) ( @xmath42 ) it is possible to obtain that @xmath43 this quantity is reduced to the standard angular diameter distance only when the cddr relation is strictly valid ( @xmath14 ) . in this way , it is possible to define @xmath44 in our analysis , @xmath45 is obtained directly from @xmath0 measurements . the sources of uncertainty in the measurement of @xmath46(z ) to the galaxy cluster samples are : i ) statistical contributions : sze point sources @xmath47% , x - ray background @xmath48% , galactic n@xmath49 @xmath50 , @xmath51% for cluster asphericity , @xmath47% kinetic sz and for cmb anisotropy @xmath52 , ii ) estimates for systematic effects are as follow : sz calibration @xmath47% , x - ray flux calibration @xmath53% , radio halos @xmath54% and x - ray temperatute calibration @xmath55% ( see table 3 in @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath0 measurements were derived from the following physical observables : cosmic chronometers @xcite , baryon acoustic oscillations obtained from the clustering of galaxies @xcite and from the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) @xcite .",
    "the method of cosmic chronometers @xcite is based on the relative age of a galaxy population at different redshifts . as @xmath56 , for spectroscopic redshifts with interval @xmath57 , a measured age difference @xmath58 provides a direct inference of @xmath0 .",
    "note that this measurement is independent of absolute ages as well as the metric considered .",
    "the error budget considered is a combination of statistical and systematic errors , whereas the former is due to the calibration relation to infer the ages and the latter is due to metallicity , stellar population synthesis model and star formation history .",
    "other sources of systematic errors are not relevant given the size of the other errors , as progenitor bias , initial mass function and @xmath59-enhancement .",
    "the values of @xmath0 derived by @xcite come from the baryon acoustic oscillations ( baos ) , while the ones obtained by @xcite come from combining the baos with the alcock - paczinsky test @xcite .",
    "the baos come from the sound waves propagating in the photon - baryon fluid in the early universe .",
    "after the decoupling , these modes were frozen and a preferred scale was imprinted on the distribution of matter , which can be detected analyzing the distribution of objects as galaxies .",
    "this scale is the sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch , so it can be determined from observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation . by measuring this scale , which is a standard ruler , at transversal and radial directions ,",
    "one is able to derive the angular diameter distance and the hubble parameter , respectively .",
    "the alcock - paczinsky test relies on comparing the radial and transversal sizes of objects assumed to be isotropic .",
    "equating their sizes , one is able to derive constraints on a combination of angular diameter distance and hubble parameter independently of a standard ruler .",
    "both tests are weakly dependent on the adopted cosmological model , therefore it can be used in cosmological tests .",
    "@xcite estimated the impact from systematic errors in the measurement of the correlation function as well as the bao peak location , where simulations were extensively used .",
    "possible sources of systematics include the choice of radial selection function , finite volume effects and the accuracy of the statistical error model . in this work we considered the statistical and systematic errors obtained in @xcite .",
    "@xcite discarded possible sources of systematic errors as much smaller than statistical errors , as modelling redshift - space distortions , varying fitting range for the bao peak and implementation of a quasi - linear model .",
    "also , comparison with constraints coming from simulations found no evidence of systematic errors .",
    "we follow the methodology firstly presented by @xcite where one transforms @xmath0 measurements into cosmological distance estimates by solving numerically the comoving distance integral for non - uniformly spaced data , i.e. , @xmath60,\\ ] ] since the error on @xmath4 measurements is negligible , we only take into account the uncertainty on the values of @xmath0 ( the error from the method itself is also completely negligible compared to the errors of @xmath0 ) . as one may check , by using standard error propagation techniques , the error associated to the @xmath61 bin",
    "is given by @xmath62 so that the error of the integral ( [ eq2 ] ) in the interval @xmath63  @xmath64 is @xmath65 .",
    "thus , we use 28 independent @xmath0 measurements @xcite in the redshift range @xmath66 .    as one may see ,",
    "the comoving distance obtained from this technique is completely independent of the cosmic distance duality relation .",
    "we restrict our analysis to the flat case , in this way the add in methods ( i ) and ( ii ) is @xmath67 .",
    "moreover , since the galaxy clusters and @xmath0 observations are performed at different @xmath4 , we calculate @xmath68 at each galaxy cluster redshift from a polynomial fit of the @xmath68 from @xmath0 points shown in fig .",
    "( 1 ) . in fig . ( 2 )",
    "we show the @xmath69 values for each method by using equations ( 5 ) and ( 8) . for method ( i )",
    "we marginalize over the parameter @xmath27 .",
    "it is important to stress that all systematical errors are being considered .",
    "gaussian processes ( gps ) is a non - parametric method which allows one to reconstruct a function without specifying a form for it .",
    "gps generalize the notion of a gaussian random variable for a random function , being characterized by a mean and a covariance function .",
