    "understanding wave propagation in granular media is a fundamental issue in many contexts , e.g. to design shock absorbers @xcite , derive multiple impact laws @xcite , detect buried objects by acoustic sensing @xcite , or understand possible dynamical mechanisms of earthquake triggering @xcite .",
    "one of the important factors that influence wave propagation is the nature of elastic interactions between grains . according to hertz s theory , the repulsive force @xmath0 between two identical initially tangent spherical beads compressed with a small relative displacement @xmath1 is @xmath2 at leading order in @xmath1 , where @xmath3 depends on the ball radius and material properties and @xmath4 ( see figure [ boules ] ) .",
    "this result remains valid for much more general geometries ( smooth non - conforming surfaces ) , and @xmath5 can be even larger in the presence of irregular contacts @xcite .",
    "the hertz contact force has several properties that make the analytical study of wave propagation more difficult than in classical systems of interacting particles : the dependency of @xmath6 on @xmath7 is fully nonlinear for @xmath8 , @xmath9 is not defined for @xmath10 , and no force is present when beads are not in contact .",
    "this makes the use of perturbative methods rather delicate , since the latter often rely on nonlinear modulation of linear waves which are not present in such systems , and usually require higher regularity of nonlinear terms .",
    "schematic representation of two identical and initially tangent spherical beads that are compressed and slightly flatten , the distance between their centers decreasing by @xmath7 . ]",
    "the simplest model in which these difficulties show up consists of a line of identical spherical beads , in contact with their neighbours at a single point when the chain is at rest . for an infinite chain of beads ,",
    "the dynamical equations read in dimensionless form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the displacement of the @xmath13th bead from a reference position and the interaction potential @xmath14 corresponds to hertz contact forces .",
    "it takes the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the heaviside function vanishing on @xmath17 and equal to unity on @xmath18 and @xmath8 is a fixed constant .",
    "system ( [ vhertz ] ) is hamiltonian with total energy @xmath19 for @xmath4 , nesterenko analyzed the propagation of compression pulses in this system using a formal continuum limit and found approximate soliton solutions with compact support @xcite ( see also @xcite for more recent results and references ) . as shown by mackay @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) , exact solitary wave solutions of ( [ nc ] ) exist since an existence theorem of friesecke and wattis @xcite can be applied to the chain of beads with hertz contact forces ( see also @xcite for an alternate proof ) .",
    "moreover these solitary waves have in fact a doubly - exponential decay @xcite that was approximated by a compact support in nesterenko s analysis .",
    "much more analytical results are available on nonlinear waves in the granular chain when an external load @xmath20 is applied at both ends and all beads undergo a small compression @xmath21 when the system is at rest . around this new equilibrium state ,",
    "the dynamical equations correspond to a fermi - pasta - ulam ( fpu ) lattice @xcite , that sustains in particular stable solitary waves with exponential decay ( see e.g. @xcite ) and periodic travelling waves also known as ",
    "nonlinear phonons \" @xcite .",
    "the existence and qualitative properties of periodic travelling waves in granular chains are important elements in the understanding of energy propagation and dispersive shocks in these systems , as shown in reference @xcite in the similar context of fpu lattices",
    ". however , the persistence of periodic travelling waves when @xmath22 is not obvious because the sound velocity ( i.e. the maximal velocity of linear waves ) vanishes as @xmath23 , and the uncompressed chain of beads is commonly denoted as a  sonic vacuum \" @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show that periodic travelling waves with unusual properties exist in granular chains under hertz contacts without precompression .",
    "these waves consist of packets of compressed beads alternating with packets of uninteracting ones , so that any given bead periodically switches between a free flight regime and a contact regime where it interacts nonlinearly with two or one neighbours .",
    "waves of this type have been numerically computed in reference @xcite , for periodic granular chains consisting of three or four beads . here",
    "we provide an existence theorem valid at wavenumbers close to @xmath24 and proceed by numerical continuation when the wavenumber goes from @xmath24 to the long wave limit @xmath25 .",
    "the limit @xmath26 corresponds to binary oscillations , i.e. travelling waves with spatial period @xmath27 where nearest neighbours oscillate out of phase . in the long wave limit",
    ", the periodic waves display small compression regions close to solitary waves , alternating with large domains of free flight where bead velocities are small .",
    "our existence result for periodic travelling waves close to binary oscillations is described in the following theorem . in what follows",

    "it takes the form @xmath52,\\ ] ] with @xmath53 .",
    "when @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) , the @xmath13th particle performs a free flight characterized by @xmath56    to prove theorem [ existence ] , we locally solve equation ( [ adthm ] ) using the implicit function theorem , where we have to pay a particular attention to regularity issues due to the limited smoothness of the interaction potential @xmath14 .",
    "this approach is reminiscent of the previous work @xcite , where we proved the existence of periodic travelling waves in the newton s cradle , a mechanical system in which the granular chain is modified by attaching each bead to a local linear pendulum .",
    "however , in that case the periodic travelling waves were obtained by nonlinear modulation of linear oscillations in the local potentials , a limit which does not exist in the present situation .    a complementary approach to the analysis of exact periodic travelling waves consists of obtaining approximate solutions described by continuum models .",
    "approximate periodic travelling waves have been previously studied through a formal continuum limit in the granular chain ( see @xcite , sections 1.3 - 5 , @xcite , section 4.6 and references therein ) , but in a case where all beads were interacting under compression .",
    "closer to our case , whitham s modulation equation may be used to approximate the solutions of theorem [ existence ] and study their stability properties , following the lines of reference @xcite where the example of a granular chain with linear contact interactions was analyzed .",
    "a limitation of theorem [ existence ] stems from the fact that it provides an existence result for wavenumbers @xmath57 close to @xmath24 . to analyze the existence of periodic travelling waves on a full range of wavenumbers , we numerically continue ( for @xmath58 ) the solutions of theorem [ existence ] by decreasing the wavenumber @xmath59 down to values close to @xmath37 .",
    "we compute the nonlinear dispersion relation associated to periodic travelling waves , and analyze their asymptotic form in the long wave limit @xmath60 . in this limit and",
    "when the wave velocity is normalized to unity , one finds large ensembles of beads performing a free flight at small velocity , separated by smaller regions consisting of @xmath61-@xmath62 balls under compression with relative displacements close to a solitary wave . using a matching technique , we perform a formal asymptotic study of the limit @xmath25 which provides a limiting wave profile in good agreement with our numerical computations .",
    "these results are completed by a stability analysis .",
    "we compute the floquet spectrum modulo shifts of the periodic travelling waves , and find fast linear instabilities below a critical wavenumber @xmath63 .",
    "this threshold corresponds to the case when the average number of interacting beads in the compression regions becomes larger or equal to three , or equivalently to the maximal number of adjacent interacting beads becoming @xmath64 . in this regime ,",
    "the initial numerical errors made on the travelling wave profiles are amplified during dynamical simulations , leading to the disappearance of the travelling waves after some transcient time .",
    "a disordered regime is established shortly after the instability , but interestingly some partial order can be still observed in the form of intermittent large - scale organized structures .",
    "in contrast to the above situation , long - time dynamical simulations of periodic travelling waves with wavenumbers @xmath65 yield wave profiles that remain practically unchanged when propagating along the lattice . the existence of very slow instabilities in this regime is a more delicate question which will be addressed in a future work .",
    "besides periodic waves , our numerical results also demonstrate the existence of compactons ( solitary waves with compact supports ) in chains of beads separated by equal gaps outside the compression wave . for @xmath66 , the periodic solutions of ( [ adthm ] ) obtained numerically behave linearly on intervals of length larger than the delay @xmath57 involved in ( [ adthm ] ) , and these solutions",
    "can be linearly extended in order to get new solutions of ( [ adthm ] ) .",
    "using this property and the galilean invariance of ( [ nc ] ) , we obtain compacton solutions for which the beads are stationary and separated by equal gaps outside the wave , and each bead reached by the wave is shifted by a finite distance during a finite time interval .",
    "our situation is quite different to what occurs in the absence of gaps between beads , because in that case compactons exist in continuum models of granular chains @xcite , but a transition from compactons to noncompact ( super - exponentially localized ) solutions occurs when passing from the continuum model to the discrete lattice @xcite . in our case the existence of compactons is linked with the occurence of free flight , made possible by the unilateral character of hertzian interactions which vanish when beads are not in contact .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ localcont ]",
    "we prove theorem [ existence ] and study some qualitative properties of the travelling wave profiles .",
    "the numerical results are presented in section [ num ] , which contains in addition a formal asymptotic study of the long wave limit and the discussion of the existence of compactons .",
    "section [ disc ] gives a summary of the main results and mentions implications for other works .",
    "lastly , some useful properties of solitary wave solutions are recalled in an appendix .",
    "periodic travelling wave solutions of ( [ nc ] ) take the form @xmath67 where @xmath32 is @xmath29-periodic , @xmath68 denotes the wavenumber , @xmath69 the wave frequency and @xmath70 the spatial coordinate in a frame moving with the wave .",
    "thanks to a scale invariance of ( [ nc ] ) , the full set of periodic travelling waves can be deduced from its restriction to @xmath71 .",
    "indeed , due to the special form of the hertz potential ( [ vhertz ] ) , any solution @xmath72 of ( [ nc ] ) generates two families of solutions @xmath73 parametrized by @xmath74 .",
    "consequently , any solution of the form ( [ tw ] ) with @xmath71 corresponds to two families of periodic travelling waves propagating in opposite directions @xmath75 with frequency @xmath76 .",
    "fixing @xmath71 , equation ( [ nc ] ) yields the advance - delay differential equation @xmath77 with periodic boundary conditions @xmath78 equation ( [ ad ] ) possesses the symmetry @xmath79 originating from the reflectional and time - reversal symmetries of ( [ nc ] ) . in the sequel",
    "we restrict our attention to solutions of ( [ ad ] ) invariant under this symmetry ( i.e. odd in @xmath49 ) .",
    "this assumption simplifies our continuation procedure , because it eliminates a degeneracy of periodic travelling waves linked with the invariance of ( [ ad ] ) under translations and phase - shift .",

    "this phenomenon can be intuitively understood through the results of @xcite , where the travelling wave stability was numerically established for a three - ball chain ( with fixed center of mass ) using poincar sections . however , as it follows from our numerical results , the interactions of the three - ball packets with additional beads generate instabilities as soon as @xmath591 .",
    "the weakness of the linear instability for @xmath60 is consistent with the convergence of the travelling waves towards the classical hertzian solitary wave ( section [ longw ] ) , given the fact that the hertzian solitary wave appears structurally robust in dynamical simulations .",

    "the instability of the travelling waves is observed up to the long wave limit , where it manifests differently from the instability at @xmath593 .",
    "a slow dispersion of the compression pulse occurs ( see figure [ shockbis ] , top right plot ) , and subsequent collisions of dispersive waves with the shock generate a fast instability . a closer view of the transition from dispersive travelling waves to spatiotemporal disorder is provided by the lower plot of figure [ shockbis ] . in these different examples ,",
    "we interpret the abrupt transition to a disordered regime as the result of the large number of unstable modes .",

    "<S> we prove the existence of such waves close to binary oscillations , and numerically continue these solutions when their wavelength is increased . in the long wave limit </S>",
    "<S> , we observe their convergence towards shock profiles consisting of small compression regions close to solitary waves , alternating with large domains of free flight where bead velocities are small . </S>",
    "<S> we give formal arguments to justify this asymptotic behaviour , using a matching technique and previous results concerning solitary wave solutions . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical finding of such waves implies the existence of compactons , i.e. compactly supported compression waves propagating at a constant velocity , depending on the amplitude and width of the wave . </S>",
    "<S> the beads are stationary and separated by equal gaps outside the wave , and each bead reached by the wave is shifted by a finite distance during a finite time interval . below a critical wavenumber , we observe fast instabilities of the periodic travelling waves leading to a disordered regime .    </S>",
