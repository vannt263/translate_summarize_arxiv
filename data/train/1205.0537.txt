    "making cities easy to navigate without maps or electronic devices is a desirable objective ( although certainly not the only one ) for urban planning . based on models of how humans find their way in a partially unknown environment",
    ", one can evaluate street maps and choose where to put new streets to optimize them for better navigability .",
    "the setup for such a simulation is to assume every pair of start and finish points for a navigator with partial information and measure the ratio between the shortest path length and the actual path length . in the previous work of ours , an index defined by",
    "the ratio is within the range @xmath0 $ ] with @xmath1 representing a worst and @xmath2 a perfect navigability of _ given _ spatial graph layouts  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we instead focus on _ designing _ optimal transport systems for such concept of navigability under limited resources , which is an important engineering problem and , mathematically , a typical example of the constraint optimization problem  @xcite where it is well - known that finding the exact optimum of such systems is hard .",
    "the problem gets even more complicated if the measure or object function to be optimized is not exactly given .",
    "constructing transport networks on which real navigators move precisely correspond to this situation , due to the fact that the navigability considering real navigators behavior is not given as a simple mathematical description  @xcite .",
    "our idea of modeling real navigators behavior is essentially exploiting the spatial information on a local level , and thus it can be modeled as a simple greedy routing strategy  @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "our main idea on this work is to use the performance of a simple greedy routing scheme called greedy spatial navigation ( gsn ) based on the directional information that we have introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , along with the real shortest path navigation ( spn ) for comparison , to optimize the interconnected structures for a given distribution of vertices on two - dimensional ( 2d ) space under limited resources , i.e. , the total length of edges  @xcite . in gsn , briefly speaking , agents move in a direction as close as possible to the direction of the target .",
    "if they reach a dead end , they backtrack to the previous point where they have an untested choice of route .",
    "the agents in spn , on the other hand , always follow the optimal route minimizing the total path distance connecting the source and the target . instead of solving the mathematically cumbersome nondeterministic polynomial time ( np)-complete problem of finding the exactly optimal configurations , we focus on the realistic approach of constructing _ shortcuts _ greedily from a spanning tree structure as the skeleton  @xcite .    based on the simulation results from a simple shortcut construction scheme starting with randomly distributed vertices to be connected , we first find that the type of metric ( hopping vs.  euclidean distance ) is crucial to determine the final structures .",
    "in addition , the type of navigability ( shortest vs.  gsn path length ) also plays an important role , which is reflected by the different degree of inefficiency caused by greedy navigators between those cases .",
    "the difference between the two navigability measures is quite prominent if we allow the crossing among edges , which leads to the unrealistic edge condensation for the shortest path length but only the fat - tailed degree distribution for the gsn path length .",
    "the aim of the model is to construct navigability - friendly structures under the constraint of resources given by the total length of the edges .",
    "this fully deterministic model only depends on the initial configuration of vertices without any free parameter involved .",
    "first , assume that we have a set of vertices in a 2d space with their coordinates given , without any prescribed edges . to guarantee the connectivity and minimum initial resource , the minimum spanning tree ( mst ) @xmath3 , which is the connected subtree minimizing the total length of edges ,",
    "is generated with kruskal s algorithm  @xcite .",
    "this @xmath3 is the initial state of the evolving graph @xmath4 so that @xmath5 .",
    "we define the navigability as the path length averaged over all the pairs of vertices as sources and targets .",
    "the navigability is first classified as the one using gsn pathways and the other using the real shortest path ( global optimum ) .",
    "suppose that the network is represented as a graph of @xmath6 vertices at coordinates @xmath7 that are connected by @xmath8 edges .",
    "assume an agent stands at a vertex @xmath9 and wants to travel to @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath11 be the vector between vertices @xmath9 and @xmath12 and @xmath13 be the angle between @xmath14 and @xmath15 . in case of spn",
    ", an agent simply follows the shortest path between @xmath9 and @xmath10 using the entire geometric and topological information .",
    "an agent of gsn , in contrast , moves to the neighbor @xmath12 of @xmath9 that has not been visited before and has the smallest @xmath13 .",
    "if all the neighbors of @xmath9 have been visited the navigator goes back to the vertex from which the navigator arrived to @xmath9 , which is in contrast to the simple greedy navigation based on the geometric proximity that sometimes fails to reach @xmath10 due to the lack of such a backtracking process  @xcite .",
    "this procedure is repeated until @xmath10 is reached .",
    "furthermore , we here distinguish the metrics based on the hopping distance ( the number of hops needed to reach the target ) and the euclidean distance ( the sum of euclidean distance along the path ) .",
    "note that the term `` euclidean distance '' usually refers to the distance between two points in a metric space regardless of their direct connection , but in this work we use this terminology as the sum of euclidean distance along the connected pathways , in a more flexible way .",
    "the former is appropriate for the situation when the time spent on the pathway is relatively insensitive to the length of each segment of pathways , or the waiting time for each junction ( vertex in this case ) is significant , e.g. , the airline network or express way network with significant delays in the junctions due to the traffic light . on the other hand , the latter is more suitable for the case when the junction does not play a significant role , e.g. , the road network without severe traffic and traffic light .",
    "such a distinction between vehicular and pedestrian patterns is responsible for important structural difference that we will discuss in details later .",
    "distinction between gsn and spn representing whether navigators only use the directional information or have the ability to fully access the real shortest path , combined with those two different metrics , yields four different navigation strategies in total .    at each time step @xmath10 ,",
    "the `` shortcut '' among the vertex pair ( not already connected by an edge in @xmath16 ) , which maximizes the performance of one of the four navigation strategies : greedy spatial navigation with hopping distance ( gsnh )  @xcite , greedy spatial navigation with euclidean distance ( gsne ) , shortest path navigation with hopping distance ( spnh ) , and shortest path navigation with euclidean distance ( spne ) , is selected .",
    "the shortcut is connected by a new edge , unless the candidate edge crosses one of the existing edges of @xmath16 in the 2d space  @xcite .",
    "this shortcut construction process is repeated as long as the total length @xmath17 of edges of @xmath16 does not exceed a length constraint @xmath18 . figure  [ boston_example ] illustrates the shortcut construction model based on the set of vertices in the major thoroughfares of boston road structure  @xcite .",
    "the constraint @xmath18 , in this case , is given by the total length of the original edges in fig .",
    "[ boston_example](a ) , and the performance is summarized in table  [ table1 ] . from fig .",
    "[ boston_example ] , we observe that the type of metric [ hopping distance for ( c ) and ( e ) vs.  euclidean distance for ( d ) and ( f ) ] greatly affects the final structure of the network .",
    ".total edge lengths and routing performances for the boston road example depicted in fig .",
    "[ boston_example ] .",
    "the total edge lengths and the gsn / sp distances are shown in an arbitrary unit . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     another geometric aspect of the optimized networks is seen by observing the distributions of area enclosed by edges and the angles by adjacent edges for vertices , i.e. , the angles between adjacent roads at the intersections .",
    "we observe that both the enclosed area distribution and angle distribution are notably distinguishable depending on the metrics used as shown in fig .",
    "[ enclosed_area_angle_dist ] . for hopping - distance based strategies , more heterogeneous enclosed area distributions compared to the euclidean - distance based strategies are observed ( fig .",
    "[ enclosed_area_angle_dist](a ) ) . in addition , very sharp angles ( fig .  [ enclosed_area_angle_dist](b ) ) are abundant due to the existence of hubs ( see fig .  [ random_example ] as well for examples ) , and the tendency is slightly more significant in spnh than gsnh . on the other hand ,",
    "the angles are distributed around @xmath19 , the characteristic angle of the regular triangle for euclidean - distance based gsne and spne .",
    "therefore , the enclosed area and angle distributions also indicate the emergence of relatively more regular triangular structures with uniform enclosed area for gsne and spne .",
    "so far , we have not allowed the crossing between edges in the construction process since we consider such a crossing as effectively generating a new junction or vertex .",
    "what if there is no such rule ?",
    "if we allow edge - crossing , star - graph - like structures are naturally emerged for spnh as shown in fig .",
    "[ x_random_example](c ) , which leads to the `` condensation '' in terms of degree , as the bimodal distribution for @xmath20 , and @xmath21 shown in fig .",
    "[ x_pk_gsnh_spnh](b )  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this severe condensation is not observed in case of gsnh , as shown in figs .",
    "[ x_random_example](a ) and [ x_pk_gsnh_spnh](a ) ( power - law - like fat tailed distribution but no condensation ) . the no - crossing rule , therefore , effectively prevents such a condensation for spnh , while no such explicit rule is necessary for gsnh , because the consideration of greedy navigators itself naturally avoid such condensed situations and allows the _ local _ hubs .",
    "the combinatorial effects of taking both hopping and euclidean distances are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite as well .",
    "finally , we remark that our simple model does not take into account the realistic number of connected roads for junctions ( degree in the notion of graphs ) , which is between @xmath22 and @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "considering such restrictions may make the model more realistic , but we would like to emphasize that our model can be very valid for much wider contexts , besides the street networks , without those explicit constraints .",
    "with a simple greedy optimization under the limited sum of length , we have investigated the various structural properties of optimized networks for different types of navigability . due to the complexity of finding the exact optimal configurations of transportation systems , in practice ,",
    "heuristic methods are usually adopted for real systems .",
    "therefore , we believe that even though our scheme is simple and idealistic , it has some degree of implications in real transportation systems .",
    "the most essential findings of ours are the emergence of hubs in case of the consideration of the hopping distance , inherently geometric aspect of optimized structures reflecting the types of metrics used , and the fact that the user - based routing scheme ( gsn ) effectively induces the local hubs even without the explicit no - crossing rule .",
    "the emergence of triangular blocks from the simple optimization procedure is also notable  would city plans be optimized for pedestrian navigability rather than traffic planning and building design , then we should probably see more triangular blocks . also , we would like to note that the triangular like pattern has always been found in the historical centers of cities built by a pedestrian strategy  @xcite .    more elaborated or realistic approaches , for instance , using the different types of backbones , stochastic edge additions ( similar to the simulated annealing process ) ; different objective functions such as the combination of navigability and length  @xcite or among different metrics , etc .",
    "are good candidates for the future work .",
    "the reality check using human subjects , of course , would be necessary for the application to the real systems .",
    "this rule is applied since we consider the road - like structure , where each vertex corresponds to the junctions of roads .",
    "therefore , a new crossing point generated by a new edge can be considered as a new vertex , which effectively changes the system size , so we intentionally avoid this situation .",
    "note that there are two slightly different kinds of clustering coefficients , i.e. , the one averaged over the individual vertices clustering coefficient which is used for @xmath24 in this work , and the other taking the ratio of numbers of triangles to the numbers of vertex triads used for @xmath25 ."
