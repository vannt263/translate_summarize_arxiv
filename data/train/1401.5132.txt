    "the bosonic channel plays a crucial role in classical and quantum information theory applied to optical communications .",
    "classical capacity of the bosonic channel is particularly important since it determines the ultimate performance limit of conventional optical communication technology .",
    "derivation of this ultimate limit , the holevo capacity , is a nontrivial theoretical problem on which much effort has been spent  @xcite .",
    "if the channel is lossless and noiseless , capacity can be attained by modulating photon number states and an ideal photon number counting receiver  @xcite . for a pure - loss channel , the capacity was found in  @xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the channel s power transmissivity , @xmath2 is the average input photon number per mode , and @xmath3 ( throughout the paper , we choose @xmath4 ) .",
    "it was also shown  @xcite that capacity can be attained by a coherent - state modulation , but the optimal receiver must use joint measurements over many channel uses , which are very hard to realize physically  @xcite . for lossy bosonic channel with additive thermal noise from the environment ,",
    "it was conjectured  @xcite that the capacity is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the average number of noise photons per mode .",
    "the above conjecture relied on an unproven minimum output entropy conjecture , which was recently proven  @xcite to be true , hence confirming that   indeed is the capacity of the lossy - noisy bosonic channel , and that it can be achieved using a coherent - state modulation .",
    "one of the practically important things to note is that the capacities @xmath7 , and @xmath8 can be achieved by encoding information in coherent states with a gaussian distribution , i.e. , one does not need to use nonclassical states such as entangled or squeezed states . unlike the simple transmitter , the receiver must use a decoding strategy that is highly non - classical . in the proof of achievability in the original hsw theorem  @xcite , they employed the _ square - root measurement _ ( srm ) over an infinite sequence of signal states ( codeword ) .",
    "this is in general a _ collective _ measurement which may include entangling operations between modulation symbols across channel uses and thus is a highly nonclassical operation .",
    "since there is a clear gap between the holevo capacity @xmath7 and the shannon capacities of conventional optical receivers  @xcite , i.e. , homodyne , heterodyne or direct - detection receivers , a natural question arises : how to design receiver measurements that can achieve a reliable communication rate beyond the shannon limits of conventional receivers using a receiver that is more practical than the srm , the mathematical specification of which unfortunately sheds no light on a structured receiver design ?",
    "this question has been explored theoretically  @xcite and experimentally @xcite , but a truly - realizable receiver specification that outperforms conventional optical receivers still eludes us .    in this paper , we restrict ourselves to receiver measurements consisting of a limited class of quantum operations , called gaussian operations , and allow any amount of classical feedback or feedforward ( ff ) within the receiver .",
    "this class of operations can be constructed by combining passive linear optics ( a network of beamsplitters and phase - shifters ) , second order nonlinear optical processes ( squeezers ) , along with homodyne and heterodyne detection measurements , all of which are now routinely implemented  @xcite . on the other hand , it has also been found that some of the important quantum protocols can not be performed with gaussian operations and classical processing alone .",
    "examples of those are universal quantum computing  @xcite , entanglement distillation of gaussian states  @xcite , optimal cloning of coherent states  @xcite , optimal discrimination of coherent states  @xcite , and gaussian quantum error correction  @xcite . here",
    "we ask the question whether the classical information transmission capacity for bosonic channels can benefit from a receiver that is restricted to gaussian quantum operations and ff .",
    "the main result of our paper is an addition to the long list of the above `` no - go theorems '' , i.e. , we show that gaussian operations and classical ff processing can not exceed the shannon limit of homodyne and heterodyne detection for the lossy - noisy bosonic channel with coherent state inputs .",
    "our result has a practical importance : to exceed the theoretical limit of the conventional coherent optical communication system via a collective quantum decoder , one has to incorporate non - gaussian operations in the receiver . as a byproduct of the analysis",
    ", we propose a hybrid receiver that time - shares between homodyne and heterodyne , which we show to slightly surpass the envelope of the homodyne and heterodyne capacities in a certain regime of average signal photon number per mode .",
    "finally we compare our gaussian receiver limit with experimentally feasible non - gaussian receivers based on photon counting detectors .",

    "this falls under the category of _ direct detection _ receivers ( unlike homodyne and heterodyne detection , which are collectively fall under _ coherent detection _",
    "receivers ) .",
    "direct detection receivers include the photon number resolving detector ( pnrd ) and the on - off single - photon detection ( spd ) receiver , where the latter can discriminate only between zero and non - zero photons .",
    "it has been shown theoretically that combining an ideal single - photon detector with the phase - space displacement operation ( implementable using a highly - transmissive beamsplitter and a strong coherent - state local oscillator ) , and potentially also classical feedback ( e.g. , subsequent single - photon detection events triggering real - time updates to the amplitude and phase of a local oscillator that in turn is mixed with , to coherently _ null _ , the received pulse before it is incident on the detector s active surface ) can beat the coherent - detection ( homodyne and heterodyne ) limit of discriminating two or more coherent states @xcite .",

    "these results on improved structured receivers for coherent state discrimination suggests that receivers based on photon counting could also be useful to go beyond the capacity limit of gaussian receivers .",
    "this is because the task of a communication receiver is essentially to discriminate between @xmath150 modulated codewords , each of which is a @xmath9-mode coherent - state waveform .        for optical communication system designers , a popular way to assess",
    "the performance of a transceiver is to plot the trade - off between spectral efficiency ( expressed in bits per symbol , or bits / sec / hz ) and the photon information efficiency ( expressed in bits per received photon ) , for a given modulation format and a receiving strategy . for instance , for a pure loss channel with @xmath151 mean received photon number per mode ( or per time slot ) , using an optimal code and a holevo - capacity - achieving receiver , the spectral efficiency ( se ) is @xmath152 bits / sec / hz and the photon information efficiency ( pie ) is @xmath153 bits / photon .",

    "[ fig : non - gaussian_receivers ] that there is a substantial gap between the attainable performance by known structured receivers ( all of which admit physical realizations via a symbol - by - symbol detection of the received modes ) and the holevo limit , even at moderate to high spectral efficiency .",

    "<S> laser - light ( coherent - state ) modulation is sufficient to achieve the ultimate ( holevo ) capacity of classical communication over a lossy and noisy optical channel , but requires a receiver that jointly detects long modulated codewords with highly nonlinear quantum operations , which are near - impossible to realize using current technology . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the capacity of the lossy - noisy optical channel when the transmitter uses coherent state modulation but the receiver is restricted to a general quantum - limited _ gaussian _ receiver , i.e. , one that may involve arbitrary combinations of gaussian operations ( passive linear optics : beamsplitters and phase - shifters , second order nonlinear optics ( or active linear optics ): squeezers , along with homodyne or heterodyne detection measurements ) and any amount of classical feedforward within the receiver . under these assumptions , we show that the gaussian receiver that attains the maximum mutual information is either homodyne detection , heterodyne detection , or time sharing between the two , depending upon the received power level . in other words </S>",
    "<S> , our result shows that to exceed the theoretical limit of conventional coherent optical communications , one has to incorporate non - gaussian , i.e. , third or higher - order nonlinear operations in the receiver . </S>",
    "<S> finally we compare our gaussian receiver limit with experimentally feasible non - gaussian receivers and show that in the regime of low received photon flux , it is possible to overcome the gaussian receiver limit by relatively simple non - gaussian receivers based on photon counting . </S>"
