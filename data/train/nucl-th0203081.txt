    "a variety of related models of the nucleon emff @xcite were fitted to the complete set of data available before september 2001 .",
    "one group of models included variants of the basic gk model of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 vector meson pole terms with hadronic form factors and a term with pqcd behavior which dominates at high @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "four varieties of hadronic form factor parameterization ( of which two are used in @xcite ) were compared .",
    "in addition to the gk type models we considered a group of models ( generically designated dr - gk ) that use the analytic approximation of @xcite to the dispersion integral approximation for the @xmath0 meson contribution ( similar to that of @xcite ) , modified by the four hadronic form factor choices used with the gk model , and the addition of the well established @xmath3 ( 1450 ) pole . every model had an electric and a magnetic coupling parameter for each of the three pole terms , four  cut - off \" masses for the hadronic form - factors and the qcd scale mass scale , @xmath11 for the logarithmic momentum transfer behavior in pqcd .",
    "in addition the effect of a normalization parameter was sometimes considered for the dispersion relation behavior of the @xmath0 meson in the dr - gk models .    when the set of parameters in each of the eight models was fitted to the full set of data available before publication , for @xmath6 , @xmath12 , @xmath7 , @xmath13 and the lower @xmath9 values of @xmath14 , three gk and all four dr - gk models attained reasonable @xmath15 ( when the inconsistency of some low @xmath9 @xmath7 and @xmath13 data was taken into account ) , but the extended dr - gk models had significantly lower @xmath15 .",
    "furthermore @xmath11 was reasonable for three of the dr - gk models but for only the one of the gk models that had an unreasonably large anomalous magnetic coupling @xmath16 .",
    "it was concluded that the three dr - gk models were the best nucleon emff to use in prediction of nuclear electromagnetic properties .",
    "all thee were found to be moderately consistent in their predictions up to @xmath9 of 8  gev@xmath10 .    however the part of the above data set from a recent @xmath4 ratio data @xcite for @xmath17  gev@xmath18  gev@xmath19 , swamped statistically by all the other data , was systematically lower than the fitted models ( fig.5 of @xcite ) contributing disproportionately to @xmath15 .",
    "this ratio is determined by an asymmetry measurement in the scattering of polarized electrons on protons .",
    "multiplied by the well determined values of @xmath12 one obtains values for @xmath6 which are not subject to the uncertainty inherent in the rosenbluth separation measurements in which @xmath6 is obtained by subtracting the much larger contribution of @xmath12 from the unpolarized cross section .",
    "as expected the @xmath6 derived from the measured @xmath4 are consistently below those of the older rosenbluth separation values .",
    "it is plausible to expect that the old @xmath6 data is responsible for restricting the best fit of the models to be substantially above the experimental @xmath4 values . with this in mind",
    "the particularly high data of @xcite was omitted from the fit to the model type dr - gk@xmath20(1 ) of @xcite and the flexibility of a @xmath0 meson dispersion integral normalization parameter n was included . in this article the original version",
    "is designated as gkex(01 ) and when fitted to the smaller data set as gkex(01- ) . as seen in tables  [ t1 ] and  [ t2 ] and figs .",
    "[ elfig1 ] and [ elfig2 ] , there is only a small change in the fit to @xmath6 and @xmath4 , although the parameters of the fit change substantially .",
    "@xmath21    @xmath22    after the publication of @xcite new data @xcite extended the measurements of @xmath4 up to @xmath23  gev@xmath10 , exacerbating the discrepancy with the predictions of the best models in @xcite .",
    "very recently @xmath24 has been obtained directly @xcite by the scattering of polarized electrons on deuterium and detecting the polarized recoil neutron at @xmath9 = 0.45 , 1.15 and 1.47  gev@xmath10 .",
    "the preliminary results are consistent with the galster @xcite parameterization from lower @xmath9 data @xmath25 which , in parallel to the situation for @xmath4 , implies much lower values of @xmath7 in their @xmath9 range when coupled with @xmath13 values ( either the precision data of @xcite or the model fits ) .    in this paper , in addition to the above comparison of gkex(01 ) and gkex(01- ) , we fit the model of type dr - gk@xmath20(1 ) , with the added isoscalar vector meson @xmath8(1419 ) pole , to the following data sets , chosen to determine the effect of the old @xmath7 and @xmath6 data in direct conflict with the values of @xmath5 and @xmath4 from modern polarization measurements :    1 .   the fit gkex(02l ) from the full data set of @xcite with the addition of @xcite and @xcite , the omission of @xcite ( as above for gkex(01- ) ) and the @xmath7 values for @xmath26  gev@xmath10 of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the fit of gkex(02s ) to the same data set as above except for the omission of the @xmath6 values for @xmath27  gev@xmath10 of @xcite .",
    "it will be seen that the omission of the conflicting @xmath7 data , gkex(02l ) , has a much bigger influence than the omission of @xcite , gkex(01- ) , enabling a much better fit to @xmath4 in addition to a very good fit to @xmath5 , compared to gkex(01 ) . with the removal of the conflicting @xmath6 data , gkex(02s ) ,",
    "the fit to all the remaining data , including @xmath4 , is very satisfactory .    in section  [ s:2 ]",
    "we will specify the models and parameters used in this article , and the data sets used in section  [ s:3 ] . in section  [ s:4 ] we present the results of the four gkex fits in comparison with each other .",
    "we extrapolate beyond the present experimental range of momentum transfer where necessary for predicting available deuteron emff data .",
    "the model gkex(02s ) fits the modern and consistent older data well and meets the requirements of dispersion relations and of qcd at low and high momentum transfer .",
    "conclusions are presented in section  [ s:5 ] .",
    "in fitting the nucleon emff data including the new @xmath5 and @xmath4 results we have chosen to use the extended gk model dr - gk@xmath20(1 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite with the addition of a pole term for the well established isoscalar vector meson @xmath8(1419 ) , whose mass is lower than that of the already included isovector vector meson @xmath3(1450 ) .",
    "we denote this model as gkex . the choice of the particular parameterization dr - gk@xmath20(1 )",
    "was made because of its low @xmath15 value and the fact that its predicted values of @xmath4 were a little closer to the data than those of the other extended models .",
    "in addition dr - gk@xmath20(1 ) has the following good physical properties :    1 .",
    "it uses the qcd cut - off @xmath28 for the helicity flip meson - nucleon form factors , rather than the meson cut - off @xmath29 used by dr - gk(3 ) and dr - gk@xmath20(3 ) .",
    "the evolution of the logarithmic dependence on @xmath9 is controlled by the quark - nucleon cut - off @xmath30 , along with @xmath11 .",

    "3 .   fitted to the data",
    "set of @xcite it finds @xmath11 = .1163 , close to the expected value .",
    "the form factors are not very sensitive to this parameter which is fixed at .15 for the fits to the new data sets .    so that the reader need not make constant reference to @xcite we repeat the relevant formulas here together with the new @xmath8(1419 ) terms .",
    "the emff of a nucleon are defined by the matrix elements of the electromagnetic current  @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the neutron , @xmath34 , or proton , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the square of the invariant momentum transfer . @xmath37 and @xmath38 are respectively the dirac and pauli form factors , normalized at @xmath39 as @xmath40 the sachs form factors , most directly obtained from experiment , are then @xmath41 expressed in terms of the isoscalar and isovector electromagnetic currents @xmath42    the gkex model has the following form for the four isotopic emff : @xmath43    where the pole terms are those of the @xmath0 , @xmath3 , @xmath1 , @xmath8 , and @xmath2 mesons , and the final term of each equation is determined by the asymptotic properties of pqcd .",

    "the form factor @xmath49 vanishes at @xmath50 , and it and @xmath51 decrease more rapidly at large @xmath9 than the other meson form factors .",
    "this conforms to the zweig rule imposed by the @xmath52 structure of the @xmath2 meson @xcite .",
    "this model has at most 14 free parameters :    1 .   8 couplings to the pole terms , the 4 @xmath53 and the 4 @xmath54 for the @xmath3 , @xmath1 , @xmath8 and @xmath2 mesons .",

    "is the addition of the higher q @xmath4 data points of @xcite and the @xmath5 data points of @xcite and the omission of the @xmath7 values for @xmath26  gev@xmath10 of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in the shorter data",

    "the relatively large value of @xmath28 , which controls the spin - flip suppression in qcd , is consistent with the slow approach to asymptopia observed in polarized hadron scattering .",
    "for the two cases in which @xmath66 is a fitted parameter , as well as the two for which it is fixed , it is consistent with high energy experiment .",
    "the addition of the @xmath8(1.419 ) meson in gkex(02l ) and gkex(02s ) has moved @xmath67 closer to the expected small negative value than all earlier fits , but there is still the implication of some effect from a higher mass isoscalar meson .",

    "the displacement of adjacent data points well beyond their error bars in this range is evident in the figures and contributes about 90 to the @xmath15 of @xmath13 .",

    "the figures show a slightly better fit to @xmath4 correlated with a very slightly worse fit to @xmath6 .",

    "the extrapolation is sensitive to the weight given to the polarized vs. the rosenbluth separation data in the fits .",

    "a measurement of the present quality at @xmath80  gev@xmath10 could distinguish between the two .",
    "the gkex model , consistent with vector meson dominance and perturbative qcd in the appropriate momentum transfer regions , represents well a consistent set of neutron and proton emff .",
    "this set includes polarization measurements , which are directly related to the ratios of electric to magnetic form factors , and differential cross section measurements of the magnetic form factors .",
    "the values of the electric form factors from the rosenbluth separation of the differential cross section is , in our final selection gkex(02s ) , only used for the lower range of @xmath9 where the magnetic contributions are less dominant . because of the physical properties of the model and the good quality of the fit we expect that the model predictions are sufficiently accurate to be used for predictions of the electromagnetic properties of nuclei .",
    "the model values may also be useful in planning future experiments .",
    "the above conclusions are only valid to the extent that adequate physics is included in the gkex models .",
    "only the @xmath0 meson exchange includes the width of the vector mesons ( from dispersion relation results ) .",
    "there will be corrections from the widths of the other exchanged vector mesons .",
    "however the next most important , the @xmath1 and @xmath2 , have very narrow widths .",
    "the higher masses of the @xmath3 ( 1450 ) and the @xmath8 ( 1420 ) reduces the importance of their substantial widths because of their distance from the physical region and their partial replacement by the pqcd term .    in assuming vector dominance we have neglected the multi - meson exchange continuum contributions . in particular the two - pion continuum may have an influence at very low @xmath81  gev@xmath10 .",
    "indeed , as remarked in@xcite and can be seen in fig .",
    "5b , the @xmath6 data of @xcite has a more negative slope for @xmath82  gev@xmath10 than the higher @xmath9 data and the model fit .",
    "the addition of a 2-pion exhange term to the model may enable a change of slope between the two regions , but would have little effect on the model fit for @xmath83  gev@xmath10 .",
    "one may also want to consider some higher mass vector mesons .",
    "this would have some importance in the fits of @xcite and@xcite , but are much less important in these gk type models because of the transition to pqcd behavior .",

    "<S> the gari - krmpelmann ( gk ) models of nucleon electromagnetic form factors , in which the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 vector meson pole contributions evolve at high momentum transfer to conform to the predictions of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) , was recently extended to include the width of the @xmath0 meson by substituting the result of dispersion relations for the pole and the addition of the @xmath3 ( 1450 ) isovector vector meson pole . </S>",
    "<S> this extended model was shown to produce a good overall fit to all the available nucleon electromagnetic form factor ( emff ) data . </S>",
    "<S> since then new polarization data shows that the electric to magnetic ratios @xmath4 and @xmath5 obtained are not consistent with the older @xmath6 and @xmath7 data in their range of momentum transfer . the model is further extended to include the @xmath8 ( 1419 ) isoscalar vector meson pole . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that while this gkex can not simultaneously fit the new @xmath4 and the old @xmath7 data , it can fit the new @xmath4 and @xmath5 well simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> an excellent fit to all the remaining data is obtained when the inconsistent @xmath6 and @xmath7 is omitted . </S>",
    "<S> the model predictions are extended beyond the data , if needed , to momentum transfer squared , @xmath9 , of 8 gev@xmath10 . </S>"
