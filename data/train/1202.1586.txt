    "earthquakes are the result of sudden release of huge amount of energy in the earth s crust that produces seismic waves .",
    "a sudden forthcoming of the seismic waves with large amplitudes and low frequencies have been great hazards to life and property .",
    "it is the collapse of bridges , dams , power plants , and other structures that causes extensive damage and loss of life during earthquakes .",
    "aseismic capabilities are highly relevant to public safety and a large amount of research has gone into establishing practical analysis and design methods for them .",
    "numerous earthquakeproof engineering methods have been tried to resist earthquakes , but still we are not so safe .",
    "seismic waves are a kind of inhomogeneous acoustic wave with various wavelengths .",
    "there are two types of seismic waves : body waves and surface waves .",
    "p(primary ) and s(secondary ) waves are the body waves and r(rayleigh ) and l(love ) waves are the surface waves .",
    "surface waves travel slower than body waves and the amplitudes decrease exponentially with the depth .",
    "it travels about @xmath0 with lots of variety within the depth of a wavelength @xcite .",
    "the wavelengths are in the order of @xmath1 and the frequencies are about @xmath2 , that is , low end and just below the audible frequency .",
    "however , they decay slower than body waves and are most destructive because of their low frequency , long duration , and large amplitude .",
    "rayleigh waves can exist only in an homogeneous medium with a boundary and have transverse motion.@xcite earthquake motions observed at the ground surface are mainly due to r waves . on the other hand ,",
    "l waves are polarized shear waves guided by an elastic layer .",
    "it is this that causes horizontal shifting of the earth during earthquakes .",
    "l waves have both longitudinal and transverse motion and this is what most people feel directly during earthquakes",
    ".    recent development of metamaterial science opens a new direction to control the seismic waves .",
    "farhat et al .",
    "proposed a design of a cloak to control bending waves propagated in isotropic heterogeneous thin plates @xcite .",
    "their cloaking of shear elastic waves pass smoothly into the material rather than reflecting or scattering at the material s surface .",
    "however , the cloaked seismic waves are still destructive to the buildings behind the cloaked region .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a method to control seismic waves by using a new class of materials called metamaterials .",
    "metamaterials are artificially engineered materials which has a special property of negative refractive index .",
    "we present here a solution that a metamaterial acts as an attenuator by converting the destructive seismic wave into an evanescent wave by making use of the imaginary velocity of stop - band of the wave .",
    "there are many representations to express the scale of earthquakes . among them",
    "the magnitude that comes from the amplitude of the seismic waves is most important .",
    "the common form of the magnitude , @xmath3 , is the _ richter - scale _ defined by comparing the two amplitudes in a logarithmic scale as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the maximum amplitude of the seismic wave and @xmath6 is the maximum amplitude of the background vibration and order of @xmath7 .",
    "the equipment measures a transformed magnitude of the intensity .",
    "another factor of the strength is pga(peak ground acceleration ) but it is not expressed in a closed form .",
    "we focus here on how to reduce the amplitude of the seismic wave by using the properties of the metamaterials .",
    "acoustic waves are created by compressibility or elasticity of the medium .",
    "young s modulus , @xmath8 , is a one - dimensional compressibility defined by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the pressure or stress and @xmath11 is the length .",
    "shear modulus , @xmath12 , is a two - dimensional one for a surface wave defined by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the horizontal shift and @xmath15 is the height of the object .",
    "bulk modulus , @xmath16 , is a three - dimensional one for a body wave defined by @xmath17 .",
    "seismic medium of earth crust can be considered as an accumulation of infinite number of elastic plates .",
    "although the seismic surface wave is not pure two dimensional , the velocity is mainly dependent upon the density , @xmath18 , and shear modulus , @xmath12 , of the seismic medium .",
    "seismic wave is a kind of acoustic wave and every acoustic wave propagates following two wave equations in principle .",
    "assuming the plane wave time dependence @xmath19 , the pressure , @xmath20 , and the velocity , @xmath21 of the wave in the two dimensions are expressed as the newton s 2nd law @xmath22 and the continuity equation @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the laplacian operator at the surface , @xmath20 is the pressure , @xmath25 is the anguar frequency of the wave , and @xmath21 is the velocity .    the eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) generates the wave equation as @xmath26 where the velocity of the seismic wave is @xmath27 if the shear modulus becomes negative , the velocity becomes imaginary .",
    "then , so does the refractive index , @xmath28 , or the inverse of the velocity as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the background velocity .",
    "since @xmath31 , the wavevector becomes imaginary , too .",
    "therefore , the imaginary wavevector makes the amplitude of the seismic wave become an evanescent wave .",
    "we call it a barrier or attenuator .",
    "note that the impedance @xmath32 becomes imaginary because it is an absorption .",
    "negative shear modulus of elastic media has been studied and realized very recently @xcite .",
    "the key was the helmholtz resonators similarly with the negative bulk modulus .",
    "the resonance of accumulated waves in the helmholtz resonator reacts against the applied pressure at some specific frequency ranges .",
    "then , the negative modulus is realized by passing the acoustic wave through an array of helmholtz resonators",
    ". therefore , the sound intensity decays exponentially at some resonant frequency ranges . in general the elastic material",
    "is described by three independent effective parameters of @xmath12 , @xmath16 , and @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , sometimes the @xmath12 is replaced by a linear combination of @xmath12 , @xmath16 , and the lam@xmath33 constant @xcite , but it will not change the structure of the theory .",
    "acoustic waves from the modulus share fundamental properties of sound waves .    from the formalism of electromagnetic response in metamaterials , effective electric permittivity and effective",
    "magnetic permeability show negative values at some specific frequency ranges around resonances @xcite .",
    "the helmholtz resonator is a realization of an electrical resonance circuit by mechanical correspondence .",
    "it is known as that the plasmon frequency in metals or in an array of metal wires produces the electric permittivity as @xcite @xmath34 ,   \\label{13}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the plasma frequency and @xmath36 is a loss by damping .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) is the counterpart of the faraday s law and eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) is of the ampere s law by the analogy of electromagnetism and mechanics .",
    "the inverse of the modulus in mechanical system corresponds to the electric permittivity in electromagnetic system . considering the structural loss , the general form of the effective shear modulus , @xmath37 ,",
    "is given similarly with the general form of the bulk modulus as @xcite @xmath38 ,   \\label{15}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the resonance frequency and @xmath40 is a geometric factor @xcite .",
    "the real and imaginary part of the @xmath37 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] at specific values of @xmath40 and @xmath36 .",
    "the real part can be negative at resonance and slightly increased frequency ranges .",
    "the negative range of the real part is the stop - band of the wave .",
    "when the imaginary part , the loss , is small compared with real part , the effective shear modulus has negative value at @xmath41 .",
    "we can built an attenuator or an earthquakeproof barrier of a seismic wave by filling - up many resonators under the ground around the building that we want to protect .",
    "then , the amplitude of the seismic wave that passed the waveguide is reduced exponentially by the imaginary wavevector at the frequency ranges of negative modulus .",
    "mixing up many different kinds of resonators will cover many different corresponding frequency ranges of the seismic waves .",
    "if we assume that the plain seismic wave of wavelength @xmath42 propagates in @xmath43direction , the amplitude of the wave reduces exponentially as @xmath44 let the initial seismic wave , that is , before entering the waveguide , have amplitude @xmath45 and magnitude @xmath46 , and final seismic wave , that is after leaving the waveguide , have amplitude @xmath47 and magnitude @xmath48 following the eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "then , @xmath47 is written as @xmath45 from eq .",
    "( [ 20 ] ) as @xmath49 the amplitude of the seismic wave reduces exponentially as passing the waveguide of metamaterials .",
    "we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ 25 ] ) with the definition of the magnitude in eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) as @xmath50 taking logarithms both sides of eq . ( [ 30 ] ) , we obtain the width of the waveguide , @xmath51 , as @xmath52 where @xmath53 .    for example , if the refractive index is @xmath54 and the wavelength of the surface wave is @xmath55 , we need the waveguide of the width @xmath56 to reduce @xmath57 .",
    "if the aseismic level of the building is @xmath58 and the width of the waveguide surrounding the building is about @xmath59 then the effective aseismic level of the building is increased to @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , a high refractive index material is desirable for a narrow waveguide . in civil engineering earthquakeproofing methods",
    "must be practical , that is , clear to manufacture and easy to construct .",
    "the resonator should be easy to build .",
    "we designed an example of a resonator in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "the size of the cylinder can be estimated from the analogy between electric circuits and mechanical pipes .",
    "a pipe or tube with open ends corresponds to an inductor , and a closed end corresponds to a capacitor @xcite .",
    "@xmath61 where @xmath18 is the density inside the volume , @xmath62 is the effective length , @xmath63 is the area of the cross - section , @xmath64 is the volume , and @xmath65 is the velocity inside . from eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) the resonant frequency is given as @xmath66 in the meta - cylinder @xmath62 is the effective length which is given by @xmath67 @xcite , where @xmath11 is the length of the hole or thickness of the cylinder , and @xmath68 is the diameter of the hole .",
    "an example of the design of the meta - cylinder for the seismic frequency range is followings : the diameter of the hole is order of @xmath69 , the thickness of the cylinder is order of @xmath69 , and the volume inside is order of @xmath70 . since the meta - cylinder is considerably smaller than the corresponding wavelengthes , the array meta - cylinders behaves as a homogenized medium .",
    "the shape of the meta - cylinder is neither necessary to be circular nor to have 4 holes .",
    "it could be any form of a concrete box with several side holes .",
    "cubic or hexagonal boxes would be fine .",
    "various kinds of resonators may cover various kinds of resonance frequencies of the seismic waves .",
    "there happens an energy dissipation of the seismic waves inside of the waveguide and the absorbed energy will turn into sound and heat .",
    "they makes the temperature of the waveguide increasing depending on the magnitude of energy that arrives at the waveguide .",
    "a vertical view of the metamaterial barrier with many meta - cylinders are in fig .",
    "the width of the barrier , @xmath14 , is predicted in eq .",
    ". the depth of the waveguide should be at least the foundation work of the building to protect as in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , but it is not necessary to be more than the wavelength of the surface waves . the completed form of the waveguide is the aseismic cylindrical shell of many concentric rings in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .",
    "seismic waves can not pass through water .",
    "then , we can imagine a water barrier of a big trench filled with water .",
    "however , it is not stable to stand a series of attacks of ` foreshock @xmath71 main shock @xmath71 aftershock . '",
    "because , if the outer part of the water trench is brought down by a seismic wave , we do not have enough time to rebuild it to prepare for the main shock and the after shock .",
    "water can not have a high refractive index @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ 35 ] ) , too . maintaining the depth of the water trench up to the wavelength of the seismic wave",
    "require huge amount of water and , therefore , not be practical .",
    "we introduced a supportive method for aseismic design . it is not to add another aseismic system to a building but to construct an earthquakeproof barrier around the building to be protected .",
    "this barrier is a kind of waveguide that reduces exponentially the amplitude of the dangerous seismic waves .    controlling the width and refractive index of the waveguide",
    ", we can upgrade the aseismic range of the building as needed in order to defend it , at will , without touching it .",
    "it could be a big advantage of the waveguide method .",
    "this method will be effective for isolated buildings because we need some areas to construct the aseismic shell .",
    "it may be applicable for social overhead capitals such as power plants , dams , airports , nuclear reactors , oil refining complexes , long - span bridges , express rail - roads , etc .",
