    "nowadays , countless and precise cosmological observations , type ia supernova ( snia ) @xcite , the 9th year data of the wmap mission @xcite , the cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite and the large scale structure ( lss ) @xcite , confirm that our universe is currently undergoing a phase of accelerated expansion .",
    "the provenance of acceleration may be caused due to an un - known energy component with negative pressure , called _ dark energy _ ( de ) . according to cautious analysis of cosmological observations , about @xmath7 of the total energy content of the universe",
    "has been occupied by de , around @xmath8 pressureless dark matter ( dm ) , and around @xmath9 of total energy content is denoted to the normal baryonic matter .",
    "however , at the present , the radiation part can be ignored in comparison to other components . despite of mysterious nature of de , during the past decades , many candidates have been nominated in order to describe de . see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the first and simplest candidate of dark energy is the cosmological constant @xmath10 , with a constant equation of state ( eos ) parameter @xmath11 .",
    "although this model is consistent very well with all observations , it suffers the cosmic coincidence problem .",
    "the solution of the cosmic coincidence problem requires that our universe behaves in such a way that the ratio of dm to de densities must be a constant of order unity or varies more slowly than the scale factor and finally reaches to a constant of order unity @xcite . in order to solve this problem ,",
    "the dynamical de models have been proposed .",
    "some analysis on the ` snia ' observational data reveals that the time varying de model gives a better fit compare with a cosmological constant @xcite .    among of many dynamical de models ,",
    "the so called hde model , based on holographic principle proposed by t hooft @xcite and susskind @xcite , has attracted a lot of attention . according to the holographic principle",
    ", the number of degrees of freedom of a physical system scales with its area instead of its volume .",
    "the development of holographic principle for our purpose was put forwarded by cohen et al .",
    "@xcite specify an infrared cutoff length scale and then by hsu @xcite and li @xcite , who applied hde model for solving the de puzzle . in this model",
    "the energy density is written by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is proportional to the area which provides an ir - cutoff , @xmath14 is the planck mass and the numerical constant @xmath15 is introduced for convenience and utility @xcite . at following , we would work in the framework of _  natural unit _",
    ", where ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the ir - cutoff @xmath17 plays an essential role in hde model .",
    "if @xmath18 is chosen as particle horizon , the hde can not produce an acceleration expansion @xcite , while for future event horizon , hubble scale @xmath19 , and apparent horizon ( ah ) , as an ir - cutoff , the hde can simultaneously drive accelerated expansion and solve the coincidence problem pavon1,zpavon0606555,sheykhi1 .",
    "thereupon , gao et al .",
    "@xcite recommended that the hde density may inversely be proportional to the ricci scalar curvature . succeeding this ,",
    "feng @xcite studied this model in the framework of bd cosmology . afterward on granda - oliveros @xcite proposition , a new cutoff based on wholly dimensional basis , which adds a term including the first derivation of the hubble parameter , was introduced .",
    "this cutoff looked alike the ricci scalar of the frw metric but with two free parameters , @xmath20 , where @xmath21  and @xmath22  are constant parameters of order unity .",
    "this model depends on local quantities , avoiding in this way the causality problem that is exist in the holographic dark energy based on the event horizon @xcite . despite of some success in corresponding with other de models like scalar field @xcite ,",
    "chaplygin gas @xcite and study of cosmological evolution @xcite and obtaining the cosmological constrain on this model @xcite , this form of cutoff unable to fit the most recent growth data on structure formation in the ordinary einstein general relativity frame work @xcite .",
    "for the reason that the hde density belongs to a dynamical cosmological constant , we need a dynamical framework to accommodate it instead of einstein gravity .",
    "the best choice for this , is bd theory which is the scalar tensor theory and was invented first by jordan @xcite and then ripened by brans and dicke @xcite .",
    "this theory is based on mach s principle , which is a fundamental principle to explain the origin of inertia . in attempting to incorporate mach s principle",
    ", the bd theory introduces a time dependent inertial scalar field @xmath23 , which plays the role of the gravitational constant @xmath24 , so that @xmath25 and is determined by the matter field distributions .",
    "so the gravitational fields are described by the metric @xmath26 and the bd scalar field @xmath27 , which has the dimension @xmath28=[m]^{2}$ ] . in bd theory , the scalar field @xmath23 couples to gravity via a coupling parameter @xmath29 and it has been generalized for various scalar tensor theories .",
    "therefore , the investigation on the holographic models of de in the framework of bd theory , has of great interest and have been accomplished in @xcite .",
    "the combination of bd field and hde can accommodate @xmath30 crossing for the eos parameter of non - interacting hde @xcite .",
    "it was shown that in bd cosmology when an interaction between de and dm is taken into account , the transition from normal state @xmath31 to the phantom regime @xmath32 can be more easily accounted compared to the einstein gravity .",
    "also , in @xcite , it has been demonstrated that the accelerated expansion will not be achieved in bd theory without interactions , when the hubble horizon is taken as the ir cut - off .",
    "howbeit , when the event horizon takes the role of ir cut - off , an accelerating universe is obtained .",
    "furthermore , the phantom crossing is more easily achieved when the matter and the hde undergo an exotic interaction jamilkarami2011 .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the hde in bd cosmology using a go as ir - cutoff .",
    "we assume the bd field as a power law of the scale factor , @xmath33 , and as it has mentioned in jamilkarami2011,bp2007 that there is no compelling reason for this choice .",
    "however it has been shown that for small @xmath34 it leads to consistent result . usually in papers which investigate the de in the bd cosmology with different ir - cutoff feng2008,bp2007,zpavon0606555,jamilkarami2011",
    ", authors assume that matter evolves as @xmath35  or some other assumptions like this for @xmath36  and by use of this , they calculated the eos parameter of de .",
    "this assumption had been also considered in interacting case , which has been given more complicated or sometimes wrong relations for cosmological quantities .",
    "in fact by considering interaction between de - dm , energy conservation is not valid separately for each component .",
    "here we are attempting to provide a more generic way , without any restricted supposition , to calculate the eos parameter and some other cosmological parameters of our interest .",
    "it must be noted that , although , there is not any evidence for existence any direct interaction between dm and de , no known symmetries prevent such interaction . on the other hands ,",
    "such a choice for interacting term do nt make any discordance with observation as mentioned in ref .",
    "in addition , the latest cosmological constraints on the coupled de models , in which the quintessence scalar field non - minimally couples to the cold dm , from the recent planck measurements has been done @xcite .    the last main task that must be investigated is the stability analysis of model by calculating the squared of sound speed ( @xmath37 ) peebleratra .",
    "the analysis of squared of sound speed could say us about the perturbation growth and the structure formation at present .",
    "however this quantity does not enough insight to say the model is surely stable , but at least can show sounds of instability of the model .",
    "the sign of @xmath3 plays a crucial role in determining the instability of the background evolution .",
    "if @xmath38 , it means that we have the classical instability of a given perturbation .",
    "in contrast @xmath39 , leaves chance for greeting a stable universe against perturbations .",
    "this paper is outlined as follows . in section [ bd ] , a brief review of the hde in bd cosmology",
    "is given . in section",

    "the equation of motion for bd scalar field is given by @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is trace of energy momentum tensor @xmath54 .",
    "since the dm is pressureless , thus the total pressure equals the de pressure , @xmath55 .",
    "we further assume that both components do not conserve separately but interact with each other in such a manner that the continuity equations take the form @xmath56 @xmath57 where @xmath58 , denotes the eos of de , and @xmath59 stands for the interaction term .",
    "it should be noted that the ideal interaction term must be motivated from the theory of quantum gravity . in the absence of such a theory , we rely on pure dimensional basis for choosing an interaction @xmath59 .",
    "it is worth noting that the continuity equations imply that the interaction term should be a function of a quantity with units of inverse of time ( a first and natural choice can be the hubble factor @xmath60 ) multiplied with the energy density .",
    "therefore , the interaction term could be in any of the following forms : ( i ) @xmath61 , ( ii ) @xmath62 , or ( iii ) @xmath63 .",
