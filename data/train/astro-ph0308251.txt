    "interstellar grains can absorb and scatter x - rays . the scattering , typically through small angles , results in a `` halo '' of scattered x - rays within @xmath0 of an x - ray source ( overbeck 1965 ; hayakawa 1970 ; martin 1970 ) .",
    "the observed properties of these x - ray halos provide a test of interstellar grain models .",
    "the nature of interstellar grains remains uncertain ( see draine 2003a , and references therein ) .",
    "this paper will examine x - ray scattering and absorption for a grain model consisting of two separate grain populations  carbonaceous grains and silicate grains . with the grains approximated by homogeneous spheres with the size distribution found by weingartner & draine ( 2001 ; hereafter wd01 ) , this grain model is consistent with the observed interstellar extinction law , the observed infrared emission from interstellar dust ( li & draine 2001 , 2002 ) , and the x - ray scattering halo observed around nova cygni 1992 ( draine & tan 2003 ) .",
    "the carbonaceous grains are assumed to be graphitic when the grains are large , extending down to very small sizes with the smallest grains being individual polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules .",
    "the scattering is dominated by grains with radii @xmath1 , containing @xmath2 atoms ; carbonaceous grains in this size range are modelled using the optical properties of graphite .",

    "the paper has three relatively independent parts , and readers may wish to proceed directly to the material of interest to them .    the first part of this paper   [ sec : dielec ]  is concerned with the dielectric functions of graphite and mgfesio@xmath3 from infrared to x - ray energies .",
    "the resulting dielectric functions satisfy the kramers - kronig relations as well as the oscillator strength sum rule .    the second part of the paper    [ sec : xrayxsections][sec : halos ]  examines the x - ray scattering properties of interstellar dust , including structure near x - ray absorption edges .",
    "the angular distribution of the scattered x - rays is discussed : the median scattering angle @xmath4 is found as a function of energy , and a simple analytic approximation to the differential scattering cross section is presented . in  [ sec : halos ] we provide analytic approximations for the intensity distribution in x - ray scattering halos for simple dust density distributions .",
    "the final part of the paper ,  [ sec : xrayobs ] , discusses observations of x - ray scattering halos , and values of total scattering cross section derived from these observations .",
    "we conclude that the observational situation is unclear at this time , due to the combined effects of instrumental limitations and uncertainties in the spatial distribution of the dust , but the silicate / carbonaceous grain model appears to be consistent with the overall body of observational data .",
