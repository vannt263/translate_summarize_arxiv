    "from the gene regulatory networks that control organismal development  @xcite and the coherent oscillations between brain regions responsible for cognition  @xcite to the connected technologies that support critical infrastructure  @xcite , systems at many scales of modern society rely on the coordination of the dynamics of interdependent systems . analyzing the mechanisms driving such complex networks presents serious challenges to dynamical systems , statistical mechanics , and control theory , including but not limited to the overtly high dimension of their state spaces .",
    "this precludes directly identifying and visualizing their attractors and attractor - basin organization .",
    "moreover , without knowledge of the latter large - scale architecture , predicting network behavior , let alone developing control strategies to maintain function or mitigate failure , is impossible .    to shed light on these challenges , we explore limit - cycle attractors arising when rings of coupled nonlinear oscillators synchronize .",
    "we demonstrate how synchronization emerges and stabilizes and identify the diversity of synchronized states .",
    "we probe the global attractor - basin architecture by driving the networks with noise , capturing how the distinct synchronized states can be reached from each other via what we call attractor switching networks .",
    "the analysis relies on the use of limit - cycle attractors to define coarse - grained units of system state space .    in this way",
    ", our study of attractor - basin architecture falls in line with the methods of qualitative dynamics introduced by poincare  @xcite .",
    "confronted with unsolvable nonlinear dynamics in the three - body problem , poincare showed that system behaviors are guided and constrained by invariant state space structures ",
    "fixed point , limit cycle , and chaotic attractors  and their arrangement in state space  basins of attraction and their separatrices .",
    "the power of his qualitative approach came in providing a concise description of all possible behaviors of a system , without requiring detailed system solutions .",
    "his architectural approach is more recently expressed in terms of smale basic sets  @xcite and conley s index theory  @xcite .",
    "these show that any system decomposes into recurrent and wandering subspaces in which the behavior is a gradient flow . in short",
    ", there is a kind of lyapunov function over the entire state space , underlying the architectural view of attractors and their basins .",
    "this view is so basic to our modern understanding of nonlinear complex systems that it has been rechristened as the `` fundamental theorem of dynamical systems ''  @xcite .",
    "as we will see , our analytical study of oscillator arrays appeals to lyapunov functions to locally analyze limit cycle stability and noise robustness , while our numerical explorations allow us to knit together the stable attractors into a network of stable oscillations , connected by particular pathways that facilitate switching between them .",
    "practically , complicated attractor - connectivity architectures can be probed via external controls or added noise .",
    "we focus on the latter here , following recent successful explorations of noise - driven large - scale systems .",
    "for example , the analysis of bistable gene transcription networks showed that attractor switches can be induced by periodic pulses of noise  @xcite .",
    "another recent study of networks of pulse - coupled oscillators showed that unstable attractors become prevalent with increasing network size and the attractors are closely approached by basin tendrils of other attractors .",
    "thus , arbitrarily small noise can lead to switching between attractors  @xcite .",
    "our explorations illustrate the theoretical foundations and complements the newer works by focusing on the dynamics of synchronization .",
    "synchronization between oscillators is itself an important and widely studied collective behavior of coupled systems  @xcite , with examples ranging from neural networks  @xcite to power grids  @xcite , clapping audiences  @xcite , and fireflies flashing in unison  @xcite .",
    "although different in scope and nature , all of these examples can be modeled as coupled oscillators .",
    "decades of research has revealed that a system of coupled oscillators may produce a rich variety of behaviors ; in addition to full synchronization , more complex patterns may emerge , including chaos  @xcite , chimera states  @xcite , and cluster synchronization  @xcite . here",
    ", we study rings of oscillators  a system that exhibits multiple stable synchronized patterns called rotating waves  @xcite . rings of oscillators have been extensively studied  @xcite ; our contribution in this respect focuses on _ reactively _ coupled amplitude - phase oscillators and the organization of their attractors , basins , and noise - driven basin transitions .     reactive coupling , in the context of electromechanical oscillators , is that which does not dissipate energy , such as ideal elastic and electrostatic interactions between devices@xcite . a primary motivation of this work is to connect with experiment , using reactive coupling to characterize systems of nearest - neighbor coupled rings of nanoscale piezoelectric oscillators  @xcite .",
    "recent experiments investigated synchronous behavior of two such nanoelectromechanical systems ( nems )  @xcite , and it is expected that in the near future larger rings and more complex arrangements will be realized .",
    "@xcite in the context of the complex values used to model these oscillators , reactive coupling means that the coefficient of the laplacian coupling terms is purely imaginary .",
    "this coupling is captured , between landau - stuart oscillators , as a special case of the complex ginzburg - landau equation , which describes a wide range of physical phenomena  @xcite .",
    "if no noise is present , the system settles at one of its stable steady states .",
    "exactly which stable state depends on initial conditions . in the presence of noise ,",
    "the long - term behavior of the system is no longer characterized by deterministic attractors .",
    "depending on the level of noise three possible scenarios may emerge : ( i )  if the noise is small , the system fluctuates around an attractor ; ( ii )  if the noise is strong , the system is randomly pushed around in the state space suppressing the deterministic dynamics ; and ( iii )  intermediate levels of noise cause the system to fluctuate around an attractor and occasionally jump to the basin of attraction of a different attractor .",
    "the latter scenario suggests a coarse - grained description of the system s global organization : we specify the effective `` macrostate '' of the system by the attractor it fluctuates around , and we map out the likelihood of transitions to other attractors .",
    "these transitions form an attractor switching network ( asn ) capturing the coarse - grained dynamics of the system .",
    "noise and external perturbation induced jumps in the asn have been suggested as a feasible strategy to control large - scale nonlinear systems  @xcite .",
    "our goal is to study the fluctuations of the system and attractor switching in the presence of additive uncorrelated gaussian noise in the phases of oscillators .",

    "the fourth term expresses the inter - oscillator feedback : the oscillators are diffusively coupled to their nearest neighbors with purely imaginary coefficient .",

    "( [ eq : envelope ] ) presents a compact representation of the dynamics , it is in this case more insightful , and useful , to isolate the amplitude and phase components of the representative complex state .",

    "this frequency , proportional to the square of the oscillator s amplitude , comes from the device s nonlinear restoring force  the duffing nonlinearity .",

    "this example demonstrates that dynamical coarse - graining of the state space is an informative and necessary approach when constructing attractor switching networks for systems with noisy dynamics .",
    "moreover , asns provide an insightful description of the complex and high - dimensional dynamics of noisy , multistable systems .",
    "our long - term goal is to understand the architecture of basins of attraction in large - scale complex dynamical systems and to develop methods that reveal how state - space structures can facilitate driving between basins .",
    "here , we took several key steps toward these larger goals by analyzing in - depth synchronization phenomena in a system of coupled oscillators arranged in a ring topology . from the equations governing the evolution of the system ,",
    "we first predict analytically the different patterns of synchronization that can exist ( i.e. , rotating wave solutions ) and analyze their local stability via the linearization of the governing equations .",
    "we then analyze the covariance matrix of deviations around the attracting rotating waves and use this to construct a piecewise quadratic quasi - potential roughly describing the full attractor space .",
    "we additionally use this covariance matrix to make predictions about the fluctuations of phase differences .",
    "although the covariance analysis allows us to analytically calculate a metric for the robustness of each attractor to noise , we turn to simulation to deal with the impact of large noise . with this",
    ", we can explore the mechanisms associated with attractor switching and develop the attractor switching network .",
    "doing so reveals a clear and strong drive towards those rotating waves with wavenumber approximately half the number of nodes , such that adjacent oscillators are nearly out of phase .",
    "the techniques developed here should generalize to other systems and provide an systematic and analytic advance for developing the underlying theory of attractor switching networks .",
    "we intend to further this study by carefully investigating the dynamics of single switches in larger rings , extending our methods to complex networks with richer attractor types , and validating them in nems nanoscale device experiments .",
