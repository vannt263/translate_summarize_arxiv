    "the original articles concerned with the construction and mathematical analysis of discontinuous galerkin ( dg ) methods date back over 50 years ago . for hyperbolic partial differential equations , in 1973 reed & hill , cf .",
    "@xcite , developed the first dg discretization of the neutron transport equation .",
    "independently , dg methods were constructed for elliptic problems based on weakly enforcing dirichlet boundary conditions ; see , for example , @xcite . in particular , we highlight the works of nitsche @xcite and baker @xcite , which form the basis of the class of interior penalty dg methods , cf .",
    "also @xcite .",
    "since the very early work , dg methods were partially abandoned , in part due to the increase in the number of degrees of freedom compared , for instance , with their conforming counterparts . however , in the last two decades there has been a renewed interest in the field of discontinuous discretizations both from a theoretical and computational viewpoint , cf .",
    "@xcite , for example .",
    "this resurgence is due to the inherent advantages offered by dg schemes , such as , for example , the limited interelement communication , which is restricted only to neighbouring elements , the local conservativity property , the simplicity in treating meshes with hanging nodes , and the development of efficient @xmath0-adaptivity refinement strategies .",
    "moreover , recently in @xcite it has been shown that the underlying dg polynomial bases may be efficiently constructed in the physical frame , without needing to map local polynomial spaces defined in a given reference / canonical frame . in this way",
    ", dg methods can easily deal with general - shaped elements , including polygonal / polyhedral elements , cf .",
    "the flexibility of dg methods in handling general meshes has no immediate counterpart in the conforming framework , where the design of suitable finite element spaces for meshes of polygons / polyhedra is far from being a trivial task .",
    "several examples include the composite finite element method @xcite , the polygonal finite element method @xcite , the extended finite element method @xcite , and the most recent virtual element method @xcite .    at present",
    ", the design of solvers and preconditioners for dg discretizations on nonstandard grids lends itself to huge developments in the field of numerical analysis . indeed , to the best of our knowledge , the only study regarding solution techniques for this class of problems is reported in @xcite , where a nonoverlapping schwarz preconditioner for composite dg finite element methods on complicated domains is analyzed , in the current article we exploit the theoretical framework developed in @xcite to study the performance of a two - level and w - cycle multigrid solver .",
    "the possibility to employ general - shaped elements in the physical framework makes the choice of multilevel schemes natural .",
    "the flexibility afforded by this approach allows us to define the set of grids needed in the multigrid algorithm by agglomeration ; thereby , the definition of the associated subspaces is straightforward , since inter - element continuity is not required .",
    "this property overcomes the usual difficulties encountered in the construction of agglomeration multigrid schemes in the conforming framework , where the agglomeration strategy must be followed by a proper definition of the conforming subspaces . in @xcite , for example , the sublevels are obtained by combining a graph based agglomeration algorithm and re - triangulations , thus resulting in a set of non - nested grids , while the associated nested subspaces are defined by introducing suitable interpolation operators .",
    "the resulting v - cycle multigrid algorithm converges uniformly with respect to the meshsize @xmath2 provided that the number of levels is kept fixed .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the convergence of a two - level scheme and w - cycle multigrid method for the solution of the linear system of equations arising from the @xmath0-version of the interior penalty dg scheme on polygonal / polyhedral meshes @xcite , thereby , extending the theoretical framework developed in @xcite for standard quasi - uniform meshes , .",
    "our analysis is based on the smoothing and approximation properties associated with the proposed method : the former corresponds to a richardson iteration , whose study requires a result concerning the spectral properties of the stiffness matrix , while the latter is inherent to the interior penalty dg scheme itself and exploits the error estimates derived in @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "theory ] we introduce the interior penalty dg scheme for the discretization of second - order elliptic problems on general meshes consisting of polygonal / polyhedral elements .",
    "then in section  [ sec : preliminary ] , we recall some preliminary analytical results concerning this class of schemes . in section",
    "[ sec : mulgr ] we define the multilevel framework and introduce several technical results .",
    "we then focus first on the analysis of two - level method , followed by the extension to the w - cycle multigrid solver .",
    "the main theoretical results are investigated through a series of numerical experiments presented in section  [ sec : numerical ] ,",
    "we consider the weak formulation of the poisson problem , subject to a homogeneous dirichlet boundary condition : find @xmath3 such that @xmath4 with @xmath5 , @xmath6 , a convex polygonal / polyhedral domain with lipschitz boundary and @xmath7 a given function in @xmath8 .    for the sake of brevity",
    ", throughout this article , we write @xmath9 and @xmath10 in lieu of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , for a positive constant @xmath13 independent of the discretization parameters .",
    "moreover , @xmath14 means that there exist constants @xmath15 such that @xmath16 . when required , the constants will be written explicitly .    in view of the forthcoming multigrid analysis ,",
    "we denote by @xmath17[j]\\}_{j=1}^j$ ] a sequence of partitions of the domain @xmath18 , each of which consists of disjoint open polygonal / polyhedral elements @xmath19of diameter @xmath20 , such that @xmath21[j]}\\bar{\\ensuremath{\\kappa}\\xspace}$ ] , @xmath22 .",

    "@xmath29 leads to the so - called @xmath2- @xmath1-multigrid schemes .",
