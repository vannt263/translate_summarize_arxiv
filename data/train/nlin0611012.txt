    "the klein - gordon generalised equation is written as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is an arbitrary function of @xmath3 .",
    "the well - known wave equation is obtained with @xmath4 , while @xmath5 leads to klein - gordon equation that describes a particle of mass @xmath6 and spin 0 in relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "both cases are linear and only the latter is dispersive @xcite .",
    "an important nonlinear case is characterised by @xmath7 : @xmath8    equation is the so - called sine - gordon equation and allows soliton - like solutions .",
    "this type of solutions is increasingly important in the description of ( at least partly ) particle - like objects @xcite , which is easy to understand since solitons present very localised momentum and their shape consistency results in effective transportation of energy .",
    "for instance , the @xmath9-mesons are quark - antiquark bound states and some works ( e.g. @xcite ) have been able to estimate pion mass values in good agreement with the experiment by describing pions as breather - like solutions of sine - gordon equation . in other words ,",
    "the quark may be seen as a soliton ( e.g. kink ) and the antiquark as an antisoliton ( e.g antikink ) so that @xmath9 is a bound state of the two .",
    "another example is the josephson junction , where the phase difference between the electronic densities of the superconductors may be modeled by sine - gordon equation which previews the vortex dynamics in type ii superconductors @xcite .",
    "the sine - gordon equation finds also application in classical systems such as coupled pendula @xcite and , finally , light bullet solutions may be identified with optical pulses propagating in different media @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "section [ 2 ] briefly describes the numerical method used , while section [ 3 ] presents the results of the simulations and is organised as follows . in [ 31 ]",
    "the propagation and collision of kink - like solitons is analysed and in [ 32 ] an analogous study is performed for light bullet solutions .",
    "section [ 33 ] characterises the simulation of the collision between light bullets and other sine - gordon solutions and , finally , in section [ 4 ] the most important remarks are drawn .",
    "in bidimensional cartesian coordinates , the ( 2 + 1)-dimension klein - gordon generalised equation becomes @xmath10 . with the normalisation substitutions @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 and loosing the primes , the following equation results : @xmath14    in order to numerically solve",
    ", the finite differences method is implemented in _",
    "mathematica 5.0 _ . a rectangular domain @xmath15 \\wedge x\\epsilon\\left[x_1,x_{n_x}\\right ] \\wedge y\\epsilon\\left[y_1,y_{n_y}\\right ] \\right\\}$ ] is chosen and an @xmath16-point space - time grid is created with uniform steps @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "second - order derivatives are approximately computed through centered second - order differences .",
    "initial conditions are given by the definition of @xmath3 and @xmath20 at time @xmath21 .",
    "as for boundary conditions , for all simulations presented here fixed conditions are used along @xmath22-direction and periodic ones along @xmath23-direction .",
    "one must take into account the convergence conditions of the method , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and , in the case of space - periodic solutions , the spatial grid s resolution has to be adequate : a solution with spatial periodicity through ( a , b)-direction and with period @xmath26 should be represented with some - say , 3 - points per period , that is , @xmath27 .",
    "otherwise , meaningless results may be obtained .",
    "the whole numerical approach reffers to klein - gordon generalised equation .",
    "however , in this paper , only the sine - gordon case is studied ; thus , from now on @xmath7 .",
    "future developments may consider any other case using the same numerical method with the corresponding definition of @xmath2 .",
    "theoretical approaches to ( 1 + 1)-dimension sine - gordon equation @xcite allow one to write an 1-soliton analytical solution in the ( 2 + 1)-dimension case as @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the normalised propagation direction and @xmath32 the position of the center point at @xmath33 .",
    "the case @xmath34 corresponds to the so - called _ kink _ , an ascending step propagating along @xmath31 with velocity @xmath35 .",
    "an example is presented on figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "analogously , @xmath36 corresponds to an _ antikink _ , a descending step propagating along @xmath31 with velocity @xmath37 ( see figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "both kink and antikink behave like solitons since they maintain their shape while propagating .",
    "particular solutions are the cases @xmath38 ( _ standing kink _ ) and @xmath39 ( _ standing antikink _ ) which are stationary .    , @xmath40 and @xmath41 within an @xmath42-point grid defined in @xmath43 \\wedge x\\epsilon\\left[-40,40\\right ] \\wedge y\\epsilon\\left[-40,40\\right ] \\right\\}$ ] . in the sequence of shots time",

    "the dependence on the @xmath6 parameter of the kink solution is studied .",
    "regardless of the value of @xmath6 , a nonlinear trail dued to numerical reasons is always present in the propagation of the kink .",
    "as @xmath6 rises , the trail becomes more significant , which may be explained by the steepening of the step .",
    "indeed , @xmath44 @xmath45 . for @xmath46 or higher ,",
    "the kink is destabilised and no proper propagation is achieved .",
    "another important @xmath6-dependent feature is the propagation velocity .",
    "the theoretical motion is given by @xmath47 @xmath48 ; so , the velocity should be constant and equal to @xmath35 . to determine this velocity numerically , several pairs of time and position of the center point",
    "are registered and a linear fit is applied using _ origin 5.0 _ - an example is presented in figure [ fig4 ] . the results for @xmath49 @xmath50 are presented in table [ table1 ] . it is obvious that greater values of @xmath6 lead to less precision and exactness on the determination of the velocity .",
    "taking into account the last column of table [ table1 ] , the most favourable situation occurs when @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , the next sections will use this kind of kinks ( and the corresponding antikinks with @xmath52 ) as they are less disturbed by numerical errors .",
    "moreover , the fitted values of @xmath53 are close to 0 , which means the law @xmath54 is being followed @xmath55 .",
    "it is interesting to note that all velocities in table [ table1 ] are below 1 ( @xmath56 ) , which is the typical velocity of a wave in the case @xmath4 .",

    "nevertheless , the numerical value of @xmath53 was found to be significantly above 0 for both kinks , which proves that nonlinear interaction has taken place and that it momentarily speeded up both solitons .    in the light bullet case , the propagation was characterised as a function of the parameters @xmath87 and @xmath64 and the most favourable case was identified : @xmath63 . with this configuration , a head - on collision was set up and nonlinear effects in the shape of the light bullets were measured ( through @xmath65 ) .",
    "the shape consistency of the light bullets noticed in the latter collision was also seen in head - on collisions with kink , antikink , standing kink and standing breather .",
    "moreover , a 30@xmath0-collision between a light bullet and a standing kink was set up as well and it reinforced the idea that light bullets and kinks are indeed robust objects .",
    "we also found that the direction of the propagation of the light bullet is maintained after it collides with the kink .",
