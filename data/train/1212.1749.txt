    "it is well known that the equation of state ( eos ) for cold and dense strongly interacting matter plays a key role in the study of the neutron stars in astrophysics @xcite .",
    "the neutron star are presumed to contain the densest matter in the cosmos , which provide a natural laboratory for cold , condensed matter .",
    "the recent observation @xcite of the pulsar psr j1614 - 2230 with a mass of @xmath1 ( @xmath2 denotes the mass of the sun ) gives a strong constraint on the eos of strongly interacting matter .",
    "just as the discovery of neutron led to the idea of neutron star , the conception of quark naturally stimulated many physicists and astrophysicists to suggest that neutron - like star may be quark or hybrid star ( quark or hybrid star is composed , in whole or in part , of quark matter ) @xcite . at present",
    ", it is still not possible to get a reliable eos of quark matter from the first principle of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . in this case",
    ", a commonly used approach in the study of high density quark matter is to give up on first principle calculations and resort to phenomenological qcd models , such as mit bag model @xcite , njl model @xcite , perturbative qcd model @xcite and quasi - particle model @xcite . among these models , the quasi - particle quark - gluon plasma model with a few fitting parameters , has been widely used to reproduce the properties of the qcd plasma at finite temperature and zero chemical potential @xcite . however , due to lack of experimental data on dense strongly interacting matter at zero temperature and finite chemical potential , the phenomenological parameters of quasi - particle model at zero temperature and finite chemical potential has some uncertainties .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is try to constrain the parameters of the quasi - particle model at finite chemical potential based on the most recent astronomical observation @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the quasi - particle model and its parameters . in section iii , the structure of neutron - like star is discussed .",
    "the relation between the parameters of quasi - particle model and mass - radii relation of neutron - like star is also illustrated . through comparison of theoretical results with astrophysical observation @xcite",
    ", one can give a strong constraint on the parameters of quasi - particle model used in the present work .",
    "finally , a summary is given in section iv .",
    "recently , by means of functional integral formalism a model - independent formula for calculating the eos of qcd at finite chemical potential and zero temperature was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . by using this formula the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite obtained an explicit analytic expression for the eos using the quasi - particle model . in this paper",
    ", we shall use the eos of this model to study the structure of the neutron - like star .",
    "the eos in ref .",
    "@xcite is obtained by using path integral method with a effective quark propagator .",
    "this quark propagator has the form of a free quark propagator with a density dependent effective mass .",
    "according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the quark number density reads @xmath3(p)\\gamma_{4}\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath4(p)$ ] is the full quark propagator at finite chemical potential @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the number of colors and of flavors , respectively , and the trace operation is over dirac indices .",
    "according to the above formula , in order to calculate the quark number density , one should know the full quark propagator at finite @xmath5 in advance .",
    "unfortunately , at present no one knows how to calculate the full quark propagator from first principles of qcd .",
    "so , one has to choose some effective model quark propagator as the approximation of the full quark propagator . in this paper",
    "we choose the following model quark propagator proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath8(p)=i\\gamma\\cdot\\widetilde p+m(\\mu),\\ ] ] where @xmath9 and the euclidean gamma matrices satisfy the algebra @xmath10 . here , following refs .",
    "@xcite , we choose the effective quark mass @xmath11 and the effective coupling constant @xmath12 to be : @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 are phenomenological parameters of quasi - particle model . in this work , the current mass of u , d , s quarks is taken to be zero .",
    "it could satisfy chemical equilibrium and neutrality naturally .",
    "then we can use the contour integration method to obtain the quark number density @xmath16 due to the step function in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 4 ) , it can be found that the quark number density vanishes when @xmath5 is below a critical value @xmath17 ( in this work , the value of @xmath17 depends on the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) .",
    "namely , @xmath18 is a singularity which separates two regions with different quark number densities .",
    "this behavior agrees qualitatively with the general conclusion of ref .",
    "now let us turn to the calculation of the eos . according to refs .",
    "@xcite , the eos of qcd at @xmath19 reads @xmath20 where @xmath21 is vacuum pressure which represents the pressure density at @xmath22 . in this paper , we take @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a phenomenological parameter in our present work ( at present one can not calculate its numerical value reliably from first principles of qcd ) . here",
    "it should be noted that eq .",
    "( 5 ) is a model independent formula .",
    "this formula shows that the pressure density @xmath25 at finite @xmath5 and zero temperature is totally determined by the quark number density @xmath26 ( up to a constant term @xmath21 ) .",
    "therefore , the quark number density has the correct behavior required by qcd implies that the pressure @xmath25 also has the correct behavior required by qcd at finite chemical potential and zero temperature .    substituting eq .",
    "( 4 ) into eq . ( 5 ) , we obtain @xmath27 where we have taken @xmath28 . from eq . ( 6 )",
    "it can be seen that the eos of quasi - particle model depends on the model parameters @xmath29 .",
    "moreover , the so - called vacuum pressure @xmath24 is also a parameter which affects the eos in the study of neutron - like star @xcite . in the following",
    ", we shall discuss the relation between parameters @xmath30 and @xmath24 .",
    "the choice of @xmath24 in quasi - particle model is complicated ( depending on the corresponding hadronic eos @xcite and quark eos ) .",
    "the different parameters @xmath30 in quasi - particle model lead to different ranges of @xmath24 . in order to see it clearly ,",
    "let us to define @xmath31 to study the phase transition . here",
    "@xmath32 and @xmath33 denote the pressure of quark matter and hadronic matter , respectively .",
    "@xmath32 can be obtained using eq .",
    "according to the eos in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath34 when @xmath35 .",
    "a physical phase transition infers that @xmath36 intersects with 0 once when @xmath37 , that is @xmath38 , where @xmath39 stands for the second term in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 6 ) . however , the case is not always so simple .",
    "we show @xmath40 in fig .",
    "1 with model parameters @xmath41 , @xmath42 . just as is shown in fig . 1 , @xmath36 is not even a monotonously increasing function .",
    "there are two peaks @xmath43 and @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "we have two choices to get a valid result : ( 1 ) @xmath46 , that is @xmath47 , i.e. , @xmath48 in fig . 1 ; ( 2 ) @xmath49 and @xmath50 , that is @xmath51 , i.e. , @xmath52 in fig",
    "it can be seen that some values of @xmath24 ( i.e. , @xmath53 ) would lead to the result which is not physical .",
    "it may be due to the inconsistency of qgp model and constant vacuum pressure . at present",
    "we do not have a valid method to deal with it , instead , when we use qgp model to study the structure of the neutron - like star , we should pay attention to the range of @xmath24 . for some sets of model parameters @xmath30 , the second choice does not exist because @xmath54 .",
    "1 . the @xmath55 of quark matter described by quasi - particle model ( @xmath56 ) and hadronic matter with different @xmath24    the mass - radii relation of neutron - like star depends obviously on @xmath24 .",
    "the mass - radii relation of the pure quark star and the hybrid star ( with @xmath57 ) with different @xmath24 are plotted in fig .",
    "2 . from fig .",
    "2 it can be seen that for pure quark star lager @xmath24 yields smaller mass and radius , while the case for hybrid star is more complicated .",
    "we will discuss it in part b of section iii .",
    "2 . the mass - radii relations of hybrid star and pure quark star with @xmath57 and different @xmath24",
    "using the eos , we can obtain the structure of a neutron - like star by integrating the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equation @xmath58 the energy density reads @xmath59    in this paper , we consider the interior structure of a neutron - like star composed , in whole or in part , of quark matter . the structure of pure quark star is described totally by the quasi - particle model . the hybrid star which is proposed by the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite has a quark core described by quasi - particle model and a crust of nuclear matter described by the apr hadronic eos @xcite .",
    "in this part , we use the recent observation of @xmath0-solar - mass neutron - like star @xcite to constrain the parameters @xmath30 . in the previous section ,",
    "we show that the larger @xmath24 yields smaller mass , so we can choose the smallest @xmath24 which leads to the valid result to get the maximal mass for every set of @xmath30 .",
    "3.the maximal mass changes with the parameter @xmath14 for different @xmath15 .",
    "the relation between the mass and model parameters @xmath30 is shown in fig .",
    "it can be seen clearly that for the same @xmath15 , the mass for different @xmath14 increases at first , then decreases later .",
    "this is because at first the smallest @xmath60 , larger @xmath14 yields larger mass .",
    "when @xmath24 dominates the maximal mass , larger @xmath14 leads to larger @xmath24 which yields smaller mass .",
    "this two obvious regions come from the different choices of @xmath24 which we discuss in section ii . for different @xmath15 , larger @xmath15 yields larger",
    "mass at first , then the larger @xmath15 leads to smaller mass .",
    "the largest maximal mass to @xmath14 increases with @xmath15 increasing .    with the mass related to the the parameters @xmath30",
    ", we can constrain the parameters with the recent observation of @xmath0-solar - mass neutron - like star @xcite .",
    "we assume it is a pure quark star which can be described by quasi - particle model .",

    "@xcite .",
    "mass of different central potential with different parameters @xmath62 , where @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath24 is chosen to be smallest which is physical to obtain the maximal mass .",
    "the range of @xmath30 is illustrated in fig .",
    "the physical meaning of the parameters @xmath30 is not obvious . here",
    ", we try to understand it from the point of view of the running coupling constant @xmath61 .",
    "the comparison of the experimental data on @xmath61 and the results of @xmath61 calculated with some representative values of @xmath30 are shown in fig .",
    "5 . here , one point should be clarified . in the usual expression of the running coupling constant @xmath64",
    ", @xmath61 is a function of the momentum scale @xmath65 . in our work , in order to understand the physical meaning of @xmath61 , the chemical potential @xmath5 is taken as an energy scale similar to the momentum scale @xmath65 in the expression of @xmath61 . from fig . 5 and fig . 6 ( see below ) ,",
    "it can be seen that the parameters which yield @xmath1 are also consistent with the experimental data on @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we conclude that quasi - particle model with proper parameters is suitable to describe quark matter .    if we assume the central density @xmath5 of quark star to be @xmath66 , from fig .",
    "6 we deduce it is reasonable , then the range of @xmath67 is from @xmath68 . by calculation we can also find that the range of @xmath69 is @xmath70 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , based on a universal argument , it is pointed out that the existence of some singularity at the point @xmath18 and @xmath19 is a robust and model - independent prediction .",
    "the numerical value of critical chemical potential in pure qcd ( i.e. , with electromagnetic interactions being switched off ) is estimated to be @xmath71 ( where @xmath72 is the nucleon mass and @xmath73 is the number of colors ) . here , in order to be self - contained , we shall give an explanation for how this result is derived . according to the argument of ref .",

    "the energy per baryon , @xmath78 , can also be written as @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the nucleon mass .",
    "therefore , the state which minimizes @xmath78 is that for which the binding energy per nucleon , @xmath81 , is a maximum .",
    "empirically , we know that this state is a single iron nucleus at rest with @xmath82 and @xmath83 . however , in qcd without electromagnetism the binding energy per nucleon increases with @xmath84 .",
    "this is the consequence of the saturation of nuclear forces and can be seen from the weizsacker formula . without electromagnetism , only the bulk and surface energy terms are significant for large @xmath85 : @xmath86 with @xmath87 , @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "as @xmath89 , @xmath90 saturates at the value @xmath91 .",
    "this corresponds to the binding energy per nucleon in a macroscopically large sample of nuclear matter as defined by fetter and walecka in @xcite .",
    "therefore , in qcd the critical baryon chemical potential @xmath92 and the corresponding quark chemical potential @xmath17 is @xmath93 .",
    "the range of parameters @xmath30 constrained by the observation of @xmath0-solar - mass neutron - like star @xcite is consistent with it .",
    "the hybrid star was inspired by the idea of the phase transition from quark matter to nuclear matter @xcite .",

    "7 it can be seen that in the large @xmath24 region , the maximal mass tends to @xmath94 .",
