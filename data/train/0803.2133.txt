    "in the presence of a two - particle interaction the low - temperature thermodynamics and the low - energy spectral properties of a wide class of one - dimensional ( 1d ) electron systems is described by the luttinger liquid ( ll ) phenomenology.@xcite one of the characterizing properties of a ll is the complete separation of the fundamental collective spin and charge excitations . in the low - energy limit and for a fixed number of left and right moving electrons the hamiltonian can be written as the sum of two terms describing free bosons for the spin and charge degrees of freedom , both having a linear dispersion with velocities @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , in 1d the bosonic degrees of freedom span the entire low - energy hilbert space at fixed particle number .",
    "this has to be contrasted to the collective spin and charge excitations of higher dimensional fermi liquids which only give a certain part of the spectrum . in many theoretical studies the effect of spin - charge separation was discussed@xcite and",
    "there have been several attempts to find experimental indications for it.@xcite    the low - energy physics of a ll is parameterized by four ( in general ) independent and interaction dependent fundamental velocities @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 . the first two are relevant when the total charge or spin are changed , while the later two are the velocities characterizing the charge and spin current . from these",
    ", @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be computed as@xcite @xmath6    here we are interested in the role of spin - charge separation or more generally in the role of the different interaction dependent velocities on transport through lls .",
    "there is no specific effect on the linear conductance @xmath7 of a linear ll wire connected to a fermi liquid source and drain .",
    "a different situation occurs if a closed ll ring coupled via tunnel barriers to two noninteracting leads is considered .",
    "this geometry allows for interference and an additional parameter can be added to the problem , namely a magnetic flux @xmath8 piercing the ring .",
    "the linear conductance then becomes a periodic function of @xmath8 with a periodicity of one flux quantum @xmath9 .",
    "we here chose units such that @xmath10 .    in ref .",
    "it was argued that for @xmath11 , with @xmath12 and @xmath13 being `` small '' odd numbers , @xmath14 shows characteristic dips whose number for @xmath15 $ ] is given by @xmath16 , with @xmath17 being the noninteracting fermi velocity .",
    "the appearance of such dips might thus be interpreted as an indication of spin - charge separation . restricting the ratio of the charge and spin velocities to such cases",
    ", however requires rather specific interaction parameters which will be hard to realize in experimental systems .",
    "the authors study a continuum model , the tomonaga - luttinger model ( tlm ) .",
    "the central approximation of this work  which can be applied for the above given ratio of @xmath1 and @xmath0is related to the idea that an electron can pass the ring only if the charge and spin can `` recombine '' at the right ( and left ) contact ( for details see below ) .",
    "a dip structure of @xmath14 was also obtained for a small ring described by a lattice model with strong local coulomb interaction , the 1d @xmath18 model.@xcite    we here reinvestigate the zero temperature transport through a ll ring described by the tlm .",
    "we do not rely on the above mentioned approximation of ref .",
    "and present results for arbitrary repulsive interactions , thus being closer to situations which can be realized in experimental setups .",
    "this extends the earlier study and clarifies the range of applicability of the central approximation underlying that work .",
    "more precisely , we find that the approximation of ref .   leads to qualitatively correct results only if the smaller of the two numbers , say @xmath13,@xcite is either @xmath19 , @xmath20 or @xmath21 , with the refinement that for @xmath22 or @xmath21 the other number @xmath12 may not exceed @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , the important role of the charge current velocity @xmath4 as a factor accompanying the magnetic flux in all relevant formulas was largely overlooked so far . while , according to the approximation made in ref .",
    ", the transmission probability exhibits @xmath24 dips over one period of the magnetic flux , we find that the expression @xmath25 gives a much better estimate on the number of dips in almost all cases .",
    "it is thus the charge current velocity and not the velocity @xmath1 of the bosonic modes which is of relevance for the dip structure of @xmath14 .",
    "we also clarify how the two expressions for the number of dips and their respective partial viabilities are related .",
    "transport through ll rings weakly coupled to noninteracting leads was also studied in refs .",

    "this kind of reasoning is applicable whenever the approximate identity @xmath198 does not hold to some sufficiently high degree of accuracy with @xmath212 and @xmath213 [ as it was the case for the example of the dashed line in fig.[polok ] ( c ) ] .",

    "jagla and balseiro argue that , according to the assumptions ( `` recombination '' of spin and charge ) underlying their `` dominant pole '' approximation , the transmission probability would have to be `` very small '' whenever the couplings are chosen such that @xmath218 with integer @xmath219 . in these cases",
    "no poles of the form @xmath143 appear in @xmath220 and charge and spin excitation can not `` recombine '' at finite times at @xmath83.@xcite however , the expectation that the transmission probability is small under these conditions is not confirmed by our calculations .",

    "this observation provides further evidence that the idea that charge and spin excitations have to `` recombine '' at @xmath83 for an electron to pass through the ring is of very limited usefulness in the present context .",

    "the green function of a few lattice site ( up to 8 sites ) isolated @xmath151-@xmath230 ring was computed using exact diagonalization . for @xmath231",
    "this model corresponds to the @xmath232-limit of a one - dimensional hubbard - hamiltonian for the ring .",
    "whenever the intermediate state contains @xmath233 electrons , the transmission probability shows @xmath233 equidistant dips .",
    "the authors argue that in the limit @xmath231 the ratio of the spin and charge velocities becomes @xmath234 and this way try to relate their findings to the ones of ref .  .",
    "it remains , however , unclear how this would explain the observed dip structure in view of the results presented here which unambiguously suggest that @xmath4 and not @xmath1 is the velocity of importance for the number of dips .",

    "in the present paper we have studied the effect of the different velocities characterizing the low - energy physics of a ll on transport through a one - dimensional , metallic ring of correlated electrons .",
    "a magnetic flux piercing the ring was included and the dependence of the transmission probability ( linear conductance ) on the flux was studied .",
    "it was obtained using a relation [ eq .",
    "( [ transmittance1 ] ) ] between the one - particle green function of the isolated ring and the transmission probability .",

    "it proved possible to improve on an approximation suggested in ref .   and to exactly calculate the green functions of the isolated ring for the case of a potential with box - like shape in momentum space .",
    "since only the low - energy properties of the system are relevant , this restriction to a specially shaped potential should not be regarded as severe , in particular because the width of the potential plays practically no role for the results .",

    "for generic repulsive two - particle interactions @xmath240 and @xmath13 will be the smaller of the two integers .",

    "@xmath1 , @xmath0 , and @xmath4 , and thus coupling constants , the number of prominent dips in @xmath158 over one interval of periodicity can be estimated to be an integer close to @xmath25 . the wide applicability of this relation was demonstrated .    that the charge current velocity @xmath4 is a relevant parameter determining the flux dependence of the linear ( charge ) conductance through the ring should not come as a surprise .",

    "a simple picture related to the `` dominant pole '' approximation suggests that electrons can pass the ring only if spin and charge excitations traveling with different velocities ( spin - charge separation ) can recombine at the right contact .",
