    "the population dynamics of biological species that produce offspring once in their lifetime ( semelparous species ) provides a generic system that can display a neimark sacker bifurcation .",
    "a remarkable example is the pacific sockeye salmon ( _ oncorhynchus nerka _ ) , which returns from the ocean to spawn in its native lake and dies afterwards .",
    "the sockeye fry spend one season in the lake , feeding on zooplankton and being eaten by predator fish such as rainbow trout , and then migrate to the ocean , from where they return to spawn at the age of 3 , 4 , or 5 years .",
    "several sockeye populations display large - amplitude oscillations with a period corresponding to the dominant generation time of these fish , a phenomenon generally referred to as cyclic dominance @xcite .",
    "in contrast to conventional predator - prey systems , the dynamics of the sockeye - trout system in the lake is piecewise continuous in time , due to the salmon migrating to the ocean and returning at the age of 4 ( @xmath0 ) years .",
    "this mechanism , which puts the model in the context of delay dynamical systems , will turn out to be one of the crucial ingredients .",
    "the second one is the external periodic drive caused by the yearly rhythm of seasons .",
    "the ratio of these two time scales is thus fixed by an internal mechanism which turns out to be vital for the observed phenomena .    while conventional predator - prey systems typically display a hopf bifurcation @xcite , our piecewise continuous system displays a neimark sacker bifurcation @xcite , i.e. , an oscillatory instability in externally driven systems . since the dominant life span of the salmon is 4 years , the period of the oscillation is naturally close to 4 , and when the control parameter is further increased beyond the bifurcation , the period becomes locked exactly at 4 due to the strong resonance familiar from the theory of the neimark sacker bifurcation @xcite .",
    "resonances and the associated synchronisation phenomena are common features in driven systems , with widespread applications in science and technology ( cf .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "but unlike strong resonances one normally requires a fine tuning of parameters , the subtle synchronisation phenomena like phase locking or universal scaling behaviour commonly related with the quasiperiodic transition to chaos @xcite may be sensitive to perturbations .",
    "in contrast , strong resonances in neimark sacker bifurcations generate very stable periodic motion over large regions in parameter space , and thus can provide a vital mechanism for cyclic dominance in biological systems where noise and parameter fluctuations are prevalent .    in this paper",
    ", we will explore further a model for the population dynamics of the pacific sockeye salmon .",
    "we will show that it can display a second attractor , which has the period 2 and coexists with the attractor of period 4 .",
    "due to the strong resonance , the second attractor is clearly visible in bifurcation diagrams where only one of the 6 dimensions of the system is plotted as function of a control parameter . by using computer simulations",
    ", we will show that the second attractor arises through a flip bifurcation followed by a subcritical neimark sacker bifurcation , and by using a theory that is linearised around the fixed point as well as around the attractor of period 4 , we will show that the flip bifurcation can naturally occur soon after the first neimark sacker bifurcation .",
    "the dynamics of the biomass of sockeye fry @xmath1 , of their predator @xmath2 , and of their zooplankton food @xmath3 in year number @xmath4 during the growth season from spring ( @xmath5 ) to fall ( @xmath6 ) are given by the following set of coupled differential equations @xcite : @xmath7 the terms in these equations represent the biomass changes due to eating and being eaten , and the losses due to respiration and death .",
    "the two feeding terms are given by @xmath8 these functional forms include saturation at high prey densities , and a predator interference term in the denominator ( beddington functional response @xcite ) .",
    "these equations of motion determining the time evolution of the biomass during a single season are supplemented with matching conditions used to determine the biomasses of the species at the beginning of the next season from their values at the end of the previous season(s ) . to keep the model as simple as possible we assume that no major change in the population of predators occurs .",
    "the zooplankton level at the end of one year has no effect on the following year @xcite , but its saturation value in the next season , @xmath9 , shows a dependence on the nutrient input due to the number of spawning adults , and thereby on @xmath10 @xcite . @xmath11",
    "most importantly the matching condition for the sockeye fry population contains the proportion @xmath12 and @xmath13 of surviving sockeye that return to their native lakes at the age of 3 and 5 to spawn and die : @xmath14\\ ] ] on the one hand the model may be considered as a very simple example of a piecewise smooth dynamical system @xcite , where the discontinuities are contained in the matching condition between seasons . on the other hand the model may be considered as a periodically driven non autonomous system where the external drive is provided by the seasons .",
    "it is therefore an obvious approach to consider the stroboscopic map .",
    "if we denote by @xmath15}$ ] the flow of the differential equation ( [ dgl ] ) the biomasses at the beginning and at the end of the year @xmath16 are related by @xmath17}(s_{n+1}(0),p_{n+1}(0),z_{n+1}(0))\\ ] ] the condition ( [ zmatch ] ) tells us that the zooplankton is entirely determined by sockeye population so that @xmath18 drops from eq.([strobmap ] ) as a dynamical variable .",
    "taking eqs.([pmatch ] ) and ( [ smatch ] ) into account the remaining biomass evolution can be written as @xmath19 thus we arrive at a six dimensional time discrete dynamical system .",
    "the computation of the right hand sides , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , requires the integration of the equations of motion , eq.([dgl ] ) , a task which can be accomplished easily by numerical means .",
    "however , the structure of the map ( [ map ] ) , induced by the matching condition ( [ smatch ] ) will turn out to be crucial for the properties of the population dynamics .",
    "it is our main purpose to pinpoint an underlying generic mechanism which creates stable cyclic motion among the populations in our model . for that purpose",
    "we employ a brief bifurcation analysis for realistic combinations of the parameters of the model . given the fairly large number of parameters in our model and the fairly large number of degrees of freedom we just resort to plain numerical simulations .",
    "in fact , employing for our specific purpose numerical continuation tools like matcont @xcite our auto @xcite would be using a sledge - hammer to crack a nut .",
    "in addition , our specific numerical study mimics approaches which could be used in evaluating empirical data , and thus could be a guide for their analysis .    figure [",
    "fig : bifurcation ] shows the bifurcation diagram for a realistic set of parameter values . for each value of the parameter @xmath22",
    ", several initial conditions were drawn at random from uniform probability distributions on a 6-dimensional cube @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "when coexisting attractors were found , these were numerically continued until they became unstable . after a transient time of 5000 years ( longer close to bifurcations )",
    ", the values for @xmath24 were plotted for 20 additional years .",
    "as @xmath22 increases , the fixed point becomes unstable due to a neimark sacker bifurcation , and a quasiperiodic attractor arises . at @xmath25 ,",
    "trajectories can become locked exactly at the period 4 , but the quasiperiodic attractor remains stable until @xmath26 .",
    "this picture is consistent with a neimark sacker bifurcation close to a strong resonance of order 1:4 , which is known to display quite a subtle bifurcation structure @xcite , including the creation of homoclinic tangles .    , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "]    at @xmath38 , a second attractor with period 2 appears .",
    "such a feature is normally not related with the generic strong resonant neimark sacker bifurcation mentioned above .",
    "the two arms of this attractor appear as if they are created as an unstable period two orbit at @xmath39 via a flip bifurcation from the already unstable fixed point .",
    "the unstable arms then become stable at @xmath38 when the complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues moved back into the unit circle . even without continuation tools tracking saddle orbits we are able to vindicate this picture by evaluating the size of the basin of attraction of the period two attractor and by monitoring the transient dynamics .",
    "figure [ fig : trajectorie ] shows an example of the transient dynamics in the stable period two regime . since only every other iteration is displayed the transient consists of a damped oscillation with a period close to 4 . by measuring the decay rate @xmath40 of the oscillations around the stable period two orbit for different values of @xmath22 we determined the bifurcation value @xmath41 with an accuracy of @xmath42 .",
    "sufficiently close to the bifurcation , @xmath40 goes linearly to 0 as the instability is approached ( lower inset in figure [ fig : trajectorie ] ) .",
    "we then estimated the diameter of the basin of attraction by using a one dimensional cross section along the direction of the first salmon population .",
    "initial conditions were distributed along this cross section , and those trajectories which return to the period two state determine the extent of the basin along this direction in phase space .",
    "figure [ fig : basin ] shows the result for the size of the basin , and the characteristic square root law with regard to the distance from the bifurcation point is recorded .",
    "thus the bifurcation which causes the stability of the period two state is clearly a subcritical bifurcation .",
    ", all other parameters are as in figure 1 .",
    "only every second data point is plotted .",
    "upper inset : close - up of the trajectory .",
    "lower inset : decay rate of the oscillations when approaching the instability .",
    "the dashed line is a linear function fitted to the numerically determined decay rates , yielding @xmath43 . ]",
    "all these results demonstrate that the second attractor emerges due to a subcritical neimark sacker bifurcation , and this secondary neimark sacker bifurcation is intimately related to the bifurcation creating the stable period four attractor .",
    "we are now going to uncover the underlying mechanism by analytical considerations .    , and @xmath44 .",
    "the dashed line is a power law with exponent @xmath45 . ]",
    "a linear stability analysis of the dynamical system close to the first neimark sacker bifurcation reveals that the scenario outlined in the previous section is indeed a natural scenario for this type of system .",
    "the continuous population dynamics during the season , together with the matching conditions applied between two seasons , can be viewed as a poincar map , eq.([map ] ) , giving the sockeye and predator biomasses at the end of one year as function of the biomasses at the end of the previous years .",
    "close to the fixed point @xmath46 , the dynamics can be approximated by linear terms .",
    "denoting the distance of the biomasses from their fixed point value by @xmath47 and @xmath48 , the linear approximation of eq.([map ] ) has the form @xmath49 where @xmath50 denote the partial derivatives of the poincar map at the fixed point .",
    "these parameter values can in principle be obtained by a numerical evaluation of the population dynamics , eq.([dgl ] ) , close to the fixed point .",
    "any consistent underlying dynamical model should give a negative value of the parameter @xmath51 , since an increase in trout biomass leads to a decrease in salmon biomass .",
    "the other parameters in eq.([param ] ) have to be non - negative , since more parents imply more offspring and since an increase in salmon biomass leads to an increase in trout biomass .",
    "however , it is notoriously difficult to derive such conditions from equations of motion like eq.([dgl ] ) .",
    "the eigenvalues of the matrix in eq.([linmap ] ) determine the nature of the dynamics near the bifurcation .",
    "when all eigenvalues have an absolute value smaller than 1 , the fixed point is stable , and the dynamics converges to this fixed point .",
    "when the absolute value of one or more eigenvalues is larger than 1 , the fixed point is unstable , and the dynamics approaches a different attractor . the eigenvalues @xmath52 satisfy the characteristic equation @xmath53[\\beta \\bar{\\alpha}-\\alpha(\\bar{\\beta}-\\mu)]=0 \\ , .\\ ] ] in order to understand the possible bifurcation scenarios , we first consider the case that only the parameters @xmath54 , @xmath51 and @xmath55 are nonzero",
    "this means that the four salmon lines are independent from each other , @xmath56 , and from the trout , @xmath57 .",
    "the eigenvalues of the matrix are @xmath55 , 0 , and the four fourth roots of @xmath54 .",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath55 characterises the time evolution of the trout , which is decoupled from the salmon in the considered case .",
    "global stability criteria require this eigenvalue to be smaller than one , @xmath58 .",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath59 is due to the fifth column of the matrix being redundant if @xmath60 .",
    "the four fourth roots of @xmath54 describe the salmon dynamics in the vicinity of the fixed point .",
    "the sequence @xmath61 has trivially the period 4 and simply iterates the initial four values , with an amplitude decreasing for @xmath62 and increasing otherwise .",
    "when @xmath54 is increased from a value smaller than 1 to a value larger than 1 , all four eigenvalues @xmath63 cross the unit circle simultaneously , and the fixed point becomes unstable .",
    "this degeneracy is lifted when the other parameters , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath64 , are made nonzero .",
    "as long as these parameters are not large , one can expect the four main eigenvalues to remain close to the unit circle , implying a ( possibly damped ) oscillation with a period close to 4 .",
    "if the complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues is the first one to cross the unit circle , a neimark sacker bifurcation occurs .",
    "if the negative eigenvalues crosses the unit circle first , a flip bifurcation occurs . for the parameter values chosen in the simulation ( figure [ fig : bifurcation ] ) , the neimark sacker bifurcation",
    "is observed first .",
    "the entire bifurcation scenario can be computed from eq.([chargl ] ) using the schur - cohn - jury criterion @xcite , but the main mechanism which is at the heart of the bifurcation discussed in the previous section can be already uncovered if we resort to a perturbative approach . in order to gain some analytical insights , we assume that the parameters @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath64 are so small that the change in @xmath52 can be calculated approximately by performing a first order taylor expansion in @xmath65 , close to the bifurcation . by implicit differentiation of eq.([chargl ] ) we obtain for the relative change of the eigenvalues close to the unit circle @xmath66 where @xmath67 denotes the eigenvalue of the unperturbed case .",
    "the real part of this ratio @xmath68 determines the stability properties of the eigenmode . as long as the parameter @xmath55 is not too small , i.e. as long as the decay of the trout population is not massive , the negative contribution to the positive real eigenvalue ( the case @xmath69 ) dominates , and this mode remains stable on changing the bifurcation parameter @xmath65 .",
    "thus no saddle node bifurcation is expected to occur .",
    "the order of the other two cases , a bifurcation caused by a negative eigenvalue ( the case @xmath70 ) and a strongly resonant neimark sacker bifurcation ( the case @xmath71 ) is now determined by the balance between the unfolding parameters .",
    "if @xmath72 is sufficiently large compared to @xmath64 , the neimark sacker bifurcation appears first , as the negative contribution to the second case in eq.([evex ] ) is larger ( in modulus ) than the negative contribution to the third case . in quantitative terms eq.([evex ] ) yields for the suppression of the saddle node bifurcation the inequality @xmath73 whereas the neimark sacker bifurcation precedes the flip bifurcation if @xmath74 is satisfied ( remember that @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) .",
    "these considerations show that as long as the coupling between the different salmon lines and between the salmon and the trout is small compared to the coupling between salmon parents and offspring ( i.e. @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 ) , the oscillation period of the population is close to four .",
    "if the coupling between the salmon lines is finite and beyond a threshold value determined by the small coupling between the salmon and the trout ( i.e. by the parameter @xmath64 , cf . eq.([flns ] ) ) the period four oscillating mode becomes unstable first as the bifurcation parameter @xmath54 is increased , and the complex conjugate eigenvalues close to the imaginary axis are pushed towards the unit circle .",
    "the complex conjugate eigenvalues are therefore the first ones to cross the unit circle followed by the eigenvalue on the negative real axis .",
    "but we require as well a decay rate for trouts which is not excessively large , eq.([snsup ] ) , to prevent the saddle node bifurcation to occur .",
    "in fact , in the limit @xmath80 the two conditions , eqs.([snsup ] ) and ( [ flns ] ) become mutually exclusive .",
    "thus the dynamics of the predators play an important role and the scenario would not appear if an adiabatic elimination of the trout population would have been an option . the scenario found in the computer simulations , where first a neimark sacker bifurcation occurs and then a flip bifurcation , is thus a generic scenario in this type of system .",
    "clearly , our linear analysis can not keep track of the stability properties of the period two orbit created in the secondary flip bifurcation .",
    "certainly this orbit inherits its stability properties from the bifurcating fixed point , but we can not predict without a tedious normal form calculation whether the two unstable complex conjugated eigenvalues move back into the unit circle , although such a re - entrance phenomenon is not uncommon . while we observed the subcritical neimark sacker bifurcation on the period-2 orbit for a broad set of parameter values , it did not occur in other regions of parameter space .",
    "but the presented analytical considerations have shown that the stable period two and period four oscillations are caused by the same degenerate neimark sacker bifurcation , and we were able as well to derive criteria for the occurrence of this scenario .",
    "we have shown that a three - species population dynamics model can serve as a model system for observing the coexistence of two attractors , one of period four and one of period two .",
    "this is remarkable , since this type of scenario is of codimension 3 , requiring a neimark - sacker bifurcation occurring with a period close to four , and a third eigenvalue crossing the unit cycle for a nearby value of the control parameter .",
    "we have identified conditions such that the bifurcation of high codimension does not require fine tuning of additional parameters .",
    "first of all , the external stimulus of yearly season and the return of species for spawning provides the strong resonance condition of the neimark sacker bifurcation and the reduction to a time discrete dynamical model .",
    "the second important ingredient is a predator population which actively takes part in the dynamics and can not be taken into account on a plain adiabatic description .",
    "finally a weak coupling between the different spawning populations is required .",
    "while the zooplankton provides the source for keeping the nonequilibrium dynamics going , it does not independently take part in the dynamics but depends solely on the current salmon population .",
    "while our considerations have been based on a simple but realistic model , eq.([dgl ] ) , we should emphasise that the conclusions have a fairly broad remit as the time discrete dynamics ( [ map ] ) only takes a few generic features of the model into account .",
    "population models that have discrete generations can thus represent a natural situation for a scenario that was previously expected to require very improbable special conditions .    at a more fundamental abstract level",
    "the model proposed in this contribution is at the interface between piecewise smooth dynamical systems and driven delay dynamics , both being fields of active research in applied dynamical systems theory @xcite .",
    "although being a standard aspect of bifurcation theory , the mechanism presented here could have a wider impact for the study of robust periodic motion and synchronisation in a large class of experimentally relevant setups in science and engineering ."
