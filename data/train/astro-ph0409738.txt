    "the mrwd ( magnetic rotator wind - disk ) model for the formation of keplerian disks involves two processes .",
    "the first is a fill - up process in which material from a star flows along magnetic field lines and passes through a shock surface to form a pre - keplerian disk region .",
    "the magnetic field supplies angular momentum to the wind and assists the flow of material towards the disk region .",
    "initially , the density in the pre - keplerian region is small and it increases significantly during this process .    the second process occurs after the magnetic force in the disk region becomes small compared to the centrifugal force .",
    "then , super - keplerian material in the pre - keplerian region expands to form a quasi - steady keplerian disk .",
    "if there is no viscosity or inflow into the disk region , angular momentum will be conserved .",
    "the time at which the second process starts depends on the rotational speed , magnetic field strength and rate of fill - up of the disk region . in some stars",
    ", sub - keplerian wind material may continue to flow into the super - keplerian disk region . also , as the angular velocity of the expanding disk approaches a keplerian distribution , magnetorotational instability ( mri ) and viscosity can become important .",
    "when there is inflow or viscosity , the radial extent of the quasi - steady keplerian disk region will be larger . in situations where the magnetic force in the disk is stronger than the centrifugal force at the end of the first process , the disk will continue to maintain its pre - keplerian structure .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] gives a schematic meridional cross - section of a pre - keplerian disk during the fill - up stage .",
    "it shows the magnetic field lines from the stellar surface to the inner and outer end points @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , of the pre - keplerian region . in a meridional plane ,",
    "streamlines of flow from the star to the disk coincide with magnetic field lines .",
    "the _ limiting _ streamline from @xmath4 to @xmath3 separates streamlines that flow into the disk region from the open streamlines that flow away from the star and the disk .",
    "let @xmath5 be a point on the equatorial plane in the pre - keplerian region .",
    "let @xmath6 be the point on the stellar surface that is connected to @xmath5 by a magnetic field line that loops back to a point @xmath7 on the star .",
    "if @xmath8 is the angular velocity at @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the angular velocity at @xmath5 during the pre - keplerian stage will also be equal to @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the angular velocity at @xmath6 to the critical angular velocity at the same point is @xmath9^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the stellar mass and radius , respectively .",
    "@xmath12 is the ratio of the continuum radiation force to gravity . for points on the equatorial plane we put @xmath13 where @xmath14 are spherical polar coordinates .",
    "let @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively , be the points in the pre - keplerian region at which the rotational velocities are equal to the keplerian and escape velocities .",
    "then , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "when the meridional component @xmath19 of the magnetic field at the point @xmath4 on the stellar surface is increased , the value of @xmath20 also increases .",
    "the mrwd model requires that a super - keplerian region be present in the pre - keplerian disk .",
    "hence , @xmath3 must be further away from the star than @xmath15 so that @xmath21 .",
    "thus , @xmath19 must be larger than a minimum value @xmath22 , which is the meridional field strength when @xmath3 coincides with @xmath15 .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] schematically shows the different possible locations of @xmath2 and @xmath3 in relation to @xmath15 and @xmath16 . during the second process",
    ", material between @xmath15 and @xmath16 will move into keplerian orbits .",
    "when there is no viscosity or inflow of wind material , the material beyond @xmath16 will flow away .",
    "if viscosity or inflow becomes important , material in the region between @xmath16 and @xmath3 can become part of a quasi - steady keplerian disk .",
    "a pre - keplerian region having configuration 1 in figure [ fig2 ] will yield a quasi - steady keplerian disk region with maximal radial extent .",
    "the _ optimal model _ corresponds to configuration 5 , where @xmath3 coincides with @xmath16 and @xmath2 coincides with @xmath15 or is closer to the stellar surface than @xmath15 .",
    "this model requires the least magnetic field strength at the stellar surface to form a keplerian disk with the largest radial extent in the absence of inflow or viscosity .",
    "the keplerian region formed when @xmath19 is only slightly larger than @xmath22 will be in the shape of a ring . for larger values of @xmath19",
    "the radial extent of the keplerian region will be larger . in an inviscid model without inflow",
    ", the keplerian region has its largest radial extent when @xmath19 equals @xmath23 , which is the field strength required for the optimal model . for values of @xmath24 larger than @xmath23",
    "there is no increase in the radial extent of the quasi - steady keplerian region as long as the material beyond @xmath16 moves away from the disk region .    when the rotation rate @xmath25 of the sector @xmath26 is approximately constant , the inner radius of a quasi - steady keplerian disk is @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath28 be a point on the outer boundary of the quasi - steady keplerian disk . when there is no viscosity or inflow , we have @xmath29 when @xmath30 and @xmath31 when @xmath32 .",
    "however , if there is flow of wind material into the disk region or if there is an onset of mri during the second process and viscosity becomes significant , the value of @xmath33 will be much larger because of a contribution from material between @xmath16 and @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath34 be the lower bound derived by @xcite for the meridional field to withstand the effects of meridional circulation near the stellar photosphere and let @xmath35 be the turnover time of this circulation .",
    "let @xmath36 be the minimum surface magnetic field required in the mtd model of @xcite . for be stars with realistic rotation rates we have @xmath37 .",
    "also , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the fill - up time of the pre - keplerian disk .",
    "table [ table1 ] gives the critical values of magnetic fields for the formation of disks in different stellar models .",
    "here , we consider models that are appropriate for stars with different values of @xmath0 . although the azimuthal component may also play a role , we do not include it in this discussion .",
    "\\(a ) if @xmath40 , quasi - steady keplerian disks satisfying the mrwd model can be formed .",
    "the surface magnetic field will be affected by meridional circulation near the photosphere .",
    "this can lead to changes in the disk over time scales of order @xmath35 .",
    "\\(b ) when @xmath41 , the mrwd model is appropriate .",
    "the surface magnetic field will be able to withstand the effects of circulation and persist over time periods that are long compared with @xmath35 .",
    "\\(c ) if @xmath42 , the disks will be of mtd type .",
    "if the magnetic field lines from the star thread the disk region and loop back to the star , like field lines of a dipole - type field , the angular velocity distribution in this disk will be the same as that in the region @xmath43 of the stellar surface from which the field lines emerge .",
    "on the other hand , if the field lines from the star pass through the disk region and travel outwards to large distances from the star without looping back , the rotation law for the disk will be similar to the empirical formula specified in the mtd model of @xcite .",
    "the requirement that the disk density should be positive gives the condition @xmath44 for disk formation @xcite .",
    "here , all quantities are evaluated on the appropriate sides of a point @xmath45 on @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the normal component of the wind velocity .",
    "thus , for given values of the equatorial rotation speed and surface magnetic field strength , the wind velocity must be larger than a critical value for a disk to be formed .",
    "since this critical value depends on the stellar rotation speed , a faster rotation rate does not ensure the formation of a shock - compressed disk region unless @xmath47 is correspondingly larger .",
    "the mrwd model does not require that the magnetic field be uniformly strong across the entire stellar surface .",
    "the field must have the required strength on the sector @xmath43 , whose spread in latitude is only a few degrees .",
    "the basic processes in this model do not depend on whether the field is axially symmetric .",
    "the results obtained for symmetrical systems will qualitatively apply to stars possessing magnetic fields with flux loops that thread the disk region .",
    "observational evidence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicates that several stars of the type we consider for disk formation are oblique magnetic rotators with dipole fields .",
    "@xcite find that disk - like structures can form along the magnetic equatorial planes of models with strong magnetic fields in which the alfvn speed is faster than the rotation speed of the magnetosphere .",
    "thus , when the mrwd model is applied to oblique rotators , a pre - keplerian region can be formed along a plane or surface that is determined by gravity , centrifugal force and magnetic force acting on the disk material . during the second process ,",
    "if the magnetic force in the disk becomes small , we expect that super - keplerian material will move into keplerian orbits in the rotational equatorial plane . in the case of oblique rotators with @xmath48 , the results of preuss et al",
    "imply that an mtd disk will be located in the magnetic equatorial plane rather than the rotational equatorial plane .    because the magnetic force in the disk region of the mrwd model becomes small at the end of the fill - up stage , the one - armed spiral pattern of the global disk oscillation model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can be used to explain the v / r variability in disks of be stars .",
