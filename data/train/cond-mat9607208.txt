    "following pioneering work by nozires and blandin@xcite , the multichannel kondo model has attracted much attention because of the prospect of novel , low temperature behavior .",
    "various theoretical methods have been developed to study the nature of the zero temperature kondo fixed points for a variety of cases , in particular with an arbitrary number of channels@xcite and with either one or two@xcite kondo impurities . despite various intriguing predictions ,",
    "no experimental realization of the multichannel kondo effect has yet been conclusively demonstrated .",
    "the difficulty lies in the fact that the non  fermi  liquid fixed points are unstable to various symmetry  breaking processes , such as channel anisotropy , which turn out to be present in real experimental situations .",
    "for example , nozires and blandin@xcite pointed out that anisotropy between the channels , caused by lattice effects , would destroy the non  fermi  liquid ground state .",
    "subsequently , vladr and zawadowski@xcite were the first to suggest a different realization of the two - channel kondo model , with the role of the spins and the channels of the conventional magnetic model interchanged . in this case , a _",
    "non - magnetic _ impurity tunnelling between two sites plays the role of the magnetic spin-1/2 impurity in the original kondo formulation with electrons coupled orbitally to the impurity , while the spin index of the electrons is a spectator , playing the role of the channel index .",
    "therefore , since in the absence of a magnetic field in the magnetic kondo system the spin - up and spin - down electrons are degenerate , channel anisotropy is no longer a problem .",
    "this led vladr and zawadowski@xcite to predict that such a system should exhibit non  fermi  liquid behavior at low temperatures , characteristic of the two - channel kondo ( 2ck ) model .",
    "recently , low temperature tunnelling data by buhrman _ et al_@xcite in very small metallic contacts have been interpreted by buhrman _",
    "et al_@xcite in terms of two - channel kondo - like physics .",
    "their measurements are claimed to be consistent with certain exact results for the 2ck model obtained by affleck and ludwig,@xcite but at this point , the interpretation is controversial.@xcite again , the problem arises from the absence of a symmetry which prevents other relevant terms from appearing ; the most important of these is bare impurity tunnelling , which in the conventional kondo model corresponds to a magnetic field on the impurity . in a previous paper@xcite",
    ", we studied this system in detail and argued that it is very unlikely that 2ck physics could be observable over a substantial temperature range in such a two - site impurity system .    a way to circumvent",
    "the problem of the appearance of relevant operators is to impose symmetry conditions on the orbital degrees of freedom so that the relevant operators which plagued the two - site impurity system are not allowed to appear by symmetry .",
    "the first question that naturally arises is what are the minimum symmetry requirements at some high ( or intermediate ) energy scale so that the system will flow under renormalization ( rg ) towards the non - fermi liquid fixed point , _ without _ any fine tuning .",
    "clearly , the low temperature non - fermi liquid behavior one should be primarily aiming for , is that of the two - channel kondo model due to its relative simplicity .    for tunnelling non - magnetic impurities ,",
    "the `` channel '' ( i.e. spin ) symmetry is ensured , in the absence of a magnetic field , due to time reversal invariance . as for the symmetry of the impurity motion ,",
    "an essential requirement is that at intermediate energies the impurity , dressed with high energy electrons , should behave like a degenerate doublet , just as the impurity spin-@xmath0 does in the conventional 2ck model . for this to be true without any parameter tuning ,",
    "the symmetry group of the system has to allow for degenerate doublets to occur , i.e. it has to have a two dimensional representation .",
    "the simplest group with such a property is the triangular group @xmath1 , which , with six elements , is the smallest non - abelian group .    in this paper",
    "we are thus led to consider a non - magnetic impurity in a metal that can tunnel between the corners of an equilateral triangle . in this case ,",
    "the left and right moving impurity states are related by symmetry and are thus degenerate .",
    "not surprisingly , in order for the system to be in the basin of attraction of the 2ck point , we must require that at some intermediate energy , the left - right doublet of the impurity is the lowest energy orbital state of the impurity .",
    "naively one might expect that this is impossible , since the ground state of a particle in an external potential is very generally non - degenerate .",
    "however , in a solid the impurity interacts with other electrons , including localized atomic electrons , whose state is affected by the impurity motion . by taking these interaction effects into account ,",
    "we explicitly demonstrate in some simple and potentially physically relevant examples , that it is indeed possible for the ground state of the impurity - plus - high - energy - electrons complex to be degenerate .",
    "we then analyze the weak electron - impurity interaction limit , determine the criterion for flowing under the renormalization group ( rg ) toward the 2ck fixed point , and find the energy scale below which the low lying impurity doublet becomes substantially separated from the excited symmetric orbital state . below this energy scale",
    "the impurity complex can be regarded as a degenerate doublet , and the system can be mapped to a 2ck model with only irrelevant perturbations away from the intermediate coupling 2ck fixed point . as a result , the 2ck fixed point is accessible at low temperatures for generic values of the bare couplings provided that the conditions for an impurity doublet obtain .    in order to demonstrate the existence of novel 2ck - like behavior at low temperatures ,",
    "one must do more than show that the rg flows at zero temperature go to the 2ck fixed point . as shown by affleck , ludwig and others , the singular low temperature behavior of various physical quantities in the 2ck model",
    "is controlled by the _",
    "leading irrelevant operators _ about the 2ck fixed point : i.e. by the flow towards the fixed point .",
    "we must thus show that the structure of the irrelevant operators for the tunnelling impurity system is similar to that of the 2ck model .",
    "indeed , we will show that the scaling dimension of the leading irrelevant operators , which characterize the form of the singularities in physical quantities at low temperatures , is the same in the two cases .",
    "however the _ number _ of leading irrelevant operators is larger for the tunnelling impurity system . analyzing the behavior close to the 2ck fixed point ,",
    "we find _ four _ leading irrelevant operators , in contrast to the pure 2ck model , which has only two , due to the fact that our problem does not have the full symmetry of the conventional 2ck problem , @xmath2 .",
    "we thus conclude that since different physical quantities can have singularities controlled by different combinations of the various leading irrelevant operators , various amplitude ratios and scaling functions will be less universal than in the 2ck problem , although the _ form _ of the singular low temperature behavior will be the same .    in real systems , there will of course generally be some  hopefully small  symmetry - breaking perturbations . by studying the relevant symmetry breaking perturbations , in particular strains ,",
    "we conclude that their effective strength will generally be _ screened _ by the fluctuations at the 2ck fixed point , making their effects less important than would be guessed by naively comparing energy scales .",
    "however , for the experiments by buhrman and collaborators@xcite simple order - of - magnitude estimates show that the strains have to be extremely small for the 2ck fixed point to be approached .    within the space of full triangular symmetry",
    ", we find that by tuning the splitting between the impurity doublet and the singlet states , ( e.g. by pressure ) there will be a phase transition at zero temperature from the 2ck behavior to conventional fermi liquid behavior .",
    "this transition is conjectured to be controlled by a fixed point with @xmath3 orbital symmetry .",
    "impurity configurations with high symmetry , such as cubic , are also discussed briefly , and found to be characterized , up to _ additional _ leading irrelevant operators , by the 2ck fixed point .      in the next section",
    "we motivate and introduce the model we will be using . in section [ sec : iiic3v ] , we discuss the importance of the impurity degeneracy and analyze three physically relevant situations , for which the impurity ground state can indeed be two - fold degenerate .",
    "the weak coupling analysis is performed in section [ sec : ivc3v ] , at which the crossover from the 3-site problem to a degenerate 2-level impurity system , as well as @xmath1-symmetry breaking processes are discussed .",
    "in section [ sec : vc3v ] , the intermediate coupling regime for the 2ck system is studied , while in section [ sec : vic3v ] conjectures about the behavior on and near the the critical manifold separating 2ck from conventional fermi liquid behavior are made .",
    "finally , we conclude in section [ sec : viic3v ] with the potential relevance of the model to experimental situations and , in particular , to recent experiments by buhrman and collaborators.@xcite",
    "in this section we introduce an effective hamiltonian for the impurity and conduction electron system , valid at some intermediate energy scale substantially less than the conduction electron bandwidth .",
    "the effects of higher energy electronic processes have already been taken into account by introducing renormalized parameters in the effective hamiltonian .",
    "it is crucial that at this intermediate energy scale all processes that are allowed by symmetry will be present , even if they were absent in the `` bare '' hamiltonian .",
    "therefore we have to include all processes that are relevant ( in the rg sense ) at _ either _ weak or intermediate coupling , since their amplitudes , albeit small initially , can grow under the rg flows .",
    "[ other processes that are irrelevant for both weak and intermediate coupling will end up yielding at worst non - universal order one corrections to the various quantities of interest . ]    since the impurity - electron interactions are predominantly local , the electronic degrees of freedom which interact most strongly with the impurity at low energies can be viewed as centered around the three minimum energy positions of the impurity .",
    "therefore for low enough energies we only need to consider three electronic wavefunctions for each energy and each spin . these can be represented as a symmetric state @xmath4 with spin @xmath5 and energy @xmath6 , transforming according to the trivial representation @xmath7 of @xmath1 , and an orbital doublet \\{@xmath8 , @xmath9 } , in the two dimensional representation , @xmath10 .",
    "neglecting weaker interactions of the impurity with other electronic @xmath11-doublets , @xmath12-singlets and antisymmetric @xmath13-singlets will not change the behavior of the system . in an analogous way the impurity states can be described by a @xmath10-doublet @xmath14 , @xmath15 and the symmetric state @xmath16 .    before introducing the effective hamiltonian @xmath17 ,",
    "let us summarize its symmetries .",
    "impurity and electron numbers are separately conserved , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "in addition , in the absence of spin - orbit coupling or magnetic fields , our system has spin-@xmath20 and time reversal symmetry .",
    "the latter acts also on the orbital degrees of freedom : @xmath21 ; @xmath22 ; @xmath23 . finally , @xmath17 has the @xmath1 symmetry , which includes exchange symmetry around an axis ( @xmath23 ; @xmath22 ) and rotational symmetry by @xmath24 : @xmath25 c_l $ ] ; @xmath26 c_r $ ] ; @xmath27 and similarly for the @xmath28 s .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath17 includes several types of terms : @xmath29 with @xmath30 the electron kinetic energy in the absence of the impurity @xmath31,\\ ] ] with the energy @xmath6 measured from the fermi surface .",
    "note that for convenience we consider a linear conduction band with a cutoff of order the bandwidth @xmath32 .",
    "although we will generally work in the @xmath33,@xmath34,@xmath35 representation , in order to see the physical origin of various terms , it is convenient to first work in a basis of wave - functions centered around the three equivalent impurity sites , with @xmath36 for @xmath37 .",
    "if the impurity is at rest , then the only allowed one electron terms are @xmath38 and @xmath39 the other such terms consistent with the symmetries can be rewritten , using @xmath40 , in terms of these two and terms which mix the electronic states centered at the different sites : @xmath41\\ ] ] which must , in any case , be present due to the non - orthogonality of the @xmath42 states.@xcite [ we ignore the unimportant term @xmath43 .",
    "the bare impurity hopping term can be written @xmath44 where the @xmath45 and @xmath46 are related as in eq([c_n ] ) .",
    "the sign of @xmath47 is of crucial importance . in particular",
    ", if all electron - impurity interaction terms are much smaller than @xmath48 , then the sign of @xmath47 determines whether the impurity ground state is an orbital singlet ( @xmath49 ) or a @xmath10 doublet ( @xmath50 ) . at energy scales such that the renormalized electronic bandwidth is smaller than @xmath51 ,",
    "in which case tunnelling events of the impurity from the ground state configuration to excited states will be suppressed , the low temperature behavior clearly depends crucially on the symmetry of the impurity ground state in the absence of interactions .    of course ,",
    "as was noted in the introduction , naively the sign @xmath47 should generally be negative to ensure a non - degenerate ground state .",
    "however , situations can exist for which the interaction of the impurity with atomic ( high energy ) electrons conspires to make the effective low energy impurity hopping matrix element @xmath47 positive and hence favor the _ doublet _ impurity ground state .",
    "some illustrative examples are discussed in the next section .",
    "in addition to the bare impurity hopping , various `` electron assisted '' impurity hopping terms ( @xmath52 ) can occur .",
    "these may involve either terms of the form @xmath53 or @xmath54 with @xmath55 . at the fermi surface",
    "there are six independent such terms with coefficients @xmath56 . in the @xmath57 basis , these give rise to several terms that are diagonal in this basis : @xmath58 where @xmath59 , for @xmath60 , are the `` local '' electron creation operators , represented as @xmath61 where @xmath62 are the incoming ( outgoing ) electronic @xmath63-wave states for @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "the effect of the first two of these terms is to screen transitions between the different states @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath33 of the impurity.@xcite their amplitudes @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 correspond to linear combinations of various electron - assisted tunnelling processes @xmath69 and , @xmath66 and @xmath67 will be assumed to be positive .",
    "if @xmath70 , then it will be seen later that the system behaves like a ferromagnetic kondo model [ see discussion after eq([weakrgeqdelta3 ] ) ] . in order for these important terms to be of appreciable magnitude ( in section [ sec : vc3v ]",
    "we will allow @xmath66 to be of order unity ) , we focus on impurities with relatively fast ( renormalized ) tunnelling rates .    the interaction terms @xmath71 and @xmath72 give rise to a number of processes in the @xmath57 basis which change the state of the impurity ; to be consistent with @xmath1 symmetry the total orbital `` angular momentum'' with @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75  of each of these terms must be zero ( mod 3 ) .",
    "the electron assisted hopping terms @xmath76 also contribute to @xmath77 .",
    "we have @xmath78 in the absence of impurity motion , @xmath79 is zero , but @xmath80 has contributions from both electron - impurity interactions and electron - assisted hopping and is thus still non - zero .",
    "of all the terms we have so far , @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the only processes , that _ break _ the @xmath83-symmetry in the @xmath84-manifold ( which , using different notation , was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of the two - site tunnelling impurity ) .",
    "however , these terms are clearly @xmath1 invariant and their effects will be discussed in later sections .",
    "the terms we have included so far can be conveniently grouped into @xmath85 and the @xmath79 and @xmath77 combinations exhibited above .",
    "the electron mixing term , as it is diagonal in the @xmath57 basis , will not play a substantial role ( in contrast with the two - site case of ref .",
    "in addition to the various impurity one - electron coupling terms , the impurity can also affect electron - electron interactions , and two - electron assisted hopping can take place .",
    "although these terms are strongly irrelevant for weak coupling as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the latter can play an important role near the intermediate coupling 2ck fixed point ; we denote them as @xmath86 . putting all the important terms together",
    ", we primarily study the effective hamiltonian @xmath87    at this point , one can immediately guess which terms will play dominant roles at very low energy scales where , with @xmath47 positive , the higher energy symmetric impurity state @xmath16 will be strongly suppressed . in this limit , the most important terms will be @xmath66 which is analogous to the @xmath88 coupling in the kondo system , and @xmath89 which is analogous to the @xmath90 coupling .",
    "the only other one - electron term which does not involve @xmath91 is @xmath81 which involves the @xmath92 electrons and breaks the @xmath83 symmetry of the @xmath93 subspace .    in general there can also be @xmath1-symmetry breaking processes , but , by assumption , these will be small . nonetheless we will need to investigate their role .",
    "the most important terms correspond to bare impurity transitions from state @xmath34 to @xmath35 , such as @xmath94 or from @xmath34 and @xmath35 to @xmath33 , such as @xmath95 .",
    "[ note that @xmath96 and @xmath97 can not appear if the system is time - reversal invariant ] .",
    "these will originate from various effects , including strains , other nearby static impurities etc .",
    "of the above processes , the one corresponding to @xmath98 will be the most important to our discussion , because it will persist even on energy scales below which @xmath47 becomes larger than the renormalized bandwidth and transitions to the @xmath33-state are effectively quenched .",
    "the real part of @xmath98 will be a linear combination of two independent bare impurity terms that are even under parity @xmath99 , i.e. an energy bias term @xmath100 and an asymmetry in the hopping amplitudes @xmath101 , while in the imaginary part of @xmath98 similar terms will appear which are odd under parity .",
    "thus , two independent parameters have to be tuned for @xmath102 to vanish .",
    "finally , note that asymmetries in the electronic states due to other impurities etc .",
    ", can generate @xmath98 under renormalization .",
    "as already mentioned , the degeneracy of the lowest lying effective impurity state at intermediate energy scales is crucial to our analysis . the generic case of a non - degenerate impurity ground state",
    ", corresponding to @xmath103 , leads to uninteresting impurity screening and hence to ordinary fermi - liquid behavior at low temperatures . instead , a doubly degenerate @xmath10 orbital impurity state will be our focus , and in this section we will show how the necessary condition , @xmath50 , is possible .",
    "first , we will analyze in two model cases the effects on the impurity motion of high energy atomic or valence electrons in solids , ignoring coupling to the conduction electrons .",
    "the impurity will be assumed to move slowly on the scale of the atomic electronic time scales .",
    "we can thus consider the adiabatic evolution of the electronic ground state as the impurity moves . in the second part of this section",
    "we will demonstrate how , when we include the conduction electrons , the existence of intermediate excited impurity configurations between the low lying states @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , can serve as a mechanism for changing the sign of the effective @xmath47 at lower energies .",
    "we focus first on an orbital- and spin - singlet interstitial impurity , tunnelling between three equivalent positions1 , 2 and 3on the corners of an equilateral triangle .",
    "the underlying physical reason for the desired effect on the sign of @xmath47 is the appearance of degeneracies in the states of the surrounding medium ( electrons and neighboring nuclei ) when the impurity is located at a position of special symmetry  in our case , the center of the triangle .",
    "even if the impurity is forbidden energetically from occupying this central symmetric position , e.g. by the presence of a host lattice atom , the effect is manifested in the behavior of the wavefunctions of the system when the impurity is away from the center .",
    "the simplest example is an atomic electronic state on the impurity , which , with the impurity located in the center of the triangle , is doubly degenerate , i.e. an @xmath107 doublet .",
    "when the impurity is at , say , site 1 , the degeneracy is broken .",
    "however , by adiabatically moving the impurity once around the triangle and back to site 1 , the electron returns to its original state , but with its wavefunction multiplied by a factor of @xmath108 .",
    "the extra phase acquired by the electronic state is just berry s phase;@xcite it will change the sign of the effective impurity - plus - electron tunnelling matrix elements .    with one electron in an appropriate energy level on the impurity ,",
    "this effect can occur but the impurity will be magnetic .",
    "what is needed instead is an _ orbital _",
    "( non - magnetic ) electronic doublet on the impurity when it is at the center of the triangle .",
    "this is a situation which is a classical example of the jahn - teller@xcite effect and was also proposed recently in this context by gogolin.@xcite due to the coupling of the electronic doublet of the impurity and the neighboring atoms , the triangle - center position of the impurity is unstable to displacements of the impurity from its equilibrium position : this linearly splits the electronic degeneracy , but only costs elastic energy that is quadratic in the distortion .",
    "a massive impurity will be displaced to one of three minimum energy equilibrium positions on the corners of an equilateral triangle .",
    "but , since the impurity wavefunctions at these three positions will generally have a finite overlap , the impurity can tunnel between them .",
    "the phases of the tunnelling matrix elements add up to @xmath109 on tunnelling around the triangle , yielding an extra minus sign from the berry s phase .",
    "this ensures that the tunnelling @xmath10-doublet will be the ground state of the impurity complex .",
    "this restoration of the degeneracy via tunnelling of the impurity is a dynamic jahn - teller effect  the triangular symmetry is not broken in the ground state and the original electronic doublet has merely been modified into an impurity orbital doublet .",
    "unfortunately , orbital electronic doublet ground states at high symmetry positions of an impurity are not too common .",
    "instead , in many cases the minimum energy configuration has magnetic character , due to hund s rules splittings .",
    "nevertheless , for large enough local lattice distortions due to the impurity , the effective tunnelling impurity ground state can still be a doublet . to explicitly demonstrate this effect , we consider a simple situation with four atomic electrons on the impurity , perturbed by the surrounding medium , with spin - orbit interactions neglected .",
    "for simplicity we consider only three electronic levels which , with the impurity in the central point with triangular symmetry , will have the symmetry of the @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath33 states , corresponding to angular momentum of @xmath110 ( mod 3 ) respectively .",
    "we denote the creation operators for these @xmath111 .",
    "if the environment is such as to make the atomic one - electron @xmath33 state the lowest by energy @xmath112 , two electrons will fill this and the other two will go in the degenerate @xmath34 , @xmath35 states .",
    "the simplest situation is with effective electron - electron interactions smaller than the splitting @xmath112 . in this case",
    ", hund s rules will give rise to ferromagnetic exchange , @xmath113 , between the two @xmath34 or @xmath35 electrons , resulting in a spin triplet @xmath114 ground state , with orbital angular momentum ( mod 3 ) , m=0 , a doublet pair @xmath115 of spin singlet , @xmath116 states ( @xmath117 and @xmath118 ) , and a higher energy symmetric singlet , @xmath119 , excited state .",
    "coupling to the one - electron @xmath33 states will mix , e.g. , @xmath120 in with the @xmath121 state with some amplitude @xmath122 .",
    "these processes can be represented by a hamiltonian for the impurity at the triangle center , @xmath123 [ note that if all four electrons are considered together , with the effective interactions being larger than the one - electron splittings caused by the environment , hund s rules would still result in an @xmath124 triplet ground state , but with the lowest excited states also being spin - triplets . ]",
    "= 3truein    motion of the impurity away from the triangle center by a displacement @xmath125 with @xmath126 in the direction of one of the three neighboring atoms , will give rise to mixing of the one - electron states via terms of the form @xmath127 \\\\ \\nonumber & -&\\delta_2 \\sum_{\\sigma = \\uparrow , \\downarrow } \\left [   a^\\dagger_{r\\sigma } a_{s\\sigma }   ( x+ iy ) + a^\\dagger_{l\\sigma }   a_{s\\sigma } ( x - iy )   + h.c . \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these will give rise to splittings of the doublet excited state that are _ linear _ in the displacement ; this is just what - would - be the jahn - teller splitting if the doublet had been the ground state .",
    "if the displacement is directly towards or away from one of the triangle corner atoms , say , with @xmath128 , the states can still be categorized as even or odd under reflection through that atom .",
    "the even state will also mix with the @xmath124 spin singlet excited state .",
    "we are interested in distortions large enough that the ground state is no longer the spin triplet , but one of the even or odd singlet states .",
    "it can readily be seen in simple models , like the one above , that this can occur , at least in principle",
    ". there will be then , for a classical impurity , three equivalent spin - singlet ground states , with displacements @xmath129 , @xmath130 .",
    "in general , the lowest action tunnelling path between these positions will go around the excited state doublet degeneracy in the center of the triangle , and hence pick up a minus sign from berry s phase .",
    "= 3truein    unfortunately , there may also be other degeneracies in the spin singlet sector that can play a role .",
    "in particular , level repulsion between the even singlet states along the line @xmath128 ( and two equivalent lines ) , can result in a second crossing between the even and odd singlet states .",
    "it should be stressed that these extra level crossings @xmath131 [ see fig.[fig : berrypaths ] ] are _ distinct points _ , occuring only when the impurity lies on one of the three lines of symmetry , so that the two low - lying singlet states have different ( even - odd ) symmetry and hence can cross , see fig.[fig : e(x ) ] . in particular ,",
    "if the modification of the effective interactions by the distortion is small , ( e.g. for @xmath132 with no modification of the interactions that give rise to @xmath113 and @xmath122 due to the distortion ) , the main effect of the distortion will be the repulsion between the even singlet states ; this situation is shown schematically in fig.[fig : e(x ) ] . in this case",
    "the degeneracies and region of spin singlet or triplet ground states are shown in fig.[fig : berrypaths ] .",
    "if the lowest action tunnelling path is like that denoted by `` a '' in fig.[fig : berrypaths ] , _ four _ degeneracies in the spin singlet sector will be encircled as the impurity moves around the triangle , resulting in four minus signs and hence a conventional symmetric orbital ground state of the tunnelling impurity , i.e. @xmath133 . on the other hand , if the impurity tunnels via a path like that shown as `` b '' in fig.[fig : berrypaths ] , only the triangle center degeneracy will be encircled and the tunnelling ground state will be the impurity @xmath93 doublet . either possibility can occur .",
    "it should be mentioned that if the repulsion between the electronic states ( @xmath113 , @xmath122 ) is also modified by the distortion , then the three extra degenerate points can be made to disappear in simple models , thereby leaving only the triangle center degeneracy and only paths of type `` b '' possible , hence making the impurity ground state a doublet .",
    "note that spin flip effects can complicate matters somewhat , but will not change the overall conclusion .",
    "we have shown in this section that the existence of an electronic degeneracy in either the ground state or some particular excited state when the impurity is located in a special , albeit energetically unfavorable , point in space ( the triangle center ) can be responsible for the restoration of that degeneracy for the combined impurity - plus - environment system .",
    "this only occurs in some regimes of atomic electron interactions and couplings to the environment .",
    "clearly , a complicated calculation would be required to determine the amplitudes of the various processes reasonably accurately in an actual physical example .",
    "furthermore , the above analysis is valid only when the impurity moves slowly compared to the atomic electron time scales .",
    "one should note that the above assumption , although intuitively obvious in many cases ( especially away from electronic level crossings ) is still controversial.@xcite however the above discussion demonstrates that , at least in principle , the appearance of a berry phase , and therefore an orbitally degenerate impurity ground state , is indeed possible .      in realistic situations , impurity tunnelling rates",
    "will probably be appreciable if the barriers between the three impurity positions are relatively small .",
    "therefore the excited energies of intermediate impurity configurations that are comparable to these barriers , will be substantially lower than the bandwidth . as a result ,",
    "a considerable fraction of conduction electron excitations will have energies large enough to allow transitions between the low lying and these excited impurity states .",
    "however , since the electronic excitation spectrum is continuous in the thermodynamic limit , the impurity motion can not be treated adiabatically for these energies , as it was for the atomic electron states discussed above . instead",
    ", the conduction electron assisted tunnelling of the impurity between the low lying and these excited states can be analyzed systematically by rg scaling .",
    "here we show how the existence of an excited impurity configuration can lead to a positive effective @xmath47 at low energies via coupling to conduction electrons .    for simplicity , we only consider two sites , with the low lying impurity states at each site being @xmath104 , @xmath105 .",
    "let @xmath134 denote an intermediate excited impurity state , with extra energy @xmath135 , that is large compared to the bare impurity tunnelling matrix element between sites 1 and 2 , but small compared to the bandwidth @xmath32 ( @xmath136 ) , see fig.[fig : excitedstate ] .",
    "in this regime we can perform a two - stage renormalization procedure : initially we include the excited state , allowing electron assisted tunnelling events between states 1 , 2 and @xmath137 , these may have tunnelling amplitudes @xmath138 much greater than @xmath47 .",
    "then , when the renormalized bandwidth becomes of the order of @xmath135 or smaller , excitations of the impurity to state @xmath137 will become negligible , in which case we can drop the excited state from the effective hamiltonian . thus the effect of the impurity excited state can be described by the following terms @xmath139 where @xmath140 is an extra local electronic state , which is even under the exchange of site indexes 1 and 2 and @xmath141 is the _ average _ mixing amplitude of conduction electron states 1 and 2 in the presence of the impurity .",
    "note that in the absence of the impurity , @xmath141 ( together with the other terms in @xmath142 ) will vanish , restoring the orthogonality of states 1 and 2 .",
    "in general , both @xmath138 and @xmath141 are energy dependent.@xcite for simplicity , we only consider their constant part , evaluated at the fermi energy .",
    "energy dependent deviations will introduce corrections but will not qualitatively change the behavior described here.@xcite a crucial observation is that @xmath141 can be positive or negative due to two effects .",
    "first , as it was seen in ref .",
    "@xcite , since @xmath143 , @xmath144 involve electronic excitations in the conduction band , @xmath141 is an oscillatory function of @xmath145 , where @xmath146 and @xmath35 are the fermi wavevector and the intersite distance , respectively .",
    "roughly , this oscillatory behavior corresponds to the amplitude of an electron at the fermi energy tunnelling between sites 1 and 2 .",
    "second , since it is the presence of the impurity that causes the mixing of the otherwise orthogonal states 1 and 2 , @xmath141 should also depend on the impurity - electron coupling . as a result , its sign should also depend on the sign of the coupling.@xcite    = 3truein    neglecting all other terms involving the impurity , in this regime the rg equation of @xmath47 normalized by the conduction bandwidth @xmath32 is @xmath147 while @xmath141 and @xmath138 are marginal ( for weak electron - impurity interaction ) .",

    "the impurity is limited to hops between the low lying states @xmath104 , @xmath105 ( and @xmath106 ) , with an effective hopping @xmath152 .",
    "note that since the @xmath134 state has appreciable amplitude in both wells , @xmath153 may be larger than @xmath47",
    ". therefore @xmath154 may be comparable to @xmath47 , and , since the sign of @xmath141 is arbitrary , @xmath150 may be positive or negative , whatever @xmath47 may have been originally . [",
    "note that there will also be contributions to @xmath155 from hops @xmath156 _ not _ involving electrons , but these need not dominate over the electron - assisted process included here .",
    "the effects of an excited impurity configuration were first considered by zarnd and zawadowski@xcite in the context of an impurity tunnelling between two sites , in order to show that the one - electron assisted tunnelling between the low - lying levels ( which , for simplicity , we did not consider here ) can be enhanced .",
    "however , they did _ not _ consider the equally strong enhancement of the tunnelling rate of the impurity _ alone _ , which we analyzed above . ]    in summary , we have presented three situations which can result in an impurity @xmath93 doublet ground state at low energies .",
    "the first two ( section [ sec : iiic3v].1 ) involved the effect of localized atomic electrons with energies far from the fermi level . in the third case ( section [ sec : iiic3v].1 ) we saw that , closer to the fermi level , conduction electrons in the presence of excited impurity configurations can renormalize the effective bare tunnelling element @xmath47 , so that it can take either sign .",
    "after all these effects have been taken into account , at intermediate energy scales the coupling of the remaining conduction electron degrees of freedom to the impurity can be represented by the _ effective _ renormalized coupling terms introduced in section [ sec : iic3v ] ; these will now be analyzed .",
    "in most physical situations , it is likely that the bare impurity tunnelling @xmath47 and the electron assisted tunnelling processes will be small . if the impurity - position - dependent electron - impurity interactions @xmath71 and @xmath72 are also small , then there will be a simple crossover at an energy scale of order @xmath47 . at lower energy scales , the processes that involve @xmath91 will be strongly suppressed ; those remaining will be @xmath89 , @xmath66 and @xmath81 . by this crossover scale , the various @xmath157 and @xmath158 , as they are all marginal for weak coupling , will only have been modified from their original values by amounts quadratic in the various couplings ; @xmath155 will have been renormalized similarly in addition to its simple growth under renormalization with eigenvalue one . for weak coupling , two - electron terms , like those in @xmath159 , will be irrelevant with eigenvalue @xmath108 and hence will be negligible at the crossover scale .    beyond this crossover scale for weak interactions , the couplings other than @xmath89 , @xmath81 and @xmath66 can be ignored ( at least for now ) , but these will renormalize each other . with all three of these small the flow equations in this regime are @xmath160 ( reflecting the approximate @xmath20 symmetry for @xmath161 ) and @xmath162 if @xmath163 , then the system is like a ferromagnetic kondo problem so that @xmath89 flows to zero and the ground state will be an impurity orbital doublet .",
    "we thus restrict consideration to @xmath164 .",
    "since @xmath66 involves impurity hopping but @xmath89 does not , we expect @xmath165 , although this need not be the case .",
    "we thus see that @xmath166 will tend to decrease in the interesting regime , while @xmath66 and @xmath89 increase .",

    "indeed , for sufficiently large @xmath71 and/or @xmath72 some of these can be more relevant than @xmath47 , although in this case the feedback of these into @xmath47 will become important .",
    "likewise , @xmath47 combined with @xmath178 will generate the electron - assisted hopping terms if these do not already exist .",
    "thus for strong interactions , the weak tunnelling crossover will be rather complicated with several processes potentially playing significant roles .",
    "but the coupling of primary importance for the kondo - like physics , @xmath89 , can itself be quite large initially ; in this case the kondo temperature will essentially be when @xmath47 becomes of order the renormalized bandwidth i.e. @xmath179 with @xmath180 .",
    "note that initially @xmath66 will not be generated by the @xmath181 terms , although they will affect its renormalization , but once the effective @xmath47 becomes appreciable , @xmath66 will be generated by @xmath89 as in eq([weakrgeqnsq1delta1 ] ) and then rapidly become of order unity .",
    "the dominant @xmath1 symmetry breaking process is given by eq([c3vbreakingterms ] ) .",
    "for weak coupling @xmath98 is relevant with eigenvalue one . beyond the crossover energy scale",
    "at which @xmath171 becomes large , @xmath98 can be renormalized non - trivially by @xmath66 and @xmath89 . if @xmath89 is large , there will not be a substantial regime in which this will occur and we can simply use the magnitude of @xmath98 at this crossover as an input to the flows in the interesting intermediate coupling regime analyzed in the next section . on the other hand",
    "if @xmath89 ( and @xmath66 ) is small , then there will be a regime of non - trivial renormalization of @xmath98 , with corrections to its eigenvalue of order @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",
    "but since the logarithmic range of scales over which this will obtain is of order @xmath184 , the net effect of this will be small .",
    "thus in both regimes , the weak tunnelling crossover will not appreciably alter the effective magnitude of the dominant symmetry breaking perturbations .",
    "we now analyze the intermediate coupling regime and show how two - channel kondo - like behavior arises .",
    "we work in the regime where the gap between the symmetric impurity state and the lower lying @xmath185-doublet is much larger than the renormalized electronic bandwidth , i.e. at energy scales much less than the kondo temperature @xmath167 . in this case",

    "these operators by themselves would break the @xmath294-charge symmetry of the model ; since they involve an odd number of electron operators , they have charge 1 . [ in our bosonization scheme , this is manifested in them changing sign under @xmath295 .",
    "furthermore , they clearly transform as a spin - doublet .",

    "it should be noted that the operator @xmath98 in eq([c3vbreakingterms ] ) can also be generated through electronic processes that break the triangular symmetry caused , e.g. , by the presence of static impurities in the vicinity of the tunnelling impurity .",
    "these give rise to mixing between the electronic wavefunctions interacting with the tunnelling impurity or between these and other wavefunctions.@xcite this mixing breaks the @xmath1 symmetry . in the presence of electron - assisted - tunnelling processes , such as",
    "@xmath324 discussed before eq([vdiag ] ) , these @xmath1 symmetry breaking electronic terms , such as @xmath325 will generate under rg the operator @xmath98 .      impurities with a @xmath10-doublet ground state tunnelling around a point in the lattice with higher symmetry , such as octahedral symmetry in a cubic lattice , will clearly not have any relevant operators at the 2ck fixed point .",
    "the reason is that since these relevant operators are not allowed by @xmath1 , a subgroup of the octahedral group @xmath326 , they will not be allowed by @xmath326 either .",
    "however , there will be extra irrelevant operators , which turn out also to have dimension 3/2 , therefore not essentially changing the low temperature physics of the 2ck fixed point .",
    "electrons from representations @xmath327 such that @xmath328 contains the trivial representation , will also have an associated dimension 3/2 operator of the form of eq([irrelop2 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath329 and @xmath330 contain , apart from @xmath7 , also the doublet @xmath10 , electrons in these representations can couple orbitally with the impurity , in the form @xmath331 , for @xmath332 , giving two additional dimension 3/2 operators . as a result , in the case of octahedral symmetry @xmath326 , where there are two 3-dimensional representations of electrons , @xmath333 and @xmath334",
    ", there will be _ four _ extra dimension 3/2 operators , leading to a total of eight leading irrelevant operators .    if the impurity is in a _",
    "triplet _ ground state ( @xmath333 or @xmath334 in the octahedral , or @xmath335 in the tetrahedral case ) , due to arguments similar to those in this paper , it is anticipated that there will be a stable non - fermi - liquid fixed point , analogous to , but different from , the 2ck fixed point for an impurity @xmath10-doublet ground state .",
    "in this case the situation is similar to the critical point of the doublet case at which @xmath47 changes sign , corresponding roughly to a triplet impurity ground state;@xcite this is briefly discussed in the next section .",
    "for all of the physics discussed so far , the sign of @xmath47 is crucial . here",
    "we consider what happens if @xmath47 can be made to change sign by a change in the system , for example by applying pressure . from the analysis of section [ sec : ivc3v ]",
    ", it should be clear that it is really the sign of the effective hopping , @xmath155 , which includes renormalizations due to the effects of the electron assisted tunnelling , etc .",
    ", that is important . generally there will be a critical manifold separating the novel 2ck low temperature behavior from a conventional fermi liquid regime in which the impurity is in its non - degenerate symmetric state with simply potential scattering of the electrons .",
    "this is schematically shown in fig.[fig : fixedpoints ] .",
    "since both the fixed points are stable at zero temperature , the critical manifold separating their domains of attraction can generically be crossed by a one parameter change in the system .    when the system lies on the critical manifold , which corresponds to @xmath336 at small coupling , it will presumably flow to a new unstable fixed point .",
    "we conjecture that , apart from the charge-@xmath294 and spin-@xmath20 symmetries , this has an additional orbital-@xmath3 symmetry , where the @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath33 triplet is identified with the fundamental representation of @xmath3 .",
    "the behavior of the system on the critical manifold and close to this fixed point will be analyzed elsewhere,@xcite but below we quote some of the important results",
    ".    within the critical manifold this fixed point is stable and the rg flows close to the fixed point are determined from the dimension of the leading irrelevant operator , which in this case is 7/5 .",
    "therefore the impurity corrections to the specific heat , resistivity and susceptibility at low temperatures are @xmath337 , @xmath338 and @xmath339 , respectively . note that although the leading irrelevant operator and the symmetry of this fixed point are the same as those of the three - channel kondo model,@xcite the fixed point itself and the operator content are not the same .",
    "this can easily be seen by noting that while in the three - channel kondo model an impurity @xmath20-doublet couples to 3 channels of electrons through their spin , in this case the impurity is an @xmath3-triplet coupling to 2 channels of electrons through their orbital @xmath3 index .",
    "= 4truein    deviations away from the critical manifold are relevant dimension 3/5 . in a @xmath1 symmetric situation",
    "only one such operator exists , which can be represented by @xmath340 .",
    "this is therefore analogous to @xmath47 and it governs the rg flows away from the critical fixed point toward the fermi - liquid and the 2ck stable fixed points .",
    "therefore , tuning only one parameter ( such as external pressure ) the novel non - fermi - liquid fixed point associated with this higher orbital symmetry might be observed . in particular , close to the critical pressure , there will be a low temperature regime with the critical behavior crossing over below a temperature @xmath341 to one of the two possible low temperature behaviors .",
    "it should be noted that the above behavior also holds for the case of spinless impurities with a _ triplet _ degenerate ground state in tetrahedral or octahedral sites in a cubic crystal . in that case",
    "there will be no unstable directions close to the fixed point in the absence of symmetry breaking terms , just as for the 2ck fixed point in the case of @xmath1 , and the low temperature physics would be governed by the critical fixed point and its corresponding non - fermi - liquid behavior .",
    "we finally discuss briefly the possible relevance of impurity tunnelling to the nanoconstriction experiments of ralph and buhrman,@xcite as well as potential future experiments .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we showed that the interpretation of the observed non - fermi - liquid - like behavior of these experiments as a defect tunnelling between two sites@xcite runs into trouble due to the existence of _ two _ relevant operators , that drive the system away from the 2ck fixed point and therefore make it highly improbable that a typical impurity could lie close enough to the critical manifold for the non - fermi - liquid behavior to be observable .",
    "another possible interpretation is in terms of an interstitial , vacancy or other impurity in the copper lattice structure which has a @xmath10-degeneracy .",
    "in such a situation , the relevant perturbations would only be induced by strains or other such effects ; these tend to split the doublet , as discussed above .    in the copper nanoconstriction experiments@xcite the apparent kondo temperatures are quite large , approximately @xmath342 .",
    "this suggests that the impurity - electron interactions are appreciable and thus the kondo temperature , within our model , would be the energy scale at which @xmath47 becomes large .",
    "[ as seen in section [ sec : ivc3v ] , the rg eigenvalue of @xmath47 should be less than one .",
    "however , for not too large @xmath71 and @xmath72 a lower bound for @xmath47 is @xmath167 .",
    "] such a fast tunnelling rate suggests that a hopping process might involve either the slight rearrangement of several atoms , as this can have a lower effective mass , or a small displacement of an impurity ( or impurity complex ) from its central symmetric position .",
    "in the copper nanoconstriction devices@xcite no significant deviation from the @xmath343 temperature dependence of the impurity conductance signal has been seen down to @xmath344 , the lowest temperature studied . from eq([tm ] ) one can therefore estimate that the splitting energy scale @xmath102 would have to be less than @xmath345 , i.e. less than @xmath346 .",
    "in more recent experiments in @xmath347 and @xmath348@xcite a larger crossover temperature of about @xmath349 was observed , which would correspond to @xmath350 , which is about @xmath351 .",
    "the stronger splitting in these materials might be attributed to the fact that the nanoconstrictions are more stressed than the corresponding copper devices@xcite .    in order to see whether a scenario involving impurities with triangular symmetry might be reasonable",
    ", we need a rough estimate of the magnitude of the effects of strain . to be concrete ,",
    "we assume a jahn - teller potential , which in polar coordinates about the center of the triangle has the form @xmath352 with @xmath353 the strain tensor and @xmath354 and @xmath355 respectively the linear and quadratic splittings due to the jahn - teller effect .",
    "[ note that the potential for a jahn - teller impurity with cubic symmetry that has a doubly degenerate ground state would have a similar form to eq([vjt ] ) . in this case",
    "@xmath356 would be a tensor quantity , _ even _ under inversion , that parameterizes the deviations of atoms close to the impurity from their equilibrium positions . ]",
    "if @xmath357 is measured in units of the lattice constant , @xmath358 , then @xmath307 , @xmath359 , @xmath360 and the third rank tensor @xmath361 are all of order elastic energies @xmath362 . in the absence of strain",
    ", there will be three minimum energy positions of the impurity with , for @xmath354 and @xmath363 small , @xmath364 .",
    "these will be separated by barriers of order @xmath365 , with comparable contributions arising from both the second and fifth terms in eq([vjt ] ) .",
    "the tunnelling rate will be @xmath366 with @xmath367 the debye frequency and @xmath33 the tunnelling action .",
    "thus for @xmath47 to be about @xmath368 , the action @xmath33 can not be very large .",
    "the dominant effects of strain arise in two ways : first , the tunnelling rates between the three sites can become asymmetric . since some of the barriers will be changed by of order @xmath369 from eq([vjt ] ) , we see that the effective @xmath98 resulting from this will be @xmath370 which decreases with @xmath371 .",
    "in contrast , the direct splitting from the change in energy of the minima is @xmath372 which grows with @xmath371 . for both of these to be less than @xmath373 , one would need @xmath374  and @xmath375 .",
    "so small a strain appears implausible in a nanoconstriction . thus , unless an impurity configuration with anomalously weak coupling to strain or with other special properties were to exist , this explanation for the experiments of ralph _ et al_@xcite seems unlikely .",
    "other possible interpretations exist , in particular , a possible explanation of the data was proposed by wingreen _",
    "et al_@xcite that involves the existence of static randomness in the neighborhood of the constriction .",
    "but overall , the interpretation of these experiments is controversial at this time .",
    "but impurity tunnelling about symmetric positions in metals might occur in other situations .",
    "for example , it has been known for some time@xcite that undersized impurities often form rather stable complexes with interstitials .",
    "these complexes , in @xmath376 lattices , form octahedral configurations .",
    "thermally activated hopping between equivalent configurations of these complexes has been experimentally demonstrated at low temperatures in the case of dilute @xmath377 alloys,@xcite which suggests that low barriers might exist , even though in this system the tunnelling rates are probably very low.@xcite    in conclusion , we have shown that an impurity in a metal tunnelling between positions with high symmetry  in particular , triangular symmetry ",
    "can lead to generic non - fermi - liquid behavior , which can be characterized by the two - channel kondo model .",
    "symmetry breaking perturbations were shown to be partially screened , thereby reducing their effects and widening the potential temperature range for observation of the novel 2ck behavior .",
    "in addition , we have shown that by tuning a single parameter , such as pressure , the impurity behavior can change to that of a conventional fermi liquid , but at the critical pressure the behavior would be controlled by a fixed point that is conjectured to have a higher @xmath3 orbital symmetry .",
    "a detailed analysis of the behavior on and close to this critical manifold will be discussed in a future publication.@xcite    we wish to thank anirvan sengupta , bert halperin , andreas ludwig , paul fendley , jan von delft and sharad ramanathan for useful discussions and frans spaepen for bringing references and to our attention .",
