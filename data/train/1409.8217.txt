    "quantum entanglement plays a major role in quantum computation and information theory , where it is a key resource enabling a vast variety of tasks , such as teleportation - based universal quantum computing @xcite or blind quantum computing @xcite , and where it is also a central component of the security analysis of quantum key distribution @xcite .",
    "more fundamentally , understanding quantum entanglement is at the heart of theoretical physics , with issues ranging from quantum non - locality and bell inequalities @xcite to novel perspectives on black holes theory @xcite .    a fundamental problem in the theory of quantum entanglement consists of classifying entangled states into different equivalence classes and studying the possibility ( or impossibility ) of transforming entangled states between each other @xcite . in the usual scenario ,",
    "one considers the interconversion between different sets of states that rely on local operations ( effected separately by each of the parties sharing the state ) supplemented with classical communication ( among the different parties sharing the state ) .",
    "these transformations , commonly denoted as locc , can not increase the entanglement between the parties whatever the entanglement monotone used to measure this entanglement .",
    "it is , however , crucial to go beyond that simple fact and be able to determine whether a given entangled state can be reached by applying a locc transformation onto another entangled state . a very successful approach to address this question in the case of bipartite",
    "pure entangled states in finite dimension has been developed based on the mathematical theory of majorization : the possibility to transform a pure bipartite state into another by a deterministic locc protocol is connected to a majorization relation between their corresponding vectors of schmidt coefficients @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we envisage the interconversion between states of the electromagnetic field , and move therefore to an infinite - dimensional fock space .",
    "we focus in particular on the set of gaussian states , which are of great significance in quantum optics and continuous - variable quantum information theory @xcite .",
    "these states are easy to produce and manipulate experimentally , and at the same time can be described mathematically by using the first two statistical moments of the quadrature operators in phase space .",
    "consequently , the set of gaussian states and accompanying gaussian transformations is particularly relevant for our analysis of entanglement transformations as they well describe a great amount of quantum optical experiments and can be efficiently modelled within the so - called symplectic formalism @xcite .",
    "the interconversion between gaussian states has been addressed in a few earlier works @xcite , but many problems remain unsolved .",
    "in particular , most works have focused on the entanglement transformations of gaussian states using gaussian processes only .",
    "notably , the work by giedke _",
    "@xcite provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the interconversion between pure gaussian states when restricting to gaussian local operations with classical communication ( denoted as glocc ) , which can be realized in practice by using standard optical components , such as beam splitters , squeezers , phase - shifters and homodyne detectors .",
    "the proof starts by exploiting the fact that any @xmath1 pure gaussian state , i.e. , any bipartite gaussian state with @xmath2 modes on each side , can be transformed by a gaussian local unitary into a tensor product of @xmath2 two - mode squeezed vacuum states @xcite , which is completely characterized by the vector of squeezing parameters @xmath3 conventionally sorted in decreasing order .",
    "then , the problem simplifies to the interconversion between tensor products of two - mode squeezed vacuum states .",
    "the authors proved that a pure gaussian state @xmath4 can be transformed into @xmath5 using a glocc if and only if @xmath6 , @xmath7 , or in a more compact notation @xmath8 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are respectively characterized by their decreasing - ordered squeezing vectors @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the question that we investigate in the present work is whether it is possible to achieve , using a non - gaussian locc , transformations between gaussian states that are otherwise inaccessible by a glocc , i.e. , do not satisfy condition ( [ eqgiedke ] ) .",
    "this possibility was briefly mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite with the example of a couple of gaussian states that could be connected via a locc but could not via a gaussian process alone . here",
    ", we extend on this idea and develop a systematic approach to explore the possible interconversion between gaussian states that are not accessible by glocc .",
    "we broaden the analysis by providing a sufficient condition for the existence of a locc transformation between pure bipartite @xmath11 gaussian states that generalizes condition ( [ eqgiedke ] ) , at the price of loosing its necessary character .",
    "to achieve this goal , we use the theory of majorization , which provides an ideal tool to investigate the conditions for interconverting pure bipartite states using locc transformations @xcite .",
    "specifically , a finite - dimensional bipartite pure state @xmath4 can be transformed via a deterministic locc into @xmath5 if and only if the vectors of eigenvalues @xmath12 and @xmath13 of their respective reduced states @xmath14 and @xmath15 satisfy a majorization relation , that is @xmath16 equivalently , the interconversion @xmath17 is possible if and only if there is a bistochastic matrix @xmath18 that maps @xmath13 onto @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath19 , as reviewed in the appendix",
    ". we will actually use this second condition in the present paper , as it is better appropriate to achieve our goal ( finding a matrix @xmath18 gives a sufficient condition for the existence of a locc transformation ) .",
    "the application of majorization theory in an infinite - dimensional fock space in order to explore the interconversion between relevant states in quantum optics is a fertile ground of investigation , with only a few known results as of today . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that the output states of an optical quantum - limited amplifier that is applied to fock states satisfy a ladder of majorization relations , while a similar behaviour was proven to hold in ref .",
    "@xcite for a pure lossy line ( a beam splitter with vacuum on the other input port ) .",
    "besides these majorization relations intrinsic to these generic two - mode gaussian operations ( two - mode squeezer and beam splitter ) , it was recently shown that the output state resulting from the vacuum state processed by any phase - insensitive gaussian bosonic channel majorizes the output state corresponding to another input state @xcite , extending on the proof of the gaussian minimum entropy conjecture @xcite .",
    "the results presented here follow this line and illustrate again the power of majorization theory in quantum optics and continuous - variable quantum information theory .",
    "the remaining of the manuscript is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we outline the main results , illustrated in the simplest case of pure gaussian states of @xmath20 modes . in section iii ,",
    "we give the proof of our main theorem , as well as its generalization to an arbitrary number of modes .",
    "finally , in section iv , we conclude and bring forward some open problems . in the appendix",
    ", we summarize the basics of majorization theory and its connection to entanglement theory .",
    "we first illustrate our results for the simplest interesting case , namely pure gaussian states of @xmath20 modes .",
    "indeed , the case of pure gaussian states of @xmath21 modes trivially reduces to the interconversion between two - mode squeezed vacuum states , @xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 being the squeezing parameter . an obvious consequence of condition ( [ eqgiedke ] ) is that @xmath25 can be transformed into @xmath26 with a glocc iff @xmath27 .",
    "if @xmath28 the transformation is possible in the opposite direction with a glocc , so non - gaussian transformations are useless both ways .",
    "the situation becomes more interesting as soon as 2 modes are considered on each side .",
    "since any pure gaussian state of @xmath20 modes can be mapped via gaussian local unitaries onto a pair of two - mode squeezed vacuum states @xcite , we can assume without loss of generality that alice and bob s state @xmath4 is already in its normal form @xmath29 , characterized by its ordered squeezing vector @xmath30 , with @xmath31 .",
    "we then study the conditions under which it can be transformed under a locc into another state @xmath32 with squeezing vector @xmath33 and @xmath34 .    as depicted in figure [ fig1 ] ,",
    "there are four different possibilities for the evolution of the squeezing vector s components when transforming @xmath4 into @xmath5 .    in case",
    "[ a ] , both squeezing parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 decrease , a transformation that is always achievable using a glocc according to condition .",
    "case [ b ] corresponds to the situation where both squeezing parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 increase .",
    "it is easy to infer that there can not exist a locc ( neither gaussian nor non - gaussian ) that permits such a transformation . indeed ,",
    "case [ b ] can be viewed as the reverse process of case [ a ] and condition ( [ eqgiedke ] ) permits a glocc in the reverse direction .",
    "hence , transformation [ b ] is forbidden as majorization is a one - way property . in the latter two cases ,",
    "the squeezing parameters follow different evolutions , i.e. , the two components of the vector @xmath37 have opposite signs . in case [ c ] , @xmath35 increases and @xmath36 decreases , while case [ d ] is the converse . since condition is necessary",
    ", it is never possible to transform @xmath4 into @xmath5 using a glocc in neither of these cases .",
    "however , as it turns out , it is nevertheless possible to find a non - gaussian locc that successfully achieves such a transformation when the condition of the following theorem holds :    let @xmath4 and @xmath5 be two @xmath20 pure gaussian states respectively characterized by their decreasingly ordered squeezing vectors @xmath30 and @xmath38 such that the two components of vector @xmath37 have opposite signs .",
    "then , @xmath4 can be transformed into @xmath5 using a non - gaussian locc if @xmath39 where @xmath40 follows the sign of @xmath41 .",
    "[ the plus sign corresponds to case [ c ] , while the minus sign corresponds to case [ d ] . ]",
    "[ mainresult ]        thus , theorem [ mainresult ] provides us with a sufficient ( but not necessary ) condition for the existence of a locc that transforms @xmath42 into @xmath32 .",
    "the usefulness of this result is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where we analyse the possibility of the conversion from the initial state @xmath4 to the final state @xmath5 for fixed values of the squeezing parameters of the initial state , @xmath43 ( 9.96  db ) and @xmath44 ( 7.66  db ) .",
    "these values correspond simply to a mean photon number of 2 and 1 , respectively , when tracing @xmath45 and @xmath46 over bob s mode .",
    "each possible final state with squeezing parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 is associated with a point of coordinates @xmath49 in fig .",
    "thus , we can divide the plane in four quadrants corresponding to the four cases of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where the increasing - diagonal dashed line coincides with @xmath50 while the decreasing - diagonal dashed line corresponds to @xmath51 . the lower quadrant ( light green ) corresponds to case [ a ] , i.e. , transformations that are achievable with a glocc according to condition ( [ eqgiedke ] ) .",
    "the upper quadrant ( light blue ) corresponds to case [ b ] , i.e. , transformations that can not be achieved with a locc since condition ( [ eqgiedke ] ) permits a glocc in the reverse direction .",
    "the right quadrant corresponds to case [ c ] , while the left quadrant corresponds to case [ d ] . in both left and right quadrants ,",
    "the transformations can not be achieved with a glocc as they do not satisfy condition ( [ eqgiedke ] ) , but might be achievable with a non - gaussian locc . indeed ,",
    "condition ( [ eqmain ] ) is satisfied in a whole region ( dark green ) above the lower quadrant , implying that a locc exists , which must necessarily be non - gaussian .",
    "symmetrically , condition ( [ eqmain ] ) is satisfied in the reverse direction @xmath52 in a whole region ( dark blue ) below the upper quadrant , which means that a locc ( be it non - gaussian ) exists in the reverse direction , hence the transformation @xmath53 is impossible with a locc .",
    "thus , the sufficient condition ( [ eqmain ] ) allows us to significantly enlarge the regions where a locc is proven to exist ( green area ) or not to exist ( blue area ) .",
    "this is the main outcome of theorem [ mainresult ] .",
    "now , the remaining zones in the left and right quadrants can be explored numerically .",
    "for each point , we check whether a majorization relation exists between the eigenvalues of the reduced states corresponding to @xmath4 and @xmath5 in either direction , or whether the states are incomparable .",
    "we find states ( marked as green points ) where majorization holds , so that a locc exists although it is not detected by condition ( [ eqmain ] ) , illustrating the fact that this condition is not necessary .",
    "similarly , we find states ( marked as blue points ) such that majorization holds in the opposite direction ( undetected by our condition ) , implying that a locc exists in that direction , hence the transformation @xmath53 is impossible with a locc . finally , we find states that are incomparable ( marked as red points ) , in which case no deterministic locc exists both ways .",
    "in general terms , we are interested in deterministic locc transformations from the pure gaussian state @xmath55 , shared between alice having @xmath2 modes and bob having @xmath2 modes , towards the pure gaussian state @xmath56 . using the normal form reduction @xcite , we can assume without loss of generality that both @xmath55 and @xmath56 are a tensor product of two - mode squeezed vacuum states characterized by their respective squeezing vectors @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "so , we seek a sufficient condition on the existence of transformation @xmath59 under a deterministic locc .",
    "as shown for example in @xcite , majorization theory and its connection to entanglement transformations can be adapted to infinite dimensions and the usual states of quantum optics , the only subtlety being that the matrix @xmath18 becomes an infinite column - stochastic matrix instead of a double - stochastic matrix ( this means that all columns must still sum to one , while the sum of elements in each row must only be @xmath60 ) .",
    "majorization theory implies that a pure state @xmath55 can be transformed into @xmath56 using a deterministic locc if and only if alice s reduced states @xmath61 $ ] and @xmath62 $ ] resulting from tracing over bob s modes of the corresponding pure states satisfy the majorization relation @xmath63 ( see appendix ) .",
    "using the normal form of states @xmath55 and @xmath56 , this majorization condition can be rewritten as @xmath64 where @xmath65 stands for a thermal state of mean photon number @xmath66 on the @xmath67-th mode .",
    "note that the mean number of photons @xmath66 of state @xmath65 is connected to the squeezing parameter @xmath68 of its parent pure state @xmath69 through the relation @xmath70 .",
    "equation ( [ major - tensor ] ) means that states @xmath71 and @xmath72 admit respective vectors of eigenvalues @xmath12 and @xmath13 that satisfy the majorization relation @xmath73 , which is strictly equivalent to the existence of an infinite column - stochastic matrix @xmath18 satisfying the relation @xmath19 , hence mapping state @xmath72 onto state @xmath71 .",
    "the technical novelty of our work consists in finding a systematic way of constructing such matrices @xmath18 for different ensembles of thermal states @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "once such a matrix @xmath18 is found , we know that it must be possible to transform @xmath72 into @xmath71 by using a random mixture of unitaries , i.e. , @xmath74 where the unitary @xmath75 acts upon @xmath2 modes ( on alice s side ) and is applied with probability @xmath76 .",
    "( the sum over @xmath77 could also be replaced by an integral over a continuous variable and @xmath76 would then be a probability density . ) at this point , it is tempting to use standard gaussian transformations that are well known to map thermal states onto thermal states .",
    "for instance , knowing that the mean number of photons of a thermal state is increased by applying a quantum - limited amplifier @xmath78 ( or decreased if we apply a pure - loss channel @xmath79 ) , one would be tempted to use @xmath78 in order to transform a thermal state of mean photon vector @xmath80 into output thermal states of mean photon vector @xmath81 with @xmath82 .",
    "unfortunately , this gaussian channel @xmath78 ( as well as @xmath79 ) can not be written as a mixture of unitaries , so it can not directly be used for our purposes .    however , the key observation is that the action of some specific tensor products of quantum - limited amplifiers @xmath78 and pure - loss channels @xmath79 on the eigenvectors of some specific tensor products of thermal states is equivalent to the action of a column - stochastic matrix @xmath18 , i.e. , @xmath19 .",
    "this means that there must exist a mixture of ( maybe non - gaussian ) unitaries having the same effect as the chosen tensor product of gaussian channels when transforming the tensor product of thermal states @xmath72 into the tensor product of thermal states @xmath71 .",
    "this implies the existence of a ( maybe non - gaussian ) locc transformation that connects the gaussian pure states @xmath83 .",
    "below , in subsection a , we describe our approach in the simplest case of @xmath0 modes in the scenario [ a ] , where the mean photon number of the two thermal states decreases ( or equivalently both squeezing parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 decrease ) , recovering the existence condition for a glocc as in @xcite . in subsection b ,",
    "we generalize the method to give a sufficient condition for the existence of a locc transformation in cases [ c ] and [ d ] , where no glocc transformations are known to exist , which leads to the proof of theorem [ mainresult ] . in subsection c ,",
    "the method is generalized to an arbitrary number of modes .      as pictured in fig .",
    "[ 3a ] , the action of a quantum - limited amplifier @xmath78 on an input state @xmath15 is equivalent to the unitary interaction between the input mode @xmath84 and an environmental mode @xmath85 initially prepared in the vacuum state @xmath86 @xmath87,\\ ] ] where @xmath88 $ ] is a two - mode squeezing unitary .",
    "when we apply the quantum - limited amplifier to a single - mode phase - invariant state @xmath89 ( where @xmath90 is a fock state ) , the output state @xmath14 is also a phase - invariant state , therefore it is also diagonal in the fock basis , i.e. , @xmath91 . the corresponding vectors of eigenvalues @xmath13 and @xmath12 are related through the equation @xmath92 , where the matrix @xmath93 reads @xmath94 or in a compact form @xmath95 with @xmath96 and @xmath97 being the heaviside step function defined as @xmath98 for @xmath99 and @xmath100 for @xmath101 . here , @xmath102 is the column index ( @xmath103 is the number of input photons ) , @xmath104 is the row index ( @xmath105 is the number of output photons ) , so that @xmath106 is the number of photons created by parametric amplification .",
    "an important feature of this transformation @xmath78 is that it gives a column - stochastic matrix @xmath93 in fock basis . to prove this , notice that the sum of the elements of the @xmath102-th column of @xmath93 is given by @xmath107 using the pascal identity",

    "this implies that there exists a set of random unitaries that maps @xmath15 to @xmath14 and behaves exactly the same way as the quantum - limited amplifier @xmath78 on fock - diagonal input states ( in particular , on a thermal state @xmath118 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the bipartite @xmath119 pure state @xmath4 can be transformed into @xmath5 by using a deterministic locc , see fig .",
    "[ 3a ] . more generally , since the tensor product of column - stochastic matrices is itself column - stochastic , if each mode of @xmath71 is the output of a quantum - limited amplifier applied to the corresponding mode of @xmath72 initially prepared in a thermal state , we have found a column - stochastic matrix which maps the vector of eigenvalues of @xmath72 to that of @xmath71 .",
    "this implies that there exists a set of random unitaries that maps @xmath72 to @xmath71 , hence the bipartite @xmath54 pure state @xmath4 can be transformed into @xmath5 by using a deterministic locc .",
    "this reasoning provides a sufficient condition for the existence of a deterministic locc protocol in case [ a ] of figure [ fig1 ] , where both squeezing parameters increase . as a corollary",
    ", it also implies the non - existence of a locc in the reverse case [ b ] .",
    "thus , our approach gives an alternative proof to ref .",
    "@xcite for the existence ( non - existence ) of a locc in case [ a ] ( [ b ] ) .",
    "the locc achieving such a transformation in case [ a ] is rather simple : alice combines each mode with vacuum into a beamsplitter of transmissivity @xmath120 followed by an heterodyne detection on the environmental output port , then alice and bob apply displacement operations conditioned on the outcome of the heterodyne measurement ( see supplemental material of @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the entanglement transformation is achieved by a gaussian locc , in accordance with condition ( [ eqgiedke ] ) .      in order to study cases [ c ] and [ d ] , which are not covered by condition",

    "s necessary and sufficient criterion for the existence of a glocc relating such pure gaussian states @xcite ( while loosing the necessary character of the condition , meaning that a locc transformation may exist that is not detected by our criterion ) . in particular , our criterion guaranties the existence of a non - gaussian locc connecting some pure gaussian states that can not be connected otherwise with a glocc according to ref . @xcite . in other words ,",
    "we exhibit situations where pure gaussian state interconversions can be achieved with non - gaussian local operations even though gaussian local operations alone can not .",
    "this is reminiscent of situations where a gaussian no - go theorem precludes the use of gaussian resources in order to achieve a task involving gaussian states , e.g. quantum entanglement distillation @xcite , quantum error correction @xcite , or quantum bit commitment @xcite .",
    "our approach relies on majorization theory ( extended to infinite - dimensional spaces ) and consists in building explicit column - stochastic matrices @xmath174 that map the state @xmath15 ( whose purification is @xmath5 ) onto the state @xmath14 ( whose purification is @xmath4 ) , hence ensuring that the transformation @xmath149 is possible under a locc ( even if a glocc may not suffice ) .",
    "we build our column - stochastic matrices @xmath174 by using ( tensor products of ) gaussian channels ( namely , @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) applied to fock - diagonal states .",
    "thus , ironically , our approach allows us to infer the existence of non - gaussian locc transformations without leaving the simple mathematical tools developed for gaussian channels .",
    "unfortunately , working with an infinite - dimensional space makes it highly non - trivial to find the actual set of random unitaries mapping @xmath15 to @xmath14 and thus to design the corresponding locc protocol , even while @xmath18 is known .",
    "hence , the tools developed for finite - dimensional spaces can not be easily applied in the quantum optical scenario considered here .",
    "we leave this subject for further investigation .    to simplify our presentation , we have restricted our numerical analysis to the @xmath20 case ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "a thorough analysis of the entanglement transformations between @xmath54 states would be worthwhile , but we already observe interesting behaviors in the @xmath20 case ( situations where gloccs are precluded by @xcite while loccs are sufficient according to theorem [ mainresult ] ) . even in the @xmath20 case ,",
    "a problem left open here is that of designing the specific non - gaussian locc realizing the transformation that is predicted to exist .",
    "interestingly , the situation considered in case [ c ] of figure [ fig1 ] can be seen as a way of concentrating the entanglement of two two - mode squeezed vacuum states into a single two - mode squeezed vacuum state ( the other one loosing its entanglement ) .",
    "therefore , progress on designing such locc protocols could open a way to novel protocols enhancing the entanglement of gaussian states through non - gaussian operations .",

    "majorization is an algebraic theory which provides a mean to compare two probability distributions in terms of disorder or randomness @xcite .",
    "let @xmath175 and @xmath176 be two probability distribution vectors of dimension @xmath104 . if @xmath177 and @xmath178 are vectors containing the elements of @xmath175 and @xmath176 sorted in non - increasing order , @xmath175 majorizes @xmath176 , i.e @xmath179 , iff @xmath180 with equality when @xmath181 . in this case",
    ", one says that @xmath176 is more disordered than @xmath175 .",
    "note that if @xmath175 and @xmath176 are probability distributions , the equality for @xmath181 is always satisfied .",
    "majorization only provides a pre - order , in the sense that if @xmath182 , this does nt necessarily mean that @xmath183 .",
    "when both @xmath182 and @xmath184 are satisfied , @xmath175 and @xmath176 are said to be incomparable .    in order to understand why majorization allows one to compare probability distributions in terms of disorder ,",
    "let us introduce an alternative way of detecting majorization .",
    "a more intuitive definition is to say that @xmath175 majorizes @xmath176 iff there exists a set of @xmath104-dimensional permutation matrices @xmath185 and a probability distribution @xmath186 such that @xmath187 this last equation clearly show the relation between disorder and majorization .",
    "indeed , we see that if @xmath175 majorizes @xmath176 , then @xmath176 can be obtained by applying random permutations to @xmath175 , making the latter more disordered .",
    "this definition also allows us to introduce another equivalent way of characterizing majorization in terms of doubly - stochastic matrices .",
    "these are the matrices whose columns and rows sum to @xmath143 .",
    "the set of doubly - stochastic matrices of a given dimension is convex , and its extremal points are given by permutation matrices of the same dimension .",
    "consequently , any doubly stochastic matrix can be decomposed as a convex combination of permutation matrices .",
    "this allows us to introduce the following theorem .",
    "this theory of majorization beautifully extends to the quantum realm .",
    "indeed , one can compare density matrices by simply comparing their vectors of eigenvalues , whose elements are probability distributions .",
    "thus , given two density matrices @xmath14 and @xmath118 whose vectors of eigenvalues are respectively given by vectors @xmath190 and @xmath191 , one says that @xmath192 if @xmath193 .",
    "we then naturally have the following theorem @xcite .",
    "@xmath192 iff state @xmath118 can be obtained from state @xmath14 by applying a random mixture of unitaries , i.e @xmath194 where @xmath195 is a probability distribution and the @xmath196 are unitaries for all @xmath67 .",
    "a very interesting connection between quantum information theory and majorization resides in the fact that one can use the latter in order to compare pure bipartite entangled state , or more precisely to investigate the possibility to transform a state into another using a locc .",
    "suppose alice and bob share a pure state @xmath4 and want to transform it into a state @xmath197 .",
    "the following theorem investigates such a possibility @xcite :      the theory of majorization nicely adapts to the infinite dimensional case , allowing one to compare gaussian states in particular .",
    "the definitions we stated before stay the same , the only difference residing in the doubly stochastic matrix , which should now be replaced by an infinite dimensional column stochastic matrix , whose columns still sum to @xmath143 , but whose rows sum to a value less or equal than @xmath143 @xcite . note that in the case of gaussian states , it is difficult to use definition , due to the complexity of the problem of ordering the eigenvalues of a multi - mode gaussian state . verifying that theorem [ majo2 ] holds seems an easier task , which is the technique used in our work .",
    "unfortunately , there is not easy algorithm to decide whether a column - stochastic matrix exists that connects the eigenvalues of two infinite sets ( and that generates the matrix in case it exists ) .",
    "therefore , heuristic approaches , such as the one developed in our work , are needed . in this paper",
    ", we provide a way to find such a family of column - stochastic matrices , allowing us to use the theory of majorization to compare gaussian multi - mode states ."
