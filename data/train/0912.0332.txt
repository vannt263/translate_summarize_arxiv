    "to obtain the dark matter distribution at large scale around galaxies , much farther than the extent of rotation curves , astronomers have since a long time used the kinematics of satellite galaxies ( erickson et al 1987 , zaritsky et al 1993 , 1994 , 1997 ) . because the number of satellites per galaxy is very small , the technique consists in stacking the data on many galaxy - satellite pairs , in common bins of host luminosity . in the 1990s ,",
    "the number of satellites were counted in hundreds , and the statistics were not sufficient to provide significant results .",
    "for instance with 115 satellites at distances lower than 500kpc , the probability to find nsat satellites was fitted to p(nsat ) = 0.4@xmath1 ( zaritsky et al 1997 ) .",
    "no dependence of velocity dispersion of the satellites with radius , nor with the host mass , was found .",
    "the advent of rich surveys such as the sdss and 2df grs have given more statistical value to the satellite studies , including now nsat = a few thousands ( mckay et al 2002 , brainerd & specian 2003 , prada et al 2003 , van den bosch et al 2004 ) .",
    "while some studies still find a velocity dispersion @xmath2 flat with radius , most of them now see the decrease of @xmath2 with radius , and the increase with the host luminosity or mass . however , there are still contradictory results , as reviewed by norberg et al ( 2008 ) .",
    "they found that the velocity dispersion within a projected radius of 175@xmath3kpc is increasing as the square root of luminosity for ellipticals , implying a constant m / l ratio with mass .",
    "for spirals the slope is higher , @xmath4 and the mass - to - light ratio is increasing with luminosity .",
    "m / l is 3 - 10 times higher for ellipticals than for spirals , at the same luminosity l@xmath5 . for the milky way luminosity bin , m(175@xmath3kpc)= @xmath6 , but there is a large scatter , for a given l.      one of the main problem of the method is the stacking of satellites in host luminosity bins , to recover sufficient statistics . in each l bin , there is a significant scatter in halo mass , which prevents to derive a unique halo mass - luminosity relation ( more et al 2009a ) . to help raise the degeneracy , it is useful to compute the velocity dispersion by different weighting methods : the satellite weighted dispersion : @xmath7 , ( where the sum is over the @xmath8 central galaxies , identified by their @xmath9 number , who have each @xmath10 satellites ) , is biased towards higher values than the host weighted one : @xmath11 , and the scatter increases with luminosity ( more et al 2009b ) .",
    "one other caveat is to discriminate against interlopers , the fraction of which depends on the host selection criteria ; the interlopers fraction has been estimated from 10% for extremely isolated hosts ( prada et al 2003 ) , to 30% or more , in mock catalogs ( van den bosch et al 2004 ) .",
    "the difficulty is that interlopers are not uniformly distributed on the sky , but are also clustered ( e.g. chen et al 2006 ) .      with the help of the mock simulations to interpret the data ,",
    "a quiterobust result is that halo mass to luminosity",
    "m / l decreases with l , and more specifically , the dispersion - luminosity relation depends on the radius it is estimated : @xmath12 at 120kpc and @xmath13 at 350kpc ( prada et al 2003 ) .",
    "it is interesting to compare the results with those obtained through weak lensing ( hoekstra et al 2002 ) .",
    "the slope of the dispersion - luminosity relation is very close to the tully - fisher slope 1/4 for spiral galaxies ( verheijen 2001 ) , and can be called a tully - fisher equivalent .",
    "recently , klypin & prada ( 2009 ) have carried out a further satellite study from the sdss , selecting as hosts only red isolated galaxies , expected to be ellipticals or spheroids .",
    "since the hosts are very isolated , there are only 1 or 0 satellite for each galaxy .",
    "they compute the radial distribution of velocity dispersion , in three host luminosity bins , and find constraints on dark matter models ( @xmath0cdm or modified gravity mond ) , while fitting both the dispersion @xmath2 , and the radial density law of the satellites .",
    "they claim that mond can not account for the observations .",
    "the fits however have to include many free parameters , related to the velocity anisotropy of satellites , and therefore contain significant degeneracy .",
    "the situation is quite similar to the velocity dispersion studies at smaller scales around elliptical galaxies .",
    "the drop of @xmath2 derived from planetary nebulae was first interpreted as a possible dearth of dark matter ( romanowsky et al 2003 ) , while fits including a radially variable anisotropy of velocities @xmath14 reconciled the data with the cdm model ( dekel et al 2005 ) .",
    "@xmath14 can vary between -@xmath15 ( purely tangential orbits ) , to 1 ( purely radial orbits ) , passing through 0 ( isotropy ) , and this is justified through galaxy mergers , since ellipticals are assumed to be the result of major mergers , or a succession of minor mergers .",
    "we used the satellite kinematics data from klypin & prada ( 2009 ) to test the predictions of mond at large - scale around isolated galaxies .",
    "it has been shown that when the anisotropy parameter radial variation is properly taken into account , mond gives a good fit of the data ( angus et al 2007 , tiret et al 2007 ) .",
    "we also combined around a typical well - studied early - type galaxy ngc 3379 the various fits of velocity dispersion at three different scales : small - scale with stellar tracers , intermediate scale with planetary nebulae , and large - scale with satellites ( in the corresponding luminosity bin ) .",
    "both cdm and mond models provide satisfying fits ( although cdm cores have to be assumed in the center , tiret et al 2007 ) .",
    "the anisotropy is comparable to what is expected in cosmological simulations ( sales et al 2007 ) .",
    "we present in figure 1 more fits , corresponding to different mass and luminosity intervals , not available before , together with the radial distribution of tracer density and velocity anisotropy .",
    "for all these fits , a constant stellar mass to light ratio of @xmath16=4 has been adopted , corresponding to realistic populations for the red galaxies involved .",
    "note that given the tully - fisher equivalent relation observed , i.e. @xmath17 , the fit can easily be generalised for a wide range of mass , since these outside regions are in the mond regime , where @xmath18 ( milgrom 1983 ) .",
    "these fits are for isolated galaxies .",
    "we might expect problems in groups and clusters , when large masses exist nearby .",
    "they produce then an external field effect ( efe ) , that reduce the dark matter equivalent of mond ( although the efe has been successfully fitted in the milky way , wu et al 2007 ) . at even larger scales ,",
    "the dark halo mass - to - luminosity depends on environment , and for groups on the crossing time .",
    "small and large haloes have the largest m / l , while intermediate haloes , small groups with late - type galaxies have the lowest m / l of @xmath1990 ( tully 2005 ) .",
    "the method of satellite kinematics is giving now more robust results , with the increased statistics of big surveys ( sdss , 2df ) .",
    "however , still very different results can be found in the literature , according to the selection of primaries ( isolation criterium ) , and the elimination of interlopers .",
    "the mass and radial dependence of @xmath20 is now derived , but with large uncertainties , due essentially to stacking problems , the mass being widely scattered in a given luminosity bin .",
    "the modelisation involves numerous degrees of freedom , in the radial distribution of the velocity anistropy , essentially .",
    "the shape of @xmath20 versus distance can be fit with appropriate @xmath14 both in @xmath0cdm and mond .",
    "the generalisation to a large range of masses , is automatic if the tully - fisher equivalent relation is satisfied @xmath17 .",
