    "in this paper we consider the applications of a new numerical - analytical technique based on the methods of local nonlinear harmonic analysis or wavelet analysis to nonlinear rms envelope dynamics problems which can be characterized by collective type behaviour [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .",
    "such approach may be useful in all models in which it is possible and reasonable to reduce all complicated problems related with statistical distributions to the problems described by systems of nonlinear ordinary / partial differential equations with or without some ( functional ) constraints .",
    "wavelet analysis is a set of mathematical methods , which gives the possibility to work with well - localized bases in functional spaces and gives the maximum sparse forms for the general type of operators ( differential , integral , pseudodifferential ) in such bases .",
    "our approach is based on the variational - wavelet approach from [ 3]-[14 ] , that allows to consider rational type of nonlinearities in rms dynamical equations .",
    "the solution has the multiscale / multiresolution decomposition via nonlinear high - localized eigenmodes , which corresponds to the full multiresolution expansion in all underlying time / space scales .",
    "we may move from coarse scales of resolution to the finest one for obtaining more detailed information about our dynamical process . in this way we give contribution to our full solution from each scale of resolution or each time / space scale or from each nonlinear eigenmode .",
    "the same is correct for the contribution to power spectral density ( energy spectrum ) : we can take into account contributions from each level / scale of resolution .",
    "starting in part 2 from general rms envelope dynamics model we consider in part 3 the approach based on variational - wavelet formulation .",
    "we give explicit representation for all dynamical variables in the base of compactly supported wavelets or nonlinear eigenmodes .",
    "our solutions are parametrized by the solutions of a number of reduced algebraical problems one from which is nonlinear with the same degree of nonlinearity and the others are the linear problems depend on particular wavelet type approach .",
    "in part 4 we consider numerical modelling based on our analytical approach .",
    "we consider an approach based on the second moments of the distribution functions for the calculation of evolution of rms envelope of a beam .",
    "the rms envelope equations are the most useful for analysis of the beam self  forces ( space  charge ) effects and also allow to consider both transverse and longitudinal dynamics of space - charge - dominated relativistic high  brightness axisymmetric / asymmetric beams , which under short laser pulse  driven radio - frequency photoinjectors have fast transition from nonrelativistic to relativistic regime [ 1 ] .",
    "the analysis of halo growth in beams , appeared as result of bunch oscillations in the particle - core model , is also based on three - dimensional envelope equations [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .",
    "let @xmath0 be the distribution function , which gives full information about noninteracting ensemble of beam particles regarding to trace space or transverse phase coordinates @xmath1 .",
    "then we may extract the first nontrivial effects of collective dynamics from the second moments @xmath2 rms emittances are given by @xmath3 we consider the following most general case of rms envelope equations , which describe evolution of the moments in the model of halo formation by bunch oscillations ( ref . [",
    "2 ] for full designation ) : @xmath4 where @xmath5 are bunch envelopes , @xmath6 , @xmath7 . after transformations",
    "to cauchy form we can see that all these equations from the formal point of view are not more than ordinary differential equations with rational nonlinearities and variable coefficients .",
    "also , we consider regimes in which we are interested in constraints on emittances : @xmath8 where @xmath9 are constants . in the same way according to [ 2 ] we may consider the case of energy - type functional - differential constraints on emittances .",
    "a different approach is considered in our related paper in this proceedings [ 15 ] .",
    "our problems above may be formulated as the systems of ordinary differential equations @xmath10 with initial ( or boundary ) conditions @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are not more than polynomial functions of dynamical variables @xmath14 and have arbitrary dependence on time / length parameter . of course , we consider such @xmath15 which do not lead to the singular problem with @xmath15 , when @xmath16 or @xmath17 , i.e. @xmath18 , 0 .",
    "we ll consider these equations as the following operator equation .",
    "let @xmath19 be an arbitrary nonlinear ( rational ) matrix differential operator of the first order with matrix dimension d ( d=6 in our case ) corresponding to the system of equations ( 5 ) , which acts on some set of functions @xmath20 from @xmath21 : @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "let us consider now the n mode approximation for solution as the following ansatz ( in the same way we may consider different ansatzes ) : @xmath24 we shall determine the coefficients of expansion from the following variational conditions ( different related variational approaches are considered in [ 3]-[14 ] ) : @xmath25 we have exactly @xmath26 algebraical equations for @xmath26 unknowns @xmath27 .",
    "so , variational approach reduced the initial problem ( 5 ) or ( 6 ) to the problem of solution of functional equations at the first stage and some algebraical problems at the second stage . here @xmath28 are useful basis functions of some functional space ( @xmath29 , sobolev , etc ) corresponding to concrete problem . as result",
    "we have the following reduced algebraical system of equations ( rsae ) on the set of unknown coefficients @xmath30 of expansions ( 7 ) : @xmath31 where operators l and m are algebraization of rhs and lhs of initial problem ( [ eq : pol0 ] ) .",
    "@xmath32 are the coefficients ( with possible time dependence ) of lhs of initial system of differential equations ( [ eq : pol0 ] ) and as consequence are coefficients of rsae .",
    "@xmath33 are the coefficients ( with possible time dependence ) of rhs of initial system of differential equations ( [ eq : pol0 ] ) and as consequence are the coefficients of rsae .",
    "@xmath34 , @xmath35 are multiindexes , by which are labelled @xmath36 and @xmath37 , the other coefficients of rsae ( [ eq : pol2 ] ) : @xmath38 where p is the degree of polynomial operator p ( [ eq : pol0 ] ) @xmath39 where q is the degree of polynomial operator q ( [ eq : pol0 ] ) , @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "according to [ 3]-[14 ] we may extend our approach to the case when we have additional constraints ( 4 ) on the set of our dynamical variables @xmath42 or @xmath43 . in this case by using the method of lagrangian multipliers we again may apply the same approach but for the extended set of variables . as result",
    "we receive the expanded system of algebraical equations analogous to the system ( 9 ) .",
    "then , after reduction we again can extract from its solution the coefficients of expansion ( 7 ) . now , when we solve rsae ( [ eq : pol2 ] ) and determine unknown coefficients from formal expansion ( 7 ) we therefore obtain the solution of our initial problem .",
    "it should be noted if we consider only truncated expansion ( 7 ) with n terms then we have from ( [ eq : pol2 ] ) the system of @xmath44 algebraical equations with degree @xmath45 and the degree of this algebraical system coincides with degree of initial differential system .",
    "so , we have the solution of the initial nonlinear ( rational ) problem in the form @xmath46 where coefficients @xmath47 are roots of the corresponding reduced algebraical ( polynomial ) problem rsae ( [ eq : pol2 ] ) .",
    "consequently , we have a parametrization of solution of initial problem by solution of reduced algebraical problem ( [ eq : pol2 ] ) .",
    "the problem of computations of coefficients @xmath36 ( [ eq : alpha ] ) , @xmath48 ( [ eq : beta ] ) of reduced algebraical system may be explicitly solved in wavelet approach .",
    "the obtained solutions are given in the form ( [ eq : pol3 ] ) , where @xmath28 are wavelet basis functions . in our case @xmath28",
    "are obtained via multiresolution expansions and represented by compactly supported wavelets . because affine group of translation and dilations is inside the approach , this method resembles the action of a microscope .",
    "we have contribution to final result from each scale of resolution from the whole infinite scale of spaces : @xmath49 where the closed subspace @xmath50 corresponds to level j of resolution , or to scale j. this multiresolution functional space decomposition corresponds to exact nonlinear eigenmode decompositions ( 12 ) .",
    "it should be noted that such representations give the best possible localization properties in the corresponding ( phase)space / time coordinates .",
    "in contrast with different approaches formulae ( 7 ) , ( 12 ) do not use perturbation technique or linearization procedures and represent dynamics via generalized nonlinear localized eigenmodes expansion .",
    "so , by using wavelet bases with their good ( phase)space / time localization properties we can construct high - localized ( coherent ) structures in spatially - extended stochastic systems with collective behaviour .",
    "@xmath51 section.,width=226 ]",
    "so , our n mode construction ( 7 ) , ( 12 ) gives the following representation for solution of rms equations ( 3 ) : @xmath52 where @xmath53 may be represented by some family of ( nonlinear ) eigenmodes and gives as a result the multiresolution / multiscale representation in the high - localized wavelet bases .",
    "the corresponding decomposition is presented on fig .  1 and two - dimensional transverse section @xmath54@xmath51 on fig .  2 .",
