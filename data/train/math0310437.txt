    "this paper addresses the problem of symplectic reduction for cotangent bundles with proper actions , at zero momentum . from the point of view of mechanics ,",
    "cotangent bundles are the most important symplectic manifolds since they are the phase spaces for most classical mechanical systems .",
    "the geometry of the reduced space plays a crucial role in understanding the dynamics of reduced hamiltonian systems with non - freely acting symmetry groups .",
    "we view this problem , then , as a fundamental one in the theory of geometric mechanics and symplectic reduction .",
    "a general theory of symplectic reduction for proper , and non - free actions has been a subject of active research since the original theory was worked out in marsden and weinstein @xcite and meyer @xcite .",
    "the geometric structure of the reduced spaces was first satisfactorily understood , for the case of compact symmetry groups , in the breakthrough paper of sjamaar and lerman @xcite , where the tools of stratification by orbit types were first introduced to precisely determine how the reduced space , which is not in general a manifold , is decomposed into symplectic manifolds called symplectic strata .",
    "indeed , from this point of view , they were able to put in geometric context the earlier work on this problem by proving that the symplectic strata of the reduced space are the symplectic leaves of the reduced poisson algebra as determined in arms et al .",
    "these symplectic strata are obtained by first intersecting the zero level set of the momentum map with the points in the original symplectic manifold with the same orbit type , and then taking the quotient of this space by the group action .",
    "they also explain how the strata fit together by examining the behavior of a linear symplectic action on a symplectic normal space , and applying the symplectic slice theorem due to marle , guillemin , and sternberg .",
    "since this work , the field has continued to develop substantially . in bates and lerman @xcite ,",
    "the theory was extended to proper group actions and nonzero momentum , by way of orbit reduction , with the assumption of locally closed coadjoint orbits . in ortega and ratiu",
    "@xcite , the theory of poisson reduction by a free poisson action given in marsden and ratiu @xcite , is extended to the singular case .",
    "the symplectic reduction theory is extended to the case of non - locally closed coadjoint orbits in cushman and niatycki @xcite by looking at accessible sets of invariant hamiltonian vector fields . a comprehensive reference for all these results , including several generalizations and improvements of the theory and also their consequences in terms of reduction and reconstruction of hamiltonian dynamics",
    "is found in ortega and ratiu @xcite .",
    "another text , cushman and bates @xcite , besides giving an overview of the general theory , contains also many computed examples using invariant theory .    specializing to cotangent bundles , one expects , as in the free case , that the reduced space will admit special structure .",
    "indeed , in the free case , as is well known , the reduced space at zero momentum is in fact simply the cotangent bundle of the orbit space of the base with its canonical symplectic form .",
    "at nonzero momentum it is known that the reduced symplectic space is symplectomorphic to a coadjoint orbit bundle ( see marsden and perlmutter @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively it can be seen as the image of a symplectic embedding into an appropriate cotangent bundle ( see for instance marsden @xcite ) .",
    "although various attempts were made to apply the general theory of singular reduction to understand the important case of cotangent bundles , until now , there has not been a complete picture without strong assumptions .",
    "the literature begins with a result due to montgomery @xcite prior to the work of sjamaar and lerman in which he extends the embedding theory of regular cotangent bundle reduction to the case where the involved groups satisfy a special dimension condition and the proper action on the base manifold is assumed to consist of only one orbit type . in the paper @xcite emmrich and rmer give a complete solution to the zero momentum reduced space for a proper action again with the assumption that the base action consists of just one orbit type . as one might guess from the free theory of cotangent bundle reduction and the fact that the orbit space for the base action is a manifold",
    ", they obtain that the reduced space at zero momentum is just the cotangent bundle of the orbit space with its canonical symplectic form .    the next paper to address the problem of reduction of cotangent bundles is lerman et al .",
    "@xcite , where the example of @xmath0 acting on @xmath1 is computed and the reduced space at zero momentum is shown to be the `` canoe '' .",
    "they also provide a result for singular cotangent bundle reduction at zero in the case that the action admits a cross section .",
    "finally , we note that in schmah @xcite , the results obtained in @xcite are again obtained with a different proof and extended , under the same hypothesis on the isotropy groups in the base , to deal with reduction at momentum values with trivial coadjoint orbits .",
    "[ [ the - main - results . ] ] the main results .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    there are several new results in this paper .",
    "an important guiding principle in this work is that zero momentum reduced data should correspond with data constructed from the group action on the base , in particular the isotropy lattice .",
    "we will consider a proper action of a lie group @xmath2 on a manifold @xmath3 and its lifted action on @xmath4 , which is hamiltonian with respect to the canonical symplectic form with equivariant momentum map @xmath5 .",
    "our first main result , theorem [ teo3 ] , is that the isotropy lattice for the @xmath2-action on the zero momentum level set , @xmath6 , is isomorphic to the isotropy lattice for the base action of @xmath2 on @xmath3 .",
    "we obtain this , roughly , by decomposing @xmath6 as a disjoint union of fiber bundles along the base orbit types and then using a subtle application of the tube theorem for slices .",
    "next , relative to this primary decomposition of @xmath6 , knowing its isotropy lattice , we consider for each isotropy type @xmath7 the set @xmath8 . call a pair of elements , @xmath9 in the isotropy lattice of @xmath3 a _ connectable pair _ over @xmath7 , provided @xmath10 .",
    "this means that @xmath11 is conjugate to a subgroup of @xmath12 .",
    "let us denote this relationship by @xmath13 .",
    "we are now able to obtain a decomposition of the manifold , @xmath8 , into fiber bundles , one for each connectable pair over @xmath7 .",
    "that is , to each group larger than or equal to @xmath7 in the base lattice we construct a fiber bundle , contained in @xmath8 .",
    "the symplectic strata of the reduced space @xmath14 are given by @xmath15 for each @xmath7 in the base isotropy lattice and we will further demonstrate that each of these is in turn stratified by fiber bundles , which we call seams , one for each connectable pair @xmath16 over @xmath7 .",
    "the pair @xmath17 is in fact identified under a natural diffeomorphism to the cotangent bundle @xmath18 and we will prove that this is an open dense piece in this _ secondary _ stratification of each symplectic stratum .",
    "the other pieces fiber over the strata in the boundary of @xmath19 .",
    "the reduced symplectic structure fits together with respect to this stratification in an elegant way .",
    "the cotangent bundle within each symplectic stratum is open and dense .",
    "we prove in proposition [ secondprop ] that the restriction of the reduced symplectic form to each seam is in fact equal to the pull back of the corresponding canonical symplectic form of the corresponding cotangent bundle . in theorem  [ secondsymp ]",
    "we characterize the reduced symplectic form on each symplectic stratum as the unique extension of the canonical symplectic form of the open and dense cotangent bundle ( corresponding to the @xmath17 connectable pair ) to its closure . furthermore , we prove in theorem  [ secondsymp ] that the seams ( corresponding to the @xmath16 pairs ) are in fact coisotropic submanifolds within their corresponding symplectic strata .",
    "we consider the topology of the total reduced space @xmath20 and obtain a _",
    "coisotropic _ stratification ( theorem [ coisotropicdecomposition ] ) which demonstrates that the full collection of objects , seams and cotangent bundles , corresponding to the entire set of connectable pairs in the isotropy lattice of the base , forms a stratification of @xmath20 , which is of second order in the sense that each of its strata is labelled by a connectable pair in the isotropy lattice .",
    "it is finer than the stratification induced by the symplectic strata of sjamaar and lerman and , in opposition to the latter , the continuous surjective projection to @xmath21 happens to be a morphism of stratified spaces with respect to the coisotropic stratification of @xmath20 and the orbit type stratification of @xmath21 .",
    "it should be noted that although the secondary and coisotropic stratifications introduced here are suitable for explaining the bundle structure of the reduced space for cotangent - lifted actions , they lose some of the good properties enjoyed by the symplectic stratification .",
    "first , the secondary and coisotropic stratifications are not known to have the conical property , or to satisfy the whitney conditions as the symplectic stratification ( see @xcite ) . for general symplectic manifolds ,",
    "this is possible due to the existence of the symplectic slice theorem , which is not well adapted to the cotangent bundle case .",
    "second , unlike for the symplectic stratification , the secondary pieces of the stratifications introduced here are not invariant under the reduced hamiltonian flows , which makes our results difficult to apply to dynamics",
    ". however , these results do give qualitative information about the evolution of isotropy in the projection of the reduced flows to the reduced base space @xmath21 .",
    "see the end of the paper for more remarks on these two comments .",
    "for most of the derivations of our results about these stratifications we will work in the slightly weaker category of @xmath22-decomposed spaces , because it is computationally simpler .",
    "this category is introduced in section 2 . in section  5 , however , we show how these results persist in the category of stratified spaces .",
    "the main aim of this section is to review the results on proper group actions and symplectic reduction that we shall need for the rest of the paper .",
    "this review will also serve to fix notation .",
    "we first review the basic results on proper group actions on manifolds , namely the decomposition of the manifold into orbit types which is a @xmath22-decomposition ( to be introduced later ) of the manifold .",
    "we then recall the general theory of symplectic reduction at zero momentum for proper group actions which describes the decomposition of the reduced space at zero into symplectic @xmath22-manifolds obtained in a natural way from the orbit type decomposition of @xmath23 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we will summarize the known results for cotangent bundle reduction , first in the free case , and then , the next easiest case for proper actions : the case with only one orbit type on the base manifold .",
    "recall that a smooth action of a lie group on a manifold @xmath3 is _ proper _ if the map @xmath24 , @xmath25 is proper ( the inverse image of a compact set is compact ) .",
    "notice that we have denoted the action map @xmath26 by a dot .",

    "but it is known that the partition of a vector space by orbit types with respect to the linear representation of a compact lie group is a decomposition ( see for instance lemma 4.10.12 of @xcite ) .",
    "consequently the induced @xmath22-decomposition of @xmath253 , consisting of the intersection of pieces in @xmath3 with @xmath253 is actually a decomposition since the pieces are of the form @xmath657 , having its connected components the same dimension .    to see that the coisotropic decomposition is a stratification , first recall that the map @xmath658 is an open , @xmath22-decomposed map",
    "now , choosing a suitable small enough open set , @xmath253 in @xmath20 , it will project to a decomposed open set , @xmath659 where all pieces have components of the same dimension , since @xmath21 is locally decomposed",
    ". a connected component of @xmath660 projects under @xmath565 to a connected component of @xmath661 , and its dimension is determined by the dimension of this component of @xmath661 and the dimension of some other connected component of @xmath662 as we have seen in the proof of theorem  [ secondsymp ] .",
    "since @xmath446 is a decomposed space then all these pieces of the form @xmath662 have the same dimension , from where it follows that all the connected components of @xmath660 have the same dimension , and therefore @xmath253 is a decomposed open set in @xmath20 , proving that the coisotropic decomposition is a stratification .",
    "similar arguments work for the secondary decomposition , and so we conclude theorem  [ theupgrade ] .",
    "we are therefore justified to use the terminology secondary and coisotropic stratifications , as well as their corresponding stratification lattices .",
    "we will illustrate the main results obtained in this paper with an example that is simple , yet rich enough to show the extra structure appearing in singular symplectic reduction for cotangent bundles . we will compute the secondary and coisotropic stratifications exhibiting explicitly the corresponding frontier conditions predicted in theorems [ thm8 ] and [ coisotropicdecomposition ] .",
    "consider the @xmath663 action on @xmath664 , where @xmath0 acts by rotations around the @xmath104-axis and @xmath105 by reflections with respect to the plane @xmath106 .",
    "the isotropy lattice and the decomposition lattice for this action are shown in figure  [ examples ] .",
    "let @xmath107 be equipped with the euclidean inner product which defines a @xmath2-invariant riemannian metric for this action .",
    "identifying @xmath665 with @xmath666 then the cotangent lifted action is diagonal , @xmath667 for @xmath273 and @xmath668 .",
    "let @xmath669 be the coordinates of the vector @xmath670 with respect to the canonical basis .",
    "the ring of @xmath2-invariant polynomials , @xmath671 , is generated by @xmath672 these polynomials are subject to the relations @xmath673 note that the relations between the @xmath674 s and the @xmath675 s are uncoupled if @xmath495 is zero .",
    "the momentum map for the cotangent lifted action of @xmath2 is @xmath676 .",
    "let now @xmath677 be a @xmath2-invariant subset of @xmath678 such that @xmath495 is constant on @xmath677 .",
    "consider two copies of @xmath107 , which will be denoted by @xmath679 and @xmath680 and the maps @xmath681 and @xmath682 defined as @xmath683 for every @xmath684 .",
    "the hilbert map @xmath685 is @xmath2-invariant , and due to the relation between the polynomials its image @xmath686 is a topological space equipped with the relative topology which is a semi - algebraic variety .",
    "the tarski - seidenberg theorem ( see @xcite and references therein for a more detailed explanation ) gives that @xmath687 has a canonical ( whitney ) stratification .",
    "by invariant theory the map @xmath688 restricts to a homeomorphism @xmath689 that happens to be an isomorphism of stratified spaces if @xmath690 is endowed with the orbit type stratification . in order to apply the results obtained in previous sections we will study the case @xmath691 through the image of @xmath688 .",
    "the zero level set of the momentum map is @xmath692 .",
    "so we can identify @xmath20 with the direct product of the two cones defined by the relations @xmath693 this realization of @xmath20 is shown in figure  [ doublecone ] . for future reference in figure  [ doublecone ]",
    "we mark some subsets on each of the cones . for instance in @xmath694",
    "the vertex is marked as @xmath695 , the straight line @xmath696 excluding the origin is labelled @xmath697 , the opposite line @xmath698 also except the origin is labelled as @xmath699 , and finally all the cone except @xmath700 is called @xmath701 ( @xmath701 contains @xmath699 ) .",
    "note from the defining equation of @xmath694 that @xmath699 and @xmath697 form an angle of @xmath702 .",
    "analogous definitions apply to @xmath703 .",
    "the reduced singular space @xmath20 as a product of two cones ]    by proposition [ prop10 ] we know that the orbit types present in @xmath677 are exactly those which are present in @xmath3 , i.e. the elements of @xmath60 .",
    "this implies that the symplectic strata of @xmath20 are in one - to - one correspondence with the strata of @xmath3 , and that both spaces exhibit an identical stratification lattice as we will verify now .",
    "indeed , studying the diagonal action restricted to @xmath677 one finds easily the following orbit types : @xmath704 using the image of the map @xmath688 we have @xmath705 the above sets are the strata of the symplectic stratification lattice predicted by theorem  [ sl ] .",
    "this lattice is shown in figure  [ examplesecondary ] a ) .",
    "recall that the strata for the secondary stratification of each symplectic stratum @xmath145 are of two types , cotangent bundles @xmath382 and seams @xmath353 with @xmath706 defined by .",

    "we embed @xmath664 in @xmath4 by the injection @xmath707 we then have @xmath708 computing the seams and the cotangent bundles we obtain the following realization of these two types of pieces in the image of @xmath688 : @xmath709 according to the results of theorem [ thm8 ] the secondary stratifications of the symplectic strata are : @xmath710 the corresponding stratification lattices are shown in figure  [ examplesecondary ] ( b)-(e ) . the coisotropic stratification lattice is shown in figure  [ examplecoisotropic ] .",

    "first , as mentioned in the introduction , it would be interesting to determine if these reduced spaces , together with the secondary and coisotropic stratifications , have conical structure , satisfy whitney conditions and/or admit singular atlases and smooth structures , as it happens for the symplectic stratification ( see @xcite and @xcite ) . for this",
    ", the symplectic slice theorem of marle , guillemin and sternberg is too weak , and a cotangent bundle adapted version of it , which could detect the secondary and coisotropic strata would be needed .",
    "unfortunately , such a technology does not yet exist in full generality .",
    "some steps have been done in @xcite but it is still lacking a general result .",
    "we expect however that advances in this line of research can lead to the proof that the secondary and the coisotropic stratifications enjoy the conical property and satisfy whitney conditions like the symplectic stratification .    a different direction of study consists of describing reduction at nonzero momentum .",
    "at least for reduction at momentum values with trivial coadjoint orbits it is also possible to obtain a secondary and coisotropic stratification with some modifications of the technology used here .",
    "this will appear elsewhere .",
    "for general momenta the problem is much more involved since the coadjoint representation interacts with the action on the base manifold to produce an isotropy lattice of the momentum level set @xmath721 .",
    "these are aspects of ongoing work on the subject .",
    "even when the secondary stratification of each symplectic stratum is not invariant for the reduced hamiltonian flow , the fact that it captures the bundle structure of the reduced space might be useful for understanding certain qualitative aspects of the reduced dynamics .",
    "a typical situation would be described by the following observation : even when it is known that the isotropy is preserved by the reduced dynamics ( and hence the symplectic strata are dynamically invariant ) , this is not true for the isotropy of the projected dynamics onto @xmath21 .",
    "it is precisely when the hamiltonian evolution crosses different seams within its ambient symplectic stratum that changes in the isotropies of the base points occur .",
    "natural questions arise then , like under what conditions symmetric hamiltonian flows preserve isotropy both in phase and configuration spaces , or when a hamiltonian evolution is maximal , in the sense that every secondary stratum ( and hence every possible isotropy type in the base ) is crossed",
