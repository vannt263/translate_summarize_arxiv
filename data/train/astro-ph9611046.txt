    "sher # 25 ( sher 1965 ) is a b1.5iab supergiant ( moffat 1983 ) similar to sk@xmath669202 , the progenitor of sn1987a .",
    "sher # 25 has a visual magnitude of v @xmath1 122123 ( e.g. , van den bergh 1978 ) .",
    "it is located at @xmath120@xmath7 north of hd 97950 , the core of the @xmath1 4 myr old cluster at the center of the galactic giant  region ngc  3603 at a distance of 67 kpc ( clayton 1986 ; melnick et al .",
    "1989 ) . based on ubv ccd photometry of sher # 25 melnick et al .  derived a visual extinction a@xmath8 and a distance modulus consistent with sher # 25 being associated with ngc 3603 .    in a recent search for emission - line objects in ngc 3603 ( brandner et al .",
    "1997 ) , we found a clumpy ring and a bipolar nebula around sher # 25 .",
    "this ring is similar to that around sn1987a in both size and morphology .",
    "follow - up spectroscopy shows n enrichment in the nebula around sher # 25 , suggesting that sher # 25 is at a similar evolutionary stage as sk@xmath669202 . in this letter",
    ", we report our observations (  2 ) , discuss the physical structure of the nebula around sher # 25 (  3 ) and the evidence for sher # 25 being associated with ngc 3603 (  4 ) , and compare it to sn1987a (  5 ) .",
    "and r images of an 8@xmath9 @xmath10 8@xmath9 field centered on ngc  3603 were obtained at the eso new technology telescope ( ntt ) on 1995 february 8 with the red arm of the eso multi - mode instrument and a 2k tek ccd ( eso # 36 ) .",
    "we used a narrow - band  filter ( @xmath11=1.8 nm ) and a broadband r filter for continuum subtraction .",
    "photometric vri observations and an h@xmath5+[nii ] image ( @xmath11=6.2 nm ) were obtained on 1995 march 2 with the ccd camera at the danish 1.54 m telescope .",
    "the h@xmath5+[nii ] image of the central cluster in ngc 3603 and its surroundings is displayed in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows a continuum - subtracted  ntt - image centered on sher # 25 .",
    "the residuals ( bright features ) are due to charge bleeding as the brightest stars were saturated in the r image .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the location of the blue supergiant sher # 25 above and to the red of the main sequence turn - off .",
    "the stars well above the main - sequence are ( blended ) wolf - rayet and early type o stars located in the very center of the cluster .",
    "long - slit echelle spectra of the eastern cap and the ring were obtained on 1996 january 10 at the ctio 4 m telescope .",
    "the echelle spectrograph was equipped with a 2k tek ccd .",
    "the slit orientation was east - west ( dashed line in figure [ fig2 ] ) and the slit width was 16 .",
    "we adopted rest wavelengths in air of 654.81 nm and 658.36 nm for the two forbidden [ ] lines @xmath12p@xmath13@xmath14d@xmath15 and @xmath12p@xmath15@xmath14d@xmath15 ( e.g. , moore 1959 ) .",
    "relative velocities are accurate to about 0.2 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the absolute calibration with respect to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) has an uncertainty of about 24 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the 2d spectra in the region of the   and [ ] lines . at the position where the slit intersects the ring the two distinct velocity components are clearly visible",
    "a tilted ring around sher # 25 can be clearly seen in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "the semi - major and semi - minor axes are 69 and 305 , respectively . assuming a circular ring geometry",
    ", we derive an inclination angle of 64@xmath0 with respect to the sky plane along the position angle @xmath1 165@xmath0 .",
    "the linear diameter of the ring is 0.4 pc , for a distance of 6 kpc .",
    "the relative velocity difference between the two ring components intersected by the slit is 32 km  s@xmath3 ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] ) . taking projection effects into account",
    ", we derive a de - projected expansion velocity of 20 km  s@xmath3 for the ring and a systemic velocity of v@xmath2 = + 19 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "this value agrees well with radial velocities of molecular cloud cores south of ngc 3603 ( + 12 km  s@xmath3 to + 16 km  s@xmath3 , nrnberger , priv .",
    "comm . ) and supports sher # 25 s association with ngc 3603 .",
    "bipolar filaments to the northeast and to the southwest of sher # 25 are also clearly visible in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] . the northeast filament is not resolved into substructures .",
    "it is blue - shifted by 36.2 km  s@xmath3 from the systemic velocity , indicating an outflow nature .",
    "the southwestern filament shows a complex structure with two apparent shock fronts .",
    "lacking kinematic information , we can not determine whether the southwestern filament is part of a larger 3d structure , i.e. , something hourglass - like .",
    "nevertheless , it is very likely that these bipolar filaments are physically produced by a bipolar outflow .",
    "if the bipolar filaments of sher # 25 are located along an axis perpendicular to the plane defined by the ring , their physical separation from sher # 25 is about 0.5 pc ( 15@xmath7/@xmath16 at 6 kpc ) .",
    "the de - projected expansion velocity of the northeastern filament is @xmath1 83 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the echelle spectra of the ring and the northeast outflow filament show a high [ nii]/  ratio , compared to the background hii region ( see table 1 and figure [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "low - resolution spectra of the north - eastern outflow filament indicate t@xmath17 7000@xmath181000 k and @xmath19 9.8@xmath180.3 m@xmath20 . in a [ oiii]/h@xmath21 vs.  [ nii]/h@xmath5 diagram ,",
    "the north - eastern outflow filament is situated clearly outside the location of hii regions or supernova remnants ( brandner et al .",
    "thus , the high [ nii]/  ratio is caused by an enhanced n abundance , indicating that at least the bipolar filaments around sher # 25 consist of stellar material enriched by the cno cycle .",
    "therefore , sher # 25 very likely is an evolved post - red supergiant .",
    "given the evolutionary stage of sher # 25 , the surrounding nebula may be explained in the framework of interaction between red supergiant ( rsg ) wind and blue supergiant ( bsg ) wind . a 2d ring - like structure ( as opposed to 3d shells )",
    "can be produced if the density of the rsg wind is a strong function of polar angle , peaking along the equatorial plane and decreasing toward the poles ( blondin & lundqvist 1993 ; martin & arnett 1995 ) .",
    "a ring develops as the fast bsg wind sweeps up the dense rsg wind material . at the same time",
    "the density gradient in the rsg wind allows the fast bsg wind to expand more easily in polar directions .",
    "this process might lead to an hourglass - shaped emission nebula as has been observed in the young planetary nebula mycn18 ( sahai et al .",
    "the clumpy structure of the ring ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) very likely originates in rayleigh - taylor instabilities at the interface between the swept - up slow rsg wind and the fast bsg wind .",
    "the expansion velocities and physical dimensions yield a dynamical age of @xmath1 9000 yr for the ring and @xmath1 6000 yr for the polar outflows . applying a self - similarity solution for the interaction regions of colliding winds ( e.g. ,",
    "chevalier & imamura 1983 ) we can carry out a crude analysis of the observed velocities . in the following we assume constant mass loss rates and constant wind velocities for the slow wind and the fast wind , a stalled shock ( pressure equilibrium ) in a spherical symmetric fast wind , and an adiabatic ( non - radiative ) shock .",
    "the shock then expands with a velocity of @xmath22 where @xmath23 @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are mass - loss rate and wind velocity of the fast wind ( fw ) and the slow wind ( sw ) , respectively .",
    "if the fast wind is isotropic and does not show any variation in density as a function of polar angle , then the ratio of the expansion velocity of the polar outflow ( 83 km  s@xmath3 ) to that of the ring ( 20 km  s@xmath3 ) gives us directly the ratio of rsg mass loss in both directions : m@xmath27(0@xmath0)/m@xmath27(90@xmath0 ) @xmath1 16:1 .",
    "this is in reasonable agreement with the ratios of 20:1 and 10:1 computed for the progenitor of sn1987a by blondin & lundqvist ( 1993 ) and by martin & arnett ( 1995 ) , respectively . assuming a fast wind velocity of 800 km  s@xmath3 , a slow wind velocity of 50 km  s@xmath3 , and a ratio of the slow wind and fast wind mass - loss rates along the stellar equator of 90:1 ( 6:1 in polar direction ) one is able to reproduce the observed shock velocities in the framework of this very simplified model",
    "the center of the inner ring does not coincide with the position of sher # 25 ( offset 1@xmath7 to 2@xmath7 ) .",
    "this may be due to a movement of sher # 25 relative to the surrounding ism .",
    "martin & arnett ( 1995 ) pointed out that such a movement would produce asymmetric polar outflow structures , which in turn might explain the different appearance of the northeastern and southwestern polar outflow filaments of sher # 25 .",
    "however , the interpretation of the filaments may be complicated by sher # 25 s apparent location at the edge of a wind - blown cavity excavated by the central cluster of ngc  3603 ( figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this cavity has a diameter of 2 pc , a dynamical age of 10@xmath28 yr ( clayton 1986 ) and may have been created by the onset of the wolf - rayet phase of the three central stars of ngc 3603 ( drissen et al .",
    "what evidence do we have that sher # 25 is indeed a member of the giant hii region ngc 3603 ?",
    "firstly , as discussed above , the systemic velocity of the ring is in good agreement with the line - of - sight velocities of the cloud cores south of hd 97950 .",
    "secondly , sher # 25 is not the only bsg in the ngc 3603 region .",
    "spectroscopy by moffat ( 1983 ) revealed two other bsg in the vicinity of the cluster core ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] ) . the locations of sher # 18 ( o6if ) and sher # 23 ( o9.5iab ) are also indicated in our v vs.  v - i cmd ( figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the apparent lack of bsgs with similar reddening among the `` field stars '' ( thin dots in figure [ fig3 ] ) adds additional weight to the assumption that sher # 25 is associated with ngc 3603 .",
    "could sher # 25 then have been born at the same time as the massive central stars of the cluster ?",
    "this would require that sher # 25 originally had been at least as massive as these central stars and has gone through a violent luminous blue variable ( lbv ) phase with a total mass - loss of more than 50% of its initial mass ( i.e. , m @xmath29 25 m@xmath30 ) before it became a bsg .",
    "indeed , kinematical age , expansion velocity , and abundances of sher # 25 s nebula are comparable to those of the ag car nebula ( cf .  e.g. , leitherer et al .",
    "1994 ) . with m@xmath31 -91 , sher",
    "# 25 s luminosity is in the range of luminosities observed in other lbvs .",
    "thus , an lbv evolutionary scenario for sher # 25 and its circumstellar surrounding can not be entirely excluded .",
    "the simultaneous presence of bsgs and stars of mk type o3v ( cf .",
    "drissen et al .  1995 ) requires at least two distinct episodes of star formation in ngc 3603 separated by @xmath1 10 myr .",
    "moffat ( 1983 ) and melnick et al .",
    "( 1989 ) already suggested that star formation in ngc 3603 might not have been coeval .",
    "the starburst in the dense cluster of ngc 3603 might have been initiated by the first generation of massive stars through their interaction with a dense cloud core .",
    "subsequently , this cloud core developed into the present - day starburst .",
    "a similar evolutionary scenario has been suggested by hyland et al .",
    "( 1992 ) in order to explain the starburst in the 30 dor region .",
    "sher # 25 s circumstellar nebula resembles that of sn1987a in many aspects . both objects have an equatorial ring and bipolar nebulae , and show high [ nii]/  ratios , indicating an enhanced n abundance .",
    "the n enrichment indicates that the rings and the bipolar nebulae consist of mass lost from the progenitor at an earlier evolutionary stage and swept up by the fast bsg wind .",
    "surface enrichment with material processed by the cno cycle typically occurs at the very end of the rsg phase within the last 10@xmath28 yr of rsg evolution .",
    "yet , differences exist . as shown in table 1 , the expansion velocities and [ nii]/  ratios are different .",
    "the [ ] /  ratio of the nebula around sher # 25 is lower than the ratio observed in the outer northern ring around sn1987a despite the lower n abundance in the lmc .",
    "furthermore , sher # 25 exhibits a higher [ nii]/  ratio in the bipolar nebulae than in the ring , while sn1987a shows an opposite trend .",
    "the similarities between the nebulae seem to suggest that sher # 25 is at a similar evolutionary stage as the late progenitor of sn1987a , sk@xmath669202 .",
    "however , the differences between the nebulae imply that the evolutionary history differs .",
    "this may be due to the abundance differences between the young population in the lmc and in the milky way , and to mass differences between the two stars .",
    "sher # 25 appears to have been in a rather stable bsg evolutionary phase during the past decades covered by photometric measurements .",
    "its photometry ( table 2 ) is quite inhomogeneous owing to the variety of different measurement techniques used , crowding problems , and spatial variations in the strength of the nebular background emission .",
    "the overall amplitude of variation in v is less than 025 within the last 35 yr , and less than 01 over the last 25 yr . the progenitor of sn1987a did not stand out as a variable star , either .",
    "will sher # 25 explode like sk@xmath669202 in the near future ?",
    "the presence of the ring around sher # 25 , the n enrichment in the outflows , and the surface enrichment in metals all suggest that sher # 25 has passed at least once through the rsg phase and is now well within its final bsg phase , which may last a few 10@xmath28 yr in total depending on the initial stellar mass ( see martin & arnett 1995 ) .",
    "evolutionary models for massive stars , however , still suffer from many unsolved problems , such as the amount of overshooting , semiconvection , mixing , and mass loss , the choice of convection criteria , and metallicity effects ( see , e.g. , langer & maeder 1995 ) . at present , it is premature to predict whether sher # 25 will succeed sk-69 202 to provide another spectacular supernova in the southern sky soon .",
