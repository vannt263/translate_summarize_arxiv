    "population level estimates of risk factors are of major interest in epidemiology .",
    "data on risk factors such as blood pressure , cholesterol level , body mass index , alcohol consumption and daily smoking are often collected in health examination surveys ( he s ) . in a he",
    "s , the data on risk factors are collected usually via both questionnaires and physical measurements . the trends of population level risk factors are monitored and they are valuable input for policy decisions .",
    "missing data by unit nonresponse occurs in a he s as invitees neither participate to measurements nor return a survey questionnaire .",
    "the decision about participation have been found to depend on the risk factors , such as smoking @xcite , either directly or via a common cause such as health awareness .",
    "this may be deduced from the fact that the non - participants have a higher risk of death @xcite .",
    "this dependence causes missing data to be classified as missing not at random ( mnar ) @xcite . because the data are mnar , the population level risk factors calculated from the participants data are biased , and they usually give an overly healthy view of the population .",
    "biased estimates of risk factor prevalence may seriously misinform decision makers . instead of analysing only the participants data , the posterior distributions of risk factor levels of a whole sample , including non - participants , should be estimated .",
    "this requires external information and modelling assumptions .    in this paper , we demonstrate how follow - up data on endpoints associated with the risk factor of the interest provides external information that allows us to reduce the bias caused by selective non - participation .",
    "we propose a bayesian method for the estimation of risk factor prevalence and the missing data mechanism , when the data are mnar .    our datasets origin from the finrisk studies , which are national he s providing information about the health of finns .",
    "we improve and extend an earlier work @xcite on the estimation of smoking prevalence from finrisk data .",
    "the key improvements are : a fully bayesian model is used , the survival model is more flexible , and informative prior is utilised instead of assumption of conditional independence ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 2 ) ) .",
    "differently from @xcite the study years 2002 and 2007 are included in the modelling .",
    "next section describes the data of the finrisk studies and follow - up .",
    "section 3 presents the bayesian model and the priors that we apply to smoking prevalence estimation .",
    "section 4 explains model fitting , and section 5 provides a simulation study on the proposed approach . in section 6",
    "we apply our approach to real data from the finrisk studies and provide smoking prevalence estimates for both men and women and compare our approach to multiple imputations by chained equations using r software @xcite and ` mice ` package @xcite .",
    "section 7 discusses the results and methods presented .",
    "our he s data contain eight finrisk studies conducted every five years 1972 - 2007 @xcite .",
    "the data are restricted to the two regions ( northern savonia and north karelia ) that have been included in all eight studies .",
    "thus , each finrisk study does not represent the finnish populations as a whole , but instead represents the populations of the chosen regions .    in each study year , persons were selected to the finrisk studies in a random sampling stratified by region , gender and age group . each person selected to",
    "the study received a letter of invitation , in which he or she was asked to fill in a survey questionnaire and to participate physical measurements in the local survey site .",
    "if the person participated , the filled questionnaire was collected and the physical measures were taken . if the person did not participate , then risk factors are missing , but background variables study year , age , gender , and region , are known from the sampling frame . table [ table - participation ] shows that the participation rates have dramatically decreased from 1972 to 2007 .",
    "it can be also seen that women have participated more actively than men in all study years .",

    "to impute the missing values for smoking indicators , the data augmentation was applied @xcite . a hierarchical bayesian model described in figure [ figure - dag ]",
    "the augmented data for smoking indicator @xmath22 are drawn from fully conditional distribution @xmath89 , given its parent nodes ( @xmath41 ) and child nodes ( @xmath18 and @xmath43 ) .    to fit this kind of data augmentation model",
    ", we used just another gibbs sampler -software ( jags ) @xcite , and r @xcite .",
    "seven parallel mcmc chains ( rjags package in r , @xcite ) were used in model fitting .",
    "each chain had @xmath90 burn - in iterations , @xmath91 actual iterations with thinning of @xmath9 , which makes a total of @xmath92 iterations per chain to be saved .",
    "the time consumed for this model fitting was about @xmath93 hours , which makes @xmath94 seconds per each iteration .",
    "chain convergence was examined both visually and using brooks - gelman @xmath95-diagnostics @xcite .",
    "all the @xmath95s for model parameters were below @xmath96 ( which indicates convergence ) .",
    "to demonstrate the difference of proposed method and the mar imputation , we also did ordinary multiple imputations using the ` mice ` package in r. the method applied to mar imputation was a logistic regression .",
    "the imputation model had full interactions between year of birth , gender , region and year , and full interactions between gender , event indicator and age at the event / censoring .",
    "the year of birth and the age at event / censoring were used as linear covariates and the other as categorical variables .",
    "we constructed a simulation experiment to evaluate the performance of the model .",
    "the actual values of the background variables from the finrisk study were used together with parameter estimates from one of the preliminary runs fitting the model .",
    "thus , the simulation experiment had conditions similar to the finrisk study , e.g. the smoking prevalence had a decreasing trend for men and an increasing trend for women . for both genders",
    "the participation was selective , and also decreasing with study year .",
    "the model fitting for the simulated data was very similar to the model fitting for finrisk data .",
    "all the @xmath95-diagnostics were below @xmath96 which indicates convergence .",
    "the posterior correlations were inspected and we found strong correlations ( @xmath97 or @xmath98 ) between some of the parameters , which are described as follows .",
    "what comes to risk factor model parameters , the rest of the posterior correlations were close to zero , except the correlations between @xmath80}$ ] and @xmath81}$ ] , which were stronger than the others .",
    "the median of these correlations was @xmath99 and the range was @xmath100 $ ] .",
    "conditioning with @xmath18 likely causes these posterior correlations . on participation model",
    ", the strongest posterior correlations were found between the @xmath51}$ ] and @xmath52}$ ] . for men , those eight correlations ranged between @xmath101 and @xmath102 , and for women between @xmath103 and @xmath104 . in the follow - up model , strong positive correlations occurred particularly between sequential parameters , which is natural to this type of models .",
    "the highest correlations for men were @xmath105 and for women @xmath106 .    despite the selective non - participation ,",
    "our approach is capable of reducing the bias of the smoking prevalence under the conditions experimented ( figure [ simulation_trends ] ) .",
    "it can be seen that with an exception of women in 1972 , the true prevalence is located inside the credible interval and there is no indication of systematic bias in the posterior mean .",
    "in contrast , the prevalence calculated using only the participants systematically underestimates the true prevalence .",
    "the figure [ finrisk_trends ] shows that the difference between the participant smoking prevalence and the bayesian smoking prevalence posterior in the finrisk data was the highest during the study years 1977 , 1982 , and 1987 ( figure [ finrisk_trends ] ) .",
    "starting from the 1992 the complete - case trends are within the 95% credible interval of the bayesian posterior trends , but they are systematically below the posterior mean . the length of follow - up is shorter for later study years compared to earlier ones , and it may have an effect to the posterior . the mar imputation seems to give estimates that are very close to the estimates from the complete - case analysis .",
    "the values of the region variable @xmath30 for the study years 1972 and 1977 were missing for non - participants .",
    "we used a single imputation with fixed probabilities @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "we decided to use single imputation a prior to model fitting because the regions were rather similar with respect to smoking prevalence , and the participation rates were high .",
    "we have proposed a bayesian approach to reduce non - participation bias in he s studies , and assessed our approach using a simulation experiment .",
    "we compared our approach with a standard mar imputation , which was easier to use , but did not reduce the non - participation bias .",
    "the proposed approach appears to reduce the non - participation bias .",
    "possible extensions to bayesian models would be to include other outcomes , for which the smoking is a major risk factor ; e.g. cardiovascular diseases ( cvd ) or mortality .",
    "cvd have more major risk factors other than smoking .",
    "an episode of cvd can be attributable to e.g. high cholesterol levels , but also to smoking , thus information on the other health outcomes than just copd or lung cancer can provide us with more information on the smoking status . if a data set contained information on these other risk factors , prediction of the missing smoking status could be even more accurate .",
    "there are two major limitations in our approach ; the follow - up data must be available and must contain enough information about the risk factor of interest . in many countries ,",
    "the he s data can not be linked to follow - up data regarding both participants and non - participants .",
    "trends by ordinary mar multiple imputation are essentially the same as participants trends .",
    "thus , the mar approach does not reduce the bias of risk factor levels . although there may be ways to improve the imputation model @xcite , the mar imputation do not account for selective non - participation , as seen in figure [ finrisk_trends ] .",
    "the bayesian model fitting is often a computational challenge , particularly when there are a lot of missing data .",
    "the memory management and computation time were issues in our case study , due to a large amount of missing data .",
    "in our first attempts , we tried to save all the imputations , which filled computers ram memory quite rapidly .",
    "we later realised that it is possible to calculate sufficient ( summary ) statistics , e.g. count of smokers and non - smokers , and store only them .",
    "we also reduced the time required per one iteration by coarsening the continuous covariates ( the age ) of the survival model and summing over discrete or discretised covariates , and by modelling the number of events in each risk group using poisson distribution .",
    "another challenge was the posterior correlations caused by the model structure and mnar -missingness .",
    "one possibility to alleviate this problem could be to develop a custom mcmc algorithm with blocked updating of the parameters with high posterior correlations @xcite .",
    "however , this often requires custom programming and is therefore much more laborious than an application based on jags , which we have applied .",
    "selective non - participation in hess is an important problem that may have implications to the decisions on health policy .",
    "our solution is not simple to implement but the reduction of selection bias makes it worth of the effort .",
