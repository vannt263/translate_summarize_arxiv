    "it has been universally accepted that a considerable fraction of a pulsar s spin - down energy is converted into an outflow of relativistic particles .",
    "this outflow is terminated by a strong shock resulting when the relativistic particles interact with ejecta from the host supernova remnant ( snr ) .",
    "high - energy particles further accelerated at this shock and diffusing downstream emit radio to tev @xmath2-rays via synchrotron or inverse compton processes .",
    "the non - thermal emission is observed as a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) .",
    "one key event occurring during the evolution of a pwn ( gaensler & slane 2006 and references therein ) is its interaction with the reverse shock propagating back into the snr interior .",
    "it is assumed that this interaction causes magnetic - field amplification and hence rapid synchrotron cooling of the highest energy ( tev ) relativistic electrons .",
    "since the cooling time of gev electrons responsible for the radio emission is considerably longer ( the lifetime of relativistic electrons inversely depends on their energy ) , a radio relic pwn is left behind for a long time after this interaction .    of the more than 50 known pwne ( e.g. , kargaltsev & pavlov 2008 ) , the vela pwn , associated with the middle - aged ( 11000yr : reichley et al .",
    "1970 ) vela snr ( see , figure  [ fig : all_image ] ) , is located the nearest to earth ( @xmath3290pc : dodson et al .",
    "this proximity makes it an ideal target for detailed spatial studies . with its superior ( sub - arcsecond ) spatial resolution ,",
    "chandra x - ray observatory revealed spectacular small - scale ( @xmath3 ) structures within the vela pwn , including jets and arcs around the pulsar ( helfand et al .",
    "2001 ; pavlov et al .",
    "these features are surrounded by a bright compact nebula emitting non - thermal x - rays , a `` kidney - bean '' nebula of size @xmath32@xmath4 ( harnden et al.1985 ) .",
    "the spectra of these features are characterized by a power - law component , with photon index varying from @xmath5 for the inner jets and arcs to @xmath6 for the surroundings ( e.g. , kargaltsev & pavlov 2008 ) .",
    "this system is further embedded in a large region emitting non - thermal x - rays whose power - law index ( @xmath7 ) is steeper than those in the inner regions ( markwardt & gelman 1995 ; 1998 ; mangano et al .  2005 ; lamassa et al .",
    "however , the full morphology of this non - thermal x - ray  emitting region ( x - ray pwn ) is not yet known , because vela has not been mapped by a sufficiently broad band imaging spectrometer .",
    "it is important for the study of the evolution of the vela pwn and pwne in general to map and understand the large - scale ( @xmath8 ) structure of the vela pwn across the electromagnetic spectrum . in the radio band ,",
    "the vela pwn is a network of bright filaments encompassing a large , 3@xmath92@xmath10 , region around the pulsar as shown in figure  [ fig : all_image ] ( c ) .",
    "it is referred to as vela x ( frail et al .",
    "1997 ; bock et al .",
    "1998 and references therein ) .",
    "vela x is asymmetric relative to the pulsar .",
    "both the chaotic filamentation and the asymmetry led blondin et al.(2001 ) to propose that vela x arose from interaction between the pwn and the reverse shock of the vela snr in an inhomogeneous ambient medium .",
    "thus , the vela pwn is regarded as a prototype radio relic pwn ( gaensler & slane 2006 ) .",
    "recently , observations using hess , agile , and fermi have revealed tev ( figure  [ fig : all_image ] ( d ) ) and gev @xmath2-ray ( figure  [ fig : all_image ] ( e ) ) maps ( aharonian et al.2006 ; pellizzoni et al .  2010 ; abdo et al .  2010 ) .",
    "the tev / gev morphologies are also asymmetric relative to the pulsar , whereas they are quite different with each other , showing chaotic structures of the vela pwn .",
    "x - ray mapping of the vela pwn is now ongoing .",
    "an important point is that the lifetime of relativistic electrons emitting x - rays is the shortest , because they are the most energetic ( assuming the gev and tev emission is inverse compton radiation ) .",
    "therefore , the x - ray morphology might be different from vela x , if vela x is really a long - lived radio relic .",
    "we here report on the detection of x - ray synchrotron emission beyond the boundary of vela x , based on suzaku / xis data with unprecedented high sensitivity in the hard x - ray energy band ( 210kev ) .",
    "our analysis indicates that this emission is associated with the vela pwn , strongly suggesting that the morphology of vela pwn in x - rays is different from that in the radio ( i.e. , vela x ) .",
    "we suggest that the x - ray pwn and vela x are formed by distinct populations relativistic electrons , consistent with the picture inferred from recent multiwavelength spectral modeling of vela x ( lamassa et al.2008 ; de jager et al .",
    "this implies that vela x is indeed a radio relic of the interaction between the vela pwn and the reverse shock .",
    "we observed part of the vela snr with _ suzaku _ ( mitsuda et al .",
    "2007 ) in four pointings during 2010 may 23 .",
    "we here concentrate on the data taken by the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis : koyama et al .  2007 ) .",
    "the xis consists of two front - illuminated ( fi : xis0 and xis3 ) ccd cameras and one back - illuminated ( bi : xis1 ) ccd camera .",
    "each camera covers an identical imaging area of @xmath11 .",

    "another box labeled bg shown in the figure represents the xis fov where we estimate local x - ray background for our spectral analysis .",
    "figure  [ fig : all_image ] ( b ) shows a hard - band rass image covering the same area in figure  [ fig : all_image ] ( a ) , from which the galactic snrs puppis  a and vela jr .  superposed along the line of sight appear as bright extended regions at the northwestern ( nw ) and southeastern ( se ) corners of the remnant , respectively , whereas the vela pwn is not apparent .",
    "figure  [ fig : all_image ] ( c ) presents a radio ( 843 mhz ) image of the central region of the vela snr .",
    "the network of filaments which forms vela x is clearly seen in the figure .",
    "our xis fov are located just outside vela x to the northeast ( ne ) .    using the latest caldb files ( e.g. , a cti calibration file of version 20091202 ) , we reprocessed and cleaned the data according to the standard criteria recommended by the calibration team of suzaku / xis .",
    "after the screening , the remaining exposure times are 25.3ks , 23.2ks , 16.8ks , and 16.8ks for p1 , p2 , p3 , and p4 , respectively .",

    "this contrast is most likely caused by inhomogeneities of thermal emission from the vela snr .",
    "figure  [ fig : xis_image ] right shows hard x - ray emission extending throughout the fov .",
    "this emission is at least a factor of 2 above the local background level .    as the first step of our spectral analysis",

    "( see , figure  [ fig : all_image ] ) along with the local background corrected for effective area .",
    "we see that these spectra do not show hard x - ray emission , indicating that ( 1 ) the hard x - ray emission in our fov ( p1p4 ) does not extend to these regions and ( 2 ) the local cosmic x - ray background is quite uniform around the vela snr .    in the following fitting procedure ,",
    "we use photons in the energy range of 0.411.0kev , and employ the xspec software ( version 12.6.0q ) . since the two fi chips ( xis0 and xis3 ) have similar spectral responses , their spectra are summed to improve the photon statistics .",
    "we fit the fi and bi spectra simultaneously .",
    "we manually adjust the energy scale to obtain better fits , by allowing energy - scale offsets to vary freely for the fi and the bi detectors , respectively . before fitting",
    ", each spectrum is grouped into bins with at least @xmath320 counts after subtracting the local background , which allows us to perform a @xmath15 test .",
    "we follow previous rosat studies , using a two - temperature collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) plasma model ( bocchino et al .  1997 ; 1999",
    "; lu & aschenbach 2000 ; miceli et al .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the rosat data have inadequate spectral resolution to reveal non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) , but that nei conditions can not be rejected by the data ( bocchino et al .",
    "1999 ; miceli et al.2005 ) .",
    "in fact , recent x - ray ccd observations of several locations in the vela snr have revealed nei conditions ( e.g. , tsunemi et al.1999 ; katsuda & tsunemi 2005 ; yamaguchi & katsuda 2009 ) .",
    "we therefore employ a two - component thermal plasma model that combines nei and cie conditions : the hotter component ( hereafter , t1 ) uses an nei model , whereas the cooler component ( hereafter , t2 ) is assumed to be in cie , because the data can not distinguish for it between nei and cie .",
    "we adopt the tbabs model ( wilms et al .",
    "2000 ) for the absorption , either vnei or vpshock model ( borkowski et al .  2001 ) with variable abundances for t1 , and the apec model ( smith et al .",
    "2001 ) with solar abundances for t2 , respectively .",
    "the vnei model has a single ionization timescale ( @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the electron density and @xmath18 is the time after the shock heating ) , whereas the vpshock model assumes a range of @xmath19 , which we take 0 to the fitted maximum value . in these thermal emission models ,",
    "the solar abundances are based on anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) .",
    "when applying this model for each spectrum from the four fields ( p1p4 ) , we obtain the best - fit models shown in figure  [ fig : fit1 ] .",
    "we find that the models are rejected with high confidence ( reduced @xmath15 of @xmath32 ) .",
    "we also find unusually high electron temperatures of a few kev and very low metal abundances below 0.1 solar values for the high - temperature component .",
    "addition of a power - law component resolves the uncomfortable physical conditions and results in acceptable fits ( formally speaking , acceptable only if we consider systematic uncertainties ) .",
    "the addition of a thermal component with an electron temperature of a few kev , instead of the power - law component , also yields satisfactory fits .",
    "however , again , such a high - temperature component is not expected for evolved snrs like vela ( 11000yr ) .",
    "furthermore , the thermal component shows implausible metal abundances of @xmath30.01 solar values .",
    "therefore , the thermal interpretation is unlikely to be correct , and we therefore accept the non - thermal power - law interpretation .",
    "table  [ tab : fit_param ] summarizes the fit details .",
    "figure  [ fig : fit1 ] shows the xis spectra along with the best - fit models of tbabs@xmath11(vnei + apec + power - law ) and tbabs@xmath11(vpshock + apec + power - law ) .",
    "we find that the results from vnei and vpshock ( for t1 ) are consistent with each other .",
    "possible sources for the power - law component would be either the extended vela pwn , relativistic particles accelerated in the vela snr s shell , or unrelated background possibly connected to vela jr .",
    "the large distance between vela jr .  and",
    "our xis fov ( see , figure  [ fig : all_image ] ( b ) ) make it difficult for emission from vela jr .  to be present in our fov .",
    "in addition , as can be found in table  [ tab : fit_param ] , the relatively flat photon index of @xmath1 may rule out an association with the shell of vela jr .  which shows a steeper photon index of @xmath20 ( e.g. , hiraga et al .",
    "2009 ) , though a population of relativistic particles escaping from vela jr .",
    "would have a flatter spectrum as lower - energy particles would be unable to diffuse as far ahead .",
    "it is also unlikely that the evolved vela snr show such a flat photon index , if non - thermal emission is present .",
    "although we can not fully exclude the possibility that the hard x - ray emission is another pwn along the line of sight , the most plausible interpretation seems to be an association with the vela pwn .",
    "we will further discuss this interpretation in the next section .",
    "the power - law flux gradually increases from p1 to p4 by a factor of @xmath32 .",
    "the photon index is almost constant at @xmath212.4 .",
    "one may worry about possible coupling between the photon index and other parameters . to this end",
    ", we investigate confidence contours of the photon index against the electron temperature in t1 ( using vnei ) , the emission measure in t1 ( using vnei ) , and the normalization in the power - law component .",
    "figure  [ fig : conf_cont ] shows the confidence contours .",
    "we find conservative 90% confidence ranges of the photon index in the four fov to be 2.22.6 .",
    "metal abundances are generally sub - solar and their relative abundances are consistent with the solar ratios within a factor of 2 .",
    "the inferred electron temperatures ( @xmath30.1kev and @xmath30.3kev ) are similar to those found in the pure ism components in the northern shell regions ( miceli et al .  2005 ; 2008 ) .",
    "these results suggest that the thermal emission in our fov is not dominated by sn ejecta but by shock - heated interstellar medium .",
    "the emission measure of t2 varies significantly from field to field , suggesting interstellar medium inhomogeneities .",
    "it should be , however , noted that absolute ( relative to h ) abundances are difficult to measure , especially when thermal x - ray continuum is contaminated by nonthermal continuum emission . in this context , the ejecta origin for the thermal components can not be fully excluded .",
    "in fact , some other regions in the remnant show evidence of ejecta ; e.g. , the closest ejecta - dominated region to our fov is the so - called `` cocoon '' located south of the pulsar ( lamassa et al .  2008 ; mori et al .  in preparation ) . revealing the ejecta distribution in this remnant is a topic for future work .",
    "we here examine the srcut model ( reynolds 1998 ) instead of the power - law model for p4 . in this fitting",
    ", we fix the radio photon index to @xmath14=0.4 , which is a typical value for vela x ( alvarez et al .",
    "the radio intensity at 1 ghz is treated as either a fixed parameter or a free parameter . for the former ( fixed )",
    "case , we use the intensity of 10 jy , which is inferred from the most image in figure  [ fig : all_image ] ( whose image resolution is : bock et al .",
    "1998 ) smoothed with suzaku s spatial resolution of ( serlemitsos et al .",
    "we allow the roll - off frequency to vary freely .",
    "the other parameters are treated as in table  [ tab : fit_param ] .",
    "we find that the srcut model does not fit as well as the power - law model ( @xmath15 values are 879 or 519 for fixed or free radio intensity , respectively ) .",
    "nonetheless , we note that the best - fit radio intensity inferred from the srcut model of the latter case is @xmath30.01 jy , which is three orders of magnitude smaller than that of vela x. this might imply that x - ray emission is not associated with vela x.",
    "utilizing the high sensitivity of the xis , we found diffuse , hard x - ray emission in four fov located @xmath3 northeast of the vela pulsar .",
    "they are thus located just outside vela x , a network of radio filaments that has been suggested to be a relic of interaction between the pwn and the reverse shock .",
    "the hard x - ray spectra are featureless and are well represented by a power - law component .",
    "figure  [ fig : index_flux ] shows photon index ( circles ) and flux ( triangles ) of the power - law component as a function of the distance from the vela pulsar , which is derived using the vnei model for the t1 component ( see , table  [ tab : fit_param ] ) .",
    "we see that the photon index is almost constant at @xmath212.4 , consistent with that found in the southern outer region of vela x ( lamassa et al .",
    "2008 ; mori et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "on the other hand , the power - law flux gradually decreases with increasing distance from the pulsar .",
    "moreover , the power - law component becomes negligible at larger distances from the pulsar , including regions in the northern shell ( miceli et al .",
    "2005 ; 2006 ; 2008 ) and the vela shrapnel to the east ( tsunemi et al .  1999 ; miyata et al .",
    "2001 ; katsuda & tsunemi 2005 ; 2006 ; yamaguchi & katsuda 2009 ) .",
    "these facts suggest that the hard x - ray emission found in our fov is related to the vela pwn , and thus the pwn in x - ray extends beyond the radio pwn ( i.e. , vela x ) .",
    "we note that other evolved pwne associated with psr  j18261334 ( uchiyama et al .",
    "2009 ) and psr  j1809193 ( anada et al .",
    "2010 ) share the large - scale ( @xmath13 several pc ) photon index uniformity , in contrast to young pwne where the spectrum hardens toward the pulsars ( e.g. , mori et al .",
    "2004 and references therein ) .",
    "our finding that the x - ray vela pwn extends farther than vela x provides us with important insight into the origin of relativistic electrons .",
    "the mechanisms that potentially limit pwn size are synchrotron cooling , diffusion , or convection ( advection ) of the relativistic electrons",
    ". if cooling is important and relativistic electrons systematically flow outward , the x - ray size must be smaller than the radio size , since the lifetime of x - ray  emitting high - energy ( tev ) electrons is much shorter than that of radio - emitting low - energy ( gev ) electrons .",
    "an example for such pwne would be the crab nebula",
    ". in the other cases , the size would be independent of wavelength ; in other words , the size in x - ray and radio would be identical like 3c  58 .",
    "our result , x - ray  emitting particles beyond the radio - emitting particles , is inconsistent with these expectations .",
    "this difficulty can be resolved , however , if we postulate that the x - ray  emitting electrons are not physically related to those forming vela x. in fact , recent multiwavelength spectral modeling of the non - thermal emission in the cocoon have suggested an excess of low - energy ( gev ) electrons ( lamassa et al.2008 ; de jager et al .",
    "2008 ; pellizzoni et al .",
    "2010 ; abdo et al.2010 ) .",
    "thus , our result provides strong support for the idea that distinct populations relativistic electrons generate the x - ray pwn and vela x from an independent , morphological point of view .",
    "we here speculate how the x - ray pwn becomes more extended than the radio pwn ( vela x ) .",
    "numerical simulations show that the reverse shock formed in the snr starts crushing the pwn on a time scale of @xmath33000 yr after the sn explosion ( blondin et al .",
    "2001 ; bucciantini et al .",
    "2003 ) . during the next @xmath33000 yr or so",
    ", hydrodynamic instabilities at the contact discontinuity between the sn ejecta and the pwn create filamentary features , which probably have amplified magnetic fields , which in turn radiate synchrotron emission efficiently .",
    "this is the process considered to be the origin of vela x. given an snr age of 11000 yr , the age of vela x would therefore be roughly 5000 yr . because the lifetime of radio - emitting electrons is longer than the age of the vela snr , it is possible that these filamentary features have persisted as vela x since its birth ( blondin et al .",
    "2001 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the lifetime of the relativistic electrons emitting synchrotron x - rays is much shorter . using the most recent estimate of the magnetic field b=4@xmath22 g in the cocoon ( and halo ) of vela x ( abdo et al .",
    "2010 ) , the synchrotron cooling time for electrons emitting synchrotron x - rays with a characteristic energy @xmath23=2kev is @xmath33400 ( b/4 @xmath22g)@xmath24(@xmath23/2 kev)@xmath25 yr ( de jager & djannati - ata 2008 ) .",
    "this lifetime is less than the estimated age of vela x. further , if we consider that magnetic fields were amplified at the time of interaction between the reverse shock and the pwn , then the lifetime is even shorter .",
    "therefore , most electrons , which had emitted synchrotron x - rays when vela x was created , have already burned - out . in this case",
    ", it is reasonable to consider that the source of x - ray emission in the vela pwn is a fresh population of high - energy electrons that overran the radio relic ( vela x ) . whereas this interpretation seems likely",
    ", we should keep in mind that the estimates of the age of vela x ( @xmath35000yr ) and the lifetime of x - ray  emitting relativistic electrons ( @xmath33400yr ) are quite uncertain ; both estimates are not as accurate as @xmath350% .",
    "therefore , at this point we can not rule out other more exotic possibilities , e.g. , somewhat lower - energy electrons at the edge of vela x are now encountering higher magnetic fields for some reason , in which they can radiate x - rays .    based on systematic studies of pwne using suzaku and chandra , bamba et al .",
    "( 2010 ) report that x - ray pwne continue to expand until an age of @xmath3100kyr .",
    "figure 3 in bamba et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , showing x - ray size vs.  characteristic age for 8 pwne , suggests that the x - ray size of the vela pwn at an age of 11000yr should be @xmath3510pc .",
    "the farthest edge of our xis fov is @xmath38pc away from the pulsar ( at a distance of 290pc ) , within the size range inferred for other pwne . to investigate how the x - ray pwn expands to such an extent",
    "is left for future work . to do this ,",
    "we need more information on the extent and morphology of the hard x - rays .",
    "so far , the only large - scale ( @xmath8 ) map of the x - ray synchrotron nebula around the vela pulsar is the significance - contour map in 2.510kev range by willmore et al .",
    "( 1992 ) who used the birmingham coded mask telescope .",
    "the authors found a diffuse , hard x - ray feature extending approximately 1@xmath10 to the ne and sw , and interpreted it to originate from the vela pwn .",
    "its ne edge corresponds to our innermost ( the nearest to the pulsar ) xis fov , p4 , where we find the strongest intensity of hard x - ray emission among the four ( p1p4 ) fov .",
    "therefore , it appears that the suzaku / xis has unveiled that the pwn extends beyond the ne edge defined by willmore et al .",
    "however , we suspect that the significance - contour map does not reflect a true hard x - ray map . for example",
    ", the map does not show vela jr .",
    "whose nw rim is more than 10 times brighter than p4 and thus should have been detected ( 15kev : pannuti et al .",
    "moreover , it should be noted that the significance level of the suggested pwn feature is not very high , only 1.53 sigma .",
    "in fact , there are a number of such low - significance hot spots in the map .",
    "most of these features do not have counterparts in other wavelengths .",
    "while the authors interpreted that they are blobs of material at a wide range of temperatures , an alternative interpretation would be that they are just statistical noise . given these considerations , we believe that the map presented in willmore et al .",
    "( 1992 ) is not conclusive .",
    "dedicated observations of vela x and its surroundings with x - ray ccd spectrometers such as suzaku / xis or xmm - newton / epic are eagerly desired to reveal definitive structures of the x - ray vela pwn as well as to investigate the evolution of pwne in general .",
    "we have detected hard x - ray emission just outside vela x , using four suzaku / xis observations .",
    "our analysis suggests that it is of power - law origin and is associated with vela pwn .",
    "however , the fact that the x - ray extent is larger than vela x strongly suggests that the hard x - ray emission is not related to vela x , invoking distinct populations relativistic electrons for the x - ray pwn and vela x  an interpretation recently inferred from multiwavelength spectral modelings of vela x ( lamassa et al .",
