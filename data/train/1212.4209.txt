    "_ aperiodic tiles _ are the set of prototiles which tile the space with their isomorphic images by euclidean motions ( composition of translations , rotations and reflections ) but only in non - periodic way .",
    "there have been many examples of aperiodic tiles and study on them @xcite .",
    "two of well - known examples of aperiodic tiles with simple prototiles up to euclidean motions are penrose tiles and ammann tiles which are uncovered in the mid 70 s .",
    "these sets consist of two prototiles and it has been the smallest number of prototiles which form aperiodic tiles until recently . since then , people have been interested in finding a single prototile for an aperiodic tile .",
    "this problem is coined as ` mono - tile ' problem or ` einstein ' problem ( one stone in german ) .",
    "it had taken quite some time before taylor and socolar announced in 2010 the existence of an aperiodic mono - tile .",
    "their tile is a hexagonal tile with colored decorations and matching rules which can be embedded onto a single tile using shape only .",
    "penrose had found earlier a mono - tile using matching rules which is the reformulation of @xmath2 aperiodic tiles given in @xcite , but in this case it can not be replaced by a single tile using only the shape .",
    "one needs two other tiles to replace the matching rules in the penrose mono - tile .",
    "both of taylor - socolar mono - tile and penrose functional mono - tile are based on hexagonal shape .",
    "but they make different tilings .",
    "it would be interesting to understand the tiling space of penrose mono - tile tilings and compare with the tiling space of taylor - socolar tilings .    around the mid 80 s , shechtman @xcite discovered a quasicrystal with forbidden rotational symmetry of crystal diffraction pattern . after the confirmation of the existence of quasicrystals ,",
    "crystal is redefined as a material whose diffraction patterns consist essentially of bright peaks ( c.f .",
    "since tilings made by aperiodic tiles , which we define as aperiodic tilings , are not periodic , they have served as good models for the structures of quasicrystals when they show the diffraction patterns consisting of pure point diffraction spectrum , i.e. , bragg peaks only without diffuse background .",
    "many examples of known aperiodic tiling like penrose tiling and ammann tiling show the pure point diffraction spectrum .",
    "the objective of this article is investigating whether the aperiodic taylor - socolar tiling , which is a fixed point of a substitution , has pure point diffraction spectrum .    mathematically the pure point diffraction spectrum is quite often studied through the spectrum of the dynamics of the _ dynamical hull _",
    ", that is , a compact space generated by the closure of translation orbits of the tiling .",
    "the two notions of pure pointedness in diffraction and dynamical spectra are equivalent in quite a general setting @xcite . in general tilings ,",
    "almost periodicity of tilings is an equivalent criterion for the pure point spectrum .",
    "when it is restricted on substitution tilings , the almost periodicity can be easily checked by overlap coincidence .",
    "briefly it means the following : when two tiles in a tiling intersect in the interior after shifting one tile by a translation of two other same type tiles in the tiling , one can observe a pair of same type subtiles in the same position in the common interior ( see subsec.[overlap ] ) @xcite .",
    "an aperiodic taylor - socolar tiling itself does not follow tile - substitution rule strictly .",
    "but as it is mentioned in @xcite , half - hexagonal tiles satisfy tile - substitution .",
    "we should note here that the taylor - socolar half - hexagonal tiling is mutually locally derivable from the taylor - socolar tiling .",
    "we consider the taylor - socolar half - hexagonal substitution tiling whose identical image in taylor - socolar tilings belongs to the dynamical hull generated by a repetitive taylor - socolar tiling .",
    "we apply the substitution data on the half - hexagonal tiles of taylor - socolar tiles to the algorithm for checking the overlap coincidence .",
    "the algorithm can be found in @xcite . as the result",
    ", we were able to check that the half - hexagonal taylor - socolar substitution tiling has overlap coincidence .",
    "so we can conclude that the aperiodic taylor - socolar tiling has pure point spectrum .",
    "one can also note that a dynamical hull of taylor - socolar tilings is invariant under the action of rotations of @xmath3 . in the diffraction pattern of a taylor - socolar tiling , we observed six - fold rotational symmetry .",
    "the tiling space of taylor - socolar tilings with the matching rules is slightly bigger than the tiling space of a taylor - socolar substitution tiling .",
    "but it is shown in @xcite that the tilings in the difference have pure point spectrum , computing the total index of cosets .",
    "thus any taylor - socolar tiling under the same matching rules have the pure point spectrum . in the case of self - similar tilings , the discrete part of the diffraction pattern , which is called bragg spectrum , can be characterized in terms of the fourier modules .",
    "there are three types of bragg spectra- limit - periodic , quasiperiodic , limit - quasiperiodic .",
    "the taylor - socolar tilings belong to limit - periodic structure , since the expansion factor is rational .",
    "the fourier module of this structure is an aperiodic structure which is the limit of a sequence of periodic structures ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a substitution tiling with half - hexagonal shapes was known much earlier ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ex.10.1 ) ) .",
    "it is known from @xcite that the substitution point set representing the half - hexagonal substitution tiling is a cut - and - project set and so it has pure point spectrum .",
    "however taylor - socolar tiling differs from @xcite in the sense that we consider a substitution tiling reflecting the aperiodicity of taylor - socolar mono - tile and have to distinguish protiles by their colors .",
    "various other ways to observe the pure point spectrum are pointed out in @xcite .",
    "one can observe that there is an one - to - one almost everywhere map from a dynamical hull of taylor - socolar tilings to a dynamical hull of half - hexagonal substitution tilings .",
    "then this induces the pure point spectrum of taylor - socolar tilings using the result of @xcite .",
    "the other observation would be through checking the modular coincidence which has been introduced in @xcite .",
    "one can see in the figures of @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "15 ) that @xmath4 or @xmath5 type tiles form a sublattice structure of a whole hexagonal lattice with the expansion factor of @xmath6 . it would be sufficient to check if the modular coincidence occurs with these @xmath4 and @xmath5 type tiles .",
    "furthermore @xcite provides a geometrical way to observe the limit - periodic structure in taylor - socolar tilings which shows that tiling can be decomposed into a superposition of periodic structure ( see fig.19 and thm.7.1 in @xcite )",
    ".    therefore the pure point spectrum may not be so surprising in the case of taylor - socolar tilings .",
    "however comparing with the above methods , the biggest advantage of our method is that it is almost _",
    "automatic _ and it can be applied to many variations of taylor - socolar substitutions based on hexagonal lattices , such as penrose mono - tile tiling , with minor changes of the substitution data and investigate the diffraction spectrum of a tiling generated by it .",
    "furthermore it can be applied to substitution tilings whose underlying structures are not even on lattices .",
    "we briefly mention the notions of tilings and tile - substitution in @xmath7 that we use in this paper . for more about tilings and tile - substitutions , see @xcite .",
    "we begin with a set of types ( or colors ) @xmath8 .",
    "a _ tile _ in @xmath7 is defined as a pair @xmath9 where @xmath10 ( the support of @xmath11 ) is a compact set in @xmath7 , which is the closure of its interior , and @xmath12 is the type of @xmath11 .",
    "a _ tiling _ of @xmath7 is a set @xmath13 of tiles such that @xmath14 and distinct tiles have disjoint interiors .",
    "we always assume that any two @xmath13-tiles with the same color are translationally equivalent .",
