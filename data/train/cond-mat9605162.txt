    "it is well known that the time development of reaction diffusion systems in which two types of particles a and b ( ` particles ' and ` antiparticles ' ) annihilate irreversibly is dominated by density fluctuations  @xcite . if an equal number of a and b particles is randomly placed on the sites of a @xmath3-dimensional lattice the densities are asmptotically given by @xmath11 ( for @xmath12 ) whereas a na\"ve approach based on mean - field rate equations predicts @xmath13 .",
    "the slow density decay is due to the asymptotic segregation of particles into regions of purely a or b particles .",

    "if the particles are subject to an external driving force in one direction the repulsion gives rise to superdiffusion with @xmath16 ( for @xmath17 ) , and the density decreases asymptotically as @xmath18 .",

    "in this case @xmath20 is defined through the scaling of the transition probability ( which is a function of @xmath21 ) since the the mean - square displacement for lvy flights with @xmath22 diverges .",

    "other models for particle mixing have been considered in references  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we investigate the a+b - annihilation reaction in a medium with a random velocity field .",

    "similar to the case of purely diffusive particle motion the system segregates after a short time into regions of purely a or b particles . after this initial stage",
    "the density decay is governed by an effective gaussian distribution for the initial density fluctuations . while a simple model based on anisotropic lvy walks already yields the correct exponent for the density decay one has to take many - particle correlations generated by the quenched randomness into account in order to calculate the amplitude .",

    "the more general case @xmath305 with three different disorder couplings @xmath306 , @xmath307 , @xmath308 ( instead of @xmath115 ) can be treated in a similar way at least as long as both species are mobile . for unequal diffusion constants",
    "the fields @xmath120 and @xmath119 are coupled already in the gaussian part of the action .",
    "using similar arguments as in reference  @xcite it can be shown that this effect changes only the amplitude of @xmath260 .",
    "it would be interesting to check the results of this work by simulations . in order to observe the asymptotic long - time behaviour of a disordered system one has to perform configurational averages unless the system size is very large . in the case of a random shear flow the sample - to - sample fluctuations of the density depend on the linear size @xmath309 in the direction perpendicular to the velocity field . since a diffusing particle covers a distance @xmath310 during the time @xmath33 the density measured at time t represents approximatively @xmath311 independent configurations of the flow .",
