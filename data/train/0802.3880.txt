    "low - dimensional strongly correlated electron systems have attracted great attention in the last two decades .",
    "the reason dates back to anderson s proposal @xcite that the @xmath5 version of the hubbard model might carry the basic mechanisms underlying the high - tc superconductivity observed in cuo@xmath0 compounds . despite",
    "that this remains an open issue , the above suggestion fertilized intensive investigations on many related fundamental topics , such us itinerant electron magnetism , mott metal - insulator transitions and quantum critical phenomena . amongst several features of interest , we mention the possibility of realization of spiral @xcite , nagaoka @xcite and resonating - valence - bond ( rvb ) states @xcite , spatially separated phases @xcite and luttinger liquid behavior @xcite , which may present strong deviations from the landau fermi liquid theory .",
    "in this work , we report numerical results of the hubbard model on the doped ab@xmath0 chain away from half filling , which show that its special unit cell topology greatly enriches the phase diagram found in the doped standard linear chain .",
    "in fact , all features mentioned above are shown to be associated with well defined ground state ( gs ) phases of this doped chain . doped ab@xmath0-hubbard chains were previously studied through hartree - fock , quantum monte carlo and exact diagonalization ( ed ) techniques both in the weak and strong coupling limits @xcite , including also the @xmath5 model @xcite using density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) and recurrent variational anstzes , and the infinite - u limit @xcite using ed . in particular , these chains represent an alternative route to reaching two - dimensional quantum physics from one - dimensional systems @xcite . at half filling the ab@xmath0-hubbard chain exhibits a quantum ferrimagnetic gs @xcite , whose magnetic excitations have been studied in detail both in the weak and strong coupling limits @xcite , and in the light of the quantum heisenberg model @xcite .",
    "further studies have considered the anisotropic @xcite and isotropic @xcite critical behavior of the ab@xmath0-quantum - heisenberg model , including its spherical version @xcite , and the statistical mechanics of the ab@xmath0-classical - heisenberg model @xcite .    on the experimental side ,",
