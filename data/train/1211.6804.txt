    "this article heralds a series that presents results from a deeper udf campaign with wfc3/ir completed in september 2012 ( go 12498 , pi ; ellis , hereafter udf12 ) which remedies the above deficiencies by ( i ) substantially increasing the depth of the f105w image ( by @xmath144 in exposure time ) essential for robust rejection of @xmath178.5 sources , ( ii ) increasing the depth of the detection filter f160w ( a 50% increase in exposure time ) and ( iii ) adding a deep image in the f140w filter matching the depth now attained in f160w .",

    "all of the ` y dropouts ' claimed by @xcite have robust f105w detections in our deeper data and lie below @xmath3=8.5 .    in summary ,",
    "only one object claimed to be at @xmath10 from the earlier udf09 analysis remains and that is the final @xmath12-band dropout presented by @xcite at @xmath3=10.3 , udfj-39546284 ( @xmath31udf12 - 3954 - 6384 in table 1 ) .",
    "however , its non - detection in the udf12 f140w data indicates a yet higher redshift of @xmath3=11.9 ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the most significant advance of our campaign is a significant increase ( from 0 to 6 ) in the number of robustly determined udf sources in the redshift range @xmath210 .",
    "a major motivation for the additional f140w filter in our udf12 strategy was to ensure the robust detection in two filters of potential @xmath32 candidates since the flux above 1216   would be visible in both filters .",
    "this is the case for all but one of our udf12 candidates ( table 1 ) .",
    "a major surprise is the non - detection in f140w of udfj-30546284 implying a redshift of @xmath3=11.90 ( figures 1 and 2 ) .",
    "single band detections are naturally less convincing , although udfj-30546284 is confirmed in f160w sub - exposures through udf09 and udf12 , leaving no doubt it is a genuine source .",
    "however , an alternative solution must also be carefully considered . the sharp drop implied by the f140w - f160w @xmath331.5 ( 2@xmath20 )",
    "color precludes any reasonable foreground continuum source ( figure 2 ) but a possible explanation might be the presence of a very strong emission line .",
    "recent wfc3/ir imaging and grism spectroscopy of @xmath02 galaxies has revealed a population of extreme emission line galaxies ( eelgs ) .",
    "@xcite have identified an abundant population of eelgs at @xmath01.7 in the candels survey using purely photometric selection techniques .",
    "spectroscopy of a subset has verified the presence of sources with rest - frame [ o iii ] equivalent widths up to @xmath15 1000   .",
    "independently , @xcite located a similar population in the wisp survey over @xmath34 and comment specifically that such sources could contaminate dropout searches .    following techniques described in @xcite and @xcite , we have simulated model spectra for young low metallicity dust - free galaxies including the contribution from strong nebular lines .",
    "figure 3a shows the expected f105w - f160w color as a function of redshift for starbursts with ages of 1 and 10 myr demonstrating that it is not possible to account for the significant excess flux in f160w from either intense [ o ii ] 3727   at @xmath03.4 or [ o iii ] 5007   at @xmath02.4 .",
    "figure 3b illustrates , for the case of intense [ o iii ] emission that the expected stellar plus nebular emission spectrum of a 10 myr starburst would violate the photometric flux limits provided by the various acs and wfc3/ir broad band non - detections .",
    "if all of the emission in f160w arises from [ o iii ] above a blue @xmath35=-2 stellar continuum , the rest - frame equivalent width would have to be @xmath334500   , beyond that of any known object .",
    "a further difficulty is the absence of the expected lyman @xmath5 emission following a recent keck optical spectrum ( figure 3b ) .",
    "however , although we can find no physically self - consistent starburst model that can simultaneously explain the f160w emission and satisfy our upper limits in figure 3b , only an infrared spectrum would completely eliminate the possibility of some exotic foreground emission line source .",
    "as the source has @xmath36=29.3 , this would be a very challenging observation .",
    "for the remainder of the paper we will interpret this source with caution .",
    "a key issue is whether the declining cosmic star formation which is now well - established over @xmath16 @xcite continues to higher redshift as suggested by the presence of evolved stellar populations with ages of @xmath15200 - 300 myr at @xmath05 - 7 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "three expected , that the star formation history declines more steeply beyond @xmath08 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to @xmath38 .",
    "recently , the clash survey has located several @xmath18.5 candidates@xcite implying star formation rate densities higher than claimed by @xcite at @xmath39 . however , the uncertain search volumes inherent in the lensing method are a major concern .    in figure",
    "[ fig : rho_uv ] we present the implications of the significant increase in the number of @xmath37 sources arising from the udf12 campaign .",
    "our sed - based selection method enables us to consider separately four redshift bins . as a direct determination of the luminosity function at @xmath10",
    "is not yet possible , to estimate the uv luminosity densities for our four detections at @xmath40 we calculate the required redshift evolution in the characteristic luminosity @xmath41 such that a survey of our depth and selection efficiency would recover the number of sources we find .",
    "this calculation is performed assuming simple luminosity evolution from @xmath42 , keeping the luminosity function normalization @xmath43 and faint - end slope @xmath5 fixed at the @xmath42 values measured by @xcite . to reproduce our sample with mean redshift @xmath44 , we find that @xmath45",
    ". the luminosity density can then be estimated by integrating the projected luminosity function parameters to @xmath46ab ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "we find @xmath47 ( figure [ fig : rho_uv ] , blue point ) .",
    "a similar calculation provides @xmath48 from the two @xmath49 detections ( magenta point ) .",
    "the expected udf cosmic variance for @xmath50 is @xmath3340% @xcite . within @xmath51",
    ", we find no candidates .",
    "nonetheless we can use the same methodology to provide an upper limit of @xmath52 ( figure [ fig : rho_uv ] , purple upper limit ) .    considering the putative @xmath53 source , both",
    "its morphology ( figure 1 ) and its luminosity cause us to be cautious , particularly given the paucity of other detections beyond @xmath010.5 .",
    "nonetheless , since the emission line hypothesis is equally difficult to accept ( section 2.1 ) , we estimated the luminosity density using only the source luminosity ( @xmath54ab accounting for igm absorption in f160w , or @xmath55 ) and the udf survey volume @xmath56 .",
    "the resulting luminosity density @xmath57 is thus a lower limit ( figure [ fig : rho_uv ] , red point ) , and conservatively does not include multiplicative effects of selection efficiency or involve extrapolations from the @xmath42 luminosity function .",
    "an additional possibility is that the f160w is contaminated by ly@xmath5 emission .",
    "the additional @xmath3=12 point ( yellow ) illustrates how this limit would be affected for a rest - frame equivalent width of 260 of which half is absorbed by neutral hydrogen .    in summary , the new galaxy sample provided by udf12 has enabled us to present the first meaningful estimate of @xmath58 beyond @xmath59 .",
    "the six galaxies with @xmath60 indicate a modest shortfall in @xmath58 beyond a simple extrapolation of the trend at @xmath7 ( less sharp than that suggested by @xcite , but below ( albeit consistent with ) the cluster results @xcite )",
    ". however , if udfj-30546284 is genuinely a @xmath3=12 galaxy ( and does not have substantial lyman-@xmath5 emission ) then we have witnessed an even more measured decline in @xmath58 to the highest redshift yet probed .",
    "the udf12 data has demonstrated the continued effectiveness of hst to undertake a census of very high redshift galaxies .",
