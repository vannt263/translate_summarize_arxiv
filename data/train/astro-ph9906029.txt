    "probing the statistical properties of the large - scale structure of the universe has a great importance in studying the origin of our universe .",
    "recent galaxy surveys have been revealing the statistical properties of distribution of galaxies on very large scales .",
    "the number density of galaxies are not necessarily proportional to the density of mass , and this ambiguity is known as galaxy biasing problem ( kaiser 1984 ; davis et al .",
    "1985 ; bardeen et al . 1986 ) . since galaxies of different types have different clustering properties ( e.g. , dressler 1980 ; davis & geller 1976 ; giovanelli , haynes , & chincarini 1986 ; santiago & strauss 1992 ; loveday et al .",
    "1996 ; hermit et al . 1996 ; guzzo et al .",
    "1997 ) , not all types of galaxies can simultaneously be unbiased tracers of mass .",
    "this ambiguity is undesirable in extracting cosmological information from the data of galaxy distribution .",
    "the simplest model for the galaxy bias is the _ local _ , _ linear _ bias . in this simple model , the number density field of galaxy with a fixed smoothing scale @xmath1",
    "is assumed to be proportional to density field of mass with a same smoothing scale : @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are density contrast of galaxy and of mass , respectively , with a fixed smoothing length @xmath1 .",
    "this model is viable if ( a ) @xmath5 is dependent only on @xmath6 and ( b ) density contrast of mass is sufficiently small .",
    "the latter condition ( b ) is achieved by considering large scales on which density fluctuations are small enough so that only linear term becomes significant .",
    "the linear coefficient @xmath0 is called as bias parameter .",
    "the bias parameter is often assumed to be a constant , although it can depend on @xmath1 in general .",
    "the effect of nonlinearity should be taken into account when we are interested in nonlinear scales .",
    "on weakly nonlinear scale , this affect the estimation of higher order statistics ( e.g. , fry & gaztaaga 1993 ) .",
    "although the latter condition is reasonably considered to be valid if we are interested in linear scales , the former condition ( a ) is not trivial so far .",
    "the non - triviality of condition ( a ) leads us to a concept of stochastic bias which is recently argued ( dekel & lahav 1998 ; pen 1998 ; tegmark & peebles 1998 ; tegmark & blomley 1998 ; taruya , koyama & soda 1998 ; taruya & soda 1998 ; blanton et al .",
    "1998 ) . in the stochastic biasing scheme ,",
    "@xmath5 is not supposed to be determined solely by @xmath6 , but the scatter in @xmath3-@xmath4 relation is taken into account . in linear regime in which the density contrast of mass @xmath4 is small enough , and is approximated by random gaussian field , the two - point statistics fully characterize the statistics of the scatter . in literatures , the bias parameter @xmath0 and the dimensionless cross correlation @xmath7 are used to characterize the linear stochastic biasing scheme : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are rms density fluctuations of mass and galaxies , respectively .",
    "the bias parameter @xmath0 in the equation ( [ eq1 ] ) is a generalization of the bias parameter in linear deterministic biasing scheme of equation ( [ eq0 ] ) . in deterministic case ,",
    "the cross correlation @xmath7 is always unity . from schwarz inequality",
    ", @xmath7 can not exceed unity and @xmath11 means that biasing is deterministic , @xmath12 .",
    "thus , the deviation from @xmath11 measures the stochasticity .",
    "if the smoothing scale @xmath1 is large enough so that @xmath4 and @xmath3 are considered as bivariate gaussian field , these three parameters @xmath0 , @xmath7 and @xmath13 contain all the statistical information about the stochastic biasing .    in literatures ,",
    "these parameters are sometimes considered as free parameters to be determined by observation . however , if we could know the process of galaxy formation in detail , the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath7 would be derived from some fundamental physical processes .",
    "this is because the bias and its stochasticity come from our ignorance of the galaxy formation .",
    "therefore , there should be some theoretical constraint between @xmath0 and @xmath7 . at first sight",
    ", it seems difficult to find any constraint as we do not exactly know the process of galaxy formation .",
    "this is true especially on small scales where the nonlinear and nonlocal characters of galaxy formation plays an important role on the statistics of galaxy distributions .",
    "this problem is one of the most important issues in astrophysics and much numerical and analytical work is needed ( e.g. , rees & ostriker 1977 ; white & frenk 1991 ; cen & ostriker 1992 ; mo & white 1996 ) .",
    "however , on large scales , such undesirable characters can be expected to be small .",
    "scherrer & weinberg ( 1998 ) , based on the local biasing scheme , showed that the stochasticity actually vanishes on large scales and galaxy autocorrelation function behaves exactly as in deterministic biasing scheme .",
    "dekel & lahav ( 1999 ) also imply the same property based on a specific simple model .    in this paper , based on a general nonlocal method",
    ", we show that stochasticity in fourier space asymptotically vanishes on linear scales under a certain condition , explicitly deriving the relation between the stochastic parameters @xmath0 , @xmath7 and the nonlinear , nonlocal functional form of galaxy formation .",
    "we will show the first coefficient of generalized wiener - hermite functional , which is defined below , of the nonlocal , nonlinear relations of galaxy formation will contribute to the galaxy statistics on large scales , if that coefficient does not vanish .    in the derivation , we can use the technique developed in matsubara ( 1995 ) , in which the diagrammatic methods for the calculation of general nonlocal biasing are introduced .",
    "the diagrammatics are useful especially when the non - gaussianity and/or higher - order correlations are interested in . in this paper , however , we derive the result without employing diagrammatics for self - consistency and for the simplicity of the problem .",
    "the diagrammatics make it easier to generalize the present results to higher - order statistics .    in  2",
    ", we revisit the mathematical methods for nonlinear , and nonlocal bias , which have been developed by matsubara ( 1995 ) .",
    "then we derive the relation between the stochastic bias parameters and the nonlocality of biasing . in  3 , we examine three types of biasing schemes , i.e. , the local lagrangian bias models , the cooperative model , and the peak model , according to the result of  2 . in  4 , we discuss the results and present the conclusions .",
    "in the present paradigm , the distribution of galaxies is determined by initial density fluctuations . whether a galaxy has formed at some place or not should be fully determined by the initial fluctuations . in this sense , the galaxy formation is deterministic , although it nonlinearly , nonlocally , and possibly chaotically depends on initial density fluctuations . in the stochastic biasing scheme ,",
    "this complex features of nonlinearity and nonlocality of the galaxy formation are expressed by phenomenological scatter of local @xmath3@xmath4 relation .",
    "thus , in principle , stochasticity can be determined by nonlinear and nonlocal deterministic processes of galaxy formation .    since both the present mass density field @xmath14 and the density field of galaxies",
    "@xmath15 are determined by initial density fluctuations @xmath16 , they are expressed by functionals @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in the following , instead of the initial fluctuations @xmath16 , we will alternatively use linearly extrapolated density fluctuations @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a linear growth rate .",
    "the variable @xmath21 is simply a linear extrapolation of the evolution of density contrast , regardless of whether or not the small scale fluctuations are actually in linear regime .",
    "the introduction of the linearly extrapolated field is just for convenience and it simply represents the initial density fluctuations . in this notation , one can write the relations as @xmath22,{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ x$}}}),\\qquad     { \\rho_{\\rm g}}({{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ x$ } } } ) = f_{\\rm g}([{\\delta_{\\rm l}}],{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ x$ } } } ) ,     \\label{eq2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we introduce the notation @xmath23 $ ] which means that @xmath17 and @xmath18 are nonlocal ( and , of course , nonlinear ) functionals of @xmath21 .",
    "these functionals also depend on the position , @xmath24 .",
    "it is sometimes more convenient to use the density contrast of @xmath14 and @xmath15 : @xmath25,{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ x$ } } } ) }        { \\langle f_{\\rm m}([{\\delta_{\\rm l}}],{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ x$}}})\\rangle } - 1,\\qquad     { \\delta_{\\rm g}}({{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ x$ } } } ) =      \\frac{f_{\\rm g}([{\\delta_{\\rm l}}],{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ x$ } } } ) }        { \\langle f_{\\rm g}([{\\delta_{\\rm l}}],{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ x$}}})\\rangle } - 1",
    ".     \\label{eq2 - 1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one may want to expand these functional by taylor series of @xmath21 , as in usual perturbative approach .",
    "however , this approach would be useful only if the nonlinearities on _ all _ scales were small , and/or galaxy formation process were linear or quasi - linear .",
    "in reality , however , the galaxy formation process is a highly nonlinear process , and it depends on the nonlinear behavior of mass density field in a very complex way .",
    "thus , we can not use taylor expansion in our treatment below .",
    "alternatively , we will find below that the expansion of these functional by orthogonal functionals , i.e. , generalized wiener - hermite functionals , is useful for our purpose .",

    "in other words , we assume that fourier transform of higher - order kernels @xmath74 are finite in the limit @xmath75 .",
    "note that the expansion ( [ eq14 ] ) is essentially different from usual perturbative approach by taylor expansion of density contrast itself .",
    "instead , we employ the orthogonal expansion for galaxy and mass density fields , and the resulting expression , ( [ eq14 ] ) , can be interpreted as an asymptotic expansion by correlation function , @xmath30 .",

    "our conclusions apply not only to local schemes , but also to nonlocal schemes of galaxy formation .",
    "the difference between local and nonlocal scheme is that local bias generates constant bias factor , while nonlocal bias generates scale - dependent one .",

    "this result is essentially the same which is derived previously in real space ( szalay 1988 ; coles 1993 ) : @xmath148 since @xmath149 .    in usual nonlocal biasing models , the smoothing length @xmath144 is taken to be in nonlinear regime . as we consider linear scales , @xmath150 and",

    "this result is consistent with the work by scherrer & weinberg ( 1998 ) , who showed the local models produce constant bias factor and there is negligible stochasticity on large scales .",
    "examples of local models are density - threshold bias , @xmath151 , where @xmath152 is a step function ( kaiser 1984 ; jensen & szalay 1986 ) , weighted bias , @xmath153 ( catelan et al .",

    "recently , the mo & white model ( mo & white 1996 ) for the clustering of dark matter halos , which is an extension of press - schechter formalism ( press & schechter 1974 ; cole & kaiser 1989 ; bond et al . 1991 ) , is interested in ( e.g. , catelan et al .",
    "1998 ; catelan , matarrese & porciani 1998 ; jing 1998 ; sheth & lemson 1998 ) .",
    "this model is also an example of the lagrangian local biasing model , because the halo density contrast @xmath155 in their model is determined by linear density field @xmath156 which is smoothed on scale @xmath157 .",
    "next , we consider cooperative galaxy formation model introduced by bower et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , in which they showed that a large - scale ( @xmath158 ) , but weak modulation of galaxy luminosities can reconcile the discrepancy between the scdm power spectrum and apm galaxy data ( see also babul & white 1991 ) . as a simple example , they identify sites for galaxy formation as places where density contrast @xmath159 satisfies the following relation @xmath160 where @xmath161 is the density contrast smoothed on a scale @xmath162 , which represent the large - scale modulation , and @xmath163 is a constant which is called as `` the modulation coefficient '' .",
    "this simple model is mathematically equivalent to the standard density - threshold bias model , but for the new field defined by @xmath164 it is easy to see that this new field is just a new density field with a smoothing function @xmath165 , where @xmath146 and @xmath166 are smoothing function for @xmath159 and @xmath161 , respectively .",
    "the bias parameter for the cooperative model in fourier space is similar to equation ( [ eq42 ] ) : @xmath167     \\label{eqc03}\\\\     & = &     \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi } }     \\frac{e^{-{\\nu'}^2/2 } }        { { \\rm erfc}\\left(\\nu'/\\sqrt{2}\\right ) }     \\left [        w_{\\rm s}(ks ) + \\kappa w_{\\rm mod}(k r_{\\rm mod } )     \\right ] ,     \\label{eqc04}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath168 .",

    "as one can see from the figure , there appears the scale - dependence of bias parameter @xmath137 on scales of @xmath162 so that the galaxy clustering on large scales are enhanced by cooperative bias .",

    "( 1993 ) to introduce the cooperative model .",
    "the stochastic parameter @xmath138 is very close to unity except on the modulation scale , where there is weak stochasticity due to scale dependence of bias parameter .",

    "are identified as high peaks of initial density field with a fixed smoothing length ( see bbks ) . treating the constraint properly for density peaks",

    "density extrema are identical to density peaks above some moderate threshold where almost all density extrema would be density peaks .    from the general consideration in the previous section , it is straightforward to obtain parameters @xmath137 and @xmath138 of stochastic bias for this model . from equation ( [ eq20 ] ) and after tedious calculation of this model are finite in large - scale limit .",
    "] , we obtain @xmath188     w_{\\rm s}(ks ) , \\label{eq29}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath189 is a fourier transform of smoothing function for @xmath141 .",
    "other quantities in this expression are defined by @xmath190 hermite polynomial @xmath191 are defined with the normalization , @xmath192 equation ( [ eq29 ] ) explicitly show the scale - dependence of bias parameter in fourier space .",
    "the scale of nonlocality corresponds to @xmath193 , which is of order of smoothing length @xmath144 for obtaining density peaks .",
    "the stochastic parameters @xmath137 , @xmath138 in linear regime for density peaks are derived from the equation ( [ eq23 - 2 ] ) .",
    "assuming @xmath194 , the result is @xmath195 where spectral indices of various kind are defined as follows : @xmath196 equations ( [ eq33 ] ) and ( [ eq34 ] ) describe stochastic parameters in real space .",
    "it is known that if we take both high threshold limit , @xmath197 , and large scale limit , @xmath198 , the correlation function of the peak model reduces to that of linear bias , @xmath199 ( kaiser 1984 ; bbks 1986 ) .",
    "this property is easily confirmed from equation ( [ eq33 ] ) , where @xmath200 for @xmath198 .    in figure 2",
    ", these equations are plotted for @xmath201 with @xmath202 , where we assume cdm power spectrum of bbks , equation ( [ eq37 ] ) , with primordial spectral index @xmath170 and shape parameter @xmath203 and linear amplitude @xmath204 which corresponds to @xmath173 .",
    "the top - hat smoothing function is applied for smoothing @xmath1 , while the gaussian smoothing function is applied for smoothing @xmath144 : @xmath205 the large smoothing lengths , @xmath206 do not correspond to galaxy formation , but rather they correspond to cluster formation , since the cluster of galaxies are density peaks of large smoothing length .",
    "as seen in the figure , once the smoothing scale @xmath1 exceeds the smoothing length @xmath144 , which is the scale of galaxy or cluster formation in this model , the parameter @xmath7 of stochasticity rapidly converges to unity , which means there is no stochasticity above that scale . as",
    "stochasticity vanishes , the bias parameter @xmath0 converges to a constant on large scales .",
    "in this paper we explicitly derive the stochasticity parameters of the bias in linear regime from the nonlocality of the galaxy formation . by using the generalized wiener - hermite functionals",
    ", we can derive the two - point correlation on linear scales which is valid even if the galaxy formation process itself is both nonlinear and nonlocal .",
    "this is in contrast to the usual taylor expansion which can not treat the strongly nonlinear features of galaxy formation .",
    "wiener - hermite functionals are orthogonal functionals and we do not have to assume the smallness of @xmath21 itself , and even do not have to know the exact nonlinear evolution of density contrast , @xmath4 .",
    "instead , we assume only the smallness of correlation function on large scales .",
    "we show that the stochasticity in fourier space does not exist in linear regime ( except for the constant term which comes from the small scale behavior of correlation function ) , and that the biasing parameter in fourier space @xmath97 is given by @xmath207 .",
    "this conclusion is true as long as the galaxy formation process satisfies the relation , @xmath101 , and higher - order kernels @xmath208 ( @xmath147 ) do not increase with scales when @xmath209 .",
    "this property in fourier space is simply because the galaxy - galaxy and galaxy - mass correlation functions can be expressed as convolutions of mass correlation function at lowest order of the expansion by @xmath30 [ equation ( [ eq15 ] ) ] .",
    "a local model of galaxy formation has a constant bias factor , while the nonlocal model has a scale - dependent one , besides mode - mode coupling . in the linear regime where mode - mode coupling is negligible , stochasticity in real space",
    "comes simply from the scale - dependence of the biasing when the galaxy formation is nonlocal and @xmath101 .",
    "thus , naive introduction of stochasticity in fourier mode in the linear regime should be avoided .",
    "one can not introduce stochasticity in fourier mode in the linear regime simply because of the lack of knowledge about galaxy formation .",
    "if there is any stochasticity in fourier mode in the linear regime , it means that there are exotic process in the galaxy formation which does not come solely from the initial density field and such process should be correlated on linear scales , unless galaxy formation process has a special form to satisfy @xmath96 .",
    "such kind of exotic process is not likely , at least in the present framework of the standard theory of structure formation in the universe .",
    "we should note our analyses are restricted to the linear regime . in the nonlinear regime",
    ", there are mode coupling from both nonlinearity of density evolution and nonlinearity of galaxy formation and it makes the fourier mode stochastic . in the region where stochasticity is prominent , the nonlinear density evolution , which is difficult to track analytically , is also prominent , so that the phenomenological approach of stochastic bias should be effectively applied in nonlinear regime ( dekel & lahav 1998 ) .    in strongly nonlinear regime ,",
    "phenomenological approach by the ( hyper ) extended perturbation theory ( colombi et al .",
    "1997 ; scoccimarro & frieman 1998 ) can shed light on how nonlinearity makes cross correlation @xmath7 deviate from unity .",
    "in this theory , the higher order cumulants of mass density field is given by @xmath210 , where @xmath211 is a constant predicted by tree - level perturbation theory , and @xmath212 .",
    "although this theory contains an extrapolation of weakly nonlinear result to strongly nonlinear regime , it phenomenologically describe the numerical results . in strongly nonlinear regime ,",
    "a mere averaging and cumulant are approximately equivalent in this ansatz : @xmath213 .",
    "thus , if @xmath214 , one can obtain @xmath215 and @xmath216 . finally , one has @xmath217 .",
    "this value of @xmath7 depends on the scale , and departs significantly from unity on small scales .",
    "the conclusion that the stochasticity is weak on linear scales is good news for determining the redshift distortion parameter @xmath218 on linear scales from a redshift survey .",
    "the linear redshift distortion of power spectrum is given by , in the plane - parallel limit ( kaiser 1987 ; pen 1998 ) , @xmath219     p_{\\rm g}(k ) , \\label{eq39}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath220 is redshift - space power spectrum of galaxies , and @xmath221 is a direction cosine of the angle between the wave vector @xmath114 and the line of sight [ see hamilton ( 1992 ) for an expression for two - point correlation function and szalay , matsubara & landy ( 1998 ) for its generalization to non - plane - parallel case ] .",
    "since we see @xmath222 on linear scales except some special cases , we do not need to fit @xmath7 from the observation when we use only the linear redshift distortion .",
    "however , the previous analyses so far usually assume the bias parameter @xmath0 as a scale - independent constant .",
    "this assumption is justified if the scale of nonlocality of galaxy formation is actually below the linear scale .",
    "if it is not , the scale - dependence of @xmath223 should also be determined by observation ( or by theories , if possible ) .",
    "the forthcoming large - scale redshift surveys will reveal the galaxy distribution especially on linear scales , on which we have not had sufficient data so far .",
    "as shown in this paper , the linear clustering properties are analytically tractable even when the galaxy formation itself is a too complex phenomenon to analytically track .",
    "the exploration of linear - scale galaxy distribution can overcome our ignorance of detailed galaxy formation processes , and will give a great insight on the primordial features of our universe .",
