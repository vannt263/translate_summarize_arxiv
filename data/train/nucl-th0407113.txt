    "the study of the nn interaction has played a dominant role in the theory of nuclear structure  @xcite . at low energies",
    "the corresponding scattering phase shifts can be best parameterized in terms of an effective range expansion ( ere )  @xcite .",
    "this expansion can be suitably generalized for all partial waves and coupled channels ( for a review see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein . ) .",
    "the calculation of the low energy threshold parameters is straightforward in potential scattering , and can be extracted from the asymptotic form of the wave function computed order by order in a low energy expansion , but unlike potentials the ere parameters are not subjected to off - shell ambiguities .",
    "benchmark descriptions of nn scattering data have been obtained by the phase shift partial wave analysis ( pwa ) of the nijmegen group carried out a decade ago  @xcite and further parameterizations through high quality potentials  @xcite . for channels involving central waves low energy threshold parameters have been determined routinely and for the high quality potentials this calculation has been undertaken in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . however , a detailed and systematic determination of these threshold parameters in non central partial waves is , to our knowledge , still missing .",
    "almost parallel with the previous developments there has been in the last decade a renewed interest on the nn interaction based on the application of lagrangian effective field theories ( eft ) methods , motivated by weinberg s ideas  @xcite and pursued by many others  @xcite to attempt a realistic description of np scattering data .",
    "this approach has open promising perspectives in the theory of nuclear systems ( for a recent review see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . actually , the reference database most modern eft calculations are confronted with are those of the nijmegen group  @xcite . moreover , the determination of the low energy constants ( lec s ) appearing in the eft lagrangian depends on the regularization scale and also on the short distance behaviour of the long distance chiral potential due to one , two and higher pion exchanges .",
    "the results for the scattering matrix and in particular for the low energy threshold parameters should , of course , be independent on the renormalization prescription . in the absence of explicit pion exchanges the eft approach can be mapped into an effective range expansion  @xcite , and the lec s can , in principle , be deduced from the physical threshold parameters for a given renormalization scale .",
    "when long distance chiral potentials generated by successive pion exchanges are included the situation becomes much more involved , particularly if those potentials can not be treated perturbatively .",
    "recently , we have proposed a regularization scheme  @xcite where the lec s can also be deduced directly from the low energy threshold parameters beyond perturbation theory within a variable s - matrix approach  @xcite .",
    "the implementation of such an approach requires an explicit knowledge of the threshold parameters as input . in practice",
    ", most eft calculations fit their results to the nijmegen database  @xcite in a given energy window in terms of the lec s within a given regularization scheme and at a given scale , and low energy threshold parameters could be determined afterwards . under these circumstances",
    "we think it of interest to provide in any case these low energy threshold parameters as deduced _ directly _ from the high quality potentials  @xcite in all partial waves .",
    "in this paper we determine the low energy parameters of the nijmii and reid93 potentials  @xcite for all partial waves with @xmath8 . to this end",
    "we use the variable s - matrix approach ( for a review with many references see e.g. ref .",
    "an application of the variable phase approach in the context of eft in the singlet @xmath9 channel can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ) where the s - matrix can be computed by solving a non - linear system of first order differential equations representing the variation of the s - matrix under a continuous switching on of the potential starting from a trivial potential ( see below for a sketchy derivation ) . by implementing a low energy expansion",
    "one obtains a set of first order coupled differential equations from which the low energy threshold parameters can be obtained as asymptotic values at long distances for any partial wave . the method is stable and whenever comparison can be made reproduces previous known results for the ere parameters in central waves .",

    "[ sec : smatrix ] we introduce our notation for scattering amplitudes , partial wave expansion m - matrix and scaled m - matrix , which enable to take the low energy expansion in a particularly transparent and clean way .",
