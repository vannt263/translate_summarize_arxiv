    "the no cloning theorem of wootters and zurek @xcite and dieks @xcite prohibits the creation of perfect copies of nonorthogonal quantum states .",
    "this famous result has profound implications for quantum communications , e.g. the security of quantum cryptography @xcite .",
    "it is also well known that any set of orthogonal states can be perfectly copied in principle .",
    "however it is not known how well this can be achieved if there are restrictions on the set of possible quantum operations .",
    "a common scenario in quantum information processing and communications is where a multiparticle , possibly entangled state is distributed among a number of spatially separated parties .",
    "each of these parties can perform arbitrary local operations on the subsystems they possess .",
    "however , they can only send classical information to each other .",
    "when this is the case , the parties are restricted to performing local ( quantum ) operations and classical communication ( locc ) .",
    "there has been a considerable amount of activity devoted to understanding the properties of locc operations .",
    "certain specific quantum information processing tasks , such as entanglement distillation and , more recently , state discrimination , have been the focus of a particularly large amount of attention with respect to the locc constraint . in this paper , we investigate the problem of copying orthogonal , entangled , quantum states under these conditions .    quantum copying and quantum state discrimination are closely related operations @xcite . in the study of state discrimination under the locc constraint",
    ", it has been found that any pair of orthogonal , entangled , pure , bipartite states can be perfectly discriminated by locc @xcite .",
    "this is not generally possible for more than two states .",
    "also , it has been found that any two nonorthogonal , entangled , pure , bipartite states can be optimally discriminated by locc @xcite .",
    "again , this is not generally possible for more than two states @xcite .",
    "we see that the locc constraint imposes restrictions on the number of states for which certain discrimination tasks are possible .",
    "given that copying is closely related to state discrimination",
    ", we might imagine that the locc constraint could also affect the number of states for which certain copying procedures are possible .",
    "we will show in this paper that this is indeed the case .",
    "in fact , we shall see that some of the restrictions on locc copying are , if we wish to use entanglement efficiently , more severe than those on locc state discrimination .",
    "this will turn out to be a consequence of the fact that , when copying states by locc , there are certain factors we must take into account that do not apply to locc state discrimination . in locc state discrimination , the original state is typically destroyed .",
    "this is of no concern , since we only wish to know the state , not preserve it .",
    "however , in copying the state , not only do we wish to preserve the original state , we also wish to imprint it onto another system initialised in a ` blank ' state . if we restrict ourselves to performing locc copying and the states we wish to copy",
    "are entangled , then the blank state must be entangled also .",
    "if this were not the case , then the copying procedure would create entanglement , which is well known to be impossible under locc @xcite .",
    "it was recently discovered by ghosh et al @xcite , in an independent work , that some sets of orthogonal , maximally entangled states can be copied by locc and with a maximally entangled blank state .",
    "these authors considered locc copying of bell states .",
    "the bell states , which are maximally entangled states of two qubits , each contain one ebit of entanglement .",
    "these authors showed that locc copying of any two bell states is possible with a blank state containing one ebit of entanglement .",
    "they found , however , that to copy all four bell states requires one further ebit of entanglement .",
    "this is still less than the two further ebits that would be required to perform an arbitrary operation on the four qubits comprising the states @xmath2 and @xmath3 by locc @xcite .    in this paper , we obtain numerous results which relate to the problem of copying pure , bipartite , orthogonal , entangled states by locc . throughout",
    ", we are interested in making perfect copies deterministically . in section [ sec2 ] , we set up the copying problem in general terms .",
    "in doing so , we acknowledge the fact that an locc operation may , in principle , involve an unlimited number of rounds of classical communication . as such , the operation may become unwieldy in formal terms .",
    "rather than deal with this possibility directly , we take an alternative approach based on the fact that locc operations form a subset of the set of separable operations . the form of a general separable operation",
    "is well known and more convenient to work with .    for the reasons we gave above , the locc copying procedure must use an entangled blank state .",
    "entanglement is a precious resource in quantum information processing .",
    "consequently , it is highly desirable that entanglement is used efficiently and if , at all possible , conserved by the operation . to investigate this matter fully",
    ", we require a measure of entanglement .",
    "the problem of quantifying entanglement is central to quantum information theory . for pure , bipartite states in the asymptotic limit , where many copies of the states are available , a unique measure of entanglement",
    "can be provided @xcite .",
    "this is the entropy of entanglement .",
    "however , in the scenario considered in this paper , we only have one copy of each of the states to be processed : the state to be copied and the blank state .    in this `",
    "one - shot ' scenario , there exist pairs of incomparable states , for which one can not unambiguously decide whether the entanglement of one state is greater than , less than or equal to that of the other . ideally , we would like the entanglement of the blank state to equal that of the most entangled of the states to be copied , as this would represent the most efficient use of entanglement .",
    "however , our desire to use entanglement efficiently leads us to , in general , account for the possibility of incomparability of the blank state and some of the states to be copied .",
    "we show that when all of the states to be copied are non - maximally entangled , accounting for this possible incomparability leads to scenarios where , although the locc copying procedure is possible , the blank state can not be directly transformed into the state to be copied by locc .",
    "instead , the original copy of the state serves as an entanglement catalyst @xcite which facilitates the copying procedure .",
    "this point is illustrated in the simple case where we wish to copy just one state .    in section [ sec3 ]",
    ", we analyse in detail the problem of locally copying @xmath4 orthogonal , entangled states with @xmath0 dimensional subsystems .",
    "the blank state is also taken to be an entangled state whose subsystems are d dimensional .",
    "we focus in particular on the situation where one of the states to be copied is maximally entangled .",
    "this simplifies the problem in many respects .",
    "firstly , the possibility of catalytic copying , with its attendant complications , does not arise , since a maximally entangled state can not serve as an entanglement catalyst @xcite .",
    "consequently , the blank state must be maximally entangled also .",
    "secondly , we show that the local kraus operators for a separable copying operation must be proportional to unitary operators if they are to copy a maximally entangled state .",
    "this is very helpful , since any separable operation whose kraus operators have this property can be performed by locc .",
    "indeed , we find that we may , without loss of generality , take the entire copying operation to consist of just two local unitary operations , with one being carried out by each party , and no classical communication .",
    "this implies that if one of the states to be copied is maximally entangled , then they must all be maximally entangled .",
    "we then use the convenient form of these operators to obtain a general necessary and sufficient condition for locc copying of @xmath4 @xmath0 dimensional maximally entangled states with a maximally entangled blank state .",
    "this condition is difficult to solve for arbitrary @xmath4 and @xmath0 .",
    "however , it can be solved exactly for @xmath5 and all @xmath0 . in section [ sec4 ] ,",
    "we present this solution in detail and describe a number of its consequences . in particular , we find that for @xmath1 , any pair of maximally entangled , bipartite pure states can be copied using the same locc operation and a maximally entangled blank state .",
    "however , we also show that for any @xmath0 which is not prime , there exist such pairs for which this copying operation is impossible .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec5 ] with a discussion of our results .",
    "let us consider the following scenario , depicted in figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "we have two parties , alice and bob , occupying spatially separated laboratories @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively .",
    "alice and bob each have two @xmath0 dimensional quantum systems .",
    "alice s systems will be labelled 1 and 3 while bob s will be labelled 2 and 4 . associated with each of these systems",
    "is a copy of the @xmath0 dimensional hilbert space @xmath8 .",
    "the tensor product hilbert spaces of alice s and bob s pairs will be denoted by @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively .",
    "alice and bob also possess ancillary quantum systems enabling them to carry out arbitrary local quantum operations .",
    "they also share a two - way classical channel allowing unlimited classical communication between them .",
    "consider now a set of entangled , bipartite , pure states @xmath11 , where @xmath12 . throughout this article ,",
    "when @xmath13 , we shall take the @xmath2 to be orthogonal .",
    "this implies that , without the locc restriction , the states could be perfectly copied .",
    "particles 1 and 2 are initially prepared in one of these states although alice and bob do not know which one .",
    "particles 3 and 4 are initially prepared in the known , bipartite , blank state @xmath14 .",
    "alice and bob aim to perform the transformation @xmath15 is represented mathematically by a completely positive , linear , trace non - increasing map from the set of linear operators on @xmath16 to itself ( when the input and output hilbert spaces are identical , which is the case in the present context . )",
    "let us denote such a map by @xmath17 and consider a quantum system whose initial state is described by a density operator @xmath18 .",
    "this map transforms the density operator according to @xmath19    a particularly useful representation of quantum operations is the operator - sum representation : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is some positive integer . for @xmath17 to be a physically realisable quantum operation , the @xmath22 , which are known as the kraus operators , must be linear operators that satisfy @xmath23{0.3ex}{0.1ex}}}},\\ ] ] where @xmath24{0.3ex}{0.1ex}}}}$ ] is the identity operator on @xmath16 .",
    "the equality holds when the map is trace preserving for all states , in which case the quantum operation is deterministic for all states .",
    "if the operation is not trace preserving for a particular initial state , then it can only be implemented with probability equal to the trace of the final state .",
    "whether or not the operation has been implemented can be always be determined in principle , and this may be viewed as a generalised measurement . more generally , any experiment implements a trace preserving sum of trace non - increasing quantum operations . the operation that has actually been carried out",
    "can always , in principle , be determined , and it formally corresponds to a particular outcome of a generalised measurement .",
    "there are many particular kinds of quantum operation of special interest . in the present context ,",
    "two kinds are particularly important .",
    "these are the separable operations @xcite and the locc procedures . in a separable operation acting on two systems in spatially separated laboratories @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the @xmath22 may be written as @xmath25 here , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are local kraus operators acting on @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively . in this context , we may refer to the @xmath22 as the global kraus operators .",
    "locc procedures are sequences of trace preserving local quantum operations carried out in the individual laboratories , interspersed with rounds of classical communication .",
    "the information received at each laboratory is used to control the subsequent local operation at the same location .",
    "the number of rounds of classical communication can be arbitrarily large and , consequently , locc procedures can be difficult to work with . however , the set of such procedures is a subset of the set of separable operations .",
    "it follows that separability is only a necessary condition for a quantum operation to be implementable by locc @xcite .",
    "it is not sufficient .",
    "still , the fact that the global kraus operators for separable operations have the simple form shown in eq . often makes such operations a useful starting point for investigating problems relating to locc .",
    "see , for example , @xcite .      due to the limitations on the locc manipulation of entanglement ,",
    "it is a non - trivial matter to determine the set of blank states which enable one to copy , by locc , even a single , known state @xmath28 . in principle",
    ", the conditions under which this is possible can be obtained using nielsen s theorem @xcite .",
    "this result specifies the conditions under which one pure , bipartite , entangled state can be transformed into another by deterministic locc .",
    "nielsen s theorem involves the concept of majorization , which we will briefly review .",
    "consider two real , @xmath29-component vectors @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath32 and @xmath33 be the vectors obtained from @xmath34 and @xmath35 by arranging their components in non - increasing order .",
    "the vector @xmath35 is said to majorize the vector @xmath34 if @xmath36 for all @xmath37 and with the equality holding for @xmath38 .",
    "this majorization relation is usually written as @xmath39 or @xmath40 .",
    "consider now two pure bipartite states @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "these may be written in schmidt decomposition form as @xmath43 , where @xmath44 and where the maximum subsystem hilbert space dimension is @xmath29 .",
    "the schmidt vectors @xmath45 may , without loss of generality , be taken to have real , non - negative components .",
    "nielsen s theorem states that @xmath41 can be transformed by deterministic locc into @xmath42 if and only if @xmath46    returning to problem of locc copying , let the states @xmath28 and @xmath3 have the schmidt vectors @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "we wish to implement the transformation @xmath49 by locc .",
    "nielsen s theorem implies that this will be possible if and only if @xmath50 clearly , this copying transformation will be possible if the transformation @xmath51 is possible by locc , i.e. , if @xmath52 .",
    "however , what if @xmath51 is impossible by locc ? when @xmath3 can not be transformed into @xmath28 by deterministic locc , there appear at first sight to be two cases to consider , corresponding to whether or not @xmath53 is possible by locc .",
    "however , we shall now show that the possibility of the locc transformation @xmath53 , when combined with our assumptions that the copying transformation in eq . is possible by locc and that the transformation @xmath53 is nt , leads to a contradiction .    to do this , it is useful to introduce another relation between two vectors , the trumping relation .",
    "consider two real vectors @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "if there exists a real vector @xmath54 such that @xmath55 then we say that ` @xmath35 trumps @xmath34 ' and write this relation as @xmath56 or @xmath57 . from eq .",
    ", we clearly see that @xmath58 the trumping relation is weaker than the majorization relation : that is , if @xmath40 then @xmath56 , but not necessarily vice versa .",
    "we are assuming that @xmath53 is possible by locc , which implies that @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , @xmath60    we shall now use the following theorem due to jonathan and plenio @xcite : if @xmath56 and @xmath61 , then @xmath62 . combining this result with eqs . and",
    ", we see that @xmath63 .",
    "when this is so , it follows that @xmath52 and , by nielsen s theorem , that the transformation @xmath51 is actually possible by locc , which contradicts our premise .",
    "the remaining possibility is that both @xmath51 and @xmath53 are impossible to perform by locc .",
    "when this is the case , the states @xmath28 and @xmath3 are said to be incomparable .",
    "even though incomparable states can not be transformed into each other by locc , there is the possibility that the transformation in is possible .",
    "when this is so , @xmath64 , which is unchanged by the copying procedure , is said to act as a catalyst for the transformation @xmath65 .",
    "the problem of finding , for a general state @xmath28 , the set of blank states @xmath3 for which @xmath28 can be copied by entanglement catalysis is a challenging task .",
    "this is due to the fact that no analytical way of ordering the schmidt coefficients of a general tensor product of two states has yet been discovered .",
    "nevertheless , by numerical methods , one can easily check for particular states whether or not the majorization relation in eq .",
    "is satisfied .",
    "one can then search for pairs of pure , bipartite entangled states such that one can not be transformed into another directly but for which the transformation is possible with a catalyst .",
    "a specific example of catalytic copying , which we obtained in this way , is as follows .",
    "consider the case of @xmath66 and a state @xmath28 with schmidt coefficients @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "consider also a blank state @xmath3 with schmidt coefficients @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "for these two states , one can readily verify using nielsen s theorem that the transformation @xmath71 is impossible by locc while the transformation @xmath72 locc copying of a pure orthogonal set including a maximally entangled state ---------------------------------------------------------------------------",
    "returning to the problem of locally copying the @xmath4 states @xmath2 , recall that we require the copying operation to be separable .",
    "this implies that the global kraus operators will have the form shown in eq .",
    ", where the @xmath73 and @xmath74 act on @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively . in terms of these operators , the copying transformation will have the form @xmath75 are some complex coefficients that satisfy @xmath76 .",
    "separability of the copying operation is , as we have noted above , only a necessary and not a sufficient condition for locc copying .",
    "however the combination of the separability condition with specific features relating to particular sets of states can lead us to exact necessary and sufficient conditions for locc copying .",
    "the remainder of this paper is devoted to investigating the locc copying problem for a class of such sets .",
    "these are sets where at least one of the states to be copied is maximally entangled .",
    "for the sake of definiteness , let the state @xmath77 be maximally entangled .",
    "it is known @xcite that a maximally entangled state can not serve as a catalyst .",
    "therefore , the transformation @xmath78 must be possible by locc . since we are restricting ourselves to blank states of a pair of @xmath0 dimensional particles , it follows from nielsen s theorem that the blank state is necessarily maximally entangled also .",
    "this section is devoted to determining the conditions under which the @xmath2 can be copied by locc when both @xmath77 and the blank state @xmath3 are maximally entangled .",
    "in the first part of this section , we will see how the requirements of our operation have interesting implications for the form of the local kraus operators in eq . .",
    "we will then obtain the general necessary and sufficient conditions under which our desired operation is physically possible .",
    "to begin , let @xmath79 be an orthonormal basis for the single particle hilbert space @xmath8 .",
    "we will frequently work with the following reference maximally entangled state in @xmath80 : @xmath81 , for particles @xmath82 where @xmath83 .",
    "as such , it is convenient to adopt a simpler notation for these states .",
    "define @xmath84 where @xmath85 .",
    "each value of @xmath86 must correspond to unique values of @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "this can be achieved , for example , by letting @xmath89 with @xmath90 .",
    "more generally , we will use greek subscripts to index elements of this basis according to the same formula as for @xmath86 .",
    "the fact that the state @xmath77 is maximally entangled implies that there exists a unitary operator @xmath91 on @xmath8 such that @xmath92{0.3ex}{0.1ex}}}}^{2 } )    state , we replace the superscripts 1 and 2 with 3 and 4 respectively .",
    "the blank state @xmath3 is also maximally entangled , so there exists a unitary operator @xmath93 on @xmath8 such that @xmath94{0.3ex}{0.1ex}}}}^{4})|{\\psi}^{34}_{max}{\\rangle}.\\ ] ]    we now proceed to show that , without loss of generality , the @xmath73 and @xmath74 in eq .",
    "may be taken to be , up to multiplicative coefficients , unitary . to do this",
    ", we note that the most general locc procedure consists of an arbitrarily long sequence of local operations in alice s and bob s laboratories interspersed with rounds of classical communication .",
    "the entire locc operation is initiated by one party .",
    "for the sake of definiteness , and without loss of generality , let this party be alice .",
    "alice implements a deterministic local operation on her system .",
    "this operation , which is trace preserving , may be a sum of trace non - increasing operations in which alice obtains ( classical ) information about which of these operations was carried out .",
    "the entire operation is then a generalised measurement .",
    "if it is , then the measurement result is communicated to bob . upon receiving this ,",
    "bob implements a local operation corresponding to this result .",
    "he then communicates a description of his operation to alice ( if she does not already know the operation he will perform given the classical information she sent him ) together with any measurement results and the process can repeat an arbitrarily large number of times .",
    "the crucial point is the fact that if alice and bob begin with the state @xmath95 , which is a maximally entangled state of the pairs ( 1,3 ) and ( 2,4 ) , then the locc copying procedure will produce the state @xmath96 , which is also a maximally entangled state of these pairs of particles .",
    "no locc procedure can transform a maximally entangled state into a non - maximally entangled state , and then into another maximally entangled state .",
    "it follows that each step in their locc copying procedure can do no more than transform one maximally entangled state of these pairs of particles into another .",
    "so , let @xmath97 and @xmath98 be maximally entangled states of the pairs ( 1,3 ) and ( 2,4 )",
    ". we may write these states as @xmath99 and the @xmath100 are unitary operators acting on @xmath9 .",
    "we will now investigate the properties of a local operation in one laboratory that transforms @xmath97 into @xmath98 .",
    "for the sake of definiteness , we let this operation be carried out by alice in her laboratory @xmath6 .",
    "the following argument applies equally well if the operation were to be carried out by bob .",
    "alice carries out a local operation , which we shall denote by @xmath101 .",
    "this takes the form of a completely positive , linear , trace non - increasing map on the space of linear operators on @xmath102 . interpreting this operation as corresponding to a generalised measurement outcome",
    ", whose probability is @xmath103 for the initial state @xmath97 , this operation must produce the state @xmath98 according to @xmath104{0.3ex}{0.1ex}}}}^{24}(|{\\chi}_{1}{\\rangle}{\\langle}{\\chi}_{1}|)=p|{\\chi}_{2}{\\rangle}{\\langle}{\\chi}_{2}|.\\ ] ] let us now define the following operation on particles 1 and 3 whose action on an arbitrary density operator @xmath105 of these particles is @xmath106 from eqs . , and we see that @xmath107{0.3ex}{0.1ex}}}}^{24}(|{\\psi}^{12}_{max}{\\rangle}{\\langle}{\\psi}^{12}_{max}|{\\otimes}|{\\psi}^{34}_{max}{\\rangle}{\\langle}{\\psi}^{34}_{max}| ) \\nonumber \\\\&=&p|{\\psi}^{12}_{max}{\\rangle}{\\langle}{\\psi}^{12}_{max}|{\\otimes}|{\\psi}^{34}_{max}{\\rangle}{\\langle}{\\psi}^{34}_{max}|.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we will now proceed to show that the above transformation implies that @xmath108{0.3ex}{0.1ex}}}}^{13}({\\cdot}){{{\\sf 1 \\hspace{-0.3ex } \\rule{0.1ex}{1.52ex}\\rule[-.01ex]{0.3ex}{0.1ex}}}}^{13}.\\ ] ] to do so , let us expand eq . in terms of the @xmath109 basis states , which gives @xmath110 where we have omitted the overall factor of @xmath111 .",
    "acting on the ( 2,4 ) states to the left with @xmath112 and to the right with @xmath113 and making use of their orthonormality , we obtain @xmath114 an arbitrary linear operator @xmath115 acting on @xmath116 may be written as @xmath117 having the matrix elements @xmath118 in the @xmath119 basis . from eq . and the linearity of @xmath120",
    ", it readily follows that @xmath121 since this is true for any linear operator @xmath115 on @xmath116 , we require that eq .",
    "is true .    combining this with eq .",
    ", we see that alice s operation has the form @xmath122 in this local operation , the kraus operators may be taken to be @xmath123 , which are clearly proportional to unitary operators",
    ". furthermore , alice s overall local kraus operators @xmath73 are simply the products of the local kraus operators corresponding to the elementary steps she carries out in the entire locc procedure",
    ". these must also be proportional to unitary operators , since the product of any number of unitary operators is also a unitary operator .",
    "clearly , the above argument also applies if the elementary step is carried out by bob .",
    "we are therefore led to the following conclusion : the local kraus operators @xmath73 and @xmath74 for the entire locc procedure are , up to overall multiplicative coefficients , unitary .",
    "these coefficients are real and non - negative since they are , from our above definition of the elementary step local kraus operators , products of the square roots of probabilities .",
    "we may then write @xmath124 here , @xmath125 and @xmath126 are unitary operators on @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively and the @xmath127 are the real , non - negative coefficients which satisfy @xmath128 as a consequence of eq . and the fact that our locc procedure is trace preserving .",
    "this has several important consequences that we can take advantage of .",
    "the first is the fact that any separable quantum operation whose local kraus operators have this property can be carried out by locc .",
    "this can be done in the following way . at one of the laboratories ,",
    "say @xmath6 , a random variable @xmath129 with @xmath21 possible values @xmath130 and probability distribution @xmath131 is generated .",
    "on obtaining the result @xmath130 , alice carries out the local unitary operation @xmath125 .",
    "she also communicates the value of @xmath129 to bob , who then proceeds to implement the transformation @xmath126 .",
    "the fact that the global kraus operators @xmath22 are , up to multiplicative coefficients , unitary implies that each one can be implemented deterministically .",
    "furthermore , they must each carry out the desired locc copying transformation , for each of the states to be copied .",
    "otherwise , the final state would be mixed .",
    "this implies that a necessary and sufficient condition for implementing the copying transformation is that the copying procedure can be implemented by a single global kraus operator @xmath132 , where @xmath133 and @xmath134 are unitary . when this is the case , the complex coefficients @xmath135 in eq . , where we may drop the index @xmath136 , have unit modulus . implementing these observations ,",
    "eq . becomes @xmath137 for some angles @xmath138 .",
    "the fact that @xmath139 and @xmath140 are unitary implies that the states @xmath2 must all be maximally entangled .",
    "the reason for this is that , if any non - maximally entangled state @xmath2 could be perfectly copied , then particles 3 and 4 , initially prepared in the maximally entangled state @xmath3 , would be left in the non - maximally entangled state @xmath2 .",
    "this is impossible to achieve with a pair of local unitary operators .    in the remainder of this section",
    ", we shall use the above findings to obtain a general necessary and sufficient condition for locc copying , with a maximally entangled blank state , of the states @xmath2 when they are orthonormal and maximally entangled .",
    "we saw above that , if @xmath77 is maximally entangled , then the @xmath2 are all maximally entangled . consequently , we may write all of these states in the same form as we did for @xmath77 in eq . , that is , as @xmath141{0.3ex}{0.1ex}}}}^{2})|{\\psi}_{max}^{12}{\\rangle},\\ ] ] for some unitary operators @xmath142 on @xmath8 . again",
    ", when considering the particle pair ( 3,4 ) in one of these states , we will change the superscripts 1 and 2 to 3 and 4 respectively .",
