    "understanding the phase diagram of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is one of the main goals of heavy - ion collision experiments . from lattice",
    "qcd calculations , it is found that the hadron - quark phase transition is a smooth crossover at zero baryon chemical potential  @xcite , corresponding to the matter at the top energy of relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) . at finite baryon chemical potential as expected in lower collision energies , various theoretical models , e.g. , the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model  @xcite , have shown that the hadron - quark phase transition can be a first - order one . in order to search for the signal of the qcd critical point , which lies at the phase boundary between the smooth crossover transition to the first - order transition ,",
    "great efforts have been made in several experimental programs . among them , the phase i of the beam - energy scan ( bes ) program has been carried out , and the phase ii of bes program as well as the compressed baryonic matter ( cbm ) program at the international facility for antiprotons and ion research ( fair ) are being planned .",
    "the rhic - bes i has led to many exciting findings , and among them the elliptic flow ( @xmath0 ) splitting between particles and their antiparticles has attracted considerable theoretical attentions .",
    "for example , the @xmath0 splitting can be attributed to the larger @xmath0 for transported quarks than that for produced quarks , or similarly , their different rapidity dependencies  @xcite , hydrodynamic evolution of the qgp at finite baryon chemical potential  @xcite , and the smaller radial flow of particles than their antiparticles  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 splitting between @xmath1 and @xmath2 can also be attributed to the electric quadrupole moment in the produced quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) due to the effect from the chiral magnetic wave  @xcite and their similar dynamics in the hadronic matter .    in our previous studies",
    "@xcite by introducing mean - field potentials in both the partonic phase  @xcite and the hadronic phase  @xcite of a multiphase transport ( ampt ) model , we reproduced the relative elliptic flow splitting between protons and antiprotons as well as kaons and antikaons at only the lowest energy of rhic - bes , i.e. , 7.7 gev .",
    "based on our previous models , we have made further modifications of the ampt model in addition to the incorporation of the mean - field potential , such as applying the mix - event coalescence algorithm in the hadronization process and correcting the charge conservation in the hadronic phase . in the present study , we use this extended ampt model to explore the collision energy dependence of elliptic flow splitting between particles and their antiparticles in heavy ion collisions .",

    "[ potential ] , we review the partonic mean - field potentials based on a 3-flavor njl model and the hadronic mean - field potentials from effective lagrangians . the extensions made on the original ampt model as well as the structure of the extended ampt model are briefly described in sec .",

    "to include the mean - field potentials for both partons and hadrons in relativistic heavy - ion collisions , we have made extensive modifications to the string melting version of the ampt model  @xcite .",
    "the original string melting version has been successfully used to describe the charge particle multiplicity , the collective flow , and the dihadron correlations in heavy - ion collisions at the top energies at rhic and lhc  @xcite , where the mean - field potentials for particles and their antiparticles are not included in either the partonic phase or the hadronic phase as their effects are less important than partonic and hadronic scatterings on the collision dynamics .",
    "however , the mean - field effects become non - negligible in heavy - ion collisions at energies of the rhic - bes program and the future fair - cbm program . in the following ,",
    "we briefly discuss the extended ampt model used in the present study .",
    "the initial condition of the ampt model is obtained from the heavy - ion jet interaction generator ( hijing ) model  @xcite , where both soft and hard parton production are included by using the monte carlo glauber model with shadowing effects included for nucleus - nucleus collisions . in the original string melting version , which converts hadrons produced from initial collisions into their valence quarks and antiquarks , the interaction in the partonic phase is described only by parton - parton elastic scatterings based on zhang s parton cascade ( zpc ) model  @xcite without mean - field potentials for partons . in the present study as well as those reported in refs .",
    "@xcite , the zpc model is replaced by a 3-flavor njl transport model that includes both scalar and vector potentials for partons as well as the parton elastic scattering process . to calculate the mean - field potentials , the test - particle method  @xcite with parallel events for the same impact parameter",
    "is used . for the parton scattering cross section",
    ", it can in principle be obtained also from the njl model  @xcite . in this case , the parton scattering cross section would depend on the temperature and quark chemical potential of the partonic matter .",
    "since it is essential for our model to reproduce the experimentally measured charged particle elliptic flow before addressing the effect of mean - field potentials on the elliptical flow splitting between particles and their antiparticles , we take the value of the scattering cross section between partons in the same event as a parameter and determine its value by fitting the experimental charged particle elliptic flow , as will be shown in the next section .",
    "the partonic evolution ends when the chiral phase transition happens , i.e. , the effective mass of light quarks in central cells of the system is half of that in vacuum . a spatial coalescence model as used in the original ampt model is then used to describe the hadronization process with the hadron species determined by the flavor and invariant mass of its constituent quarks or antiquarks .",
    "however , instead of coalescence of quarks in the same event , we extend the coalescence algorithm to allow quarks and antiquarks in an event to coalesce with those in other parallel events .",
    "the hadronization treatment of completely mixing the quarks and antiquarks from all parallel events is equivalent to the use of smooth quark and antiquark phase - space distributions for hadron production via quark coalescence in the pioneering studies in refs .",
    "@xcite , and is particularly useful for rare antiparticles produced at lower collision energies . to keep the fluctuation in the number of hadrons produced from these parallel events , we allow , however , quarks and antiquarks in a given event to coalesce only with certain quarks and antiquarks in the parallel events so that the numbers of mesons and baryons produced in each event are the same as in the original ampt model .",
    "this is possible because in the string melting version of ampt , partons in each event are obtained from converting the baryons and mesons produced from hijing into its constituents , and daughter partons from the same hadron are labeled . in the coalescence algorithm for the hadronization of the partonic matter after its evolution ,",
    "a parton recombines with other partons that are the closest in coordinate space .",
    "if the latter are originally from a different hadron , the sibling partons associated with the hadronized parton are then relabeled as the siblings of the parton whose siblings are involved in this particular coalescence . allowing parton relabelings between parallel events thus does not alter the number of hadrons produced in a given event even the coalescence is done with mixed events .",
    "we note that although the event - by - event particle number fluctuation is maintained in the mixed - event coalescence method , the event - by - event density fluctuation is largely averaged out by using partons from parallel events to evaluate the mean - field potentials .",
    "the only remaining density fluctuation effect comes from the parton scatterings because only partons in the same event can scatter in this extended ampt model .",
    "after hadronization , a relativistic transport ( art ) model is used to describe the evolution of the hadronic phase  @xcite , in which both particle - antiparticle annihilations and their inverse processes are included .",
    "the mean - field potentials for hadrons in the art model are also turned on  @xcite by using the test - particle method with parallel events .",
    "since charges are not strictly conserved in some of the inelastic processes in the original art model , we have corrected this problem by resampling the inelastic channels until the charge is conserved .",
    "based on the above extended ampt model , we have studied heavy - ion collisions at rhic - bes energies . here , we focus on the evolution of the baryon - rich matter produced in these collisions , and discuss the difference in the elliptic flows between particles and their antiparticles .      )",

    "the reason why a larger cross section is needed at higher energies is due to the attractive scalar partonic potential in the njl transport model , whose effect is more pronounced at higher collision energies .",
    "however , the larger parton scattering cross section at higher beam energies likely leads to a decreasing specific shear viscosity @xmath102 of the partonic matter , i.e. , the ratio of the shear viscosity @xmath103 to the entropy density @xmath43 , with increasing temperature , contrary to results from other studies ( see , e.g. , ref .",

    "such a study is , however , beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "figure [ v2pt ] further shows that reducing the strength of the vector potential in the partonic phase by a factor of two only slightly lowers the elliptic flow .",
