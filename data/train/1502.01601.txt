    "systems consisting of multiple inter - connected networks with different types of links have received enormous attention in the recent years @xcite , due to its ubiquitous applications in complex systems .",
    "such networks appear in the literature known as interdependent networks or multiplex networks .",
    "studies have shown that interdependent networks show distinct percolation/ phase transition behaviors from single networks .",
    "in particular , an interdependent network is more vulnerable to random attacks @xcite .",
    "as many real world infrastructure networks can be classified into interdependent networks @xcite , the understanding of their robustness carries great practical significance .    in a network consisting of links and nodes ,",
    "one of the most important quantities used to analyze its robustness is the size of the giant component , which is defined as the largest set of nodes that are connected with each other .",
    "when a network is under attack , i.e. a fraction @xmath0 of nodes ( or links ) are removed , the size of the largest cluster shrinks .",
    "usually its size is a finite fraction of the total number of nodes in the network , unless more than a certain fraction @xmath1 of nodes are removed - then the largest cluster ( as known as the giant component ) disappears and all of the clusters become negligibly small .",
    "this phase is associated with the disintegration of the network .",
    "hence the size @xmath2 of the giant component serves as an order parameter that is very useful in studying the phase transition behaviors and the robustness of the network structure .",
    "one of the original works in @xcite provided a precise and powerful analytical solution to the phase transition behaviors . in their mathematical analysis ,",
    "recursive mapping was used to track the percolation process in each stage of cascading failures . in some systems where correlations exist in dependency links@xcite",
    ", this method could lead to very complicated formulations and not always easy to solve . to study different network constructions , some of the other studies used different methods to achieve a relatively simpler analytical framework .",
    "in particular , the works in @xcite used self - consistent equations of the converging probabilities to have an alternative approach to analyze for the critical behaviors on certain types of interdependent networks . some of these methods can be extended to other scenarios .    in this paper , we illustrate the use of one particular technique based on self - consistent probabilities@xcite , and demonstrate that it could be applied to a wide variety of different interdependent networks with minimum simplicity through surveying the literature in this field .",
    "this method focuses on the recursive representation of two central quantities defined as the probabilities of finding a link / node in the giant component .",
    "it is able to give a set of straight forward self - consistent equations describing the percolation behaviors without going through the cascading process @xcite , and also deal with many correlated systems with simpler mathematics formulations .",
    "first we will illustrate the framework through the example of the single layer network .",
    "next we extend it to multi - layer networks without degree degree correlations . following that we extend the analysis to more complicated scenarios of partially correlated networks and degree - degree correlated networks .",
    "more complications are added to the case when multiple dependency links per node is introduced together with correlations , as well as single network with different types of links , also known as multiplex networks .",
    "the classic site percolation problem in a random network @xcite gives rich phase transition phenomena for various networks structures . in the simplest case",
    ", we consider a random network without any correlations , and its degree distribution @xmath3 fully captures its structural property .",
    "we start by introducing a key quantity @xmath4 in the system ; this @xmath4 will be similarly defined throughout this work and plays a central role in the mathematical analysis .",
    "if we randomly choose a link from the network and travel along one direction of the link , there is a probability @xmath4 it would reach the giant component of the network , and probability @xmath5 it will not .",
    "( see figure  [ fig : definex ] for illustration ) .",
    "suppose we randomly choose a link , and find an arbitrary node @xmath6 by following this link in an arbitrary direction .",
    "the probability that the node @xmath6 has degree @xmath7 is    @xmath8    for this node @xmath6 to be part of the giant component , at least one of its other @xmath9 out - going links ( other than the link we first picked ) leads to the giant component . by calculating this probability",

    "a link ( red color ) is chosen and a node @xmath6 ( in green ) is found .",
    "from the three outgoing links ( dashed lines ) of node a , one of them leads to to the giant component ( represented by the symbol @xmath14 ) .",
    "since at least one of the three outgoing links of @xmath6 leads to the giant component , the red link leads to the giant component . and",
    "we define the probability of finding such a red link as @xmath4 . ]    therefore , for a randomly chosen node @xmath6 , the probability that it is in the giant component is equal to the probability that at least one of its @xmath13 links leads to the giant component .",
    "thus we have : @xmath15 , \\label{en : single_mu}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the probability that none of the @xmath13 links of node @xmath6 leads to the giant component , and @xmath3 is the probability that node @xmath6 has degree @xmath13 .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath2 is also the normalized size of the giant component , i.e. the fraction of nodes in the giant component .",
    "the above equations exactly equal to the results obtained by m. e. j. newman and et.al in @xcite .    in the network percolation problem ,",
    "when a fraction of @xmath0 nodes are randomly removed from the network @xcite , i.e. there is a fraction of @xmath17 node remaining , we could apply the previous equations with slight modifications . assuming that the links of the removed nodes are still present on the network , the probability that a randomly selected link leads to the giant component is the same as before , given by @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "but since only a fraction @xmath17 of the nodes remain in the network , by calculating the probability that the randomly chosen link does not lead to the giant component , the self - consistent equation of @xmath4 in en  ( [ en : single_x ] ) becomes :    @xmath19 , \\label{en : singlep_x}\\ ] ]    where @xmath11 is the probability that at least one of the @xmath9 outgoing links of node @xmath6 leads to the giant component , and @xmath12 is the probability that @xmath6 has degree @xmath13 , same as before .",
    "the additional variable @xmath17 in front is due to the fact that only a fraction of @xmath17 nodes remain in the network after removing @xmath0 nodes .",
    "similarly , the probability that a randomly selected node is in the giant component is :    @xmath20 .",
    "\\label{en : singlep_mu}\\ ] ]    it is known that in a single network , we usually only have second order phase transitions , such that there is no giant component when @xmath17 is smaller than a critical probability @xmath21 . above",
    "the threshold giant component appears and its size increases continuously from 0 with increasing @xmath17 .",
    "this means when @xmath22 , we have @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "when @xmath23 , by taking taylor expansion of en  ( [ en : singlep_x ] ) , we obtain :    @xmath25    which leads to @xmath26    for erdos - renyi network , en  ( [ en : single_pc ] ) yields @xmath27 , in agreement with the known result . for scale free network with @xmath28",
    ", @xmath29 diverges , thus we would obtain @xmath30 , also in agreement with the known result .",
    "the above system is based on node percolation , in which nodes are randomly removed until the giant component disintegrates .",
    "an alternative scenario is link ( bond ) percolation , in which links are randomly removed from the network . in this case",
    ", we still have the same definition for @xmath4 , and its equation remains the same as en  [ en : singlep_x ] , because a randomly selected link has probability @xmath17 to still remain in the network after removing a fraction of @xmath0 links .",

    "\\label{en : singlep_mu'}\\ ] ]    this is due to the fact that all of the nodes remain in the network in link percolation , unlike the cases of node percolation that only a fraction of @xmath17 remains . hence we would obtain the same @xmath31 value for both node and link percolation , but different @xmath2 values .    before we proceed to interdependent networks",
    ", it is worth mentioning that other than second order phase transition mentioned above , there could also be first order phase transition , and the critical threshold can be labelled as @xmath32 . for such phase transitions ,",
    "when @xmath33 the size of the largest cluster is 0 , and abruptly jumps to a non - zero value at @xmath34 .",
    "we shall see more of such examples later .",
    "in the original work of ref  @xcite , generating functions was used to study the phase transitions in the two layer interdependent network .",
    "the system consists of two networks a and b , with degree distributions @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively .",
    "both networks a and b have n nodes , and each node in a is linked with exactly one node in b by a _ dependency link _ , and vice versa .",
    "the dependency link is different from the connectivity links within each network , in the way that once a node on one end of the dependency link is removed , the other node on the other network is also removed .",
    "this corresponds to the case where the failure of a power plant in the grid network will render the connected computer system to shut down due to the unavailability of electricity .",
    "also , any node outside the giant cluster of its own network would fail since it is disconnected with the majority of the other nodes . in the defined mutually connected giant component ( mcgc )",
    ", every node is in the giant component connected via the connectivity links in its own network , and its dependent node is in the giant component of the other network as well .",
    "thus the mcgc is a steady state of the remaining network , such that no further cascading of failures would happen .    here",
    "we present a simple method to study the phase transition behaviors using the formulation extended from the previous section . following the definition in en  ( [ en : single_x ] ) , we define @xmath4 as the probability that a randomly chosen link in network a leads to the giant component . analogously the probability that a randomly chosen link in network b leads to the giant component is @xmath37 .     and",
