    "this step summarizes some consequences of the results from sections 3 and 4 together with :    the first two assertions follow directly from proposition 3.3 .",
    "the third assertion is proved by copying verbatim the proof of lemma 7.5 .",

    "in fact , it follows from ( 7.22 ) that @xmath1405 differs from @xmath1374 by no more than a uniform multiple of @xmath1406 .",
    "the argument for this is as follows : first of all , the integral of @xmath1325 over @xmath1407 is equal to that of @xmath1408 over @xmath1370",
    ". then , the difference between the @xmath1374 and the integeral of @xmath1408 over @xmath1370 is proportional to the integral over @xmath1370 of @xmath1409 . to estimate this last integral , remark first that @xmath1410 can be written as in ( 7.18 ) except that @xmath1411 should replace @xmath337 inside the integral . with the preceding understood ,",
    "let @xmath267 be a standard , non - increasing cut - off function on @xmath1412 which takes value 1 on [ 0 , 1 ] and 0 on @xmath1413 .",
    "then , decompose the @xmath1411 version of ( 7.22 ) into a sum of two integrals ; these being : @xmath1414    now , note that @xmath1415 for some constant @xmath126 which is independent of @xmath1416 and @xmath30 .",
    "this follows using lemma 7.8 and the following :    * @xmath1417 * @xmath1418    the details here are identical to those in section  7 which establish the @xmath956 bound for ( 7.19 ) .    as for @xmath1419 ,",
    "the claim here is that @xmath1420 where @xmath126 is independent of @xmath1416 and @xmath204 .",
    "indeed , this follows readily by differentiating the second line of ( 9.16 ) and again invoking lemma 7.8 . in this case , argue by breaking the integration region into annuli as described in the derivation of the @xmath1421 bound for ( 7.20 ) in section  7 .",
    "given the preceding , it follows from ( 9.18 ) and the estimate @xmath1422 that @xmath1423    this step digresses momentarily to justify a simplifying assumption .",
    "the digression begins with the observation that the subsequent arguments for lemma 9.6 need only consider the case where , for small @xmath653 , the corresponding @xmath1326 ( as defined in ( 9.6 ) ) has no circle component .",
    "indeed , as already remarked in step 3 , if there is a circle component , the integeral of @xmath1325 over this component is a positive , integral multiple of @xmath1424 since @xmath1325 restricts to @xmath1326 as a volume form .",
    "thus , it is sufficient to make the following assumption : let @xmath1318 $ ] and suppose that the corresponding @xmath1326 misses the critical points of @xmath119 on @xmath24 and the singular points of @xmath24",
    ". then @xmath1326 is a finite union of disjoint , embedded arcs with endpoints on @xmath1329 .",
    "choose @xmath1401 and small where @xmath1425 .",
    "a slight ( and arbitrarily small ) change of @xmath545 will insure that @xmath1426 misses all critical points of @xmath119 on @xmath24 , and this condition will henceforth be assumed .",
    "additional constraints on @xmath545 are as follows : first , by choosing @xmath545 small , the points in @xmath24 where @xmath1427 and @xmath1428 will assuredly lie in @xmath1319 on level curve @xmath1429 with each @xmath1430 . furthermore , after possibly a slight change of @xmath545 , each of the corresponding level sets @xmath1431 misses all singular points of @xmath24 , and each @xmath1432 is a regular value of @xmath119 .",
    "this implies that each level set @xmath1433 is a smoothly embedded curve , @xmath1434 , in the smooth part of @xmath24 .",
    "likewise , no generality is lost by assuming that the points in @xmath24 where both @xmath1427 and @xmath1435 lies in @xmath1319 on level curves @xmath1436 with @xmath1437 , and where each such level curve is a smoothly embedded curve , @xmath1438 , in the smooth part of @xmath24 .",
    "there is some direction on each @xmath1434 where @xmath1439 is increasing , and likewise on each @xmath1438 .",
    "thus , @xmath1370 can be completed by attaching the relevant portions of @xmath1434 and @xmath1438 to a give a piecewise smooth arc in @xmath1319 , where each endpoint lies either in @xmath1328 or @xmath1288 , and over which the integral of @xmath1325 is at least @xmath1440 .",
    "note that this arc has at most @xmath984 components , so there is at least one component , say @xmath1441 , with @xmath1442 .",
    "the construction of @xmath1441 does not complete the proof of lemma 9.6 because @xmath1441 does not necessarily lie in a level set of @xmath119 . to achieve the latter requirement ,",
    "it is necessary to modify @xmath1441 .",
    "this modification is carried out via a morse theoretic argument on @xmath24 which uses the function @xmath119 as the morse function and uses the level sets of @xmath118 as the flow lines of a pseudo - gradient vector field . however , before starting , remark that the argument that follows is complicated by three technical issues :    * @xmath24 may have some singular points .",
    "* @xmath119 may have degenerate critical points .",
    "* the pseudo - gradient flow lines may not be in general position .",
    "( 9.20 )    the first issue is dealt with by pulling back the story to the universal model @xmath26 via the pseudo - holomorphic map @xmath1443 as described in definition 1.1 .",
    "the second and third issues in ( 9.20 ) will be dealt with by considering small perturbations of both @xmath1309 and @xmath1444 .    in any event , to begin , choose @xmath1445 but less than the infimum of @xmath119 on @xmath1441 and so that @xmath1446 avoids all critical points of @xmath119 and all singularities of @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath1447 denote the smooth model for @xmath24 from definition 1.1 .",
    "let @xmath1448 .",
    "thus , the boundary of @xmath514 consists of a finite union of arcs , where each arc lies either in a component of @xmath1449 or a component of @xmath1450 or else in a level set of @xmath1309 with level either @xmath891 or @xmath280 .",
    "( the latter coincide with @xmath1451 and @xmath1452 , respectively . )    on the complement of the critical set of @xmath1309 , the tangents to the level sets of @xmath1444 define a vector field which is pseudo - gradient like for the function @xmath1309 .",
    "note that @xmath1453 may not be a union of level sets of @xmath1444 , but proposition 7.1 implies that no generality is lost by requiring @xmath1309 to restrict to @xmath1453 without critical points .",
    "meanwhile , the requirements for the chosen s insure that @xmath1309 also restricts to @xmath1453 without critical points .",
    "thus , one can choose a pseudo - gradient for @xmath1309 which is tangent to the level sets of @xmath1444 except in some arbitrarily small , but apriori fixed neighborhood of @xmath1454 .    the simplest case to consider assumes that @xmath1309 has only non - degenerate critical points and that the tangents to the level sets of @xmath1444 give a suitably generic pseudo - gradient for @xmath1309 .",
    "this genericity assumption will be enforced in the remainder of this step ; the general case is considered in step 14 .    under the preceding genericity assumption , it follows by standard morse theoretic considerations that @xmath514 has a 1skeleton which is constructed as follows : start with the arcs of @xmath1455 and add a finite set of arcs in level sets of @xmath1444 whose endpoints lie on the arcs of @xmath1455 .",
    "this last picture of the one skeleton of @xmath514 implies that there is a continuous , embedded arc , @xmath1456 , in @xmath514 with the following properties :    * @xmath1456 is a union of components , each of which is either an arc in @xmath1457 or else an arc in a level set of @xmath1444 .",
    "* the boundary points of @xmath1456 lie in @xmath1458 and each boundary point of @xmath1441 is connected by an arc in @xmath1459 to a boundary point of @xmath1456 .",
    "( 9.21 )    join the endpoints of @xmath1441 and @xmath1456 in @xmath1460 and call the resulting curve @xmath203 .",
    "orient @xmath203 so that the part which coincides with @xmath1441 is correctly oriented .",
    "then the integral of @xmath1325 over @xmath203 has the form @xmath1461 for some integer @xmath337 .",
    "note that if @xmath1462 , then it follows ( using lemma 9.3 ) that the integral of @xmath1325 over a disjoint union of arcs in @xmath1446 is at least @xmath1463 ( assuming that @xmath280 is small ) and this implies lemma 9.6 .",
    "thus , one can assume that @xmath337 is positive .",
    "now , remark that using standard morse theory , a basis for @xmath1464 can be constructed so that each basis element is a continuously embedded loop in @xmath514 which is a union of embedded arcs .",
    "here , each arc lies in @xmath1465 or in a level set of @xmath1444 .",
    "since the integer @xmath337 is positive , there is at least one such generator on which @xmath1466 integrates to a positive multiple of @xmath1424 .",
    "this also implies lemma 9.6 .",
    "now consider the case where @xmath1309 has some degenerate critical points and/or where the level sets of @xmath1444 are not in general position . in either case",
    ", one can perturb @xmath1309 and the pseudo - gradient vector field in small disks about the critical points of @xmath1309 so that the resulting function , @xmath1467 , has non - degenerate critical points ; and so that the resulting pseudo - gradient flow lines are in general position .    in this regard , note that these perturbations can be assumed to be supported in a union , @xmath1468 , of disks of arbitrarily small ( but positive ) radius about the critical points of @xmath119 .",
    "this means , in particular , that the new function , @xmath1467 , can be assumed to agree with h except in @xmath1469 . and , the new gradient flow lines are level sets of @xmath1444 except in @xmath1469 and except ( possibly ) near @xmath1453 . furthermore , since @xmath1309 is a harmonic function on @xmath26 ( with respect to an appropriate metric ) , the function @xmath1467 can be assumed to have only index 1 critical points also .",
    "thus , the number of such critical points can be taken to be independent of the diameter of the disks which comprise @xmath1469 .",
    "( the point here is that there is some complex coordinate for @xmath26 near each critical point of @xmath1309 for which the latter is the real part of a holomorphic function on a small disk in @xmath860 .",
    "one can then consider standard perturbations of such functions . )    with the preceding understood , standard morse theory arguments can be used to construct the 1skeleton of @xmath514 as follows : start with the arcs of @xmath1465 and add additional arcs with end points on those of @xmath1455 .",
    "the latter arcs lie in level sets of @xmath1444 except where they intersect @xmath1469 .",
    "furthermore , the number of such arcs can be assumed independent of the diameter of @xmath1469 , and the length in @xmath1469 of each such arc can be assumed bounded by a uniform multiple of the diameter of @xmath1469 .",
    "( remember that @xmath1309 is the real part of a holomorphic function with respect to some complex coordinate on a neighborhood of each critical point . )",
    "given this 1skeleton , repeat the arguments of the previous step .",
    "the only difference here comes from the fact that @xmath1466 may have non - zero integral over an arc segment in @xmath1469 .",
    "however , the contribution from the segments in @xmath1469 can be made negligibly small in absolute value because of the following facts :    * each arc segment in @xmath1469 has length bounded by a multiple of the radius of a disk in @xmath1469 . * @xmath1470 at the center of each disk component of @xmath1469 , so @xmath1471 there as well .",
