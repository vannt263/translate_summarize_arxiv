    "wide - field small - aperture telescopes are currently used by a few groups ( e.g. , bakos et al .",

    "2004 , mccullough et al .",
    "2005 , pollacco et al .",
    "2006 ) to search for transiting planetary candidates",
    ". however , light curves obtained using wide - field small - aperture telescopes are usually not accurate enough to put useful constraints on the system parameters .",
    "hence , photometric follow - up using larger telescopes is essential .",
    "the wasp consortium ( pollacco et al .",
    "2006 ) has recently detected two new transiting extrasolar planets , wasp-1b and wasp-2b ( collier cameron et al .",
    "the discovery paper suggested that wasp-1b is probably an inflated , low - density planet , similar to hat - p-1b ( bakos et al .",
    "2006 ) and hd209458b ( e.g. , knutson et al .",
    "however , using the photometry of the superwasp small - aperture cameras and a single transit observed by a 35 cm telescope , collier cameron et al .",
    "( 2006 ) could not constrain the system parameters of wasp-1 very well . in this work we have set out to better constrain these parameters using the wise observatory 1 m telescope .",
    "we describe our observations in   [ obs ] and the data processing in   [ proc ] . in   [ sum ]",
    "we briefly discuss our results .",
    "we observed two wasp-1b transits with the 1 m telescope at the wise observatory , on the nights of 2006 october 4 and 2006 october 9 .",
    "the observations were carried out in the @xmath8 filter , with auto - guiding and no defocusing , using a tektronix @xmath9 pixel back - illuminated ccd , with a pixel scale of 0.696  arcsec  pixel@xmath10 and an @xmath11 arcmin overall field of view ( kaspi et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "on 2006 october 4 the exposure time was @xmath12 seconds at the beginning of the transit , at airmass @xmath13 , decreasing to @xmath14 seconds at lower airmass .",
    "psf fwhm was about @xmath15arcsec that night . on 2006",
    "october 9 exposure time varied between @xmath16 and @xmath14 seconds according to varying observing conditions , in particular the bright moon s altitude .",
    "psf fwhm was about 2.1 arcsec that night .",
    "there was a short period of cloudiness on the october 9 night which prevented us from observing the egress of that transit .",
    "nevertheless , we were able to observe the star for a short period after the transit , thus allowing calibration of the light curve zero point .",
    "we did not center the field of view on the target star but instead positioned it at ra = 00h20m21s , dec = + 32@xmath170239 ",
    "( j2000 ) , in order to include a maximum number of comparison stars , which are essential for the transit light curve reduction .",
    "we used iraf ` ccdproc ` package for the bias subtraction and flat field correction , using calibration exposures taken nightly .",
    "using the iraf ` phot ` task we applied aperture photometry to all field stars in the reduced frames , with a few trial values for the aperture radius and sky annulus size .",
    "for the 2006 october 4 frames we obtained the most satisfactory result with an aperture of @xmath18arcsec and an annulus inner and outer radii of @xmath19 and @xmath20 arcsec , respectively .",
    "for the 2006 october 9 frames , an aperture radius of @xmath21arcsec and an annulus inner and outer radii of @xmath22 and @xmath23arcsec , respectively , yielded the best result .    following winn , holman and roussanova ( 2006 ) ,",
    "we used nine reference stars and normalized their flux light curves to unit median .",
    "we combined these normalized light curves by a simple average and a @xmath24 rejection , thus creating a normalized relative flux comparison light curve .",
    "we normalized the target star flux light curve by dividing it by the comparison light curve .",
    "finally , we fitted a linear function to the out - of - transit measurements and divided the light curve by this function .",
    "we used the eclipsing binary orbit program ( ebop ) code ( popper & etzel 1981 ) together with the sys - rem ( tamuz , mazeh & zucker 2005 ; mazeh , tamuz & zucker 2006 ) code in order to fit the transit light curve to our photometric measurements .",
    "ebop is widely used for modeling eclipsing binary light curves , and can be easily adapted to model transits ( gimenez 2006 ) .",
    "it does not model proximity effects very well , but this is irrelevant for transits .",
    "ebop consists of two modules : a light curve generator and a differential corrections module .",
    "following tamuz , mazeh & north ( 2006 ) we used only the light curve generator and applied our own optimization program .",
    "sys - rem is an algorithm designed to remove systematic effects from photometric light curves without assuming any prior knowledge of the effects .",
    "these effects may result from varying observing conditions between observations , such as airmass and weather conditions .",
    "each systematic effect is a sequence of generalized `` airmasses ''",
    "@xmath25 assigned to each image , where the index @xmath26 refers to the image number and @xmath27 is the number of images .",
    "sys - rem estimates both the effect and a set of coefficients , @xmath28 , which are generalized `` colors '' , assigned to each star @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the number of stars .",
    "essentially , sys - rem optimizes the effects and the coefficients such that subtracting the product @xmath31 from @xmath32 , the @xmath26-th measurement of star @xmath29 , will minimize the rms of the set @xmath33 ( tamuz et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "as a set of photometric measurements can include a few different effects , in our analysis we first estimated @xmath21 systematic effects for each night separately , using the nine reference stars .",
    "then , we searched for a set of @xmath34 generalized color coefficients , six for each of the two nights , together with six transit parameters , giving a total of @xmath35 parameters , that would best fit the target light curve .",
    "the six transit parameters included the mid - transit time @xmath6 , the stellar fractional radius @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the orbital semi - major axis , the ratio of planetary radius to stellar radius @xmath38 , the impact parameter @xmath39 and two magnitude zero points for the two nights @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "transit light curves usually require two additional parameters  the period and a limb - darkening coefficient .",
    "we did not optimize for the period and adopted the period published by collier cameron et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . using the temperature and gravity given by collier cameron et al .",
    "( 2006 ) we adopted a value of @xmath42 ( van hamme 1993 ) .",
    "when @xmath43 is left as a free parameter , the best - fitting value is @xmath44 , which we considered an unphysical result .",
    "given the @xmath45 parameters @xmath6 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , all the other best - fitting @xmath49 parameters can be solved for analytically .",
    "thus we can perform a simple grid search over a @xmath45-dimensional space for the minimum @xmath50 .    after fitting the above model to the data ,",
    "the residual rms was found to be @xmath51 mmag in the first night and @xmath52 mmag in the second .",
    "we therefore set the photometric errors of each measurement to be equal to the corresponding rms , and repeated the analysis .",
    "table  [ lctab ] lists all our sys - rem  detrended measurements .",
    "table  [ params1 ] lists the best - fitting values for each of the two transits independently and for both transits simultaneously .",
    "we estimated the errors of the best - fitting values using monte carlo simulations .",
    "we also give the best - fitting values derived without using sys - rem , i.e. , using only ebop and no detrending .",
    "accuracy of these parameters is up to seven times better than that of collier cameron et al .",
    "we adopted values derived by fitting both nights simultaneously and applying sys - rem . using these parameters we estimate the orbital inclination to be @xmath53 deg .",
    "[ lc ] presents our light curves together with the fitted transit model .",
    "[ contour ] presents two @xmath50 contour maps , from which we can learn about the relations among the best - fitting parameters .",
    "the left panel , presenting @xmath50 as a function of @xmath46 and @xmath48 , shows the well known degeneracy of the impact parameter and the stellar radius , while the right panel , presenting @xmath50 as a function of @xmath46 and @xmath47 , shows that the two radii are practically uncorrelated .",
    ".table of all 583 photometric measurements .",
    "only the first ten measurements are listed here , the complete table is available in the online version of this article in the supplementary materials section . [",

    "we present here photometry of two transits of the planet wasp-1b , recently published by collier cameron et al .",
    "our new data better constrain the system parameters , mainly the stellar and planetary radii .",
    "combined with previously published results , our new data provide a longer time span , which we use in order to fix the phase of the radial - velocity orbit .",
    "our analysis confirms collier cameron et al .",
    "( 2006 ) suggestion that the new planet is an inflated , low - density planet .",
    "we put all our photometric measurements in the public domain for any further study .    in a simultaneous study ,",
    "charbonneau et al . ( 2006 ) conducted follow - up observations of wasp-1 and wasp-2 , and derived estimates for the stellar and planetary radii with the mandel & agol ( 2002 ) formulae .",
    "although being slightly larger , their derived radii for the wasp-1 system , of @xmath54 and @xmath55 , are consistent with ours .",
    "[ rm ] presents the radii and masses of all currently known transiting planets .",
    "the figure shows that wasp-1b radius is similar to hat - p-1b ( bakos et al .",
    "2006 ) and hd209458b ( e.g. , knutson et al .",
    "2006 ) radii .",
    "this small but growing group of inflated extrasolar planets , whose radii is larger than predicted by common theories of planet formation and evolution ( e.g. , laughlin et al .",
    "2005 ) , consists a significant fraction of all currently known transiting planets .",
    "a number of possible explanations were suggested to account for this discrepancy between theory and observations by considering , for example , an internal heat source as the cause of these large radii ( e.g. , bodenheimer , laughlin & lin 2003 , winn & holman 2005 ) .",
    "however , in a recent paper , burrows et al .",
    "( 2006 ) suggest that enhanced planetary atmospheric metallicities , which increase atmospheric opacities , is the underlying mechanism responsible for inflating these extrasolar planets .",
    "this explanation does not require any additional heat source and is consistent with the increased probability of high metallicity stars to host planets ( santos et al .",
    "2005 , fischer & valenti 2005 ) .",
    "in addition , burrows et al .",
    "( 2006 ) also pointed out that the commonly used analysis of transiting light curves tend to derive radius larger than the one used in theory , which consider a planet radius till the point where the optical depth in the planet s atmosphere is @xmath56 .    combined with all the currently available mass and radius of transiting extrasolar planets , our new values , plotted in fig .",
    "[ massper ] , are consistent with the mass - period relation pointed out by mazeh , zucker & pont ( 2005 ) and by gaudi , seager & mallen - ornelas ( 2005 ) .",
    "the only outlier to this relation is hd149026b ( sato et al .",
    "2005 ) which probably has a dense core ( fortney et al .",
    "we can gain a deeper understanding of this relation and its possible origin by considering the energy diagram of lecavelier des etangs ( 2006 , his fig .",
    "1 ) presenting the surface potential energy of _ all _ extrasolar planets versus the euv energy flux they receive from their host star .",
    "that diagram clearly shows a forbidden region , in which planets with masses too small evaporate because they absorb energy fluxes too large . maybe the planets can not populate the left - hand bottom of our diagram because of evaporation",
    "however , this scenario does not account for the paucity of transiting planets in the upper right of the diagram .",
    "therefore , we have to find many more transiting planets , in order to verify the mass - period relation and understand its nature .",
    "we would like to thank efi hoory for his dedicated work while observing wasp-1 on the night of 2006 october 9 .",
    "we also wish to thank elia leibowitz and liliana formiggini for allowing us to use their telescope time on the night of 2006 october 4 . we thank the anonymous referee for his thorough reading of the paper and his comments which allowed us to improve this paper .",
    "this work was supported by the israeli science foundation through grant no . 03/323 .",
