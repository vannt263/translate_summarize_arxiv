    "the discovery of neutrino masses by the combination of a variety of data from solar  @xcite , atmospheric  @xcite , reactor  @xcite and accelerator  @xcite neutrino experiments was the major recent achievement in astroparticle , high energy , and nuclear physics , which culminates a heroic effort dating back to about four decades .",

    "in 1998 the super - k experiment obtained evidence for neutrino oscillations  @xcite from the observation of the zenith angle dependence of their @xmath7-like atmospheric neutrino data .",
    "this effect has been confirmed also by other atmospheric neutrino experiments , see _",
    "e.g. _  refs .",
    "recently , super - k has reported a dip in the @xmath8 distribution of the atmospheric @xmath9 survival probability  @xcite , which provides a clear signature for neutrino oscillations .    in our atmospheric neutrino analysis",
    "we include the most recent charged - current atmospheric neutrino data from super - k  @xcite , including the @xmath10-like and @xmath7-like data samples of sub- and multi - gev contained events ( each grouped into 10 bins in zenith angle ) , as well as the stopping ( 5 angular bins ) and through - going ( 10 angular bins ) up - going muon data events .",
    "as previously , we do not use the information on @xmath11 appearance , multi - ring @xmath7 and neutral - current events since an efficient monte - carlo simulation of these data would require a more detailed knowledge of the super - k experiment , and in particular of the way the neutral - current signal is extracted from the data . for details of our analysis see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein . with respect to our previous atmospheric neutrino analysis",
    "@xcite we have now taken into account the new three  dimensional atmospheric neutrino fluxes given in ref .  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have updated our statistical analysis following closely ref .",

    "the kek to kamioka ( k2k ) long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiment  @xcite probes the @xmath9 disappearance oscillation channel in the same region of @xmath18 as explored by atmospheric neutrinos . the neutrino beam is produced by a 12  gev proton beam from the kek proton synchrotron , and consists of 98% muon neutrinos with a mean energy of 1.3  gev .",
    "the beam is controlled by a near detector 300  m away from the proton target .",
    "information on neutrino oscillations is obtained by the comparison of this near detector data with the @xmath9 content of the beam observed by the super - kamiokande detector at a distance of 250  km .",
    "the data sample called k2k - i  @xcite has been collected in the period from june 1999 to july 2001 ( @xmath19 protons on target ) .",
    "k2k - i has observed 56 events in super - k , whereas @xmath20 have been expected in the case of no oscillations .",
    "this gives a clear evidence for @xmath9 disappearance : the probability that the observed flux at super - k is explained by a statistical fluctuation without neutrino oscillations is less than 1%  @xcite .",
    "recently , at the neutrino2004 conference new data from the k2k - ii period have been presented  @xcite .",
    "k2k - ii started in fall 2002 , and the released data corresponds to @xmath21 protons on target , comparable to the k2k - i sample . from the combined analysis of k2k - i and k2k - ii 108 events have been observed in super - k , whereas @xmath22 have been expected for no oscillations .",
    "out of the 108 events 56 are so - called single - ring muon events .",
    "this data sample contains mainly muon events from the quasi - elastic scattering @xmath23 , and the reconstructed energy is closely related to the true neutrino energy .",
    "hence these data can be used for a spectral analysis . using the kolmogorov - smirnov test",
    "the k2k collaboration finds that the observed spectrum is consistent with the spectrum expected for no oscillation only at a probability of 0.11% , whereas the spectrum predicted by the best fit oscillation parameters has a probability of 52%  @xcite .    in our re - analysis of k2k data we use the energy spectrum of the 56 single - ring muon events from k2k - i + k2k - ii  .",
    "similar as in ref .",
    "@xcite we use a phenomenological parameterization for the spectrum expected for no oscillation . adopting reasonable assumptions on the energy resolution function and on systematical errors , we fit the data divided into 15 bins in reconstructed neutrino energy , as given in ref .",

    "@xcite neutrino decays have been considered since long ago  @xcite .",
    "non - standard interactions arising from the 1 charged and neutral currents  @xcite or from new particles  @xcite , as well as quantum mechanical decoherence  @xcite might also affect atmospheric neutrino results .",
    "although strongly rejected by recent atmospheric data as the dominant mechanisms  @xcite , non - standard phenomena might still be present at a sub - leading level in addition to oscillations and , to this extent , have some impact on the determination of the oscillation parameters .",
    "in the following we illustrate the stability of the measurement of @xmath2 and @xmath13 by assuming the presence of non - standard interactions of the neutrinos with earth matter .",
    "new neutrino interactions beyond the standard model are a natural feature in most neutrino mass models  @xcite and can be of two types : flavour - changing ( fc ) and non - universal ( nu ) .",

    "such interactions may arise from a nontrivial structure of charged and neutral current weak interactions characterized by a non - unitary lepton mixing matrix  @xcite .",
    "these gauge - induced nsi may lead to flavour and cp violation , even with massless or degenerate neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , such non - standard neutrino interactions may also arise in models where neutrino masses are `` calculable '' from radiative corrections  @xcite and in some supersymmetric models with broken r parity  @xcite .",
    "finally , in supersymmetric unified models , the strength of non - standard neutrino interactions may be a calculable renormalization effect  @xcite .",
    "the impact of non - standard neutrino interactions on atmospheric neutrinos was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite treating the nsi strengths as free phenomenological parameters .",
    "this analysis takes into account both the effect of @xmath29 oscillations ( osc ) as well as the existence of non - standard neutrino  matter interactions ( nsi ) in this channel .",
    "in addition to the standard term in the hamiltonian describing oscillations an term @xmath30 is introduced , accounting for an effective potential induced by the nsi with earth matter : @xmath31 here @xmath32 holds for neutrinos ( anti - neutrinos ) and @xmath28 and @xmath33 parameterize the nsi : @xmath34 is the forward scattering amplitude for the fc process @xmath35 and @xmath36 represents the difference between @xmath37 and @xmath38 elastic forward scattering .",

    "@xcite . ] . in the left panels the pure oscillation case ( @xmath45 )",
    "is compared to the case where also some nsi are allowed .",
    "we find that the @xmath12 improves slightly ( 2.4 units ) in the presence of nsi , but the determination of the oscillation parameters is practically unaffected .",
    "this is an important result , since it shows that the allowed ranges derived for @xmath2 and @xmath41 are rather stable with respect to non - standard physics   also the up - going muon data from the macro experiment  @xcite is used .",

    "they could lead to `` deep - inside '' neutrino conversions , in addition to those expected from conventional neutrino oscillations .",
    "in this section we consider oscillations of solar neutrinos in the two - flavour framework .",

    "we include the most recent data from the salt phase  @xcite in the form of the neutral current ( nc ) , charged current ( cc ) and elastic scattering ( es ) fluxes , as well as the 2002 spectral day / night data  @xcite ( 17 energy bins for each day and night period ) .",
    "the analysis methods used here are similar to the ones described in refs .",

    "for example , for each of the eight solar neutrino fluxes a parameter is introduced , and the predictions from the standard solar model including the correlated errors are taken into account by means of a penalty function . the method described in ref .",
