    "this lecture is devoted to a general semiquantitative description of the early stages of a heavy ion collision .",
    "this is a rapidly evolving subject and it is not yet clear how good a description can be given in terms of qcd .",
    "in the earliest stages of the collision gluon occupation numbers are estimated to be moderately large suggesting a classical gauge theory description .",
    "this fits in nicely with the saturation picture ( color glass condensate ) of a high - energy heavy ion wavefunction .",
    "the parameters necessary for such a description seem compatible with an analogous description of small - x and moderate @xmath0 hera data .    various discussions of rhic data in terms of gluon saturation , which dicussions have much in common , are reviewed .",
    "the general picture appears to be coherent although perhaps not yet compelling .",
    "the reader should be warned that many of the numbers quoted in the text are theoretical estimates .",
    "there are large uncertainties present , neverthelelss , i believe the estimates to be reasonable .",
    "consider a central collision at rhic , say at @xmath1 the measured transverse energy is @xmath2@xcite at central rapidities .",
    "since some of the initial transverse energy goes into longitudinal flow one certainly has    @xmath3    for the initial transverse energy distribution , which we assume is predominately in gluons .",
    "thus one can write    @xmath4 a_g\\cdot k \\gtrsim 500 gev\\ ] ]    with @xmath5 and @xmath6 the coordinates of a point in the overlaping nuclei and where @xmath7 is the longitudinal width of the volume occupied by gluons at their time of production , @xmath8 is the area , transverse to the colliding beams , occupied by the gluons and @xmath9 is a typical gluon transverse momentum .",
    "taking @xmath10   and   @xmath11 gives    @xmath12    and with @xmath13 ( see later )    @xmath14    where ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , as well as @xmath15 represent average values , averaged over all transverse coordinates . at the center of the nucleus , @xmath16 the more appropriate value of @xmath9 is about @xmath17 the average value or @xmath18 with @xmath19 the gluon saturation momentum , so that    @xmath20    equations ( 2 - 4 ) give a reasonable guess as to the initial gluon densities averaged over the production region ( equations ( 2,3 ) ) and at the center of the production region ( equation ( 4 ) ) .",
    "the initial gluon number densities discussed just above can be converted to gluon occupation numbers ( phase space densities ) by    @xmath21    where we use @xmath22 and where the 2 in the denominator refers to the number of spin states available to gluons .",
    "we further make the approximation    @xmath23    using ( 4 ) and ( 6 ) in ( 5 ) gives    @xmath24    at @xmath25 thus , it would seem that gluon occupation numbers are moderately large at initial times thus fitting well the picture of strong gluon field dominance at early times in heavy ion collisions .",
    "it is convenient to view a head - on ( central ) ion - ion collision in a frame where one of the ions is at rest and the other carries a large longitudinal momentum .",
    "we view the scattering in a light - cone gauge which furnishes the smoothiest connection between gluon quanta present in the wavefunction and the gluons produced at the time of the collision .",
    "roughly , produced gluons at mid - rapidity are already in the wavefunction of the fast ion and are merely `` freed '' by the collision@xcite .",
    "the picture is illustrated in fig.1 .",
    "the initial wavefunction has a large occupation number for gluons , @xmath26 which results in a high density of produced gluons at the time of production .",
    "the fact that @xmath27 is large in the high - energy ion s wavefunction is one of the features that led mclerran and collaborators to call it a color glass condensate .",
    "the mclerran - venugopalan@xcite model is a simple but maybe not unrealistic model of the small - x gluonic part of the wavefunction of a heavy ion at rhic energies .",
    "the feynman graphs contributing to the wavefunction@xcite are illustrated in fig.2 .",
    "the gluons in the wavefunction correpond to a quasiclassical picture because only tree graphs are involved even when one squares the wavefunction to get the gluon number density .",
    "the gluon number density takes a very simple form@xcite    @xmath28    where the saturation momentun , @xmath29 is given by    @xmath30    as a function of the impact parameter in the nucleus and of the bjorken variable , @xmath31 calling    @xmath32    one can write the saturation momentum as    @xmath33    it is straightforward to get the gluon occupation number in the wavefunction from ( 8) , using a formula analogous to ( 5 ) , and one finds    @xmath34    where the approximate evaluation , given by the t - integral , is valid when @xmath35 is not too large .",
    "this form of the integral neglects a weak @xmath36 singularity which is present in @xmath37 via the scale of @xmath38 in ( 9 ) .    from ( 12 ) it is apparent that @xmath39 when @xmath40 is not large .",
    "occupation numbers of size @xmath41 are characteristic of classical field theory solutions , here using the valence quarks of the nucleons of the nucleus as the sources of color charge .",
    "the mclerran - venugopalan model gives the gluons in the wavefunction of the nucleus as the weizscker - williams field generated by the valence quarks of the nucleus . at rhic energies",
    "this may be a not bad approximation . at lhc energies quantun evolution in the longitudinal momentum ( bfkl evolution ) will also be important thus further increasing the gluon numbers by raising the saturation momentum , @xmath19@xcite . for gluons having @xmath42 on the order of one , which gluons will dominate the initially produced energy in an ion - ion collision , the occupation number @xmath43 the fact that @xmath27 never grows larger than a fixed constant times @xmath44^{-1}$ ] when @xmath45 is the essence of the idea of gluon saturation@xcite and corresponds to the dominance of the initially produced energy density by fields @xmath46",
    "many of the properties of the small - x wavefunction of a high - energy heavy ion are also present in high - energy protons and have been extensively studied at hera .",
    "there is some evidence for saturation at hera , although most of the evidence is indirect and makes use of models of the golec - biernat wsthoff type@xcite .    in the golec - biernat wsthoff model one",
    "views virtual photon - proton scattering in terms a quark - antiquark dipole , coming from the @xmath47 scattering on the proton .",
    "qcd evolution is put into the proton so that the scattering is that of a bare dipole , having no evolution , colliding with a highly evolved proton wavefunction .",
    "the situation is illustrated in fig.3 while the formulas are@xcite    @xmath48    and    @xmath49    for @xmath50 and the diffractive part of @xmath51 respectively .",
    "the various factors in ( 13 ) have ready interpretations .",
    "the @xmath52 is the factor connecting @xmath50 to the scattering cross section of an ( off - shell ) transversely polarized virtual photon on a proton .",
    "@xmath53 is the lowest order wavefunction for a photon of virtuality @xmath54 to go into a quark - antiquark pair having transverse coordinate separation @xmath55 and with longitudinal momentum fractions @xmath56 and @xmath57 for the two members of the dipole .",
    "@xmath58 represents the impact parameter averaged s - matrix for the elastic scattering of a dipole on a proton while @xmath59 represents the size ( area ) of the proton .",
    "there are three parameters in the model    @xmath60    where    @xmath61    in units of @xmath62 with @xmath63 having the interpretation of an impact parameter averaged quark saturation momentum of the proton where the gluon and quark saturation momenta are related by    @xmath64    the interpretation of ( 14 ) goes much the same way .",
    "there is also a term involving the scattering of a quark - antiquark - gluon system on the proton , but this introduces no new parameters .    with the three parameters of the model given as in ( 15 ) the g - b w model does a good job in fitting the moderate @xmath0 and low @xmath65 hera data .",
    "saturation plays an important role because the dipole - proton s - matrix    @xmath66    becomes zero when @xmath67 thus limiting the contribution of large dipole configurations in ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) to that allowed by unitarity .",
    "this limitation is especially important in diffractive scattering which in perturbation theory has a strong divergence coming from large dipole sizes .    in the hera",
    "range the value of @xmath68 from ( 16 ) is between 1 and 2 @xmath69 giving @xmath70 as we shall see later this value may be a little large and a more realistic model can be expected to give somewhat lower values of @xmath71      one can get information on the s - matrix for dipole - proton scattering as a function of impact parameter by using @xmath72 proton @xmath73 proton and @xmath72 proton @xmath74 proton quasielastic scattering data@xcite .",
    "the process is pictured in fig.4 for the production of longitudinally polarized @xmath75-mesons at momentum transfer @xmath76 to analyze the process one also needs a model of the @xmath75-meson wavefunction which is taken from earlier phenomenological analyses@xcite . in the approximation that the dipole - proton scattering amplitude is purely imaginary one can write the amplitude in terms of the square root of the differential cross section .",
    "it is straightforward to arrive at    @xmath77    where    @xmath78    is the overlap of the wavefunctions for a longitudinal virtual photon with a longitudinal @xmath79meson . @xmath80",
    "depends on the impact parameter , @xmath81 on the bjorken @xmath82variable , and on the transverse size of the dipole pair , @xmath83 which is fixed , approximately , in terms of @xmath84    in order to interpret ( 19 ) in terms quantities we have used in the golec - biernat wsthoff model write @xmath80 as in ( 18)@xcite .",
    "( this form for @xmath80 is not generally true , but it is not unreasonable when gluon number densities are large . ) from fitting the data at @xmath85 and @xmath86 one gets    @xmath87    although the values given in ( 21 ) have considerable uncertainity , mainly from deciding what value of @xmath55 to assoicate with a given @xmath88 i think they are reasonable .",
    "they are somewhat smaller than those that come from the golec - biernat wsthoff model . using ( 11 ) to write    @xmath89",
    "we are led to    @xmath90    for the values of @xmath65 and @xmath0 quoted above .",
    "now let s be really adventurous and scale ( 23 ) back to rhic energies , @xmath91 by using the scaling law    @xmath92    found in the golec - biernat wsthoff analysis .",
    "this gives    @xmath93    a little larger than most perturbative qcd fits , but not a crazy number at all .",
    "now that we have @xmath94 for the proton at rhic energies we can use ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) to get the corresponding gluon density and saturation momentum . for au at rhic energies one finds from ( 9 ) , ( 10 ) and ( 25 )    @xmath95    not too different from our estimate given in sec.2.1 for the values of the typical momentum and number density of gluons produced in a heavy ion collision .",
    "we shall come back a little later to the question of the relationship between the number density of gluons in the wavefunction of an ion just before collision and the number density of initially produced gluons .",
    "for the wavefunction of a heavy ion , and at rhic energies , the mclerran - venugopalan model should be adequate .",
    "however , by lhc energies , gluon evolution will certainly become important@xcite and may even be significant at rhic energies .",
    "the density of gluons in the wavefunction ( 26 ) and initially produced ( 2 - 4 ) is so large at rhic that the idea of viewing the wavefunction and the production process in terms of hadrons and in terms of nucleon - nucleon collisions , respectively , does not make sense .",
    "the collision must be viewed in terms of quarks and gluons .",
    "the mclerran - venugopalan model uses classical gluon dynamics with random color sources given by the valence quarks . because gluon occupation numbers are reasonably large the freeing ( production ) of gluons in an ion - ion collision should also be amenable to a description in terms of classical gluon dynamics . so far there have been two important approaches to this problem .",
    "krasnitz and venugopalan@xcite have developed a numerical procedure for calculating the early stages of a heavy ion collision in terms of discretized classical yang - mills equations .",
    "the results of these calculations will be discussed shortly .",
    "kovchegov@xcite has tried to calculate the gluon production cross section by looking at feynman graphs .",
    "his procedure for gluon production in proton - nucleus and nucleus - proton collisions gives reliable results .",
    "( nucleus - proton scattering is not the same as proton - nucleus scattering in kovchegov s calculation because of the use of a particular light - cone gauge . )",
    "it is still an open question whether his procedure is valid for nucleus - nucleus collisions , although the results which come out are quite reasonable .      starting with a mclerran - venugopalan wavefunction as an initial condition krasnitz , nara and venugopalan",
    "numerically solve discretize yang - mills equations as the nuclei in a heavy ion collision overlap .",
    "gluons appear to be freed on a time scale @xmath96 just before the collision the distribution of gluons in one of the nuclear wavefunctions is given by ( 8) and with gluon occupation numbers given by ( 12 ) .",
    "just after the gluons are freed the distribution of liberated gluons fits well to the empirical formula    @xmath97    with @xmath98 and @xmath99 giving    @xmath100    so long as @xmath101 is not too small .    comparing ( 8) to ( 27 )",
    "one sees that @xmath102 , the fraction of gluons freed in the collision , obeys @xmath103 in the wavefunction @xmath104 while in the initial distribution ( 28 ) , @xmath105 so that the freeing process seems to create a lot of additional transverse energy which is not present in the ion wavefunction .",
    "one worrisome result of the calculation is that the occupation number , given by ( 28 ) , is quite small so that classical evolution can not be expected to be reliable after the gluons have been freed and one might even worry about the validity of the freeing calculation being done at a classical level .",
    "when @xmath106 kinetic theory does not apply and classical field theory is the right approach .",
    "thus in the earliest stages of a heavy ion collision , during the time of the freeing of the gluons and immediately after , classical field theory is the natural dynamics to use .",
    "there may be a practical problem , however , because the krasnitz - nara - venugopalan calculation@xcite suggests that there is a rapid lowering of the occupation number as the gluons are being liberated .",
    "thus , although there is a @xmath41 factor in ( 28 ) the actual value of @xmath27 is not large in any practical circumstance . if it should turn out that the classical calculation is not valid numerically during the freeing of gluons the correct dynamics",
    "would then be a full quantum field theoretic calculation starting from just before the collision up to the time gluons have been freed , a very difficult calculation .",
    "after gluons have been freed and in the regime ( perhaps purely a formal regime ) where @xmath107 classical field theory and the boltzmann equation are equivalent procedures for calculating the time evolution of the system@xcite .",
    "when @xmath108 classical field theory , which only keeps the @xmath27 in statistical factors @xmath109 is an underestimate of the interation strength of gluons while the boltzmann equation is systematic .",
    "the `` bottom - up '' picture of evolution@xcite uses the boltzmann equation , including elastic and inelastic collision terms , and follows the gluon system from shortly after gluons have been produced up to the time when equilibration occurs .",
    "the `` bottom - up '' picture of thermalization applies to a collision of heavy ions where the freed transverse energy is dominated by gluons having transverse momenta well into the perturbative scale . at rhic energies the transverse momenta which dominate are in the region of one gev and",
    "so one might expect the picture to be qualitatively and even semiquantitatively correct but precise calculations are always going to be hard to come by .",
    "the picture does not require that the initial state of the system have large occupation numbers but we shall describe it in the context of the initial conditions being given by gluon saturated heavy ion - wavefunctions .    consider a head - on high energy heavy ion collision .",
    "our description will refer to gluons in the central unit of rapidity in the center of mass system .",
    "the time over which the gluons are freed is @xmath110 this is also the time scale on which the higher rapidity gluons separate , in the longitudinal spatial direction , from the gluons in the central unit of rapidity with which we are concerned .",
    "we presume that a finite fraction , c , of the gluons in the initial wavefunction have been freed in the collision as discussed in sec.2.3 giving initial gluon occupation numbers on the order of @xmath111    as @xmath112 grows the occupation number decreases due to elastic scattering during the longitudinal expansion of the system .",
    "when @xmath27 is significantly less than @xmath41 the boltzmann equation , the basic dynamics in the bottom - up picture , begins to be applicable . when @xmath112 gets as large as @xmath113 the occupation number for gluons becomes less than one .    when @xmath114 the dominant process is soft gluon emission from the hard gluons .",
    "during this period the density of soft gluons ( having @xmath115 is catching up with the density of hard gluons ( having @xmath116 ) , although both densities are decreasing in time due to longitudinal expansion .    when @xmath117 the density of soft gluons reaches that of hard gluons .",
    "at later times two important changes happen .",
    "( i ) the soft gluons stimulate further emission of soft gluons so that now the number density of soft gluons grow with time in spite of the longitudinal expansion .",
    "( ii)the soft gluons equilibrate amongst themselves with the hard gluons serving as a source of energy causing the temperature of the soft gluons to grow with time as @xmath118 the rate of flow of energy from hard gluons continues to grow until , at @xmath119 the hard gluons disappear , having lost all their energy , and one is left with a completely equilibrated system . at later times",
    "the temperature decreases @xmath120 as the equilibrated system continues to expand .",
    "the various stages in the equilibration process are shwon in fig.5 .",
    "finally , it is important to note that it is probably overly optimistic to believe that these separate regimes are sharply distinct at rhic energies .",
    "now let us try to simply characterize charged hadron production at rhic .",
    "take a central collision . then at mid - rapidity the initial gluon density in the mclerran - venugopalan model is@xcite    @xmath121    where @xmath102 is the fraction of gluons liberated .",
    "eq.(29 ) is easily obtained by integrating ( 8) over @xmath122 using ( 9 ) , and inserting the gluon freeing factor @xmath123 now at late times the experiments measure the rapidity distribution of charged hadrons . from ( 29 ) we get    @xmath124    where @xmath125 is the number of participants , the factor @xmath126 accounts for the fraction of charged particles and r is an inelasticity factor as the partonic system evolves to equilibrium .",
    "( r also accounts for any , presumably small , change in particle numbers as quarks and gluons go to hadrons . )",
    "the experimental value@xcite of 3.8 corresponds to @xmath127    kharzeev , levin and nardi take a very simple picture where @xmath128 so that @xmath129 the kln analysis was the first detailed analysis of particle production at rhic using the saturation ( color glass condensate ) picture and so it has great historical importance .",
    "i believe it is probably difficult to get @xmath130 as large as 5.7 .",
    "the krasnitz , nara , venugopalan picture@xcite is also a saturation picture where , however , one of the primary achievements was to calculate @xmath102 and find that @xmath131 at rhic energies .",
    "moderately large values of @xmath132 and @xmath94 are necessary to agree with the data",
    ".    the `` bottom - up '' picture does not give a precise value for @xmath133 and of course there is no calculation of @xmath102 or of @xmath134 however , given values of @xmath135 and @xmath94 one does get values ( estimates ) for the time at which equilibration occurs and the temperature at that time .",
    "for @xmath136 and @xmath137 one gets @xmath138 and @xmath139 values which seem reasonable .",
    "the kln , knv and `` bottom - up '' pictures are all based on the same ideas , and differ only in the focus of the calculation and in the various details .",
    "consider gluon emission in quark - nucleus scattering where the coherence time of the gluon is larger than the nuclear radius .",
    "the process is best viewed in the rest system of the nucleus and is shown in fig.6 in lowest order .",
    "the graph in part ( a ) of the figure corresponds to a gluon in the wavefunction of the quark as the quark reaches the nucleus .",
    "graph ( b ) corresponds to gluon emission after the quark passes the nucleus .",
    "the calculation is straightforward to perform@xcite .",
    "the square of graph ( a ) liberates all gluons having @xmath140 while the square of graph ( b ) gives the `` shadow '' of graph ( a ) producing gluons with a @xmath141 spectrum for @xmath142 the interference terms do not contribute when @xmath143 and they cancel the direct terms for @xmath142 the calculation can be generalize to an incident proton on a nucleus with a similar result . thus one gets      corresponding to a gluon liberation factor of 2 .",
    "the fact that the gluon liberation factor is 2 rather than 1 corresponds to the `` shadow '' term and has a quantum mechanical interpretation analogous to the result of @xmath145 for the scattering of a particle off a hard sphere in non - relativisstic quantum mechanics .",
    "now , what is surprising is that the krasnitz , nara , venugopalan calculation gives a much smaller number , @xmath146 the lack of a `` shadow '' term in heavy ion collisions is perhaps natural .",
    "then we are left with trying to understand why @xmath102 is near to @xmath147 rather than 1 . in the case of proton - a scattering",
    "most of the freed gluons coming from the ( a ) term in fig.6 have a momentum , @xmath122 in the proton s wavefunction obeying @xmath148 parametrically for large @xmath149 for a - a collisions the freed gluons in the wavefunction have @xmath42 on the order of one so perhaps it is not  surprising that some of the gluons having @xmath150 on the order of @xmath19 are not freed .",
    "this indeed , might be expected if it were not for the fact that the freeing process , as described in sec.4.1 creates so much transverse momentum .",
    "one of the strongest indications of an early equilibration of the quark gluon plasma in ion - ion collisions at rhic is elliiptic flow@xcite .",
    "detailed calculations using the equations of ideal hydrodynamics suggest that thermalization must occur by @xmath152 in order to get a sufficiently large elliptic flow@xcite . on the other hand it appears extremely difficult to get such early equilibration from perturbative qcd ; the interaction strength does not seem strong enough to cause equibibration at such early times@xcite .",
    "one can see the difficulty very simply . to match rhic data",
    "the thermalized quark - gluon plasma at @xmath153 has a temperature about @xmath154 corresponding to a typical quark and gluon momentum of about @xmath155 perturbative calculations should be reliable to test whether gluons having @xmath156 can be in equilibrium .",
    "the mean free path for a @xmath156 gluon to have a collision with momentum transfer @xmath156 is on the order of 10fm at @xmath157 thus it is extremely difficult to see how 2 gev gluons can be thermalized at @xmath158 on the other hand gluons of @xmath159 are still in the process of being produced at @xmath160 indeed , krasnitz and venugopalan@xcite find that the dominant energy density only becomes produced when @xmath96 thus , while it is not impossible that an effective thermalization of gluons in the regime @xmath161 could occur at @xmath152 it would be puzzling from the qcd dynamics point of view .",
    "experiments on @xmath163pair production in proton - a reactions observed a broadening in the transverse momentum , @xmath164 spectrum of the @xmath163pair@xcite .",
    "on the theoretical side one expects the change in the width of the @xmath165spectrum to be@xcite      where l is the length of nuclear material the annihilating antiquark passes through , @xmath75 is the nuclear density , and @xmath38 is the nucleon gluon distribution . with @xmath167 ( 32 )",
    "is in reasonable agreement with data . now recalling ( 9 ) and ( 17 )",
    "we see that ( 9 ) and ( 32 ) are really the same formula@xcite .",
    "thus we can get another formula for @xmath37 as              this number is about a factor of 2 smaller than what one might expect at rhic , but at rhic energies @xmath171 may well be significantly larger than at fixed target energies",
    ". a comparison of the @xmath163pair spectrum of proton - proton and proton - nucleus reactions could give a good direct measurement of @xmath63 while a comparison of the @xmath172 production transverse momentum spectrum could give a good direct measurement of @xmath71    9 phenix collaboration , k. adcox et al .",
