    "the string and m - theories describing gravity as higher - dimensional interaction appearing to be effectively 4d at low energies inspired braneworld models with the observable universe being a 3-brane ( domain wall ) to which the standard non - gravitational matter fields are confined ; on the other hand , gravity enters the extra spatial dimensions allowed to be much larger than @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "gravity can be localized near the brane even with an infinite size extra dimension with the warped spacetime satisfying the 5d einstein equations with a negative cosmological constant , as shown by randall and sundrum @xcite .",
    "consequently , an arbitrary energy - momentum tensor could be allowed on the brane with effective 4d einstein equations @xcite .",
    "the randall  sundrum model gives standard 4d einstein equations in the low - energy limit , but significant deviations occur at very high energies , e.g. , in the vicinity of compact objects , such as black holes @xcite or neutron stars @xcite .",
    "there are high - energy effects of local origin influencing pressure of matter and non - local effects of `` back - reaction '' origin arising from the influence of the weyl curvature of the bulk space on the brane .",
    "the combination of the high - energy ( local ) and bulk stress ( non - local ) effects alters significantly the matching problems on the brane in comparison with the standard 4d gravity @xcite , and the stresses induced by the bulk gravity imply that the matching conditions do not have unique solution on the brane @xcite .",
    "the 5d weyl tensor is needed as a minimum condition for uniqueness , but no exact 5d solution is known recently @xcite .    assuming a spherically symmetric metric induced on the brane",

    "the tidal charge @xmath1 stands instead of the charge parameter @xmath2 of the standard rn spacetimes  @xcite ; @xmath1 can be both positive and negative , but there are indications that @xmath3 should properly represent the effects of the bulk space weyl tensor @xcite .    in the case of spherically symmetric neutron stars ( or quark stars ) simplified by the uniform energy density profile , the local high - energy and non - local bulk graviton stress effects make the matching conditions unambitious , since we do not know the 5d weyl tensor .",
    "note that the uniform energy density distribution model of neutron stars could , in principle , be used in order to roughly determine the neutron star spacetime structure , since in realistic models with a variety of realistic equations of state , the energy density profile happens to be nearly uniform in most of the neutron star interior @xcite .",
    "two different exact exterior solutions related to the uniform density interior are known , both having asymptotically schwarzschild character @xcite .",

    "the second one is more complicated , with metric components being explicitly dependent on the energy density and brane tension @xcite .",
    "quite recently , the solution of the rn type was used in the weak - field limit in order to obtain restrictions on the brany parameter and the brane tension from the standard tests on the mercury perihelion precession , deflection of light near the edge of sun and the radar echo experiments @xcite . here",
    ", we also restrict our investigations to the metric of the rn type in order to obtain an idea of the tidal charge relevance in a strong gravitational field near neutron stars ( or black holes ) and to find restrictions on the allowed values of the brany parameter .",
    "the choice of the rn type of the uniform star brany solutions is supported by a recent study of static exteriors of non - static brany stars showing that spherical non - rotating star solutions admit only schwarzschild or rn type exterior @xcite . since the junction conditions of the internal and external neutron star spacetimes relate the tidal charge to the brane tension and the energy density ( mass and radius ) of the neutron star , we can , in principle , also put restrictions on the allowed values of the brane tension @xcite .",
    "there is a variety of papers related to both weak - field @xcite and strong - field @xcite optical lensing phenomena in the braneworld black hole spacetimes .",
    "the optical phenomena connected to the accretion disc radiation could also reflect in a relevant way the influence of the tidal charge @xcite .",

    "high - frequency quasiperiodic oscillations ( qpos ) observed in galactic low - mass binary systems , namely , in both the black hole @xcite and neutron star binary systems @xcite , or in extragalactic black hole sources @xcite , represent such an interesting phenomenon in the strong field regime enabling estimates of the tidal charge on the basis of orbital models .",
    "it is widely accepted that the high - frequency qpos are related to the orbital motion in the inner part of an accretion disc around a compact object .",
    "there are strong indications that some resonant phenomena could be relevant in both black hole systems where twin peak qpos with fixed frequencies and their ratios are observed @xcite , and neutron star systems with wide spread of frequencies and their ratios where the twin peak qpos are cumulated around small number ratios @xcite .",
    "the hypothetical resonances of the orbital epicyclic oscillations representing plausible models of qpos were recently studied for brany kerr black holes @xcite . here , we study these models as related to the brany neutron stars described approximately by the rn spacetimes , i.e. , neglecting the effects related to rotation of neutron stars .",
    "we focus our attention to the relativistic precession model @xcite that fits qualitatively well in the wide spread data given by observations of a variety of neutron star binary systems @xcite .",
    "however , recently it has been discussed in the case of the atoll source 4u  1636@xmath453 @xcite and some other atoll sources @xcite that the resonant phenomena should be relevant even in the framework of the relativistic precession ( rp ) model .",
    "we , thus , present a first study of strong - field phenomena for brany neutron stars that could be compared with the weak - field results ( perihelion precession , radar echo delay and light deflection ) based on the rn solutions used to describe approximately the spacetime in the vicinity of sun @xcite . in order to obtain rough restrictions on both the brany tidal charge and brane tension",

    "we see that , in contrast to its positive values , the negative tidal charge tends to increase the horizon radius ( see , e.g. , ) .",
    "it is clear that the positive tidal charge acts to weaken the gravitational field , and we have the same horizon structure as in the usual reissner  nordstrm solution .",

    ", it follows from equation   that the horizon radius @xcite @xmath42 such a situation is not allowed in the framework of general relativity .",
    "the event horizon does exist provided that @xmath43 , where the equality corresponds to the extreme case . for @xmath44 we obtain a naked singularity spacetime .",

    "we stress that to model the data of twin peak qpos in neutron star systems , we can use the rp model , but the direct epicyclic frequency model gives trends just opposite to what is observed .    using the rp model , we can conclude that the resonant points are located in the region between the marginally stable orbit and the local extremum of the epicyclic frequency , i.e. , in the innermost part of the accretion disc .",
    "the frequency ratios @xmath224 , observed in the z - source circinus x-1 @xcite could still be explained in the framework of the rp model , but the resonant points must be located above the maximum of the radial epicyclic frequency .",
    "the fitting of the observational data will be discussed in the following section , but for our rough estimates we shall concentrate on the behaviour of the frequency - frequency relations , postponing the detailed studies of the resonant phenomena in individual sources to future studies .      here , we would like to mention some special resonance conditions that could be realized in the rn spacetimes of the naked singularity type .",
    "for rn naked singularity spacetime with @xmath225 , the keplerian and radial epicyclic frequencies could be equal at a specific radius ( see ) .",
    "the condition @xmath226 implies the relation @xmath227 determining in an implicit way the strong resonant radii , where the resonance between the oscillations with keplerian and radial epicyclic frequencies could be strongest , and the frequency scatter allowed for the resonance is largest . the function @xmath228 is illustrated in .",
    "note , however , that the above relation is not relevant in case of neutron star systems .",
    "we have summarized the twin peak qpos data for the atoll sources and z - sources sco x-1 and circinus x-1 in using the data accumulated in @xcite .",
    "clearly , there is a general tendency in the @xmath189@xmath190 frequency relations that can be immediately deduced from the observational data : @xmath199 decreases with @xmath190 ( @xmath189 ) increasing as stressed in the previous section .",
    "we shall use the most frequent rp model in order to obtain rough restrictions on the allowed values of the tidal charge ( and brane tension ) related to neutron star systems giving the observational data demonstrated in .    assuming that the trend observed in the frequency relations passing through the clusters of the neutron star twin peak khz qpos",
    "is related to the modes of the rp model , we make two kinds of fitting the data by the brany neutron star models . from these fittings",
    "we deduce rough constraints to the tidal charge and brane tension related to the neutron star systems generating the observed data .",
    "first , we assume negative values of the brany tidal charge ( and positive brane tension @xmath229 ) and consider any rp model with values of @xmath3 touching any observational point .",
    "thus , we exclude the values of @xmath3 that correspond to the rp frequency relations located outside the observational data ( see ) .",
    "the results are characterized by @xmath230 and @xmath231 ( see ) .",
    "assuming the canonical neutron star mass @xmath232 , we obtain the acceptable interval of tidal charge @xmath233 as demonstrated in .",
    "second , we allow both positive and negative values of @xmath1 ( and brane tension @xmath8 ) .",
    "such a case we represent by an estimate done in a symmetric way , i.e. , we find such a neutron star mass that the observational data are scanned for this mass parameter by rp fit relations with brany tidal charge of the same size in both positive and negative values ; we have found @xmath234 and @xmath235 as demonstrated in . enables us to limit our consideration to the rn naked singularity type spacetimes with the same behaviour of the keplerian and radial epicyclic frequencies as in the black hole spacetimes ; for example , the strong resonance radii are irrelevant . ]",
    "the presented results are used to obtain estimates on restrictions of the tidal charge @xmath25 using the relation @xmath236 we then obtain the following restrictions :    1 .   assuming negative tidal charge with @xmath237 and @xmath238",

    "we obtain for @xmath243 and @xmath244 the estimate @xmath245 that is naturally lower in comparison with the previous two cases because of the scatter of @xmath1 into both positive and negative values that reduces the magnitude of the dimensionless tidal charge by a factor of @xmath246 .",
    "the brane tension can be estimated using the relation  , which yields @xmath247 that can be transformed to the relation @xmath248 using the limit on compactness of the uniform configuration @xmath249 , where @xmath250 is implicitly given as a function of @xmath1 by relation  , we arrive at the general estimate on the brane tension : @xmath251 for the canonical values of the neutron stars , namely @xmath232 , @xmath252 and @xmath253 , we find @xmath254 in order to make a more precise restriction of @xmath8 , we have to estimate the dimensionless surface radius @xmath255 of the configuration for given @xmath256 and @xmath257 . for @xmath258 , the estimate should be related to @xmath88 , for @xmath259 we have to use @xmath84 .",
    "we find @xmath260 for @xmath238 , @xmath237 and choosing @xmath261 , we find @xmath262 which is comparable to our simple canonical estimate  . for @xmath243 , @xmath244 and choosing @xmath263 , we find @xmath264 this estimate exceeds the canonical one by a factor of @xmath265 because of the lowering of the dimensionless tidal charge limit .",
    "using the rp model of khz qpos observed in neutron star x - ray binaries modified by the hypothetical tidal charge of the neutron stars as implied by the braneworld uniform star model , we are able to put rough restriction on the tidal charge magnitude and brane tension magnitude related to the considered group of atoll sources and some z - sources .",
    "this is the first attempt at an estimate coming from the consideration of effects in the extremely strong gravitational fields .",
    "the presented method is rough but robust , since the effects of neutron star rotation are not important .",
    "according to , the effect of the tidal charge is given by the term @xmath266 .",
    "on the other hand , the leading term giving rotational effects is @xmath267 and , moreover , the limits on the rotational parameters taken from observed rotational frequencies of neutron stars @xcite put a strong limit of @xmath268 , so that its influence onto the character of the fitting frequency - frequency curves is small as shown by trk et al .",
    "of course , fitting the observational data of individual sources by precise methods will need the rotational parameter for fine tuning .    assuming negative values of @xmath25 and positive values of @xmath8",
    ", we obtained rough estimates @xmath269 and @xmath270 for both @xmath271 and the canonical case of neutron stars with @xmath272 . on the other hand ,",
    "from the limits allowing both positive and negative values of @xmath1 ( @xmath8 ) , starting from the standard mass estimate @xmath273 related to qpos @xcite , we obtained a lower estimate of @xmath274 , but higher values of @xmath275 .",
    "these values should be confronted with estimates given by bhmer et al .",
    "@xcite , concerning the effects of tidal charge in the limit of weak gravitational field related to the solar system .",
    "they considered the perihelion precession ( mercury ) , deflection of light near the edge of sun , and the radar echo delay experiment .",
    "clearly , the most convenient for comparison seems to be the first phenomenon , being of the same nature as the epicyclic motion of blobs in the relativistic precession model .",
    "the weak field restrictions are @xcite @xmath276 note that the rough strong field regime model gives estimates of the tidal charge higher than the weak field regime in more than two orders of magnitude .",
    "however , as stressed in @xcite , a substantial part of the perihelion shift could correspond to the effect of solar oblateness , modifying thus , in principle , very strongly the estimates of @xmath25 and @xmath8 . on the other hand ,",
    "the restrictions implied in @xcite by the light deflection and radar echo delay are @xmath277 and @xmath278 , which are substantially , by orders , higher than those given by rough estimates of qpos observational data in x - ray binaries .",
    "we can thus conclude that the restrictions on @xmath279 and @xmath280 implied by rough fitting of the neutron star x - ray binaries khz qpos data , i.e. , in the strong gravitational field regime , give better fits as compared to those implied by the weak - field limit , if these results are not masked by the effects of the solar oblateness .",
    "clearly , further and more detailed studies of all these phenomena are necessary .",
    "moreover , there is a variety of other vacuum solutions of spherically symmetric static field on the brane @xcite that deserve attention and have to be tested separately since the weyl tensor in the complete 5d theory is unknown yet .",
    "we plan to make further , more sophisticated comparisons of the plausible khz qpos models for neutron star x - ray binaries , including the rp model and the resonance disc oscillation ones , and compare these models with data obtained for individual sources .",
    "precise fitting of these individual source data to the models including the influence of the tidal charge could , in principle , bring some new interesting results and limits on the tidal charge and brane tension although we can not expect substantial shift of the rough estimates presented here , but rather better fits of observational data and more realistic estimates of the neutron star mass , more close to the expected canonical value .",
    "in fact , generally , we can conclude that the presence of a negative tidal charge enables lowering of the neutron star mass as can be seen from our rough estimates .",
