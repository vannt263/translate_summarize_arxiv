    "since the discovery by dijkgraaf and vafa , we have recognized that non - perturbative aspects of four - dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories can be studied via matrix models . in this framework the effective superpotential for @xmath0 supersymmetric gauge theories can be determined as the large @xmath5 free energy of a matrix model @xcite , and by minimizing it the non - perturbative vacua and their phase structures can be investigated @xcite .",

    "the non - planar diagrams have been shown to correspond to the gravitational corrections to the gauge theory @xcite , in particular , the genus one free energy of the matrix model computes the gravitational f - term @xmath6 recently , there has been much progress in the analysis of @xmath4 gravitational f - terms in terms of the multi - instanton calculations @xcite and geometric engineering @xcite . to compare them with the matrix model results ,",
    "it is essential to know the precise form of the gravitational f - terms computed using the matrix model . for the pure gauge theory case",
    ", it has been checked that the torus free energy @xmath7 coincides with the topological partition function @xcite of the donaldson - witten theory , and hence the @xmath4 gravitational f - terms @xcite .",
    "the planar free energy is also known to contribute to the gravitational corrections @xcite .",
    "this framework can be extended to @xmath0 supersymmetric gauge theories with @xmath8 flavors in the fundamental representation @xcite .",
    "the dual matrix model consists of a bosonic matrix and vectors which correspond to the adjoint scalar @xmath9 and @xmath8 flavor fields @xmath10 , @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) of the gauge theory , respectively . in the vector coupled matrix model ,",

    "in particular , we derive in section 3.4 a compact formula for the annulus contributions in terms of the prime form on the matrix model curve .",

    "the appendices contain some technical details which we need in the text .",
    "the original proposal of dijkgraaf and vafa@xcite was summarized as follows :    * the low energy effective superpotential of @xmath0 gauge theories can be computed by summing over the planar diagrams of the matrix model with the same tree - level potential . *",
    "the non - planar diagrams compute the gravitational f - terms for these theories .",
    "the first statement was proven in @xcite , and was generalized to the cases with flavors in @xcite .",
    "the latter part was also supported by many arguments @xcite , and was explicitly confirmed in the pure gauge theory cases @xcite .",

    "it is useful to consider how they arise in string theory .",

    "the string world - sheet can end either on @xmath5 compact or @xmath8 non - compact branes in the calabi - yau direction .",
    "resorting to the fermion zero - mode arguments @xcite , we can conclude that only the planar string world - sheets with at most one boundary ending on the non - compact branes can contribute to the effective superpotential @xcite .",
    "a simple combinatorial argument then yields the effective superpotential ( [ eff pot ] ) where the sphere and disk free energies of string theory are identified with those of the matrix model .",
    "the gravitational f - term corrections are given by inserting rr vertex operators on the bulk of the string world - sheet .",
    "a candidate for such an operator is the self - dual gravitino vertex operator @xcite @xmath49 due to the chiral ring relations @xmath50 at most two @xmath51 insertions can contribute to the gravitational f - term corrections .",
    "such @xmath52 terms are given by the torus ( figure [ torus ] ) as well as the planar world - sheet corrections ( figure [ 3annular ] ) .",
    "in particular , there are three types of planar world - sheets depending on which ( compact or non - compact ) branes the string ends on .",
    "the gravitational f - term containing @xmath52 takes the form @xmath53 where @xmath54 ( @xmath55 the planar @xmath56 torus gravitational corrections ) is the contribution from the @xmath57 string world - sheets .. ] if we further consider a self - dual graviphoton background @xmath58 , then we also have gravitational f - terms from the graviphoton fields .",
    "such f - terms are obtained by decomposing @xmath4 gravitational f - terms into the @xmath0 f - terms .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the superstring computation of these feynman diagrams is identical to that in the field theory limit , and the combinatorial factors can be calculated in the associated matrix model .    in the following sections , we will derive a formula for the free energy @xmath54 .",
    "there are three kinds of planar diagrams which contribute to the @xmath2 correction ( figure [ 3annular ] ) .",
    "the first and second types of contributions are determined by the sphere and the disk free energies through the following combinatorial arguments : for the unbroken gauge group case ( one - cut case ) , the coefficient of planar gravitational corrections yields @xmath59 for the first type , and @xmath60 for the second type .",
    "@xmath61 and @xmath62 are the symmetric factors of feynman diagrams with @xmath63 boundaries for the sphere and disk topologies , respectively .",
