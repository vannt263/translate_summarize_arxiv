    "this paper shows that local values of internal energy and enthalpy within a moist atmosphere can be better computed so as to study the energy and enthalpy directly for global / local domains .",
    "difficulties encountered in the past were due to a paradox : the budget equation of temperature was easier to compute than the local values of enthalpy , whereas it was easier to compute the local values of entropy than to solve the budget equation .",
    "one example of this paradox is given by the conservation or imbalance properties of internal energy @xmath2 ( see appendix  a ) or for the enthalpy @xmath3 .",
    "it is important to evaluate observed changes in radiative forcing and imbalance properties for energy fluxes , in order i ) to properly assess observed climate change impacts and ii ) to improve our ability to understand energy changes in the climate system at regional scales . in studying the conservation of energy in nwp models and gcms , it is common to assess global energy fluxes from the surface to the top of the atmosphere using re - analysis products .",
    "conservation and/or imbalance properties are thus currently monitored via the computation of fluxes of energy at the surface and the top of the atmosphere rather than by directly computing regional or global integrals of energy throughout the atmosphere .    ]",
    "another example of this paradox appears when the enthalpy equation is used in nwp models or in gcms .",
    "the enthalpy equation is never written in terms of @xmath4 , with the specific enthalpy @xmath5 to be evaluated at each grid - point .",
    "it is recalled on the left side of fig.([fig_barycentric ] ) that the enthalpy equation can be written in terms of @xmath6 or @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the temperature and @xmath9 the moist - air specific heat .",
    "these properties are consequences of material derivatives applied to barycentric motions of open parcels of fluid described by de groot and mazur ( 1962 ) or glansdorff et prigogine ( 1971 ) and applied by marquet ( 1993 ) , zdunkowski and bott ( 2004 ) and catry _ et al . _",
    "( 2007 ) , among others .",
    "it is recalled below that most of the present moist - air formulae for @xmath5 and @xmath10 were derived using the hypothesis of closed parcels of fluid .",
    "the problem concerning the knowledge of reference values for @xmath5 or @xmath10 can be briefly illustrated by starting with the dry air enthalpy written as @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "this is a valid expression provided that the specific heat @xmath12 is assumed to be a constant for @xmath8 close to @xmath13 and @xmath14 is associated with @xmath13 .",
    "the enthalpy of a clear - air parcel of moist air is computed as the sum of @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is computed with @xmath12 and @xmath14 replaced by @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "since the term of @xmath19 in brackets is multiplied by @xmath20 , it can be neglected either if @xmath21 is a constant or if the bracketed term is equal to zero , i.e. if @xmath22 .",
    "but , in fact , this is not valid .",
    "it is only if @xmath21 is a constant that changes in enthalpy or entropy can be easily computed , with no need to determine reference values for enthalpies and entropies .",
    "the above properties are only valid if the parcels of fluid are closed .",
    "there are , however , circumstances in which it is necessary to compare absolute values of enthalpy or entropy .",
    "this is true particularly when open systems are considered and if parcels of fluid are not connected by barycentric motion .",
    "this is illustrated on the right side of fig.([fig_barycentric ] ) .",
    "it is not possible to transform @xmath23 into @xmath24 for these independent parcels since the reference values of @xmath5 and @xmath10 are multiplied by varying terms , all of which depend on @xmath21 . in consequence ,",
    "spatial integrals , vertical fluxes and 3d gradients must be computed by using absolute definitions for @xmath5 and @xmath10 .",
    "accordingly , richardson ( 1922 ) and businger ( 1982 ) , hereafter referred to as r22 and b82 , searched for relevant choices for zero entropy and enthalpy for both dry air and water species .    a way to compute the specific moist - air enthalpy",
    "can be found by examining the other aspect of the paradox , concerning the entropy .",
    "it is shown in the following sections that it is impossible to compute all the terms forming the entropy budget equation .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to use the third law of thermodynamics to compute the moist air entropy in an absolute way , as explained in hauf and hller ( 1987 ) and marquet ( 2011 ) .",
    "this is done by setting the zero of entropies for the most stable crystalline form of all atmospheric species at @xmath0  k.    this paper explores new possibilities for computing and analyzing isenthalpic or isentropic processes in open systems , defined by @xmath25constant or @xmath26constant .",
    "this is equivalent to setting @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( using barycentric formalism for the enthalpy and entropy equations ) .",
    "direct local definitions for @xmath5 and @xmath10 may allow the study of new classes of processes associated with open systems .",
    "they include the impact of diffusion of water on @xmath5 or @xmath10 ( entrainment and detrainment at cloud edges ) , and/or the impact of evaporation of water from the surface .",
    "for instance , it is reported in m11 that moist - air entropy is constant within the whole boundary layer of marine stratocumulus , with almost no jump in @xmath10 at the top of the boundary layer .",
    "these properties could only be observed with the open - system formulation derived in m11 , since large vertical gradients and jumps are observed for @xmath21 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 with marine stratocumulus .",
    "other examples of new applications can be found in marquet and geleyn ( 2013 ) and marquet ( 2013 ) , where the moist - air brunt - visl frequency and potential vorticity are defined in terms of absolute values of the specific moist - air entropy derived in m11 .",
    "these moist - air quantities are computed with the help of vertical and 3d gradients of @xmath10 , and thus depend on relevant absolute definitions for the reference entropies of dry air and water vapour .",
    "it is worth noting that the search for absolute and local definitions for @xmath5 and @xmath10 does not correspond to new definitions for the well - known potential temperatures @xmath31 , @xmath30 or @xmath29 .",
    "it is shown in following sections that the absolute formulation of m11 must be understood as being a generalization to open systems of the two specific entropies derived in pauluis _",
    "( 2010 , hereafter referred to as p10 ) , which correspond to the ( pseudo- ) adiabatic potential temperatures @xmath30 or @xmath29 .",
    "the important issue in this paper is to determine which kind of enthalpy might be defined in an absolute way .",
    "it is assumed that this is possible for the `` thermal '' enthalpies , which correspond to those enthalpies for n@xmath32 , o@xmath32 and h@xmath32o substances that are generated by the variations of @xmath33 generated by progressive excitations of the translational , rotational and vibrational states of the molecules , and by the possible changes of phase represented by the latent heats ( with negligible impact of changes of pressure ) .    both entropy and thermal enthalpy are thermodynamic state functions .",
    "therefore , both of them can be computed following any possible reversible path that connects the dead state at @xmath0  k and the actual atmospheric states .",
    "the third law of thermodynamics can be used to set the entropy to zero for the dead states corresponding to the most stable cryogenic substances at @xmath0  k. it is assumed that the same hypothesis can be applied for thermal enthalpies at @xmath0  k provided that the fluid is free of chemical or nuclear reactions .    the paper is organized as follows",
    ". section  [ subsection_dhdt_dtdt ] explains in some detail why the enthalpy equation can be transformed into the temperature equation , with no impact of the reference values for enthalpies .",
    "the importance of these reference values for computing the turbulent enthalpy fluxes is then illustrated in section  [ subsection_enthalpy_fluxes ] using results from b82 .",
    "some impacts of reference values on the computations of moist - air entropy are described in section  [ subsection_specific_entropy ] , where the essential results of m11 are recalled .",
    "comparisons between the moist - air entropy derived in m11 and those described in p10 are presented in section  [ subsection_entropy_p10 ] .",
    "following r22 , it is explained , in section  [ subsection_richardson ] , why it is possible to apply nernst s result ( namely the third law of thermodynamics ) to compute the water entropies of moist air . in section  [ subsection_unit_mass_dry_air ] , it is shown that the method of computing moist - air enthalpy or entropy `` per unit mass of dry air '' does not obviate the need to determine the reference values of moist - air species in the case of open systems .",
    "a review of different moist static energies is briefly presented in section  [ subsection_mse ] in order to list these well - known quantities , which are often considered to be similar to the sum of the moist - air enthalpy and the potential energy .",
    "section  [ section_data_method ] corresponds to the data and method part of the paper .",
    "the general formula for the specific moist - air thermal enthalpy is derived in section  [ subsection_enthalpy ] .",

    "the properties of the moist - air thermal enthalpy diagrams are analysed in section  [ subsection_s_h_diagrams ] .",
    "numerical values of the thermal enthalpy are computed and plotted in section  [ subsection_h_tmse_profiles ] for several stratocumulus and cumulus case studies ( see appendix  c ) .",

    "other applications are suggested for the various findings presented in this paper .",
    "the enthalpy and temperature equations are described in some detail because reference will be made to them in later sections .",
    "the enthalpy equation can be written as @xmath35 equation  ( [ def_barycentric_1 ] ) is the development of the material derivative of the implicit weighted sum @xmath36 , where the index @xmath37 applies to for dry air ( @xmath38 ) , water vapour ( @xmath39 ) , liquid water ( @xmath40 ) and ice ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "it is assumed that it is possible to write @xmath42 for each species , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are constant terms attributed to each gas .",
    "equation  ( [ def_barycentric_2 ] ) @xmath45 is obtained from the properties @xmath46 ( no impact of @xmath44 ) , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "external changes @xmath49 are created by the divergence of the diffusion fluxes @xmath50 , where @xmath51 represent departures from the barycentric mean @xmath52 .",
    "internal changes @xmath53 are created by phase changes of water .    the first law equation ( [ def_barycentric_3bis ] )",
    "is expressed in terms of barycentric motion of an open parcel of fluid . @xmath54",
    "the term involving change in pressure represents the expansion work .",
    "the divergence of the enthalpy flux @xmath55 is separated into two parts in ( [ def_barycentric_3 ] ) , with @xmath56 equal to the external changes @xmath57 .",
    "the heating rate @xmath58 corresponds to other diabatic processes ( mainly radiation ) .",
    "the temperature equation @xmath59 is then obtained by subtracting ( [ def_barycentric_3 ] ) from ( [ def_barycentric_2 ] ) and using the result @xmath60 ( no impact of @xmath44 ) , which leads to ( [ def_barycentric_4 ] ) .",
    "@xmath61 the terms depending on external changes cancel out in the difference ( [ def_barycentric_2 ] ) minus ( [ def_barycentric_3 ] ) .",
    "the implicit sum depending on the diffusion fluxes @xmath50 acts in regions where gradients of temperature exist .",
    "the implicit sum depending on internal changes represents the impact of phase changes of water .",
    "it can be written as @xmath62 , in terms of the vaporization , sublimation and fusion rates .    therefore all the terms in ( [ def_barycentric_4 ] ) can be easily computed and there is no need to determine the absolute values for enthalpies to express the first law in terms of the temperature equation . it is also possible to compute @xmath63 , since it is equal to @xmath64 and since the sum @xmath65 is known .",
    "these results correspond to the first part of the paradox .      the problem of finding relevant values for the reference enthalpies @xmath66 is explicitly addressed in b82 , where the specific enthalpies are written as @xmath42 ( as in the previous section ) , corresponding to the definitions @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "it is a usual practice in atmospheric science to set reference enthalpies of dry air equal to zero for a given reference temperature , typically for @xmath69c .",
    "the choices of zero - enthalpy for water species are more variable .",
    "it is set to zero either for the water vapour or for the liquid water enthalpies , for the same reference temperature @xmath70c and with the latent heats obviously connecting the other water - enthalpies through @xmath71 or @xmath72 .",
    "it is shown in b82 that the choices of zero - enthalpies for both dry air and liquid water are is in agreement with well - established procedures for computing surface turbulent fluxes .",
    "otherwise , additional fluxes of @xmath21 would have to be added , leading to other definitions of the moist - air enthalpy flux . the same hypothesis @xmath73 is used in the review by fuehrer and friehe ( 2002 ) and for @xmath69c .",
    "it is , however , unlikely that such arbitrary fluxes of @xmath21 may be added to or subtracted from the enthalpy flux , leading to arbitrary closure for the computation of turbulent fluxes of moist air .",
    "the same is true for the vertical integral and the horizontal or vertical gradients of @xmath5 , for which terms depending on @xmath21 could be of real importance if @xmath21 is not constant .",
    "accordingly , one of the aims of the coming sections will be to better justify these assumptions concerning the reference values of partial enthalpies , and possibly to define them more accurately for any value of the reference temperature @xmath13 .",
    "another motivation for the search for accurate definitions of moist - air enthalpy ( or entropy ) is to try to answer the following question illustrated on the right side of fig.([fig_barycentric ] ) : is it possible to determine whether two parcels of fluid have the same local values of @xmath5 or @xmath10 ?",
    "it is easy to answer to this question for the motion of closed parcels of moist - air , for which @xmath21 is a constant and the @xmath44 may be cancelled , or for pseudo - adiabatic motion , for which it is possible to rely on the differential equations given by saunders ( 1957 ) or iribarne and godson ( 1973 ) .",
    "these differential equations are established without the need for precise definitions of partial entropies .",
    "these adiabatic or pseudo - adiabatic processes correspond to the definitions of the well - known liquid - water , equivalent and wet - bulb potential temperatures @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "accordingly , the search for absolute and local definitions for @xmath5 and @xmath10 does not correspond to a change in the definitions of @xmath29 , @xmath30 or @xmath31 and the corresponding real temperatures . a new way to answer these questions and to compute the specific moist - air `` thermal enthalpy '' will be found by examining the other aspect of the paradox , concerning the entropy , with the term `` thermal '' explained in the following sections .",
    "the other aspect of the paradox concerns the entropy : it is easier to compute the local values of entropy than to manage its budget equation . like the enthalpy equation ( [ def_barycentric_3 ] ) ,",
    "the entropy equation derived by de groot and mazur ( 1962 ) is suitable for open systems . as in section  [ subsection_enthalpy_fluxes ] , the gibbs equation ( [ def_gibbs_1 ] ) is expressed for barycentric motion with diffusion fluxes @xmath50 and with the local gibbs function defined by @xmath74 .",
    "@xmath75 the first law expressed by ( [ def_barycentric_3 ] ) can be introduced in ( [ def_gibbs_1 ] ) , leading to the entropy equation ( [ def_gibbs_2 ] ) .",
    "a term @xmath76 should appear on the right hand side of ( [ def_gibbs_2 ] ) but it is equal to zero if it is assumed that changes of phases of water species are reversible and occur at equal gibbs potential @xmath77 between the two phases .",
    "this excludes the possibility of supercooled water for instance .    the first reason why it is difficult to evaluate the entropy equation accurately is due to another term , @xmath78 , which should be added into the right hand side of ( [ def_gibbs_2 ] ) in order to take account of other sources of irreversibility that exist in the real atmosphere .",
    "an entropy equation similar to ( [ def_gibbs_2 ] ) is derived in p10 for the simplified case of moist air composed of dry air , water vapour and liquid water ( no ice ) .",
    "this equation can be rewritten as @xmath79 where the implicit sum @xmath80 in ( [ def_gibbs_2 ] ) is expressed in ( [ def_p10_dsdt ] ) in terms of the rate of change of @xmath81 and @xmath82 due to diffusion of water vapour and precipitation processes , denoted @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "the impact of the diffusion term depending on @xmath85 is not taken into account in ( [ def_p10_dsdt ] ) .",
    "another reason why it is difficult to evaluate the entropy equations ( [ def_gibbs_2 ] ) or ( [ def_p10_dsdt ] ) accurately is due to the barycentric view , which corresponds to a unit mass of moist air .",
    "the consequence is that external input or output of @xmath81 or @xmath82 must be balanced at the expense of opposite changes in the moist - air value @xmath10 .",
    "this explains the two terms that multiply @xmath83 and @xmath84 in ( [ def_p10_dsdt ] ) , while @xmath10 is approximated by @xmath86 in p10 .",
    "it is thus important to determine the absolute value of @xmath10 in order to compute , from ( [ def_p10_dsdt ] ) , the impact of diffusion of water ( entrainment and detrainment at the edges of clouds ) , or the evaporation of water from the surface .",
    "the same is true if the aim is to determine the impact of these processes on @xmath5 starting from the enthalpy equation ( [ def_barycentric_3 ] ) .",
    "it is possible to by - pass these difficulties .",
    "the aim is to compute @xmath10 directly , without trying to compute @xmath87 via the associated source - sink terms .",
    "following hh87 , it is explained in m11 that it is indeed possible to compute the specific moist - air entropy by determining the reference values from the third law , which states that the entropy of any substance is equal to zero for the most stable crystalline form of the substance and at absolute zero temperature ( the third law can not be applied to liquids or gases ) .",
    "a third - law - based formulation for the specific moist - air entropy @xmath10 is written in m11 as @xmath88 both @xmath89 and @xmath12 are constant terms and the entropy potential temperature @xmath90 depends on the adimensional parameter @xmath91 \\:/ c_{pd}$ ] .",
    "this parameter must be evaluated from the reference values of the partial entropies of dry - air and water - vapour components .",
    "it is important to notice that the two notions of `` reference '' and `` standard '' entropies correspond to different numerical values .",
    "the reference values @xmath92 and @xmath93 are associated with the reference temperature @xmath13 , the total pressure @xmath94 , the liquid - water saturation pressure @xmath95 and the water - vapour mixing ratio @xmath96 .",
    "these reference values are determined according to the standard values @xmath97 and @xmath98 which correspond to the same standard values for temperature and pressure for all species , with for instance @xmath99  c ( or @xmath100  c ) and @xmath101  hpa , even for water vapour .",
    "the third - law standard values of specific entropies are available in thermodynamic tables for all atmospheric species .",
    "the values recalled in appendix  a and computed with the datasets of appendix  b are the same as those used in hh87 and m11 ( see the end of section  [ subsection_std_h ] ) .",
    "the aim of the study is thus to arrive at a formulation for the moist - air enthalpy , @xmath5 , that would be similar to results ( [ def_m11_s ] ) and ( [ def_m11_thetas ] ) valid for the moist air entropy , @xmath10 .      since the aim of the article is to compute the moist - air enthalpy by determining the reference and standard enthalpies for each species , it is important to explain why the same method is relevant for the moist - air entropy and how it is possible to recover the well - known formulae used in atmospheric science and based on the equivalent and liquid - water potential temperatures @xmath30 and @xmath29 , respectively .",

    "this means that it is not possible to compute relevant spatial averages , fluxes or gradients of @xmath112 and @xmath113 , because the link between @xmath30 or @xmath29 and the moist - air entropy must change in space and in time .",

    "moreover , systematic differences exist on figure  [ fig_t_qt_h_psychro ] : the curves of constant @xmath5 are located between the curves of constant mse@xmath160 and mse@xmath163 , whereas the curves of constant @xmath166 are more different and are located above the others . the closed system assumption and the use of arbitrary definitions for the reference enthalpies explain the differences observed between the curves plotted with @xmath5 and with other mse quantities .",
    "in the same way that moist entropy is expressed in m11 in terms of @xmath383 up to a constant entropy reference value , moist - air thermal enthalpy is expressed in terms of @xmath384 up to a constant enthalpy reference value .",
    "the potential temperature @xmath90 and the enthalpy temperature @xmath174 are thus equivalent to the specific moist - air entropy ( @xmath10 ) and thermal enthalpy ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "thermal enthalpies are generated by variations of @xmath33 with @xmath8 corresponding to progressive excitations of the translational , rotational and vibrational states of the molecules , and by possible changes of phase represented by latent heats ( with negligible impact of changes of pressure ) .",
    "the original feature is that both @xmath174 and @xmath90 depend on standard values of enthalpies and entropies , via the terms @xmath385 and @xmath386 , respectively . in this paper , standard values",
    "are determined with an error of a few percent for the cryogenic properties of the dry - air and water - components of moist air .",
    "different choices for these standard values would generate other values for @xmath174 and @xmath90 .",
    "the use of cryogenic values for the specific heats of solid and liquid phases , in addition to latent heats when changes of phases occur , eliminate the issue of referring to the perfect gas law when the temperature is too low .",
    "the important feature in the definition of @xmath5 and @xmath10 is that the specific contents of the moist - air components multiply several constant terms which depend on the reference values @xmath13 or @xmath94 .",
    "this leads naturally to additional varying terms depending on @xmath21 .",
    "it is for this reason that the standard values @xmath240 , @xmath241 , @xmath98 and @xmath97 must determined for varying @xmath21 . this explains why the third law versions for @xmath5 and @xmath10 are different from the ones obtained in dvm75 , e94 or p10 , where only quantities per unit of dry - air are considered and where hypotheses like @xmath387 , @xmath388 , @xmath389 or @xmath382 are made at a temperature different from @xmath0  k. this suggests that the third law of thermodynamics may have an important and somewhat surprising physical meaning when moist - air thermodynamics is considered",
    ".    the constant volume or constant dry - air point of view may be useful for laboratory experiments , but it is not relevant to isolate the dry - air part from a moving open moist - air parcel with multiple components .",
    "the specific value approach is more suitable for applications to a barycentric view and to equations of compressible fluids .",
    "this may explain some of the differences between the present third law results and previous ones .",
    "it has been shown that the enthalpy temperature is expressed in terms of the quantity @xmath228 , which depends on the difference between the standard values of dry - air and water - vapour enthalpies ( in the same way as the moist entropy depends , via @xmath386 , on the difference between the standard values of dry - air and of water - vapour entropies ) .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath228 is a constant term independent of the reference temperature @xmath13 .",
    "this means that the same property observed by entropy in m11 is also valid for the thermal enthalpy , i.e. they are both independent of the choice made for the reference temperature and pressure @xmath13 and @xmath94 .",
    "since they are well - defined local quantities , it becomes possible to use specific values of thermal enthalpy or entropy to compute local budgets , integral or mean values of @xmath5 and @xmath10 , either in space or time .",
    "a more surprising result concerns the assumption that generalized enthalpy might be roughly represented by mse@xmath163 or mse@xmath160 .",
    "it is shown that it is serendipitous since : i ) the numerical values of standard enthalpies of dry air and liquid water are close to each other ; and ii ) @xmath274 is a large dominant term of @xmath228 .",
    "it is shown in m11 that no such coincidence exists for the entropy , thus explaining the large impact of the new term @xmath386 introduced for the entropy computations . however , even if mse@xmath163 or mse@xmath160 might be considered as relevant approximations of @xmath319 ( at least for non - saturated conditions ) , they do not follow the same internal liquid - ice symmetry as in the case of the specific moist - air enthalpy formulation .",
    "the enthalpy diagram illustrates the possibility of representing all the thermodynamic properties of moist air as a function of @xmath5 , @xmath390 and @xmath21 alone , as in pauluis and schumacher ( 2010 ) who suggest using the set ( @xmath10 , @xmath390 , @xmath21 ) to compute any of the basic variables ( @xmath8 , @xmath390 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath199 ) .",
    "it is thus possible to use the first- or second - law set of variables ( @xmath5 , @xmath390 , @xmath21 ) or ( @xmath10 , @xmath390 , @xmath21 ) as prognostic variables .",
    "this is true for les models where each grid cell represents a homogeneous parcel of moist air ( as long as the pressure is known , in spite of non - hydrostatic processes ) .",
    "this result is no longer valid for a parcel subject to sub - grid variability .",
    "all properties of a parcel in nwp models or gcms are understood as weighted sums of properties observed for a given fraction of unsaturated air plus the other part from saturated air ( with weighting factors depending on cloud fractions ) .",
    "however , the method of representing moist - air properties by ( @xmath10 , @xmath390 , @xmath21 ) or by ( @xmath5 , @xmath390 , @xmath21 ) may be used even in nwp models or gcms , provided that : it is i ) applied separately for each of the unsaturated and saturated fractions of moist air , and ii ) the values of cloud fraction can be determined by some other processes .",
    "it thus becomes possible to compute and study the tendencies of @xmath5 or @xmath10 generated by various processes ( dynamics , radiation , convection , turbulence ) and to compare the results with reanalysis outputs .",
    "an alternative method could consist of evaluating the finite differences @xmath391 at each point , or @xmath392 , with the specific thermal enthalpy or entropy computed with zero values at @xmath0  k.    another application concerns pure isenthalpic processes , as plotted on psychrometric charts .",
    "it is shown in this paper that , depending on how the specific enthalpy is defined , the isenthalpic lines are different .",
    "since there is only one kind of isenthalpic process in the real world , it might be valuable to compare the new thermal enthalpy versions involving real processes and/or observations .",
    "the differences between mse quantities and @xmath319 are analysed for several cumulus and stratocumulus vertical profiles .",
    "mse@xmath163 is greater , and mse@xmath160 smaller , than the generalized enthalpy @xmath319 in moist conditions .",
    "these systematic differences of more than @xmath176% may have significant physical implications for the accurate determination of the moist thermal enthalpy within clouds .",
    "they may modify results from analyses of the impact of drying or moistening processes on @xmath5 , and therefore on local temperature .",
    "this confirms the striking results obtained when referring to the enthalpy diagrams , and suggests that the formulation of thermal enthalpy ( [ def_h_bis ] ) should be used to compute moist enthalpy or energy budgets accurately .",
    "this may be important for the validation of nwp models and/or gcms , when the budget of thermal enthalpy simulated by these models is compared with those obtained from climatology or reanalyses .",
    "all of the above suggests new possible applications for the third law formulation of entropy and thermal enthalpy .",
    "it may be used to study dry - air entrainment and moist - air detrainment occurring along cloud edges , as well as the conservative properties used when parameterizing shallow or deep - convection . for the latter phenomena ,",
    "mse quantities should be replaced by the specific generalized enthalpy @xmath319 .",
