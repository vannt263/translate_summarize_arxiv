    "the magnetic moment is one of the fundamental properties of the nucleon .",

    "the magnetic moment is usually the first to check against the experimental data . to understand",
    "how well a particular version of lattice qcd can simulate the internal structure of the nucleon , the magnetic moment is an observable that one must study after the nucleon mass .",
    "theoretical computations of the nucleon magnetic moment using lattice qcd techniques have been performed by a number of groups on lattices of different physical sizes and lattice spacings with different nucleon sources ( interpolating fields ) @xcite-@xcite .",
    "most calculations done so far have used the quenched approximation . and",
    "almost all calculations begin with the lattice calculations of sach s magnetic form - factor @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , at discrete values of the momentum transfer @xmath6 .",
    "the magnetic moment is just @xmath4 at @xmath7 which can not be obtained more directly in this approach because the relevant off - forward matrix element is linearly proportional to @xmath8 .",
    "the lattice magnetic momentum is obtained usually by extrapolating these discrete values at finite @xmath9 to @xmath10 .    however , there are potential problems in the @xmath9 extrapolation , mainly due to the finite volume effects . on a finite lattice ,",

    "this corresponds to @xmath22 . at this scale ,",
    "the nucleon form factors are very sensitive functions of @xmath9 .",
    "indeed @xmath23 increases from @xmath24 to @xmath7 by almost a factor of 3 .",
    "therefore , an extrapolation across this range of @xmath9 must be strongly model dependent if without any prior knowledge of the @xmath9 dependence of the nucleon form factors @xcite .",
    "fortunately , the experimental data shows that the @xmath9-dependence of the nucleon form factors can be fitted to a dipole form .",
    "moreover , in a limited @xmath9 range , the dipole form is not too different from a monopole .",
    "therefore , we find in the literature both forms are commonly used to fit the lattice data @xcite .",

    "however , as the quark masses approach the chiral limit ( @xmath139 reaches @xmath140 @xcite ) , the statistics require many more lattice configurations , and hence the error bars increase markedly for a fixed number of configurations .",

    "point sources are used to create the nucleon : interpolating field @xmath143 is placed on a well - defined initial lattice point , called 0 , and twelve different sources with different color and dirac indices are used to start the conjugation gradient .",

    "we average the three - point and two - point functions separately using this method for 100 configurations and put already averaged values in the final formulas for the magnetic moment and quark total angular momentum .",

    "there are a number of factors which can account for this discrepancy .",
    "one is the use of the quenched approximation . we will report a full dynamical calculation in a future publication .",
    "another is the lattice quark masses .",

    "al . demonstrated that as the pion mass approaches zero , the magnetic moment shows a steep rise as a result of chiral singular contributions . in our calculations , we observe an opposite trend : the magnetic moment decreases along with the lattice quark masses .",
    "this is seen in the calculation of the form factors at finite momentum transfers and a number of other observables @xcite .",
    "we suspect strongly that this is a finite volume effect which will go away when we increase the physical dimension of the lattice by 50% or so .",
    "the results for the quark total angular momentum contribution to the nucleon spin are shown in table [ tam ] . in this case ,",
    "our results are quite consistent with those in ref .",
    "@xcite , although we have avoided the use of the extrapolation in @xmath9 . for instance , our result @xmath154 at @xmath155 from the connected diagram can be compared with @xmath156 at @xmath157 in @xcite . the leading chiral contribution to this quantity",
    "was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and is not strong .",
    "as the quark mass approaches the chiral limit , the lattice result shows a slight decrease , although the large error bars prevent a clear - cut comparison .    although the quark angular momentum from the connected diagram accounts for nearly all of the spin of the nucleon , there are other contributions which can not be neglected .",
    "for instance , the sea contribution through the disconnected diagrams is expected to quench the connected result , resulting a total quark angular momentum accounting for about half of the nucleon spin @xcite .",
    "the contribution of the disconnected diagrams represents one of the possible corrections to the nucleon magnetic moment and quark total angular momentum presented in the previous subsection .",
    "the disconnected insertion is shown in fig.@xmath144[fig:3 ] .",
    "disconnected diagrams are difficult to calculate in general because they involve the closed - loop contributions resulting from the self contractions of the quark fields in an observable .",
    "an efficient method to obtain the matrix elements is the noise theory discussed in refs.@xcite-@xcite , explained as follows .",
    "consider a set of random sources @xmath158 satisfying @xmath159 the total number of sources @xmath160 is a key parameter controlling the desired statistics . in this work , the random sources @xmath158 are created by putting @xmath161 or @xmath162 randomly on every lattice point for every dirac and color index .",
    "three - point functions for the disconnected diagrams can now be expressed as : @xmath163 m^{-1}(y , z ) \\eta^l(z ) \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath164 or @xmath165 , @xmath166 is green s two - point function , and @xmath167 is a wilson - fermion propagator .    unfortunately , this method requires a large @xmath160 to obtain reasonable statistics , which is very expensive in practical simulations .",
    "it was discussed in refs.@xcite that the so - called expansion method can expedite the calculation significantly .",
    "the idea is to approximate the full fermion propagator , @xmath168 where @xmath169 $ ] by one that includes only the first few terms in the small @xmath139 expansion , @xmath170 one then writes @xmath171 .",
    "the first term , @xmath172 , can be calculated directly without conjugation gradient , and the remainder , @xmath173 , is computed by the noise method discussed above . because the remaining contribution is small , the number of random sources needed for the required statistics is considerably reduced .    in this study , we keep ten terms in @xmath174 . the remainder is calculated with 30 random sources .",
    "the results are obtained only for the smallest @xmath145 because even in this case the disconnected contribution to the magnetic moment has almost @xmath175 error .",
    "for the quark total angular momentum , the result is more stable and the error is about @xmath176 .",
    "our final result for the disconnected diagram is @xmath177 .",
    "this agrees with @xcite @xmath178 .",
    "the negative contribution cancels part of the result from the connected diagram .",
    "we have no simple explanation for the sign .",
    "in this paper , we report a lattice qcd calculation of the nucleon magnetic moment and the fraction of the nucleon spin carried in the quark total angular momentum .",
    "we use the standard wilson formulation for fermions and 100 quenched configurations in the monte carlo evaluations of the feynman path integrals .    our results for the magnetic moment can not be compared directly with the experiment yet .",
    "we are uncertain , for example , about the systematic error caused by the quenched approximation , large lattice quark masses , and the finite volume effect .",
    "the smallest quark mass in our calculations is about @xmath179 ( @xmath155 ) which is about ten times larger than the physical quark mass .",
    "the pion mass dependence of the magnetic moment has been studied recently in refs .",
    "@xcite . in these papers ,",
    "a strong dependence on the pion ( quark ) mass in the region @xmath180 is suggested .",
    "a phenomenological chiral extrapolation of the previous lattice results to the physical pion mass gives results consistent with experimental values .",
    "one interesting finding of this study is that the magnetic form factors , magnetic moment , and the quark total angular momentum decrease with the quark masses .",
    "the most plausible explanation is that when the quark mass becomes lighter , the nucleon size grows , and the present lattice volume can not fully accommodate a physical nucleon .",
