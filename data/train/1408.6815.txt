    "@xmath0 is obtained from the boundary of a regular neighborhood of @xmath2 by pinching each edge to create a vertex of degree 4 .",
    "an example is given in figures [ graph ] and [ medial ] .",
    "the construction is important in knot theory , since any diagram of a link can obtained from a suitable plane graph @xmath2 by resolving each vertex of @xmath0 in one of two ways so that one arc of the diagram appears to pass over the other .",
    "( see figure [ link ] . ) in this way , questions about knots and links can be converted into the language of graph theory .",
    "indeed , many invariants of the link can be computed directly from @xmath2 ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the most basic invariant of a link @xmath3 is the number of its components , denoted here by @xmath4 .",
    "notice that @xmath4 is the same for all links associated to a medial graph @xmath0 , regardless of how the vertices are resolved .",

    "a more intrinsic formula appears in @xcite :    the _",
    "mod-2 laplacian _ matrix of a graph @xmath2 is the matrix @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the degree of the @xmath8th vertex , while for @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the number of edges between the @xmath8th and @xmath11th vertices .",
    "all entries are taken modulo 2 .",
    "the following theorem is proved in @xcite .",
    "[ main ] let @xmath3 be a link arising from a medial graph @xmath0 by resolving vertices .",
    "the number @xmath4 of components of @xmath3 is the nullity of the mod-2 laplacian matrix @xmath12 .    as observed in @xcite ,",
    "both the tutte polynomial and the laplacian matrix determination of @xmath13 show that @xmath4 is independent of the planar embedding of @xmath2 .",
    "theorem [ main ] is part of topology s folklore .",
    "it is provable by indirect , non - elementary techniques of algebraic topology .",
    "one begins with the observation that @xmath12 is the ",
    "unreduced mod-@xmath1 goertiz matrix \" of the link @xmath3 , a matrix shown by h. seifert @xcite and r.h .",
    "kyle @xcite to be a presentation matrix for @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the 2-fold cyclic cover of @xmath16 branched over @xmath3 ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the rank of @xmath17 is known to be @xmath18 ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "hence the nullity of @xmath12 is @xmath4 .",
    "the complete argument can be found in @xcite .    a combinatorial proof of theorem [ main ] is given in chapter 17 of @xcite .",
    "it draws on substantial material about cut , flow and bicycle spaces contained in earlier chapters .",
    "a proof given in @xcite is more direct , making explicit the connection between the mod-@xmath1 laplacian matrix of @xmath19 and the components of the medial graph @xmath20 .    here",
    "we add an idea of conservative vertex - coloring , motivated by knot theory , to give an extremely short and self - contained proof of theorem [ main ] .",
    "the idea has been adapted for locally - finite periodic graphs in @xcite .",
    "the authors wish to thank iain moffatt and lorenzo traldi for helpful suggestions .",
    "a _ flat _ @xmath21 is a finite collection of immersed circles in the plane that are in _ general position _ ( that is , at any intersection point , the two tangent vectors span the plane ) .",
    "two flats are _ equivalent _ if one can be changed into the other by a finite sequence of _ flat reidemeister moves _ , shown in figure [ flat ] .",
    "such moves are understood to performed locally , fixing any points not shown .",
    "we also allow homeomorphisms of the plane , which permit deformations such as bending and stretching .",
    "flats are produced by link diagrams by projection .",
    "not surprisingly , flat reidemeister moves were inspired by well - known reidemeister moves of link diagrams in the plane .",
    "( both sets of moves are described in @xcite ) .",
    "we leave it as the first of two elementary exercises to show that any flat @xmath21 is equivalent to a collection of circles that bound pairwise disjoint embedded disks in the plane .",
    "we call the number of circles the _ component number _ of @xmath21 , and we denote it by @xmath22 .",
    "it is clearly well defined .",
    "given a flat @xmath21 , we associate a vector space @xmath23 over the field @xmath24 by means of a presentation .",
    "the generators correspond to the bounded regions of @xmath25 . at each crossing",
    "we impose the relation that the sum of the generators corresponding to the regions meeting there is zero .    for the second exercise",
    ", one verifies that if two flats differ by a flat reidemeister move , then the corresponding vector spaces are isomorphic .",
    "consequently , @xmath23 has dimension @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath2 be a plane graph , @xmath0 its medial graph . by resolving vertices , various diagrams of links are possible .",
    "they all have @xmath26 components , where @xmath26 is the component number of the underlying flat @xmath21 .",
    "checkerboard shade the regions of @xmath27 with the unbounded region unshaded .",
    "then @xmath2 can be identified with the graph having a vertex in each shaded region and an edge running through each crossing .",
    "recall that a vector space @xmath23 is associated to @xmath21 by means of a presentation @xmath28 . by _ shaded _ ( resp .",
    "_ unshaded _ ) _ generators _ of @xmath28 we mean generators corresponding to shaded ( resp .",
    "unshaded ) regions of @xmath27 .",
    "we identify shaded generators with vertices of @xmath2 , and the unshaded generators with faces of @xmath2 .",
    "since the unbounded region corresponds to the trivial element , it is easy to see from the relations that the shaded generators alone generate @xmath23 .    a _",
    "vertex coloring _ is an assignment of colors in @xmath24 to the shaded generators .",
    "it is _ conservative _ if it extends over unshaded regions to give an element of @xmath23 .",
    "if a vertex coloring extends , then it does so uniquely .",
    "hence we can count the elements of @xmath23 by counting conservative vertex colorings .",
    "assume that @xmath29 is a vertex of @xmath2 with valence @xmath30 .",
    "let @xmath31 be the vertices adjacent to @xmath29 .",
    "( we allow repetition in the case of multiple edges . )",
    "let @xmath32 ( resp .",
    "@xmath33 ) be colors assigned to to @xmath29 ( resp .",
    "@xmath34 ) .",
    "one checks that if the vertex coloring is conservative , then the @xmath30 relations @xmath29 imply : @xmath35 @xmath36",
    "conversely , if the above conditions hold at every vertex , then the coloring is a conservative vertex coloring . to prove this",
    ", it suffices to show that the coloring extends to the unshaded regions in a way that is consistent with all relations . for this , consider a path from the unbounded region to any unshaded region @xmath37 , intersecting edges of @xmath2 transversely .",
    "determine colors for the unshaded regions inductively : as the path leaves a region labeled @xmath38 and crosses an edge of @xmath2 with vertices labeled @xmath39 and @xmath40 , assign @xmath41 to the unshaded region that the path enters .",
    "then the relation holds at the crossing corresponding to that edge .",
    "we call @xmath41 the result of _ integrating along the path_. the conditions ( [ first ] ) and ( [ second ] ) imply that if we integrate around a small _ closed _ path surrounding any vertex , then initial and final colors agree .",
    "consequently , integrating along any two paths from the unbounded region to @xmath37 yields the same result .",
    "since the path can be taken to cross any given edge , all relations are satisfied .",
    "if @xmath3 is any link associated to @xmath0 by resolving vertices , then the _ dehn presentation _ of @xmath42 has generators corresponding to the bounded regions of @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the diagram of @xmath3 , and relations as in figure [ dehn ] .",
