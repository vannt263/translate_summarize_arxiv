    "we find : @xmath76 throughout this phase , @xmath74 ( just like in the na ii phase ) . at @xmath17 ,",
    "the generating function takes the particularly simple form @xmath77 [ a completely filled band of free fermions ] .",
    "we notice a remarkable property of the a phase : throughout this phase , @xmath78 .",
    "this means that the correlations of the jordan  wigner operators ( [ jordan - wigner - ising ] ) [ where @xmath79 denote now the @xmath80 components @xmath81 decay slower than exponentially . this property was described in ref .   as `` confinement of dual domain walls '' , and it can also be understood in the fermionic language . at @xmath75 , fermions form a completely filled ( or completely empty ) band , and the anisotropy terms ( involving @xmath19 ) introduce local cooper pairs , which , however , change the number of particles by two .",
    "thus the expectation value of the jordan  wigner parity string @xmath30 is only affected by cooper pairs intersecting one of the end points of the string ( @xmath44 or @xmath33 ) .",
    "but , since pairs are local , the number of such pairs remains finite for long strings , which leads to a saturation of the correlations @xmath30 at large @xmath33 .",
    "the counting phase diagram of the xy chain ( fig .",
    "[ fig : two - phase - diagrams]b ) coincides with that obtained from spin correlations : different phases are distinguished by the transverse long - range order , presence or absence of incommensurate oscillations in spin correlations and by pre - exponential factors in exponentially decaying spin correlations @xcite .",
    "this coincidence is not surprising , since , by the jordan  wigner transformation , transverse spin operators @xmath82 are represented by the product of the string operator ( [ jordan - wigner - ising ] ) and a fermion operator @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "transverse spin correlations are given by the toeplitz determinants which differ from eqs .",
    "( [ toeplitz - det ] ) and ( [ sigma - symbol ] ) only by a shift of the winding number ( and by fixing @xmath14 ) @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : two - phase - diagrams]b also resembles those based on efp in ref .   and on entanglement entropy in ref .",
    "indeed , the efp is given by the same toeplitz determinant ( [ toeplitz - det ] ) , ( [ sigma - symbol ] ) with @xmath83 @xcite , and the entanglement entropy depends on the spectrum of a closely related block toeplitz matrix @xcite . therefore the phase boundaries which are determined by the geometry of the square - root branching points in eq .",
    "( [ sigma - symbol ] ) coincide in all the three problems .",
    "however the fcs classification contains additional details related to the positions of @xmath9-dependent logarithmic branching points in eq .",
    "( [ szego-1 ] ) .",
    "finally , we remark that , even though the xy spin chain considered in our work maps onto a quadratic fermionic system , it does not obey the theorem on factorization of fcs for noninteracting fermions of ref .  :",
    "the phase na ii with a singularity at an intermediate value of @xmath9 would not be allowed by that theorem .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is that the corresponding fermionic system contains pairing terms @xcite , and the theorem of ref .",
    "is not , in general , valid for quadratic hamiltonians with pairing ( see also discussion in the supplementary material of the last paper of ref .  ) .",
    "thus the na ii phase presents an example of an _ interacting _ system with singularitites of @xmath0 shifted away from @xmath14 .",
    "our theory of counting phase transitions is closely related to the approach of lee and yang considering zeros of the partition function in the complex plane of a parameter of the model ( fugacity or magnetic field ) @xcite .",
    "namely , in many ( but not all ) situations , the counting phase transitions are determined by the locations of zeros of the partition function in the complex fugacity ( or magnetic - field ) plane .",
    "consider first the case of a classical system .",
    "then the generating function ( [ chi - sigma ] ) can be understood as the partition function of the system with the imaginary part @xmath84 added to the chemical potential dual to the observable @xmath3 in the subsystem @xmath1 .",
    "thus we study the same analytic continuation of the partition function as lee ",
    "yang s one , but with a different order of thermodynamic limits . in lee ",
    "yang theory , the chemical potential acquires a uniform imaginary component in the whole system , and then the system size tends to infinity .",
    "in contrast , in our construction , the system size is infinite from the very beginning , it is only the subsystem @xmath1 where the chemical potential has an imaginary part , and the thermodynamic limit is defined by expanding the subsystem @xmath1 within the same infinite system .",
    "we believe that in most situations this difference in the order of the thermodynamic limits is unimportant and the extensive part of the generating function @xmath0 simply equals the lee  yang partition function per unit cell of the system . in this case",
    ", the counting phase diagram and the positions of singularities of @xmath0 can be easily read off the locus of the lee ",
    "yang zeros in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the irrelevance of the order of the thermodynamic limits can be most easily understood in the case of one - dimensional classical systems : there , both @xmath0 and the asymptotic behavior of the lee  yang partition function in the thermodynamic limit are given by the leading eigenvalue of the corresponding transfer matrix .",
    "this connection to lee ",
    "yang zeros was also discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of `` dynamical phase transitions '' .    in the case of a quantum system ,",
    "the relation to the locus of lee  yang zeros is more complicated . here",
    "one should distinguish two possibilities : either the observable @xmath3 ( defined for the full system ) commutes with the hamiltonian @xmath85 or it does not .    in the case of @xmath3 commuting with @xmath85 , the lee - yang partition function @xmath86 may be related to the fcs generating function for the full system in the grand - canonical ensemble , just like in the classical case discussed above : @xmath87 ( here @xmath88 is the inverse temperature ) .",
    "therefore , one may draw the same relation between the locus of lee  yang zeros and counting phase transitions as in classical systems , provided the order of the thermodynamic limits is unimportant .",
    "the latter is , however , not always the case , at least for systems with sufficiently slowly decaying correlations .",
    "an example where the lee ",
    "yang approach and fcs give different results is one - dimensional fermions at zero temperature ( equivalent to the spin-1/2 xy chain considered in section [ sec : spin - chain ] at @xmath17 ) .",
    "there , the fcs approach leads to a well defined generating function @xmath0 @xcite , while the lee ",
    "yang approach provides neither a good locus of zeros nor a good thermodynamic partition function per unit cell of the lattice .",
    "the question about the general conditions under which the two orders of the thermodynamic limit are equivalent , goes beyond the scope of the present paper , and we leave it for future studies .    finally , in the case of @xmath3 not commuting with @xmath85 ( which applies to our example of spin-1/2 xy chain in section [ sec : spin - chain ] at @xmath89 ) , the relation ( [ leeyang - fcs ] ) between the lee  yang partition function and full counting statistics no longer holds , and we conclude that there is no obvious relation between the two approaches .",
    "we have proposed a classification scheme of thermodynamic phases and correlations in general in terms of the analytical properties of the extensive part of fcs for a suitably chosen discrete observable .",
    "using fcs for describing correlations involves nonlocal observables ( [ chi - sigma ] ) and therefore allows us to capture subtle details of correlations inaccessible with local observables . in this way ,",
    "_ counting phases _ may be distinguished : sometimes they coincide with conventional thermodynamic phases , but sometimes one thermodynamic phase may be further subdivided into several counting phases reflecting differences in statistics of fluctuations of a certain discrete variable .",
    "the physical meaning of counting phase transitions is often subtle . in some situations it is related to the structure of zeros of the partition function in lee ",
    "yang theory , and in one - dimensional situations we relate fcs physics to the correlations of nonlocal string observables of jordan  wigner type .",
    "deeper physical implications of these counting phase transitions are still to be understood .    in our work , we have illustrated our proposal with two simplest examples : one - dimensional ising model as a classical example and spin-1/2 xy model as a quantum one .",
    "we have chosen those examples , since they allow an analytical calculation of the counting phases and an easy comparison with other available results .",
    "studying counting phases in systems with more complicated interactions is interesting but requires more involved analytical or numerical methods .    in general ,",
    "the role of interactions in counting phase transitions is not yet fully understood . while it has been shown in ref .",
    "that fermionic systems in the absence of interactions can only exhibit singularities in @xmath0 at real negative @xmath90 , the absence of interactions is not a necessary condition for this property .",
    "indeed , for the spin-1/2 xy chain at a finite anisotropy @xmath19 ( see section [ sec : spin - chain ] ) both phases with singularities at @xmath14 and those with singularities at @xmath91 are present .    finally",
    ", we remark that here we have only focused on analytic properties of the generating function @xmath0 at real values of @xmath9",
    ". it may also be instructive to analyze , more generally , the structure of singularities of @xmath0 in the complex plane of @xmath90 .",
    "this would , on one hand , provide a closer connection to the theory of lee  yang zeros @xcite , and on the other hand , relate it to the theory of the emptiness formation probability @xcite .",
