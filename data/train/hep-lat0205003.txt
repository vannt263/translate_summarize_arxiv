    "a main question in qcd is the existence of special classes of gauge fields which are responsible for confinement . in the framework of the dual superconductor ,",
    "color magnetic monopoles arise as the appropriate candidates .",
    "their investigation necessitates a projection of the non - abelian gauge theory on the compact u(1 ) theory . in lattice computations",
    "it was demonstrated that monopoles account for more than 90 percent of the string tension in the confinement and they drop toward zero across the phase transition .",
    "the study of chaotic dynamics of classical field configurations in field theory is motivated by phenomenological applications as well as by the understanding of basic principles .",
    "the role of chaotic field dynamics for the confinement of quarks is a longstanding question . here , we analyze the leading lyapunov exponents of compact u(1 ) configurations on the lattice .",
    "the real - time evolution of the classical field equations was initialized from euclidean equilibrium configurations created by quantum monte carlo simulations .",
    "the u(1 ) gauge field is decomposed into a monopole and photon part . this way we expect to learn some details between the appearance of monopoles and the strength of chaotic behavior in lattice simulations .",
    "we have investigated @xmath0 u(1 ) gauge theory described by the action @xmath1 with @xmath2 and @xmath3 at critical coupling @xmath4 u(1 ) gauge theory undergoes a phase transition between a confinement phase with mass gap and monopole excitations for @xmath5 and the coulomb phase with a massless photon for @xmath6 , see fig .",
    "[ poly_abs_u1 ] .",
    "we are interested in the relationship between monopoles of u(1 ) gauge theory and classical chaos across this phase transition . following refs .",
    "@xcite , we have factorized our gauge configurations into monopole and photon fields .",
    "the u(1 ) plaquette angles @xmath7 are decomposed into the `` physical '' electromagnetic flux through the plaquette @xmath8 and a number @xmath9 of dirac strings passing through the plaquette @xmath10 where @xmath11 $ ] and @xmath12 is called a dirac plaquette .",
    "monopole and photon fields are then defined in the following way @xmath13 @xmath14 here @xmath15 acts on @xmath16 , the quantities @xmath9 and @xmath17 are defined in eq .",
    "( [ dirac_string_def ] ) and @xmath18 is the lattice coulomb propagator .",
    "one can show that @xmath19 is up to a gauge transformation identical with the original @xmath20 defined by @xmath21 .",
    "chaotic dynamics in general is characterized by the spectrum of lyapunov exponents .",
    "these exponents , if they are positive , reflect an exponential divergence of initially adjacent configurations . in case of symmetries inherent in the hamiltonian of the system",
    "there are corresponding zero values of these exponents . finally negative exponents belong to irrelevant directions in the phase space : perturbation components in these directions die out exponentially .",
    "pure gauge fields on the lattice show a characteristic lyapunov spectrum consisting of one third of each kind of exponents  @xcite . assuming this general structure of the lyapunov spectrum we investigate presently its magnitude only , namely the maximal value of the lyapunov exponent , @xmath22 .",
    "the general definition of the lyapunov exponent is based on a distance measure @xmath23 in phase space , @xmath24 in case of conservative dynamics the sum of all lyapunov exponents is zero according to liouville s theorem , @xmath25 .",
    "we utilize the gauge invariant distance measure consisting of the local differences of energy densities between two @xmath26 field configurations on the lattice : @xmath27 here the symbol @xmath28 stands for the sum over all @xmath29 plaquettes , so this distance is bound in the interval @xmath30 for the group su(n ) . @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the familiar plaquette variables , constructed from the basic link variables @xmath33 , @xmath34 located on lattice links pointing from the position @xmath35 to @xmath36 .",
    "the generators of the group are @xmath37 with @xmath38 being the pauli matrices in case of su(2 ) and @xmath39 is the vector potential . the elementary plaquette variable is constructed for a plaquette with a corner at @xmath40 and lying in the @xmath41-plane as @xmath42 .",
    "it is related to the magnetic field strength @xmath43 : @xmath44 the electric field strength @xmath45 is related to the canonically conjugate momentum @xmath46 via @xmath47    the hamiltonian of the lattice gauge field system can be casted into the form @xmath48.\\ ] ] here the scalar product stands for @xmath49 .",
    "the staple variable @xmath50 is a sum of triple products of elementary link variables closing a plaquette with the chosen link @xmath51 .",
    "this way the hamiltonian is formally written as a sum over link contributions and @xmath50 plays the role of the classical force acting on the link variable @xmath51 .",
    "initial conditions chosen randomly with a given average magnetic energy per plaquette have been investigated in past years  @xcite . in the present study",
    "we prepare the initial field configurations from a standard four dimensional euclidean monte carlo program on a @xmath52 lattice varying the inverse gauge coupling @xmath53  @xcite .",
    "we relate such four dimensional euclidean lattice field configurations to minkowskian momenta and fields for the three dimensional hamiltonian simulation by identifying a fixed time slice of the four dimensional lattice .",
    "we start the presentation of our results with a characteristic example of the time evolution of the distance between initially adjacent configurations .",
    "an initial state prepared by a standard four dimensional monte carlo simulation is evolved according to the classical hamiltonian dynamics in real time . afterwards",
    "this initial state is rotated locally by group elements which are chosen randomly near to the unity .",
    "the time evolution of this slightly rotated configuration is then pursued and finally the distance between these two evolutions is calculated at the corresponding times .",
    "a typical exponential rise of this distance followed by a saturation can be inspected in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] from an example of u(1 ) gauge theory in the confinement phase and in the coulomb phase .",
    "while the saturation is an artifact of the compact distance measure of the lattice , the exponential rise ( the linear rise of the logarithm ) can be used for the determination of the leading lyapunov exponent .",
    "the left plot exhibits that in the confinement phase the original field and its monopole part have similar lyapunov exponents whereas the photon part has a smaller @xmath54 .",
    "the right plot in the coulomb phase suggests that all slopes and consequently the lyapunov exponents of all fields decrease substantially .",
    "we now turn to a comparison with the monopole density in u(1 ) quantum field configurations , @xmath55 the left plot of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] exhibits for a statistics of 100 independent configurations that @xmath56 decreases sharply between the strong and the weak coupling regime .",
    "it can be seen that the photon part from the decomposition carries also a few monopoles .",
    "the main result of the present study is the dependence of the leading lyapunov exponent @xmath22 on the inverse coupling strength @xmath53 , displayed in the right plot of fig .",
    "as expected the strong coupling phase , where confinement of static sources has been established many years ago by proving the area law behavior for large wilson loops , is more chaotic .",
    "the transition reflects the critical coupling to the coulomb phase . the right plot of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows that the monopole fields carry lyapunov exponents of nearly the same size as the full u(1 ) fields .",
    "the photon fields yield a non - vanishing value in the confinement ascending toward @xmath57 for randomized fields which indicates that the decomposition ( [ decompeq ] ) works perfectly for ideal configurations only .",
    "an interesting result concerning the continuum limit can be viewed from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] which shows the energy dependence of the lyapunov exponents for the u(1 ) theory and its components .",
    "one observes an approximately linear relation for the monopole part while a quadratic relation is suggested for the photon part in the weak coupling regime . from scaling arguments",
    "one expects a functional relationship between the lyapunov exponent and the energy @xcite @xmath58 with the exponent @xmath59 being crucial for the continuum limit of the classical field theory .",
    "a value of @xmath60 leads to a divergent lyapunov exponent , while @xmath61 yields a vanishing @xmath62 in the continuum .",
    "the case @xmath63 is special leading to a finite non - zero lyapunov exponent .",
    "our analysis of the scaling relation ( [ scaling ] ) gives evidence , that the classical compact u(1 ) lattice gauge theory and especially the photon field have @xmath64 and with @xmath65 a regular continuum theory .",
    "the monopole field signals @xmath66 and stays chaotic approaching the continuum .",
    "we investigated the classical chaotic dynamics of u(1 ) lattice gauge field configurations prepared by quantum monte carlo simulation .",
    "the fields were decomposed into a photon and monopole part .",
    "the maximal lyapunov exponent shows a pronounced transition as a function of the coupling strength indicating that on a finite lattice configurations in the strong coupling phase are substantially more chaotic than in the weak coupling regime .",
    "the computations give evidence that the lyapunov exponents in the original u(1 ) field and in its monopole part are very similar .",
    "the situation for the monopole density is analogous and serves as a consistency check of the decomposition .",
    "we conclude that classical chaos in field configurations and the existence of monopoles are intrinsically connected to the confinement of a theory .",
    "we found evidence that the monopole fields stay chaotic in the continuum while the photon fields and the full u(1 ) fields possess a regular continuum theory .",
    "so far the monopoles are extracted from the euclidean gauge fields .",
    "it will be interesting to compute their counterparts in minkowski space and perform an analysis concerning monopole annihilation .",
