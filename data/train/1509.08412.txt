    "understanding the behavior of o vacancy defects ( v@xmath1 ) in reducible metal oxides is of paramount importance to understanding a wide range of highly interesting physical and chemical effects .",
    "these include oxide catalysis for sustainable co@xmath0 conversion into chemical fuels , highly efficient batteries for sustainable energy storage and electromobility , and innovative electronic devices with the potential to fundamentally transform information technology .",
    "the latter is expected to be enabled by the memristor , a fascinating new electronic device that complements the widely known passive two - terminal devices of resistor , capacitor and inductance  @xcite .",
    "it acts as an ohmic resistance depending on the history of the current which has flown through it in the past  hence the name which is a contraction of memory and resistor .",
    "already proposed in the 1970s by chua  @xcite , the purposeful implementation of memristors could only be achieved in 2008  @xcite .",
    "memristors are being considered for two main applications : first , resistive switching memory will to scale far beyond current flash memory technology  @xcite , which relies on tunneling electrons to and from floating gates in cmos transistors . from this",
    "arises the possibility to shift computing paradigms away from the current compute centric von neumann architecture towards storage centric concepts  @xcite which avoid data transfer bottlenecks in the former .",
    "second , the memristor forms an indispensable building block of electronic analogues to nerve cells for neuromorphic computing  @xcite . without it ,",
    "modeling synaptic behavior requires extremely complex active electronics .",
    "this complexity severely limited the possible number of interlinks between artificial neurons , rendering the construction of powerful neuromorphic devices infeasible .",
    "recently , an artificial neuronal network was implemented in hardware , interlinking 576 artificial neurons in si based cmos by a matrix of 73728 artificial synapses realized by wo",
    "memristors on the same chip  @xcite .",
    "the device exhibits considerable learning ability and constitutes a significant advance in neuromorphic computing . at the same time",
    ", enormous effort is exerted in the development of resistive switching memory based on transition metal oxide memristors .",
    "laboratory devices already surpass speed and durability of flash memory cells  @xcite .",
    "the first material in which memristors were implemented was tio@xmath2 and it is still an enormously useful and interesting model system  @xcite .",
    "it is understood that the resistance modulation is based on the migration of oxygen vacancy defects and the formation and dissolution of conductive  @xcite magnli phases  @xcite which are based on planar arrangements of oxygen vacancies ( v@xmath1 ) in the rutile structure and have ti@xmath3o@xmath4 stoichiometry  @xcite .",
    "high precision theoretical calculations  @xcite have shown that electrical conductivity can be induced in rutile by different kinds of vacancy arrangements , bearing only marginal resemblance to magnli phases . however",
    ", this earlier study was limited to a small number of examined vacancy arrangements by the prohibitive computational cost of ab - initio methods that can describe the electronic structure of v@xmath1 in tio@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "still , combined with the finding that rutile is severely destabilized by oxygen deficiency , as evidenced by a pronounced reduction in melting temperature  @xcite , these results lead to an important question for the understanding of the memristive effect in transition metal oxides in general : is the observed formation of magnli phases prerequisite for the effect or is the resistance change caused by a larger class of structural features , with the magnli phase being the thermodynamically most favorable structure exhibiting these features ?    with an exhaustive ground - state search , attained by a density functional theory ( dft ) based cluster expansion ( ce ) approach , we shed light on that question . in this letter , we present the first systematic investigation of the full configuration space for v@xmath1  in tio@xmath0 rutile .",

    "ti@xmath3o@xmath4 magnli structures are made up of tio@xmath0 rutile blocks , which are periodically interrupted at ( 121 ) shear planes  @xcite . the crystallographic operation to move a rutile block from its perfect rutile position to its magnli phase position is ( 121)@xmath42_{\\text{rutile}}$ ] relative to its neighboring rutile block . by deleting overlapping oxygen atoms",

    "these approximatively planar arrangements alternate with narrow undisturbed rutile blocks . while in rutile the ti octahedra only share edges and vertices , in the characteristic shear planes of the magnli phases they share facets .    due to the substantial restructuring from rutile to a magnli phase ,",
    "as described above , extensive energy barriers are expected to hinder transformation into the energetically favorable state .",
    "none of the v@xmath1  defect structures considered in this ce study can relax into it .    since the cells that are tractable by dft in large numbers are limited in size , at low v@xmath1  concentration the large portions of undisturbed rutile between separating the v@xmath1  agglomerates can not be modeled . under these circumstances ,",
    "the vacant o sites are evenly distributed and separated by at least one occupied site in every direction . in this meta - stable arrangement",
    ", the vacancy retains its well known structure surrounded by three truncated tio octahedra , where the ti ions are regarded as being in the ti@xmath36 oxidation state .",
    "exemplarily , figure  [ fig : iso - vacancy - relaxed ] shows the relaxed geometry of the lowest energy structure at 5% v@xmath1  concentration .",
    "for the same reason , higher order magnli phases , constructed of v@xmath1  layers separated by thick layers of undisturbed rutile , are extremely challenging for computational modeling .",
    "still , from empirical experience , they are expected to be energetically favorable .       at higher vacancy concentrations ,",
    "we find ordering of vacancies in direct neighborhood on a wide variety , arranged along lines or within slip planes .",
    "the prototype of the energetically favorable defect structure is a v@xmath1  planar arrangement ( see figure  [ fig : layeredstructures ] ) , detected at 10% , 12.5% , and 16.7% v@xmath1 .",
    "prior to relaxation , this structure is characterized by two features ( fig .",
    "[ fig : layer - prototype ] ) : a ( 100 ) v@xmath1  double plane , ( i.e.  v@xmath1   double rows in [ 010 ] and [ 001 ] direction , ) formed by missing apex oxygen atoms formerly belonging to one ti octahedron , and an odd number of undisturbed ti octahedra in ( 100 ) direction .",
    "this structure relaxes into the geometry shown in figure  [ fig:1095relax ] .",
    "it is characterized by a layer of five - fold coordinated ti@xmath36 ions , linked by overcoordinated o@xmath44 ions .",
    "the atoms labeled ti@xmath45 are those missing two direct o neighbors in the prototype structure . as figure  [ fig:1095relax ] shows ,",
    "6-fold coordination is restored for these atoms .",
    "the layered arrangement of ti@xmath36 , ti@xmath45 and o@xmath44 found in the most favorable structures of our ce separate slightly shifted blocks of perfect rutile from each other .",
    "thus they are very similar to those found in the magnli phases  @xcite , lacking the strong atomic restructuring during formation compared to magnli phases .      analyzing the densities of states ( dos ) of the hse06 electronic structure calculations performed at the relaxed geometries , we find a very clear trend illustrated in figure  [ fig : dosplots ] : for evenly dispersed v@xmath1  ( see e.  g.  arrangement in fig .  [",
    "fig : iso - vacancy - relaxed ] ) , the electronic structure resembles that of isolated vacancies ( cf .",
    "[ fig:712dos ] ) . for dense v@xmath1  planes ( see e.  g.  arrangement in fig .  [",
    "fig : layeredstructures ] ) , we note the appearance of a broad , metallic interband close to the rutile conduction band ( fig .  [ fig:1095dos ] ) .",
    "this band provides high conductivity even at low temperatures .",
    "close examination of the projected dos shows , that the appearance of this metallic interband is caused by an overlap of defect states originating from ti@xmath36 in the v@xmath1  layer and states originating from nearby ti@xmath46 .",
    "in contrast , the low temperature form of the ti@xmath39o@xmath40 magnli phase exhibits a fully occupied band within the gap ( fig .",
    "[ fig : magnelidos ] ) .",
    "our results on the magnli phase are in very good agreement with previous calculations by liborio et  al .",
    "@xcite using dft+u .",
    "furthermore , they match nicely with the dos of ti@xmath0o@xmath41 determined by padilha et  al .  @xcite using dft+u and hse . since the latter study contains dos of higher order magnli structures , too , none of them shows a comparable clearly separated , non - magnetized defect band as the one in figure  [ fig : magnelidos ] .",
    "although our findings confirm the initial results of magyari - kpe et  al .",
    "@xcite , we interpret our results with a somewhat different focus .",
    "the prohibitive cost of sufficiently precise electronic structure calculations severely limited the structural search space of earlier studies and precluded cell shape relaxation .",
    "our approach , while still involving enormous computational effort and being limited to a certain configuration - space size , allows us to compare all structures of this configuration space instead of few handpicked samples .",
    "thus , we are able to directly prove that segregation of v@xmath1  in rutile tio@xmath2 into planes is favorable over a uniform distribution .    even though our present study is static in nature",
    ", the very high migration barriers found in bulk rutile  @xcite , combined with the fact that tio@xmath2 films used in existing devices are grown in the amorphous state , suggest that the transition is not _",
    "amorphous@xmath47rutile@xmath47magnli_. we rather expect the vacancy agglomeration to occur in a lower density phase , either amorphous or anatase ( the latter having been observed in situ  @xcite ) .",
    "this distinction , however small , may prove technologically very advantageous .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that for commercially viable application in nonvolatile memory , the reaction rate constants during switching must be several orders of magnitude larger than during storage or reading .",
    "the phase transition to a rutile based structure in the low resistance state , which leads to a strong raise in v@xmath1  migration barriers , facilitates achieving this difference . to understand , and possibly engineer , the switching process and storage behavior of memristive devices , it is paramount to first understand the static , highly stable on and off states .",
    "since we find meta - stable structures with a clearer metallic nature than magnli phases , promising better conductivity , it may be technologically beneficial to seek the formation of such a non - magnli structure .",
    "our approach to the cluster expansion simulation of v@xmath1  defects in tio@xmath0 is not limited to this specific application , but can be generalized to any situation where vacancy or substitutional defects can reside on a distinct sublattice of a compound material .",
    "the results concerning the v@xmath1  ordering in tio@xmath0 show a clear tendency for v@xmath1  segregation into planes with a very pronounced energy gap with respect to more disperse distributions .",
    "these configurations relax into structures where planes of ti@xmath36 ions are linked by o@xmath48 ions .",
    "due to technical constraints , such as limited cell sizes to sustain dft manageability and ionic relaxation algorithms not being able to overcome arising energy barriers , the experimentally found magnli defect planes , could not be reproduced in the ce study .",
    "having restored 6-fold coordination at every ti atom , the magnli structures constitute the ground state  also in this study .",
    "our detailed analysis based on precise electronic structure calculations shows that there is a definite positive correlation between the structural features of planar ti@xmath36 and o@xmath48 ions and the formation of a metallic density of states , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dosplots ] .",
    "interestingly , the magnli structure does not exhibit a metallic dos , but rather a characteristic deep band of occupied states .",
    "the meta - stable v@xmath1  arrangement shown in figure  [ fig:1095relax ] exhibits a much more pronounced metallic behavior than any magnli phase variant examined in our own work as well as earlier dft+u studies by liborio et  al .",
    "these findings suggest that the magnli phase is not necessarily a prerequisite for the high conductive state of a memristor . due to the relatively high v@xmath1  mobility compared to ti  @xcite",
    ", planar v@xmath1  aggregation may happen first , already causing distinct conductivity .",
    "subsequently , the actual ground state  the magnli phase  may arise by shifting the rutile layers among the v@xmath1  planes and finally form the long - lasting low - resistance state .",
    "further , the results cast some doubt upon the identification of the crystal structure of the conductive filaments in on - state memristor devices as magnli phases .",
    "the relaxed planar v@xmath1  arrangements are structurally very similar to the magnli phase .",
    "specifically , both phases exhibit the same arrangement of disturbed planes at the same inter - plane distances .",
    "this makes the distinction between the magnli phase and the planar v@xmath1  arrangements found in our ce calculations extremely challenging .",
    "in summary , we performed a broad and systematic study of the thermodynamics of v@xmath1  arrangements in rutile tio@xmath0 , combined with highly accurate electronic structure analysis of the most favorable structures .",
    "our results are in accordance with previous experimental reports indicating a preferential v@xmath1  segregation into planar arrangements  @xcite , and confirm the earlier hypothesis that these arrangements cause the observed high conductivity  @xcite .",
    "the magnli phase does not seem to be a mandatory prerequisite for the low resistive state of memristors . some contradictions between the calculated electronic structure of the magnli phase and observed metallic behavior point to two open fundamental questions : on the theoretical side , precise and detailed band structure calculations of the magnli phase are needed , while experimentally it must be endeavored to distinguish between the magnli phase and other planar v@xmath1  arrangements .",
