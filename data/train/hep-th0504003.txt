    "the construction of a lorentzian wormhole @xcite or time machine @xcite requires violation of the null energy condition ( nec ) : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the matter energy - momentum tensor and @xmath2 is any null - vector ( @xmath3 ) . for example , in a wormhole the throat geometry requires that converging null geodesics evolve into diverging null geodesics ( imagine the trajectories followed by light rays traversing the wormhole ) .",
    "the raychaudhuri equation for the expansion @xmath4 of a hypersurface orthogonal null congruence is  @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an affine parameter , @xmath7 the tangent vector field , and @xmath8 the shear .",
    "the first two terms on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ theta ] ) are negative , and after using the einstein equation to relate @xmath9 and @xmath10 , we see that @xmath4 can increase only if the nec is violated .",
    "in this paper we consider the exotic matter necessary to stabilize a traversable wormhole throat ( which may or may not be a time machine ) .",
    "our analysis focuses on constraining its properties , using the fact that it violates the nec and some additional assumptions about the throat spacetime .",
    "it is important to note that both the magnitude of @xmath11 and its violation of the nec must be large in order to construct a useful wormhole .",
    "roughly , a wormhole with throat diameter of order @xmath12 requires energy - momentum densities of order @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the planck length .",
    "taking @xmath12 to be of order meters requires energy - momentum densities greater than @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "similarly , it is easy to show using eq .",
    "( [ theta ] ) that the time required to travel through the wormhole is determined by the degree of violation of the nec .",
    "this travel time is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 . for travel time of order 1 year",
    ", this requires @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the exotic matter under consideration must exhibit large energy density and substantial violation of the nec .",
    "we define two types of wormholes ( or time machines constructed using wormholes ) , henceforth referred to as `` devices '' : those with semi - classical spacetimes ( type a ) and those with strongly fluctuating spacetimes ( type b ) .",
    "clearly , type a devices are preferable to type b as they can by definition be controlled more precisely , and perhaps pose less risk to users in their operation .",
    "unfortunately , we will show that all type a devices are unstable to small perturbations , so time travel or travel via wormhole is possible only via an intrinsically quantum device with a `` fuzzy '' spacetime .",
    "essentially , type a devices require exotic matter which behaves classically ( quantum effects are negligible in its dynamics ) , and classical matter which violates the nec is unstable @xcite .        by a semi - classical state @xmath19 we mean one whose probability distribution is peaked about its central value in a particular basis ,",
    "defined by some operator @xmath20 . in this case , @xmath21 up to small corrections ( assuming @xmath22 ) , and we say that @xmath19 is semi - classical with respect to the operator @xmath20 .",
    "this condition of semi - classicality is weaker than the usual one , which requires that eq .",
    "( [ z ] ) holds for _ all _ operators simultaneously .",
    "a state might , according to our definition , be semi - classical with respect to @xmath20 but not with respect to some other operator @xmath23 ( i.e. , it might exhibit large fluctuations in measurements of @xmath23 ) .",
    "for example , @xmath19 might be an eigenstate of @xmath20 , while @xmath24 \\neq 0 $ ] ( e.g. , let @xmath20 be the momentum operator and @xmath23 the position operator ) . a central issue addressed in this paper is whether the time evolution of a device which gives rise to a semi - classical , non - zero @xmath11 is well - approximated by the classical equations of motion , or equivalently , whether it is simultaneously semi - classical with respect to both the field operators @xmath25 and their conjugate momenta @xmath26 .",
    "if the time evolution of the exotic matter in the device is well - approximated by the classical equations of motion , we can apply a previous result @xcite , showing that in models built from gauge fields , scalars and fermions , any classical solution is unstable to small perturbations if it violates the nec . specifically , in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the kinetic term of the effective hamiltonian governing small fluctuations about a classical solution must exhibit a negative eigenvalue if the nec is violated .",
    "therefore , there exist infinitesimal perturbations involving local spatial gradients which lower the energy of the solution .",
    "in this section we discuss spacetime fluctuations @xcite , and argue that type a devices are necessarily semi - classical with respect to the matter energy - momentum tensor @xmath11 .",
    "it is useful to distinguish between `` active '' and `` passive '' metric fluctuations .",
    "active fluctuations are those involving quantum effects due to the graviton itself ; these are negligible as long as the spacetime curvature is small compared to the planck scale .",
    "we focus on passive fluctuations which are induced on the metric through the einstein equations @xmath27 by fluctuations in @xmath11 . clearly , in order for the spacetime to be semi - classical",
    ", the matter state must be semi - classical with respect to @xmath11 .",
    "because of ultraviolet divergences , the property of semi - classicality is scale - dependent . on sufficiently small",
    "length scales the passive fluctuations become arbitrarily large .",
    "operator expectations as in eq .",
    "( [ z ] ) require regularization ; for example , if @xmath28 , it involves products of fields at the same point in spacetime .",
    "we assume a regulator such as point - splitting or smearing of the fields , controlled by a length scale @xmath29 .",
    "short - distance contributions to operator averages are then of order @xmath30 to the appropriate power , leading , e.g. , to fluctuations @xmath31 ( no summation over indices ) . to investigate the effects of these fluctuations , we take @xmath29 to be some characteristic length scale associated with the spacetime or relevant experimental probes , such as test particles .",
    "minkowski spacetime is type a on length scales @xmath32 ( where @xmath14 is the planck length ) , even though @xmath33 , so that @xmath34 for any @xmath29 .",
    "this is because the effect of these fluctuations on the metric @xmath35 is suppressed by @xmath14 , as can be seen from the einstein equations : @xmath36 .",
    "since @xmath37 is constructed of objects with two derivatives of @xmath35 , we see that deviations of @xmath35 from flat space on length scales @xmath29 are of order @xmath38 .",
    "borgman and ford have studied the effect of vacuum energy fluctuations on null geodesics in minkowski space , and found them to be undetectable @xcite .    now consider a device whose spacetime is nontrivial  i.e. , not flat space .",
    "if we take @xmath29 to be some characteristic length scale associated with the device spacetime , the regulated short - distance fluctuations are small compared to the central values of the energy momentum tensor : @xmath39 . in fact , from the einstein equations we expect @xmath40 . in other words , the energy and momentum densities required to warp spacetime on length scale @xmath29 are much larger than @xmath41 .",
    "( as mentioned , in the wormholes studied by morris and thorne in ref .",
    "@xcite , for a throat size of order meters the required energy - momentum densities are of order @xmath15 , provided perhaps by a cosmic string or similar object . )",
    "then , the question of whether the spacetime is semi - classical depends not on the short - distance singularities in the operator products , but rather on whether the wavefunction of @xmath19 is highly peaked about its central value on length scales of @xmath29 or larger . _ the classicality of the spacetime is determined by the classicality of the energy - momentum tensor in the matter state @xmath19 . _    as an example , consider the casimir vacuum @xmath42 , which describes the interior of a cavity of size @xmath12 .",
    "the nec is violated in the casimir state , which has negative ( renormalized ) energy density : @xmath43 . however , since the fluctuations @xmath44 are of order @xmath45 , they are larger than the central value even if we choose the largest possible length scale @xmath46 ; the casimir state never leads to a semi - classical energy - momentum tensor .",
    "further , the casimir state is problematic for construction of an interesting device , since the curvatures induced are only of order @xmath47 .",
    "spacetime within the cavity deviates from flat space only very slightly , and in an intrinsically fuzzy ( highly fluctuating ) manner .",
    "in this section we show that semi - classicality with respect to @xmath48 implies semi - classicality with respect to the fields @xmath25 and their conjugate momenta @xmath26 .",
    "hence the wavefunction is localized in phase space , and the quantum evolution is closely approximated by the classical evolution .",
    "the proof proceeds in two steps .",
    "first , we note that at least two components of @xmath11 do not commute with each other .",
    "then , we derive a relation between the uncertainties in two such non - commuting operators and arbitrary functions of them . in the case of interest",
    ", the original pair is two non - commuting components of @xmath11 and the functions map these operators into @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the relation shows that small uncertainties in @xmath10 imply small uncertainties in the phase space variables .",
    "first , using the translation operator , it is easy to see that @xmath49 $ ] is related to @xmath50 by a unitary transformation . therefore , if for some @xmath51 , @xmath52 for all @xmath53 , then @xmath54 identically .",
    "however , if that were the case we would have , in particular , @xmath55=0 $ ] for all @xmath51 and @xmath53 . integrating over @xmath53 , we find that @xmath56 does not depend on time , which is possible only if @xmath57 .",
    "thus , in any non - trivial model , for any @xmath51 there always exists an @xmath53 for which @xmath58 .",
    "in fact , @xmath59 has support only for @xmath51 near @xmath53 , since it is proportional to the delta function @xmath60 or its spatial derivatives ; this follows from the canonical commutation relation @xmath61 = i \\delta ( x - x')$ ] .",
    "thus , there are at least two non - commuting components of the energy - momentum tensor .    next ,",
    "suppose we have a pair of non - commuting operators @xmath62 and @xmath63 , and consider a new operator which is an arbitrary function of them , @xmath64 .",
    "the only limitation imposed on the function @xmath65 is that it can be expanded in a power series of its arguments .",
    "( note that if @xmath62 and @xmath63 commute we can not necessarily express an arbitrary @xmath66 as a local function of them .",
    "for example , let @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 . ) it should be clear that if both @xmath62 and @xmath63 are semi - classical , than @xmath66 is semi - classical too .",
    "indeed , let us expand the operator @xmath66 around its classical value @xmath70 : @xmath71 + { { \\cal o}}(\\delta^3),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 is of order @xmath73 or @xmath74 .",
    "the fluctuation @xmath75 then is @xmath76 for semi - classical @xmath62 and @xmath63 , the third term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ delta.f ] ) is as small as the first two terms .",
    "thus @xmath66 is semi - classical if @xmath62 and @xmath63 are .",
    "if there is another operator @xmath77 , we also expand it around its classical value @xmath78 and find the commutator @xmath79=(\\bar{{{\\cal f}}}_{\\bar{a}}\\bar{{{\\cal g}}}_{\\bar{b } } -\\bar{{{\\cal f}}}_{\\bar{b}}\\bar{{{\\cal g}}}_{\\bar{a}})[a , b ] + { { \\cal o}}(\\delta^3).\\label{jacobian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] alternatively , in the semi - classical limit the commutator @xmath80 $ ] turns into the poisson bracket @xmath81 .",
    "since the brackets @xmath82 and @xmath83 are related via the jacobian @xmath84 , we arrive at eq .",
    "( [ jacobian ] ) again .",
    "fluctuations of two semi - classical operators @xmath62 and @xmath63 satisfy the relation @xmath85 \\rangle$ ] . since @xmath66 and @xmath86 are semi - classical too , writing the similar relation for them and combining the result with eq .",
    "( [ jacobian ] ) , we arrive at @xmath87     and @xmath88 spaces , up to possible degeneracy.,width=321 ]    to complete our proof , we identify the operators @xmath89 with two non - commuting components of @xmath10 , and the operators @xmath90 with @xmath91 .",
    "a state which has semi - classical energy - momentum tensor then must be localized in phase space , and therefore evolve according to the classical equations of motion . note that if either of the commutators in eq .",
    "( [ jacobian ] ) vanish , the jacobian @xmath92 would be either zero or divergent , and localization in @xmath93 space would not imply localization in @xmath88 space , or vice versa .",
    "it is possible that degeneracies ( either discrete or continuous ) lead to multiple small regions in the @xmath88 space which are mapped onto the same small region of the @xmath93 space ( see fig .",
    "( [ figure ] ) ) .",
    "in other words , there may be inequivalent configurations in phase space with the same energy - momentum tensor .",
    "in such a case , the preceding equations should be modified by including the sums ( or integrals , in the continuous case ) over these regions .",
    "for example , if two states @xmath94 and @xmath95 with distinct values of @xmath96 or @xmath97 lead to the same @xmath98 , we can obtain a semi - classical spacetime from a superposition of the two . nevertheless , _",
    "each _ component of the superposition is localized ( behaves semi - classically ) and will separately exhibit an instability .",
    "classical systems which violate the nec are unstable @xcite in a particularly violent way : they can lower their energy by increasing local spatial field gradients .",
    "therefore , the exotic matter used to stabilize a wormhole throat must be quantum mechanical in nature ; in other words , quantum effects must play an important role in its dynamics and time evolution .",
    "however , it is undesirable for a device to have a strongly fluctuating ( non - semi - classical ) spacetime .",
    "such a device would presumably behave unpredictably and might transport its payload to an undesirable time or place .",
    "we have shown that semi - classicality of the spacetime is a strong enough condition to imply phase space localization of the wavefunction of the stabilizing matter .",
    "this means the time evolution of type a devices will be semi - classical and well - approximated by the classical equations of motion .",
    "such devices are unstable in any region where the nec is violated .",
    "wormholes can not be both predictable and stable .",
