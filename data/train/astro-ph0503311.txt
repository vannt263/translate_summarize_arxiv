    "significant progress towards understanding the nature of grbs and their progenitors came with the discovery of grb afterglows in 1997 @xcite .",
    "first observational evidence for the underlying source population was provided by grb 970828 , which showed a bright x - ray afterglow but no optical counterpart down to faint magnitudes @xcite .",
    "this led to the suggestion that the optical light was blocked by cosmic dust in the grb host galaxy , linking the burster to a dusty star - forming region , i.e. , most likely to the explosion of a massive star @xcite .",
    "the discovery of a near - by type ibc supernova ( sn 1998bw ) in the error circle of the x - ray afterglow for grb 980425 @xcite , provided strong support for this idea , and is consistent with our current understanding of type ibc sne and their progenitors ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    from the observational site ,",
    "the supernova picture is further supported by the fact that all grb hosts are star - forming , and in some cases even star - bursting galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "evidence for host extinction by cosmic dust in grb afterglows and the discovery of an ensemble of optically dark bursts ( for a recent discussion , see @xcite ) also is consistent with the picture that grb progenitors are young , massive stars .",
    "furthermore , for several grb afterglows x - ray lines may hint at a period of nucleosynthesis preceding or accompanying the burst @xcite .",
    "the positions of the afterglows with respect to their hosts also favors a relation to young , massive stars to grbs @xcite .    as a natural consequence of a physical relation between the explosion of massive stars and grbs supernova light",
    "should contribute to the afterglow flux , and even dominate under favorable conditions .",
    "the most convincing example is grb 030329 @xcite at @xmath1=0.1685 @xcite with spectral confirmation of supernova light in its afterglow @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic evidence for sn light in a grb afterglow was later also reported for grb 021211 @xcite , grb 031203 @xcite and most recently for xrf 020903 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to direct spectroscopic evidence , several cases of _ photometric indication of extra light in grb afterglows have been reported , starting with the pioneering work on grb 980326 @xcite .",
    "inspired by this finding , the discovery of extra light in archived data of the afterglow of grb 970228 @xcite made it clear that a search for late - time bumps in optical afterglow light curves provides a powerful tool to constrain or even reveal the nature of the underlying sources . since then",
    "various groups successfully fit sn 1998bw templates to explain these late - time bumps ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the most convincing case being that of grb 011121 @xcite . _",
    "the goal of our study is to search for supernova bumps in grb afterglow light curves using a systematic approach , allowing us to draw statistically founded conclusions on the physical properties of this new class of grb - sne in particular and on the grb progenitors in general .",
    "we collected from the literature all available photometric data on grb afterglows ( including our own data ) , checked them for photometric consistency , and re - analyzed the data in a consistent manner . here",
    "we report on the status of our study for all bursts that occurred by the end of 2003 , supplementing and expanding our previous results ( @xcite , in the following paper i ) .",
    "we model the light curve of the optical transient ( ot ) following a grb as a composite of afterglow ( ag ) light , supernova ( sn ) light , and constant light from the underlying host galaxy . the flux density , @xmath2 , at a frequency @xmath3",
    "is then given by @xmath4 here , the parameter @xmath5 describes the observed brightness ratio ( in the host frame , i.e. , including the cosmological @xmath6-correction ) between the grb - supernova , and the sn template ( sn 1998bw ) in the considered photometric band ( in the observer frame ) .",
    "we allowed @xmath5 to be different in every photometric band , but within a band independent of frequency .",
    "the parameter @xmath7 is a stretch factor with respect to the used template .",
    "we have also explored the consequences of a shift in time between the onset of the burst and the onset of the supernova explosion , as implied by some theoretical models @xcite .",
    "then , in eq .",
    "( [ ot ] ) @xmath8 was replaced by @xmath9 . here , @xmath10 refers to grb 980425/sn 1998bw @xcite . if @xmath11 the sn preceded the onset of the grb .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , we describe the afterglow light curve by a broken power - law , @xmath12^{-1/n}\\ , , \\label{ag}\\ ] ] with const=@xmath13 here @xmath14 is the time after the burst ( in the observer frame ) , @xmath15 is the pre - break decay slope of the afterglow light curve , @xmath16 is the post - break decay slope , and @xmath17 is the break time .",
    "the parameter @xmath18 characterizes the sharpness of the break ; a larger @xmath18 implies a sharper break . if no break is seen in the data then @xmath19 and eq .",
    "( [ ag ] ) simplifies correspondingly .",
    "the results of this numerical procedure were compared with corresponding results published by others @xcite , and we found close agreement .",
    "we used this procedure to _ predict the color evolution of grb 030329/sn 2002dh @xcite , and obtained a very good numerical fit for the light curves of grb - sn 011121 @xcite .",
    "the limitations of the procedure are given by the chosen photometric band in combination with the redshift of the burster .",
    "once we can no longer interpolate in between the @xmath0 bands , but have to extrapolate into the uv domain ( cf .",

    "we calculated the galactic visual extinction according to @xmath21 = 3.1 @xmath20 , whereas the extinction in @xmath22 and @xmath23 were obtained via @xcite , and in @xmath24 and @xmath25 by means of the numerical functions compiled in @xcite .",

    "this , together with the spectral confirmation of sn light in the afterglows of grb 021211 , 030329 , and 031203 further supports the view that in fact @xmath39 long - duration grbs show sn bumps in their late - time optical afterglows .",
    "given the fact that a strong late - time bump was also found for xrf 030723 @xcite and a less strong bump for xrf 020903 ( but with spectroscopic confirmation of underlying sn light @xcite ) might indicate that this conclusion holds also for x - ray flashes ( even though the finding of xrf - sne might be more difficult ; see @xcite )",
