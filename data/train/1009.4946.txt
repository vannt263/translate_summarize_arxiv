    "when the xps measurements are taken at @xmath18 = 45@xmath19 , most of the signal intensity comes from layers 1 and 2 . as @xmath18 increases to 75@xmath19 , the contribution of photoelectrons excited in layer 3 increases significantly ; therefore the hf 4f peak will shift to higher energy since layer 3 has a lower hf concentration than layer 2 .",
    "however , the film composition calculated from the xps peak intensities will not change since layer 3 has the average composition of layer 1 and 2 .",
    "the layered structure shown in fig . [ structure ] agrees with the hrtem image shown in fig .",

    "_ @xcite observed interference peaks in the horizontal cuts of their two - dimensional gisaxs intensity distribution , which correspond to a hf concentration fluctuation in the plane of the film with @xmath23-values of 5 nm in the 4 nm ( hfo@xmath0)@xmath5(sio@xmath0)@xmath6 films ( @xmath37 = 0.4 ) after @xmath38 annealing .",
    "this observation was confirmed by their plan - view tem image , which showed interconnected hf - rich and si - rich regions .",
    "however , these authors did not try to interpret vertical cuts of their gisaxs data but still concluded that their observations were inconsistent with sdsd .",
    "in contrast , the tem images reported here always show a layered structure for post - annealed films of thickness @xmath128 nm , which is consistent with sdsd .",
    "a crucial observation revealed from the present study is the effect of restricted dimensionality on spinodal decomposition of hfo@xmath0-sio@xmath0 systems . in effect , when the region available for phase separation is a 2-dimensional film in the @xmath39 plane with a restricted thickness @xmath40 in the @xmath41 direction , the @xmath40 parameter controls the ensuing structure .",
    "this can be understood by looking at the free - energy of the system which consists of species @xmath42 with crystal structures @xmath43 .",
    "the free energy consists of a configurational energy @xmath44 based on the possible crystal structures @xmath45 and an entropy component @xmath46 .",
    "thus the total free energy can be written as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the temperature .",
    "the free energy analysis gives the equilibrium state and becomes strictly valid if the spinodal structures are the ground state of the system .",
    "if such structures result from a kinetic process ( i.e. , if they are metastable structures ) , the free energies must be replaced by energies corresponding to quasi - stationary states .",
    "however , the present analysis is adequate to understand the observed effects .    in a thick film containing two species ( e.g. , sio@xmath0 and hfo@xmath0 ) ,",
    "the energetically favourable total nanostructure is made up of the bulk crystal structures which we denote by @xmath49 and @xmath50 . here ,",
    "if species 1 is hfo@xmath0 , then @xmath49 ( i.e. , the bulk hfo@xmath0 structure of large grains ) is the monoclinic structure.@xcite if the second material is si the bulk structure is cubic , while in the case of sio@xmath0 we may take it to be the crystalobite structure or some modification thereof , as needed for surface films.@xcite we need to consider the situation where both si atoms and hf atoms may compete for bonding with o atoms .",
    "if thin films are formed on a substrate , then we have to deal with possible spinodals based on the bulk structures and the crystal structures manifested by vanishingly thin films .",
    "let us denote the crystal structures found in vanishingly thin films by @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the thinnest hfo@xmath0 films tend to form orthorhombic structures,@xcite while the structure of very thin sio@xmath0 layers on si substrates tend to be quasi - crystalline or amorphous modifications of the crystalobite structures.@xcite    when the thickness @xmath40 of the film is extremely small , e.g. , less than a nanometer , bonds involving only a single binary species are possible in the @xmath39 plane but the @xmath41 direction thickness @xmath40 would only allow a monolayer or two of a single ( binary ) species such as hfo@xmath0 .",
    "our experiments show the formation of a hf - rich surface layer whose structure can be interpreted starting from an orthorhombic disposition of the hf - o bonds but taking account of their termination at the surface . when the thickness @xmath40 of the deposited layer is increased , inner layers face competition , forcing them towards the bulk crystal structure @xmath49 , which in this case is monoclinic . a similar competitive process involving the crystal structures of species 2",
    ", i.e. , sio@xmath0 , also occurs .",
    "bonds may also be formed between the common element ( oxygen ) with hf or si . however , there is not enough volume in a thin film to achieve the full configurational entropy of each species by full phase separation .",
    "thus a compromise is achieved by sdsd .",
    "this compromise itself depends on the film thickness , partly because the limiting structures @xmath53 and @xmath54 are different in each species .",
    "other factors which may come into play are effects associated with crystal growth kinetics ( i.e. , non - equilibrium effects ) . however , such effects are , in our view , unimportant in this problem as the effects can be explained via a model which assumes local thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the validity of the above picture is evident on a qualitative basis .",
    "a more detailed quantitative evaluation is not considered here since simulation of sio@xmath0/hfo@xmath0 structures using first principles density functional methods@xcite or tight - binding methods@xcite is beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "surface - directed spinodal decomposition in hf silicate films during the film growth and annealing process can be envisioned from the above observations . in the as - grown film",
    ", there is always a very thin layer of sio@xmath0 ( @xmath24monolayer of sio@xmath0 ) at the film surface . beneath this layer",
    "is a hf - rich layer . when the film thickness is @xmath125 nm , hf atoms diffuse towards the film surface as the film thickness increases , resulting in a hf - rich layer closer to the film surface and a si - rich layer closer to the substrate .",
    "as the film thickness increases to values @xmath175 nm , some of the hf atoms in the hf - rich layer closer to the film surface diffuse towards the substrate .",
    "if the thickness is 1.5@xmath23 , the film separates into three layers after rta : a si - rich layer sandwiched between two hf - rich layers .",
    "if the film thickness is @xmath242@xmath23 , the film has a four - layer structure starting from the substrate surface : si - rich , hf - rich , si - rich and hf - rich .",
    "as the thickness increases to @xmath172@xmath23 , the film loses its layered structure in the center of the film . after a longer time anneal , the layered structure coarsens and the composition wave grows .",
    "crystallization of hfo@xmath0 was observed in a 12 nm film after 600 s anneal at @xmath4 and in a 20 nm as - grown film , indicating that nucleation and growth of hfo@xmath0 follows spinodal decomposition during the annealing or film deposition process .    the configurations in as - grown and annealed ( hfo@xmath0)@xmath1(sio@xmath0)@xmath2 films are qualitatively in agreement with the theory of sdsd , i.e. , composition waves were observed normal to the film surface .",
    "the observation that the composition of the film layer in contact with the substrate can be affected by film thickness has never been predicted by any sdsd simulation .",
    "presumably , theoretical studies of sdsd could be modified to accommodate these experimental results . at this time",
    ", it is difficult to study sdsd in ( hfo@xmath0)@xmath1(sio@xmath0)@xmath2 films to determine whether the composition wave obeys the growth law , i.e. , @xmath55 t@xmath56,@xcite because : ( i ) tem is a qualitative technique concerning atomic composition ; ( ii ) sd in oxide systems is not easily controlled since the process occurs during the film deposition process ; ( iii ) an alternative kinetic process , viz .",
    ", nucleation and growth , can impede sd during the late stages of phase separation ; and ( iv ) any o@xmath0 impurity in the annealing n@xmath0 ambient may also diffuse through the film and oxidize the substrate . although gisaxs is a powerful tool to characterize composition fluctuations in thin films,@xcite caution has to be taken when using this technique to study sdsd in hf silicate films since hfo@xmath0 crystallizes at a relatively low temperature in thick films , as seen in the 20 nm as - grown film .",
    "while sdsd in the ( hfo@xmath0)@xmath1(sio@xmath0)@xmath2 thin films has been confirmed , the composition range for which ( hfo@xmath0)@xmath5(sio@xmath0)@xmath6 films experience sd and the resultant compositions of the phase - separated domains are still open questions .    the present observation of sdsd in ( hfo@xmath0)@xmath5(sio@xmath0)@xmath6 films may present significant device performance and reliability challenges for high-@xmath9 gate dielectric applications of pseudobinary alloy systems such as zro@xmath0-sio@xmath0 , y@xmath0o@xmath7-sio@xmath0 , la@xmath0o@xmath7-sio@xmath0 , etc.,@xcite and have effects on thin film applications for any two - component system whose phase diagram shows a miscibility gap . the ald growth mechanism for two - component films could also be influenced by sdsd if the film surface is preferentially attracted to one of the two components ."
