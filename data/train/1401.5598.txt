    "although the nature of the normal state of the cuprates remains enigmatic , their superconducting state is generally believed to be quite conventional @xcite .",
    "in fact , superconductivity of the cuprates is a consequence of the global @xmath1 symmetry breaking caused by cooper - pair condensation , i.e. by the same mechanism as in the conventional low-@xmath2 superconductors .",
    "the cooper pairs are formed by electrons in a single cuo@xmath3 plane and their spin is @xmath4 .",
    "a minor modification is that the orbital wave - function of the cooper pairs transforms as the so - called @xmath5-wave under the point group of the cuo@xmath3 plane .",
    "the major open question of the cuprate physics is what forms the pairing glue which holds the electrons in the cooper pairs together , or even whether such a pairing glue is present at all @xcite .",
    "if we introduce the nambu spinors @xmath6 , all single - particle properties of the cuprates should be described by the nambu - gorkov green s function @xmath7 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "note that we work in the imaginary - time formalism and that @xmath8 is a 2@xmath92 matrix @xmath10 which is determined by two functions : by the diagonal green s function ( normal propagator ) @xmath11 , as well as by the off - diagonal green s function ( anomalous propagator ) @xmath12 .",
    "we emphasize that the green s function @xmath13 may be introduced even if the landau - bcs fermi liquid theory does not apply to the cuprates .",
    "the spectral representation of the green s function is defined as : @xmath14 where we have introduced the spectral function of the normal propagator @xmath15 , as well as the spectral function of the anomalous propagator @xmath16 . in the lehmann representation , these functions read as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the temperature . throughout this paper",
    "we set @xmath19 and @xmath20 .    in singlet superconductors with even parity",
    "we expect that @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "for the same reason , we expect that @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "when combined with the property @xmath25 which follows from hermiticity , we finally find that the anomalous spectral function is odd , @xmath26 .",
    "note that the normal spectral function @xmath27 is real and positive , therefore allowing for a probabilistic interpretation .",
    "it is this function which is measured in the angle - resolved photoemission experiments ( arpes ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , the integral @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the normalisation volume , is directly accessible in the tunneling experiments @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the function @xmath30 is in general complex and therefore it does not have an obvious probabilistic interpretation .",
    "moreover , @xmath30 depends on the phase of the condensate . at the present time there",
    "seem to be no established experimental procedures which would determine the function @xmath31 .",
    "thus only one of the two functions @xmath27 and @xmath30 , which are needed to characterize the single - particle properties of a superconductor , is currently experimentally accessible . in section  [ sec_pair_breaking ] we show that , even in conventional superconductors where the electrons interact via exchange of bosonic interactions , this lack of information may lead to severe errors in identifying the pairing glue by arpes .",
    "we demonstrate that both , the pairing and the pair - breaking interactions , modify the normal spectral function @xmath27 in essentially the same way , making them indistinguishable in a naive @xmath27-based experiment .",
    "a similar observation has been made very recently in the context of the cuprates @xcite : the magnitude of the dispersion kink at 70  mev in la@xmath32sr@xmath33cuo@xmath34 has been found to decrease by only 30% between the superconducting sample with @xmath35 and @xmath3632  k and a non - superconducting overdoped sample with @xmath37 and @xmath360  k. from here the authors conclude that these dispersion kinks can not be caused by the pairing glue of superconductivity .    within the eliashberg theory ,",
    "the two functions @xmath27 and @xmath30 are encoded in two functions @xmath38 and @xmath39 . in section  [ sec_dos ]",
    "we show that , under certain simplifying assumptions which happen to be satisfied in the conventional superconductors , the function @xmath39 which characterizes the pairing can be quite unexpectedly extracted from the measurement of only @xmath27 . in section  [ sec_dos ] we also describe some recent attempts to apply this type of approach to the cuprate superconductors .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec_anomalous ] we go beyond the @xmath40-based spectroscopic techniques and we suggest how , at least in principle , the anomalous spectral function @xmath30 can be determined directly from the current - current correlation function of the josephson junctions .",
    "the eliashberg theory @xcite results from a combination of the dyson equation @xmath41^{-1 } $ ] with a self - consistent born approximation for the @xmath42 self - energy matrix @xmath43 . in the electron - phonon case",
    ", this is virtually exact due to the migdal `` theorem '' . for",
    "the sake of simplicity , let us assume that the system under study is isotropic and particle - hole symmetric .",
    "then we can make the following ansatz for the self - energy of an @xmath44-wave pairing state : @xmath45 , where the wave - function renormalisation @xmath46 and the gap function @xmath47 are real functions ( only ) of frequency , @xmath48 is a @xmath42 unit matrix , and @xmath49 with @xmath50 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the diagonal and off - diagonal components of the resulting green s function in this simple case read as @xmath51    in order to illustrate the difference between the pairing and pair - breaking modes , let us consider the following simple model of interacting electrons and bosons : @xmath52 .",

    "the second term describes the coupling of strength @xmath57 between the electron current density @xmath58 and a vector mode with the propagator @xmath59 and the fourier transform @xmath60 . in the nambu representation",
    "we can write @xmath61 the presence of different @xmath62-matrices in @xmath63 and @xmath64 is caused by the different behaviour of charge and current under time reversal . in the self - consistent born approximation , the @xmath42 self - energy matrix corresponding to @xmath65 is given by @xmath66 for the sake of simplicity , in what follows let us replace the factor @xmath67 by its value for forward scattering , i.e. by 1 .",
    "performing furthermore the radial integrations in the usual way by introducing the electronic density of states in the normal state @xmath68 , the eliashberg equations reduce to the standard form    [ eq : impure_eliashberg ] @xmath69 @xmath70    where @xmath71 are dimensionless coupling functions for the two modes @xmath72 and @xmath73 is a fermi - surface average of @xmath74 .",
    "note that both modes enter equation  ( [ eq : impure_eliashberg_a ] ) for the wave - function renormalisation in a symmetric way .",
    "this is not the case , however , for equation  ( [ eq : impure_eliashberg_b ] ) for the gap function , since @xmath75 and @xmath76 , clearly distinguishing the pairing scalar mode from the pair - breaking vector mode .",
    "this difference is caused by the difference in @xmath62-matrices , i.e. by the different behaviour of charge and current under time reversal .",
    "physically , the result @xmath76 is a consequence of the repulsive force between antiparallel currents carried by the electrons forming a cooper pair .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the eliashberg equations  ( [ eq : impure_eliashberg ] ) can be generalized to take into account also finite impurity scattering treated within the self - consistent born approximation , if we include an additional scattering mode @xmath77 with an elastic coupling function @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "also a simplified version of pair - breaking elastic scattering on the magnetic impurities can be described by the same formalism by including yet another scattering mode @xmath80 with the coupling function @xmath81 and @xmath82 .    in figure  [ fig_2modes ]",
    "we plot the wave - function renormalisation and the gap function , after analytical continuation to the real axis by means of the pad approximation @xcite , for the two - mode model  ( [ eq : model ] ) . we have considered coupling to debye - type modes with coupling strengths @xmath83 and linear dispersions @xmath84 , which leads to the coupling functions @xmath85 $ ] with dimensionless coupling constants @xmath86 and characteristic frequencies @xmath87 .",
    "the crucial observation to be made in figure  [ fig_2modes ] is that the wave - function renormalisation @xmath88 does not distinguish between pairing and pair - breaking modes : for instance , at both characteristic frequencies @xmath89 and @xmath90 , the imaginary part @xmath91 exhibits local maxima .",
    "whether we are dealing with a pairing or a pair - breaking mode is visible only in the gap function @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath92 the imaginary part @xmath93 exhibits a local minimum close to the pair - breaking scale @xmath90 , while close to the pairing scale @xmath89 it exhibits a maximum .",
    "similarly , when we lower the energy @xmath94 below @xmath89 , the pairing energy @xmath95 increases , while exactly opposite behaviour is observed in the vicinity of @xmath90 .    the same dichotomy is observed also in the language of spectral functions : the normal spectral function @xmath27 does not distinguish the pairing from the pair - breaking modes , since it exhibits maxima in the vicinity of both , @xmath89 and @xmath90 . on the contrary , the anomalous spectral function @xmath30 exhibits for @xmath96 local maxima in the vicinity of the pair - breaking energy @xmath90 , whereas local minima are observed close to the pairing energy @xmath89",
    ".    note that in the gauge which we have chosen to work in , @xmath30 is real but not positive even if we restrict ourselves to @xmath96 .",
    "the necessity of a sign change of @xmath30 follows from the following exact sum rule which we prove in appendix  [ sec_appendix_a ] : @xmath97 it is worth pointing out that if the coulomb pseudopotential @xmath98 is included in equations  ( [ eq : impure_eliashberg ] ) then the sum rule  ( [ eq : sum_rule ] ) does not hold any more , but we have checked that the function @xmath30 still exhibits both , a sign change and a feature close to the energy of the pairing glue .",
    "it is well known that the tunneling experiments gave the historically first direct access to the gap function @xmath0 of the conventional superconductors @xcite .",
    "it is rarely stressed , however , that the very possibility to interpret the tunneling density of states @xmath99 solely in terms of @xmath0 is somewhat surprising .",
    "in fact , @xmath99 per spin is given by @xmath100 where in the approximate equality we have assumed that the system is effectively isotropic , and that the density of states in the normal state does not vary appreciably on the energy scale of the superconducting gap . the surprise has to do with the fact that @xmath101 is given by equation  ( [ eq : green_eliashberg ] ) , that is by two functions @xmath38 and @xmath39 in the general case .",
    "but it should not be possible to determine _ two _ functions from a measurement of a _ single _ function @xmath99 !",
    "the solution to this paradox is that , if @xmath102 and @xmath39 do not depend on @xmath103 , the integration over @xmath104 can be performed and it leads to the result ( assuming that the branch cut of the square root is set along the negative real axis ) @xmath105 which does not depend on @xmath88 any more . therefore  ( [ eq : dos_isotropic ] ) can be used as a tool for measuring the gap function @xmath0 .",
    "it should be pointed out that the inversion of the formula  ( [ eq : dos_isotropic ] ) is not completely trivial , since @xmath106 is a complex function , but thanks to the analytic properties of @xmath0 it can be performed @xcite .    in figure  [ fig_dos ]",
    "we plot the tunneling density of states @xmath99 for the two - mode model  ( [ eq : model ] ) .",
    "we have introduced the spectral gap @xmath107 as a solution to the equation @xmath108 and we find @xmath109 .",
    "note that @xmath99 exhibits local increase at the pair - breaking scale @xmath110 and a decrease at the pairing scale @xmath111 .     and anomalous density of states @xmath112 for the two - mode model  ( [ eq : model ] ) .",
    "the parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig_2modes ] .",
    "note the structure close to the energy scales @xmath89 and @xmath90 ( which are shown by the dotted lines).,width=302 ]      the pairing state within a cuo@xmath3 plane is known to be anisotropic @xcite , therefore the results for the density of states derived in section  [ sec_dos1 ] obviously do not apply to the cuprates . in order to account for their in - plane anisotropy , let us introduce the curvilinear coordinates @xmath113 , where @xmath114 varies along the fermi line and @xmath115 varies along the normal to the fermi line .",
    "let us further denote the length of the fermi line as @xmath116 and instead of @xmath114 define the angular variable @xmath117 along the fermi line by @xmath118 .",
    "let us also replace the coordinate @xmath115 by the non - interacting energy @xmath104 , making use of the relation @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the fermi velocity at angle @xmath117 .    the functions @xmath38 and @xmath39 entering the definition of the green s function  ( [ eq : green_eliashberg ] ) depend in general on three variables @xmath121 .",
    "if we now assume , in analogy with conventional superconductors , that their dependence on @xmath104 can be neglected , then the @xmath104-integration in equation  ( [ eq : dos_def ] ) can be performed and we arrive at the expression for the two - dimensional density of states per spin @xmath122 where we have defined the angle - resolved ( tomographic ) density of states @xmath123    usually it is assumed that scanning tunneling spectrocopy from the @xmath124-axis direction gives us direct access to the tunneling density of states @xmath99 in the cuprates @xcite",
    ". however , even if we assume that equations  ( [ eq : dos_anisotropic],[eq : dos_tomographic ] ) do apply , their direct inversion with the goal of determining @xmath125 is not possible , due to the @xmath117-dependence of the gap function .",
    "the best one can do is to fit the data for @xmath99 to a postulated microscopic model and to extract the relevant parameters in this way .",
    "a recent example of such a procedure can be found in @xcite , where the tunneling data on bi2223 have been fit to a phenomenological model with spin - fluctuation induced pairing .",
    "it should be pointed out , however , that no less than 13 parameters were needed in the fits . clearly , a less biased technique for determination of @xmath125 is needed .",
    "very recently , it has been realized @xcite that the tomographic density of states can be determined from the arpes data by taking their integral according to the definition  ( [ eq : dos_tomographic ] ) .",
    "very promising results for @xmath126 have been found for angles @xmath117 lying close to the nodal direction . since the authors were interested only in the simplest questions regarding the interplay between the pair - breaking rate @xmath127 and the gap magnitude @xmath128 , the measured tomographic density of states was fitted to the dynes formula .",
    "however , by applying the powerful inversion technology @xcite to the data for @xmath126 at fixed angle @xmath117 , it should be possible to obtain the full complex function @xmath129 without making any additional assumptions about its shape .",
    "this might open an unbiased way to the identification of the pairing glue in the cuprates .",
    "let us assume again that the functions @xmath130 and @xmath125 depend only on @xmath117 and @xmath94 , but not on @xmath104 .",

    "such plots are called momentum distribution functions and their simple shape can be taken as an a posteriori evidence for independence of @xmath130 on @xmath104 @xcite . moreover ,",
    "if the bare dispersion @xmath104 is known , then the function @xmath134 can be easily determined by fitting the momentum distribution functions to a lorentzian .",
    "let us generalize the predictions of equation  ( [ eq : momentum_distrib ] ) for the momentum distribution function to the superconducting state . to illustrate the point ,",

    "two additional fitting parameters had to be used : one for the overall intensity , and another one for background subtraction .",
    "the bare dispersion @xmath104 was taken from a tight - binding model .",
    "the momentum distribution curves for the two - mode model  ( [ eq : model ] ) for several values of @xmath94 are shown in figure  [ fig_mdc ] .",

    "the results for the anomalous self - energy necessarily become quite noisy , as in fact found also in @xcite .",
    "therefore this technique is potentially useful in cases where the characteristic energy of the pairing glue is comparable to the energy gap .",
    "all of the techniques for determination of the gap function @xmath39 described in section  [ sec_dos ] were based on the measurement of the diagonal spectral function @xmath40 .",
    "the crucial feature which had to be assumed was that the functions @xmath145 and @xmath146 do not depend on @xmath104 . while this assumption is well established in the context of low - temperature superconductors , it is far from obvious that it applies to the cuprates as well . on one hand ,",
    "the simplicity of the momentum distribution curves as opposed to the complicated energy distribution curves in arpes can be taken as indirect evidence for such weak @xmath104-dependence @xcite .",
    "but on the other hand , since the cuprates are doped mott insulators , one should expect large particle - hole asymmetry , and therefore also strong @xmath104-dependence , as in fact observed in tunneling experiments @xcite .",
    "also the more standard concept of spin - fluctuation mediated superconductivity naturally leads to a strong @xmath104-dependence , because only at the hot spots the scattering is equally strong for electron states inside and outside the fermi sea .",
    "away from the hot spots , scattering either inside or outside the fermi sea should dominate , depending on the angle @xmath117 .    an obvious recipe to determine the _ two functions _ @xmath147 and @xmath38 is to measure the _ two spectral functions _ characterizing a superconductor , namely @xmath40 and @xmath30 .",
    "we are thus led to the search for a suitable spectroscopic technique for the anomalous spectral function @xmath30 .",
    "a natural candidate is the josephson effect , where the cooper pairs enter or leave a given superconductor .",
    "however , the josephson current is determined by an integral of @xmath30 , providing just one number and not a function of a continuous parameter , needed for a spectroscopic measurement .",
    "we are therefore led to the study of the frequency spectrum of temporal fluctuations of the current @xmath148 traversing the josephson junction at zero bias @xmath149 or , making use of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xmath150\\chi^{\\prime\\prime}(\\omega)$ ] , of the retarded current - current correlation function @xmath151\\rangle \\theta(t ) .",

    "as expected , the pairing and pair - breaking scales are discriminated by @xmath167 in the same way as by @xmath112 .",
    "let us conclude by suggesting a two - step procedure for quantitative determination of the pairing glue from the measured function @xmath167 .",

    ", we should invert  ( [ eq : dos_anomalous ] ) to obtain the complex function @xmath0",
    ". it should be possible to perform this task by modifying the approach of @xcite .",
    "to summarize , we have presented a short review of the techniques used to extract information on the pairing glue in superconductors , having in mind their applicability to the cuprates .",
    "all currently available experimental techniques exploit data on the normal spectral function @xmath27 .",
    "the most promising approaches of this type have been described in sections  [ sec_dos2 ] and [ sec_dos3 ] .",
    "since all @xmath27-based techniques need to postulate that the normal and anomalous self - energies do not depend on @xmath104 and since this assumption may not hold in the cuprates , in section  [ sec_anomalous ] we have suggested a novel technique for a direct measurement of the anomalous spectral function @xmath30 , which makes use of the correlation function @xmath183 of currents in a josephson junction involving the studied superconductor .",
    "this enables in principle a much more direct determination of the pairing glue in a superconductor , when compared to the conventional @xmath40-based techniques .    as a proof of concept ,",
    "we have analyzed @xmath183 in junctions between conventional isotropic superconductors in the simplest case of featureless tunneling .",
    "obviously , in order to be applicable to the cuprates , some degree of directionality of tunneling will need to be allowed for , since in a @xmath5-wave superconductor the anomalous density of states @xmath112 vanishes .",
    "moreover , especially in junctions involving underdoped cuprates , the effect of phase fluctuations on @xmath183 may have to be included .",
    "the most pressing question , however , is how to measure @xmath183 at the ( presumably ) high typical frequencies of the pairing glue , when the complex conductivity of the junction is likely to be dominated by its capacitance .    quite generally ,",
    "irreducible correlation functions of other observables , such as charge - charge , spin - spin , etc . , involve normal and superconducting contributions resembling  ( [ eq : chi_ns ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , their analysis is much more complicated than in the present case , because of the non - vanishing vertex corrections .",
    "moreover , even in simplest cases the physical correlation functions are given as a geometric series of irreducible correlation functions .",
    "nevertheless , it might be possible to extract @xmath30 also from appropriate combinations of correlation functions which are more readily measurable than @xmath183 .",
    "such approaches definitely deserve further study .",

    "because of the symmetry @xmath184 of the anomalous self - energy @xmath185 , the kramers - kronig relations imply in the limit @xmath186 the scaling @xmath187 since in any dynamic theory without instantaneous interactions @xmath188 , in the limit @xmath186 we therefore have @xmath189 and from equation  ( [ eq : green_eliashberg ] ) it follows that @xmath190",
    ". on the other hand , the spectral representation  ( [ eq : spectral_representation ] ) can be written at @xmath186 as a power series @xmath191 but because @xmath190 , the first three terms @xmath192 have to vanish . since @xmath30 is odd ,",
    "the results for @xmath193 and 2 are trivial . on the other hand ,",

    "the procedure is feasible only if @xmath206 is a _ continuous _ function that _ never crosses zero_. however , the second condition fails only in very special cases , because @xmath206 is a complex - valued function ."
