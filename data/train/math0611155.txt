    "the loop - erased random walk is a process obtained from a random walk by erasing loops in chronological order .",
    "more precisely , given a sequence of points @xmath8 , which we can think of as the first @xmath9 points visited by some random walk , we define the loop - erasure @xmath10 to be the sequence @xmath11 obtained inductively as follows .",
    "first set @xmath12 .",
    "suppose @xmath13 have been defined for some @xmath14 .",
    "if @xmath15 , then @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the last vertex in the sequence @xmath10 . otherwise , define @xmath18 , where @xmath19 .",
    "we denote the number of points in @xmath10 , which in this example is @xmath20 , by @xmath21 .",
    "we call @xmath21 the length of the loop - erased path .",
    "the loop - erased random walk was first studied in 1980 by lawler @xcite , and the model has continued to receive attention in recent years , in part because of connections with uniform spanning trees that were discovered by pemantle @xcite and wilson @xcite . for the loop - erased random walk on @xmath22 with @xmath23 ,",
    "lawler @xcite showed that a positive fraction of the vertices never get erased , so if the random walk is run for time @xmath5 , then the length of the loop - erased path is also of order @xmath5 , and the loop - erased random walk as a process converges to brownian motion . the loop - erased random walk on @xmath24 also converges to brownian motion , as shown by lawler in @xcite , but there is a logarithmic correction to the length of the path .",
    "if the random walk is run for time @xmath5 , the length of the loop - erased walk was shown by lawler @xcite to be of the order @xmath25 .",
    "the loop - erased random walk behaves much differently in dimensions two and three , but there has been recent progress in these lower dimensions .",
    "kenyon @xcite showed that the length of the loop - erased random walk on @xmath26 is of order @xmath27 , while lawler , schramm , and werner @xcite showed that the loop - erased random walk on @xmath26 converges to the schramm - loewner evolution ( sle ) with parameter @xmath28 .",
    "kozma @xcite established the existence of a scaling limit for the loop - erased random walk on @xmath29 , but the form of the limiting process remains unknown . in this paper , we consider the behavior of the loop - erased random walk on large finite graphs .",
    "we will focus especially on the @xmath4-dimensional torus of side length @xmath5 , which we denote by @xmath30 , for @xmath6 .",
    "given a finite connected graph @xmath31 , write @xmath32 if @xmath33 is a vertex of @xmath2 and let @xmath34 denote the number of vertices of @xmath2 . write @xmath35 if the vertices @xmath33 and @xmath36 are connected by an edge . throughout the paper",
    ", we will assume that @xmath2 is vertex transitive .",
    "therefore , every vertex has the same degree , which we denote here by @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath37 be a discrete - time markov chain taking its values in @xmath38 such that @xmath39 that is , at each step the markov chain stays at its current vertex with probability @xmath40 and otherwise moves to a randomly chosen neighboring vertex .",
    "this process is often called the lazy random walk , as opposed to the simple random walk which never stays at its current vertex .",
    "fix a vertex @xmath41 to be the starting point for the random walk , and denote the transition probabilities of the random walk by @xmath42 .",
    "since @xmath2 is vertex transitive , the stationary distribution of the random walk is given by @xmath43 for all @xmath44 .",
    "because the lazy random walk is aperiodic , the distribution of @xmath45 converges to the stationary distribution as @xmath46 .",
    "denote the uniform mixing time of the random walk , that is , the mixing time measured in terms of the separation distance , by @xmath47 it is well - known that on @xmath48 , there exist positive constants @xmath49 and @xmath50 such that for all @xmath5 , @xmath51 ( see , for example , the calculations in chapter 5 of @xcite ) . for the rest of the paper",
    ", we will work with a sequence of vertex - transitive , finite graphs @xmath0 such that @xmath52 we will consider two cases .",
    "* case 1 * : the graphs @xmath0 satisfy the following conditions :    * there is a constant @xmath53 such that @xmath54 * there is a @xmath55 such that @xmath56    * case 2 * : for all @xmath5 , we have @xmath57 .",
    "the conditions for case 1 are precisely the conditions assumed in @xcite by peres and revelle , who used loop - erased random walks to show that the scaling limit of the uniform spanning tree on these graphs as @xmath58 is the brownian continuum random tree of aldous @xcite .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , this family of graphs includes the @xmath4-dimensional torus @xmath59 for @xmath23 , the complete graph on @xmath5 vertices , the hypercubes @xmath60 , and expander graphs .",
    "schweinsberg @xcite showed that the scaling limit of the uniform spanning tree on @xmath61 is also the continuum random tree .",
    "the results in this paper will hold for the four - dimensional torus as well as for the family of graphs studied by peres and revelle , but at times in the proofs the two cases will be treated separately .",
    "our goal is to study how the length of the loop - erased random walk on @xmath2 evolves over time . on @xmath22 for @xmath23",
    ", it is known that the length of the loop - erased random walk grows linearly in time ; see theorem 7.7.2 of @xcite , and see also theorem 7.7.5 of @xcite for a similar result when @xmath62 .",
    "the reason is that the random walk does not make long loops , so loop erasure is a local procedure .",
    "the linear growth then comes from the fact that most points have approximately the same probability of never being erased . for the tori @xmath48 with @xmath6 and for the other graphs satisfying the conditions of case 1",
    ", the random walk also makes long loops .",
    "the long loops occur on a time scale much longer than the mixing time . as a result , when the random walk makes a long loop , the point on the path that the random walk hits is approximately uniformly distributed over all the points in the path .",
    "therefore , when the long loop is erased , the length of the path is multipied by a fraction which is approximately uniformly distributed between @xmath63 and @xmath64 . as on @xmath22 ,",
    "the length of the path grows approximately linearly between the times when these long loops form .    as a result of this intuition ,",
    "jim pitman conjectured that the length of the loop - erased random walk on @xmath2 converges to a process called the rayleigh process as @xmath58 .",
    "the rayleigh process @xmath65 was introduced by evans , pitman , and winter @xcite .",
    "the process grows linearly at unit speed between jumps . at time @xmath3 , jumps occur at rate @xmath66 , and at the times of jumps , the value of the process gets multiplied by a random variable which is uniformly distributed on @xmath67 $ ] .",
    "more formally , the rayleigh process can be constructed from a poisson point process @xmath68 on @xmath69 whose intensity measure is lebesgue measure . given @xmath70 , we can obtain a rayleigh process started from @xmath71 by defining @xmath72 this means that when @xmath73 is a point of this poisson process and @xmath74 , there is a jump at time @xmath3 and @xmath75 ( see figure 1 below ) .",
    "it was shown in proposition 8.1 of @xcite that the stationary distribution for this process is the rayleigh distribution , where we say a random variable @xmath76 has a rayleigh distribution if @xmath77 for all @xmath78 , and that for any starting point @xmath79 , the distribution of @xmath80 converges to the rayleigh distribution as @xmath46 . for more about the rayleigh process , see section 8 of @xcite",
    "it is already known ( see @xcite for case 1 and @xcite for case 2 ) that if @xmath81 and @xmath79 are vertices of @xmath2 chosen uniformly at random , then the distribution of the length of the loop - erased random walk started at @xmath81 and run until it hits @xmath79 , suitably normalized , converges to the rayleigh distribution as @xmath58 .",
    "the theorem below , which was conjectured by pitman , is a dynamical result , which shows that the length of the loop - erased random walk converges to the rayleigh process , in the sense of skorohod convergence for processes whose sample paths are right continuous and have left limits .",
    "when @xmath2 is the complete graph with @xmath5 vertices , this result can be obtained from corollary 8.2 of @xcite .",
    "figure 1 : the rayleigh process    let @xmath82 denote the rayleigh process with @xmath83 . let @xmath0 be a sequence of graphs satisfying the conditions of either case 1 or case 2 .",
    "let @xmath84 be a lazy random walk on @xmath2 , as defined above .",
    "for all @xmath3 , let @xmath1 be the length of the loop - erased path @xmath85 .",
    "then there exist sequences of constants @xmath86 and @xmath87 satisfying @xmath88 and @xmath89 such that if we define the continuous - time process @xmath90 by @xmath91 then @xmath92 in the skorohod topology as @xmath58 . [ rayleighthm ]",
    "_ we work with the lazy random walk rather than the simple random walk because our proof uses results about the mixing time which require the random walk to be aperiodic .",
    "however , once convergence to the rayleigh process is established for the lazy random walk , it follows easily for the simple random walk with @xmath93 replaced by @xmath94 . _    _ by the results in section 8 of @xcite , when @xmath95 for some @xmath23 , there are positive numbers @xmath96 and @xmath97 such that @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "it follows from the definition of the skorohod metric that we still have @xmath92 in the skorohod topology if we take @xmath100 and @xmath101 for all @xmath5 . _",
    "_ to understand the scaling in case 2 , note that the appropriate time scale for convergence to the rayleigh process is the time scale on which long loops occur , as these long loops correspond to the jumps of the rayleigh process",
    ". given a random walk segment of length @xmath102 , if one removes a segment of length @xmath103 from the middle , then the probability that the two remaining segments intersect ( which would correspond to a long loop ) is the same order of magnitude as the probability that two independent random walk segments of length @xmath102 on @xmath104 started from the uniform distribution intersect .",
    "the expected number of intersection times between two such walks is @xmath105 .",
    "furthermore , if there is one intersection , then there will likely be @xmath106 intersections because two independent random walks of length @xmath5 in @xmath24 started at the origin will intersect @xmath106 times ( see proposition 3.2.3 of @xcite ) . consequently , the intersection probability of two random walks of length @xmath102 on @xmath104 started from the uniform distribution is of order @xmath107 ( see propositions 2.8 and 2.9 of @xcite ) , which is of order one when @xmath102 is of order @xmath108 .",
    "this explains the time scaling in case 2 .",
    "the spatial scaling results from the fact that the number of points remaining after loop - erasure is of order @xmath109 .",
    "_    there are two steps to proving theorem [ rayleighthm ] .",
    "first , we must show the convergence of finite - dimensional distributions .",
    "that is , we need to show that if @xmath110 , then @xmath111 converges weakly to @xmath112 .",
    "this is done in section [ fddsec ] .",
    "then , we must show that the sequence of processes @xmath113 is relatively compact , which we do in section [ tightsec ] .",
    "these results imply that @xmath92 in the skorohod topology ( see theorem 7.8 in chapter 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "fix @xmath114 , and fix times @xmath110 .",
    "our goal in this section is to prove that @xmath115 the proof proceeds in three steps .",
    "first , we review some results concerning the loop - erased random walk on @xmath2 .",
    "next we set up a coupling between the loop - erased random walk and the rayleigh process",
    ". the result ( [ fddeq ] ) will then follow from some bounds for the rayleigh process .",
    "to study the loop - erased random walk on @xmath2 , we follow the strategy introduced by peres and revelle in @xcite of splitting the random walk into shorter segments .",
    "the ideas are the same in cases 1 and 2 , but it is necessary treat the two cases separately",
    ". some of the minor differences in the treatments of the two cases could be avoided , but we prefer to set up the notation so that we can directly invoke results in @xcite and @xcite .    first , consider case 1 . following @xcite ,",
    "let @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "note that ( [ cond2 ] ) implies that @xmath118 is much smaller than @xmath119 when @xmath5 is large .",

    "looks approximately like the path @xmath130 in case 1 and like the path @xmath152 in case 2 .",
