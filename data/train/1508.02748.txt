    "the wang - landau ( wl ) monte carlo method @xcite is a sampling technique that can be used to obtain the density of states ( dos ) of a system .",
    "it has the property of generating a flat histogram in some random walk space , where the parameters for the random walk and the flatness criterion can be chosen according to the system of interest @xcite . due to these characteristics and to the simplicity of the algorithm ,",
    "the wang - landau approach has been studied and applied successfully to different kinds of systems ( see , for examples , @xcite ) , including those with rough free energy landscapes and strong first - order phase transitions , which can not be easily studied with traditional methods .",
    "recently an efficient parallel scheme of the wang - landau method was implemented @xcite , whereby independent random walks are carried out in different overlapping windows of energy and a replica - exchange scheme @xcite is used to exchange system configurations of neighboring energy windows .",
    "this parallel replica exchange wang - landau ( rewl ) method was shown to scale extremely well up to several thousands of computing cores .",
    "therefore , it can be used to study more complex systems and much larger system sizes than it is possible with the serial wang - landau method .    while the density of states as a function of a single parameter , such as the total energy , suffices to provide insight into many systems ,",
    "there are a number of physical properties and systems whose investigation relies on a joint density of states dependent on additional parameters @xcite .",
    "therefore , it would be of great interest to extend the one - dimensional rewl method @xcite to a higher - dimensional parameter space , and implement a similar method that combines enhanced sampling techniques @xcite and the advantages of parallel computing to obtain a joint density of states .    in this exploratory study",
    "we consider the ising model , for which the density of states as a function of total energy is known exactly @xcite .",
    "the phase space of this model , as a function of energy and magnetization , has cusps and empty regions with no realizable configurations .",
    "simulations in this higher - dimensional parameter space are challenging because , depending on the sampling method used , the lower and higher energy edges of the phase space are hard to sample and thus have poor statistics",
    ". moreover , the empty region between cusps can be hard to overcome in a simulation .",
    "the rewl method @xcite is arguably the most successful parallelization attempt to the wl method so far , and it consists of only three simple modifications to the serial version of the algorithm . taking the ising model as an example , a serial wl sampling of the total energy ( @xmath0 ) and magnetization ( @xmath1 ) phase space employs a two - dimensional random walk in the entire @xmath0 and @xmath1 ranges . in the process",
    "a random walker keeps track of the joint density of states @xmath2 and the histogram of visited states @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote , respectively , the current and trial spin configurations of the system . the wl probability that the trial move is accepted is given by @xmath6 .",
    "\\label{p - wl}\\ ] ] if @xmath5 is accepted , the density of states @xmath7 is adjusted by the modification factor @xmath8 , that is , @xmath9 ; and the histogram is updated with @xmath10 .",
    "if the trial state is not accepted , we update @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "one monte carlo step is defined as @xmath13 trial state considerations .    the random walker proceeds with choosing a new trial spin configuration and checking whether it is accepted , until @xmath3 is considered flat , in accordance with a chosen criterion .",
    "at this point the current iteration is ended and the histogram is reset to zero .",
    "the next iteration begins with a finer @xmath14 , reduced by some predefined rule ( e.g. @xmath15 ) .",
    "more iterations are performed until the modification factor reaches a chosen final value @xmath16 , such as @xmath17 .",
    "the density of states is never reset and , at the end of the simulation , @xmath2 is expected to converge to the true value with an accuracy proportional to @xmath18 .",
    "a replica - exchange wang - landau sampling starts by splitting the phase space into smaller overlapping subspaces ( windows ) , as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . for simplicity , only the energy range is split and the subspaces",
    "were artificially displaced vertically ( in fig.[fig1](b ) ) for clarity .",

    "energy windows are shifted upward progressively for clarity . ]    inside each subspace one or more independent random walkers perform a standard wl sampling , with independent @xmath2 and @xmath3 . after a predetermined number of monte carlo steps ,",
    "a configurational exchange between two walkers in adjacent windows is proposed .",
    "the walker pairs are chosen at random . if either of them is not in the overlapping region , the exchange of configurations will not be attempted . however ,",
    "if the walker pairs are in the same overlapping region , the configuration swap between them ( walkers @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) will be accepted with the probability : @xmath21 , \\label{p - acc}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote , respectively , the spin configurations of walkers @xmath19 and @xmath20 before the exchange . note that @xmath24 satisfies detailed balance . all walkers ( in all regions ) move to the next iteration at the same time and the parallel simulation ends when the modification factor for every walker reaches @xmath16 .    at this stage of the simulation , each walker is left with a joint dos fragment ( fig.[fig2](a ) ) and one needs to combine all the fragments to recover @xmath2 over the entire phase space .",
    "to do so , we first sum over the magnetization and obtained the density of states as a function of energy : @xmath25 as shown in fig.[fig2](b ) .",
    "after that we calculate the derivative of @xmath26 $ ] as a function of @xmath0 in the overlapping region . in this procedure",
    ", one finds a point @xmath27 where the difference between the inverse of the microcanonical temperature @xmath28/{\\rm d}e $ ] is a minimum .",
    "this @xmath27 point is used to match and adjust the two adjacent surfaces .",
    "that is , the whole dos surface @xmath2 has to be rescaled at @xmath29 and the joint dos is obtained by : @xmath30 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are , respectively , walkers in the lower and higher energy range and , @xmath31 is the shifted value of @xmath2 for the @xmath20th walker .",

    "@xcite ) . for example",
    ", one might be interested in splitting the magnetization instead of the energy range , or splitting both energy and magnetization ranges . in this case both dimensions of the overlapping phase space will need to be analyzed , one at a time , to find the @xmath27 and @xmath34 matching points .",
    "moreover , since multiple walkers can be used to sample a window simultaneously , it is possible to employ jackknifing or bootstrapping techniques to compute the statistical errors from a unique production run .",
    "from our simulations for the two - dimensional ising model we examine ( @xmath19 ) the generalization of the rewl approach to higher dimensions and ( @xmath35 ) the accuracy of the algorithm .",
    "we carried out serial 2d - wl and 2d - rewl simulations by performing random walks in total energy @xmath0 and magnetization @xmath1 space until the modification factor reaches @xmath36 .",
    "we adopted the @xmath37 flatness criterion , i. e. , all entries in the histogram @xmath3 are no less than the chosen percentage of the average height of the histogram .",
    "for the 2d - rewl simulations we divided the parameter space into equal - sized windows with restricted values of @xmath0 and unrestricted @xmath1 .",
    "we used a constant @xmath38 overlap between neighboring windows and multiple random walkers to keep track of the joint dos within each window .",
    "fig.[fig4](a ) shows the resulting dos that is obtained in a few hours by @xmath39 parallel walkers ( the energy is split into @xmath40 windows with three walkers per window ) .",
    "an equivalent serial wl sampling over the entire two - dimensional parameter space with a single random walker takes several days to complete .    to compare the dos",
    "obtained from wl and rewl sampling ( denoted by @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively ) , we calculated the relative difference : @xmath43    where @xmath44 .",
    "the relative difference is plotted in fig . [ fig4](b ) . over the entire phase space",
    ", there is no apparent sign of systematic errors due to the matching of windows .",
    "the order of magnitude of the relative difference is comparable to the relative errors ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) ) ; they both share the same behavior of having larger values in the lower and upper energy edges .",
    "this is conceivable because of the rareness of configurations as well as the presence of cusps and empty regions in the phase space .",

    "fig.[fig5](b ) shows the relative errors for the simulations employing @xmath45 walkers per window and @xmath46 walkers per window respectively .",

    "the joint dos over the entire two - dimensional parameter space , obtained by combining the joint dos in the different sampled windows , agrees very well with the results obtained with a serial wl sampling over the entire two - dimensional parameter space .",
