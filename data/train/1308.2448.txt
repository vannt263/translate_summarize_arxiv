    "eruptions of solar magnetized plasmas and accompanying phenomena present most vigorous manifestations of the solar activity .",
    "general relations between eruptions and flares have been theoretically understood in 19601970-s and constituted the basis of the standard flare model ( ` cshkp ' ; @xcite ) . associations of eruptive flares with coronal shock waves were predicted by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "later studies ( e.g. , @xcite ; and others ) supplemented the model with ideas about initiation of coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) .    despite the rather long history of theoretical concepts of solar eruptive flares , difficulties still remain in establishing connections between eruptions , flares , cmes , and shock waves in particular events .",
    "there is no consensus about such questions as the excitation scenario of shock waves .",
    "recent observations promise noticeable update of model concepts .",
    "on the other hand , progress in understanding the listed phenomena is currently urged by requirements of modern industry , power , transport , and other high - technology systems .",
    "eruptions and associated phenomena can produce severe space weather disturbances .",
    "cmes carry clouds of magnetized plasmas , which can reach earth and cause geomagnetic storms .",
    "associated shock waves also can affect space weather .",
    "eruptions are accompanied by flare emissions from radio waves up to gamma rays .",
    "solar eruptive events somehow accelerate electrons and protons to high energies .",
    "intense fluxes of accelerated protons sometimes reach the earth orbit being hazardous for equipment and astronauts in space , while people on aircraft in high - latitude flights are exposed to secondary particles .",
    "the origin of solar energetic particles is still vague ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there are two major competing concepts of acceleration of high - energy heavy particles in solar events .",
    "one concept relates their origin with flare processes within an active region ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "another one relates acceleration of protons and heavier ions up to high energies with shock waves associated with cmes ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "specifying temporal properties of the processes , which might be related to acceleration of protons , is among important issues of both solar physics and space weather forecast .    in the widely accepted conjectural scenario of particle acceleration by a shock front",
    ", the shock wave is supposed to develop as a bow shock driven by the outer surface of a super - alfvnic cme ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one of arguments in favor of this scenario is an apparent delay of the extrapolated solar particle release time relative to flare emissions .",
    "this circumstance is considered ` _ _ as further evidence that the particles are accelerated by the shock wave that forms late in the event , when the cme driver of the shock reaches 2 or 3 solar radii _ _ ' [ heliocentric distance , or a height above the solar surface of @xmath1 , @xcite ] .",
    "the concept of the bow shock originates from the analogy with the problem of the supersonic plasma flow around the surface of a solid or elastic body associated with the magnetic bubble of a cme .",
    "two circumstances are important here : ( i )  the flow around the body occurs with the existence of a stagnation point of the plasma flow at the surface of the body , and ( ii )  the motion velocity of this stagnation point exceeds the ambient fast - mode speed .",
    "however , at the cme formation stage , the analogy with such a plasma flow does not apply , even though this flow is a subsonic one . at this stage , the cme magnetic bubble extrudes surrounding magnetoplasmas away almost omnidirectionally , thus forming an extensive disturbed zone of compression around it .",
    "this zone is comparable in size with the initial cme .",
    "the front of this zone is a weak discontinuity running with the ambient fast - mode speed .",
    "the fast - mode speed of the moving plasmas within this zone is higher than the pre - event ambient fast - mode speed .",
    "the boundary of the cme magnetic bubble , i.e. , its outer separatrix surface , is already detectable at this stage due to the growing plasma compression ahead . in the bow - shock concept ,",
    "the cme size and speed ( @xmath2 ) determine the position and intensity of the stationary shock ahead of the cme .",
    "kinematical differences of the structural cme components preceding the appearance of the shock are not discussed in the bow - shock concept .",
    "a significant distinction of their accelerations from the self - similar regime is among these differences .",
    "however , the results of ( ) do not support the bow - shock excitation scenario in the low corona .",
    "instead , it turns out that shock waves are excited by the impulsive - piston mechanism during the rise phase of a flare . in the impulsive - piston concept ,",
    "the wave disturbance is essentially non - stationary .",
    "its intensity is determined by the acceleration of the piston .",
    "the major role of the acceleration can be demonstrated in the following way .",
    "the magnetic flux rope expands in both the major and minor radii simultaneously .",
    "accordingly , the radiation of the magnetosonic wave by an element of the flux rope can be divided into the dipole and monopole components .",
    "the intensity of each component is proportional to the squared acceleration , with which each radius changes .",
    "the sharpest portion in the velocity profile of the disturbance propagating away from the piston forms approximately at the same time as the acceleration reaches its maximum .",
    "this portion is a place , where the discontinuity ( i.e. , shock ) starts to form .",
    "as our previous analyses have shown , the wave front , which appears in the disturbed zone surrounding a cme , is excited by a sharp impulsive eruption inside the developing cme , where a steep outward - directed falloff of the alfvn speed favors amplification of the wave and rapid formation of the discontinuity in @xmath3  s @xcite .",
    "the kinematics of the whole cme determines whether or not the heading portion of the wave transforms into the bow shock afterwards .",
    "this scenario is confirmed by @xcite , who briefly discussed moderate eruptive flares .",
    "it is reasonable to check what occurred in a major event , which has produced a big near - earth enhancement of high - energy proton flux .",
    "the extreme 2006 december 13 solar event observed in detail with many instruments provides this opportunity .",
    "many papers already addressed various aspects of this event .",
    "at least , two eruptive episodes have been revealed ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the event produced large - scale disturbances such as ` euv waves ' and dimmings , the latter being both deep depressions near the active region and shallower remote dimmings ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite followed the related cme and shock wave to the earth orbit and then up to 2.7  au .",
    "several studies addressed the flare ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "some attempts have already been made to find out the origin of near - earth protons ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; ) .",
    "nevertheless , some important questions remain unanswered .",
    "we are not aware of kinematic measurements of eruptions .",
    "relations between the eruptions and extreme flare have not been revealed .",
    "the origin and onset time of the shock wave still remains hypothetical .",
    "some conclusions do not stand against observations or contradict each other .",
    "for example , it is difficult to reconcile the conclusion of @xcite that the major eruption occurred away from the strong fields with the result of @xcite that the high energy release regions tend to be concentrated in local strong field regions .",
    "there is a contradiction between the conclusions of @xcite , who argued in favor of flare - acceleration of solar energetic particles , and the conclusions of ( ) , who favor shock - acceleration of gle particles .    in the present study we endeavor to shed further light on the listed issues based on the approaches and techniques developed by @xcite and briefly described in section  [ s - techniques ] . to reach the purposes listed above , we firstly reveal in section  [ s - time_profiles ] the features of the major phase of the event from its time profiles . in section  [ s - eruptions ] , we measure the kinematical characteristics of eruptions from the images observed with the x - ray telescope ( xrt ; @xcite ) and the solar optical telescope ( sot ; @xcite ) on hinode @xcite .",
    "we then co - ordinate the eruptions with the milestones of the extreme flare shown by the microwave total flux light curves recorded with the nobeyama radio polarimeters ( norp ; @xcite ) .",
    "section  [ s - flare ] considers the development of the extreme flare from microwave images produced with the nobeyama radioheliograph ( norh ; @xcite ) along with norp , xrt , and sot observations starting from the early onset of the flare and up to the end of the second flare peak . in this way , we address the circumstances responsible for the extreme properties of the event .",
    "section  [ s - euv_wave ] reveals near - surface traces of two shock waves following each other , whose onset times and positions quantitatively indicate their excitation by two major eruptions . section  [ s - dynamic_spectrum ] confirms this result by the analysis of the type ii bursts in the dynamic radio spectrum .",
    "section  [ s - cme ] discusses the cme , manifestations of the shock in its structure , and their correspondence with the shock waves revealed in previous sections .",
    "section  [ s - discussion ] coordinates the results into a consistent picture of the whole event and addresses some of the contradicting conclusions drawn previously .",
    "the outcome of the analysis and its implications are summarized in section  [ s - conclusion ] .",
    "imaging observations provide important visual information about eruptions , wavelike disturbances , and flares . in addition",
    ", quantitative kinematical measurements of moving features can shed light on causal relations between the listed phenomena .",
    "such measurements are complicated by difficulties to follow an expanding feature in question due to its rapidly decreasing brightness or opacity , while concurrent flare emissions are very bright .",
    "difficulties to detect an eruptive feature in all images of interest lead to large uncertainties in its position .",
    "a traditional way to measure velocities and accelerations by differentiation of distance - time measurements causes large scatter of results . to overcome this difficulty",
    ", we describe the kinematics of eruptions and wavelike disturbances by analytic functions and calculate the kinematical plots by means of integration or differentiation of the analytic fit rather than the measurements .",
    "the distance - time measurements are used as a starting estimate of kinematical parameters , and then these parameters are adjusted to outline the measured feature in a best way .",
    "our ultimate criterion is to follow the motion of an analyzed feature in images as closely as possible .",
    "several studies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; ; ) have concluded that the acceleration of an eruption or a cme occurs impulsively and temporally close to an associated hxr burst .",
    "using this fact , we consider the initial @xmath4 and final @xmath5 velocities of an eruption to be nearly constant and fit its acceleration with a gaussian , @xmath6 ^ 2}/2 \\ } } / ( \\sqrt{2\\pi}\\tau_{\\mathrm{acc}})$ ] . here",
    "@xmath7 is the fwhm of the acceleration time profile centered at time @xmath8 . in cases of more complex kinematics ,",
    "we use a combination of gaussians and adjust their parameters manually .    with",
    "rather accurately estimated effective duration and center time of the acceleration , its actual shape is rather uncertain because of double integration in calculating the height - time plot , which is directly compared with the observations .",
    "however , the acceleration plot is not expected to contain features shorter than the alfv ' en time inside the measured eruption .",
    "a simple model ( ) describes propagation of impulsively excited shock waves in plasma with a radial power - law density falloff @xmath9 from an eruption center , @xmath10 . here",
    "@xmath11 is the distance , and @xmath12 is the density at a distance of @xmath13 mm ( close to the scale height ) .",
    "propagation of the global front of such a shock wave is almost insensitive to the magnetic field , but is determined by the plasma density distribution , @xmath14 .",
    "this equation is more convenient to use in a form @xmath15^{2/(5-\\delta)}$ ] , where @xmath16 and @xmath11 are the current time and distance , @xmath8 is the wave onset time , and @xmath17 correspond to one of the measured fronts .    for the shock propagation along the solar surface",
    ", this simple approximation also provides close results to those produced with the analytic modeling of weak shock waves @xcite .",
    "we use the same approximation to fit the expansion of shock - associated cme components as well as the drift rate of type ii bursts .",
    "figure  [ fig : timeprof ] characterizes the overall course of the event . the soft x - ray ( sxr ) flux of the flare reached the x3.4 level ( figure  [ fig : timeprof]a ) . two major flare peaks at 02:25 and 02:29 are conspicuous at 17 and 80 ghz ( figure  [ fig : timeprof]c , d ) . weaker quasi - periodic peaks with an interval of @xmath18  min pronounced at lower frequencies continued afterwards for more than one hour .    ( 85mm,130mm)timeprofs.eps    figure  [ fig : timeprof]b shows the derivatives of the two sxr goes channels ( splined 3-sec data ) .",
    "the derivative of the 18    channel is inconclusive , because a subsidiary peak ( the question mark ) is most likely an artifact due to the discrete ` staircase ' time profile , which started at that time .",
    "the second peak at 02:29 is obviously absent in the 0.54    channel thus deviating from the neupert effect @xcite .",
    "this issue will be addressed in section  [ s - neupert_effect ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : timeprof]e presents evolution of the microwave peak ( turnover ) frequency computed from norp total flux data by using the second - order fit of instant log - log spectra averaged over 1.2  s ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the turnover frequency reaches very high values , exceeding 35 ghz during the first peak and 17 ghz during the second peak . according to expressions of @xcite ,",
    "this fact along with very high flux densities @xmath19  sfu observed at 17 and 80 ghz indicates emission from very large number of high - energy electrons in strongest magnetic fields . flaring during the first peak most likely was stronger and harder than during the second one .",
    "the microwave - emitting source was certainly optically thick at both 17 and 34 ghz during the first peak and at 17 ghz during the second peak .",
    "however , the turnover frequency of @xmath20  ghz during the second peak does not guarantee that the 34 ghz source was optically thin at that time @xcite .",
    "rhessi missed the first peak and the onset of the second peak due to nighttime ( figure  [ fig : timeprof]f ) .",
    "subsequent evolution of the hard x - ray ( hxr ) emission in the 2550 and 50100 kev ranges shows progressive softening of the hxr spectrum supporting the assumption that the missed first peak could be still harder .",
    "a huge decimetric burst reached almost half a million sfu at 1  ghz ( figure  [ fig : timeprof]g ) .",
    "its enormous intensity and a sharp spiky time profile indicate an underlying coherent emission mechanism interpreted by @xcite as electron - cyclotron maser ( ecm ) .",
    "this burst was only superseded by a burst on december 6 from the same active region 10930 .",
    "these huge radio bursts caused failures of the gps and glonass navigation systems ( ; @xcite ) .",
    "eruptions in the 2006 december 13 event were previously considered by @xcite ( eruptions ef2 and ef3 in our notation ) , @xcite ( eruption ef2 ) , and @xcite ( eruption ef1 ) .",
    "nevertheless , their kinematics has not been studied so far .",
    "we analyzed the eruptions from sxr hinode / xrt images .",
    "their motions were measured in the same way as ( ) did ( see section  [ s - techniques ] ) .",
    "we firstly measured the positions of the leading edge of each eruptive feature from the images .",
    "the measured points were used as starting estimates to find the initial and final velocities .",
    "then we endeavored to reproduce the motion of a feature in question by describing its acceleration time profile of a gaussian shape .",
    "the kinematic parameters were adjusted in sequential attempts to follow the motion of a feature in question as closely as possible .",
    "the motion of the second eruption was more complex : its acceleration was immediately followed by strong deceleration .",
    "we used its acceleration profile as a combination of two gaussian curves and adjusted their parameters manually .",
    "hinode / xrt images reveal three eruptive features following each other .",
    "figure  [ fig : eruption1 ] presents the first eruptive feature ef1 ( left : direct images , right : image ratios ) , which was weakly visible as a faint elongated brightening extended east  west .",
    "ef1 separated from a bright bundle of loops and moved south in the plane of the sky .",
    "as @xcite showed , the initial position of this eruptive feature coincided with the magnetic polarity inversion ( neutral ) line , which is highlighted in figures  [ fig : eruption1]a  c by the brightest loop - like bundle arranged along it .",
    "the displacement from the initial position of the horizontal dashed line crossing the southernmost bend of ef1 was calculated from the solid acceleration plot in figure  [ fig : accelerations]a .",
    "this feature probably was a magnetic flux rope structure , as its initial position along the neutral line implies .",
    "the acceleration of ef1 reached in the plane of the sky 1  km  s@xmath21 at 02:20:30 , and its speed reached 110  km  s@xmath22 , while ef1 was visible .",

    "the acceleration plot of ef2 is presented with the dotted curve in figure  [ fig : accelerations]a .",
    "ef2 accelerated up to 8  km  s@xmath21 at 02:23 , reached 750  km  s@xmath22 , and then strongly decelerated to 456  km  s@xmath22 .",
    "@xcite provided a close estimate of its plane - of - sky speed of 650  km  s@xmath22 .",
    "they also revealed a strong blue shift of emission whose hot ( @xmath23  mk ) source was close to this feature ( ` bs2 ' in their notation ) from spectroscopic data of hinode / eis at 02:2202:24 .",
    "the authors considered ef2 as a manifestation of an mhd shock wave .",
    "however , properties of feature ef2 are inconsistent with its wave nature .",
    "@xcite considered feature ef2 as a magnetic loop system pushed outward by some core eruption , so that the initial position of ef2 might have coincided with a static loop in figure  [ fig : eruption2]a .",
    "nevertheless , excitation of shock waves in this event conjectured by @xcite is undoubted as shown by , e.g. , @xcite , and we will confirm this later .",
    "( 170mm,34mm)eruption2.eps    before comparison of the kinematical properties of the eruptive features ef1 , ef2 , and ef3 with different observational facts , now we try to understand what feature ef2 could be in nature .",
    "this eruptive feature was the largest in size and most impulsive in this event .",
    "the eruption has resulted in the appearance of the double major regions of coronal dimming on the periphery of ar  10930 ( see ; @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : eruption2_dimming ] presents the eruption of ef2 , the dimming regions , and the soho / mdi magnetogram produced at 01:40 , short before the event .",
    "the dimming regions were revealed from a difference of the soho / eit 195    images observed after the event and before it . the criterion to select dimming was a brightness decrease by 25 counts / pixel ( the quiet sun s level was 40 counts / pixel ) .",
    "to eliminate complicating small - scale structural features , both the eit difference image and the magnetogram were smoothed by convolution with a two - dimensional gaussian kernel ( 4 pixels width ) .",
    "( 80mm,128mm)eruption2_dim.eps    the solid curves in figure  [ fig : eruption2_dimming ] outline the clearly visible parts of ef2 ; the dashed curves outline their possible extensions ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : eruption2 ] ) .",
    "comparison of figures [ fig : eruption2_dimming ] and [ fig : eruption2 ] shows that the eastern end of the ` bow ' was fixed and located within the large dimming region d1 , whose magnetic polarity was positive ( figure  [ fig : eruption2_dimming]c ) .",
    "thus , the western end of the bow - like feature ef2 must be rooted in a negative - polarity region .",
    "as the outlining curves indicate , the western end of ef2 was most likely located in the dimming region d2 dominated by the negative polarity .    in classical ` double dimming ' events , coronal dimming regions are considered as the opposite - polarity footpoints of the ejected cme s flux rope @xcite .",
    "this concept appears to be consistent with the discussed properties of feature ef2 , which was probably an eruptive flux rope , the largest one and most impulsive in this event .",
    "the magnetic fields enveloping the progenitor of the flux rope from above in the strongest - field part of ar  10930 were directed northward , and the axial field was directed westward , as figure  [ fig : eruption2_dimming]c shows .",
    "this arrangement of the magnetic polarities agrees with the left handedness of the active region indicated by its mirrored - s - shaped configuration and the negative helicity of the corresponding near - earth magnetic cloud @xcite .",
    "the progression of reconnection caused by the eruption formed the flare arcade , whose development involved strongest magnetic fields between the sunspots . the process seems to be well described by the standard flare model .",
    "a seemingly contradiction with the conclusion of @xcite about the major eruption aside of strong fields ( their figures 6 , 8 and 9 ) will be reconciled in section  [ s - cme ] .",
    "the second eruptive episode probably inspired eruption of the third feature ef3 presented in figure  [ fig : eruption3 ] .",
    "its acceleration plot is shown with a dashed curve in figure  [ fig : accelerations]a .",
    "feature ef3 was initially located along the neutral line ; probably , it was also a flux rope .",
    "ef3 underwent two acceleration episodes .",
    "the first , a weaker one , occurred simultaneously with acceleration of ef2 at 02:23 .",
    "this determined its appearance simultaneously with the first microwave peak .",
    "the maximum acceleration of ef3 reached 5  km  s@xmath21 at 02:27 with a final speed of 420  km  s@xmath22 .",
    "@xcite revealed a strong blue shift for this feature also ( bs1 in their notation ) and interpreted it as an ejected plasmoid . the plane - of - sky speed estimated by the authors ,",
    "@xmath24  km  s@xmath22 , was less than our measurements show ( probably due to difficulties to reveal its faint latest manifestation at 02:28:18 in figure  [ fig : eruption3]e ) , while its line - of - sight speed of @xmath25  km  s@xmath22 estimated by @xcite seems to agree with our result .",
    "( 170mm,35mm)eruption3.eps    from the fact that the appearance of ef3 corresponded to the first microwave peak recorded with norp @xcite reasonably concluded that the flare was a product of magnetic reconnection induced by the eruption .",
    "comparison of the detailed acceleration plots for eruptive features ef1 , ef2 , and ef3 in figure  [ fig : accelerations]a with microwave bursts in figure  [ fig : accelerations]b reveals a relation between them , which appears to be still more impressive .    figure  [ fig : accelerations]b presents the microwave time profiles at 17 ghz ( black solid ) and at 9.4 ghz ( gray , a magnified initial part ) along with normalized acceleration plots from figure  [ fig : accelerations]a shown with the same line styles and arbitrarily shifted by 2  min later . the early rise of the 9.4 ghz emission coincides with the delayed acceleration of ef1 , and the 17 ghz time profile exhibits a striking similarity with the delayed acceleration curves of ef2 and ef3 .",
    "thus , the flare bursts were caused by the eruptions and not vice versa .",
    "each eruption apparently was causally related with another and preceded a flare burst .",
    "this relation is consistent with the standard flare model , especially in its modern form . @xcite numerically simulated mhd processes caused by a wide variety of magnetic structures and compared the results with hinode imaging data .",
    "according to their conclusion , the trigger of the 2006 december 13 flare manifested in the eruption of ef1 ; this is consistent with the measured temporal relation between the acceleration of ef1 and the microwave flare emission presented in our figure  [ fig : accelerations ] .",

    "it is not possible to measure its motion from a single image . assuming that its relation to microwaves was approximately the same as for the preceding eruptions",
    ", one might assume the onset of its motion at the early rise of the next microwave peak marked by the dotted line in figure  [ fig : timeprof ] ( 02:32:30 ) or about 2 min before , i.e. , at 02:2902:31 .",

    "the plane - of - sky speed of its leading edge should be 250400  km  s@xmath22 , which seems to be reasonable .",
    "thus , association of the eruptive feature ef4 with the next , smaller flare peak at 02:32:30 is possible .",
    "( 85mm,87mm)eruption4.eps    the time profiles of accelerations in figure  [ fig : accelerations ] had a quasi - periodic character .",
    "eruption of ef4 probably followed this trend .",
    "we remind that the quasi - periodic pulsations continued long afterwards in microwaves .",
    "this circumstance induces thinking about possible causes of the oscillatory behavior of this event and the role of the oscillations in triggering the eruptions .",
    "however , this issue is beyond our scope .",
    "@xcite have shown that microwave emission of active region 10930 at 17 ghz in relatively quiet conditions during a week before the december 13 flare was dominated by a neutral line source ( nls ) .",
    "such long - lived sources reside in the vicinity of the main neutral line where the horizontal magnetic component is maximum @xcite .",
    "emission of a nls at 17 ghz is dominated by either the top of footpoints of a low - lying bundle of loop - like structures rooted in strong magnetic fields of sunspots .",
    "such microwave sources are due to gyroresonance emission at the fourth or even third harmonic of the gyrofrequency , i.e. , the magnetic field strength in the corona reaches 15002000  g at a place where a nls resides ( ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , existence of a nls in ar  10930 indicates very strong magnetic field in the corona .",
    "such sources are only observed in active regions which produce goes x class flares .",
    "the nls had a brightness temperature of 0.30.5 mk .",
    "it was located above the neutral line , approximately in the middle between the main sunspots of opposite polarities , where the eruptive feature ef1 originated . on december 12 ,",
    "the nls shifted to the larger northern sunspot of s - polarity and persisted there until the flare onset ( and reappeared after the flare ) .",
    "the flare started close to the position of the nls or exactly there .",
    "this situation appears to be a typical one @xcite .",
    "when the flare started , the major microwave emission was contributed by gyrosynchrotron from high - energy electrons . before considering the flare course in microwave images we recall that the turnover frequency of the microwave spectrum in figure  [ fig : timeprof]e reached 47 ghz during the first peak .",
    "thus , the microwave source at that time was certainly optically thick at both operating frequencies of norh 17 and 34 ghz .",
    "we therefore limit our analysis with consideration of 17 ghz emission only and take advantage of polarization data available at 17 ghz .",
    "to produce images at 17 ghz , we used the fujiki program for the rise phase of the flare . very bright microwave sources during the peaks considerably exceeded 100  mk that makes impossible usage of standard imaging software of norh . therefore , after 02:24 we used the program developed by h.  koshiishi for imaging of extreme flares .",
    "calibration of the images in brightness temperatures was performed by referring to total fluxes recorded with norp as proposed by k.  shibasaki .",
    "one of major difficulties in analyses of microwave images along with those produced in different spectral domains is their accurate coalignment , because norh does not provide an absolute pointing .",
    "we overcome this problem by comparing the norh images with the flare ribbons shown by hinode / sot in the ca h - line and by comparing the polarized microwave emission ( stokes @xmath26 component ) with the magnetograms of hinode / sot and soho / mdi as shown in figure  [ fig : overlay ] .",

    "we used 3-sec goes data . their discrete ` staircase ' character disfavoring differentiation was overcome by means of smooth cubic spline approximation with cross - validation for estimation of the smoothing parameter .",
    "the result presented in figure  [ fig : timeprof]b demonstrates that the derivative of the 0.54    channel responded to the first ( 02:25:11 ) and third ( 02:32:30 ) peaks , while the second peak at 02:29:00 was absent .",
    "the derivative of the 18    channel is inconclusive , because a peak indicated with the question mark is most likely an artifact .",
    "indeed , there was a deviation from the neupert effect which @xcite explained by ` _ _ an effective escape of accelerated particles into interplanetary space rather than their precipitation into dense layers of the solar atmosphere _ _ ' .",
    "however , if accelerated electrons escaped , then no corresponding microwave peak occurred , and the neupert effect worked perfectly in such a case . strong flux of precipitating electrons is evidenced by the strong hard x - ray burst at that time in figure  [ fig : timeprof]f .",
    "a reason for the deviation from the neupert effect is apparently due to deficiency of the soft x - ray emission .",
    "this emission is produced by evaporated plasmas confined in closed coronal structures .",
    "the next eruption most likely opened some of them thus releasing confined thermal plasma .",
    "expansion of escaping plasma should dramatically reduce the emission measure in soft x - rays and diminish the second peak in the derivative .",
    "thus , a deviation from the neupert effect in a multi - peak event might be indicative of an additional eruption .",
    "furthermore , the presence of two or more major peaks in the hard x - ray or microwave time profile of a flare might be indicative of more than one eruption .",
    "this conjecture is supported by the fact that more than one type ii burst are registered in some events .",
    "accordingly , at least , two ( or possibly even three ) shock waves developed in the 2006 december 13 event . the onset times of shock  1 and shock  2 correspond to the acceleration peaks of two eruptive features ef2 and ef3 , respectively . both shocks developed about 2 min before the corresponding flare peaks",
    ". the initial positions of the shock wave centers confirm their association with the eruptions .",
    "being excited by the impulsive - piston mechanism , the shock waves detached from the pistons and quasi - freely propagated for some time like decelerating blast waves .",
    "manifestations of the two shocks following each other in euv images and in the dynamic radio spectrum correspond to each other .",
    "local deviations of the wave fronts in regions of increased fast - mode speed from isotropic propagation and progressive displacement of the wave centers toward the coronal hole confirm their mhd wave nature .",
    "all of these circumstances strongly support the expectations of @xcite for the development and evolution of shock waves .",
    "@xcite studied evolution of coronal dimmings starting from their appearance and especially the post - cme recovery in two events , one of which was 2006 december 13 .",
    "the authors considered a possibility for remote dimmings ( which they called secondary ) to be formed due to the pass of the shock front .",
    "this mechanism was assessed to be insufficient to account for long - lived dimmings , because consequences of a shock wave were considered to be reversible at short time scales like those of weak disturbances .",
    "however , figure  [ fig : eit_sxi ] clearly shows that expansion of the zone of dimming was directly associated with propagation of the coronal shock wave over the solar surface .",
    "the wave front is a moving boundary of a large - scale mhd flow , which accompanies the expansion and eruption of magnetic structures associated with a cme drawing away from the sun . at the stage ,",
    "when the cme is formed and accelerates , this flow has a character of a lateral expansion of coronal magnetoplasmas being similar to a blow of wind directed outward .",
    "consequences of this flow for a coronal loop depend on its size and orientation .",
    "the lower portion of the wave front is tilted toward the solar surface @xcite , and therefore low loops and filaments should be initially pressed sideward - down , thus producing brightenings just behind the wave front .",
    "a very high coronal loop should be initially displaced sideward - up like a sail .",
    "stretch of such loops should cause plasma outflow from their basis , thus producing dimmings .",
    "the recovery of the dimmings formed in such a way requires a considerable time , much longer than the timescale of their appearance .",
    "thus , the development of remote dimmings also could be due to the pass of the shock front .",
    "eit and sxi images of this event have provided a unique opportunity to reveal two shocks following each other along the solar surface . on the other hand ,",
    "the two shock fronts propagating upwards most likely merged into a single stronger shock , whose propagation is consistent with the observed expansion of the cme s leading edge .",
    "the shock monotonically decelerated .",
    "deceleration of a shock front along with a nearly constant established speed of a cme behind it suggests that their extrapolated height - time plots should intersect after some time .",
    "the actual outcome depends on the cme speed .",
    "if the cme is slow as was the case in the event addressed by @xcite , then the shock should eventually decay into a weak disturbance .",
    "if the cme is fast which was the case in the 2006 december 13 event , then the blast - wave - like shock should eventually transform into a bow shock ahead of the cme .",
    "the latter scenario is confirmed by velocity profiles of shocks ahead of interplanetary cmes ( icmes ) measured in situ at large distances from the sun .",
    "these velocity profiles are typical of bow shocks continuously pushed by trailing pistons .",
    "this was also the case for the interplanetary shock wave developed in the 2006 december 13 event analyzed in detail by @xcite , who followed its subsequent propagation up to 2.73 au .",
    "excitation of shock waves and their evolution turns out more complex than traditionally assumed .",
    "presumption of a ` cme - driven shock ' directly excited exceptionally in the bow - shock scenario by the outer cme surface at a considerable height well after the flare appears to be misleading oversimplification .",
    "case studies of very different events with importance from less then goes c - class ( see @xcite ) up to the extreme x - class event in the present study confirm the same impulsive - piston shock formation inside a developing cme",
    ". actually sharp mhd disturbances , which transform into shock waves , appear at the rise phase of hard x - ray and microwave burst being ready to accelerate particles to high energies and only dampen and decelerate afterwards .",
    "thus , considerations of relative timing of energetic particles with respect to a flare do not provide any support to their acceleration by shock waves .",
    "prompt acceleration of protons to high energies simultaneously with electrons during flares is confirmed in occasional observations of the @xmath52-decay emission , which is generated by @xmath53 mev protons precipitating into dense layers of the solar atmosphere @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , escape of flare - accelerated particles from an active region should be favored by stretch of closed magnetic configurations in the course of cme lift - off ( k .- l .",
    "klein , 2011 , private communication ) . if the expanding magnetic flux rope of the cme reconnects with a coronal streamer ( e.g. , above the parent active region ) , then the particles trapped in the flux rope gain access to magnetic fields open into the interplanetary space ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "for this reason , the presence of an apparent delay of particle release near the sun after the flare seems to favor particle acceleration in the flare rather than by a shock .",
    "as mentioned , the 70-th ground level enhancement ( gle ) of cosmic ray intensity produced by the 2006 december 13 event was analyzed in several studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the conclusions about a possible solar source of gle particles are different .",
    "some of them allow contributions from both flare - related and shock - related acceleration , and some others favor the only certain source . a number of studies endeavors to reach certain conclusions in statistical or comparative analyses .",
    "such a comparative analysis has been undertaken by ( ) who compared the 2006 december 13 event responsible for gle70 with the 2005 january 20 event responsible for gle69 .",
    "the authors conclusions are nearly opposite for these two events , while our results as well as those of @xcite for the gle69 event appear to be very similar .",
    "in particular , flares in both events occurred in very strong magnetic fields above the umbrae of sunspots and produced very strong microwave bursts with peak frequencies exceeding 25  ghz .",
    "the major circumstances which have led ( ) to contrasting these two events are as follows .    1 .",
    "hard x - ray and gamma - ray emissions were considerably stronger in the event responsible for gle69 with respect to the gle70 event .",
    "+  however , there is no information about these emissions in the strongest peak on 2006 december 13 because of rhessi nighttime ( figure  [ fig : timeprof]f ) .",
    "relative timing of particle injection and flare emissions disfavor their association .",
    "+  such considerations are inconsistent due to the preceding item and conclusions in section  [ s - shock_waves ] .",
    "the gle69-related cme was considerably slower ( 882 km  s@xmath22 ) than the gle70-related one ( 1773 km  s@xmath22 ) .",
    "+  indeed , the soho lasco cme catalog presents the speed of 882 km  s@xmath22 for the 2005 january 20 event , but with a note that it might be underestimated due to strong contamination of lasco images by energetic particles . the note refers to an estimate of @xcite of 3242 km  s@xmath22 .",
    "different estimates for the speed of this cme presented by @xcite range from 2000 to 2600 km  s@xmath22 .",
    "thus , the situation was opposite to the assumption of ( ): the gle69-related cme was considerably faster than the gle70-related one .",
    "the type ii burst ( in a range of 0.11 mhz ) in the gle69 event was ` less dynamic ' than that in the gle70 event .",
    "+  such a comparison should necessarily refer to locations of the emission sources .",
    "@xcite have confirmed the idea of @xcite that a type ii emission appears in a flare - like process running along the current sheet of a coronal streamer stressed by a shock front .",
    "the images of the 2005 january 20 event in the cme catalog show plasma outflow in both western streamers closest to the eruption site .",
    "these streamers probably could not generate the type ii burst .",
    "its source region could be in a remote eastern streamer . before reaching it ,",
    "the flank of the shock wave should have been considerably decelerated . on the other hand ,",
    "no obstacles are seen for the appearance of a type ii burst from the closest western streamers in the 2006 december 13 event .",
    "there is no convincing reason for contrasting the events responsible for gle69 and gle70 .",
    "the solar events were rather similar in their major properties which determined their extremeness , while several qualitative and quantitative differences were certainly present .",
    "our multi - spectral analysis of the extreme 2006 december 13 event involving microwave total flux measurements and imaging data has revealed its important properties .",
    "the observations along with their quantitative descriptions constitute a consistent picture of the event that clearly shows the following .",
    "1 .   development of this eruptive flare appears to be well described by the standard model .",
    "the flare arcade developed in the course of a few eruptions . 2 .",
    "the flare episodes were caused by the eruptions being delayed after them .",
    "the repetitive eruptions additionally opened the coronal configuration permitting escape of evaporated plasmas that has resulted in a deviation from the neupert effect .",
    "the flare emissions were strongest and hardest when flaring occurred in the strongest magnetic fields above the sunspot umbrae .",
    "at least , two shock waves were excited by the eruptions as impulsive pistons inside a developing cme and before the related flare peaks .",
    "then the shock waves quasi - freely propagated like decelerating blast waves .",
    "the two shock waves propagating upward most likely merged into a single stronger shock , which constituted the outer halo envelope of the cme and only decelerated within the lasco field of view .",
    "transition into the bow - shock regime most likely occurred at a larger distance from the sun .    on the other hand ,",
    "the analysis and considerations provide better understanding what do microwaves show .",
    "the strong dependence of the energy release on the magnetic field strength emphasizes emissions from strong - field regions .",
    "they are additionally emphasized by the strong dependence on the magnetic field of the microwave emission . as section  [ s - flare ]",
    "has demonstrated , weaker microwave sources should not be neglected as they show important parts of the flare configuration and its development .",
    "this extreme event confirms the conclusions about the nature of coronal shock waves drawn by @xcite from observations of weaker events .",
    "the shock - wave nature of the disturbances observed in this event is confirmed by the close quantitative correspondence of their development to the expected propagation of shock waves , whose excitation coincided in time and space with strongest accelerations of eruptive flux ropes .",
    "those were near - surface `` euv waves '' , tracers of the type ii bursts , and the leading edge of the cme .",
    "these disturbances were super - alfnic , at least , during some time after their appearance , and only decelerated afterwards .",
    "the scenario revealed for the event disagrees with the delayed cme - driven bow - shock hypothesis : the shock developed much earlier and could accelerate protons before the flare peak .",
    "the delayed particle release time , which is sometimes inferred with respect to the flare , can actually be due to the expansion of the cme magnetic rope , where accelerated particles are trapped .",
    "they can be released , when the rope reconnects with a streamer .",
    "thus , the late particle release time is not a consisting argument in favor of exceptional shock - acceleration of solar energetic particles .",
