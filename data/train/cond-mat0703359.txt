    "electron - electron interaction is known to produce the most pronounced effects in one dimensional electron liquid ( 1d el ) systems , where a strongly correlated state appears  @xcite .",
    "the effects of interactions in higher than one dimensional systems has been masterfully explained by landau s fermi liquid theory  @xcite dealing with low - lying excitations in a system .",
    "landau called such single - particle excitations quasiparticles and postulated a one - to - one correspondence between the quasiparticles and the excited states of a non - interacting fermi gas .",
    "however , for the 1d el any individual excitation becomes a collective one .",
    "this collectivization of excitations is obviously a major difference between the 1d and higher dimensions electron liquids .",
    "it clearly invalidates any possibility to have a fermi liquid theory in 1d el .",
    "one of the most interesting characteristics of the system is the spin - charge separation seen in a series of remarkable experiments  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , according to the theorem proved by lieb and mattis  @xcite , the ground state of a 1d el is paramagnetic .",
    "the recent quantum monte carlo calculations  @xcite consonant with the lieb and mattis theorem predicts no bloch instability  @xcite for the 1d el .",
    "many of the electron - electron interaction effects become increasingly important as carrier density and dimensionality are reduced and the homogenous electron liquid provides a primitive model for their study .",
    "the crucial role in the theory is played by the particle pair distribution function @xmath0 . in our previous works we presented a theory of the pair distribution function and other ground - state properties of the 3d and 2d electron liquid  @xcite .",
    "the theory was based on a fermi hypernetted - chain approximation ( fhnc ) which represents a direct generalization to the fermi systems of the well known hypernetted - chain euler - lagrange ( hnc / el ) approximation .",
    "one of the important feature of theory based on hnc / el or fhnc is that the theory sums not only all ring and ladder diagrams exactly , but also mixed diagrams in a local approximation  @xcite .",
    "it means the fhnc theory is not a fermi liquid theory and therefore we able to apply it for studying many - body effects on 1d el .",
    "as we shall see , much higher sophistication is needed to attain a quantitatively useful theory in 1d el .",
    "we shall have to dwell on terms beyond the fhnc/0 , which includes elementary diagrams and the three - body jastrow - feenberg correlations .",
    "these effects have been studied theoretically in boson fluids for the 1d system using the hnc / el formalism by krotscheck _",
    "@xcite .",
    "the main purpose of the present work is the formulation of a practicable theory for charge correlations in the paramagnetic 1d el and comparison of its numerical predictions with the available diffusion monte carlo data  @xcite .",
    "the theory is based on variational fhnc  @xcite method made by simplifying the standard fhnc method to have only one euler - lagrange schrdinger equation .",
    "the computational time typically needed to obtain @xmath0 at each value of density is a few minutes on a pc with a pentium iv/3.4 ghz processor .",
    "there are many theoretical works addressing the ground - state properties of the quasi- and strictly  @xcite 1d el but an accurate charge correlations is still missing .    in this work , we numerically study the many - body effects for 1d el by calculating the pair distribution function and electron - electron effective interactions .",
    "we consider a 1d el as a model for a system of electronic carriers with band mass @xmath3 in a semiconductor heterostructure with dielectric constant @xmath4 .",
