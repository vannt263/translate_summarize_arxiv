    "the generation of continuous variable ( cv ) entangled light has attracted a significant interest due to a potential application in quantum information science , specifically in quantum teleportation  @xcite , quantum telecloning  @xcite , and quantum dense coding  @xcite .",
    "continuous variables offer the possibility to create entanglement deterministically and different nonlinear processes have been proposed to generate cv two - mode entangled beams  @xcite including nondegenerate parametric down - conversion  @xcite and nondegenerate four - wave mixing processes  @xcite .",
    "recently , the four - wave mixing process has been proposed as a potential source of narrow - band entangled beams , an important resource for quantum memory storage  @xcite and long - distance communications  @xcite .    of particular interest for cv entanglement",
    "are cavity qed systems where entanglement between cavity modes can be created by coupling the modes to an atomic system or nonlinear crystal located inside the cavity  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that for the generation of entanglement between cavity modes , it is essential to create a coherence in the coupling ( or entangling ) system .",
    "typical systems for entangling the modes are multi - level atoms or nonlinear crystals where the coherence can be established initially by a preparation of the atoms in a linear superposition of their energy states or can be created dynamically by a suitable driving of the atoms through four - wave mixing  @xcite or raman - type processes  @xcite .",
    "the coherence is subjected to dissipation due to the decoherence process and over a long time it might be difficult to maintain the coherence large enough for entangling the cavity modes .",
    "the main source of decoherence is spontaneous emission resulting from the interaction of the atoms with the environment . on a microscopic scale ,",
    "the spontaneous emission can be reduced or even completely eliminated , but it could be difficult to eliminate on a macroscopic scale where one would like to create entanglement using macroscopic atomic ensembles .",
    "this raises an important question of how to eliminate the decoherence or how to maintain a large coherence in the presence of the decoherence .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a system formed by a three - level atom located inside a two mode cavity that can generate the maximal stationary entanglement between the cavity modes in the presence of decoherence .",
    "the atom is modelled as a v - type system where the dipole allowed transitions can be independent of each other or can be correlated through the spontaneously generated coherence ( sgc )  @xcite .",
    "the atom is driven by an external laser field coupled exclusively to only one of the atomic transitions .",
    "we use the dressed - atom approach and show that the effective three - level system of dressed states comprises a suitable medium for a non - linear coupling between the cavity modes .",
    "we work in the strong driving limit which assumes that the rabi frequency of the laser field is much larger than the transition damping rates and the coupling strengths of the cavity modes to the atomic transitions .",
    "this prompts us to apply the secular approximation which ignores the coupling of the populations of the dressed states to the coherences .",
    "it is known that non - secular terms , although small can have a destructive effect on coherence effects  @xcite or may even have constructive effects and lead to interesting novel features  @xcite .",
    "however , we are interested in features created by the sgc rather than features created by the coherence induced by the driving field and therefore neglect the non - secular terms .",
    "we consider four scenarios , where the cavity modes couple to the same or different atomic transitions that could be correlated or independent of each other .",
    "the first scenario represents a situation in which the atomic transitions are independent of each other and both cavity modes couple to the same atomic transition that , in addition , is driven by a strong and in general off - resonant laser field .",
    "physically , this system behaves as a driven two - level system and the driving field occurs as a dressing field for the atoms .",
    "we demonstrate that the necessary and sufficient conditions for generation of the maximal entanglement between the modes is to create the complete population inversion between the dressed states of the coupling atomic system .",
    "a population difference between the dressed states occurs for an off - resonant driving field . since for a strong driving field there is no coherence between the dressed states",
    ", one could conclude that the entanglement occurs without coherence in this case .",
    "however , for a detuned driving field , a coherence actually occurs between the two bare states of the system .",
    "in other words , in the bare atom picture , the entanglement is created with coherence .",
    "we find that the maximal entanglement can not be created in this scenario since it is not possible to create a large population difference between the dressed states and at the same time maintain a strong coupling between the cavity modes mediated by the atom .    in the second scenario ,",
    "we include the coupling between the atomic transitions through the sgc , a close analog on the schemes of quantum - state engineering by dissipation  @xcite .",
    "we find that in this case , the dissipation is used to create the required coherence in the atomic system .",
    "the maximal stationary entanglement can be created on demand even for the resonant driving field by tuning the rabi frequency of the field to the difference between the atomic transition frequencies . as a result",
    ", the atomic system evolves into a pure trapping state which is an asymmetric superposition of the degenerate energy states .",
    "the particular pure state into which the atomic system evolves depends upon the ratio of the damping rates of the atomic transitions and the detuning of the laser frequency from the atomic transition frequency . the trapping effect results in the complete population inversion between the dressed states of the system .",
    "in other words , the maximal steady state entanglement is generated when the population of the atomic system is trapped in a pure superposition state .    in the third scenario",
    ", we assume that the cavity modes are coupled to different atomic transitions .",
    "the new feature of this scenario is that now the generation of entanglement is independent of the population of the dressed states .",
    "the necessary condition for entanglement is the creation of coherence between the atomic transitions , the coherence that can be created by the sgc .",
    "finally , in the fourth scenario , we consider the most general configuration in which each of the cavity modes is coupled to both atomic transitions . we show that this scenario can be treated as a combination of the second and third scenarios , and find that the generation of entanglement depends now on the mutual polarization of the atomic dipole moments . depending on whether the transition dipole moments",
    "are parallel or anti - parallel , the entanglement can be enhanced ( reduced ) by the constructive ( destructive ) interference between the atomic transition amplitudes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "[ sec2 ] with a description of the proposed schemes for the generation of entanglement between two nondegenerate cavity modes and derive the master equation for the reduced density operator of the cavity modes . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we study the generation and enhancement of entanglement between the cavity modes for different coupling configurations of the cavity modes to the atomic transitions .",
    "we are particularly interested in the role of the mutual polarization of the atomic dipole moments and the conditions for the generation of a large stationary entanglement between the modes .",
    "the physical origin of entanglement between the cavity modes is explained in terms of population trapping in a linear superposition of the atomic levels .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in sec .",
    "we consider a three - level atom located inside a two - mode cavity .",
    "the atom is modelled as a v - type system with ground state @xmath0 , and two excited states @xmath1 and @xmath2 separated in frequency by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are atomic transition frequencies between states @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",

    "this choice , of course , involves no loss of generality",

    "[ fig1a ] .",
    "the dipole moments of the two allowed atomic transitions can be orthogonal or non - orthogonal to each other .",

    "the coefficient @xmath39 is a measure of the amount of coherence , the so - called sgc , induced by dissipation between the @xmath6 and @xmath7 atomic transitions .",
    "the source of this coherence has an obvious interpretation .",
    "namely , spontaneously emitted photon on one of the atomic transition drives the other transition .",
    "the degree of the coherence , measured by the coefficient @xmath40 , depends explicitly on the mutual polarization of the transition dipole moments with @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the angle between the two dipole moments .",
    "thus , @xmath43 when the transition dipole moments are orthogonal to each other and  @xmath44 attains its maximal value of @xmath45 when the dipole moments are parallel or anti - parallel to each other .",
    "obviously , the sgc vanishes when @xmath43 and attains maximal value when  @xmath45 .",

    "since the transition @xmath52 is driven by a strong , nearly resonant laser field , it is convenient to work in the dressed - state picture  @xcite .",

    "applying the unitary transformation ( [ e9 ] ) , we find that the commutator part of the master equation for @xmath63 contains explicitly time dependent terms that oscillate at frequencies @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and the atomic dissipative part contains terms oscillating with @xmath64 and @xmath65 . in the limit of large rabi frequency @xmath66 , the oscillating terms in the dissipative part make contributions of order @xmath67 , where @xmath68 . these terms can be neglected in the secular approximation .",

    "( [ e23 ] ) that the parameter @xmath177 is different from zero only if the population is unequally distributed between the dressed states .",

    "in this case the parameter @xmath177 responsible for the nonlinear coupling between the modes is different from zero .",
