    "nonclassical states of the radiation fields , such as the number states , the coherent states and the phase states , play important roles in quantum optics and are extensively studied @xcite . the binomial states ( bs ) introduced by stoler _",
    "et al . _ in 1985 @xcite , interpolate between the _ most nonclassical _ number states and the _ most classical _ coherent states , and reduce to them in two different limits .",
    "some of their properties @xcite , methods of generation @xcite , as well as their interaction with atoms @xcite , have been investigated in the literature .",
    "the notion of bs was also generalised to the intermediate number - squeezed states @xcite and the number - phase states @xcite , the hypergeometric states @xcite , as well as their @xmath1-deformation @xcite .",
    "the photon number distribution of bs is the binomial distribution in the probability theory @xcite . in this letter",
    ", we shall introduce and study _ negative binomial states _ ( nbs )",
    "whose photon distribution is the _ negative binomial distribution _ ( nbd ) @xcite .",
    "different from the bs , the nbs are the _ intermediate phase - coherent states _ in the sense that they reduce to the susskind - glogower ( sg ) phase states @xcite and coherent states in two different limits ( sec.2 ) .",
    "we also derive their ladder and displacement operator formalisms and find that they are essentially the perelomov s @xmath0 coherent states via its holstein - primakoff ( hp ) realizations ( sec.3 ) . the nbs exhibit strong squeezing effects , but are not of sub - poissonian statistics ( sec.4 ) . a method to generate these nbs",
    "is proposed in sec.5 and a summary with special emphasis on the comparison with bs is given in sec.6 .",
    "we define the nbs as @xmath2 in which @xmath3 are the number states of the single - mode radiation field @xmath4=1,\\quad b\\|0\\rangle=0 ,     \\quad \\| n\\rangle={(b^\\dagger)^n\\over\\sqrt{n!}}\\|0\\rangle ,     \\label{bnum}\\ ] ] @xmath5 is a fixed positive integer , @xmath6 is the probability satisfying @xmath7 , and @xmath8 the @xmath9 is called the nbd @xcite since it can also be written as @xmath10 which has the similar form as the binomial distribution except for the two minuses and that @xmath11 runs to infinity . the states ( [ nbs ] ) are referred to as the nbs since their photon distribution @xmath12 is the nbd .",
    "the parameter @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) has clear physical meaning : it reflects the time development of the nbs .",
    "this can be seen from @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the hamiltonian of the single mode radiation field .    as a probability distribution @xmath9 satisfies @xcite @xmath17 which means that the nbs are normalized .",
    "let us consider two limiting cases :    ( 1 ) . in the limit @xmath18 , @xmath19 and thus the nbs go to the vacuum state .",
    "when @xmath18 , @xmath20 with fixed finite @xmath21 , the nbd goes to the poisson distribution @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the nbs degenerate to the ordinary coherent states .    we know that the bs degenerate to the number state in a certain limit @xcite .",
    "however the nbs do not maintain this feature .",
    "instead , the nbs tend to the sg phase states in a certain limit . to achieve this ,",
    "let us consider the case @xmath23 . in this case",
    ", @xmath24 is simplified as @xmath25 the photon distribution @xmath26 in this case is @xmath27 , the geometric distribution . for this reason we call @xmath28 the geometric states .",
    "one can easily verify that the geometric state @xmath28 is the eigenstate of the sg phase operator @xmath29 @xcite with the eigenvalue @xmath30 @xmath31 which is related to the annihilation operator @xmath32 through polar decomposition @xmath33 .",
    "now , multiplying a constant @xmath34 to @xmath28 and then taking the limit @xmath35 , we obtain the _ phase states _ @xmath36",
    "the @xmath37 states are non - normalisable , nonorthogonal , but resolve the identity @xmath38 the phase - state representation based on ( [ phstate ] ) is a useful calculational tool @xcite .    in this sense",
    ", we find that the nbs are the _ intermediate phase - coherent states_. this is an important feature of the nbs .",
    "let us recapitulate the displacement operator formalism of nbs @xcite using the _ identity method _ developed in a previous paper @xcite . to this end , let us rewrite nbs ( [ nbs ] ) ( @xmath39 ) @xmath40 then , by making use of the following identity @xmath41 we can write eq.([3366 ] ) in the exponential form @xmath42",
    "\\|0\\rangle , \\nonumber \\\\     & &    { \\cal k}_+=b^{\\dagger }     \\sqrt{m+n}\\equiv \\sqrt{m-1+n } b^{\\dagger}.   \\label{dis1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is interesting that @xmath43 along with @xmath44 generates the @xmath0 algebra via its hp realization with the bargmann index @xmath45 . by making use of the disentangling theorem of @xmath0",
    "algebra @xcite we arrive at the displacement operator formalism of nbs @xmath46     \\|0\\rangle,\\quad     \\zeta_c = e^{i\\theta}\\hbox{arctanh}\\,\\eta .",
    "\\label{dis2}\\ ] ] eq.([dis2 ] ) is nothing but the perelomov s coherent state of @xmath0 via its hp realisation .",
    "the perelomov s coherent states admit the ladder operator form @xcite . to see this , we differentiate both ( [ dis1 ] ) and ( [ dis2 ] ) with respect to @xmath47 and equate the results .",
    "we have @xmath48|\\eta e^{i\\theta } ; m\\rangle^-=     m\\eta |\\eta e^{i\\theta } ; m\\rangle^-.\\label{ladder}\\ ] ] this ladder operator form is obviously compatible with the limit results .",
    "in fact , in the limits @xmath18 and @xmath18 , @xmath49 with @xmath50 , eq.([ladder ] ) reduces to @xmath51 which mean @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the vacuum and coherent states respectively .",
    "finally we point out that the nbs can also be regarded as the _ density dependent annihilation operator _ coherent states , namely , @xmath54 when @xmath55 .",
    "the operator @xmath56 is not well - defined in the vacuum state .",
    "if we require @xmath57 then it is obvious that @xmath58 .",
    "this connection of sg phase operator with perelomov s coherent states with bargmann index @xmath59 was well - known .",
    "let us first examine if the nbs is of sub - poissonian statistics . using eq.([condition ] ) , it is easy to calculate the averages @xmath60 , @xmath61 and the fluctuation @xmath62 of the photon number @xmath63 then mandel s @xmath64-factor characterising sub - poissonian ( if @xmath65 ) distribution is obtained as @xmath66 so the field in nbs is _ super - poissonian _ , not sub - poissonian , except for the ( vacuum and coherent state ) limit @xmath18 ( @xmath67 , poissonian statistics ) .",
    "since the occurrence of antibunching and sub - poissonian are concomitant for single and time independent field , as in the present case , the field in nbs is bunching , not antibunching .",
    "in fact , from the following second - order correlation function @xmath68 @xmath69 we can arrive at the same conclusion .",
    "let us evaluate the variances @xmath70 and @xmath71 of the quadrature operators @xmath72 ( coordinate ) and @xmath73 ( momentum ) defined by @xmath74 from the following relation @xmath75 we have @xmath76 ^ 2 ,   \\label{555}\\\\     \\langle \\delta x^2\\rangle & = & \\frac{1}{2}+          \\frac{\\eta^2 m}{1-\\eta^2}+          \\frac{\\cos(2\\theta)\\eta^2(1-\\eta^2)^m}{(m-1 ) ! }          \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\eta^{2n } \\frac{(m+n-1)!}{n ! }          \\sqrt{(m+n+1)(m+n ) }                    \\nonumber \\\\ & &          -2\\cos^2\\theta\\ , \\eta^2   ( 1-\\eta^2)^{2 m } \\left [          \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\left(\\begin{array}{c } m+n-1\\\\n\\end{array }          \\right)\\eta^{2n } \\sqrt{m+n } \\right]^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the derivation of eq.([555 ] ) , we have used the identity @xmath77    let us analyse @xmath78 in more detail .",
    "first consider the case @xmath79 ( the initial time ) . in this case eq.([555 ] ) is simplified as @xmath80 since every term in the infinite series in eq.([delp ] ) is positive , the infinite sum is positive .",
    "so we always have @xmath81 .",
    "this means that the quadrature @xmath73 is squeezed .",
    "fig.1 shows how @xmath82 depends on @xmath83 and @xmath5 .",
    "we have chosen @xmath84 .",
    "those plots show that :    ( 1 ) .",
    "dependence on @xmath6 .",
    "it is found that the variance @xmath85 is an increasing function of @xmath6 , namely , the larger @xmath6 , the stronger the squeezing effect .",
    "note that @xmath86 since @xmath87 and @xmath88 is a positive definite hermitian operator .",
    "dependence on @xmath5 .",
    "we have chosen @xmath5=1 , 5 , 50 .",
    "the squeezing of @xmath73 for larger @xmath5 is stronger than that for small @xmath5 .",
    "when @xmath6 is small ( close to 0 ) or large ( close to 1 ) , the difference is very small . while when @xmath6 is around @xmath59 , the difference is larger .",
    "however , squeezing is not so sensitive to @xmath5 . the case @xmath89 and @xmath90 are almost same as showed in fig.1 .",
    "furthermore , due to the uncertainty relation @xmath91 , the variance @xmath92 when @xmath79 .",
    "so the quadrature @xmath72 is not squeezed .",
    "when @xmath93 , it is easy to see that @xmath94 is a @xmath95-periodic function with respect to @xmath13 and symmetric with respect to @xmath96 . to investigate the effect of @xmath13 to @xmath85 , we plot the @xmath85 as a function of @xmath13 for different @xmath6 values in fig.2 ( we choose @xmath23 for simplicity ) .",
    "we find that ( 1 ) @xmath85 becomes larger when @xmath13 creasing .",
    "it first reaches @xmath59 and then reaches the maximal value when @xmath96 .",
    "then it symmetrically decreases until @xmath97 .",
    "in some region around @xmath96 ( dependent on @xmath6 ) , the squeezing disappears .",
    "( 2 ) small @xmath6 violates the squeezing slightly while large @xmath6 destroys the squeezing strongly .",
    "the displacement operator formalism suggests that the nbs can be generated by the nondegenerate parameter amplifier described by the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 ( @xmath101 and @xmath102 ) are the annihilation operator and frequency for the signal ( idler ) mode .",
    "frequencies @xmath100 and @xmath102 sum to the pump frequency , @xmath103 .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath104 is proportional to the second - order susceptibility of the medium and to the amplitude of the pump .",
    "the unitary time evolution operator in the interaction picture is @xmath105 suppose that the system is initially prepared in the state @xmath106 . since the photons are created or annihilated in pairs , we can restrict ourselves in the subspace @xmath107 which is isomorphic to the single - mode fock space . then at any time @xmath108 the system is in @xmath109^{1\\over 2 }     e^{i2\\omega n}\\|n\\rangle.\\ ] ] identifying @xmath110 and @xmath111 , we obtain the nbs .",
    "in this letter we have introduced the negative binomial states and studied their nonclassical properties .",
    "the following table shows some properties of nbs with the special emphasis on the comparison with the binomial states :    [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we see that the nonclassical properties of the nbs and bs are complementary .    as further work we shall generalize the notations of nbs in this letter to the _ negative multinomial states _ with negative multinomial distribution as their photon distribution",
    "this generalisation concerns the multi - mode radiation field and should exhibit some more fruitful nonclassical properties like correlation between different modes .",
    "it is also a good challenges to study the interaction of radiation field in the nbs with the atoms .",
