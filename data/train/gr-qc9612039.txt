    "the usual meaning of `` testing a theory '' is rather negative : one compares its predictions with experimental data , and a single inconsistency suffices to rule it out . on the other hand , it is difficult to determine what features of the theory are correct when it passes a given test . in order to extract some positive information from experiment , it is useful to embed the theory into a class of alternatives .",
    "indeed , by contrasting their predictions , it is easier to understand in what way they differ , and to determine the common features which make them pass or not the available tests .",
    "moreover , this approach can suggest new experiments to test the other features of the theories .",
    "the best known example of such an embedding of general relativity into a space of alternatives is the so - called parametrized post - newtonian ( ppn ) formalism , which is extremely useful for studying gravity in weak - field conditions , at order @xmath0 with respect to the newtonian interaction .",
    "the original idea was formulated by eddington @xcite , who wrote the usual schwarzschild metric in isotropic coordinates , but introduced some phenomenological parameters @xmath1 , @xmath2 , in front of the different powers of the dimensionless ratio @xmath3  :    [ eq1 ] @xmath4\\ .",

    "in particular , will and nordtvedt @xcite introduced up to 8 extra parameters ( besides @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) , each of them describing a particular violation of the symmetries of general relativity , like local lorentz invariance , or the conservation of energy and momentum . since these 8 parameters do not have any really natural field - theoretic motivation ( as opposed to @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    "; see below ) , we will not consider them any longer in this paper .",
    "let us just mention that they are even more constrained than @xmath12 and @xmath13 by solar - system experiments .",

    "[ fig1 ] and a very thin 8-dimensional slice parallel to the plane of this figure .",
    "one can therefore conclude that general relativity is essentially the only theory which passes all these tests , and one may naturally ask the question : is it worth testing it any further  ?",
    "the reason why solar - system tests do not suffice is the extreme weakness of the gravitational field in these conditions .",
    "indeed , the largest deviation from the flat metric is found at the surface of the sun , and is proportional to its gravitational binding energy @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 denotes the radius of the considered body ) . in the vicinity of the earth ,",
    "the gravitational field is of order @xmath16 .",
    "this explains why only the first terms of the expansion ( [ eq1 ] ) are tested by solar - system experiments .",
    "two theories which are extremely close in weak - field conditions can differ significantly in the strong - field regime .",
    "for instance , the typical self - energy of a neutron star is @xmath17 , and therefore one can not justify any more the ppn truncation of the theory at order @xmath0 .",
    "[ a more rigorous definition of the binding energy is @xmath18 .",
    "this expression takes its maximum value , @xmath19 , for black holes .",
    "the value @xmath20 found for neutron stars should therefore be understood as a rather _ large _ number . ]",
    "binary pulsars are thus ideal tools for testing relativistic theories of gravity in strong - field conditions .    before embedding general relativity into a class of contrasting alternatives , and comparing their predictions with experimental data ,",
    "let us first describe the four main binary - pulsar tests presently available .",
    "the aim of this talk is not to explain what is a pulsar to specialists of the question . for our purpose , it is sufficient to note that an isolated pulsar is essentially a ( very stable ) clock . a binary pulsar ( a pulsar and a companion orbiting around each other ) is thus a _ moving clock _ , the best tool that one could dream of to test a relativistic theory .",
    "indeed , the frequency of the pulses is modified by the motion of the pulsar ( doppler effect ) , and one can extract from the table of arrivals many information concerning the orbit .",
    "for instance , the orbital period @xmath21 can be obtained from the time between two maxima of the pulse frequency .",
    "one can also measure several other keplerian parameters , like the eccentricity @xmath22 of the orbit , the angular position @xmath23 of the periastron , etc .    in the case of psr b 1913 + 16 , which has been continuously observed since its discovery in 1974 @xcite ,",
    "the data are so precise that one can even measure three relativistic effects with great accuracy .",
    "( i )  the redshift due to the companion denotes the pulsar , @xmath24 the companion , and @xmath25 the distance between them . ] @xmath26 and the second - order doppler effect @xmath27 are combined in an observable which has been denoted @xmath28 .

    "the three `` post - keplerian '' observables @xmath34 , @xmath29 , @xmath31 can thus be compared with the predictions of a given theory , which depend on the unknown masses @xmath35 , @xmath36 of the pulsar and its companion . however , 3 observables minus 2 unknown quantities is still 1 test .",
    "the equations @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , define three curves ( in fact three _ strips _ ) in the two - dimensional plane of the masses @xmath40 .",
    "if the three strips meet in a small region , there exists a pair of masses @xmath40 which is consistent with all three observables , and therefore the theory is consistent with the binary - pulsar data .",
    "if they do not meet , the theory is ruled out .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] displays these strips in the case of general relativity , which passes the test with flying colors .",
    "[ we will see below that some other theories can also pass this test . ]    the binary pulsar psr b 1534 + 12 has been observed only since 1991 @xcite but it is much closer to the earth than psr b 1913 + 16 , and three post - keplerian observables have already been measured with good precision : @xmath34 , @xmath41 , and a new parameter denoted @xmath42 .",
    "it is involved in the shape of the shapiro time delay ( an effect @xmath43 due to the propagation of light in the curved spacetime around the companion ) , and it can be interpreted as the sine @xmath44 of the angle between the orbit and the plane of the sky . [",
    "the range @xmath45 of this shapiro time delay is also measured but with less precision . ] here again , the three strips `` @xmath46 observed values '' can be plotted for a given theory , and if they meet each other , the test is passed .",

    "white dwarf binary psr b 0655 + 64 , happen to have very small observed values of @xmath31 , consistent with general relativity but not with a typical dipolar radiation .",
    "this is the third binary - pulsar test that we will use to constrain the space of gravity theories .",
    "we will also see in sec .",
    "3 below that in generic theories of gravity , the acceleration of a neutron star towards the center of the galaxy is not the same as the acceleration of a white dwarf .",
    "this violation of the strong equivalence principle causes a `` gravitational stark effect '' on the orbit of a neutron star ",
    "white dwarf system : its periastron is polarized towards the center of the galaxy .",
    "[ this is similar to the effects discussed in j.  bell s contribution to the present proceedings . ]",
    "more precisely , the eccentricity vector @xmath48 of the orbit is the sum of a fixed vector @xmath49 directed towards the galaxy center ( proportional to the difference of the accelerations of the bodies ) , and of a rotating vector @xmath50 corresponding to the usual periastron advance at angular velocity @xmath51 .",
    "several dissymmetrical systems of this kind ( such as psrs 1855 + 09 , 1953 + 29 , 1800@xmath5227 ) happen to have a very small eccentricity .",
    "the only explanation would be that the rotating vector @xmath50 is precisely canceling the fixed contribution @xmath49 at the time of our observation : @xmath53 .",
    "however , this is very improbable , and one can use a statistical argument to constrain the space of theories @xcite . moreover , by considering several such systems , the probability that they have simultaneously a small eccentricity is the product of the already small individual probabilities .",
    "this idea has been used in @xcite to derive a very tight bound on the difference of the accelerations of the bodies .",
    "this is the fourth binary - pulsar test that we will use in the following .",
    "of course , general relativity passes this test , since it does satisfy the strong equivalence principle ( universality of free fall of self - gravitating objects ) .",
    "these four tests are presently the most precise of all those which are available .",
    "it should be noted that many other tests are _ a priori _ possible : damour and taylor @xcite have shown that 15 tests are in principle possible for each binary pulsar , if the pulses are measured precisely enough .",
    "we saw in the previous section that several tests of gravity can be performed in the strong - field regime , and that general relativity passes all of them . as discussed in sec .  1",
    ", our aim is now to embed einstein s theory into a class of alternatives , in order to determine what features have been tested , and what can be further tested .",
    "a generalization of the ppn formalism to all orders in @xmath54 would need an infinite number of parameters [ cf .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) ] .",
    "we will instead focus on the most natural class of alternatives to general relativity : `` tensor - scalar '' theories , in which gravity is mediated by a tensor field ( @xmath55 ) and one or several scalar fields ( @xmath56 ) . here",

    "general relativity corresponds to a vanishing function @xmath71 , and jordan - fierz - brans - dicke theory to a linear function @xmath72 .",

    "before studying the behavior of these theories in strong - field conditions , it is necessary to take into account the solar - system constraints ( [ eq2 ] ) . a simple diagrammatic argument @xcite allows us to derive the expressions of the effective gravitational constant between two bodies , and of the eddington ppn parameters in tensor - scalar theories :    [ eq5 ] @xmath74    [ the factor @xmath75 comes from the exchange of a scalar particle between two bodies , whereas @xmath76 comes from a scalar exchange between three bodies .",

    "in particular , it does not tell us if @xmath69 is positive [ @xmath62 convex ] or negative [ @xmath62 concave ] .",
