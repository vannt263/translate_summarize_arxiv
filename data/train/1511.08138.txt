    "a bilinear system not only induces a system on projective space , but also on grassmannians and flag manifolds .",
    "another way to describe these systems is by looking at a right - invariant system on the lie group @xmath125 or @xmath126 ( if @xmath127 for @xmath128 ) given by@xmath129 where @xmath130 , and viewing the flag manifolds as homogeneous spaces of this group .",

    "chain control sets are characterized via the so - called flag type of the control flow .",
    "we do not go into further details here , because this would necessitate to introduce plenty of lie - theoretic notions .",
    "we note that also in the classical uniformly hyperbolic theory the simplest examples are given by algebraic systems , namely by linear automorphisms of the @xmath93-dimensional torus , which are anosov diffeomorphisms , i.e. , diffeomorphisms that admit a hyperbolic structure on the whole state space , cf .",
    "a very useful property of uniformly hyperbolic systems is the shadowing property . roughly speaking",

    "in fact , a chain control set may contain several control sets that have positive distance to each other .",
    "this result has the remarkable consequence that compact uniformly hyperbolic chain control sets change continuously in the hausdorff metric with respect to parameters of the systems .",

    "theorem [ thm_robustness1 ] corresponds to well - known robustness results in the uniformly hyperbolic theory of smooth dynamical systems ( e.g. , structural stability of axiom a systems ) .",

    "the corresponding bit rate for this control strategy is given by the sum of the unstable eigenvalues of the monodromy operator associated with the periodic orbit ( divided by the period ) .",
    "this survey on uniformly hyperbolic control theory would not be complete without some remarks about the subjects known by the names ` control of chaos ' and ` partial control ( of chaos ) ' , which also use ideas from the hyperbolic theory of dynamical systems .",
    "the idea of the first is to produce desired controlled trajectories with low energy use by fixing an unstable periodic orbit inside a chaotic ( possibly hyperbolic ) attractor of an uncontrolled dynamical system and stabilizing this orbit via very small time - dependent perturbations of a system parameter , applied once in a while .",
    "this method ( which essentially exists in two variants , called the _ ogy method _ @xcite and the _ pyragas method _",
    "@xcite ) has proven to be extremely useful and effective .",
    "its main advantage is that it does not require a detailed model of the chaotic attractor , but only some information about a poincar section , which is used to determine the periodic orbit . since a typical trajectory in a neighborhood of the chaotic attractor will come close to any periodic orbit , one can just wait until the system runs into a small enough neighborhood of the fixed trajectory and then apply the control algorithm .",
    "experimental applications of control of chaos include turbulent fluids , oscillating chemical reactions , magneto - mechanical oscillators , and cardiac tissues .",
    "while the idea of controlling chaos was first introduced in the 1990 paper @xcite , the idea of ` partial control ' is relatively new , cf .",
    "here one fixes a non - attracting hyperbolic invariant set of an uncontrolled equation and adds both noise and control terms to the equation . using horseshoe structures , it is possible to show the existence of a non - trivial ` safe region ' around the hyperbolic set which is controlled invariant in the sense that whenever the initial condition lies in this region , no matter what the disturbance is , one can always choose a control that keeps the system in the safe region for the next time step .",
    "the safe region , in general , has a complicated geometric structure , although it is not a fractal set .",
    "the main novelty in this approach is that the absolute value of the control can be chosen strictly smaller than the maximal possible disturbance .",
    "the name ` partial control ' comes from the fact that the method does not allow to follow any particular trajectory , but only guarantees that the system stays close to the chaotic set . while the theory described in sections [ sec_csets][sec_ie ] is rather concerned with the general analysis of control systems , the ideas described in this section aim at concrete control algorithms to be practically implemented , even without knowing the exact equations governing the system .",
    "the results described in this paper mainly deal with continuous - time systems and the simpler type of uniform hyperbolicity without center bundle .",
    "it is desirable to extend the results to the discrete - time case and uniformly hyperbolic chain control sets with center bundle .",
    "particular difficulties will arise in extending the result about invariance entropy , because its proof is heavily based on the structural result of theorem [ thm_str ] , which does no longer hold in the case with center bundle .",
    "furthermore , the proof of theorem [ thm_ie ] requires an elaborate result of coron @xcite on the genericity of universally regular control functions in smooth systems , an analogue of which does not seem to be available in the discrete - time case . another possible future direction concerns the extension of the controllability and robustness result described in section [ sec_contr_rob ] to the partially hyperbolic case , when a center bundle of dimension @xmath208 is present .",
    "examples for this behavior can be derived from the construction described in section [ sec_ae ] , or the more general lie - theoretic construction in @xcite . in the uncontrolled case ,",
    "the theory of partial hyperbolicity ( see @xcite ) is quite well - developed so that one can hope to transfer methods of this theory to the control - affine case and obtain some results about the controllability structure inside a partially hyperbolic chain control set .",

    "<S> this paper gives a summary of a body of work at the intersection of control theory and smooth nonlinear dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the main idea is to transfer the concept of uniform hyperbolicity , central to the theory of smooth dynamical systems , to control - affine systems . combining the strength of geometric control theory and the hyperbolic theory of dynamical systems , it is possible to deduce control - theoretic results of non - local nature that reveal remarkable analogies to the classical hyperbolic theory of dynamical systems . </S>",
    "<S> this includes , in particular , results in networked control involving communication channels of finite capacity . </S>"
