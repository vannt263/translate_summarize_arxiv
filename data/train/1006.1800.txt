    "plasmon excitations in carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) continue to attract attention for a variety of applications , e.g. , in the context of their optical response @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "plasmon excitations are most effectively probed by fast - moving charged particles , such as in electron energy loss spectroscopy ( eels ) using a scanning transmission electron microscope ( stem ) .",
    "this technique has proven to be a powerful tool for investigating the dynamic response of cnts @xcite and , more recently , graphene @xcite . moreover , plasmon excitations were observed to play an important role in electronic excitations of cnts exposed to ion bombardment @xcite . on the theoretical side , in addition to _ ab initio _",
    "calculations @xcite , simpler models have been also used to study plasmon excitations in carbon nano - structures , such as the empirical dielectric tensor @xcite and the hydrodynamic model @xcite .    since carbon nano - structures present physical realizations of one - atom thick layers of an electron gas , it is no surprise that a two - dimensional ( 2d ) version of the hydrodynamic model was used early on in studying plasmon excitation in cnts @xcite .",
    "we note that a planar 2d hydrodynamic model of the electron gas was pioneered by fetter @xcite in 1973 .",
    "this model has subsequently been used to gain qualitative understanding of plasmon excitations in various quasi-2d electronic structures , including semiconductor inversion layers , quantum wells , and thin metallic films .",
    "such a model assumes that all electrons belong to a single fluid characterized by two parameters only , the equilibrium surface density @xmath2 and the effective electron mass @xmath3 . owing to its simplicity and versatility in handling difficult geometric constraints , multilayered structures , and the presence of dielectric environment ,",
    "the single - fluid version of the 2d hydrodynamic model has been used in a significant number of applications of cnts and fullerene molecules @xcite .    however , treating the four valence electrons per atom in carbon nano - structures as belonging to the same fluid fails to capture significant differences in their bonding .",
    "three of these valence electrons are involved in the strong @xmath0 bonds characterizing the @xmath4 hybridization within a layer of carbon atoms . at the same time , one electron occupies a weakly bound @xmath1 orbital that is largely responsible for the conductivity properties of carbon nano - structures . while the @xmath1 electron bands make graphene a zero - gap semiconductor , the so - called graphene nano - ribbons ( gnrs ) , as well as cnts may exhibit metallic or semiconducting character depending on the symmetry of their underlying atomic structure . on the other hand , the @xmath0",
    "electron bands exhibit a large gap that gives rise to a characteristic high - frequency feature in the absorption spectra in various allotropic forms of carbon .",
    "consequently , inspired by the empirical model of cazaux @xcite , barton and eberlein @xcite proposed a two - fluid version of the 2d hydrodynamic model .",
    "their model treats the @xmath0 and @xmath1 electrons as two classical fluids with equilibrium densities @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 nm@xmath8 is graphene s atomic density ) , respectively , which they superimposed on the surface of a c@xmath9 molecule . by introducing an empirical restoring frequency for the @xmath0 electron fluid , the two - fluid 2d hydrodynamic model of barton and eberlein",
    "was shown to give rise to two groups of plasmons .",
    "this explained well the two dominant absorption features in the frequency ranges of 5 - 10 ev and 15 - 30 ev , in both fullerene molecules @xcite and single - wall cnts ( swcnts ) @xcite .    on the other hand , mowbray _",
    "introduced the quantum , or fermi pressure in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 electron fluids , and reformulated the two - fluid 2d hydrodynamic model without invoking any empirical parameters @xcite .",
    "they found that the electrostatic interaction between the fluids gives rise to two groups of high- and low - frequency plasmons for both swcnts @xcite and multi - wall cnts ( mwcnts ) @xcite in similar ranges as those obtained by barton and eberlein @xcite .",
    "versatility of this version of the two - fluid 2d hydrodynamic model was further exploited in studying the interactions of cnts with dielectric media @xcite , as well as in applications to the propagation of electromagnetic radiation through cnts @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we perform a second quantization of the two - fluid 2d hydrodynamic model for electron gas confined on the surface of an infinitely long cylinder representing a free swcnt , and use it to analyze the spectra of plasmon excitations induced by a classical non - relativistic charged particle , passing by the nanotube under an arbitrary angle of incidence .",
    "this approach enables us to study the effects of multiple plasmon excitations by external particle beams , similar to the eels studies of thin metallic films on solid surfaces @xcite .",
    "such a study can help elucidate which plasmon modes are most effectively excited depending on the incident projectile trajectory . besides obvious applications in the eels studies of cnts , the results of this work may help to understand the role of electronic channels in energy deposition in carbon nano - structures during ion irradiation @xcite .    after describing the model and outlining its second quantization in section [ ii ] , we shall discuss our results for the plasmon excitation spectra , total energy loss , and the stopping force on the external charge in section [ iii ] .",
    "our concluding remarks will be followed by a description of the statistical properties of plasmon excitations in appendix [ app : a ] , a discussion of the relation to the semi - classical model in appendix [ app : b ] , and an outline of how the results for planar 2d electron gas may be obtained from the formalism for cylindrical geometry in appendix [ app : c ] .",
    "we shall use the gaussian electrostatic units unless otherwise indicated .",

    "( [ h ] ) may be interpreted as the kinetic energy of a classical fluid @xmath21 moving at the velocity @xmath23 , where the dot stands for time derivative .",
    "the second term represents the restoring ( r ) effects on the fluid displacement due to electron binding in harmonic approximation , giving rise to restoring frequency @xmath24 .",
    "further , the potential energy per electron , @xmath25 , consists of the ground state energy due to the positive - ion background , @xmath26 , and the energy due to the time - dependent external perturbing potential , @xmath27 .",
    "the next two terms represent , respectively , the thomas - fermi ( tf ) and the dirac s ( d ) exchange interactions in the local - density approximation for the electron fluid @xmath21 , whereas the last term in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) represents coulomb interactions among electrons .    a few additional comments on the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) may be in order . while restoring frequencies @xmath28 play the role of empirical parameters that are usually determined by fitting to experimental data @xcite ,",
    "their physical motivation is to take into account the effects of the electronic band structure of carbon nano - structures in a manner analogous to that invoked in devising the drude - lorentz dielectric function for carbon materials @xcite .",
    "so , invoking the high mobility of the @xmath1 electrons in metallic nanotubes and considering that the @xmath0 electron bands exhibit a gap of about 12 ev , we adopt the restoring frequencies of @xmath29 ev and @xmath30 ev , which have been used by previous authors @xcite .",
    "next , we note that the tf and d terms are written in the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) in a form commensurate with a _ planar",
    "_ 2d electron gas .",
    "this may be justified by considering a quasi - free 2d electron gas with the number density per unit area @xmath31 , occupying the surface of a cylinder with radius @xmath13 , where curvature effects were found negligible when @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the fermi wavenumber of the corresponding planar 2d electron gas @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that a hamiltonian , which is similar in form to the one in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) , was used by van zyl and zaremba @xcite who included the so - called von weizscker , or gradient - correction term of the form @xmath34 this provides an approximate correction for the non - local effects in the tf interaction in a planar 2d electron gas . however , there is considerable uncertainty regarding the exact form of such a term .",
    "in fact , it was confirmed recently that the von weizscker factor @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( [ vw ] ) should vanish in a strict planar case @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it has become quite common to use the von weizscker correction with @xmath36 in many recent studies of cnts @xcite , even though the effects of curvature on this term are not known at present .",
    "fortunately , the von weizscker correction was found to only affect plasmon dispersion at very short wavelengths @xcite .",
    "such wavelengths are comparable to the inter - atomic spacing where the hydrodynamic model is likely to break down anyway , so we shall neglect such a contribution to the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) .",
    "we further assume that the interaction with the external particle can be considered as a small perturbation .",
    "hence , we can expand the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) to the second order with respect to the perturbation by declaring @xmath37 and writing @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the ground - state electron density in the @xmath21th fluid .",
    "we can further express the perturbed electron density in terms of the displacement field in a manner that will automatically satisfy the linearized continuity equation by writing @xmath41 . here",
    "the gradient @xmath42 differentiates only in the directions tangential to the surface of the cylinder @xmath43 .",
    "moreover , by restricting consideration to electrostatic phenomena , the velocity field will be irrotational .",
    "this will be ensured by defining a potential function for the displacement field , @xmath44 , such that @xmath45 .",
    "we can now write the second - order hamiltonian in terms of the function @xmath44 alone ,    @xmath46    before proceeding , it is worth mentioning that , while quantum treatment generally requires a second - order hamiltonian @xcite , as in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) , such an approximation for the hamiltonian yields semi - classical equations of motion for the electron gas that correspond to the linearized hydrodynamic model . to illustrate this point",

    "it is interesting to note that the effect of the dirac term in eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) is to reduce the adiabatic limit of the speed due to the tf term , which can be written as @xmath54 with @xmath55 being the fermi speed for the @xmath21-th fluid in equilibrium .",
    "it can be shown that , in a hydrodynamic model without the dirac correction @xcite , the high - frequency expression for the speed due to the tf interaction should be corrected so that @xmath56 @xcite . however , including this effect in the present model would require using a relaxation approximation for the kinetics of the electron gas , rendering second quantization of the model unsuitable @xcite .",
    "we make further progress by seeking a fourier series representation of the potential function @xmath57 for its dependence on coordinates on the nanotube s surface .",
    "this will give rise to a change in variables @xmath58 for all quantities of interest , with @xmath59 and @xmath60 defining the modes of plasmon propagation around the nanotube s circumference and in its axial direction , respectively .",
    "we initially assume that the nanotube has a finite length @xmath61 , so that its total area is @xmath62 and @xmath60 is a discrete variable , taking values @xmath63 with @xmath64 being an integer .",

    "we note that , while the present formalism is most clearly developed by using summation over @xmath60 for a nanotube of finite length , our final results will be computed by integration over @xmath60 , corresponding to the limit of an infinitely long nanotube . in this way we neglect any end effects on plasmon excitation spectra , which may be justified by invoking a typically high aspect ratio for cnts , @xmath68",

    "<S> we present a quantization of the hydrodynamic model to describe the excitation of plasmons in a single - walled carbon nanotube by a fast point charge moving near its surface at an arbitrary angle of incidence . using a two - dimensional electron gas represented by two interacting fluids , which takes into account the different nature of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 electrons , we obtain plasmon energies in near - quantitative agreement with experiment . </S>",
    "<S> further , the implemented quantization procedure allows us to study the probability of exciting various plasmon modes , as well as the stopping force and energy loss spectra of the incident particle . </S>"
