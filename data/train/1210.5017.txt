    "this is a strong - coupling approach , and is in sharp contrast to a weak - coupling description that invokes nesting of hole and electron fermi surface pockets to drive both the spin fluctuations and superconductivity .",

    "[ summary ] includes some summary remarks .    -0.2pc",
    "the strong - coupling approach has its roots in a number of experimental observations .",
    "one is the fact that the room temperature resistivity is so high ( @xmath8 m@xmath9-cm ) that the mean free path is only of order the fermi wavelength , as is typical for bad metals near a mott transition .",
    "because this is the case even in compounds that are quite pure as inferred from their small residual resistivity , it signifies the existence of strong inelastic scatterings that are attributable to the sizable electron - electron interactions @xcite .",
    "this arises if the metallic parent iron pnictides are close to a mott transition , when only a small portion of the single - electron excitation spectrum lies in the coherent low - energy part , of weight @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "this bad - metal interpretation has been confirmed by optical conductivity measurements @xcite . as illustrated in fig .  2",
    ", the experimentally measured spectral weight for the drude peak normalized by the non - interacting value extracted from band - structure calculations , @xmath10 , provides a measure of the correlation strength : it would be close to @xmath11 for weakly interacting systems , and close to @xmath12 for mott insulators .",
    "the experimentally determined value @xcite is close to about @xmath13 , falling into the regime of bad metals in proximity to mott localization .",
    "this implies that a large portion of the single - electron spectral weight lies in the incoherent part , which would be associated with the large coulomb ( direct plus hund s ) interaction energy scale .",
    "at the same time , this reduction of drude weight is accompanied by the transfer of optical spectral weight between low and high frequencies .",
    "* spin spectral weight for several iron arsenides . * adapted with permission from ref .  @xcite . ]    the spin dynamics , as revealed in inelastic neutron scattering experiments @xcite , also gives strong support to the picture of interacting local moments , whose sizeable spectral weight arises from the _ incoherent _ part ( weight @xmath14 ) of the electronic excitation spectrum .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "3 , adapted from liu et al @xcite , where the spin spectral distribution is shown over a range of energies which includes spin waves throughout the brillouin zone .",
    "the integrated spectral weight is very large ( @xmath15 per fe ) , consistent with local moments of spin @xmath16 1 .",
    "such a large spectral weight readily arises from the incoherent part of the single - electron spectral weight , as dmft calculations have shown  @xcite , but is very difficult to obtain from the single - electron excitations in the vicinity of the small fermi pockets in the weak - coupling approaches .",
    "indeed , an rpa calculation fails to represent the data @xcite .",
    "the observation of the mott insulating behavior in the iron oxychalcogenides @xcite and vacancy - ordered alkaline iron selenides @xcite has provided further evidence for the strong electron correlations .",
    "these materials should be metallic according to the lda bandstructure calculations in the paramagnetic state ( even in the presence of the ordered vacancies in the alkaline iron pnictides ) , but are observed to be insulating with a very large ordered moment . as discussed in secs .",
    "[ mott_oxyselenides ] and [ kfese ] , the mott insulating nature of these materials - as opposed to the metallic behavior of the parent iron pnictides - can be understood in terms of a reduced bandwidth but a comparable strength of the coulomb interaction ( along with the hund s coupling ) . since the reduction of the lda bandwidth is rather modest , the observed mott insulating behavior provides evidence for the strong electron correlations in the iron pnictides as well .",
    "more generally , the evolution in the degree of itinerancy across the various materials families in the iron - based materials can be understood in a picture in which the strength of the local interactions ( @xmath17 ) is fixed but the kinetic energy(@xmath18 ) is variable , as can be seen through calculations of multi - orbital models @xcite and _ ab initio _ lda+dmft studies @xcite .",
    "* density of states ( dos ) of a two - orbital model derived in a slave - spin study . *",

    "have been shifted upward for clarity . adapted from ref .",
    "for bad metals near a mott transition , the incoherent electronic excitations play a dominant role in the spin dynamics .",
    "this effect is difficult to describe in a direct expansion of @xmath6 , with respect to the non - interacting reference point .",
    "it can instead be more readily captured by an expansion with respect to the mott transition point , with @xmath21 being the small parameter . in practice , this is equivalent to expanding in terms of @xmath0 , the percentage of the single - electron spectral weight in the coherent part @xcite .",
    "when @xmath22 , at the mott transition , we can integrate out all the gapped single - electron excitations .",

    "the ground state of the @xmath26 heisenberg model on the square lattice is expected to have the collinear @xmath27 antiferromagnetic order @xcite , as is observed experimentally in the iron pnictides .",
    "furthermore , the antiferromagnetic order in this model is accompanied by an ising order , whose linear coupling to structural degrees of freedom induces a structural distortion which is also seen experimentally in the pnictides .",
    "because the charge gap is relatively small , we may also expect significant higher - spin couplings .",
    "of particular interest is the four - spin biquadratic interaction @xmath28 , whose effect we will discuss in sec .",

    "the final form for the low - energy effective hamiltonian is @xmath36",
    "an important consequence of the strong - coupling approach is that by tuning the strong - coupling parameter @xmath0 , one can access a qcp , separating a paramagnetic metallic phase from an antiferromagnetic or possibly insulating phase .",
    "indeed , it was predicted @xcite and subsequently experimentally confirmed that doping phosphorus into a magnetic fe - as parent compound would reveal a magnetic quantum critical point , as shown in fig .",
    "the reason is that , since p is smaller than as , the lattice contracts a bit upon p doping , with a consequence that the kinetic energy ( bandwidth ) increases so that @xmath0 increases to a critical value @xmath37 at which the magnetism disappears .",

    "an important ingredient of the analysis given in ref .",
    "@xcite is that the quartic coupling , @xmath55 , is only marginally relevant with respect to the underlying fixed point associated with the o(3 ) transition of @xmath41 ( and @xmath42 ) .",

    "quantum criticality represents one way to study the quantum fluctuations , through the tuning of a control parameter .",
    "alternatively , these fluctuations can be directly probed by studying the frequency and wave - vector dependences of the spin structure factor . a particularly instructive case to consider is the parent arsenides in their paramagnetic phases , at @xmath57 @xcite ;",
    "the absence of order fascilitates the study of the underlying interactions . with that in mind , we have studied the @xmath58 model :    @xmath59    which is combined with the damping term specified in eq .  [ damping ] .",
