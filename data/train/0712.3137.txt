    "computer science and physics , although different disciplines in essence , have been closely linked since the birth of the first one . more recently",
    ", computer science has met together with statistical physics in the so called combinatorial problems and their relation to phase transitions and computational complexity ( see @xcite for a compendium of recent works ) .",
    "more accurately , algorithmic phase transitions ( threshold property in the computer science language ) , i.e. sharp changes in the behavior of some computer algorithms , have attracted the attention of both communities @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that phase transitions play an important role in the resource growing classification of random combinatorial problems @xcite .",
    "the computational complexity theory is therefore nowadays experimenting a widespread growth , melting different ideas and approaches coming either from theoretical computation , discrete mathematics , and physics .",
    "for instance , there exist striking similarities between optimization problems and the study of the ground states of disordered models @xcite .",
    "+ problems related to random combinatorics appear typically in discrete mathematics ( graph theory ) , computer science ( search algorithms ) or physics ( disordered systems ) .",
    "the concept of sudden change in the behavior of some variables of the system is intimately linked to this hallmark .",
    "for instance , erd@xmath0s and renyi , in their pioneering work on graph theory @xcite , found the existence of _ zero - one _ laws in their study of cluster generation .",
    "these laws have a clear interpretation in terms of phase transitions , which appear extensively in many physical systems .",
    "more recently , computer science community has detected this behavior in the context of algorithmic problems .",
    "the so called _ threshold phenomenon _",
    "@xcite distinguishes zones in the phase space of an algorithm where the problem is , computationally speaking , either tractable or intractable .",
    "it is straightforward that these three phenomena can be understood as a unique concept , in such a way that building bridges between each other is an appealing idea .",
    "+ related to the concept of a phase transition is the task of classifying combinatorial problems .",
    "the theory of computational complexity distinguishes problems which are tractable , that is to say , solvable in polynomial time by an efficient algorithm , from those which are not .",
    "the so - called @xmath1 class gathers problems that can be solved in polynomial time by a non - deterministic turing machine @xcite .",
    "this class generally includes many hard or eventually intractable problems , although this classification is denoted _ worst - case _ , that is to say , a rather pessimistic one , since the situations that involve long computations can be eventually rare . in the last years , numerical evidences suggest the presence of the threshold phenomenon in @xmath1 problems .",
    "these phase transitions may in turn characterize the _ average - case _ complexity of the associated problems , as pointed out recently @xcite .",
    "+   + in this paper we discuss a stochastic algorithm inspired on artificial chemistry models @xcite that has already been studied from a statistical physics point of view @xcite .",
    "this algorithm generates prime numbers by means of a stochastic integer decomposition .",
    "a continuous phase transition has been detected and described in a previous work @xcite : we can distinguish a stationary phase where the ability for producing primes is practically null and a stationary phase where the algorithm is able to reduce the whole system into primes .",
    "it is straightforward to reinterpret the model as a search problem @xcite which undergoes an algorithmic phase transition related to a change in its computational complexity . in this paper",
    "we firstly pretend to make a broader characterization of the system ; in this sense this work is a continuation of a previous one @xcite .",
    "further on , we will situate the model in the context of the computational complexity theory , in order to relate its computational complexity with the phase transition present in the system . the paper",
    "thus goes as follows : in section ii we will describe the model , which stands as a stochastic prime number generator . in section iii",
    "we will characterize the phase transition present in the system , following the steps depicted in a previous work @xcite and providing some new data and additional information . concretely",
    ", we will firstly outline the breaking of symmetry responsible for the order - disorder transition . after defining proper order and control parameters",
    ", critical exponents will be calculated numerically from extensive simulations and finite size scaling analysis .",
    "an analytical approach to the system will also be considered at this point , in terms of an annealed approximation . in section iv",
    ", we will reinterpret the model as a search problem .",
    "we will then show that the system belongs to the @xmath1 class in a worst - case classification .",
    "we will find an easy - hard - easy pattern in the algorithm , as common in many @xmath1 problems , related in turn to the critical slowing down near the the transition point . according to @xcite",
    ", we will finally relate the nature of the phase transition with the average - case complexity of the problem .",
    "we will show that while the problem is in @xmath1 , the resource growing is only polynomial . in section v we will conclude .",
    "the fundamental theorem of arithmetic @xcite states that every integer greater than one can be expressed uniquely as a product of primes or powers of primes . in a certain manner ,",
    "prime numbers act as atoms in chemistry , both are irreducible . this way , composite numbers can be understood as molecules .",
    "following this resemblance , the next algorithm has been introduced @xcite : suppose that we got a pool of positive integers @xmath2 , from which we randomly extract a certain number @xmath3 of them ( this will constitute the system under study ) .",
    "note that the chosen numbers can be repeated , and that the integer @xmath4 is not taken into account .",
    "now , given two numbers @xmath5 and @xmath6 taken from the system of @xmath3 numbers , the algorithm collision rules are the following :    * rule 1 : if @xmath7 there is no reaction ( elastic shock ) , and the numbers are not modified .",
    "* rule 2 : if the numbers are different ( say @xmath8 ) , a reaction will take place only if @xmath6 is a divisor of @xmath5 , i.e. if @xmath5 mod @xmath9 .",
    "the reaction will then stand for @xmath10 where @xmath11 stands for the usual notation of a chemical reaction and @xmath12 .",
    "* rule 3 : if @xmath8 but @xmath5 mod @xmath13 , no reaction takes place ( elastic shock ) .",
    "the result of a reaction will be the extinction of the composed number @xmath5 and the introduction of a simpler one , @xmath14 .",
    "+ the algorithm goes as follows : after randomly extracting from the pool @xmath2 a set of @xmath3 numbers , we pick at random two numbers @xmath5 and @xmath6 from the set : this is equivalent to the random encounter of two molecules .",
    "we then apply the reaction rules . in order to have a parallel updating",
    ", we will establish @xmath3 repetitions of this process ( @xmath3 monte carlo steps ) as a time step .",
    "note that the reactions tend to separate numbers into its irreducible elements , as molecules can be separated into atoms .",
    "hence , this dynamic when iterated may generate prime numbers in the system .",
    "we say that the system has reached stationarity when every collision is elastic ( no more reaction can be achieved ) , whether because every number has become a prime or because rule 2 can not be satisfied in any case -frozen state- .",
    "the algorithm then stops .",
    "versus @xmath3 , for a pool size @xmath15 .",
    "each run is averaged over @xmath16 realizations in order to avoid fluctuations .",

    "we present the results of monte carlo simulations calculating , as a function of @xmath3 and for a concrete pool size @xmath15 , the steady values of @xmath17 . every simulation is averaged over @xmath16 realizations in order to avoid fluctuations .",

    ", every number has the same probability to appear in the steady state . in the other hand ,",
    "the average steady state distribution of the @xmath3 numbers in the phase of high @xmath17 is plotted in the right side of figure ( [ distris ] ) : the distribution is now a power law , which is related to a biased , inhomogeneous state . in this regime ,",
    "the probability of having -in the steady state- a composite number is practically null , and the probability of having the prime @xmath23 is in turn proportional to @xmath24 @xcite .     versus @xmath3 , for different pool sizes @xmath25 ( each simulation",
    "is averaged over @xmath16 realizations).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the breaking of this symmetry between steady distributions leads us to assume an order - disorder phase transition , the phase with small proportion of primes being the disordered phase and the ordered phase being the one where @xmath17 tends to one .",
    "+ a second feature worth investigating is the size dependence of the transition . in figure [ r2 ]",
    "we plot @xmath17 versus @xmath3 , for a set of different pool sizes @xmath25 .",
    "note that the qualitative behavior is size invariant , however the transition point increases with @xmath25 .",
    "this size dependence will be considered in a later section .",
    "+    , ( middle ) critical phase @xmath26 , ( bottom ) ordered phase @xmath27.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]     as a function of the time steps for the same configurations as for figure [ series].,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    as a third preliminary insight , we shall study the temporal evolution of the system . in figure",
    "[ series ] we plot , for a given pool size @xmath19 , the cumulated number of reactions that a system of @xmath3 numbers needs to make in order to reach stationarity . according to this , in figure [ concentraciones ]",
    "we plot , for the same @xmath28 , the evolving value @xmath29 . in the disordered phase",
    "we can see that the system is rapidly frozen : the algorithm is not efficient in producing primes , and @xmath17 is asymptotically small .",
    "in the ordered phase the system needs more time to reach stationarity : this is due to the fact that the algorithm is producing many primes , as the evolving value of @xmath17 reaches the unity .",
    "it is however in a neighborhood of the transition where the system takes the higher times to reach the steady state : the system is producing many reactions , but not that many primes .",
    "this fact can be related to a critical slowing down phenomenon , and is studied further in the text . + it is worth notting in figures [ r_y_v ] and [ r2 ] that in the disordered phase the order parameter does nt vanish , as it should .",
    "this is due to the fact that in a pool of @xmath25 numbers , following the prime number theorem , one finds on average @xmath30 primes @xcite .",
    "thus , there is always a residual contribution to the ratio @xmath31 not related to the system s dynamics which only becomes relevant for small values of @xmath3 , when the algorithm is not able to produce primes .",
    "this feature can be understood according to figures ( [ series ] , [ concentraciones ] ) , where in the disordered phase the system rapidly reaches a frozen state . note that the ratio in this case increases from @xmath32 -residual ratio- to an asymptotic value of @xmath33 .",
    "it is clear that the system in this phase is not able to produce primes , and that the residual ratio takes practically the whole contribution .",
    "+ since an order parameter should vanish in the disordered phase and be non - null in the ordered phase , a new order parameter that should avoid these problems has to be defined .",
    "the preliminary study suggests the presence of a phase transition that distinguishes a phase where the algorithm is able to reduce every element of the system into a prime from another where the system is frozen in a state of low prime concentration .",
    "it is straightforward that the algorithm searches stochastically the suitable combinations through which initial numbers can react and reduce into simpler ones .",
    "let us now see how this phase transition can be understood as a dynamical process embedded in a catalytic network having integer numbers as the nodes . consider two numbers of that network , say @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "these numbers are connected ( @xmath37 ) if they are exactly divisible , that is to say , if @xmath38 with c being an integer .",
    "the topology of similar networks has been studied in @xcite , concretely in @xcite it is shown that this network exhibits scale - free topology @xcite : the degree distribution is @xmath39 with @xmath40 . in our system , fixing @xmath3 is equivalent to selecting a random subset of nodes in this network . if @xmath34 and @xmath35 are selected they may react giving @xmath38 ; in terms of the network this means that the path between nodes @xmath34 and @xmath35 is travelled thanks to the catalytic presence of @xmath41 .",
    "we may say that our network is indeed a catalytic one @xcite where there are no cycles as attractors but two different stationary phases : ( i ) for large values of @xmath3 all resulting paths sink into primes numbers , and ( ii ) if @xmath3 is small only a few paths are travelled and no primes are reached .",
    "notice that in this network representation , primes are the only nodes that have input links but no output links ( by definition , a prime number is only divisible by the unit and by itself , acting as an absorbing node of the dynamics ) . when the temporal evolution of this algorithm is explored for small values of @xmath3 , we have observed in figures [ series],[concentraciones ] that the steady state is reached very fast . as a consequence ,",
    "there are only few travelled paths over the network and since @xmath3 is small the probability of catalysis is small as well , hence the paths ending in prime nodes are not travelled .",
    "we say in this case that the system freezes in a disordered state .",
    "in contrast when @xmath3 is large enough , many reactions take place and the network is travelled at large . under these circumstances ,",
    "an arbitrary node may be catalyzed by a large @xmath42 quantity of numbers , its probability of reaction being high .",
    "thus , in average all numbers can follow network paths towards the prime nodes : we say that the system reaches an ordered state .",
    "+ in the light of the preceding arguments , it is meaningful to define a new order parameter @xmath43 as the probability that the system has for a given ( @xmath3,@xmath25 ) to reduce every number from @xmath3 into primes , that is to say , to reach an ordered state .",
    "in practice , @xmath43 is calculated in the following way : given ( @xmath3,@xmath25 ) , for each realization we check , once stationarity has been reached , whether the whole set of elements are primes or not . in the first case , @xmath43 sums up one , in the second , it sums up zero .",
    "we then average @xmath43 over every realization .",
    "+ in figure [ p ] we plot @xmath43 versus @xmath3 , for different pool sizes @xmath25 .",
    "the phase transition that the system exhibits has now a clear meaning ; when @xmath44 , the probability that the system has to be able to reduce the whole system into primes is null ( disordered state ) , and viceversa when @xmath45 .",
    "+ in each case , @xmath46 , the critical value separating the phases @xmath44 and @xmath45 , can now be defined .",
    "observe in figure [ p ] that @xmath47 increases with the pool size @xmath25 . in order to describe this size dependence ,",
    "we need to find some analytical argument by means of which define a system s characteristic size . as we will see in a few lines , this",
    "one wo nt be @xmath25 as one would expect in a first moment .",
    "+     versus @xmath3 , for the same pool sizes as figure ( [ r2 ] ) ( averaged over @xmath16 realizations ) . note that @xmath43 is now a well defined order parameter , as long as @xmath48 $ ] .",

    "find an analytical solution to the former problem is thus completely out of the focus of this paper .",
    "however , an annealed approximation can still be performed .",
    "the main idea is to obviate these two - time correlations , assuming that at each time step , the @xmath3 elements are randomly generated .",
    "this way , we can calculate , given @xmath3 and @xmath25 , the probability @xmath49 that at a single time step , no pair of molecules between @xmath3 are divisible .",
    "thus , @xmath50 will be the probability that there exist at least one reacting pair .",
    "note that @xmath50 will somehow play the role of the order parameter @xmath43 , in this oversimplified system .",
    "+ in a first step , we can calculate the probability @xmath51 that two molecules randomly chosen from the pool @xmath25 are divisible : @xmath52 where the floor brackets stand for the integer part function . obviously , @xmath53 is the probability that two molecules randomly chosen are not divisible in any case .",
    "now , in a system composed by @xmath3 molecules , we can make @xmath54 distinct pairs . however , these pairs are not independent in the present case , so that probability @xmath55 is nt simply @xmath56 . correlations between pairs must be somehow taken into account . at this point , we can make the following ansatz : @xmath57 where @xmath58 characterizes the degree of independence of the pairs .",
    "the relation @xmath59 versus @xmath3 is plotted in figure [ campo ] for different values of the pool size @xmath25 .",
    "note that for a given @xmath25 , the behavior of @xmath59 is qualitatively similar to @xmath43 , the order parameter in the real system .",
    "+ for convenience , in this annealed approximation we will define a threshold @xmath47 as the one for which @xmath60 .",
    "this value is the one for which half of the configurations reach an ordered state .",

    "the best fitting provides a relation of the shape ( [ escala1 ] ) where @xmath62 ( note that the scaling is quite good , what gives consistency to the leading order approximations assumed in equation [ escala1 ] ) .     versus the system s characteristic size in the annealed approximation .",

    "this is quite reasonable if we have in mind that the number of primes that a pool of @xmath25 integers has is on average @xmath30 @xcite : the quantity of primes does nt grow linearly with @xmath25 .",
    "this is the so called prime number theorem , and states that the number of primes in the set of integers @xmath66 is asymptotic with @xmath30 when @xmath25 is large enough .",
    "+ in order to test if this conjecture also applies to the prime number generator , in figure [ scaling2 ] we represent ( in log - log ) the values of @xmath47 ( obtained numerically from the values where @xmath67 becomes non - null for the first time ) as a function of @xmath30 .",
    "we find the same scaling relation as for the annealed system ( equation [ escala1 ] ) , but with a different value for @xmath68 .",
    "this little disagreement is logical and comes from the fact that in the annealed approximation correlations are obviated .",

    "+ in figure [ colapso ] we have collapsed all curves @xmath67 according to the preceding developments .",
    "note that the collapse is excellent , something which provides consistency to the full development .",
    "hitherto , we have seen that the dynamical process that the prime number generator shows gives rise to a continuous phase transition embedded in a direct catalytic network . as pointed out in @xcite , phase transitions quite similar to the former one as percolation processes for instance",
    "can be easily related to search problems . in the case under study",
    "we can redefine the percolation process as a decision problem in the following terms : one could ask when does the clause _ every number of the system is prime when the algorithm reaches stationarity _ is satisfied .",
    "it is clear that through this focus , the prime number generator can be understood as a sat - like problem , as long as there is an evident parallelism between the satisfiability of the preceding clause and our order parameter p. thereby , in order to study the system from the focus of computational complexity theory , we must tackle the following questions : what is the algorithmic complexity of the system ? and",
    "how is related the observed phase transition to the problem s tractability ?",
    "the algorithm under study , which generates primes by stochastic decomposition of integers , is related to both primality test and integer decomposition problems .",

    "the integer decomposition problem is in turn a harder problem , and to find an algorithm that would factorize numbers in polynomial time is an unsolved problem of computer science .",
    "furthermore , exploring the computational complexity of the problem under hands could eventually shed light into these aspects .",
    "+ for that task , let us determine how does the search space grows when we increase @xmath3 . in a given time step , the search space corresponds to the set of configurations that must be checked in order to solve the decision problem : this is nothing but the number of different pairs that can be formed using @xmath3 numbers . applying basic combinatorics ,",

    "as a matter of fact , the phase transition is related to a dynamical process embedded in a high dimensional catalytic network . in this hallmark , it is straightforward that this underlying network is non - planar @xcite .",
    "now , it has been shown that non - planarity in this kind of problems usually leaves to np - completeness @xcite ( for instance , the ising model in two - dimensions is , when the underlying network topology is non - planar , in @xmath1 ) .       as defined in the text versus @xmath3 , for different pool sizes , from left to right : @xmath81 .",
