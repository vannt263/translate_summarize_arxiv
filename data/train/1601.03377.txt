    "brown dwarfs in the field follow a tight sequence in near - infrared color magnitude diagrams ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "at the hottest and most massive end , m - type dwarfs transition to l - type dwarfs as they cool .",
    "l - dwarfs are characterized by red color and thick clouds with co as the dominant carrier of atmospheric carbon . at @xmath7 ,",
    "the l - dwarfs undergo a dramatic transition to t - type , becoming relatively cloud free , bluer , and methane dominated .    in the last few years , a growing population of objects at effective temperatures where field brown dwarfs are seen to be t - type , are instead observed to be l - type , suggesting an extension of the l - dwarf sequence to low temperature ( figure [ cmd ] ) .",
    "these objects include the four directly imaged planets in the hr  8799 system @xcite , the planetary mass binary companion 2mass  1207  b @xcite , and free floating brown dwarfs such as the planetary mass pso  j318.5 - 22 @xcite .",
    "the common characteristic of these objects is low gravity due to low mass and young age .    a recently discovered companion , vhs  j125601.92 - 125723.9  b ( hereafter vhs  1256 - 1257  b , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , age 150300 myr ; * ? ?",
    "* ) , is thought to be one of the most extreme members of the extension to the l - dwarf sequence ( figure [ cmd ] ) .",
    "it appears in many ways to be an analogue of hr  8799  b , the faintest and least massive planet in the hr  8799 system .",
    "this discovery is significant because vhs  1256 - 1257  b is substantially easier to observe than hr  8799  b as it orbits a fainter host at larger separation .",
    "this means that more precise measurements can be made with a wider array of instruments because issues with high contrast are alleviated .",
    "the variety of objects that occupy the extended l - dwarf region in color - magnitude diagrams suggests that distinguishing planets , which form via accumulation of material in a circumstellar disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , from brown dwarfs , which form as an extension of the star - formation process to low masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , requires some care ; additional constraints such as compositional differences ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or system architecture ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) must be incorporated into the analysis .    in this letter",
    "we present evidence that the host of vhs  1256 - 1257  b is actually a @xmath10 equal - mass brown dwarf binary system and discuss the implications for the nature of this system .",
    "on 2015 june 4 ut , we imaged the vhs  1256 - 1257 system ( all components simultaneously ) with magao / clio2 @xcite as part of a campaign to characterize the atmospheres of low - gravity cool companions to nearby stars .",
    "the psf of the primary appeared extended compared to brighter point - sources observed the same night .",
    "our images were obtained as acquisition images for a spectroscopic observation , so they were not optimized for highest spatial resolution .",
    "we observed in coarse platescale mode ( @xmath11 mas pixels@xmath12 ; * ? ? ? * ) through the l filter .",
    "we used 0.28  s integrations to keep the bright sky emission in the linear range of the detector .",
    "files were written with five coadded frames each .",
    "we nodded the telescope in an ab pattern , saving ten files per position . from each of the ten images per nod",
    ", we subtracted the median of the ten frames from the opposite nod position .",
    "this corrects for the bright sky emission , dark current , and the detector bias .",
    "we measured the flux ratio , separation , and position angle of the marginally - resolved binary components in each of our images by fitting a two - component model created using an image of hip  57173 an unresolved star as a template psf .",
    "our fitting procedure optimized 6-parameters including an amplitude and an @xmath13 position for each source .",
    "the best - fit model gave a magnitude difference of @xmath14 a separation of @xmath15 milliarcseconds and a pa of @xmath16 .",
    "errorbars were derived by bootstrapping the final stack of background subtracted images .",
    "all of our deduced binary parameters are reported in table [ table ] .",
    "our final stacked image is shown in figure [ binaryfig ] .      to confirm the binary nature of vhs  1256 - 1257",
    "ab we conducted follow - up imaging with a larger aperture and at shorter wavelengths to achieve better spatial resolution .",
    "we used natural - guidestar adaptive optics @xcite and the nirc2 instrument on the keck ii telescope on 2015 november 29 ut .",
    "data were collected through the j , h , and ks filters , and the camera was set up in the 9 mas pixel@xmath12 mode .",
    "we used a three - point dither pattern in order to track variable sky background .",
    "files were saved using three coadds of five second exposures .",
    "we obtained a total of 45  s of open shutter time per filter .",
    "we reduced and analyzed our nirc2 images in the same fashion as in previous work ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for each individual image , we applied standard calibrations ( dark subtraction , flat fielding ) and then fit an analytic , three - component gaussian model to both objects simultaneously . to convert the raw @xmath13 coordinates from these fits to separation and position angle ( pa ) on the sky",
    ", we applied the nonlinear distortion solution of @xcite and their corresponding pixel scale of @xmath17maspixel@xmath12 and nirc2 header orientation correction of @xmath18 . in table",
    "[ table ] we report the mean and rms of the binary parameters we derived from our individual images .",
    "the separation measurements across @xmath19 bands are in good agreement within the quoted uncertainties , but the pa values do not agree within their much smaller quoted uncertainties . since the binary components have nearly identical fluxes and colors , this is unlikely to be due to a chromatic effect , but it could be caused by recent changes to the nonlinear distortion of nirc2 ( j. lu , 2015 private communication ) .",
    "we therefore adopt the mean and rms of the separations and pas determined across @xmath19 bands as the final values , @xmath20mas and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "we also briefly observed the outer tertiary component , vhs  1256 - 1257  b. we obtained three frames in three separate nod positions one of which contained all three components at the same time .",
    "an exposure of 60 seconds was collected for each nod .",
    "we reduced these images as explained above .",
    "the object appears single down to our sensitivity .",
    "we see no equal magnitude component down to @xmath22  mas and no component 1 magnitude fainter down to @xmath23  mas .",
    "we can not rule out companions more than 2 magnitudes fainter than vhs  1256 - 1257  b.      to confirm that the binary components are physically related and not the result of a chance alignment , we inspected 2mass images from 1999 march 1 ut .",
    "we see no source at the present - day location of vhs  1256 - 1257 ab , and no sources with the correct magnitude within 2 arcminutes .",
    "given the high proper motion of the system ( @xmath0 mas yr@xmath12 ) this strongly suggests the pair is a common proper motion binary and is physically bound .",

    "@xcite report a parallax distance to vhs  1256 - 1257 of @xmath44  pc using @xmath45 months of astrometric monitoring data collected in a variety of filters together with a 2mass point .",
    "this distance was consistent with the spectrophotometric distance of the central source , given the spectroscopically determined type of m7.5@xmath460.5 @xcite , assuming that it was a single star with typical absolute magnitude ( averages taken for field objects from * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , the fact that the source is an equal magnitude binary , not a single star , requires a reexamination of the spectrophotometric distance .",
    "an equal magnitude binary will be 0.75 magnitudes brighter and the derived spectrophotometric distance will scale by a factor of @xmath47 . in table",
    "[ table ] , we show the implied spectrophotometric distance of vhs  1256 - 1257 from the apparent magnitudes of the resolved components .",
    "we use the average and rms scatter for m7.5 spectral type objects with precise parallax measurements from @xcite .",
    "the distances derived from each band are consistent with each other and suggest that the system is located at @xmath48  pc , with the uncertainty dominated by the rms variation in absolute magnitude of the population .    in this case , the distance modulus to vhs  1256 - 1257 increases by 0.66 mags and components move up in color magnitude - diagrams . in particular , the planetary mass companion would appear more like the hotter , more - massive hr  8799  d than hr  8799  b ( figure  [ cmd ] ) .",
    "furthermore , a higher luminosity for vhs  1256 - 1257  b also implies a higher mass up to @xmath49 ( for 300 myr , @xmath50 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )  placing it above the deuterium burning limit .",
    "the uvw kinematics of the system also change if it is located at 17.1  pc .",
    "while @xcite show that the uvw velocities of vhs  1256 - 1257 are consistent with the @xmath51  pic moving group , they argue that it can not be a member due to the lack of lithium and the much older age .",
    "we made use of banyan ii tool @xcite to determine the probability that the system is a member of nearby moving groups .",
    "we indicated that vhs  1256 - 1257 is less than 1 gyr old based on the very - low gravity designation of the b component . at a distance of 17.1  pc the banyan ii predicts membership in the older ab dor moving group with 66.85% probability , membership in the young field population with a 32.52% probability , and membership in the @xmath51  pic moving group of 0.48% .",
    "this scenario requires the parallax for the system to be less precise than reported , possibly due to the inhomogeneous nature of the astrometric data and the small number of epochs used to disentangle the parallax motion from the proper motion .",
    "alternatively , the parallax distance is correct and the absolute magnitude of the binary components are intrinsically quite low .    in figure",
    "[ primarycmd ] , we show the average and rms spread in absolute h - band magnitude and h - ks color for late - m field brown dwarfs ( data from * ? ? ?",
    "vhs  1256 - 1257 a and b lie well below the average m7.5 point by more than 2 @xmath52 .",
    "the uncertainty in the spectral type of the vhs  1256 - 1257  a and b does accommodate a fainter m8 spectral type .",
    "even for this spectral type the binary components are less luminous than expected , yet are near the edge of the rms scatter in the well characterized field population . at ks band , if the system is at 12.7  pc , vhs  1256 - 1257  a and b are the least luminous m7.5 objects known with m@xmath53 .",
    "grh  2208 - 20 , an m7.5 object , has m@xmath54 , all other m7.5 sources with precise parallax have m@xmath55 @xcite .",
    "even among m8 types , at 12.7  pc vhs  1256 - 1257  a and b are faint .",
    "the only other m8 with an absolute k - band luminosity greater than 10 is lhs  2397a  a ( m@xmath56 ) .",
    "such low luminosities are odd given age constraints inferred from the int - g and vl - g gravity designations given to the unresolved binary and the companion ( age @xmath57 myr ; * ? ? ?",
    "young low - gravity objects are expected to be more luminous than field objects based on theoretical evolution models and observations of young populations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the number of well characterized int - g m7 - 8 objects with which to compare our measured absolute magnitudes is small , making it difficult to rule out the low - luminosity explanation .",
    "if the parallax distance is correct , then the mass of the binary components need to be updated . using the evolutionary models of @xcite we construct a plot of age versus mass at constant luminosity ( figure [ newmass ] ) .",
    "we assume a luminosity for each source of @xmath58 , half that reported by @xcite .",
    "since the objects have no detectable lithium @xcite , we indicate in figure [ newmass ] those models which have less than 10% of the primordial lithium abundance by coloring them blue .",
    "the minimum mass for each of the binary components is @xmath1 and the corresponding minimum age is @xmath59  myr .    using our new mass estimate",
    ", we can calculate an orbital period for vhs  1256 - 1257  a and b. to do this , we take the projected separation measured in our discovery image and correct it using the projected separation  semi - major axis correction factor for a moderate discovery bias ( due to the close separation of the binary ) taken from @xcite .",
    "we find an orbital period of @xmath60  yr .",
    "if the system is located at 17.1  pc , as suggested by the photometry of the components , then the period changes because the projected separation increases as does the mass of each component . in this case , the orbital period is @xmath61 yr .",
    "given these orbital periods and our observation of @xmath62 of change in the pa of the binary components , the binary orbit can not be face - on and circular .",
    "we have shown that vhs  1256 - 1257 consists of three brown dwarf objects organized into a hierarchical triple system , the a and b components being orbited by the more distant b component .",
    "only two other brown dwarf triples appear in the literature , 2mass j08381155 + 1511155 ( composed of three t - dwarfs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and denis - p j020529.0 - 115925 ( marginally resolved late - l and early t components ; * ? ? ?",
    "neither includes m - type objects nor a planetary mass component .",
    "2m0441 + 2301 aabbab @xcite includes three substellar components including one below the deuterium burning limit , yet the system also includes a stellar component and the hierarchical quadruple architecture is much different from vhs  1256 - 1257 .",
    "vhs  1256 - 1257 shares many characteristics with 2mass j01033563 - 5515561(ab)b , a hierarchical triple with a planetary mass companion orbiting a binary composed of m6-type stars @xcite .",
    "however , vhs  1256 - 1257 is closer , older , and less massive .",
    "the hierarchical - triple orbital configuration of vhs  1256 - 1257 suggests that the system is more akin to a low mass analog of a stellar multiple , rather than a planetary system with a planet on a wide orbit .",
    "models for turbulent fragmentation suggest that isolated objects may form at masses more than a factor of two below vhs 1256 - 1257  b @xcite .",
    "the separation of vhs 1256 - 1257 ab is consistent with the sample of brown dwarf binaries observed by @xcite and @xcite , who showed that low mass binaries typically have smaller semi - major axes than their stellar counterparts .",
    "these scaled down separations are expected if brown dwarfs form as a low mass tail of the turbulent core fragmentation process @xcite .",
    "the presence of a high mass ratio ( @xmath6310% ) tertiary at relatively wide separations is similarly consistent with low mass star formation @xcite . if the three objects formed from the same filament , the objects could have undergone early dynamical interactions which naturally tighten one orbit in exchange for softening the outer most orbit @xcite .",
    "we suggest early dynamical interactions are the most likely origin for the orbital configuration due to low stellar densities in the solar neighborhood .",
    "although mutual inclination between the two orbits could induce kozai - lidov oscillation on myr timescales , the inner orbit is too wide to undergo significant tidal evolution over the lifetime of the system @xcite .",
    "we have revealed that the host of vhs  1256 - 1257  b is actually an equal - mass brown dwarf binary , making vhs  1156 - 1257 the third triple system known with exclusively substellar components .",
    "there is some tension between the parallax distance and the spectrophotometric distance to the system .",
    "this implies that either the system is more distant than reported , and the planetary mass companion more massive ( @xmath5 for an age of 300  myr ) or the components are less luminous than expected based on their age and spectral type .",
    "the architecture of this system is consistent with outcomes from normal low - mass star formation",
    ". continued astrometric monitoring of this system will resolve the tension between the luminosity and parallax distances , and enable dynamical mass measurements for the components , providing important benchmarks for these low - gravity objects .",
