    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of agn has been modeled for several decades .",
    "initial studies focused on the infrared , optical and ultraviolet continuum ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . with the inclusion of x - ray data , it was possible to define the continuum on both sides of the ultraviolet / x - ray gap ( imposed by galactic photoelectric absorption ) , and so constrain the properties of the accretion disc ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "refinements to modeling the optical / uv continuum include subtraction of the complex blended features arising from permitted iron emission , the so - called small blue - bump from the balmer continuum , and contamination across the entire spectrum from a stellar component ( @xcite ; @xcite )    the observed spectral differences between various types of agn are not only due to selective absorption and orientation effects , as implied by the simplest version of agn unification model ( @xcite ) , but also result from a wide range in basic physical parameters , such as black hole mass and accretion rate ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . to better understand the accretion processes occurring close to the super massive black hole ( smbh ) , we construct broadband seds .",
    "galactic dust reddening , together with the intrinsic reddening of the agn itself , attenuates the optical / uv band emission .",
    "furthermore , photoelectric absorption from gas modifies the lower energy x - ray continuum . but these factors can be quantified and corrected .",
    "thereby we can recover the intrinsic sed , except for the unobservable far - uv region .",
    "if we have reliable data on both sides of the energy gap between the uv and soft x - ray , we can apply a multi - component model which spans across it .",

    "+ @xmath4 : um 269 , the only object in our sample showing double - peak feature in balmer lines .",
    "two gaussian profiles are used for fitting the two peaks , thus the velocity shift of each component related to the line centre is huge . +"

    "<S> we present modeling and interpretation of the continuum and emission lines for a sample of 51 unobscured type 1 active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . </S>",
    "<S> all of these agns have high quality spectra from both xmm - newton and sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . </S>",
    "<S> we extend the wavelength coverage where possible by adding simultaneous uv data from the om onboard xmm - newton . our sample is selected based on low reddening in the optical and low gas columns implied by their x - ray spectra , except for one case , the bal - quasar pg 1004 + 130 . </S>",
    "<S> they also lack clear signatures for the presence of a warm absorber . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the observed characteristics of this sample are likely to be directly related to the intrinsic properties of the central engine .    to determine the intrinsic optical continuum we subtract the balmer continuum and all major emission lines ( including feii ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider possible effects of contamination from the host galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting continuum is then used to derive the properties of the underlying accretion disc . </S>",
    "<S> we constrain the black hole masses from spectral fits of the balmer emission lines and determine the best fit value from the modeling of broadband spectral energy distributions ( sed ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the disc component , many of these seds also exhibit a strong soft x - ray excess , plus a power law extending to higher x - ray energies . </S>",
    "<S> we fit these seds by applying a new broadband sed model which comprises the accretion disc emission , low temperature optically thick comptonisation and a hard x - ray tail by introducing the concept of a corona radius ( @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that in order to fit the data , the model often requires an additional long wavelength optical continuum component , whose origin is discussed in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the photo - recombination edge of balmer continuum shifts and broadens beyond the standard limit of 3646 , implying an electron number density which is far higher than that in the broad line region clouds .    </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that the narrow line seyfert 1s in this sample tend to have lower black hole masses , higher eddington ratios , softer 2 - 10  kev band spectra , lower 2 - 10 kev luminosities and higher @xmath0 , compared with typical broad line seyfert 1s ( bls1 ) , although their bolometric luminosities are similar . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate these differences in properties by forming an average sed for three subsamples , based on the fwhm velocity width of the h@xmath1 emission line .    </S>",
