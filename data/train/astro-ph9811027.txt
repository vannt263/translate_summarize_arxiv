    "an important physical quantity that we want to determine from gravitational microlensing data is the microlensing optical depth .",
    "this is the number of gravitational lenses lying within one einstein radius around the line of sight to a given source .    when monitoring individual stars as proposed by paczyski ( 1986 ) , the optical depth is estimated from observational data as a weighted sum of the einstein times of the individual events ( see eq .",
    "[ [ usual ] ] below ; griest 1991 ) .",
    "the einstein times are determined by fitting the theoretical microlensing lightcurve to the measured lightcurve .",
    "the fit is almost degenerate in the three fit parameters einstein time , maximum magnification , and star flux in absence of lensing ( gould 1996 ; woniak & paczyski 1997 ) . in particular , the fitted value of the einstein time depends sensitively on the value of the star flux in absence of lensing , especially at large maximum magnifications .    in pixel microlensing , which is gravitational microlensing of unresolved stars ,",
    "the star flux in absence of lensing is not generally accessible , since the combined light of all the stars contributing to a pixel is monitored simultaneously .",
    "thus , because of the above  mentioned degeneracy , the einstein time can not be reliably determined from a fit to the lightcurve . in this case , the optical depth can not be estimated by means of the usual expression , and this seems to hinder the possibility of obtaining it from pixel lensing data .    a partial solution to this problem has been proposed by gould ( 1995 & 1996 ) under conditions that may be possible in future satellite observations but are definitely not typical of present microlensing searches towards the andromeda galaxy m31 and the large magellanic cloud ( crotts 1992 , baillon et al .",

    "he assumed regular observations with constant exposure times , a constant level of noise dominated by photon counting , and large magnifications at maximum so that the microlensing lightcurve assumes a completely degenerate form ( eq .",
    "[ [ degenerate ] ] below ) . the present pixel ",
    "lensing searches instead have irregular time gaps between observations , show a variable level of noise depending on factors other than photon counting , and expect relatively low magnifications for which the microlensing curve is not well approximated by the completely degenerate form .    in this letter",
    ", we present an estimator of the optical depth in pixel microlensing that applies to all magnifications , involves measurable quantities only , and is of direct applicability to the data .",
    "it is based on the substitution of the einstein time with the product of the flux increase at maximum and of the full event duration at half - maximum , defined as the total time during which the flux increase exceeds half of its maximum value .",
    "the flux increase in a microlensing event is given by ( for pointlike lens and pointlike source ; einstein 1936 ) @xmath0 with @xmath1 here @xmath2 is the source flux in absence of lensing , @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the angular separation of lens and source , and @xmath5 is the angular einstein radius @xmath6^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the lens mass , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the distances of the source and the lens from the observer .",
    "the relative motion of lens and source during the event is usually well approximated by a uniform motion , for which @xmath10 @xmath11 is the time of maximum magnification , @xmath12 is the impact parameter in units of the einstein radius , and @xmath13 is the einstein time .",
    "this we define as the time the lens would take to cross the _ radius _ of the einstein ring , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the relative proper motion of lens and source .    in the limit of large magnifications at maximum ,",
    "the microlensing curve assumes the completely degenerate form @xmath16 ^ { -1/2 } \\qquad\\qquad      ( f , \\beta \\to 0 ; \\ ,",
    "f/\\beta = { \\rm const } ) .\\ ] ] the three parameters @xmath2 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 have reduced to two : @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "a fit to the data can determine neither the star flux @xmath2 nor the einstein time @xmath13 separately from the unknown impact parameter @xmath12 ( see e.g.  woniak & paczyski 1997 ) .",
    "the microlensing optical depth is the number of gravitational lenses lying within one einstein radius @xmath5 around the line of sight to a given source , @xmath19 where the integral is along the line of sight to the source at distance @xmath8 from the observer , and @xmath20 is the lens number density at distance @xmath9 along the same line of sight .",
    "when monitoring @xmath21 sources for a time @xmath22 , the optical depth is usually estimated as @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the optical depth averaged over the monitored sources , the sum is over the observed events , and @xmath25 is the detection efficiency ( normalized to impact parameters @xmath26 ) as a function of einstein time @xmath13 .",
    "the einstein time of each event is determined experimentally by a fit of the theoretical microlensing lightcurve to the measured lightcurve .",
    "this usual estimator is based on the relation @xmath27 in the right hand side , @xmath28 ; in the left - hand side , @xmath29 is the differential number of monitored stars , @xmath30 is the event rate per source , @xmath31 , and the integration is limited to impact parameters @xmath32 .",
    "( [ usual ] ) follows from solving eq .",
    "( [ basic_usual ] ) for @xmath24 and rescaling the observed number of events @xmath33 to the expected number of events @xmath34 by means of the detection efficiency @xmath25 normalized to @xmath32 . explicitly @xmath35",
    "we now prove a relation similar to eq .",
    "( [ basic_usual ] ) but not involving the einstein time @xmath13 , which is very poorly measurable in pixel lensing .",
    "let @xmath36 be the event duration at half - maximum and @xmath37 be the flux increase at maximum . both",
    "are easily determined from a fit to the lightcurve .",
    "then @xmath38 here @xmath39 is the total flux of the monitored sources , @xmath40 is 2.1465 , and @xmath41 is the optical depth averaged over the monitored sources , each source weighted by its flux , @xmath42 .",
    "this flux - weighted optical depth @xmath41 equals the averaged optical depth @xmath24 whenever the source luminosity function is , or can be considered as , independent of source position , because in this case the averages over source positions and fluxes are independent .",
    "this is the case for a single source population .",
    "the proof of eq .",
    "( [ basic_ours ] ) is as follows .",
    "we express the half - maximum duration @xmath36 as a function of @xmath13 and @xmath12 by finding the value of the impact parameter @xmath43 at which the flux increase equals half of its maximum value .",
    "we also express the maximum flux increase @xmath44 in terms of the source flux @xmath2 in absence of lensing and of the impact parameter @xmath45 .",
    "we find @xmath46 and @xmath47 , with @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : f ] ) .",
    "the integral over @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ basic_ours ] ) is then @xmath52 the remaining integral over the sources gives the total source flux @xmath53 times the flux - weighted optical depth @xmath41 .",
    "putting the factors together gives eq .",
    "( [ basic_ours ] ) .",
    "if all events could be detected , then eq .  ( [ basic_ours ] ) would immediately give an estimator for the optical depth , namely @xmath54 notice that apart from the numerical factor @xmath55 , @xmath41 equals the sum over events of the products of the fractional flux increase at maximum @xmath56 and of the fraction of observing time spent above half - maximum @xmath57 .",
    "the estimator in eq .",
    "( [ ours_ideal ] ) does not depend on the source luminosity funciton .    in practice",
    ", there is always a minimum detectable @xmath37 , if only because of poissonian fluctuations in photon counting .",
    "moreover , the irregularity and the discreteness of the time coverage limit the range of event time scales a microlensing search can access .",
    "we can restrict the sum in eq .",
    "( [ ours_ideal ] )  and the integral in eq .",
    "( [ basic_ours ] )  to events with @xmath58 , a convenient detection threshold .",
    "we obtain @xmath59 where we have defined an effective flux @xmath60 @xmath61 being the source luminosity function and @xmath62 .",
    "this is the basic form of the new optical depth estimator that we advocate for pixel lensing .",
    "( [ ours_thr ] ) is written for a single source population ; for several populations , similar equations apply to each population separately .    in the next section",
    "we discuss the dependence of the effective flux @xmath63 and of the new optical depth estimator on the source luminosity function .",
    "the effective flux @xmath64 is smaller than the total flux @xmath65 and is equal to @xmath65 when @xmath66 .",
    "it depends in principle on the details of the source luminosity function , but in practice the ratio @xmath67 is an almost universal function of the fluctuation magnitude @xmath68 ( defined in tonry & schneider 1988 ) .",
    "this is exemplified in fig .  1 for four luminosity functions : ( 1 ) the local neighborhood in the @xmath69-band ( jahrei  & wielen 1998 ) ; ( 2 ) 47 tucanae in the @xmath69-band ( hesser et al . 1987 ) ;",
    "( 3 ) the m31 bulge in the @xmath70-band ( rich , mould , and graham 1993 ) ; ( 4 ) the galactic bulge in the @xmath71-band ( terndrup , frogel and whitford 1990 ; holtzman et al .",
    "the upper panel shows @xmath72 as a function of @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the surface magnitude corresponding to the effective flux , @xmath15 is the actual surface magnitude , and @xmath75 is the magnitude corresponding to the threshold flux increase @xmath76 .",
    "the lower panel shows the fractional differences in effective flux with respect to the mean over the luminosity functions considered , which is also the relative error in the estimated optical depth . at very low thresholds ( @xmath77 ) , the effective surface magnitude tends to the actual surface magnitude , and this for all luminosity functions . at very high thresholds ( @xmath78 , the magnitude of the brightest star ) ,",
    "the difference between effective and actual surface magnitudes is simply @xmath79 , and this again for all luminosity functions .",
    "the largest deviations from a universal behavior occur at detection thresholds close to the fluctuation magnitude , and for the luminosity functions considered here they are never larger than 30% . if the statistical errors in the determination of the optical depth will be smaller than these systematic errors ( we recall that the present error on the optical depth towards the lmc is @xmath80 [ alcock et al .",
    "1997 ] ) , the systematic errors can of course be reduced by measuring the source luminosity function in deep exposures , even independently of the microlensing search itself .",
    "a given microlensing search is only sensitive to a range of einstein times and radii , and can only measure the contributions to the optical depth coming from this range . indeed , with a finite time coverage , there is a minimum event duration set by the finite exposure time and the interval between successive images , and a maximum event duration set by the total time span of the observations .",
    "moreover , for sources with finite angular extensions , there is a reduction in flux increase with respect to the pointlike case when the lens transits the source disk . as a consequence ,",
    "the fraction of observable events is different according to the einstein time and radius of each event .",
    "we write the optical depth observable in a given microlensing search as @xmath81 ( compare with eq .  [ [ optdepth ] ] , where @xmath82 ) . here",
    "@xmath83 is the relative transverse velocity of lens and source .",
    "the function @xmath84 represents the sensitivity of a given experiment to the different contributions to the optical depth , and depends on the observing conditions and data analysis and on the choice of the optical depth estimator .",
    "we call @xmath84 the optical depth sensitivity . for the usual estimator",
    ", @xmath84 equals the detection efficiency as a function of @xmath13 and @xmath5 . for the new estimator in eq .",
    "( [ ours_thr ] ) , @xmath84 is @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the event detection efficiency ( counting efficiency ) .    in an actual survey , the optical depth sensitivity , like the efficiency , has to be evaluated in a monte - carlo simulation .",
    "events are generated , and two histograms in the binned @xmath87 plane are constructed : one counting the events detected by the selection algorithm in the given observing conditions , the other including all events above the reference threshold @xmath76 . weighting each event by @xmath88 and summing over events , the two histograms evaluate the numerator and denominator of eq .",
    "( [ sensitivity ] ) .",
    "the sensitivity is then their bin - by - bin ratio .    to illustrate the dependence of the optical depth sensitivity on the luminosity function",
    ", we consider a simple expression for the detection efficiency .",
    "we count all events for which the flux increase stays above the threshold @xmath89 for a duration longer than @xmath90 but shorter than @xmath91 . in addition ,",
    "in this example we neglect photometric errors and finite - source effects ( so to have a dependency on @xmath13 only ) .",
    "this translates into @xmath92 for @xmath93 and @xmath94 otherwise .",
    "we calculate the optical depth sensitivity for the luminosity functions mentioned previously , and plot the results in fig .  2 .",
    "each panel corresponds to a value of the threshold magnitude @xmath75 , and @xmath95 is fixed at 100 .",
    "although the details differ from luminosity function to luminosity function , the sensitivity curves are similar , especially considering that with a more realistic expression for the detection efficiency these curves would be smoothed out and that in a comparison with a model they would be folded with the model @xmath13 distribution and then integrated .",
    "again , a measurement of the luminosity function would reduce even these small systematic uncertainties .",
    "we finally comment on finite - source effects . with sources of finite angular diameter , the flux increase in a microlensing event does not reach the value of the pointlike case whenever the lens is over the disk of the source .",
    "the exact light curve depends on the luminosity distribution on the disk of the star , and in general it is a complicated function . a simple account of finite - size effects consists in stopping the flux increase when @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the angular radius of the source . given the minimum detectable flux increase @xmath76 ,",
    "events with @xmath98 but @xmath99 are undetected .",
    "the efficiency becomes a function of the einstein radius @xmath5 , as does the sensitivity .",
    "the optical depth sensitivity as a function of @xmath13 _ and _ @xmath100 can be calculated from eq .",
    "( [ sensitivity ] ) once a relation between stellar radius and luminosity is specified .",
    "we have checked that also in this case the behavior of the sensitivity is almost universal .",
    "we have proposed an estimator of the optical depth in pixel microlensing experiments that involves only measurable quantities .",
    "our new estimator is not limited to events with large magnifications at maximum and applies equally well to satellite and ground - based observations .",
    "our estimator is based on the idea of characterizing the event not by the einstein time and the maximum magnification but by the full event duration at half - maximum and the flux increase at maximum .",
    "the latter are easily determined from a fit to the event lightcurve .",
    "the new estimator of the microlensing optical depth is an efficiency - weighted sum over events of the products of the fractional flux increase at maximum and of the fraction of observing time spent above half - maximum .    in the ideal case of no noise and complete time coverage , our proposed optical depth estimator",
    "does not depend on the source luminosity function . in a real situation",
    ", an experiment is only sensitive to events above a threshold and to a range of einstein times and radii .",
    "we have shown that the sensitivity and the effective flux depend on the luminosity function in an almost universal way through the surface brightness fluctuation magnitude .",
    "residual uncertainties can be removed , if needed , by measuring the luminosity function in deep exposures .",
    "our new estimator applies not only to pixel microlensing data but also to blended and individually monitored sources . in the latter case",
    ", it could be interestingly compared with the standard estimator based on einstein times .",
    "if agreement is found , the optical depth estimator we propose may indeed open the way to the determination of physical parameters from pixel microlensing data .",
