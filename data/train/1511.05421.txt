    "magnetic nanostructures ( e. g. thin films , wires , rods , quantum dots ) are at the focus of research today because they exhibit novel fundamental properties which are exploited in a broad range of applications .",
    "particularly , the reduced material volume of low - dimensional magnetic systems poses real challenges to neutron based techniques .",
    "therefore , development of new methods for the characterizations of magnetic structures at nanoscale is important , especially as new neutron spallation sources are being built .",
    "neutrons have a magnetic moment , isotopic sensitivity and high penetration ability .",
    "therefore neutron scattering is a powerful method for the investigation of magnetic materials , polymers and biological systems and for nondestructive control of materials in bulk .",
    "polarized neutron reflectometry ( pnr ) [ 1 ] is successfully used for the investigation of thin magnetic films of thickness smaller than 100 nm and down to 0.1 nm [ 2 ] .",
    "pnr can extract the absolute magnitude and the direction of the magnetization in each thin layer in a multilayer structure with a high spatial sensitivity of about 0.1 nm in the direction perpendicular to the film surface .",
    "however conventional specular reflectometry can not easily resolve thicknesses which are larger than 100 nm and remains insensitive to the in - plane structures .",
    "nevertheless , the sensitivity to in - plane structures is provided by off - specular neutron scattering [ 3 ] .",
    "scattered intensity appears in the reciprocal space around the specular line when a film has in - plane structures in the direction along the beam propagation , with scales ranging from 600 nm to 60 @xmath0 m .",
    "grazing incidence small - angle neutron scattering ( gisans ) [ 4,5 ] can be used when the film has in - plane structures in the direction perpendicular to the beam path . for this case",
    "the momentum transfer takes place in a scattering plane which is perpendicular to the incidence plane and provides sensitivity to inhomogeneities in the range 3 to 100 nm .",
    "the main peculiarity of the neutron methods mentioned above is that they do not provide direct information on the magnetic and structural properties , but rely largely on model dependent algorithms .",
    "this means that we can not retrieve the structure of the investigated object directly from the neutron intensity .",
    "it is the consequence of the fact that the phase of the neutron wave function is lost during the elastic neutron interaction with matter . to describe the measured reflectivity , a model of the investigated system",
    "must be provided .",
    "then the calculated reflectivity corresponding to this model is compared with the experimental data .",
    "the initial model is further refined until one model describes best a data set .",
    "the best model corresponds to the minimum of difference between calculated and experimental data .",
    "here we review three different neutron methods which provide a direct measurement of the magnetic induction from experimental data : larmor precession , zeeman spatial beam - splitting and neutron spin resonance ( nsr ) .",

    "the neutron interaction with a magnetic media contains nuclear and magnetic contributions . to extract a magnetic component which is rather small as compared to a nuclear one ,",
    "polarized neutrons are used .",
    "the polarization degree of the neutron beam is defined as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are respectively the number of neutrons with spin parallel and antiparallel to the direction of the applied external magnetic field .",
    "the polarization of a fully polarized beam is equal to @xmath71 .",

    "partially polarized neutron beams have a polarization @xmath8 .",
    "the process of decreasing the polarization degree is termed as _",
    "depolarization_.    the theory of neutron depolarization during its passage through the magnetic domains was developed by halpern and holstein [ 6 ] .",
    "neutron depolarization was proposed by rekveldt as a method of investigation of bulk domain structures [ 7 ] .",
    "this method of depolarization was widely used in 1980 - 90s for the investigation of ferro- and ferrimagnetics and high - tc superconductors . inside a magnetic cluster , larmor precession of the neutron spin around the vector of local magnetic",
    "induction takes place . from the exponential depolarization curve",
    ", a dispersion of the magnetic induction may be extracted .",
    "this method is however again model - dependent .",
    "the particular case of depolarization at larmor precession has been proposed as an experimental method using time - of - flight ( tof ) technique [ 8,9 ] .",
    "this method was used for the investigation of magnetic amorphous ribbons [ 10 ] . a similar method using fixed wavelength",
    "was used for the investigation of very soft permalloy films [ 11,12 ] .",
    "the scheme of the measuring method is presented in fig .",
    "a magnetic film is placed under an angle @xmath9 to the external applied magnetic field @xmath10 .",
    "the angle between the external applied magnetic field and the average magnetic induction @xmath11 in the film is @xmath2 .",
    "the neutron path inside the film is d. the initial polarization @xmath12 is directed along the applied field @xmath10 and the angle between the vectors @xmath12 and @xmath11 is @xmath2 .",
    "the component of the polarization perpendicular to @xmath11 leads to a larmor precession of the neutron spin in the mean internal field < b>. the larmor precession frequency depends on the value of the magnetic induction as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the gyromagnetic ratio of the neutron .",
    "the angle of larmor precession in the film is @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the travelling time along the path @xmath17 inside the film for neutrons of velocity @xmath18 . from the expression of momentum",
    ", it follows that @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the neutron mass,@xmath21 is the plank s constant and @xmath22 is the neutron wavelength .",
    "thus , the angle of precession in the neutron wavelength scale can be written as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 , with @xmath25 in [ @xmath26 , @xmath27 in [ @xmath28 , d in [ @xmath0 m ] . from simple geometric considerations ,",
    "we obtain the following expression for the case of a uniform magnetic induction @xmath29 : @xmath30 in the case of magnetic fluctuations along the neutron path , additional depolarization coefficients @xmath31 and @xmath32 must be introduced in ( [ eq1 ] ) : @xmath33 . in the theory of halpern - holstein",
    "[ 4 ] the depolarization coefficients are approximated by exponentials : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are constants depending on the mean square induction fluctuations @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and the mean size of inhomogeneities .",
    "the experimental results of measurements on systems with magnetic inhomogeneities are described in details in [ 9 ] .    here",
    "we consider the case of a uniformly magnetized film with a magnetic induction @xmath39 . in fig .",
    "1b , the normalized polarization is calculated as a function of the neutron wavelength .",
    "the parameters for the calculations are the following : b=1.2 t , d=14.62 @xmath0 m , @xmath1 .",
    "one can see that the first minimum of the periodic oscillation dependence occurs at the characteristic wavelength @xmath40 .",
    "this point corresponds to a precession of @xmath41 . from this condition",
    "we can define the value of the magnetic induction : @xmath42    from the equation ( [ eq1 ] ) we can extract the angle @xmath2 as : @xmath43    in fig . 1c , the normalized polarization is calculated for different angles @xmath2 at @xmath44  t and @xmath45 as a function of the neutron wavelength .",
    "one can see that at @xmath3 ( for which the vector of magnetic induction is perpendicular to the applied magnetic field ) the amplitude of the polarization at the minimum at @xmath40 is maximal . when decreasing @xmath2 angles , the amplitude is decreased and becomes zero at @xmath46 ( there is no larmor precession when the magnetic induction is parallel to the applied field ) .    in fig .",
    "1d , the normalized polarization is calculated for different values of the magnetic induction @xmath47 at @xmath3 and @xmath45 as a function of the neutron wavelength .",
    "one can see that the period of the larmor precession is decreasing as @xmath47 increases .",
    "let us consider experimental results .",
    "a @xmath48 thick magnetic film fe(86 at%)al(9.6%)si(4.4% ) on a ceramic substrate which is 10(along the beam)x20x1@xmath49 was investigated at the polarized neutron spectrometer spn-1 ( reactor ibr-2 , jinr , dubna , russia ) .",
    "ibr-2 is a pulsed reactor and therefore the tof technique was used for these measurements .",
    "an external magnetic field @xmath50  koe was applied under an angle @xmath51 with respect to the sample surface ( see fig.1a ) .",
    "the angle between the neutron beam and the sample surface was @xmath52 .",
    "thus , the path of the beam inside the film was @xmath53 m .",
    "the experimental setup was the following : a neutron polarizer , a spin - flipper of korneev type , the sample was placed in the electromagnet , an analyzer and a @xmath54he gas monodetector [ 13,14 ] .",
    "the polarizer and the analyzer were made of 5 m long neutron guides , each consisting of two curved magnetic mirrors [ 14,15 ] . at the exit of the polarizer ,",
    "the polarized neutron beam is shaped by a narrow vertical slit of 2.5x100  @xmath55 .",
    "the sample was placed also vertically and masked with a diaphragm of 2.0x15  @xmath55 .",
    "the distances were the following : the distance polarizer - sample was 3  m , the distance sample - analyzer was 2.27  m , the distance sample - detector was 8  m , the tof base was 37  m.    the experimental curves of the normalized polarization as a function of the neutron wavelength at different external fields are presented in fig .",
    "the points are the experimental data and lines are the calculated curves for the experimentally obtained parameters .",
    "one can see a minimum at @xmath40 corresponding to half the period of larmor precession .",
    "this minimum moves to the left side as the value of the applied field is increasing . from this experimental data we extracted directly the value of the magnetic induction (",

    "oe , the magnetic induction vector is directed parallel to the film plane due to demagnetizing factor ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the point at 4.5  koe corresponds to the data for fealsi film of the thickness of 20  @xmath0 m extracted from the spatial beam - splitting described in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "one can see that the beam - splitting data overlap with the larmor precession data .",
    "the method of larmor precession described above can be used for the direct determination of magnetic induction values . in the next section",
    "we will present the method of zeeman spatial beam - splitting which takes place at an interface in magnetically non - collinear systems .",
    "zeeman spatial beam - splitting takes place only in magnetically non - collinear systems in which there is a sharp change of orientation between the external applied field ( quantization field ) and the magnetic induction in the magnetic system .",
    "several such experimental situations are presented in fig .",
    "3 . magnetic thin films exhibit large shape anisotropy , forcing the magnetization to be oriented in the film plane .",
    "thus it is possible to apply rather large external fields @xmath57 perpendicular to the film while the magnetization essentially remains in the film plane ( fig .",
    "when the film has very large in - plane anisotropy the external magnetic field @xmath57 may be applied in the film plane but perpendicular to the anisotropy axis so that the magnetization and @xmath57 are not collinear ( fig .",

    "spin - flip and beam - splitting at the boundary of two magnetically non - collinear media were predicted theoretically [ 16 ] and observed experimentally in a reflection geometry [ 17,18 ] .",
    "the theory of spin - flip was developed in [ 19 ] .",

    "the total energy is transferred on the perpendicular component @xmath68 ( see fig .",
    "this change in the scattering wave - vector leads to a measurable change in the reflection direction off the specular direction which is easily observable in neutron reflectivity experiments .",

    "we also stress that this case of  off - specular  scattering has a very different origin from the diffuse scattering due to in - plane sample microstructures for which the change in the scattering wave - vector @xmath70 is due to an in - plane momentum transfer .",

    "the accuracy of this method is defined by the width of the resonance ( 4.6 % fwhm ) which depends on the reflectometer resolution and also on the properties of the material .",
    "we have presented three neutron scattering methods which allow the determination of the magnetic induction in absolute value in magnetic films : the larmor precession , the zeeman spatial beam - splitting and the neutron spin resonance . for the larmor precession and the beam - splitting",
    "we have compared experiments performed on similar films of the same material fealsi .",
    "we have shown that these films are homogeneous and uniformly magnetized .",
    "the neutron methods have the advantages that they have the potential to provide information about the homogeneity of the magnetization of the film through its thickness .",
    "the refraction method in particular can easily identify differences in magnetization at the top or bottom interfaces of a system . besides , the neutron beam - splitting method presented here is not sensitive to the thickness of the film and thus an accurate knowledge of the film thickness is not necessary in contrast to bulk magnetometry .",
    "such techniques could find applications to the study of thick films of permanent magnets .",
    "the neutron spin resonance was used for the investigation of a non - saturated magnetic film .",
    "the magnetic state of the film was characterized by polarized neutron reflectometry and vsm which are averaging methods over an ensemble of the magnetic domains .",
    "the method of neutron spin resonance provides the value of magnetic induction inside an individual magnetic domain .",
    "this is a unique way of obtaining such quantitative information on the induction value compared to other techniques such as kerr microscopy or mfm .",
