    "the above result applies to systems with both uncorrelated and correlated random potentials , provided the considered system can be divided into blocks , which are much longer than the disorder correlation scale and can be treated as nearly independent scatterers .",
    "thus , the general form of the large-@xmath18 limit of the transmission distribution is well understood , and the remaining questions are about the dependence of the cumulant coefficients @xmath29 on the parameters of the problem . according to eq .",
    "( [ cn coefs - def_0 ] ) , transmission statistics can be discussed at the following three levels of `` resolution '' .",
    "first , there exists a self - averaging quantity @xmath30 , which has a non - random limit@xmath31 at this level , all the information about the transmission fluctuations is lost in the asymptotic limit @xmath32 .",
    "next , one can define a variable @xmath33 , where @xmath34 , for which the central limit theorem holds , and whose cumulants of the order @xmath35 vanish in the asymptotic limit @xmath32 as @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , this veriable has a limiting gaussian distribution with zero mean and unit variance .",
    "limiting probability distributions and their relation to universality and scaling have been discussed in the past @xcite,@xcite . in the present context of a 1d problem ,",
    "only two model - dependent parameters , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , are `` remembered '' in the limiting distribution of @xmath39 .",
    "this fact is referred to as `` two - parameter scaling '' @xcite . in special conditions ,",
    "namely when the combined scatterers are weak and their reflection phases are distributed uniformly , the composition rule yields @xmath40 up to weak disorder corrections , which is a manifestation of single parameter scaling ( sps ) @xcite,@xcite .    finally , for large but finite @xmath18 , one can study the non - gaussian corrections to the limiting gaussian distribution , which are characterized by the asymptotic cumulant coefficients @xmath29 , @xmath35 .",
    "the latter are responsible for the extreme fluctuations of the transmission coefficient .",
    "these large deviations can also be studied in terms of the generalized les , which describe asymptotic growth rates of the moments of the inverse transmission coefficient @xmath41  and can be expressed as a sum over @xmath29 s @xcite .    under conditions of weak scattering and phase randomization , in addition to the sps relation @xmath40 , it was found in some models of disorder that cumulant ratios",
    "@xmath42 , @xmath35 , vanish up to the weak disorder corrections @xcite,@xcite .",
    "vanishing of higher cumulants is also indicated by the coincidence of le @xmath15 and the second order generalized le @xmath43 in the lowest order of the weak disorder expansion , which is valid for a wide variety of 1d disordered models @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "thus , quite generally , cumulant coefficients @xmath29 satisfy@xmath44 which holds up to the weak disorder corrections .",
    "considerable analytical and numerical effort was devoted to verification of sps and determining limits of its validity for various models of disorder @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "usually , sps holds for sufficiently weak disorder , when the localization length is much larger than other scales in the problem ( see also discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "deviations from relations ( [ sps rel ] ) were studied for uncorrelated disorder @xcite,@xcite,@xcite as well as for some specific models of correlated disorder potentials @xcite,@xcite . in particular , for the continuous white noise model , it was shown @xcite that @xmath45 for large positive energy @xmath4 ( weak disorder ) , becomes slightly different from unity near @xmath46 and vanishes for large negative @xmath4 , while the `` non - gaussian '' ratios @xmath47 have numerical values of about a fraction of unity near @xmath46 , and vanish for large negative or positive @xmath4 ( energy scale is determined by strength of disorder ) .",
    "thus , in the white noise model , unless @xmath4 is sufficiently large and negative , the relative width of the gaussian bulk of the @xmath1-distribution depends weakly on the disorder strength , while finite higher cumulants indicate that some non - gaussian corrections to the distribution tails develop in strong disorder .",
    "the latter was also observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where distribution of local lyapunov exponents was studied in terms of the generalized les for a continuous @xmath48-correlated disorder .",
    "presence of disorder correlations can significantly enhance deviation from relations ( [ sps rel ] ) .",
    "for instance , one finds @xmath49 near certain energies of the tight - binding model with a weak short - range correlated disorder @xcite .",
    "another example of the effect of correlations is scaling relation @xmath50 , obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for strong exponentially correlated dichotomous disorder with a correlation scale @xmath51 .",
    "this scaling , which replaces eq .",
    "( [ sps rel ] ) , is valid when @xmath52 , which means @xmath53 , so that gaussian bulk of the distribution @xmath54 becomes much broader than in weak or white noise disorder .",
    "these special examples suggest that disorder correlations can have a significant effect on the transmission statistics .",
    "one can distinguish two limiting regimes . in weak disorder , which can be treated perturbatively , le depends strongly on the correlation scale @xmath51 @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "however , it usually remains the only parameter of the transmission distribution , and relations ( [ sps rel ] ) stay valid @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "another special regime , which can be called a semiclassical regime of strong disorder , occurs when typical random potential barriers are higher than energy @xmath4 and sufficiently broad , so that tunneling probability already through a single random barrier becomes small . in this case localization",
    "is dominated by the under - barrier tunneling , and one can generalize the semiclassical approach of ref .",

    "for the strong disorder regime to show that @xmath56 .",
    "the main focus of the present research is , however ,  on the effect of disorder correlations on the transmission distribution at the transition between these two limiting regimes .",
    "we consider model ( [ schrodinger ] ) with gaussian disorder @xmath9 , whose correlation function is arbitrary , except for the assumption that it is parametrized with a finite correlation scale @xmath51 .",
    "the transmission statistics is studied in terms of the dimensionless ratios @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "quantity @xmath59 characterizes extreme fluctuations of the inverse transmission coefficient @xmath41 , since it is related to the ratio of the average to the typical values of @xmath41 .",
    "in addition , it can be used to show violation of relations ( [ sps rel ] ) , because @xmath60 when these relations hold @xcite,@xcite .    to calculate @xmath43 , which can not be treated exactly in a general case of correlated disorder",
    ", we develop a small-@xmath51 approximation @xcite .",
    "a simple regularization is proposed to extend this method to the power law correlations , for which a standard approximation turns out to be inapplicable .",
    "numerical simulations are used to verify the analytical approximation for @xmath43 and to calculate cumulant coefficients @xmath61 for different types of correlations and for different values of @xmath51 ( and @xmath62 ) . as expected , the obtained results for @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 show that sps and eq .",
    "( [ sps rel ] ) hold in the weak disorder limit . beyond this regime",
    ", we find that disorder correlations strongly enhance deviations from relations ( [ sps rel ] ) , as compared to the case of white noise , and lead to increase of both typical and extreme fluctuations of transmission .",
