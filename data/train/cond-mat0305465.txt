    "various ionic systems including electrolyte solutions , molten salts , and colloids can be studied with a good approximation in the framework of the so - called primitive model ( pm ) which consists in a mixture of @xmath0 species of charged hard spheres ( hs ) which differ by their respective charges and ( or ) diameters.@xcite of special interest is the restricted primitive model ( rpm ) where @xmath1 , the hard spheres have all the same diameter , and the cations and anions bear opposite charges @xmath2 . in many instances",
    ", we shall also consider the special primitive model ( spm ) , where the number @xmath0 of species as well as the charges are arbitrary but all the ions have the same diameter @xmath3 .",
    "in the two first parts of this work , published some years ago and hereafter referred to as i and ii , we have established an exact field theoretical representation of the rpm.@xcite the action of this field theory , which is obtained by applying the kac - siegert - stratonovich - hubbard - edwards ( ksshe ) @xcite transform to the coulomb potential , looks like the sine - gordon action to which it reduces in the limit of point - like ions,@xcite hence the slightly abusive title of this series of papers .",
    "nowadays we prefer the acronym ksshe to christen the action .",
    "the extended sine - gordon action derived in paper i for the rpm is obtained here for a general pm .",
    "the regularization of the coulomb potential which is required to define properly the ksshe transform is obtained by a smearing of the charge over the hs volume .",
    "a more general treatment where a part of the coulomb interaction is incorporated in the reference system is discussed in the review of brydges and martin .",
    "@xcite    the developments of refs .",
    "i and ii are based on a cumulant expansion of the grand partition function reorganized in ascending powers of either the fugacity or the inverse temperature . in this way",
    "one can obtain the exact low fugacity and high temperature expansions of the pressure and the free energy of the rpm .",
    "of course the expressions obtained in that manner are already known from the theory of liquids and were derived years ago in the framework of mayer graph expansions.@xcite in the present paper we proceed differently . after having obtained the ksshe action for the general pm ( see sec .",
    "[ ksshe ] ) , we reorganize the cumulant expansion by grouping some classes of feynman diagrams . the resulting loopwise expansion is explicitly computed up to order two in the number of loops . in the case of the rpm ,",
    "the two - loop order free energy turns out to coincide with an expression derived more than thirty years ago by chandler and andersen @xcite in the framework of the so - called mode expansion theory.@xcite reorganizing the loop - expansion in ascending powers of the inverse temperature gives back the high - temperature expansions of paper  ii and ref.@xcite    our paper is organized in the following way . in next section  ii",
    "we show how to construct a well - defined ksshe transform by regularizing the coulomb potential at short distances by means of a smearing of the charges inside the volumes of the hs . in section",
    "iii we establish the general relations between the charge correlation functions and the correlations of the ksshe field . from the known asymptotic behavior of",
    "the former one can deduce that of the latter .",
    "the conclusion , which is detailed at length in section  iv , is that the n - body correlations of the ksshe field are short - ranged functions ; stated otherwise , the ksshe field is a non - critical field .",
    "the so - called stillinger - lovett sum rules , both for the homogeneous @xcite and the inhomogeneous fluid @xcite emerge as a consequence of this behavior . in section  v the mean field ( mf ) level of the theory is studied in detail .",
    "the mf free energy @xmath4 is shown to be a strictly convex functional of the @xmath0 partial densities and to constitute a rigorous lower bound of the exact free energy .",
    "the former property excludes a fluid - fluid transition at the mf level while the latter serves to define an optimized mf free energy by maximizing @xmath4 with respect to the variations of the smearing functions .",
    "an explicit expression of the optimized @xmath4 is obtained in the case of an homogeneous fluid . from the mf solution for the inhomogeneous system",
    "we also deduce the expressions of the n - body correlation and vertex functions of the homogeneous system in the gaussian approximation.@xcite this gaussian approximation is discussed in section  vi and shown to be equivalent to the random phase approximation ( rpa ) of the theory of liquids.@xcite finally , a two - loop order calculation is performed in section  vii . the resulting expression for the the free energy of the rpm",
    "is shown to be identical with that obtained by chandler and andersen @xcite in the framework of the first version of the mode expansion theory .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section  viii .",
    "we shall consider only the three dimensional ( 3d ) version of the ( pm ) , i.e. a mixture of @xmath0 species of charged hard spheres.@xcite the ions of the species @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) are characterized by their diameter @xmath7 and their electric charge @xmath8 .",
    "the molecular structure of the solvent is ignored and it is treated as a continuum , the dielectric constant of which has been absorbed in the definition of the charges @xmath8 .",
    "the solution is made of _ both _ positive _ and _ negative ions so that the electroneutrality in the bulk can be satisfied without adding any unphysical neutralizing background to the system .",
