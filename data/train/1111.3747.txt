    "the main symmetry of torus links , @xmath0 , is a trivial geometric fact .",
    "however , it is hardly visible on the level of standard diagrams ; the braids @xmath1 and",
    "@xmath2 do not even have the same number of crossings .",
    "we propose a diagram of the fibre surface of torus links that exhibits the symmetry of the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the following description is motivated by acampo s new tte -  - tte vision of the monodromy of isolated plane curve singularities  @xcite .",
    "it relies on the fact that the fibre surface of the torus link @xmath5 retracts on a complete bipartite graph of type @xmath6  @xcite",
    ". this fact can be seen explicitly in figure  1 , where the fibre surface of the torus knot @xmath7 is drawn as a union of @xmath8 ribbons along the edges of the graph @xmath9 embedded in @xmath10 .",
    "we will shortly explain this in detail .",
    "ribbon diagrams offer a lot of possibilities to perform cobordisms by cutting ribbons .",
    "for example , the three cuts shown in figure  2 result in a disjoint union of two trefoil knots .",
    "it turns out that many ribbon cuts correspond to smoothings of certain crossing in the standard diagrams of torus links .",
    "this suggests to look at links associated with subgraphs of the complete bipartite graphs @xmath11 .",
    "let us call these bipartite graph links .",
    "the family of bipartite graph links coincides with the family of strongly quasipositive links .",
    "bipartite graph links contain various well - studied classes of links , for example positive braids links and lorenz links .",
    "we will single out these classes in terms of bipartite graphs . as an application",
    ", we obtain a curious duality on standard diagrams of twisted torus links .",
    "this is the content of section  3",
    ".    given two fixed natural numbers @xmath12 , we may ask which links can be obtained by cutting ribbons of the embedded complete bipartite graph @xmath6 .",
    "this innocent question turns out to be a hard one .",
    "in fact , it may be related to the adjacency problem for plane curve singularities .",
    "we will offer perspectives on this in section  4 .",
    "the last section is devoted to a notion of density that comes naturally with bipartite graph links .",
    "as we will see , links with a high density share at least one property with torus links : their signature invariant has a high defect from maximality .",
    "this manuscript was greatly influenced by various people .",
    "special thanks go to norbert acampo , peter feller , christian graf and masaharu ishikawa for their inspiring inputs .",
    "we need precise definitions for bipartite graph links , quasipositive surfaces and strongly quasipositive links before proving theorem  1 .",
    "let @xmath13 be two skew lines .",
    "we will fix @xmath14 , @xmath15 , for simplicity .",
    "let @xmath16 be a finite union of straight line segments , each one having one endpoint on @xmath17 and one on @xmath18 .",
    "thus @xmath19 is an embedded bipartite graph .",
    "the ribbon surface associated with @xmath19 is made up of ribbons , one for each edge of @xmath19 , whose projections onto the @xmath20-plane are immersions ( see figures  1 , 2 and  4 for an illustration ) .    a link in @xmath10",
    "is called a bipartite graph link , if it is the boundary of a ribbon surface in the above sense .",
    "we claim that the links associated with complete bipartite graphs are precisely torus links .",
    "in fact , given an embedded complete bipartite graph @xmath16 with @xmath3 and @xmath4 vertices on @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively , we may deform the corresponding link @xmath21 into the standard braid diagram @xmath1 of @xmath5 .",
    "this deformation is performed in two steps .",
    "\\(1 ) each vertex on the lower line @xmath18 is adjacent to precisely @xmath3 edges of @xmath19 , the union of which we call a fork .",
    "thus @xmath19 consists of @xmath4 forks that are piled in some sense .",
    "stretching each of the vertices on @xmath17 into an interval allows us to separate all forks in the @xmath20-projection .",
    "this is shown on the top left of figure  3 , for the case @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "\\(2 ) each fork can be split into @xmath24 forks with two teeth connecting a pair of stretched vertices , by a suitable isotopy .",
    "this is illustrated at the bottom of figure  3 , for a single fork with @xmath25 teeth .",
    "the resulting surface diagram is shown on the top right of figure  3 and can easily be identified as the canonical seifert surface associated with the braid @xmath1 .",
    "a first naive and false guess is that bipartite graph links are positive braid links .",
    "the bipartite graph knot depicted in figure  4 is obtained from the ribbon diagram of figure  1 by @xmath25 ribbon cuts .",
    "it is isotopic to the non - fibred positive twist knot @xmath26 , which is not a positive braid knot , since these are all fibred  @xcite .",
    "for the same reason , it is not possible to obtain the knot @xmath26 from any of the standard diagrams of the torus knot @xmath7 by smoothing any number of crossings .",
    "there is still a weaker notion of positivity inherited by bipartite graph links : strong quasipositivity . as many notions of positivity , strong quasipositivity was introduced by lee rudolph  @xcite .",
    "the definition of strong quasipositivity involves certain surfaces , altough it is an attribute for links .",
    "an embedded compact surface @xmath27 is called positive , if it is isotopic to an incompressible subsurface of the fibre surface of a positive torus link .",
    "here incompressibility simply means that the inclusion of @xmath28 into the fibre surface induces an injective map on the level of fundamental groups .",
    "a link in @xmath10 is called strongly quasipositive , if it is the boundary of a quasipositive surface .",
    "alternatively , quasipositive surfaces may be defined as legendrian ribbons with respect to the standard contact strucure on @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "as the name suggests , strongly quasipositive links include positive links .",
    "however , this is a non - trivial fact , due to rudolph  @xcite .    using either of the definitions , we immediately see that bipartite graph links are strongly quasipositive .",
    "indeed , all ribbon surfaces constructed above are incompressible subsurfaces of the ribbon surface associated with an embedded complete bipartite graph .",
    "the latter are fibre surfaces of torus links , since they are isotopic to the canonical seifert surfaces of these .    in order to show the converse , we need yet another desription of strongly quasipositive links , which is in fact the original one  @xcite .",
    "a link in @xmath10 is strongly quasipositive , if it is the closure of a strongly quasipositive braid @xmath29 in some braid group @xmath30 , i.e. a finite product of words of the form @xmath31 for @xmath32 .    for obvious reasons",
    ", we call the words @xmath33 generalised positive crossings ( see figure  5 ) . strongly quasipositive links bound canonical seifert surfaces made of one disc for each braid strand and one band for each generalised crossing",
    ".    a canonical surface is shown at the bottom right of figure  6 , for the braid @xmath34 . in that diagram",
    "all bands are represented by forks with two teeth . by looking at the whole sequence of diagrams of figure  6 , we realise that the ribbon surface of any embedded bipartite graph can be deformed into the canonical surface of a strongly quasipositive braid .",
    "note that forks consisting of one edge give no contribution to the canonical surface diagram , since the correponding ribbons can be removed by an isotopy .",
    "conversely , every canonical surface can be deformed into a bipartite graph surface by shrinking each braid strand to a point . in this way",
    "we obtain a bipartite graph where all points on the lower line @xmath18 have valency two .",
    "this proves theorem  1 .",
    "as we saw in the preceding section , there is a natural way of deforming the ribbon surface of an embedded bipartite graph @xmath19 into the canonical surface of a strongly quasipositive braid .",
    "the resulting braid is positive , if and only if all forks of @xmath19 are complete , meaning that their endpoints form sets of consecutive vertices of @xmath19 on the upper line ( as in figure  3 ) . by turning an embedded bipartite graph @xmath19 upside down",
    ", we obtain another embedded bipartite graph @xmath35 that gives rise to a different braid , in general .",
    "note that the forks of @xmath35 need not be complete , even if the ones of @xmath19 are .",
    "therefore we are not able to extend the duality on torus link diagrams to positive braids",
    ". however , we may define a duality on the more restricted class of twisted torus link diagrams . by the work of birman and kofman  @xcite ,",
    "these represent lorenz links .",
    "twisted torus links admit a natural description in terms of bipartite graphs .",
    "let @xmath36 be a finite decreasing sequence of natural numbers .",
    "we define an embedded bipartite graph @xmath37 with @xmath38 vertices on the upper line @xmath17 as a union of @xmath39 forks , where the @xmath40-th fork has the first @xmath41 points on @xmath17 as endpoints ( see figure  7 for an illustration ) . braid diagrams associated with graphs of type @xmath37 are precisely twisted torus link diagrams . turning @xmath37",
    "upside down gives rise to a dual graph @xmath42 with @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "in fact , thinking of the numbers @xmath45 as the coefficients of a young diagram , the numbers @xmath46 correspond to the dual young diagram . for example , the dual graph of @xmath47 is @xmath48 .",
    "the same involution has been described by birman and kofman ( @xcite , corollary  4 ) and , in terms of lorenz links , by dehornoy ( @xcite , proposition  1.18 . ) . within the framework of bipartite graphs ,",
    "it is not hard to figure out a duality on an even larger class of diagrams .",
    "torus links are prototypes of links associated with isolated singularities of complex plane curves .",
    "classically , the torus link @xmath5 is defined as the intersection of the singular curve @xmath49 with the unit @xmath50-sphere @xmath51 .",
    "a generic deformation of that curve will transform it into a smooth one , e.g. @xmath52 , @xmath53 $ ] .",
    "carefully chosen deformations may give rise to simpler singularities , e.g. @xmath54 , @xmath53 $ ] , where @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "after a suitable biholomorphic coordinate change around @xmath57 , the singularity @xmath54 becomes @xmath58 , provided @xmath59 .",
    "formally , a deformation of a singularity of @xmath60 $ ] at @xmath57 is a polynomial in three variables @xmath61 with the following properties :    1 .",
    "@xmath62 ; 2 .   for all @xmath53 $ ]",
    ", the restriction @xmath63 has an isolated singularity at @xmath57 ; 3 .   for all @xmath64 $ ] , the singularity of @xmath65 at @xmath66 is equivalent to the singularity of @xmath67 at @xmath66 ( via a local biholomorphic coordinate change ) .",
    "we say that the singularity of @xmath67 at @xmath66 is adjacent to the singularity of @xmath68 , as well as their links . for more details on versal deformations and adjacency of singularities",
    ", we refer the reader to siersma s dissertation  @xcite .",
    "an explicit solution to the adjacency problem is not known , not even for singularities of type @xmath69 .",
    "let us note that the link @xmath70 is adjacent to @xmath5 , provided @xmath55 , @xmath56 . however , this is not a necessary condition .",
    "for example , the links @xmath71 are adjacent to @xmath7 , for all @xmath72 ( these are the only ones , apart from @xmath73 , for genus reasons ) . more generally , for @xmath74 with @xmath75 , the function @xmath76 exhibits a deformation of the singularity @xmath77 into @xmath78 .",
    "this surprisingly easy deformation was found by peter feller , based upon ideas of ishikawa , nguyen and oka  @xcite .",
    "the verification requires basic knowledge about newton polygons .",
    "substituting @xmath79 transforms @xmath80 into @xmath81 ; the latter is equivalent to @xmath82 , provided @xmath75 .    in this section",
    "we propose a combinatorial notion of adjacency for bipartite graph links , motivated by the above list of algebraic adjacencies . a complete bipartite graph of type @xmath6 consists of @xmath3 forks with @xmath4 teeth . given a fork @xmath83 and two natural numbers @xmath84 with @xmath85 ,",
    "let us define a splitting of @xmath83 by assembling the first @xmath38 and the last @xmath86 endpoints of @xmath83 into two forks @xmath87 , @xmath88 , respectively ( see figure  8) . on the level of braid diagrams , this is simply smoothing a crossing .",
    "we say that an embedded bipartite graph @xmath19 is adjacent to @xmath6 , if it is obtained from @xmath6 by a finite number of fork splittings , where splittings may be applied to up- and down - pointing forks , possibly with iteration ( see figure  2 ) .",
    "the corresponding link @xmath21 is called combinatorially adjacent to @xmath5 . as a first example",
    ", we note that the torus link @xmath70 is combinatorially adjacent to @xmath5 , provided @xmath55 , @xmath56 ( this is most easily seen in two steps , via @xmath89 resp .",
    "@xmath90 ) .",
    "a more interesting splitting is shown in figure  8 ; it shows that @xmath91 is combinatorially adjacent to @xmath7 .",
    "this is a special case of the following fact : for @xmath74 , @xmath75 , the torus link @xmath92 is obtained from @xmath93 by smoothing an appropriate set of crossings , @xmath94 in number ( see  @xcite , proposition  1 , and figure  9 for @xmath95 and @xmath96 ) .",
    "this is the combinatorial counterpart to the above statement on algebraic adjacencies .",
    "the exciting thing about combinatorial adjacency is that it allows smoothings of crossings in the two standard diagrams of torus links simultaneously .",
    "as we just observed , there is a big overlap between algebraic and combinatorial adjacency , where both notions apply .",
    "we do not know whether this is more than a pure coincidence .",
    "the following question should nevertheless be justified : for which @xmath97 is @xmath70 combinatorially adjacent to @xmath5 ?",
    "let @xmath98 be an embedded bipartite graph with @xmath99 vertices .",
    "we define the density of @xmath19 as @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the number of edges of @xmath19 .",
    "this carries over to bipartite graph links @xmath18 , by taking the supremum over all bipartite graph representatives for @xmath18 : @xmath102    1 .",
    "the supremum is actually a maximum , i.e. there exists an embedded bipartite graph @xmath19 with @xmath103 , + 2 .",
    "@xmath104 , for all bipartite graph knots @xmath105 , where @xmath106 and @xmath107 denote the braid index and the maximal euler characteristic of the knot @xmath105 , respectively .",
    "+      let @xmath19 be an embedded bipartite graph representative for @xmath18 .",
    "the corresponding ribbon surface @xmath109 is a seifert surface of maximal euler characteristic for the link @xmath18 , by bennequin s inequality  @xcite : @xmath110 . in terms of @xmath19 , we compute @xmath111 thus @xmath112 this implies the second item of the proposition , since @xmath113 and @xmath107 is non - positive for knots ( except for the trivial knot , for which the statement is true anyway ) .",
    "choose @xmath114 so that @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "if @xmath117 then @xmath118 therefore , in order to come close to @xmath119 , the graph @xmath19 must satisfy @xmath120 .",

    "the restriction to knots of braid index at least @xmath50 is only for the sake of simplicity of the statement ; special alternating knots of braid index @xmath123 are torus links of type @xmath71 , @xmath124 .",
    "let @xmath125 be represented by an embedded bipartite graph @xmath126 . if @xmath127 then @xmath128 , since the only alternating torus knots are @xmath71 , @xmath129 , and @xmath7",
    ". suppose , for contradiction , that @xmath130 . then the graph @xmath19 has more than @xmath131 edges ( in particular , one of the numbers @xmath132 is at least @xmath133 ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath19 contains a complete bipartite graph of type @xmath134 as a subgraph .",
    "indeed , if no @xmath135-bipartite subgraph of @xmath19 was complete , then @xmath136 . in terms of seifert surfaces",
    ", this means that the ribbon surface @xmath137 associated with @xmath19 contains the fibre surface of the torus link @xmath138 as an incompressible subsurface .",
    "a direct computation , carried out in  @xcite , shows that the symmetrised seifert matrix of the fibre surface of @xmath138 has non - maximal signature ( @xmath139 ) .",
    "this fact descends to the surface @xmath137 , since maximality of the signature is preserved under taking minors of symmetric matrices .",
    "we conclude @xmath140 where @xmath141 denotes the genus of the knot @xmath105 . on the other hand , since @xmath105 is positive , its rasmussen invariant @xmath142 coincides with twice the genus : @xmath143 . but",
    "@xmath105 is also alternating , so @xmath144 , a contradiction ( see  @xcite for the last two facts ) .",
    "a careful generalisation of the above proof shows that a large density implies @xmath145 .",
    "the reader might suspect there is a kind of converse , i.e. a small density implies @xmath146 .",
    "however , this is not true , as shows the following example .",
    "let @xmath147 and let @xmath148 be the embedded bipartite subgraph obtained from the complete bipartite graph @xmath149 by the extension shown in figure  10 , for @xmath150 .",
    "we observe that @xmath151 is a knot of genus @xmath152 . a direct computation yields @xmath153 , thus @xmath154 ( this is due to the fact that the torus link @xmath155 has non - maximal signature ) .",
    "moreover , the braid index of @xmath156 grows linearly in @xmath39 , similarly as for twist knots with increasing twist number .",
    "this follows for example from the inequality of morton and franks - williams  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "the inequality of proposition  1 implies @xmath157      the proof of proposition  2 suggests to study bipartite graph links via graph minor theory . for example , we may ask if there exist finitely many embedded bipartite graphs @xmath158 such that the following holds : the signature of a bipartite graph knot @xmath125 is maximal , @xmath159 , if and only if @xmath19 contains none of the graphs @xmath160 as embedded minors ."
