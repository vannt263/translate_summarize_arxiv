    "adsorption of unsaturated hydrocarbon molecules on si surfaces is of great importance to investigate the initial - stage growth of sic films on si substrates . in particular",
    ", there is an increasing interest in the study of adsorption of two basic hydrocarbon units , namely acetylene ( c@xmath0h@xmath0 ) and ethylene ( c@xmath0h@xmath2 ) , on si(100 ) surfaces .",
    "@xcite acetylene , due to its reactive triple bond , has a high probability of interacting with the surface si dangling bonds , undergoing electronic rehybridization and sticking to the surface .",
    "adsorption of acetylene on si(100 ) represents a promising carbon source for homoepitaxial growth of cubic sic because the processing temperature can be reduced well below 1000 @xmath3c , thus making it compatible with the present silicon technologies .",
    "in fact , at temperatures as high as 600 @xmath3c , acetylene already decomposes , leading to desorption of hydrogen and the formation of sic clusters on the si(100 ) surface .",
    "furthermore , the diffusion of a small concentration of carbon atoms into the si substrate may form a substoichiometric alloy with interesting ir optical properties .    for the adsorption of acetylene on si(100 ) , as in the case of ethylene , most of the experimental and theoretical studies support the `` di-@xmath4 '' model , in which the acetylene molecule is adsorbed across a first - layer si dimer in a _",
    "( b ) site , with the si dimers preserved ( i.e. not cleaved ) upon adsorption .",
    "evidence favoring the b adsorption site comes from different experiments,@xcite based on high - resolution electron - energy - loss spectroscopy , low - energy electron diffraction , x - ray photoemission spectroscopy , near - edge x - ray - adsorption fine structure , scanning tunnelling microscopy , photoelectron diffraction , and from theoretical calculations.@xcite    recently , however , this scenario has been challenged by xu _",
    "et al._,@xcite who studied the adsorption of ethylene and acetylene on the si(100 ) surface by using a photoelectron holographic imaging technique . the most surprising result of this study was the observation of a new preferred adsorption site for acetylene on si(100 ) , where the molecule is bonded to four silicon atoms , in a _ pedestal _ configuration ( p ) between two adjacent si dimers .",
    "this so - called `` tetra-@xmath4 '' model seems to be consistent also with high - resolution photoemission data.@xcite    by analyzing their diffraction images , xu _ et al .",
    "_ infer a c - c distance in adsorbed acetylene of @xmath5  . even taking into account the indeterminacy associated to this estimate ( which",
    ", according to the authors , could be as large as 0.2  ) , this represents another surprising result .",
    "in fact this value is comparable with the experimental bond length of the triple c - c bond in the free acetylene molecule ( 1.21  ) , whereas , for the @xmath6-hybridized acetylene adsorbed in the p site , one would expect a much longer bond , close to the single c - c bond of , say , c@xmath0h@xmath7 ( 1.54  ) .",
    "another somewhat controversial issue concerns the c@xmath0h@xmath0 equilibrium coverage which is most likely to be realized on the si surface . based on experimental measurements , both 0.5 monolayer ( ml ) and",
    "1 ml coverages have been proposed as saturation coverages realized , in equilibrium conditions , on the si(100 ) surface ( 1 ml means that as many c@xmath0h@xmath0 molecules are adsorbed as si surface dimers ) .",
    "in particular , stm experiments performed at room temperature indicate@xcite that the c@xmath0h@xmath0 molecules form a local @xmath8 or @xmath9 structure with a saturation coverage of 0.5 ml .",
    "detailed analysis of the stm images reveals lack of adsorption on nearest - neighbor sites , thus showing that the c@xmath0h@xmath0 molecules adsorb on alternate dimers : the two observed surface periodicities depend on whether the c@xmath0h@xmath0 molecules adsorbed on adjacent rows are in phase or out of phase . on the other hand kinetic uptake measurements,@xcite performed at lower temperatures ( 105 k ) ,",
    "provide evidence for 1 ml coverage , i.e. each si dimer site adsorbs a single c@xmath0h@xmath0 molecule .",
    "these different experimental observations have been tentatively explained@xcite by assuming that the early stages of acetylene chemisorption are kinetically rather than thermodynamically driven , i.e. adsorption proceeds via precursor states,@xcite which although not truly thermodynamically stable states , are separated by sizeable potential barrier from the stable adsorption configurations .",
    "the process of thermal desorption of acetylene on si(100 ) is also of interest .",
    "it has been found@xcite that , as the surface temperature is raised up to 870 k , the acetylene molecules dissociate , leading to the formation of sih groups and surface carbon .",
    "however , the details of the dissociation paths and the early stages of surface carbonization are not known .",
    "simulations performed using ab - initio finite - temperature molecular dynamics can provide valuable information to elucidate such complex phenomena .    in order to clarify the above issues , we have performed a full _ ab initio _ study of acetylene adsorption on si(100 ) , by using the car - parrinello approach.@xcite    the paper is organized as follows . in section ii we describe the computational method .",
    "we report our results for the adsorption geometries , with particular emphasis on the energetic and structural characterization of the b and p configurations , in section iiia . in section iiib",
    "we address the problem of the theoretical determination of the c@xmath0h@xmath0 equilibrium coverage .",
    "our calculations of the surface formation energies for different model structures at 0.5 and 1 ml coverage provide evidence that the saturation coverage depends on temperature , largely favoring the 1 ml coverage , but indicating the existence , for a particular adsorption configuration , of a narrow window in temperature ( which we find only qualitatively in agreement with the experiment ) , where the 0.5 ml coverage may become favored .",
    "we offer this prediction , which disagrees with the conclusions of ref .",
    ", as a semi - quantitative explanation for the different experimental observations quoted above .",
    "finally , in section iv we present the results of our simulations of thermal dissociation of c@xmath0h@xmath0 on si(100 ) ; this is a very important topic being related with the process of growth of sic films obtained from decomposition of acetylene chemisorbed on the si(100 ) surface .",
    "our results are encouraging and show some interesting behavior , including a tendency of the acetylene molecules to decompose into intact c dimers , which diffuse below the si surface layer and bind themselves to form more complex structures .",
    "total - energy calculations and molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations have been carried out within the car - parrinello approach@xcite in the framework of the density functional theory , both in the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) and using gradient corrections in the blyp implementation.@xcite gradient - corrected functionals have been adopted in the most recent theoretical studies of adsorption of organic molecules on si(100 ) because they are typically more accurate than the lsda functional in describing chemical processes on the si(100 ) surface@xcite .",
    "the calculations have been carried out considering the @xmath10-point only of the brillouin zone ( bz ) , and using norm - conserving pseudopotentials,@xcite with @xmath11 and @xmath12 nonlocality for c and si .",
    "wavefunctions were expanded in plane waves with an energy cutoff of 50 ry .",
    "we have explicitly checked that , at this value of the energy cutoff , the structural and binding properties of our system are well converged .    in order to test the above approximations ,",
    "we have calculated the structural and vibrational properties of the free acetylene molecule ( see table [ c2h2 ] ) and find an excellent agreement with the experimental estimates and previous theoretical calculations.@xcite    the si(100 ) surface is modeled with a periodically repeated slab of 5 si layers and a vacuum region of 7    ( tests have been also carried out with a vacuum region of 10  , without any significant change in the results ) .",
    "a monolayer of hydrogen atoms is used to saturate the dangling bonds on the lower surface of the slab .",
    "we have used a @xmath13 surface supercell in the @xmath14 reconstruction , corresponding to 16 si atoms / layer ( some calculations have been performed using instead a @xmath15 reconstruction , see section iiib ) .",
    "with such a relatively large supercell we expect that a sampling of the bz limited to the @xmath10 point is adequate .",
    "a sensitive test for the adequacy of the @xmath16-point sampling is provided by the study of the clean si(100 ) surface : as discussed below , the correct surface structure is obtained with our supercell .",
    "structural relaxations of the ionic coordinates are performed using the method of direct inversion in the iterative subspace.@xcite during ionic relaxations and md simulations the lowest si layer and the saturation hydrogens are kept fixed .",
    "we verified that , by starting with the unreconstructed , clean si(100 ) surface , the structural optimization procedure correctly produces asymmetric surface dimers , with a dimer bond length and buckling angle in good agreement with previous , highly converged _ ab initio _",
    "calculations.@xcite acetylene molecules are added on top of the slab and the system is then fully relaxed towards the minimum energy configuration . to better explore the complex potential energy surface of this system , in most of the cases the optimization procedure was repeated using a simulated - annealing strategy and also starting from different initial configurations .",
    "the same optimization procedure has been already successfully applied to the study of adsorption of benzene on si(100).@xcite    among the many possible adsorption configurations@xcite for acetylene on si(100 ) we have focused our study on the b and p structures ( those involved in the present controversy about the lowest - energy site ) , although calculations have been performed for other configurations as well .",
    "adsorption of acetylene between two adjacent dimer rows is not considered in our calculations , since it is known to result in structures having much lower binding energies.@xcite",
    "four possible configurations of acetylene adsorbed on si(100 ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ conf ] ; the energetics and the structural properties are summarized in table [ data ] . when comparing the total energies of different adsorption configurations , we consider a representative 0.5 ml coverage of acetylene on si(100 ) , corresponding to two si dimers per c@xmath0h@xmath0 molecule .",
    "this is the coverage realized in the experiments by xu _",
    "et al._,@xcite and the one which is likely to be prevailing at room temperature .",
    "note that calculations performed at lower coverage ( for instance at 0.125 ml coverage , corresponding , in our supercell , to a single acetylene molecule adsorbed on the slab ) do not alter the conclusions contained in table [ data ] , as far as the energetic ordering of the structures is concerned .",
    "we confirm that both the p and b structure are possible adsorption configurations , and that the si dimers involved in bonding with acetylene are preserved ( in line with the most recent experimental and theoretical works , see refs . and further references quoted therein ) , although the typical buckling of the ( 2@xmath171 ) reconstruction is removed and the si dimers become symmetric ( this latter result is also in agreement with previous calculations , see , for instance , ref . ) .",
    "according to our data the p structure , however , lies at much higher energy than the b one .",
    "interestingly , a lower - energy pedestal configuration ( p@xmath18 ) is obtained by rotating the p structure by 90@xmath19 with respect to the si surface . in this configuration , the four c - si bonds are shorter than in the p one .",
    "however , p@xmath18 is also found to be less favored than b. if the b structure is rotated by 90@xmath19 , in such a way to bridge two si atoms of two adjacent dimers , one obtains another possible adsorption configuration , b@xmath18 , slightly higher in energy than b. our results compare favorably with those of the recent paper by sorescu and jordan,@xcite where however the adsorption energies for the b and b@xmath18 structures at 0.5 ml coverage are not reported .",
    "we also find that , at higher coverage , the b@xmath18 structure becomes favored with respect to the b one ( the energy difference is @xmath20 and 0.19 ev / molecule , using the lsda and blyp functional , respectively ) , again in agreement with the calculations of sorescu and jordan.@xcite    as can be seen in table [ data ] , use of blyp gradient corrections instead of lsda makes bond lengths about 1 - 2 % longer ; moreover the p@xmath18 configuration is much less energetically favored , and the b and b@xmath18 structures are almost degenerate .",
    "note however that the energetic ordering of the four different structures remains unchanged .",
    "our results contradict the findings of xu _",
    "et al._@xcite that the p site is the _",
    "stable _ adsorption site , and confirm instead the conclusions reported in the previous literature . for the b configuration , which is certainly the favored one at coverages not higher than 0.5 ml , our structural parameters are in excellent agreement both with the experimental estimates of matsui _",
    "et al._@xcite ( c - c bond length=@xmath21  ) and terborg _ et al._@xcite ( c - c bond length=@xmath22  , c - si bond length=@xmath23  ) , and with the most recent theoretical calculations.@xcite    in the b structure our optimized c - c bond length ( 1.35 - 1.36  ) is close to that of ethylene ( 1.33  ) , suggesting @xmath24 rehybridization of the c - c bond . @xmath24 bonding is supported by imamura",
    "_ et al._,@xcite who reported charge - density plots where the characteristic @xmath25-bonds are observed , and by matsui _ et al._,@xcite who observe @xmath26 features in near edge x - ray adsorption fine structure spectra .",
    "our computed vibrational frequency of the c - c stretching mode is 1440 @xmath27 , which compares favorably both with the experimental value of huang _ et al._@xcite ( estimated to be in the range 1450 - 1500 @xmath27 ) and with the previous ab - initio estimate by imamura _ et al._@xcite ( 1479 @xmath27 ) .",
    "note that , as expected , the c - c bond length in the p and p@xmath18 structures is significantly larger than in the b one , and is not consistent with the value , @xmath28  , observed by xu _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that , either the experimental indeterminacy associated to the c - c bond length is largely underestimated , or the structure observed by xu _ et al . _",
    "is not a pedestal one .",
    "for the b structure , again at 0.5 ml coverage , our computed adsorption energy ( 78 kcal / mol using lsda , 65 kcal / mol with blyp ) is in good agreement with previous theoretical estimates@xcite ( ranging from 55 to 77 kcal / mol ) .",
    "the substantial energy difference between the bridge ( b , b@xmath18 ) structures and the pedestal ( p , p@xmath18 ) ones strongly supports the conclusion that the bridge adsorption sites are the _ stable _ configuration for acetylene on si(100 ) , while the pedestal structures can represent only _ metastable _ adsorption sites .    other possible adsorption structures exist , besides those shown in fig .",
    "[ conf ] ( see also ref . ) .",
    "for instance , we found a `` diagonal - bridge '' ( db ) configuration in which the acetylene molecule forms a cross - bridge structure with two si atoms belonging to two neighbour si dimers of the same row .",
    "this configuration can occur as one considers reconstructions of the si surface involving alternating buckled si dimers , such as the @xmath8 and the @xmath9 .",
    "however , according both to our calculations and to those of sorescu and jordan,@xcite the db structure is even energetically less favored than the p@xmath18 one .",
    "having assessed the quality of our approach by comparing our structural and energetical data with previous theoretical and experimental studies , we are now in the position to deal with the issue of saturation coverage , where a high accuracy is essential to get meaningful information .",
    "stm measurements@xcite of c@xmath0h@xmath0 on si(100 ) , performed at room temperature , indicate a saturation coverage of 0.5 ml ( one acetylene molecule adsorbed every two si surface dimers ) .",
    "however , other experimental measurements@xcite suggest instead a saturation coverage of 1.0 ml . we show in the following that , although the 1.0 ml coverage seems to be generally preferred , in principle both coverages can be realized depending on the temperature of c@xmath0h@xmath0 deposition and on the adsorption configuration .    the 0.5 ml coverage can be realized in a number of ways , even assuming that each of the acetylene molecule is adsorbed in the lowest energy structure , i.e. the b structure ( see fig . [ conftanida ] ) . in particular ,",
    "as shown in the following , the relative energy ordering is influenced by the structure of the si dimers which are not saturated by c@xmath0h@xmath0 molecules .",
    "these may be characterized by a different relative buckling orientation . here",
    "we adopt the same notation used in ref . to identify these different structures .",
    "the full monolayer ( 1 ml ) coverage , on the contrary , is compatible only with a single configuration if the acetylene molecules are adsorbed in the b structure .",
    "using first - principles calculations tanida _ et al._@xcite predict , for the most stable 0.5 ml coverage structure , one ( structure ( a ) in fig .",
    "[ conftanida ] ) where alternated dimer rows are fully covered with c@xmath0h@xmath0 molecules .",
    "however such structure is not compatible with the stm observations of ref .",
    ", performed at room temperature . according to these observations , at 0.5 ml coverage",
    "the acetylene molecules are instead adsorbed on alternate dimers in the same rows , and on adjacent rows they can be in phase or out of phase .",
    "note that instead the ( c)-(f ) configurations , which are characterized by @xmath29 or @xmath15 periodicity , are all compatible with the stm observations of ref . .",
    "using the blyp functional we confirm ( see table [ data ] ) the result of ref . that the ( a ) structure is at the lowest energy .",
    "however , at variance with ref . , we find that the ( a ) , ( c ) , and ( e ) structures are almost degenerate in energy .",
    "this discrepancy could be due to the fact that tanida _",
    "et al._@xcite use a smaller cell than ours and possibly to the different gradient - corrected functional they adopt .",
    "note that in this case the effect of the gradient corrections is not a simple quantitative correction to the lsda results ; in fact using the blyp functional the energetic ordering of the different configurations is completely changed ( see table [ data ] ) .    at thermal equilibrium",
    "the optimal surface structure can be determined by computing the grand canonical potential.@xcite we show in fig . [ coverage1 ] , for the structures ( a ) and ( e ) of fig .",
    "[ conftanida ] , the behavior of @xmath30 , that is the difference between the grand canonical potential of a given structure and that of the clean si(100 ) surface .",
    "@xmath30 is defined@xcite as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the difference between the total energy of the considered structure and that of the clean si(100 ) surface ( using the lowest - energy surface reconstruction which is compatible with the given configuration , that is @xmath15 for configuration ( a ) and @xmath14 for configuration ( e ) , respectively ) , and @xmath33 is the number of the c@xmath0h@xmath0 molecules ; following ref .",
    "the zero of the chemical potential @xmath34 is assumed to be 1/3 of the energy of the isolated benzene ( c@xmath7h@xmath7 ) molecule in vacuum .",
    "calculations were performed using the blyp gradient - corrected functional .",
    "as can be seen , for structure ( a ) the preferred saturation coverage appears to be 1.0 ml , in agreement with the findings of tanida _",
    "et al._;@xcite and the same is true for the structures ( b ) , ( c ) , ( d ) , and ( f ) ( the corresponding @xmath35 curves are not shown because they closely resemble those of structure ( a ) ) . however , in the configuration ( e ) , there is instead a range of values of the chemical potential for which the 0.5 ml saturation coverage becomes favored .",
    "note that , considering the adsorption structure b@xmath18 in place of b , the 1.0 ml saturation coverage would be always favored , since this structure is the preferred one at high coverage ( see previous discussion ) .",
    "configuration ( e ) , with a @xmath1 periodicity , is compatible with stm measurements at room temperature and , according to our calculations ( see table [ data ] ) , is also one of the lowest - energy configurations at zero temperature , being almost degenerate with configuration ( a ) ; since it is the only structure for which the 0.5 ml coverage could be favored instead of the 1.0 ml coverage , we have tried to estimate in which range of temperatures this particular configuration is stable .",
    "to this aim we have followed the procedure described in ref . .",
    "the surface formation energy , whose minimum determines the equilibrium state of the surface as a function of composition , is defined as @xmath36 , @xmath37 being the surface area and    @xmath38    is the grand canonical potential ( we have omitted a @xmath39 term which , for the pressures considered here , is negligible ) .",
    "@xmath40 is the free energy of the system , @xmath41 is the number of particles of type @xmath42 , and @xmath43 denote the chemical potentials of the various components .",
    "if one assumes that the si(100 ) surface is in equilibrium with bulk si ( this is the natural reservoir for si atoms , due to the presence of steps , terraces and other surface defects ) , then for the bare si(100 ) surface one has :    @xmath44 -n_{\\rm si}e_{\\rm bulk}[{\\rm si}]\\;,\\ ] ]    where the first term is the total energy of the slab and the second term is the energy per atom of bulk si multiplied by the total number of si atoms of the cell . in the above expression the temperature dependence of the free energy of the slab and that of the bulk reservoir have been neglected ,",
    "as usually done in this kind of calculations.@xcite the formation energy of the acetylene - covered surface can be estimated , following the same reasoning , by computing    @xmath45 -n_{\\rm si}e_{\\rm bulk}[{\\rm si } ] -n_{_{{\\rm c}_2{\\rm h}_2}}\\mu_{_{{\\rm c}_2{\\rm h}_2}}(t ) + f_{\\rm ads}(t)\\;,\\ ] ]    where @xmath46 is the free - energy contribution due to the vibrations of the adsorbed c@xmath0h@xmath0 molecules . in order to estimate the temperature dependence of @xmath34 we assume ,",
    "quite reasonably , that the surface is in equilibrium with a reservoir of acetylene molecules in the gas phase . therefore , using elementary statistical mechanics,@xcite    @xmath47    here @xmath48 is the total energy of the isolated acetylene molecule , @xmath49 is the pressure , and @xmath50 is the quantum volume .",
    "the rotational and vibrational contribution to the chemical potential are calculated using the experimental values of the vibrational frequencies for the free acetylene molecule.@xcite we estimate the pressure @xmath49 from realistic growth conditions of c@xmath0h@xmath0 films on si(100 ) : experimentally@xcite the saturation coverage is realized under an acetylene exposure of @xmath51 l , which corresponds to @xmath52 torr .",
    "the vibrational contribution @xmath53 $ ] is estimated from the vibrational frequencies calculated in ref .",
    "( the frequencies of the hindered modes,@xcite t@xmath54 , t@xmath55 and r@xmath56 , which are not included among the mode frequencies reported in ref . , have been estimated here by using a `` frozen - phonon '' approach ) .",
    "our calculations show that , in the temperature range from 410 to 460 k , the adsorption configuration ( e ) at 0.5 ml coverage is energetically favored with respect to that corresponding to 1 ml coverage .",
    "since this temperature interval is not far from room temperature ( given the approximations involved in our derivation the accuracy of our temperature estimate is of course limited ) we conclude that configuration ( e ) could be realized as a stable adsorption configuration at room temperature .",
    "this result , which disagrees with the conclusions of tanida _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ( according to ref .",
    "the 0.5 ml coverage is never favored ) , is in qualitative agreement with the experimental observation@xcite that full monolayer coverage is realized at @xmath57 k , while the 0.5 coverage is observed in stm experiments,@xcite performed at room temperature . of course",
    "this does not rule out the possibility that the existence of precursor states@xcite could play a crucial role in destabilizing the surface species for coverages greater than 0.5 ml ; however it offers an alternative / complementary explanation of the experimental findings .      as a result of the high desorption activation energy of c@xmath0h@xmath0 on si(100 ) ,",
    "adsorbed acetylene molecules tend to be retained on the surface up to relatively high temperatures . according to the eels and leed measurements of nishijima _",
    "et al._,@xcite upon heating the c@xmath0h@xmath0-exposed si(100 ) surface from 80 up to 750 k , the c - h bond scission occurs , with a gradual recombination of the dissociated h atoms onto the si(100 ) surface ; the c - c bond scission takes place by further heating the sample at 870 k , while by heating up to 930 k the surface hydrogen is probably completely removed by h@xmath0 desorption ; similar qualitative results have been obtained in theoretical calculations by zhou et al.@xcite    the proposed@xcite decomposition path is therefore : c@xmath0h@xmath0 @xmath58 c@xmath0h@xmath54 ( @xmath59=0,1 ) @xmath58 c @xmath58 @xmath60-sic ; the activation barrier for the dissociation of a single h atom is estimated@xcite to be no less than 0.8 ev , while that for the the dissociation of the remaining c@xmath0 species is about 1.3 ev .",
    "this indicates that acetylene favors dehydrogenation to c@xmath0h@xmath54 ( @xmath59=0,1 ) species first ; then the remaining c@xmath0 dimers further decompose into c species to form @xmath60-sic films .",
    "however it is not at all clear@xcite if , after acetylene dehydrogenation , all the h atoms desorb as a gas of h@xmath0 molecules or if instead some of them actually form si - h bonds .",
    "also the weakening of the si dimer bonds , as a consequence of heating the sample , could be relevant : according to imamura et al .",
    ", @xcite although the dimerized structure is more stable than the dimer - cleaved one , the latter structure may be taken instantaneously just after the adsorption , and the si - si bond - breaking and rebonding oscillations could occur at relatively high temperatures .",
    "finally , in view of the sic - growth characterization , it would be very interesting to clarify how , after acetylene dissociation , carbon atoms diffuse into the bulk of the si crystal .",
    "we have performed car - parrinello md simulations at finite temperature in order to investigate the dissociation of acetylene on si(100 ) .",
    "the ionic degrees of freedom have been integrated using a time step of 5 a.u .",
    "( @xmath61 fs ) and typical md runs were 3 - 4 ps long .",
    "we start with a configuration where the c@xmath0h@xmath0 molecules are adsorbed on the si(100)@xmath14 surface in the b structure at 0.5 ml coverage .",
    "the initial geometry is optimized using the method described in section ii .",
    "we gradually heat this structure by simply rescaling the ionic velocities .",
    "obviously we are forced to use heating rates much higher than in actual experiments in order to let the system undergo some kind of transformations ; this however would lead to melting of the whole sample prior to c@xmath0h@xmath0 desorption / decomposition . in order to overcome this unphysical effect , we have adopted a simple @xmath62-dependent heating scheme , in which the temperature decreases as one moves towards the interior of the slab . in this way the adsorbed acetylene molecules and the uppermost si atoms are kept at higher temperatures than the remaining ions , thus avoiding melting of the whole slab .",
    "although both in the simulations and in actual experiments the details of the heating procedure may significantly affect the final system configuration , we believe that our scheme is able to reproduce , at least at a qualitative level , the basic features of the desorption process .",
    "the main results of our md simulations can be summarized as follows ( given the heating procedure followed , our `` simulation temperature '' is not particularly meaningful for comparison with the experimental one ) : 1 ) by heating the sample the first relevant event is the dissociation of some c - h bonds ( typically one h atom is detached from every molecule ) ; 2 ) then c - si bonds are continously broken and reformed leading to diffusion of the acetylene molecules on the si surface ; 3 ) by further increase in the temperature , some c@xmath0h@xmath0 molecules loose their h atoms , remaining on the surface as c - c dimers ; 4 ) these dimers remain intact even at very high temperatures ; 5 ) the dissociated h atoms prefer to form new bonds with si atoms rather than forming h@xmath0 molecules , although in our simulation this tendency could be enhanced by the finite size of the vacuum region ; 6 ) the c - c dimers eventually form complex sub - surface structures , just below the first si layer , such as a 5-atom ring composed by one si atom and 4 c atoms .",
    "some of the above results are consistent with experimental observations .",
    "in fact , in the early stages of annealing , a strong si - h stretching mode is visible in the hreels spectrum,@xcite thus supporting the formation of si - h bonds , while the peak due to c - c stretching broadens and develops a long tail ; this latter result could indicate that breaking of c - c dimers could be only partial or / and much slower than h dissociation .",
    "the surprising stability of c - c dimers has been confirmed by using different heating rates and also adopting the lsda functional instead of blyp .",
    "this remarkable effect is in contrast with previously proposed desorption mechanisms which just assume a simple c - c dimer thermal breaking ( see for instance ref . ) .",
    "note that the same result has been obtained by cicero _",
    "et al._@xcite from simulations in which they studied the heating of carbon dimers adsorbed on si(100 ) .",
    "this however poses the problem of how sic ( whose formation is believed to require breaking of c - c dimers ) is actually produced .",
    "a possible explanation could be the presence , in real experiments , of a gas of silanes ( such as si@xmath0h@xmath7 ) which could play a crucial role@xcite in the sic growth : in fact adsorbed si atoms can react with the c@xmath0h@xmath0 molecules , and c - c dimer breaking could actually occur before acetylene adsorption .",
    "adsorption of acetylene on si(100 ) has been investigated using _",
    "ab initio _ simulations . the structural and energetic properties of possible adsorption configurations have been studied .",
    "although the p structure , recently suggested by xu _ et al . _ as the lowest - energy configuration , is found to be stable , our results show that the bridge structures ( b or b@xmath18 , depending on the coverage ) are energetically favored , in agreement with most of the previous studies .",
    "the results reported by xu _ et al . _ could be influenced by the presence of defects , such as steps , which could make the actual si surface used in their experiment substantially different from the ideal si(100 ) surface assumed ( see fig .",
    "2 of ref . ) in the interpretation of the experimental data .",
    "we have then addressed the issue of the saturation coverage and its dependence on the temperature , and we find that , although the full monolayer coverage is generally preferred , there is a temperature window , not far from room temperature , in which a particular adsorption structure at 0.5 ml coverage is preferred .",
    "this could explain the results of stm observations performed at room temperature .",
    "the effects of including gradient corrections have been also discussed : our calculations show that these effects are particularly relevant for the determination of the optimal adsorption configuration at 0.5 ml coverage , where even fine structural details , such as the relative orientation of the buckled si - dimers , may be important for the correct determination of the surface formation energies .",
    "finally we have reported the results of our md simulations of the thermal decomposition process of acetylene molecules on si(100 ) ; in particular we observe a surprising stability of the ( dehydrogenated ) c dimers and their tendency to diffuse below the first si layer and to coalesce into more complex c fragments .",
