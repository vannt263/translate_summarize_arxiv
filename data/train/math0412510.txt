    "in  @xcite , a short proof was given of the fundamental result of harris  @xcite and kesten  @xcite that the critical probability @xmath1 for bond percolation in the planar square lattice @xmath2 is equal to @xmath0 , where @xmath3 is the critical probability for the occurrence of percolation ( see below ) , and @xmath2 is the graph with vertex set @xmath2 in which vertices are adjacent if and only if they are at euclidean distance @xmath4 . the methods used in  @xcite were developed in  @xcite to prove the new result that the critical probability for percolation in random plane voronoi tilings is also @xmath0 .",
    "here we show that the same methods easily give exponential decay of the volume below the critical probability . furthermore , while the arguments in  @xcite are written specifically for bond percolation in @xmath2 , they can also be applied in many other planar contexts .",
    "we illustrate this by considering several examples .",
    "we start with two well - known ones , site percolation in the square and triangular lattices .",
    "next , we consider a new bond percolation model in the square lattice , where the states of the edges are not independent , showing that an analogue of the harris - kesten result holds in this context",
    ". finally , we study random discrete voronoi percolation in the plane .",
    "it is very likely that the methods of  @xcite and  @xcite can be applied to many other percolation models .",
    "in the rest of this introduction we shall recall some of the fundamental concepts of percolation theory . then , in section  [ sec_prelim ] , we present the basic tools we shall use to prove our results . in section  [ bdecay ] we show that the method of  @xcite easily extends to prove an exponential decay result of kesten  @xcite . in section  [ sec_other ]",
    "we apply our method to give short proofs of well - known results for site percolation in the square and triangular lattices .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec_non ] we consider two percolation models that do not correspond to ( independent ) site percolation on any lattice , proving results we believe to be new .",
    "a _ bond percolation measure _ on an infinite graph @xmath5 is a probability measure on the space of assignments of a _ state _ , namely _",
    "open _ or _ closed _ , to each edge @xmath6 of @xmath5 ( with the usual @xmath7-field of measurable events ) .",
    "similarly , a _ site percolation measure _ on @xmath5 is a probability measure on assignments of states to vertices . here , @xmath5 will usually be a planar lattice ; in particular , we consider the square lattice @xmath2 and the triangular lattice @xmath8 .    given a lattice @xmath9 , when discussing bond percolation on @xmath9 we consider the measure @xmath10 in which the states of the edges are independent , and each edge is open with probability @xmath11 .",
    "similarly , when discussing site percolation on @xmath9 we consider the measure @xmath12 in which the vertices are open independently with probability @xmath11 . when there is no danger of confusion , we write @xmath13 for either of these measures .",
    "an _ open cluster _ is a maximal connected subgraph of @xmath9 all of whose edges ( vertices ) are open .",
    "we write @xmath14 for the open cluster containing a given vertex @xmath15 .",
    "thus a vertex @xmath16 lies in @xmath14 if and only if @xmath16 can be reached from @xmath17 by an open path , i.e. , a path in @xmath9 all of whose edges ( vertices ) are open . in the case of site percolation ,",
    "if @xmath17 is closed then @xmath18 .    writing @xmath19 for the number of vertices of @xmath14 , let @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the origin .",
    "we shall always take @xmath22 to be a vertex of @xmath9 . by kolmogorov s @xmath22-@xmath4 law",
    ", percolation occurs if and only if @xmath23 .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath23 , then with probability @xmath4 there is an infinite open cluster somewhere in @xmath9 , while if @xmath24 , then with probability @xmath4 there is no such cluster .",
    "as @xmath25 is increasing in @xmath11 , there is a critical probability @xmath3 such that @xmath24 for @xmath26 and @xmath23 for @xmath27 .",
    "this critical probability depends on the lattice @xmath9 and type of percolation under consideration .",
    "to emphasize this dependence we may write @xmath28 or @xmath29 . here , following welsh ( see  @xcite ) , the @xmath30 is in honour of hammersley ; broadbent and hammersley introduced the basic concepts of percolation in a 1957 paper  @xcite , where they posed the problem of determining @xmath3 in a variety of contexts .",
    "hammersley  @xcite proved general upper and lower bounds which imply , for example , that @xmath31 .",
    "writing @xmath32 for the expectation corresponding to @xmath13 , let @xmath33 be the expected size of the open cluster of the origin .",
    "it is immediate that @xmath34 is increasing in @xmath11 , so there is another critical probability , @xmath35 with the @xmath36 in honour of temperley . as @xmath23 implies @xmath37 , we have @xmath38 .    for many years",
    "it was believed that @xmath39 for bond percolation in @xmath2 ; this conjecture seems not be have been made explicitly , but , supported by various results and numerical evidence , this belief gradually arose . in 1978 , russo  @xcite and seymour and welsh  @xcite made significant progress .",
    "in particular , they proved independently that @xmath40 .",
    "it was only in 1980 , twenty years after harris proof of the inequality @xmath41 , that kesten  @xcite proved that @xmath39 .",
    "since then , menshikov  @xcite ( see also menshikov , molchanov and sidorenko  @xcite ) and aizenman and barsky  @xcite ( see also grimmett  @xcite ) have shown that @xmath42 in great generality , in particular , for site percolation in any lattice graph ; see section [ ss_sth ] for a formal definition .",
    "note that bond percolation in a lattice graph @xmath9 corresponds to site percolation in the line graph of @xmath9 , which can be realized as a lattice graph , so results for site percolation in general lattices apply to bond percolation as well .",
    "below the critical probability , much stronger results are known than @xmath43 . in particular , kesten  @xcite showed in 1981 that for site percolation in a lattice , when @xmath44 , the number @xmath45 of vertices in @xmath46 decays exponentially .",
    "( see also aizenman and newman  @xcite and grimmett  @xcite . ) in the light of the proofs that @xmath42 mentioned above , kesten s result implies that there is a single critical probability @xmath3 , with percolation above @xmath3 and exponential decay of the size of the open cluster of the origin below @xmath3 .",
    "here we shall show that , in various contexts , the method of  @xcite easily gives exponential decay for @xmath26 , implying that @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath47    an important property of bond percolation in @xmath2 is the ` self - duality ' of @xmath2 .",
    "this property is key to the results of harris and kesten . in the context of bond percolation ,",
    "the appropriate notion of duality is the standard one for plane graphs : the dual @xmath48 of a graph @xmath5 drawn in the plane has a vertex for each face of @xmath5 , and an edge @xmath49 for each edge @xmath6 of @xmath5 .",
    "the edge @xmath49 joins the two vertices of @xmath48 corresponding to the faces of @xmath5 in whose boundary @xmath6 lies .",
    "taking @xmath50 , there is a vertex @xmath17 of @xmath48 for each square @xmath51\\times[b , b+1]$ ] , @xmath52 , which we may take to be the point @xmath53 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath48 is isomorphic to @xmath5 ; see figure  [ fig_selfdual ] .",
    "this self - duality can be considered the ` reason why ' @xmath54 , but this trivial observation , made soon after the question first arose , is very far from giving a proof of the harris - kesten result .",
    "as in  @xcite , the proofs here will be mostly self - contained .",
    "the main result we shall use is a sharp - threshold result of friedgut and kalai  @xcite , a simple consequence of a result of kahn , kalai and linial  @xcite concerning the influences of coordinates in a product space .",
    "( see also  @xcite . )",
    "let @xmath55 be a fixed ground set with @xmath56 elements , and let @xmath57 be a random subset of @xmath55 obtained by selecting each @xmath58 independently with probability @xmath11 . for a family @xmath59 of subsets of @xmath55 ,",
    "let @xmath60 be the probability that @xmath61 . in this context , @xmath62 is _ increasing _ if @xmath63 and @xmath64 imply @xmath65 .",
    "also , @xmath62 is _ symmetric _ if there is a permutation group acting transitively on @xmath55 which fixes @xmath62 . in other words , @xmath62 is a union of orbits of the induced action on @xmath66 . in our notation",
    "the result of friedgut and kalai  @xcite we shall need is as follows .",
    "[ th_sharp ] there is an absolute constant @xmath67 such that if @xmath68 , the family @xmath59 is symmetric and increasing , and @xmath69 , then @xmath70 whenever @xmath71 .",
    "we shall also make frequent use of harris lemma .",
    "[ l_harris ] if @xmath62 , @xmath72 are increasing , then for any @xmath11 we have @xmath73    taking complements , the lemma also applies to two _ decreasing _ events , where a decreasing event is the complement of an increasing one . in other contexts ,",
    "lemma  [ l_harris ] is often known as kleitman s lemma  @xcite .",
    "the present context is exactly that of harris original paper  @xcite : @xmath55 will be a set of edges or vertices in the lattice ( according to whether we are considering site or bond percolation ) , and @xmath57 will be the subset of @xmath55 consisting of the open edges / vertices .",
    "thus an event is increasing if it is preserved by changing the states of one or more edges / vertices from closed to open , and harris lemma states that increasing events are positively correlated .",
    "in addition to the results above , we shall need two observations concerning @xmath74-dependent percolation . a bond percolation measure on a graph",
    "@xmath5 is _ @xmath74-dependent _ if , for every pair @xmath75 , @xmath36 of sets of edges of @xmath5 at graph distance at least @xmath74 , the states ( being open or closed ) of the edges in @xmath75 are independent of the states of the edges in @xmath36 . when @xmath76 , the separation condition is exactly that no edge of @xmath75 shares a vertex with an edge of @xmath36 .",
    "the definition of @xmath74-dependence for a site percolation measure on @xmath5 is exactly the same , except that @xmath75 and @xmath36 run over all sets of _ vertices _ at graph distance at least @xmath74 .",
    "here we shall consider dependent measures only on the lattice @xmath2 .",
    "these @xmath74-dependent measures arise very naturally in a variety of contexts ( for example , static renormalization arguments ) , and have been considered by several authors ; see liggett , schonmann and stacey  @xcite and the references therein . in  @xcite ,",
    "a very general comparison result between @xmath74-dependent and product measures is proved : working on any fixed countable graph @xmath5 of bounded degree ( for example , @xmath77 ) , for any @xmath78 there is an @xmath79 such that any @xmath74-dependent measure in which each edge ( vertex ) is open with probability at least @xmath80 dominates the product measure @xmath13 in which edges ( vertices ) are open independently with probability @xmath11 .    in particular ,",
    "provided the individual edge probabilities are high enough , percolation occurs in @xmath2 under the assumption of @xmath4- ( or @xmath74- ) dependence .",

    "the value of @xmath82 is frequently important .",
    "currently , the best known bound is the result of balister , bollobs and walters  @xcite that one can take @xmath84 . here",
    ", the value of @xmath82 will be irrelevant : all we shall need is the essentially trivial lemma  [ l_1dep ] . for completeness , we give a very simple proof that one can take @xmath85 .    indeed , suppose that the open cluster @xmath46 containing the origin is finite .",
    "let @xmath86 be the ( unique ) infinite component of @xmath87 , and let @xmath88 be the edge - boundary of @xmath86 , i.e. , the set of edges joining @xmath86 to @xmath89 .",
    "note that every edge in @xmath88 joins @xmath86 to @xmath46 , and is thus closed .",
    "passing to the lattice @xmath90 dual to @xmath91 as defined above ,",
    "the edges of @xmath90 corresponding to the edges of @xmath9 in @xmath88 form a simple cycle @xmath75 in @xmath90 that surrounds the origin .    @xmath92    given the length @xmath93 of @xmath75 , there are crudely at most @xmath94 possibilities for @xmath75 ( and hence @xmath88 ) : @xmath75 must cross the @xmath95 axis at some @xmath95-coordinate between @xmath96 and @xmath97 . walking round @xmath75 , at each stage",
    "there are at most three possibilities for the next edge , and at most one choice that closes the cycle at the end .",

    "now the states of the edges in @xmath98 are independent of each other , and each @xmath100 is closed with probability at most @xmath101 . putting everything together , we see that the probability that @xmath45 is finite , which is exactly the probability that some closed cycle in the dual surrounds the origin , is at most @xmath102 this is strictly less than @xmath4 if @xmath85 .    finally , a corresponding negative result is just as easy : we repeat the statement and proof from  @xcite .",
    "this time , it is easier to work with site percolation . recall that in the site percolation context , @xmath46",

    "the proof there is rather long ; the majority of the difficulties arise in attempting to compare voronoi percolation with a suitable discrete model , to which the method of @xcite can be applied . here",
    "we shall give a much simpler proof of a discrete result .",
    "we start with @xmath91 . given @xmath523 , we select vertices of @xmath9 independently at random , selecting each with probability @xmath524 , to form a random set @xmath525 . given @xmath525",
    ", we form the voronoi cells associated to these points : for @xmath526 let @xmath527 where @xmath528 is the euclidean distance .",
    "thus @xmath529 is the set of points in the plane at least as close to @xmath263 as to any other point @xmath262 of @xmath525 .",
    "we include the boundary , obtaining with probability @xmath4 a set of closed convex polygons @xmath529 , @xmath526 , that tile @xmath210 .",
    "we say that two cells @xmath530 , @xmath531 are _ weakly adjacent _ if they share at least one point , and _ strongly adjacent _ if they share an edge .",
    "these definitions may differ ; indeed , they will do so wherever four or more cells meet at a vertex . given @xmath525 and @xmath532 , we assign each voronoi cell a _ state _ , _ open _ or _ closed _ , taking cells to be open with probability @xmath11 , independently of each other .",
    "we write @xmath533 for the associated probability measure .",
    "a strong ( weak ) path of open cells is a sequence of open cells in which each consecutive pair is strongly ( weakly ) adjacent .",
    "the strong ( weak ) open component of the origin is the set of cells joined by a strong ( weak ) open path to a cell containing the origin .",
    "[ th_dv ] let @xmath523 and @xmath532 be given .",
    "if @xmath134 , then with positive @xmath533-probability the weak component of the origin is infinite . if @xmath124 , then there is a constant @xmath534 such that the @xmath533-probability that the strong component of the origin contains more than @xmath111 cells is at most @xmath535 .    as @xmath536 , after suitable rescaling @xmath525 converges to a poisson process on @xmath210 , and the voronoi tiling associated to @xmath525 approaches that associated to a poisson process .",
    "in such a tiling , cells meet only three at a vertex , so strong and weak connections coincide .",
    "thus , for small @xmath524 , the set - up considered in theorem  [ th_dv ] is a good approximation to random voronoi percolation , and the result strongly suggests that the critical probability for random voronoi percolation in the plane is @xmath0 , as shown in  @xcite .",
    "however , one can not just deduce this result ( this would amount to an unjustified exchange of the order of two limits ) ; in fact , dealing with random voronoi percolation is much harder .",
    "let us associate a random variable @xmath537 to each vertex @xmath263 of @xmath91 . we take @xmath538 if @xmath539 , @xmath540 if @xmath526 and @xmath529 is open , and @xmath541 if @xmath526 and @xmath529 is closed .",

    "( as usual , consider the topological boundary of the set of open points in @xmath131 reachable by an open path from a point on the left - hand side of @xmath131 . )",

    "the rest of the argument is again similar to that in @xcite and in section  [ bdecay ] .",
    "it suffices to show that for any fixed @xmath524 , @xmath134 , @xmath521 and @xmath199 , there is an @xmath200 such that @xmath564 then , recalling that open paths in @xmath210 correspond to weak paths of open cells , the first statement of theorem  [ th_dv ] follows from lemma  [ l_1dep ] as usual ( see the proof of theorem [ th_sitesq ] in subsection  [ ssite ] , or  @xcite ) , except that we must be a little careful defining the @xmath4-dependent measure : to achieve @xmath4-dependence , we work with a modified form @xmath565 of the event @xmath366 , where @xmath565 depends only on the variables @xmath537 for @xmath263 within distance @xmath566 , say , of the @xmath359 by @xmath360 rectangle @xmath131 . for @xmath199 large enough , we can find such a @xmath565 with probability close to that of @xmath366 ; the argument is as for asymptotic independence .",
