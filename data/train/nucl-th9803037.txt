    "in the last decade , superdeformed ( sd ) bands have been studied extensively both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "since the first observation of sd bands was made in @xmath5dy nucleus in 1986@xcite , they have been found in four mass regions , i.e. , @xmath6@xcite , @xmath7 and @xmath8@xcite .",
    "the theoretical studies of sd have helped to clarify understanding of nuclear deformation .",
    "indeed the present authors carried out an extensive investigation of normal deformations using skyrme - hartree - fock method and reproduced the deformation for almost all even - even nuclei@xcite .",
    "therefore we thought it would be worthwhile to use the method to calculate sd .",
    "these sd bands have been found only at high spins so far , mainly because of the experimental method of formation of sd bands .",
    "it is expected that they may be present at zero spin , like fission isomers in actinide nuclei .",
    "it may require elaborate calculations to search for sd states in the two - dimensional space of angular momentum and quadrupole moment .",
    "therefore , as a first step , we tried to study sd in non - rotating states and did not crank the mean field . in this paper , we looked for sd in non - rotating states using numerical calculations of potential energy surfaces ( pes ) employing the hartree - fock(hf ) with the skyrme interaction together with the bcs method using the seniority force .",
    "a characteristic feature of our calculations is that the single - particle wave functions are expressed in a three - dimensional cartesian - mesh representation as described in ref .",
    "this representation enables one to obtain wave functions for various shapes in a single framework , without any prejudice about shape , i.e. , one need not optimize the deformation of the basis ( like the three oscillator frequencies @xmath9 of the anisotropic harmonic - oscillator basis ) for each solution . solving the mean - field equations in this representation requires , however , a large amount of computation which can be accomplished only with supercomputers .    in this paper",
    "we utilize an hf+bcs code _",
    "ev8_@xcite , in which the mean - field potential is assumed to be symmetric for reflections in the @xmath10- , @xmath11- , and @xmath12-planes ( the point group d@xmath13 ) .",
    "we set the mesh size to 1 fm , while the size of the box is @xmath14 fm .",
    "we put an octant of a nucleus at a corner of the box .",
    "for the bcs part , we employ the seniority force .    in sect .",
    "[ sect : hg ] , we compare various parameter sets of the skyrme force to see how accurately they can reproduce the excitation energy of the sd band head of @xmath1hg . we explain our method to determine the pairing force strengths .",
    "we also show how strongly the pairing correlation affects the properties of sd states . in sect .",
    "[ sect : fi ] , we study the fission isomers in @xmath15u . in sect .  [ sect : syshf ] , we systematically search large - deformation solutions employing the skm@xmath3 force .",
    "we compare the results with those obtained by krieger et al .",

    "@xcite determined the excitation energies and the spins of a sd band in @xmath1hg down to @xmath16 . by extrapolating the spectrum to @xmath17",
    ", they could predict reliably the excitation energy of the band head to be 6.017 mev .    in table",
    "[ tab : hg194 ] , theoretical predictions ( listed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) are shown to be compared with the extrapolated value .",
    "one can see that all of the predictions are either lower or higher than the extrapolated value by at least 0.9 mev .",
    "[ fig : hg194 ] presents the results of our hf+bcs calculations using nine sets of the skyrme force parameters .",
    "we draw pes curves as functions of the quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath18 defined as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the axially symmetric mass quadrupole moment , @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the squared mass radius , @xmath25 @xmath21 @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 .",
    "the excitation energy @xmath29 of the sd minimum at @xmath30 measured from the ground - state minimum at @xmath31 is given in parentheses in units of mev for each force .    the left - hand portion of fig .",
    "[ fig : hg194 ] shows the results with five widely - used skyrme interactions ; siii@xcite , sksc4@xcite , skm@xmath3@xcite , skp@xcite , and sgii@xcite .",
    "one can see that the skm@xmath3 as well as the skp forces are the best ones to reproduce the experimental value of @xmath29 . on the other hand ,",
    "the siii and the sksc4 forces make the nucleus too stiff against deformation , while the sgii too soft . from a macroscopic point of view",
    ", the softness toward deformation is determined by the smallness of the surface energy coefficient @xmath32@xcite specific to each force .",
    "the skm@xmath3 is a force adjusted so as to reproduce the fission barrier height of @xmath33pu and thus is expected to have the correct surface energy coefficient .    the right - hand portion of fig .",
    "[ fig : hg194 ] gives the results for four new parameter sets , ski2 - ski5@xcite .",
    "these forces have different features involving the density dependence of the spin - orbit potential .",
    "the standard skyrme interactions , such as ski2 and ski5 , produce spin - orbit potentials for neutrons which are proportional to the gradient of @xmath34 , where @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) denotes the nucleon ( neutron ) density . on the other hand ,",
    "the spin - orbit potentials produced by ski3 and ski4 are proportional to the gradient of @xmath35 and roughly @xmath37(=@xmath38 ) , respectively .",
    "the parameters of ski2 - ski4 were determined by fitting to the same set of nuclear properties .",
    "a slightly different set of the quantities was adjusted to determine ski5 . among these four forces",
    ", ski3 reproduces the experimental value of @xmath29 very accurately . on the other hand , ski2 and ski5 ( i.e. , standard skyrme forces )",
    "make the nucleus too soft against deformations while ski4 too stiff .",
    "this fact is consistent with the relativistic mean - field theory , whose `` spin - orbit potential '' has a similar density dependence@xcite to that of ski3 .",
    "we now discuss the effects of pairing . using the same skyrme interaction skm@xmath3 , krieger s calculation@xcite and ours give different results , which originate in the difference of the strengths of the seniority interaction used to describe the pairing correlation .",
    "krieger et al .  used the pairing force strengths @xmath39 ( @xmath40=n for neutrons and @xmath40=p for protons ) given by the following formula , @xmath41.\\ ] ] on the other hand , we determined the strengths @xmath39 such that the so - called classical empirical formula of the average pairing gap , @xmath42,\\ ] ] is reproduced for shell - effect - averaged level density obtained in the thomas - fermi approximation .",
    "the pairing - active space is the same in both the krieger et al .",
    "treatment and ours : single - particle levels below `` the fermi level plus 5 mev '' were taken into account in the bcs calculation in both cases .",

    "the krieger et al .",
    "strength ( @xmath43=0.192 mev ) gives a rather large pairing gap ( @xmath44 mev ) , while our pairing strength ( @xmath45 ( mev ) ) produces a reasonable size gap ( @xmath46 mev ) for @xmath47 .",
    "on the other hand , the pairing gap of neutrons does not differ very much between the two calculations and has a reasonable size as shown in the middle portion of fig .",
    "[ fig : hg194_pair ] .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the fact that the krieger et al",
    ".  strength ( @xmath48 mev ) and our strength ( @xmath49 ( mev ) ) do not differ very much .",
    "the pes curves are shown in the bottom portion of fig.[fig : hg194_pair ] .",
    "one can see that the reduction of the proton s pairing force strength raises the energy by 3 mev at the barrier and by 1 mev at the sd minimum while leaving the energy almost unchanged at the oblate minimum .",
    "consequently , krieger et al .",
    "obtained @xmath50 mev , which is lower than our value by 1.3 mev , and the barrier height ( defined in the figure ) @xmath51 mev , which is lower than our value by 1.7 mev .",
    "note that the half - life of the sd band head due to decay into the normal - deformaion ( nd ) well is longer for higher barriers .",
    "we have estimated the half - life using wkb approximation ( @xmath52 in eq.([eq : fb ] ) ) .",
    "the resulting half - life is @xmath53 sec for the krieger et al.pairing force strengths while it is @xmath54 sec for our strengths .",

    "but the level density near the fermi surface is relatively small so that neighboring isotopes have an sd .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the proton pairing gap sharply decreases , while the neutron pairing gap does rather smoothly at @xmath57 , as we showed in fig.[fig : hg194_pair ] .",
    "the analysis of the sd state in @xmath1hg indicates the appropriateness of our pairing force strengths combined with the skm@xmath3 , skp , and ski3 forces for the hf potential .",
