    "the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking is essential to explain the origin of masses of fermions and vector bosons in the standard model , and it is the reason why the higgs particle , that is hoped to be discovered by the lhc in the next years , was postulated . in 1973",
    "@xcite , coleman and weinberg ( cw ) discussed the very appealing scenario that radiative corrections could naturally induce this symmetry breaking .",
    "their discussion was focused on four - dimensional models , but the mechanism of dynamical generation of mass in three - dimensional models was also considered afterwards  @xcite .",
    "three - dimensional fields models are interesting for offering a simpler setting to study properties of gauge theories , including the possibility of the introduction of a topological mass ( chern - simons ) term  @xcite in the lagrangian . from a more practical viewpoint , chern - simons theories in three - dimensions were applied to the understanding of the quantized hall effect  @xcite .",
    "more recently , supersymmetric chern - simons models  @xcite have been on focus due to its duality with gravity  @xcite .",
    "conformal chern - simons theory have been explored in the construction of a theory modeling m2-branes  @xcite , and chern - simons gravities were coupled to 2p - branes  @xcite .",
    "when studying some three - dimensional gauge theories coupled to a scalar field , in such a way that no dimensionful parameters appear in the classical lagrangian , it was found that quantum corrections dynamically introduce a mass for the vector and scalar particles  @xcite .",
    "differently from what happens in four - dimensional models , where the gauge symmetry is dynamically broken already at one - loop order , in three dimensions this mechanism appears only when two - loop corrections to the effective potential are taken into account .",
    "it was long ago shown that the three - dimensional massless supersymmetric quantum electrodynamics and wess - zumino models do not exhibit dynamical generation of mass up to one - loop level  @xcite . recently , in  @xcite , one of us examined the two - loop quantum corrections to the @xmath2 wess - zumino model and found the existence of dynamical generation of mass , via coleman - weinberg mechanism , and in  @xcite it was shown that the massive three - dimensional supersymmetric quantum electrodynamics exhibit a spontaneous gauge symmetry broken phase .",
    "this motivates the investigation of whether dynamical generation of mass also happens in higher loop levels in the three - dimensional supersymmetric chern - simons - matter model ( scsm ) .    in this work",
    ", we will study the possibility of dynamical breaking of the gauge symmetry and of supersymmetry in a three - dimensional supersymmetric chern - simons model coupled to a complex scalar matter superfield with a quartic self - interaction .",
    "this is the simplest supersymmetric three - dimensional analog to the conformally invariant model studied by coleman - weinberg  @xcite , where no mass scale appears in the classical lagrangian .",
    "our results are that the superconformal and gauge symmetries admits a broken phase but supersymmetry does not .",
    "we also show that the cw mechanism of breakdown of the gauge and superconformal symmetries does not work for the @xmath3 extension of the scsm , in agreement with the results obtained by gaiotto and yin  @xcite and by buchbinder et al .",
