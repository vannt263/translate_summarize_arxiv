    "it is well known ( see , e.g. @xcite ) that high energy electron beam incident on an oriented single crystal produces the coherent radiation that is due to the spatial periodicity of the lattice atoms , and the incoherent one , that is due to the thermal spread of atoms from their positions of equilibrium in the lattice .",
    "for the first look , the incoherent part of radiation is similar to the last in amorphous medium ( with bethe - heitler spectrum ) , and do not depend on the crystal orientation in relation to the particles beam",
    ".    however , in @xcite it was paid attention to the fact that some features of the particle s dynamics in the crystal ( channeling effect etc . )",
    "could lead to various substantial orientation effects in the hard range of the spectrum , where ( for @xmath0 gev electrons ) the incoherent part is predominant .",
    "the semi - numerical approach developed in @xcite was used for interpretation of early experimental data @xcite .",
    "the ideas of @xcite had been referred by the authors of recent experiments @xcite to interpret some of their results . in our article",
    "we present the results of simulation of the incoherent radiation under the conditions of the experiment @xcite .",
    "a good agreement with the experimental data confirms the interpretation given in @xcite .    in the present report we present the results of simulation of the incoherent bremsstrahlung under the conditions of the recent experiment @xcite , were",
    "the radiation from the electrons moving in periodically bent crystal had been registered .",
    "radiation of relativistic electron in matter develops in a large spatial region along the particle s momentum .",
    "this region is known as the coherence length ( or formation length ) @xcite @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the energy of the initial electron , @xmath3 is the radiated photon frequency , @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the electron mass , @xmath6 is the speed of light . in the large range of radiation frequencies",
    "the coherence length could exceed the interatomic distances in crystal : @xmath7 in this case the effective constant of interaction of the electron with the lattice atoms may be large in comparison with the unit , so we could use the semiclassical description of the radiation process .",
    "if , in addition to that , the electron s scattering angle on the coherence length @xmath8 satisfies the condition @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the electron s lorentz factor , the dipole approximation is valid @xcite . in this approximation the spectral density of bremsstrahlung under subsequent collisions on atoms could be described by the formula @xmath11 \\left| \\sum_n",
    "\\boldsymbol\\vartheta_n e^{icqt_n } \\right|^2 , \\label{sst : eq2}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the two - dimensional electron scattering angle under collision with the @xmath14-th atom , @xmath15 is the time moment of the collision .",
    "consider now the radiation of the electron incident onto the crystal under small angle @xmath16 to one of its crystallographic axes .",
    "it is known @xcite that averaging of the value @xmath17 over the thermal vibrations of atoms in the lattice leads to the split of this value ( and so the radiation intensity ) into the sum of two terms describing coherent and incoherent effects in radiation : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the impact parameter of the collision with the @xmath14-th atom in its equilibrium position @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the trajectory of the electron in the plane orthogonal to the crystallographic axis ( which could be obtained by numerical integration of the equation of motion ) , and @xmath22 is the thermal shift of the @xmath14-th atom from the position of equilibrium . in the range of radiation frequencies for which @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the distance between two parallel atomic strings the closest to each other , the incoherent term ( [ sst : eq5 ] ) makes the main contribution into the bremsstrahlung intensity ( [ sst : eq2 ] ) .",
    "the radiation by the uniform beam of particles is characterized by the radiation efficiency , that is the radiation intensity ( [ sst : eq2 ] ) integrated over impact parameters of the particles incidence onto the crystal in the limits of one elementary cell .",
    "so , the efficiency is the classical analog of the quantum cross section . in the further consideration",
    "we shall compare the radiation efficiency in the crystal to the bethe - heitler efficiency of bremsstrahlung in amorphous medium .    for further computational details",
    "see @xcite .",
    "when charged particles are incident onto the crystal under small angle @xmath25 to one of the atomic planes densely packed with atoms , the channeling phenomenon could takes the place ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . under planar channeling the electron moves in the potential well formed by the attractive continuum potential of the atomic plane ( see figure 1 , left panel ) .",
    "the largest incidence angle , for which the capture into the channel is possible , is called as the critical channeling angle @xmath26 @xcite .         to @xmath27 plane of si crystal , as a result of simulation . ]    under @xmath28 the most part of the incident electrons would move in the planar channeling regime . these electrons will collide with atoms at small impact parameters more frequently then in amorphous medium , that leads to the increase of the incoherent bremsstrahlung efficiency ( see figure 2 ) . for @xmath29 the above - barrier motion in the continuum potential takes the place for the most part of the particles ( figure 1 , right panel ) .",
    "above - barrier electrons rapidly cross the atomic plane , with reduced number of close collisions with atoms comparing to the case of amorphous medium .",
    "this leads to the decrease of the incoherent bremsstrahlung efficiency ( figure 2 ) . for the positron beam",
    "the situation is opposite .",
    "incoherent multiple scattering on the thermal vibrations on the lattice atoms leads to dechanneling of the particles and , as a consequence , to smoothing of the orientation dependence described above @xcite .",
    "the simulation was carried out under the conditions of the recent experiment performed at the mainz microtron mami @xcite to explore the radiation emission from silicon crystal with 4-period bent ( 110)-planes ( period of oscillations",
    "@xmath30 @xmath31 , amplitude @xmath32  , electron energy @xmath33 mev ) .",
    "the radiation yield with the photon energy @xmath34 , for which the incoherent radiation mechanism is predominant , had been registered .    for the simulation we let the crystal is aligned on the goniometer in such a way that the zero angle of incidence to ( 110)-plane is achieved for the goniometer angle @xmath35 mrad , and the zero angle of incidence to ( 001)-plane is achieved for @xmath36 mrad , like in the experiment @xcite",
    ".    the results of simulation ( figure 3 and 4 ) demonstrate ( at least qualitative ) agreement with the experimental data ."
