    "over the past years the properties of charmed hadrons have received a lot of attention in connection with experiments in lepton colliders ( cleo , belle , babar ) and hadron facilities ( cdf at fermilab , phenix , star at rhic , and the forthcoming panda and cbm experiments at fair ) @xcite .",
    "the discovery of new resonances with charm content has sparked the interest of not only many experimental but also theoretical research groups in order to find plausible explanations for the nature of the newly found states .",
    "the study and characterization of resonances has been a very active topic of research in hadrons physics during the last decades .",
    "the goal is to establish whether some resonances have the genuine @xmath10 or @xmath11 structure predicted by the quark model @xcite or , alternatively , qualify better as hadron molecules generated dynamically .",
    "a series of pioneer works @xcite , based on a @xmath4-channel vector - meson exchange ( tvme ) force , and more recent approaches in terms of chiral lagrangians @xcite have proven to be very promising and successful in describing a wealth of @xmath12-wave baryonic resonances in the light su(3 ) sector within the molecular picture using coupled - channel dynamics with effective hadronic degrees of freedom . in the modern language of chiral lagrangians",
    "those states emerge from the scattering of the @xmath13 octet goldstone bosons off baryons of the nucleon @xmath14 octet .",
    "moreover , @xmath15 and @xmath16 wave baryonic resonances have been generated based on the su(3 ) leading - order chiral lagrangian by means of meson scattering off baryons of the @xmath17 decuplet @xcite and incorporating vector - meson degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "molecular states of two pseudoscalar mesons and one baryon @xcite have also been studied to interpret low - lying @xmath14 states .",
    "all these results sustain the so - called hadrogenesis conjecture , formulated by lutz and kolomeitsev a few years ago , according to which resonances not belonging to the large @xmath18 ground state of qcd are generated by coupled - channel dynamics @xcite .",
    "recently , the charm degree of freedom has been incorporated in those unitarized coupled - channel approaches to describe open- and hidden - charm mesons @xcite .",
    "similar methods have been used in the meson - baryon sector @xcite , partially motivated by the parallelism between the @xmath19 and the @xmath20 .",
    "the meson - baryon interaction in the charm sector is constructed using the @xmath4-channel exchange of vector mesons between pseudoscalar mesons and baryons and performing the zero - range approximation while preserving chiral symmetry for light mesons @xcite .",
    "the extension to @xmath0-wave @xmath21 resonances was first attempted by extending the basis to include the @xmath22 baryons @xcite . in order to be consistent with the spin - flavor heavy - quark symmetry ( hqs ) @xcite ,",
    "the vector mesons were incorporated later within a su(8)-inspired model @xcite , similar to the su(6 ) one developed in the light sector @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach based on the local hidden gauge formalism has recently become available @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "there have been also attempts to construct the @xmath6 and @xmath23 interaction by incorporating the charm degree of freedom in the su(3 ) meson - exchange model of the jlich group @xcite .",
    "nuclear medium modifications have been lately incorporated as a second step .",
    "the aim is to further investigate on the nature of resonant states , such as @xmath20 , but also to test the dynamics of charmed hadrons with nucleons and nuclei .",
    "the properties of open - charm mesons in nuclear matter can influence the charmonium production in hot dense matter , which might indicate the formation of the quark - gluon plasma phase of qcd at high density and temperature @xcite .",
    "another exciting scenario is the possible formation of @xmath0-mesic nuclei @xcite and of exotic nuclear bound states like @xmath24 in nuclei @xcite . from the experimental side ,",
    "the physics program of the cbm experiment as well as part of the panda collaboration at fair @xcite will be devoted to the properties of open and hidden charm in dense matter .",
    "in particular , the physics goal is to extend to the heavy - quark sector the gsi program for in - medium modifications of hadron properties in the light sector , and to provide insight into the charm - nucleus interaction .",
    "works based on mean - field approaches provided important shifts for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 open - charm meson masses @xcite , which alters the formation of charmonium @xcite .",
    "some of those models have been recently revised @xcite .",
    "a different perspective is offered by models that , working within coupled - channel unitarized schemes , go beyond mean field and provide the spectral features of the charm mesons in symmetric nuclear matter at zero @xcite and finite temperature @xcite . lately",
    ", this meson - baryon basis has been extended to incorporate hqs . in this way ,",
    "not only @xmath0-meson but also @xmath25-meson features have been studied @xcite .",
    "a common feature of the previous models is the use of an interaction kernel in the zero - range approximation ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "this is justified for diagonal amplitudes close to threshold and for non - diagonal transition amplitudes where the masses of mesons and of baryons in the initial and final meson - baryon states differ moderately .",
    "however , the charm - exchange processes , for which the difference in masses between the external mesons is comparable with the mass of the charmed vector meson being exchanged , point towards the breakdown of the zero - range approximation .",
    "charmed baryon resonances have been studied using the full @xmath4-dependence of the @xmath4-channel vector - exchange driving term in ref .",
    "@xcite . compared to the previous tvme local models , where the @xmath27 limit was implemented , the work of ref .",
    "@xcite obtained the same amount of resonances but located in general at somewhat higher energies and having larger widths .",
    "some of these resonances could clearly be identifiable with experimentally seen states , such as @xmath20 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .    in the present work",
    ", we study the behavior of the dynamically - generated baryonic resonaces in hot dense matter , as well as the spectral features of the open charm mesons ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) , within a self - consistent coupled - channel approach that considers the full @xmath4-dependent tvme interaction kernel employed in ref .",
    "we pay a particular attention to the influence that the dressed mesons exert on each other .",
    "we find that the simultaneous dressing of the charm mesons ( @xmath31 ) in the @xmath32 sector , or the anticharm mesons ( @xmath33 ) in the @xmath34 one , affects their in - medium properties in a non - negligible way .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec . [",
    "sec : formalism ] , we present the formalism .",
    "we first revise the model adopted for the free space amplitudes and , next , we describe the modifications that incorporate the medium effects .",
    "our results for the medium modified resonances and for the spectral functions of the open - charm mesons at various densities and temperatures are shown in sec .",
    "a summary of our conclusions is presented in sec .",
    "in this section , we will first review briefly the coupled - channel approach employed in our previous work @xcite , where we studied open - charm baryon resonances dynamically generated from the free - space interaction of the low - lying pseudoscalar mesons with the ground - state baryons using a @xmath4-channel vector - exchange driving force .",
    "after that , we will introduce the main sources of medium effects and we will implement them in our coupled - channel formalism",
    ".    since the properties of the @xmath0 , @xmath7 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons in a hot and dense environment will be determined , respectively , from the @xmath6 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 amplitudes , we list in table  [ tab : channels ] the corresponding set of coupled channels in each of the related isospin ( @xmath38 ) , strangeness ( @xmath12 ) and charm ( @xmath39 ) sectors .",
    ".coupled - channel meson - baryon states involved in @xmath6 , @xmath35 , @xmath40 , or @xmath41 interactions .",
    "the energy threshold of each state is given in brackets . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the are two main sources of medium effects to consider : one is a consequence of the pauli exclusion principle , that prevents the scattering of two nucleons into states which are already occupied . the other is related to the fact that the properties of all mesons and baryons are modified in the medium due to their interactions with the fermi sea of nucleons .",
    "pauli blocking and finite temperature effects can be incorporated in the coupled - channel equations by simply replacing the free nucleon propagator by the in - medium one , @xmath42~ , \\label{eq : g}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the total four - momentum of the nucleon in the nuclear matter rest frame , @xmath44 is the usual fermi ",
    "dirac distribution function , and @xmath45 is the on - shell energy of the nucleon .    the nuclear medium effects on the mesons can be incorporated by including their corresponding self - energies , @xmath46 , in the meson propagator @xmath47 being @xmath48 the four - momentum of the meson .",
    "this is done in practice through the corresponding lehmann representation of the meson propagator @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the spectral function of the meson @xmath51 : @xmath52 we note here that in this work only the @xmath53 and @xmath3 mesons have been dressed by self - energy insertions .",
    "mesons @xmath54 and @xmath55 have not been dressed , as done e.g. , in refs .",
    "the reason is that the states containing these mesons couple weakly to the @xmath56 and @xmath36 ones and , therefore , it is expected that approximating the @xmath54 spectral functions by the free - space ones , _ i.e. , _ delta functions , will not influence much the in - medium properties of the @xmath0 and @xmath2 mesons .",
    "we emphasize , however , that the present work addresses for the first time the simultaneous dressing of the @xmath0 and @xmath2 mesons in the charm @xmath32 sector , and that of the @xmath7 and @xmath9 mesons in the charm @xmath34 one .    the loop function for the free case given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : j ] ) must now be replaced by the one including the medium and temperature effects on the baryon and meson propagators , as given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : g ] ) and ( [ eq : leh ] ) . using the imaginary time ( or matsubara ) formalism @xcite",
    "we obtain : @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 , with @xmath60 and @xmath61 , are the total energy , total momentum , and relative momentum of the meson - baryon pair in the nuclear matter rest frame , @xmath62 is the fermi distribution of the baryon and @xmath63 is the bose enhancement factor of the meson . in practice ,",
    "given the nuclear densities and temperatures explored in the present work , we can set @xmath64 for all mesons and @xmath65 for all baryons except for nucleons .",
    "one might argue that the bose enhancement factor for the pions should not be ignored .",
    "however , as tested in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath6 amplitudes are insensitive to this factor due to the reduced coupling to @xmath66 states resulting from the heavy mass of the meson exchanged in the transition potential .",
    "the in - medium scattering amplitudes @xmath67 are obtained by directly solving the coupled - channel eq .",
    "( [ eq : lspw ] ) with the medium modified loop function @xmath68 .",

    "finally , we note that the self - energies @xmath71 @xmath72 must be determined in a self - consistent way since they are obtained from the in - medium scattering amplitudes @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , which contain the loop functions @xmath77 , @xmath78 ( @xmath6 case ) ; @xmath79 ( @xmath80 case ) ; @xmath81 ( @xmath82 case ) ; and @xmath83 , @xmath84 ( @xmath85 case ) , that are themselves functions of the self - energies @xmath71 .",

    "first of all , we note that their in - medium properties will be influenced by the charm @xmath32 baryonic resonances that couple significatively to @xmath6 and @xmath36 . from the results of our previous work @xcite , summarized in table  [ tab : reson ] , we find the well known @xmath20 , coupling very strongly to @xmath6 states in the @xmath91 sector , and two other resonances , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , coupling also significatively to @xmath6 in the sector @xmath94",

    "the amplitude in free space ( @xmath99 ) is also shown ( dash - dotted lines ) , as a reference . when only pauli blocking effects are included ( dashed line )",
    "we observe that the @xmath20 and @xmath93 states appear displaced to higher energies , by about 60 and 50 mev , respectively .",
    "this repulsive effect is well known , and has to do with the loss of phase space associated to the fact that the nucleons are forced to occupy empty states that are located at momentum states above the fermi momentum . however , when the dressing of the @xmath0 meson is incorporated self - consistently ( dotted line ) @xmath20 resonance moves to substantially lower energies and the @xmath93 dilutes .",
    "this is naturally explained in terms of the @xmath0-meson strength distribution which , as we will see , shows a quasiparticle peak at a lower energy than in free space and a pronounced peak at even lower energies related to @xmath100 excitations .",
    "the reduced in - medium @xmath6 threshold opens decay channels for the @xmath93 which , therefore , broadens considerably . as for the @xmath20 ,",
    "its position makes it very sensitive to the low energy strength of the @xmath0 spectral function and , together with the larger coupling to @xmath6 states , explains why the resonance acquires such a large amount of attraction .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the tvme in the @xmath26 limit is employed , a similar behavior is observed for the @xmath20 .",
    "the repulsive shift with respect to the free space position due to pauli blocking effects is compensated by the attractive self - consistent dressing of the @xmath0 meson . however , the shift is smaller in ref .",
    "@xcite , as it can be seen from fig .  5 of this reference ( model b ) .",
    "moreover , this tvme ( @xmath26 ) model also generates a @xmath101 resonance , which lies around 2795 mev for model b. this structure melts down as the dressing of @xmath0 mesons is incorporated , because of the opening of new absortion channels , and stays close to the position with only pauli blocking effects , in agreement with our present results . in the tvme model of ref .  @xcite both resonances are generated but the @xmath101 one is localized at a much smaller energy , around 2620 mev . in that work",
    "the self - consistent dressing of @xmath0 mesons results in an attractive shift for both @xmath102 and @xmath101 dynamically generated resonances , in contrast to our results.within the su(8 ) weinberg - tomozawa model of ref .",
    "@xcite , where heavy - quark spin symmetry is implemented , the @xmath101 state lies around 2900 mev and has a different spin , @xmath103 . in this scheme",
    ", the @xmath101 resonance couples strongly to the @xmath104 channel instead of @xmath6 and behaves similarly in matter as the @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "it is clear from table  [ tab : reson ] that the strong coupling of the @xmath20 resonance to the @xmath105 channel and that of the @xmath93 to @xmath106 states , makes it advisable to consider also the medium modifications of the @xmath2 meson in the intermediate @xmath5 loops of the @xmath56 amplitude .",
    "this is a quite arduous task that , up to our knowledge , has been attempted for the first time in the present work .",
    "our results , represented by the solid lines in fig .  [ fig : ampl ] , clearly show the importance of such dressing , making the @xmath20 to appear 35 mev higher in energy with respect to the case of considering free @xmath2 mesons in the @xmath5 loops .",

    "actually , the distribution of the @xmath0-meson strength shown in the lower - left panel is very rich .",
    "all the approximations give a quasi - particle peak located around 35 mev below the free @xmath0-meson mass .",
    "in addition , each resonance leaving a signature in the self - energy produces a resonant - hole excitation peak in the spectral function , located at a somewhat different value of energy due to the complex structure of the self - energy .",
    "the common behavior is that the resonance - hole modes in the spectral function get displaced such that they move further away from the quasiparticle peak . in the case of pauli blocking , we can clearly distinguish three of such modes , associated to @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 excitations . when meson dressing is incorporated , only the @xmath113 excitation mode is clearly visible .",

    "@xcite the quasiparticle peak appears at slightly lower energies than the free mass but the @xmath0-meson spectral function shows a completely different shape due to the different resonant - hole composition of the @xmath0-meson self - energy .    the imaginary part of the @xmath2 self - energy , displayed in the upper right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : selfd ] shows only a small enhancement at around 2 gev . this is a reflection of the enhanced cusp found in the @xmath115 amplitude at the @xmath116 threshold @xcite .",

    "this relocation of strength from the quasi - particle peak to higher energies diminishes the size of the @xmath5 loops involved in the coupled - channel problem .",

    "@xcite , this is due to the fact that the strength under this peak also receives contributions from @xmath141 hole excitations , which are washed out by temperature as any other resonant - hole mode . consequently , the peak of the @xmath0-meson spectral function becomes narrower and more symmetric as temperature increases , similarly to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the density effects observed in the spectral functions are also clearly understood .",
    "in general , we find that the self - energy roughly doubles its size when going from nuclear matter at normal nuclear matter saturation density to a system which is two times denser .",
    "this is consistent with the low density limit behavior and points at a weak density dependence of the in - medium meson - nucleon amplitude in this density region .",
    "this is the reason why , in general , the quasiparticle peak of the spectral functions at @xmath132 are found approximately twice further away from the free space position and are twice wider than in the case of @xmath88 .",
    "we have studied the properties of open charm mesons , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , in nuclear matter at finite temperature within a self - consistent coupled - channel approach which uses , as meson - baryon interaction , a full @xmath4-dependent vector meson exchange driving force .",
    "the in - medium scattering amplitudes are obtained by solving the lippmann - schwinger equation at finite temperature including pauli blocking effects , as well as @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 self - energies , paying a particular attention to their mutual influence .",
    "we have analyzed how our dynamically generated resonances are affected by density and temperature .",
    "as in other similar approaches , the resonances that couple strongly to intermediate states involving nucleons , move upwards in energy when pauli blocking effects are considered , as a consequence of the loss of phase space .",
    "when the self - consistent dressing of the charm mesons is incorporated , the resonances gain attraction again .",
    "we have seen that dressing the @xmath2 meson has a non - negligible effect on the @xmath56 amplitude and on the properties of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "therefore , we conclude that a simultaneous in - medium treatment of both mesons , as the one attempted in the present work , is necessary . similarly , the in - medium properties of the @xmath9 and @xmath7 mesons are interrelated and must be also considered together .",
    "the spectral functions of the @xmath0 and @xmath9 mesons are quite rich . at @xmath133 mev and normal nuclear matter density",
    "one finds a quasiparticle peak located below the corresponding free meson mass by about 50 mev , as well as strength associated to resonant - hole excitations which , in the particular case of the @xmath0 meson , is clearly visible as a narrow @xmath142 excitation peak .    in general",
    ", increasing the temperature has the effect of moving the quasiparticle peak towards its free location making it wider , as a consequence of a milder meson - baryon interaction and a larger amount of collisions .",
    "the exception found for the @xmath0-meson is naturally explained in terms of the mixing of the quasi - particle peak with a resonant - hole mode .",
    "for the densities explored , up to twice nuclear matter normal saturation density , we have found that the density effects follow the linear behavior expected for the low density regime : the self - energy roughly doubles its size when going from nuclear matter at normal saturation density to a system which is two times denser , indicating a mild density dependence of the in - medium meson - baryon interaction amplitudes .",
    "the enormous computational effort of the present work , which uses a coupled - channel formalism , an interaction that goes beyond the @xmath143 limit , and the simultaneous consideration of the in - medium @xmath0 and @xmath2 ( @xmath131 and @xmath126 ) meson self - energies , has prevented us from incorporating the coupling to states involving vector - mesons .",
    "we are aware that , given the availability of models that permit dealing with these important degrees of freedom , our approach should be extended to the vector mesons such that it also includes , for instance , the @xmath144 and @xmath145 channels in the @xmath32 , @xmath146 sector .",
    "we hope that , by first identifying which channels play a relevant role and which ones might be omitted , we can make progress toward this goal in the nearby future .",
