    "the study of flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) decays has been a fruitful avenue of research throughout the history of particle physics .",
    "today rare @xmath0-meson decays based on the process @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 or @xmath9 ) provide one of the most promising probes for new physics .",
    "both @xmath0-factory experiments ,  and belle , have observed decays of this type and reported measurements which probe their underlying structure .",
    "the decays proceed through loop diagrams such as those shown in figure  [ fig - slldiags ] .",
    "-box ( right ) diagrams responsible for @xmath10 decays.,width=302 ]    the theoretical treatment of @xmath7 transitions in the standard model ( sm ) invokes an effective field theory in which the hamiltonian is a sum of terms , where each term consists of ckm factors and a wilson coefficient multiplying an operator that is formed from the light quark and lepton fields .",
    "the wilson coefficients , obtained by integrating out the heavy particles , characterize the short - distance physics in these decays .",
    "new physics ( e.g. , susy ) would modify the wilson coefficients by providing new particles inside the loops and may modify the hamiltonian by adding scalar or pseudoscalar terms . to account for qcd effects that mix the operators , so - called effective wilson coefficients",
    "are defined , which are functions of a renormalization scale  @xmath9 ( typically taken to be 4.6  gev in the @xmath11 scheme ) and the squared dilepton mass @xmath12 .",
    "measurements of @xmath7 decays mainly probe the effective wilson coefficients @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "fully inclusive measurements are not possible , and the background environment is very difficult for analyses that combine multiple exclusive modes , so it is conventional to focus on the exclusive modes @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( denoted together as @xmath18 ) .",
    "form factor uncertainties complicate the interpretation of exclusive measurements , but a number of measurable asymmetries , defined below , are relatively insensitive to these uncertainties .",
    "an up - to - date summary of the theoretical status , along with extensive references , can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the related decays @xmath19 are also of considerable interest , but experimentally present almost insurmountable problems owing to the missing neutrinos . nonetheless , the @xmath0-factory experiments have conducted searches , and  has a recent update .",
    "the decays @xmath3 and @xmath5 proceed through essentially the same diagrams , where the @xmath20 quark is replaced by a @xmath21 quark , leading to ckm suppression by a factor @xmath22 ; in addition , the two - body decays are helicity suppressed .",
    "consequently , these decays have quite small sm branching fractions and have thus far not been observed .",
    "belle has recently reported a new limit on @xmath3 .",
    "the decays @xmath6 proceed through simple @xmath23-exchange and are sensitive to the product @xmath24 .",
    "combined with a measurement of @xmath25 from another source , measurement of any of these branching fractions would provide a good measurement of the @xmath0-meson decay constant @xmath26 .",
    "for the @xmath27 and @xmath28 cases , the branching fractions are quite small due to helicity suppression , although the @xmath29 decay appears to be only just beyond the reach of the current @xmath0-factory experiments .",
    "the status of @xmath30 is presented in another contribution to this conference @xcite .    below",
    ", the status of these rare fcnc @xmath0 decays is described , with emphasis on recent results from belle and .",
    "these decays experience interference from the processes @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "consequently , it is necessary to remove events with lepton - pair mass close to the @xmath34 or @xmath35 peaks . on the positive side",
    ", these processes provide large and well - understood control samples which can be used to study efficiencies and to study the characteristics of signal - like events ( e.g. , to determine pdfs for fits ) .",
    "the main backgrounds to these decays arise from @xmath0 and @xmath36 semileptonic decays .",
    "the two leptons can come from the semileptonic decay of both the @xmath0 and @xmath37 in an event , or from the semileptonic decays of a @xmath0 and also its daughter @xmath36 .",
    "these backgrounds are suppressed by combining event shape information , vertex information , and missing energy information into multivariate analysis techniques ( such as neural nets ) .",
    "another important background , @xmath38 ( followed by @xmath39 ) wherein pions are misidentified as muons , can be explicity vetoed by rejecting events in which one of the muons , when assigned the pion mass , reconstructs in combination with a kaon to the @xmath36 mass .",
    "signal can then be separated from the residual background using maximum likelihood fits , typically utilizing the differing shapes of signal and background distributions in the quantities @xmath40 and @xmath41=m_{\\rm bc}[{\\rm belle } ] = \\sqrt{e^{*2}_{\\rm beam } - p^{*2}_b}$ ] , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the cm energy and momentum of the reconstructed @xmath0 .",
    "has recently reported a series of measurements based on @xmath44 of data ( 384 million @xmath45 pairs ) .",
    "these results are described below and are compared to belle results where possible .",
    "the  analysis of @xmath46 reconstructs 10 submodes , reflecting five possible @xmath47 final states ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 ) , each paired with @xmath53 or @xmath54 .",
    "electrons ( muons ) are required to have @xmath55 .",

    "two @xmath56-bins are defined : a low-@xmath56 bin @xmath57 and a high-@xmath56 bin @xmath58 but excluding @xmath59 for the @xmath35 .",
    "more @xmath56 bins are desirable , but are not possible with the current event sample .",
    "the so - called pole region ( @xmath60 ) is excluded due to the @xmath61 term in @xmath62 .",
    "the values of the recent  branching fraction measurements , which combine both @xmath56 bins and lepton - pair cases , and includes correction for the excluded @xmath34 and @xmath35 regions , are :    @xmath63     + @xmath64    figure  [ fig - sllbfs ] shows these results , along with prior measurements from other experiments and two theoretical results based on the sm .",
    "the experimental results are consistent with the sm predictions .",
    ".,width=302 ]      by reconstructing 10 separate submodes for @xmath10 , it becomes possible to construct a variety of decay asymmetries which test different aspects of the process .",
    "direct cp violation , which is expected to be very small in the sm , can be tested by comparing the decay rates for @xmath0 to @xmath65 :    @xmath66 .",
    "the recent  analysis reports :    @xmath67     + @xmath68 .",
    "a lepton - flavor asymmetry ( test of @xmath9-@xmath28 universality ) can be defined by the ratio : @xmath69    models that would enhance @xmath70 , such as susy with a higgs at large @xmath71 , would also enhance @xmath72 somewhat . at the current level of statistics ,",
    "the test is not very restrictive , but is consistent with the sm expectation of unity .",
    "the recent  results are ( for @xmath73 ) :    @xmath74     + @xmath75 .",
    "the most interesting and potentially important recent results address the isospin asymmetry , which compares the decay of neutral to charged @xmath0 s :    @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the ratio of @xmath78 to @xmath79 lifetime .",
    "the value of @xmath80 is expected to be close to zero in the sm , although at low-@xmath56 some deviation is expected ( up to about 10% ) ; in particular , the sign of this deviation depends on the sign of @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig - sllai ] shows the @xmath80 result in the two @xmath56-bins in the recent  analysis .",

    "belle s new results also indicate negative @xmath80 values for @xmath56 below the @xmath34 , but belle observes less pronounced deviations from unity than .",

    "this asymmetry , defined as follows , basically measures the tendency of the @xmath95 to be in the same hemisphere as the @xmath96 when viewed from the dilepton rest frame : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the @xmath2 decay width and @xmath99 is the angle between the @xmath100 and @xmath0 in the @xmath101 rest frame .",
