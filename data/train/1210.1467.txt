    "spin - orbit interactions which are present in quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) semiconductor heterostructures like @xmath7 quantum wires provide a promising way to controllable spin manipulations@xcite . besides the rashba spin - orbit interaction @xmath8 @xcite , which is induced by an electric field , one deals with the linearized dresselhaus spin - orbit interaction @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "these interactions rely on the presence of a structural and crystal inversion symmetry , respectively .",
    "superpositions of such interactions under the influence of transversal@xcite and in - plane magnetic fields@xcite like @xmath10 , have also been discussed . the polar angle between the magnetic field and the @xmath11-axis is denoted by @xmath12 .",
    "the corresponding couplings are denoted by @xmath13 and @xmath14 , in which case the equal coupling strength regime@xcite proceeds via @xmath15 . a typical choice is given by @xmath16 , or equivalently , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 denotes the dimensionless spin - orbit coupling .",
    "equal coupling strength superpositions of such interactions in the presence of in - plane magnetic fields have also been analyzed recently@xcite . in this later case",
    "it has been shown that accounting for spin conservations amounts to the selection of the polar angle along the bisectrices .",
    "having obtained the energy band opens the way to the theoretical derivation of novel spin precession effects , as shown by ( 72 ) in ref .",
    "9 . for this purpose one",
    "proceeds along the lines presented before@xcite , but now by resorting to a different energy band structure .",
    "this amounts to reverse the usual @xmath2-wavenumber dependence of the energy in order to establish two correlated wavenumbers , say @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which are responsible for the description of propagation paths along the @xmath11-axis .",
    "then the two dimensional rotation matrix@xcite one looks for can be established in terms of displacements of length @xmath6 acting along the two paths just referred to above@xcite .",
    "however , several details referring to a systematic study of the parameter dependent spin precession angles are still desirable .",
    "the suitable selection of the @xmath2-parameter deserves a little bit more attention , too .",
    "besides the influence of the discrete parameter @xmath21 , which is responsible for the @xmath22-signs in the front of the square root of the energy , we shall account this time for a further parameter , say @xmath23 , reflecting the rescaling of squared wavenumber via @xmath24 .",
    "handling the parameter dependence of spin precession angles established in this manner amounts to deal with interplays between @xmath2 , @xmath1 , @xmath0 , @xmath25 and @xmath23 , which represents our main motivation in this paper .",
    "so far numerical @xmath2-inputs are introduced via @xmath5 , where @xmath6 denotes specifically the nanometer length scale of the quantum wire model .",
    "forbidden regions can be readily established in terms of selected parameters for which the precession angles are imaginary .",
    "this happens in configurations for which @xmath26 .",
    "complementary intervals should then be responsible for admissible configurations .",
    "the @xmath23-parameter opens the way to extrapolations of the wavenumber towards imaginary and complex values , which looks promising for further generalizations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "preliminaries and notations are discussed in sec .",
    "the present hamiltonian is introduced by neglecting , for convenience , the orbital effects of the magnetic field .",
    "accounting for spin conservations leads to the selection of @xmath27two @xmath12-angles , namely of @xmath28 and @xmath29 in which case @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "then the equal strength limit of the energy can be readily established .",
    "this leads in turn to the displacement momenta @xmath32 @xmath33 serving to the description of two paths one looks for , as indicated in sec .",
    "iii . in sec .",
    "iv one shows that such momenta work safely whenever @xmath34 , but suitable convergence conditions have to be accounted for in so far as @xmath26 .",
    "precession angles established before to first @xmath35-order via @xmath36 are discussed in sec . v. numerical studies concerning these angles are presented in some detail in sec .",
    "vi . section vii deals with imaginary and complex realizations of the @xmath2-parameter .",
    "the conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "viii . mathematical details concerning the derivation of precession angles are shortly reviewed in the appendix .",
    "in order to perform the quantum theoretical description of electronic behavior in two - dimensional ( 2d ) semiconductor heterostructures , single particle hamiltonians@xcite    @xmath37    including the spin - orbit interactions have been proposed .",
    "this time the orbital effects of the magnetic field have been neglected .",
    "the momentum operator reads @xmath38 , whereas @xmath39 stands for the effective mass of the electron .",
    "one has e.g. @xmath40 for @xmath7 quantum wires@xcite , where @xmath41 denotes the usual rest - mass of the electron .",
    "the wire geometry is characterized by a transversal confining potential , say @xmath42 .",
    "the zeeman interaction @xmath43 has also been incorporated , where @xmath44 stands for the bohr - magneton , while @xmath45 denotes the effective gyromagnetic factor . for convenience",
    ", we shall assume that @xmath46 , as usual .    using the total hamiltonian displayed in ( 1 ) leads to commutation relations like    @xmath47 = \\frac{2i\\sigma _ { z}}{\\hbar } \\left ( p_{x}\\pm p_{y}\\right ) \\left ( \\alpha _ { r}\\pm \\alpha _ { d}\\right ) -i\\sigma _ { z}g\\mu _ { b}b\\left ( \\sin \\theta \\mp \\cos \\theta \\right ) \\quad\\ ] ]    which exhibit the zero value",
    "if    @xmath48    so , one gets faced with conserved spin observables like @xmath49 and @xmath50 when the rashba and dresselhaus couplings exhibit the same magnitude , i.e. @xmath31 and @xmath51 respectively .",
    "this proceeds in conjunction with selected in - plane orientations of the magnetic field @xmath52 for which @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively , as displayed above .",
    "the energy eigenvalue problem can be solved by resorting once more again to the zero determinant condition for a homogenous system of two coupled equations , as shown many times before@xcite .",
    "starting from the wavefunction    @xmath55    where @xmath56 stands for the oscillator eigenfunction , yields the 1d - reduction of ( 1 ) as    @xmath57    in which the oscillator eigenvalue reads @xmath58 , as usual ( see e.g.ref . [ 13 ] ) .",
    "now we are ready to apply the zero determinant condition referred to above , which produces the energy    @xmath59 in accord with ( 16 ) in@xcite , where    @xmath60    and where the @xmath22-signs in the front of @xmath61 can also be viewed , in general , as reflecting the influence of the spin@xcite .",
    "we then have to introduce a further parameter like @xmath21 , which will be used hereafter .",
    "accordingly , the lower energy configuration corresponds to @xmath26 .",
    "the corresponding spinorial eigenfunction is given by @xmath62 and @xmath63 , where    @xmath64    the equal strength limit of ( 8) can also be readily performed .",
    "one would then obtain @xmath65 , in accord with ( 3 ) , so that @xmath66 .",
    "this means that @xmath67 @xmath68 if @xmath69 @xmath70 .",
    "accounting for the spin conservation , we have to realize that the symmetrized equal coupling strength limit of the present spin dependent but non - symmetrized energy band ( 6 ) is given by    @xmath71    by virtue of ( 3 ) .",
    "so far , the dimensionless spin - orbit coupling , i.e. @xmath72 , has the magnitude order of unity .",
    "one sees that the linear @xmath1-dependent term under the square root in ( 6 ) is ruled out , which comes definitely from the inter - related equal coupling strength limit one deals with in this paper .",
    "moreover , ruling out the @xmath1-dependent term leads to the conversion of ( 6 ) into a conditionally solvable biquadratic equation in @xmath73 , which serves as a starting point to the derivation of spin precession effects .",
    "rescaled variables like @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 can also be introduced .",
    "numerical studies can then be readily done by starting from @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "we shall also assume that @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "we have to keep in mind that present calculations are sensitive to the numerical selection of @xmath2-parameter .",
    "we have to realize that such selections can be established reasonably via@xmath84 , which yields a typical nanometer length like @xmath85 , when @xmath86 .",
    "however , we have to be aware that other selections , @xmath2-dependent ones included , are conceivable . for convenience",
    ", we shall insert hereafter the wavenumber input @xmath87 , though the choice @xmath88 has been used tentatively before@xcite .",
    "it is also clear that ( 9 ) can be rewritten equivalently as    @xmath89 ^{1/2}\\ ] ]    where @xmath21 , which produces the factorized algebraic equation    @xmath90    where @xmath91 stand implicitly for the roots serving to the description of two propagation paths .",
    "next we shall resort to a further approximation , namely to handle in the sequel the @xmath92-functions in terms of numerical inputs for the @xmath2-parameter .",
    "then we are in a position to establish actually @xmath2-roots one looks for as    @xmath93    where    @xmath94 ^{1/2}}{\\omega _ { 0}^{2}}% > 0\\ ] ]    and    @xmath95    the same job can be done by resorting to numerical energy - inputs , such as indicated by the equation    @xmath96    accordingly , one obtains @xmath87 when @xmath97 .",
    "one remarks that ( 12 ) produces a power series in terms of the convergence condition @xmath98 , which is synonymous to    @xmath99    this inequality is fulfilled automatically if @xmath34 .",
    "however one gets faced with extra conditions like    @xmath100    if @xmath26 , provided that    @xmath101    next , we shall handle ( 17 ) via @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 , where @xmath105 stands for a small parameter .",
    "such conditions are reminiscent to the asymptotic description of nonlinear oscillations@xcite .",
    "the interesting point is that ( 17 ) provides an admissible but finite @xmath1-interval such as given by    @xmath106    in so far as the @xmath73-term is neglected , where    @xmath107    it should be noted that @xmath0 plays this time the role of an input parameter .",
    "conversely , starting from an input @xmath1-parameter leads to two disjoint but admissible semi - infinite @xmath0-intervals like    @xmath108    and    @xmath109    so that ( 18 ) gets converted into    @xmath110    concrete realizations concerning ( 19 ) and ( 23 ) will be presented below .    under such conditions",
    "the leading approximations characterizing ( 12 ) are given by    @xmath111    both for @xmath34 and @xmath26 , where @xmath112 , with the understanding that in the latter case the wavenumber description proceeds in terms of ( 19 ) and ( 23 ) .",
    "displacements of length @xmath6 along the @xmath11-axis can be readily applied by resorting to the orthonormalized spinor    @xmath113    by virtue of ( 4 ) .",
    "this results in a 2d rotation matrix [ 10,11 ] , providing in turn the precession angle as    @xmath114 ^{1/2}\\ ] ]    as shown in the appendix , which proceeds in accord with ( 72 ) in ref .",
    "our main emphasis in this paper is one refs .",
    "9 and 10 , but we have to mention that starting with the idea of the voltage controlled spin precession@xcite , a multitude of spin precession descriptions have also been presented during time@xcite , numerical studies included@xcite .",
    "now we are ready to discuss the parameter dependence of the precession angle in a more systematic manner . inserting @xmath87 ,",
    "provides in turn the @xmath115- and @xmath0-dependence of the precession angle @xmath116 in terms of @xmath117- and @xmath1-inputs respectively .",
    "one finds that @xmath116 is a positive concave function  of @xmath1 and @xmath0 increasing monotonically with @xmath118 and @xmath119 , respectively , in so far as @xmath34 .",
    "however , one gets faced with nontrivial patterns when @xmath26 .",
    "so there are crossing points between @xmath120-plots for @xmath34 and @xmath26 concerning both @xmath1- and @xmath0-dependent curves .",
    "such points are located at    @xmath121    and    @xmath122    respectively .",
    "these points reproduce identically the edge points characterizing the admissible intervals ( 19 ) and ( 23 ) .",
    "it should be noted that both ( 27 ) and ( 28 ) are produced by the basic equation    @xmath123    which has the meaning of a leading approximation .",
    "the upper bounds characterizing the precession angle within the admissible intervals are then given by    @xmath124    and    @xmath125    where @xmath0 and @xmath1 stand for inputs .",
    "other characteristic point of interest are the zeros exhibited by the @xmath26-precession angle on the @xmath1- and @xmath0-axes .",
    "one realizes that such zeros are inter - related with the onset of discontinuity points of  the second kind such that @xmath126 , as displayed in figs . 1 - 4 .",
    "handling this latter equation gives    @xmath127    which yields the solutions    @xmath128    or    @xmath129 ^{1/2}\\right ] ^{1/2}\\in \\widetilde{% i}_{a}(b)\\ ] ]    respectively .",
    "it can be easily verified that the zeros established in this manner get included into the admissible intervals ( 19 ) and ( 23 ) .",
    "we have to remark that the that the zeros of the denominator in ( 31 ) such as given by    @xmath130    produce vertical singularity lines which are asymptotically indistinguishable from supercritical @xmath120-tails for which @xmath131 and @xmath132 , which proceed in connection with @xmath133 and @xmath134 , respectively .",
    "the understanding is that ( 29 ) is a leading approximation which comes from ( 35 ) via @xmath135 .",
    "such vanishingly small strips tails lying outside admissible regions should then be viewed as meaningless artifacts which can be hereafter ignored . under such conditions",
    "one gets faced with a leading approximation for which @xmath136 , which opens the way to a reasonable synthesis of admissible @xmath120-trajectories in pertinent parameter spaces .",
    "after having been arrived at this stage , we are in a position to say that forbidden regions should proceed complementarily in terms of selected parameters for which the imaginary parts of precession angles are non - zero , i.e. for @xmath137 .",
    "it is understood that this latter inequality proceeds in combination with @xmath138 .",
    "such parameters belong to intervals like    @xmath139    and    @xmath140    which are complementary to ( 19 ) and ( 23 ) , respectively .",
    "concrete plots displaying the parameter dependence of precession angles are presented in figs . 1 - 4 .",
    "we have to anticipate that in all these cases the precession angles are positive whenever @xmath34 .",
    "the precession angle is presented in fig . 1 for @xmath17 , @xmath34 ( solid curve ) and @xmath26 ( dashed curve ) .",
    "the crossing points are located at @xmath141 , while the zeros are given by @xmath142 .",
    "the admissible @xmath1-interval is given by @xmath143 , while the forbidden one proceeds via @xmath144 , in accord with the dotted curve in fig .",
    "1 . the horizontal and vertical dotted lines serve to the discrimination of crossing points , and the same concerns figs . 2 - 4 . inserting @xmath145 instead of",
    "@xmath17 leads to similar patterns , as shown in fig .",
    "the crossing points and the zeros are now given by @xmath146 and @xmath147 , respectively .",
    "the admissible interval concerns this time @xmath148 , which is complementary to the forbidden interval @xmath149 in which @xmath150 .",
    "the @xmath0-dependence of the precession angle can be discussed in a rather similar manner .",
    "inserting @xmath151 , leads to typical plots for @xmath34 ( solid curves ) and @xmath26 ( dashed curves ) , which exhibit the crossing points @xmath152 and the zeros @xmath153 , as shown in fig .",
    "3 . however , this time the admissible interval is expressed by two disjoint semi - infinite intervals , i.e. by @xmath154 . the dotted curve concerns this time the forbidden interval @xmath155 .",
    "the @xmath156- counterparts of these plots are displayed in fig .",
    "4 . just note that in this latter case crossing points and zeros are given by @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "next let us rescale the squared wavenumber as    @xmath159    which means that imaginary @xmath160realizations proceed via @xmath161 .",
    "the @xmath23-dependence of @xmath162 can be easily displayed , as shown in fig .",
    "5 for @xmath151 and @xmath17 .",
    "one remarks that the imaginary parts of precession angles , such as indicated by dot - dashed ( @xmath34 ) and dotted ( @xmath26 ) curves , are zero , unless @xmath163 , where @xmath164 .",
    "correspondingly , the real parts of present @xmath120-angles , which are displayed by solid ( @xmath34 ) and dashed ( @xmath26 ) curves , get characterized by a discontinuity point of second kind for which @xmath165 @xmath166 .",
    "the imaginary and real parts obey the symmetry properties    @xmath167    which is valid irrespective of @xmath23 and    @xmath168    working for @xmath169 . a further discontinuity point of second kind is located at @xmath170 , such that @xmath171 , which is similar to the zeros displayed by @xmath172 in figs . 1 - 4 .    a further interesting example concerns the @xmath0-dependence of real parts of precession angles for @xmath151 and @xmath173 , as shown by solid ( @xmath34 ) and dashed ( @xmath26 ) curves in fig . 6 .",
    "dot - dashed ( @xmath34 ) and dotted ( @xmath26 ) curves , which are responsible for the imaginary parts , have again been inserted .",
    "it is clear that now the rescaled wavenumber exhibits the complex form @xmath174 .",
    "just remark the symmetry of present numerical realizations such as given by    @xmath175    and    @xmath176    vertical asymptotes reflecting the influence of crossing points @xmath177 discussed before by virtue of ( 23 ) can also be readily identified .",
    "the present patterns are similar to the ones displayed in fig . 4 , but now one deals with additional imaginary contributions concerning @xmath178 as well as @xmath179 , this time for @xmath180 .",
    "in this paper the parameter dependence of novel spin - precession effects proposed before@xcite has been discussed in some more detail . such effects concern equal coupling strength combinations of rashba and dresselhaus spin - orbit interactions characterized by the dimensionless coupling @xmath0 under the influence of in - plane magnetic fields of magnitude @xmath1 .",
    "the zeeman interaction has been favoured to the detriment of the orbital effects of the magnetic field@xcite .",
    "a related discrete parameter , say @xmath21 , has also accounted for .",
    "the spin precession angle has been derived in terms of suitable @xmath35-expansions proceeding in terms of the convergence condition @xmath98 , which provides nontrivial manifestations .",
    "this condition is fulfilled automatically when @xmath34 , but we have to resort to admissible regions in the parameter space such as given by ( 24 ) and ( 28 ) in so far as @xmath26 , i.e. to @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "to this aim parameter dependent crossing points between precession angles for @xmath34 and @xmath26 , namely @xmath183 @xmath184 and @xmath134 , have been established in an explicit manner .",
    "in addition , the precession angles get characterized by nontrivial zeros like @xmath185 and @xmath186 , which are located specifically within admissible intervals .",
    "it should be mentioned that the precession angles become imaginary within the forbidden intervals @xmath187 and @xmath188 , which are complementary to @xmath189 and @xmath190 , respectively .",
    "meaningless vanishingly small strips starting upwards from @xmath191 and @xmath192 , respectively , have been reasonably ignored .",
    "accordingly , the parameter dependence of the precession angles is characterized by the interplay between admissible and forbidden intervals , as illustrated by figs . 1 - 4 .",
    "extrapolations of the wavenumber towards imaginary and complex values have also been done , as illustrated by figs . 5 and 6 .",
    "such structures may be useful for further developments .",
    "it is clear that starting from admissible intervals , the parameters can be tuned until the real part of the precession angle for @xmath26 becomes zero :    @xmath193    this proceeds via @xmath194 @xmath187 or  @xmath195 .",
    "accordingly , the @xmath26-spin precession effects get ruled out .",
    "this means that such effects are able to be switched off and on , which may serve to the description of further manipulations .",
    "actual zeros of the precession angles can also be approached via @xmath196 and @xmath197 . in other words , one gets faced with nontrivial interplays between admissible and forbidden regions , which stand for the main results obtained in this paper .",
    "so we are in a position to emphasize that such results are able to provide a deeper understanding of novel spin - precession effects characterizing quantum wire models . besides spin - filtering effects@xcite and transport properties@xcite ,",
    "the incorporation of dynamic localization effects@xcite , as well as of time dependent magnetic fields@xcite , deserves further attention .",
