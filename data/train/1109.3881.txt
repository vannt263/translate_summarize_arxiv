    "the properties of a polymer confined in a nanochannel have attracted broad interest @xcite because they are of fundamental relevance in polymer physics and are also related to many biological processes , such as double - stranded dna genomes packaging inside the phage capsid @xcite , polymers transport through nanopore @xcite and viruses injecting their dna into a host cell @xcite .    the importance of cyclic structures in biological macromolecular science is strikingly demonstrated by the existence of circular dna , cyclic peptides and cyclic oligosaccharides and polysaccharides @xcite .",
    "ring closure of a polymer is one of the important factors influencing its statistical mechanical properties .",
    "understanding the static and dynamic properties of ring polymer is a challenging problem due to the difficulties inherent to a systematic theoretical analysis of such objects constrained to a unique topology .",
    "the scaling behavior of isolated , highly diluted , ring polymers has been studied .",
    "des cloizeaux @xcite , deutsch @xcite and grosberg @xcite discussed the effect of topological constraints on the properties of ring polymers , and found that the topological constraint and the excluded volume have similar effects .",
    "the radius of gyration for large single ring polymers obey the same scaling relationship as that of linear chains @xcite , although this is not true for ring polymers in a melt or ring polymer brushes @xcite .",
    "ring closure acts as an important role in a wide range of biophysical contexts where dna is constrained : segregation of the compacted circular genome of some bacteria @xcite , formation of chromosomal territories in cell nuclei @xcite , compaction and ejection of the knotted dna of a virus @xcite , migration of a circular dna in an electrophoresis gel @xcite or in a nanochannel @xcite .",
    "after three decades of intensive research , the conformational properties of a self - avoiding polymer chain confined in a slit or in a cylindrical nanochannel are relatively well understood .",
    "@xcite . however , a deeper understanding of the basic properties of ring polymer in confined environments is a field in its infancy @xcite .",
    "only few studies have addressed semiflexible ring polymers .",
    "@xcite investigated the internal structure of semiflexible ring polymers in weak spherical confinement and found buckling and a conformational transition to a figure eight form .",
    "fritsche and heermann @xcite examined the conformational properties of a semiflexible ring polymer confined to different geometrical constraints and found that the geometry of confinement plays a important role in shaping the spatial organization of polymers .",
    "most recently , we have found the helix chain conformation of flexible ring polymers confined to a cylindrical nanochannel , and demonstrated that the longitudinal size along the channel for a ring polymer scales as @xmath3 , the same as that for a linear chain but with different prefactors .",
    "here @xmath4 is the radius of the channel , @xmath0 the chain length and @xmath5 the kuhn length of the chain @xcite .",
    "we further gives the theoretical ratio value 0.561 of the longitudinal size for a ring polymer and a linear chain of the same @xmath0 .",
    "as to the dynamics of the polymer under confinements , milchev _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have investigated the ejection of linear chain out of nanopore using monte carlo simulation and found that the ejection dynamics depends on the chain length . unlike its linear polymer counterpart , the dynamics of confined ring polymers is still lacking , although many bimolecules are circular . to this end , in this work we study the ejection dynamics of a ring polymer confined in a nanochannel by means of analytical techniques and langevin dynamics simulations .",
    "the basic questions associated with this process are the following : ( a ) what s effect of the chain length and the channel length on the ejection dynamics ?",
    "( b ) what s the difference of the ejection dynamics for ring polymers compared with the linear one ? for a fixed channel , which one is faster compared a ring polymer with a linear chain of the identical length ?",
    "we believe that this work is interesting and important for understanding biological systems with more complexity , such as viruses injecting their dna into a host cell , the behavior of dna inside phages or the spatial organization of the bacterial nucleoid in _",
    "in our numerical simulations , the polymer chains are modeled as bead - spring chains of lennard - jones ( lj ) particles with the finite extension nonlinear elastic ( fene ) potential .",

    "the connectivity between neighboring beads is modeled as a fene spring with @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the distance between consecutive beads , @xmath12 is the spring constant and @xmath13 is the maximum allowed separation between connected beads .    , the channel height @xmath14 and the polymer length @xmath15 . ]",
    "we consider a schematic representation as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where a ring polymer is confined in a cylindrical channel with one end sealed .",
    "the nanochannel and the sealed surface are described by stationary particles within distance @xmath5 from one another which interact with the beads by the repulsive lennard - jones potential .",
    "the particle positions of the nanochannel and the sealed surface are not changed in the simulations .    in the langevin dynamics simulation ,",
    "each bead is subjected to conservative , frictional , and random forces , respectively , with @xcite @xmath16 . here",
    "@xmath17 is the bead s mass , @xmath18 is the friction coefficient , @xmath19 is the bead s velocity , and @xmath20 is the random force which satisfies the fluctuation - dissipation theorem . in the present work ,",
    "the lj parameters @xmath9 , @xmath5 , and @xmath17 fix the system energy , length and mass units respectively , leading to the corresponding time scale @xmath21 and force scale @xmath22 , which are of the order of ps and pn , respectively .",
    "the dimensionless parameters in the model are then chosen to be @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 .    in our model",
    ", each bead corresponds to a kuhn length ( twice of the persistence length ) of a polymer . for a single - stranded dna ( ssdna ) ,",
    "the persistence length of the ssdna is sequence and solvent dependent and varies in a wide range , to our knowledge , usually from about 1 to 4 nm .",
    "we assume the value of @xmath26 nm for a ssdna containing approximately four nucleotide bases .",
    "the average mass of a base in dna is about 312 amu , so the bead mass @xmath27 amu .",
    "we set @xmath28 , which means that the interaction strength @xmath9 is @xmath29 j at actual temperature 295 k. this leads to a time scale of 69.2 ps and a force scale of 1.2 pn .",
    "the langevin equation is then integrated in time by a method described by ermak and buckholz @xcite .",
    "we initially fix the last monomer of the linear chain but anyone of the ring polymer at the sealed bottom of the nanochannel , while the remaining monomers are under thermal collisions described by the langevin thermostat to obtain an equilibrium configuration . in order to learn the mechanism of chain ejection out of the nanochannel ,",
    "the link of the monomer with the bottom of the channel is removed , then the chain is released to diffuse along the channel .",
    "the residence time @xmath30 is measured , once all monomers pass the opening at @xmath31 and leave the channel .",
    "typically , we average our data over 700 independent runs .",
    "according to the blob picture , for a linear polymer confined in a infinitely long three - dimensional nanochannel of diameter @xmath4 , the chain will extend along the channel axis forming a string of blobs of size @xmath4 .",
    "the center of the blob is on the axis of the nanochannel . for each blob , @xmath32 due to the dominant excluded volume effects , where @xmath33 is the number of monomers in a blob , @xmath5 is the kuhn length of the chain",
    ", @xmath34 is the flory exponent in three dimensions , and @xmath35 is a constant .",
    "thus , each blob contains @xmath36 monomers , and the number of blobs is @xmath37 .",
    "the free energy cost for the chain confinement is proportional to the number of blobs , thus the free energy in units of @xmath38 is @xmath39 , with @xmath40 being a constant .",
    "the blob picture then predicts the longitudinal size of the linear chain to be @xmath41 . using @xmath42 in three dimensions , we obtain @xmath43    in order to model the the chain conformation for a ring polymer confined in a nanochannel , we have extended the blob picture @xcite . for a ring polymer",
    ", the chain will extend along the channel axis forming two strings of blobs of @xmath44,the two strings of blobs show helix structure .",
    "for each blob of size @xmath44 , @xmath45 with @xmath46 being the the number of monomers in a blob . here , the same prefactor @xmath35 for ring polymers and linear chains is due to the same solution environment .",
    "thus , each blob contains @xmath47 monomers , and the number of blobs is @xmath48 .",
    "the free energy cost in units of @xmath38 is @xmath49 , with @xmath50 being a constant .    by geometrical analysis , the distance between two successive layers is @xmath51 , and so the total length occupied by blobs in the channel",
    "is @xmath52 .",
    "when @xmath53 is very large , @xmath54 . using @xmath42 in three dimensions ,",
    "we obtain @xmath55    therefore , the longitudinal size along the channel for a ring polymer scales as @xmath56 , the same as that for a linear chain but with a different prefactor .",
    "the ratio of the longitudinal sizes along the nanochannel ( or the prefactors ) for a ring polymer and a linear chain is @xmath57 if using more accurate value of @xmath58 , we have @xmath59 .    the simulation results",
    "@xcite confirm the above predictions and give @xmath60 for the parameters used in the model .",
    "intuitively , for the ejection of a polymer out of a nanochannel , the dynamics is controlled by the relative length of polymer compared with the channel height @xmath61 .",
    "there exists a critical polymer length @xmath62 , where the polymer just fully occupies the channel , namely @xmath63 .",
    "thus , for linear chains the critical length @xmath64 is @xmath65 while for ring polymers the critical length @xmath66 reads @xmath67 the ratio of the critical length for the ring polymers and the linear polymer is @xmath68    short chains with chain length of @xmath2 are initially fully confined in the nanochannel while long polymers with chain length of @xmath69 initially occupy the whole channel with several segments outside the channel exit . for long chains with @xmath69 ,",
    "the ejection is a driven process where the pulling force @xmath70 is from the entropy and is induced by already ejected monomers @xcite . for short chains with @xmath2 ,",
    "polymer needs to move to the channel exit by a diffusive process , and then experiences a pulling force as for long chains .",
    "we assume the ejection process to be quasi - equilibrium . for long chains ,",
    "the pulling force can be estimated from the free energy @xmath71 of a chain partially confined in the nanochannel with the innermost monomer being at distance @xmath72 from the channel exit . for long linear chains , @xmath73 and the free energy @xmath74 , with @xmath75 being the number of monomers inside the channel at time @xmath76 .",
    "the differential of the free energy allows an estimate of the pulling force @xmath77 it is worthy of noting that @xmath70 is independent of the tail length as well as @xmath61 , but inversely proportional to @xmath4 . for long ring chains , @xmath78 and the free energy @xmath79 .",
    "thus , the pulling force @xmath80    we further have the ratio of the pulling force for long ring polymers and linear chains @xmath81 which is only determined by the universal prefactors for ring polymers and linear chains . during the ejection process",
    ", the pulling force induced by the tail is balanced by the total friction .",
    "namely , for long chains we have @xmath82 where @xmath18 is the friction coefficient per monomer .",
    "taking into account the relationship of @xmath83 and @xmath75 , we obtain the ejection time @xmath84 for long linear chains , and @xmath85 for long ring polymers .",
    "therefore , the ratio of the ejection time for long ring polymers and linear chains is @xmath86 where @xmath42 is used .    as noted above , for short polymers ( @xmath87 ) , it undergoes a diffusive process before the first segment exiting the channel , and subsequently the ejection process driven by a pulling force .",
    "accordingly , we divide the total ejection time @xmath30 into two parts , @xmath88 for the diffusive process and @xmath89 for the driven process .    for the the diffusive process of short linear chains , @xmath90 is @xmath91 ^ 2}{2k_bt } , \\label{eq14}\\ ] ] with @xmath92 being the diffusion constant .",

    "according to our above theoretical analysis and simulation results , for ring polymers confined in a cylindrical nanochannel the blob size for ring polymers is smaller than that for linear polymers , which indicates that during the chromosome segregation the driving force for ring polymers is larger than that for linear one , leading to faster segregation .",

    "<S> we investigate the ejection dynamics of a ring polymer out of a cylindrical nanochannel using both theoretical analysis and three dimensional langevin dynamics simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the ejection dynamics for ring polymers shows two regimes like for linear polymers , depending on the relative length of the chain compared with the channel . for long chains with length @xmath0 larger than the critical chain length @xmath1 , at which the chain just fully occupies the nanochannel , </S>",
    "<S> the ejection for ring polymers is faster compared with linear chains of identical length due to a larger entropic pulling force ; while for short chains ( @xmath2 ) , it takes longer time for ring polymers to eject out of the channel due to a longer distance to be diffused to reach the exit of the channel before experiencing the entropic pulling force . </S>",
    "<S> these results can help understand many biological processes , such as bacterial chromosome segregation . </S>"
