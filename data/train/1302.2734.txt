    "lattices are basic algebra that provide a natural way to formalize and study the ordering of objects .",
    "they play an important role in various fields such as mathematics , computer science and engineering@xcite .",
    "for example , they have applications in combinatorics , number theory , group theory , graph theory , set theory and logic circuits .",
    "lattices have binary operations on elements of ( partially ) ordered sets called join ( @xmath0 ) and meet ( @xmath1 ) . by these operations",
    ", we can investigate structure of ordered sets and manipulate elements of them algebraically .",
    "an application of boolean lattice to logic circuits is one of successful case of such manipulation .",
    "meanwhile , there have been numbers of researches on complex dynamical systems that are described by differential equations or difference equations .",
    "most of complex dynamical systems exhibit either stable behavior , periodic behavior , or unpredictable behavior called chaos , depending on initial values and parameter of the systems . to classify the behavior of the systems ,",
    "several entropy - based complexity measures have been proposed and employed@xcite .    in this article",
    ", we propose dynamical systems defined on algebra of lattices , which we call ` lattice equations ' .",
    "we give exact general solutions of initial value problems for a class of lattice equations , and evaluate the complexity of the solutions . since lattice equations are reduced to a certain class of max - plus equations or binary cellular automata ( ca)@xcite when we restrict dependent variables to the ordered set @xmath2 or binary numbers , exact solutions of them apply to max - plus equations and ca . though numerical or statistical studies about the behavior of solutions have been vastly done for max - plus equations and ca , direct evaluation of behavior of solution by means of explicit expressions",
    "is quite few .",
    "therefore , our approach provides a novel viewpoint to analysis of complex dynamical systems , that is , analytical mathematics on lattice equations .",
    "we note our result is related to ultradiscretization procedure in the field of integrable systems that connects discrete max - plus equations , ca , and continuous differential or differences equations@xcite .",
    "the solutions are also directly connected one another through the procedure , though it is mainly found for the integrable systems . in this context",
    ", the lattice equations proposed with exact solutions will be useful in finding wider perspective between continuous and digital systems .",
    "the contents of this article are as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "lattice ] , we first introduce the general definition of lattice and define a class where the complexity of their solutions are of polynomial order . secondly we introduce the definition of elementary cellular automata ( eca ) and show the relation between lattice equations and eca . in section  [ sec : solution ] , we show a list of lattice equations of the above class together with their exact solutions . in section  [ sec : asymptotic ] , we show some examples analyzing the asymptotic behavior of eca using the exact solutions . in section  [ sec : conclusion ] , we give concluding remarks . in [ sec : list ] , we give a list of the lattice equations and corresponding eca which are equivalent to each other under the transformation of variables . in [ sec : proof ] , we give some proofs about the solutions listed in section  [ sec : solution ] .",

    "if we use the above equation recursively , we obtain the formal solution expressed by @xmath32 as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is defined recursively by @xmath35 however this solution contains @xmath36 terms of @xmath32 and it does not give any information on the solution since it is formal . in this article , we show the list of evolution equations with a general solution containing the terms @xmath32 of which the number is of polynomial order .",
    "if the solution @xmath37 can be expressed by the @xmath38 terms among @xmath30 , let us classify as the equation is of class @xmath39 ( polynomial class of order @xmath40 ) .",
