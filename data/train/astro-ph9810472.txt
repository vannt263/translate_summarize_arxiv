    "320  ( ) and the young pulsar psr  are one of the best - studied but least - understood pulsar / supernova remnant ( snr ) pairings .",
    "we here summarise the results of a new radio study of this system ; this work is discussed in more detail by gaensler et al ( 1998 ) .",
    "existing radio and x - ray images of 320  are shown in figure  [ fig_most_rosat ] .",
    "the radio image shows two distinct components : a bright centrally - condensed source to the north ( coincident with the optical nebula ) , and a fainter filamentary arc to to the south . in x - rays three bright sources are apparent :",
    "the pulsar itself , a surrounding non - thermal pulsar - powered nebula ( a `` plerion '' ) , and thermal emission from the  region .      the distance of 4.2  kpc determined for  through absorption ( caswell et al 1975 ) is roughly consistent with the pulsar s dispersion - measure distance of @xmath06  kpc .",
    "however the ages of the pulsar and snr are hard to reconcile : assuming standard supernova and ism parameters results in an age for the snr in the range @xmath1  yr ( seward et al 1983 ) , much older than the pulsar s spin - down age of @xmath2  yr ( kaspi et al 1994 )",
    ".    on the other hand , an association is favoured by the possibility that the pulsar may be interacting with the  region through a collimated relativistic outflow ( seward et al 1983 ; manchester & durdin 1983 ; tamura et al 1996 ; brazier & becker 1997 ) .",
    "there are two main problems with this argument , however .",
    "firstly , the total thermal energy in  exceeds the _ entire _  energy lost by the pulsar over its lifetime for any but very rapid initial periods .",
    "secondly , the mechanism by which a large thermal nebula might be created at the termination of such an outflow is unclear .",
    "320  is not a typical , roughly circular , shell snr .",
    "some of the possible explanations for its unusual morphology are that it is actually multiple remnants , that its appearance is the result of expansion into a complicated environment , or that an outflow from the pulsar ( see  [ sec_assoc ] ) has distorted its shape .",
    "we have carried out extensive observations of the region with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) .",
    "the main results are as follows :    *  absorption is consistent with all radio components of 320  being at a distance  kpc ( psr  is too weak to obtain  absorption against ) .",
    "* in the region surrounding psr  , radio emission from 320   is highly linearly polarised ( @xmath060% ) and has the same rotation measure as the pulsar .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig_atca_pspc ] , within this plateau of emission is a channel of reduced radio emission which closely follows a collimated x - ray feature ( part of the plerion powered by psr  ) . + * at high resolution , the radio peak of  forms a ring of linearly polarised knots of spectral index @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) . the radio and x - ray morphologies of the region are compared in figure  [ fig_hri ] , where it can be seen that there is a marked correspondence between the two wavebands .",
    "the radio emission seen near the pulsar in figure  [ fig_atca_pspc ] has a distinctly high fractional polarisation , has the same rotation measure as the pulsar , and shows an anti - correspondence with x - ray emission associated with the plerion .",
    "thus it seems certain that this radio emission is in some way connected with the pulsar .",
    "we would argue that this region is not radio emission from the plerion itself , since the radio emission is not centred on the pulsar , nor are the x - ray bright regions bright in the radio .",
    "indeed any radio plerion is expected to be too faint to be detectable ( e.g.  seward et al 1984 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig_atca_pspc ] demonstrates that radio emission is enhanced along the sides of the collimated x - ray feature but not within it .",
    "this anti - correspondence can be explained if the x - ray feature is a focussed relativistic jet or outflow , as has been argued by brazier & becker ( 1997 ) .",
    "radio emission is then produced by shocks generated in a cylindrical sheath around the jet , as seen for ss 433 ( hjellming & johnston 1986 , 1988 ) and possibly for the jet in vela  x ( frail et al 1997 ) .",
    "the polarisation and spectral index of the knots in figure  [ fig_hri ] indicate that at least in the radio , their emission mechanism is synchrotron .",
    "the x - ray / radio correspondence suggests that the x - ray emission from these knots might also be synchrotron , and indeed a single power law can be extrapolated from their radio flux densities through to those measured by _ rosat _",
    "although in x - rays the  region as a whole is thermal , a power - law spectrum from the knots could easily be hidden within .",
    "the problems raised in  [ sec_assoc ] involving an outflow from the pulsar can be resolved if these compact synchrotron knots are interpreted as the point of interaction between the pulsar outflow and the snr .",
    "the energy in these knots can be easily accommodated by the pulsar spin - down , and it is easier to see how these features , rather than the whole extended  nebula , might be the termination of the energetic outflow",
    ". the rest of the  region may be part of the snr blast wave .",
    "correspondences between the discrete radio components of 320and the overall x - ray remnant , together with the results of  absorption , argue that 320  is a single snr .",
    "its agreement in rotation measure with psr  , and the evidence seen in figures  [ fig_atca_pspc ] and [ fig_hri ] for outflow and interaction respectively , make a strong case that snr  320  and psr  are associated .    if the snr and pulsar are indeed associated , then the age discrepancy between them must somehow be resolved .",
    "we find that a consistent picture of a system of age 1700  yr can be constructed if a supernova of high energy or low mass ( @xmath5 ) occurred near the edge of an elongated cavity . as well as the snr s large apparent age",
    ", this model can also explain the two well - separated components of the remnant s radio morphology , the significant offset of the pulsar from the snr s centre and the faintness of any plerion at radio wavelengths ( see gaensler et al 1998 for a detailed discussion of this model ) .",
    "observations with the atca have resulted in the following main conclusions :    1 .   the radio components of 320  are all part of a single snr at a distance @xmath6  kpc and with an age @xmath71700  yr .",
    "psr  is physically associated with 320 .",
    "the pulsar emits twin jets or collimated outflows of relativistic particles .",
    "one of these jets is seen as a collimated x - ray feature surrounded by a polarised radio sheath , while the other interacts with the snr in the form of radio / x - ray knots within . 3 .",
    "snr  320  was formed in a supernova of high kinetic energy or low ejected mass ( @xmath5 ) which occurred near the edge of a low - density cavity .",
    "a variety of further observations can support or refute these claims .",
    "for example , the cavity we propose may be visible in  emission , while forthcoming _ axaf _",
    "observations will allow a detailed study of the physical conditions within the knots .",
    "while we have side - stepped the details of how pulsar jets might be generated and how they interact with the snr , it seems that psr  can now join the crab , vela and possibly psr  b1951 + 32 in showing evidence for collimated outflows ; evidence is mounting that spherically symmetric pulsar winds are a gross over - simplification .",
