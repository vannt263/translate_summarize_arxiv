    "a common practice in quantifying bayesian uncertainty is to construct credible regions ( or sets ) that cover a large fraction of posterior mass .",
    "the construction is built upon posterior distribution whose asymptotic behavior is characterized by bernstein - von mises ( bvm ) theorem . as a consequence of bvm theorem , bayesian credible sets may asymptotically possess frequentist validity , which is called as bernstein - von mises phenomenon in @xcite .",
    "in nonparametric settings , a bvm result was initially found _ impossible _ by @xcite .",
    "an essential reason for this failure is due to the lack of flexibility in the assigned priors . in the paper",
    ", we introduce a novel _ tuning prior _ under which bvm phenomenon can be estblished in a general class of nonparametric regression models .",
    "more interestingly , this type of prior connects two important classes of statistical methods : nonparametric bayes and smoothing spline .",
    "this coupling effect is practically useful .",
    "for example , a proper tuning prior can be selected through generalized cross validation ( gcv ) .",
    "as far as we are aware , bvm results are only shown to be valid in various special settings .",
    "for instance , in gaussian sequence models ( equivalently , gaussian white noise models ) , bvm theorem has been established for mean sequences ( or signals ) ; see @xcite . in gaussian regression with fixed design , @xcite proposed adaptive credible regions for regression functions ; with random design , @xcite proposed credible sets under sieved priors . in models where efficient estimation ( at @xmath0-rate ) is possible , @xcite proposed credible intervals for functionals of an infinite - dimensional parameter . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "establishment of bvm theorem ( together with bvm phenomenon ) in a more general framework remains an open problem .",
    "our major goal in this paper is to develop a general bvm framework that deals with both gaussian and non - gaussian data in a unified manner .",
    "moreover , our results allow random design , and are valid even when efficient estimation is unavailable .",
    "we propose a type of tuning prior whose distribution is governed by a ( non - random ) hyper - parameter . in particular , the proposed prior controls the magnitude of higher - order derivatives of regression functions , and therefore , has a natural association with the roughness penalty in smoothing spline . in fact , their precise relation can be discovered by an application of hjek s lemma ( @xcite ) .",
    "an interesting finding is that the tuning prior is induced by a particular type of gaussian process ( gp ) ( different from the sieved prior considered by @xcite ) through a radon - nikodym derivative . in the special gaussian regression , these gaussian processes match with the sequence priors considered in @xcite .",
    "thus , our tuning prior can be viewed as an extension of @xcite to the more general bayesian nonparametric framework .",
    "the above discussions imply duality relation between the resulting posterior distribution and the penalized likelihood in the smoothing spline literature .",
    "therefore , we are able to establish bvm results in a nonparametric exponential family by borrowing recent smoothing spline inference results ( @xcite ) .",
    "this also justifies the use of gcv method in selecting a proper tuning of prior .",
    "we want to remark that our new methodology is different from empirical bayes approach , and supported by our simulation results .",
    "our bvm theorem holds in total variation distance , extending that obtained by @xcite in gaussian white noise . as a consequence ,",
    "we construct _ exact _ credible regions for the regression function under both strong and weak topology , and _ exact _ credible intervals for its linear functionals , e.g. , its local value .",
    "furthermore , the frequentist behaviors of these regions / intervals are carefully investigated .",
    "for instance , when the tuning parameter is carefully chosen , the frequentist coverage of the credible set approaches one given any credibility level , called as weak bvm phenomenon .",
    "the overly conservativeness of credible sets can be resolved by invoking a weaker topology ( inspired by @xcite ) .",
    "this leads to the so - called strong bvm phenomenon .",
    "in contrast , the bvm theorem developed by @xcite is in terms of a weaker metric , i.e. , bounded lipschitz metric , and crucially relies on the _ efficiency _ of nonparametric estimate ( @xcite ) .",
    "other relevant bvm theorems include @xcite for semi / nonparametric models or functionals of the density .",
    "an intermediate step in developing our bvm theorem is to derive posterior contraction rates under a type of sobolev norm , which can be counted as another contribution .",
    "this sobolev norm is stronger than the commonly used metrics in deriving contraction rates such as kullback - leibler divergence , hellinger distance and supremum norm ( @xcite ) .",
    "the reproducing kernel hilbert space ( rkhs ) theory , uniformly consistent test arguments ( @xcite ) together with cameron - martin theorem @xcite and gaussian correlation inequality @xcite are applied to derive this new result .",
    "a relevant result is @xcite who derive contraction rates for higher - order derivatives in gaussian regression .",
    "it is worth mentioning that our contraction rate result does not rely on posterior consistency or posterior boundedness in contrast with @xcite .",
    "the rest of this article is organized as follows . in section [ sec : nonbay ] , we present a general nonparametric exponential framework including gaussian regression and logistic regression , and section  [ sec : pos ] constructs the tuning prior that ties nonparametric bayes models and smoothing spline models . section [ sec :",
