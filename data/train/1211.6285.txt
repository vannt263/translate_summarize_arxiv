    "strangeness production via various scattering processes has been one of the most important issues in hadronic and nuclear physics for decades . from them",
    ", we can understand the microscopic mechanism of the productions beyond the light - flavor sectors and extend our knowledge into multistrangeness states . in this sense ,",
    "photoproduction of strange hadrons off the nucleon target is a very useful tool and has been widely studied experimentally as well as theoretically . for example , experiments for the photoproduction of @xmath18 and @xmath19 were reported in refs .",
    "related theoretical studies were also performed in refs .",
    "in particular , ref .",
    "@xcite emphasized the baryon - resonance contributions , which play important roles in reproducing the experimental data .",
    "the effects of the electromagnetic form factor  @xcite were also investigated for the photo- and electroproduction of the kaon , the ward - takahashi ( wt ) identity being explained .",
    "it was also pointed out that the tensor - meson exchange in the @xmath17 channel provides a significant contribution to kaon photoproduction  @xcite .",
    "an unbiased model selection , based on bayesian inference , was introduced for extracting physical information from kaon photoproduction  @xcite .",
    "references  @xcite examined the @xmath17-channel regge trajectories to enhance the model applicabilities to actual problems .",
    "photoproduction of the vector strange meson @xmath20 provides even richer physics in comparison with the @xmath21 channel .",
    "for instance , since it is a vector meson with quantum number @xmath22 , the exchange of the strange scalar meson @xmath23 is allowed in the @xmath17 channel , which is absent in the @xmath21 channel , in addition to @xmath24 exchanges . moreover , the polarization of the @xmath25 meson in the final state can be taken as an important subject to be investigated together with other polarization observables in terms of the spin - density matrices .",
    "experimentally , this production channel has been investigated for @xmath26 by the clas collaboration at the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ( jefferson lab )  @xcite , and @xmath27 by the cbelsa / taps collaboration at the electron stretcher and accelerator ( elsa )  @xcite , by the clas collaboration  @xcite , and by the leps collaboration at super photon ring-8 gev ( spring-8 )  @xcite .",
    "these two processes have been extensively studied theoretically within the effective lagrangian approaches  @xcite , as well as in the chiral quark model  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , it was argued that the @xmath23-exchange should play an important role in the production mechanism of @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "interestingly enough , the recent leps experiment reported the experimental data that supported the importance of the scalar - meson exchange indeed  @xcite .",
    "moreover , employing the same theoretical framework , ref .",
    "@xcite showed that there were some contributions from nucleon resonances to reproduce the experimental data of @xmath29 .",
    "considering all these successful and meaningful theoretical results accumulated so far within the effective lagrangian method with the resonance contributions taken into account , we want to explore carefully the reaction processes @xmath30 and @xmath31 in the present work . although the @xmath32 photoproduction was already studied theoretically within a similar framework in ref .",
    "@xcite , we will include various baryon - resonance contributions which were proven to be essential in the @xmath14 channel  @xcite .",
    "thus , we introduce the baryon resonances as follows : @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 in the @xmath33 channel and @xmath34 in the @xmath35 channel , in addition to the @xmath33 channel with @xmath36- and @xmath15-pole contributions ; the @xmath17 channel with @xmath23- , @xmath16- , and @xmath25-exchange contributions ; and the @xmath35 channel with @xmath37- and @xmath38-pole contributions .",
    "these resonance contributions have not been taken into account in the previous theoretical work  @xcite and will be treated in a fully relativistic manner in the present work , as done for the @xmath29  @xcite .    the coupling strengths for strong and electromagnetic ( em )",
    "vertices are computed by using experimental and theoretical information  @xcite . in order to preserve the wt identity",
    ", we employ the gauge - invariant form factor prescription given in refs .",
    "the cutoff parameters for the form factors are determined in such a way that the experimental data are reproduced . with these parameters",
    "fixed , we compute the total ( @xmath39 ) and differential cross sections @xmath40 for the @xmath41 processes . in addition , the single - polarization observables such as those for the photon - beam @xmath42 , target @xmath43 , recoil baryon @xmath44 , are presented as useful theoretical guides for available and future experiments .",
    "based on the present results , we observe that the resonance contributions play a minor role in producing the strength of the cross sections , being different from the @xmath14 photoproduction . on the other hand , it turns out that the @xmath15-pole diagram and @xmath16 exchange in the @xmath17 channel are dominant in explaining the production mechanism of @xmath45 .",
    "the present work is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we explain the general formalism of the effective lagrangian methods and show how to fix various model parameters such as the coupling constants and the cutoff masses .",
    "the numerical results are presented and discussed in sec .",
    "the last section is devoted to the summary , conclusion , and future perspectives .",

    "we assign these two production processes as the @xmath54 and @xmath55 channels , respectively , from now on .",
