    "a measurement of the continuum production of meson pairs in two - photon reactions provides a test of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) for exclusive processes@xcite . the leading order result based on perturbative",
    "qcd has been calculated by brodsky and lepage@xcite for large center - of - mass scattering angle @xmath4 and large invariant mass @xmath5 of the two - photon system .",
    "extensions of this work to finite values of @xmath6 ( the invariant mass of the virtual photon ) for one or both of the photons , as well as the incorporation of su(3 ) flavor symmetry breaking effects are discussed by gunion , miller , and sparks@xcite , and benayoun and chernyak@xcite respectively .",
    "a calculation of the next - to - leading - order qcd prediction based on a particular model of the meson distribution amplitude is discussed by nii ' c@xcite , while the running of @xmath7 in the calculation of the meson form factor , and the subsequent effect on the leading order qcd result for @xmath8 is discussed by ji and amiri@xcite .",
    "the subject of this article is a measurement of the two - photon production of @xmath9 and @xmath10 using the cleo  ii detector located at the cornell electron storage ring ( cesr ) .",
    "the leading order result calculated by brodsky and lepage@xcite can be expressed , approximately , in terms of the cross section for the two - photon production of muon pairs : @xmath11 the angle @xmath4 denotes the scattering angle of one of the charged particles ( `` prongs '' ) with respect to the @xmath3 collision axis , calculated in the @xmath3 center - of - mass frame .",
    "the overall angular dependence of eq .",
    "( [ eq : brodsky ] ) is @xmath12 when one folds in the muon pair cross section .",
    "the form factor @xmath13 depends on the strong coupling constant @xmath7 , the @xmath3 invariant mass @xmath5 , and the pseudoscalar decay constant @xmath14 .",
    "it is taken to be @xmath15 for pions@xcite .",
    "a residual dependence on the pseudoscalar wavefunction outside of the form factor dependence is ignored by eq .",
    "( [ eq : brodsky ] ) , and leads to a @xmath16 negative correction .",
    "this model dependent correction is significantly larger for the neutral mesons .",
    "since the form factor is proportional to @xmath17 , the ratio of the kaon pair cross section to the pion pair cross section depends on @xmath18@xcite when differences in the @xmath19 and @xmath20 wavefunctions are ignored .",
    "benayoun and chernyak@xcite argue that such su(3 ) flavor symmetry breaking effects are important and obtain a ratio closer to unity , but their absolute prediction for the combined pion pair plus kaon pair cross section does not differ appreciably from that of brodsky and lepage .",
    "the insensitivity of the combined cross section for charged pion and kaon pairs to the choice of wavefunction models makes this measurement an ideal probe of leading order perturbative qcd .",
    "both the mark  ii and the tpc / two - gamma collaborations have published results@xcite on the high mass two - photon continuum production of charged pion and kaon pairs using the pep @xmath21 storage ring at slac .",
    "mark  ii data on the combined @xmath9 and @xmath10 cross section , measured in the dipion mass range between 1.7 and 3.5  gev/@xmath1 , suggest agreement with leading order qcd at values of @xmath22 larger than 2  gev/@xmath1 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "tpc / two - gamma data on the @xmath10 production cross section show reasonable agreement with the leading order qcd prediction in the measured @xmath5 range from 1.3 to 3.5  gev/@xmath1 for @xmath24 .",
    "charged pion pair data are about 3 times larger than the leading order qcd prediction for @xmath5 measured from 1.5 to 2.5  gev/@xmath1 and @xmath25 , but at least some of the excess is likely to be caused by the interference of the @xmath26 resonance with the @xmath9 continuum . the leading order perturbative qcd calculations become more reliable at large @xmath5 , so the experimental goal of a measurement of these two - photon processes is to probe larger values of @xmath5 than previously obtained using higher statistics to observe the transition in the cross section from non - perturbative to perturbative behavior .",
    "we report on a measurement of the combined cross section for charged pion and kaon pairs using the cleo  ii detector at cesr .",
    "the measurement takes advantage of a much larger data sample than available at previous experiments , as well as a larger angular acceptance ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the cross section is reported in the @xmath22 range from 1.5 to 5.0  gev/@xmath1 using 1.23  @xmath0 of integrated luminosity at a center - of - mass energy on or near the @xmath27 resonance ( @xmath28  gev ) .",
    "a related study on the two - photon production of proton - antiproton pairs has recently been reported@xcite .",
    "the cleo  ii detector@xcite is a general purpose solenoidal detector designed to make precision measurements of both charged and neutral particles .",
    "charged particle tracking is accomplished through the use of a 51 layer proportional drift chamber accompanied by a 10 layer intermediate wire chamber and a 6 layer straw tube chamber located just outside of the beryllium beam pipe . the transverse momentum resolution achieved within the 1.5  t field provided by the solenoidal magnet",
    "is given by @xmath29 , with @xmath30 expressed in gev/@xmath31 .",
    "the tracking system is surrounded by both a time - of - flight scintillation system , consisting of 64 counters arranged in @xmath32 ( the azimuthal coordinate transverse to the beam axis ) plus 28 counters per endcap , and an electromagnetic calorimeter composed of 7800 thallium - doped cesium iodide ( csi ) crystals .",
    "the barrel section of the csi calorimeter forms an integral part of this analysis as the fine tower segmentation allows for particle discrimination based on an analysis of shower shapes .",
    "the projective crystals are approximately 5  cm square at the front end and 30  cm long .",
    "the measured electromagnetic energy resolution is given by @xmath33 , with @xmath34 expressed in gev .",
    "all of these detector components lie within the 1.5  t superconducting solenoidal coil , which is in turn surrounded by 3 layers of iron interleaved with 3 sets of tracking chambers for muon detection .",
    "each tracking chamber set contains three planar layers of iarocci tubes with cathode strips providing information on the coordinate orthogonal to the wires .",
    "the barrel muon system is octagonal in cross section and the angular acceptance of the innermost superlayer is @xmath35 ( @xmath36 is polar angle measured with respect to the beam axis )",
    ".      the trigger forms one of the more challenging aspects of an analysis of low multiplicity final states since it must meet the conflicting demands of high efficiency yet large discrimination against beam - wall and beam - gas backgrounds .",
    "the components of the cleo  ii detector used for this purpose include the tracking chambers , time - of - flight scintillation counters , and calorimeter crystals  all of which are combined into a three level trigger system.@xcite    the two - prong trigger used in this analysis is designed to collect events containing either two minimum ionizing particles or at least one showering particle ( electron or photon ) .",
    "the requirements of this trigger are the following : first , the time - of - flight system must register hits in at least two non - adjacent barrel scintillation counters .",
    "second , the csi calorimeter must identify either two separated energy clusters consistent with minimum ionizing particles ( @xmath37  gev of deposited energy ) , or one energy cluster consistent with a showering particle ( @xmath38  gev of deposited energy ) .",
    "third , the tracking chambers must exhibit two clean track patterns such that the momentum transverse to the beam direction ( @xmath30 ) of one track is at least 0.4  gev/@xmath31 , while that of the other is at least 0.2  gev/@xmath31 .",
    "the exact trigger specification depends on the running period of the experiment , but at least one of the tracks must extend radially through the entire drift chamber .",
    "several methods were devised to measure the two - prong trigger efficiency from data .",
    "one technique makes use of events that satisfy a looser ( prescaled ) trigger to measure the efficiency of the additional trigger conditions in the standard two - prong trigger .",
    "another technique exploits the redundancy of a calorimeter - only trigger to measure the efficiency of the tracking components of the two - prong trigger .",
    "finally , a third technique uses four - prong events where two tracks are sufficient to fire the two - prong trigger .",
    "the trigger efficiency of the remaining two tracks is then studied .",
    "all three techniques are in very good agreement on the efficiency of those trigger components that are in common .",
    "the measured trigger efficiencies are listed separately for each trigger system in table  [ tab : trigger ] .",
    "the measurements refer to the average efficiency for two - prong events in the fiducial region @xmath39 and with each track satisfying @xmath40  gev/@xmath31 .",
    "when all trigger conditions are applied , the overall trigger efficiency for charged pion and kaon pairs is estimated to be 79% or 86% depending upon the running period of the experiment .",
    "a monte carlo simulation of the trigger system , calibrated to an independent data sample , confirms these values to within 5% .",
    "therefore , the systematic uncertainty on the trigger efficiency is estimated to be 5% .",
    "the two - prong trigger runs at a rate of approximately 7  hz at a luminosity of @xmath41 .",
    "all of the events collected by the cleo  ii trigger are fed into a software filter to remove obvious beam - gas and beam - wall backgrounds .",
    "this filter initially ran offline for the first 500  @xmath42 of data used in this analysis , but presently runs online as a part of the trigger system .",
    "it makes extensive use of all the tracking devices to reject events without clean track patterns originating from the nominal interaction point .",
    "its efficiency can be measured directly from data since a prescaled sample of rejected events is saved for analysis , but the efficiency can also be determined by applying the filter to monte carlo events . for two - photon two - prong events , this efficiency is roughly 95% .",
    "in this section we address the details of the analysis techniques used to extract the cross section for the two - photon production of charged pion and kaon pairs .",
    "first , the details of the event generation and detector simulation are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : mc ] .",
    "second , the event shape cuts used to select two - photon events from the data sample are described in sec .",
    "[ sec : selection ] ; and third , a technique for suppressing the large muon background in the two - photon event sample using information from the csi calorimeter is presented in sec .  [",
    "sec : rejection ] .",
    "the extraction of the measured cross section for @xmath8 ( @xmath43 ) relies on an accurate calculation of the qed process @xmath44 .",
    "rather than use the formulae of the equivalent photon approximation , which overestimates the @xmath3 luminosity by about 15% in the @xmath5 range reported in this article , we rely on a monte carlo generator based on the formalism of budnev  _ et  al._@xcite only transverse photon polarization states are considered .",
    "the hadron component of each nearly real photon is modeled by a @xmath45-pole form factor .",
    "the small but finite @xmath6 values of each photon cause these form factors to suppress the @xmath3 luminosity by approximately 30% for the kinematic range explored by this experiment .    the event generation is completed by incorporating the brodsky and lepage@xcite qcd model for @xmath8 ; but for simplicity , the explicit @xmath12 dependence of eq .",
    "( [ eq : brodsky ] ) is replaced with a flat @xmath46 dependence .",
    "the total angular integral over @xmath46 is scaled to the appropriate prediction of eq .",
    "( [ eq : brodsky ] ) .",
    "the event generation is carried out separately for several ranges of @xmath5 ; each sample represents in excess of 2.9  @xmath0 of integrated luminosity .",
    "the rest of the monte carlo simulation involves tracking the generated particles through a detector simulation package based on geant@xcite . in an effort to simulate noise in the detector elements ,",
    "random events selected by a dedicated trigger are embedded into the monte carlo sample . after a simulation of the trigger logic",
    "is performed , the events are then reconstructed in exactly the same manner as for data .",
    "the accuracy of most of the components of the event simulation is demonstrated in sec .",
    "[ sec : calibration ] by the comparison with two calculable qed processes .",
    "the @xmath47 final state system arises from the collision of quasi - real photons radiated by the electrons .",
    "since the electrons typically scatter at very small angles , they generally go unmeasured in the experiment .",
    "likewise , the @xmath3 collision axis is nearly coincident with the electron beam axis , leaving the event @xmath30 unchanged .",
    "the energies of the radiated photons are not equal in general , so typically the final state system is lorentz boosted with respect to the laboratory .",
    "the event selection cuts employed exploit these general features of two - photon scattering at @xmath21 colliders to suppress the large background of annihilation events .",
    "exactly two oppositely charged particles consistent with originating from the interaction point ( within 5  mm transverse to the beam direction and 5  cm along it ) are required to leave tracks in the drift chambers .",
    "the scalar sum of the two track momenta must be less than 8  gev/@xmath31 to suppress qed events , and the total amount of energy deposited in the electromagnetic calorimeter must be less than 8  gev ( the beam energy is approximately 5.3  gev ) .",
    "a total of 6.3 million triggered events survive these preselection cuts .",
    "as two - photon events tend to be well balanced in @xmath30 , a cut is imposed to require that the total charged transverse momentum of the event be less than 200  mev/@xmath31 .",
    "annihilation produced tau events ( @xmath48 ) , one of the principal backgrounds to this measurement , tend not to satisfy this requirement owing to the missing momentum carried away by the neutrinos .",
    "( the expected level of tau pair contamination is addressed in sec .",
    "[ sec : bknd ] . )",
    "a cut is similarly imposed to require that the two tracks be opposite in @xmath32 to within 50  mrad . to further ensure that there are no undetected particles other than the scattered electrons , the polar angle of the missing momentum vector of the event must point to within @xmath49 of the beam axis .",
    "cosmic rays often trigger the experiment and may be classified as two - photon events if they pass near the interaction point .",
    "to reduce their contamination , as well as the contamination from annihilation events , the two tracks must pass an acolinearity requirement : the angle between the two tracks must be more than 100  mrad away from back - to - back . finally , the two tracks are required to project to well understood regions of the detector and must fire a two - track trigger .",
    "the angular cut is @xmath39 for each track .",
    "this directly restricts the angular acceptance in the @xmath3 center - of - mass frame , and a cut is made to select events with @xmath24 since there is little acceptance outside this range . with all event shape requirements applied , the data sample is reduced to 488,000 events .",
    "events containing electrons are suppressed by cutting on the quantity @xmath50 .",
    "since electrons will deposit most of their energy in the csi calorimeter , the ratio of the energy deposit @xmath51 to the magnitude of the momentum @xmath52 will peak at 1.0 .",
    "a cut is made to select only events with tracks satisfying @xmath53 .",
    "events with neutral energy observed in the detector are also rejected by requiring that the total amount of energy in the csi calorimeter unassociated with tracks , @xmath54 , be less than 500  mev .",
    "both barrel and endcap calorimeter energy clusters are considered .",
    "events with explicitly reconstructed @xmath55s in them  identified as having two unmatched , isolated showers of at least 50  mev in energy that combine to within 15  mev/@xmath1 of the nominal @xmath55 mass  are also rejected .",
    "this leaves 172,000 events satisfying all cuts but the muon rejection criteria to be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : rejection ] .",
    "table  [ tab : evtshape ] summarizes all cuts used in the two - prong selection .",
    "charged pions and kaons can be separated by @xmath56 or time - of - flight measurements .",
    "unfortunately , the flight times for pions and kaons merge to within experimental uncertainty for momenta greater than about 1.2  gev/@xmath31 using the cleo  ii time - of - flight system .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath56 energy loss bands using the cleo  ii drift chamber cross at about 1.0  gev/@xmath31 , and are only separable at the @xmath57 level for momenta larger than about 2.0  gev/@xmath31 .",
    "because of these limitations , pions and kaons will not be separated , and a combined cross section will be reported .",
    "thus , the ratio of the @xmath10 to @xmath9 cross sections can not be measured , and this forfeits one test of the @xmath8 models .",
    "the two - photon production of proton - antiproton pairs is negligible owing to the steep @xmath5 dependence of the cross section@xcite .",
    "the primary challenge of the measurement of the two - photon production of charged pion and kaon pairs is to reduce the enormous two - photon background of muon pairs .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : brodsky ] ) predicts that the meson pair cross section will have an extra @xmath58 dependence relative to the @xmath59 cross section , becoming several orders of magnitude smaller for @xmath5 of a few gev/@xmath1 .",
    "muons can be identified by their penetration to a set of tracking chambers located outside several interaction lengths of material .",
    "this can be accomplished with the cleo  ii muon chamber system ; however , muons must have a momentum @xmath60  gev/@xmath31 in order to penetrate the first layer of iron and produce hits in at least the first set of tracking layers .",
    "this restricts @xmath5 to be larger than approximately 2  gev/@xmath1 for adequate muon rejection .",
    "in addition , the acceptance loss in requiring both tracks to project sufficiently far from the cracks in the muon chamber system to limit the uncertainty due to multiple scattering is approximately 50% .",
    "an alternative method of separating muons from hadrons capitalizes on the different energy deposit patterns within the csi calorimeter .",
    "it has the advantage of full azimuthal coverage ( no cracks ) and lower momentum reach , but it must be accomplished using the limited depth of the electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "muons typically leave a narrow trail of ionization and lose little energy as they traverse the 30  cm depth of the calorimeter .",
    "hadrons , too , generally pass right through since the electromagnetic calorimeter is only about an interaction length deep .",
    "occasionally , though , a pion or kaon will suffer an inelastic collision and deposit a significant amount of energy over a large lateral area .",
    "the energy deposited in the csi calorimeter and the lateral shower size can be used to tag one of the mesons within two - prong events and thus suppress the muon pair background .",
    "the lateral shower size is computed by calculating the root - mean - square ( rms ) width of the shower relative to the shower center - of - gravity .",
    "the center - of - gravity is computed by finding the energy - weighted mean of the locations of each crystal within all matched energy clusters , where the matching algorithm includes all showers within about 30  cm of the track projection .",
    "the shower width is calculated by taking the energy - weighted root - mean - square of the distance each crystal lies away from the center - of - gravity , which ought to be small for muons and non - interacting hadrons .",
    "the situation is complicated by the track curvature in the plane transverse to the beam direction , which makes the width depend on the transverse momentum . to separate this effect ,",
    "the width is calculated in the @xmath61@xmath62 plane only as fig .",
    "[ fig : shape_diagram ] shows , where the @xmath62-axis is aligned with the beam direction and @xmath61 points from the interaction point to energy cluster .",
    "the rms width is calculated along just the @xmath62-axis , and is multiplied by @xmath63 : @xmath64 the discrimination power of the shower energy and lateral size is evident in figs .",
    "[ fig : mupi_shape]a and [ fig : mupi_shape]b .",
    "these two - dimensional plots show the total matched energy @xmath51 along the ordinate and the shower width @xmath65 along the abscissa for particle momenta between 2 and 3  gev/@xmath31 .",
    "tracks are restricted to the barrel of the detector ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "muons selected from @xmath66 are shown in ( a ) , and charged pions from @xmath67 decays in two - prong annihilation produced tau events are shown in ( b ) .",
    "a two - dimensional cut is very effective at separating muons from interacting charged hadrons .",
    "the lines shown in fig .  [ fig : mupi_shape ] define the acceptance region as @xmath68  mev and @xmath69  cm .",
    "for momenta less than 3  gev/@xmath31 , only about 1 in 700 muons pass both cuts .",
    "figure  [ fig : pi_shape ] shows the efficiency for charged pions to lie in this acceptance region as a function of momentum ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "data from @xmath67 decays are shown by the solid circles , and the efficiency is consistent with that determined from pions in @xmath70 decays as well as pions in four - prong events .",
    "a monte carlo simulation based on the detector simulation package ( histogram ) shows good agreement with the data .",
    "the charged kaon showering efficiency is expected to be similar to that of charged pions based on a monte carlo simulation .",
    "the most efficient use of the shower selection criteria is to require just one track in a two - prong event to satisfy the shower shape cuts .",
    "this yields a 75% efficiency at large momenta , and a rejection factor for muon pair events of approximately @xmath71 .",
    "this allows a reach in @xmath5 of up to 5.1  gev/@xmath1 before the two - photon muon production cross section equals that predicted for charged pion and kaon pairs combined .",
    "an advantage of following this procedure is that it provides a self - checking method of examining the purity of the data sample .",
    "one can tag one charged meson as passing the shower shape cuts and then measure the shower shape efficiency of the other particle .",
    "this method would also be sensitive to any deviation of the charged kaon efficiency from that of charged pions .",
    "the empty circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : pi_shape ] represent this self - measured efficiency for two - prong events satisfying the two - photon event selection cuts summarized in table  [ tab : evtshape ] . the good agreement with the @xmath67 data for momenta less than 2  gev/@xmath31 suggests that there is little muon contamination in that region . for momenta above 2  gev/@xmath31 , however , the self - measured efficiency is significantly lower than expected .",
    "the inferred contamination is well described by known background sources of muons ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : bknd ] ) , and can easily be reduced to negligible levels using the muon chamber system since it is fully efficient at identifying muons ( and thus capable of suppressing them ) at these momenta .",
    "the tight geometric acceptance to avoid the cracks in the muon system is not necessary to accomplish this final level of filtering .",
    "therefore , to reject muons , we demand that at least one track satisfies the shower shape criteria , and that no muon chamber hits correlate to either track .",
    "the cross section measurement of a reaction similar to the two - photon production of charged pion and kaon pairs , but theoretically well understood , checks our understanding of the detector efficiencies as well as the modeling used at the generator level .",
    "such a process is the two - photon production of muon pairs ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "these events have a topology similar to @xmath73 , and the process can be calculated to high precision within qed .",
    "however , the two - photon event shape cuts described in sec .",
    "[ sec : selection ] select not only two - photon events , but also radiative annihilation events .",
    "in particular , the process @xmath66 can not be distinguished from @xmath72 when the radiated photon is at a small angle with respect to the beam axis  aside from the typically larger invariant mass of the two muons  since the @xmath59 center - of - mass will be lorentz boosted as in two - photon collisions .",

    "[ fig : pipi ] demonstrates that the sum of the two cross sections is nearly the same in both models .",
    "the measured cross section agrees well in shape with the qcd models over the entire measured range in @xmath22 , though the normalization of the models is approximately 40% below the data .",
    "there is no compelling reason to expect that the cross section should exhibit good agreement at low @xmath22 , however , since perturbation theory is not expected to be within kinematic range and resonance formation should contribute .",
    "the last point plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : pipi ] represents an upper limit at the 90% confidence level based on the observation of zero events ( with a background expectation of two ) in the @xmath22 range from 4 to 5  gev/@xmath1 . when the veto on events containing reconstructed @xmath55s is relaxed , two events",
    "do fall into this bin ; but they are consistent with the tau process @xmath97 , in agreement with the expected level of tau background .    the evolution of the @xmath46 distribution as a function of the invariant mass @xmath5 can be used to test the @xmath12 dependence of the qcd prediction .",
    "the mark  ii measurement@xcite did not have sufficient statistics to demonstrate such an angular distribution .",
    "we report a measurement of the differential pion and kaon pair cross section @xmath98 for four @xmath22 bins , each containing three @xmath99 bins .",
    "the result is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : sigma_cos]a  d .",
    "the angular bins are equally spaced in @xmath99 from 0.0 to 0.6 , and the @xmath22 ranges are : 1.52.0 , 2.02.5 , 2.53.0 , and 3.04.0  gev/@xmath1 . the leading order qcd prediction for @xmath98 , taken from the brodsky and lepage model@xcite ,",
    "is represented by the lines drawn in each figure .",
    "the measured cross section does exhibit a rise at small scattering angles consistent with that expected by leading order perturbative qcd in the highest two @xmath22 ranges .",
    "the behavior in the first range ( @xmath100  gev/@xmath1 ) is opposite what one expects based on qcd , while that in the second region ( @xmath101  gev/@xmath1 ) is flat in @xmath46 .",
    "the disparity of the measured low @xmath22 angular distribution with leading order qcd may be related to the non - perturbative nature of the cross section near the resonance region , and in particular , to the interference of the @xmath102 resonance with the @xmath9 continuum .",
    "indeed , the angular dependence reported here is similar to the angular dependence of the charged pion pair cross section in the region near the @xmath102 ( see for example j.  boyer _ et al._@xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the mark  ii experiment performed a similar combined measurement of the charged pion and kaon pair cross section at the pep @xmath21 storage ring@xcite .",
    "a direct comparison of our measured cross section with theirs is not straightforward , however , because of differing theoretical treatments in the extraction of the two - photon cross section .",
    "the primary differences involve the use of the equivalent photon approximation in the mark  ii analysis , and the application of a @xmath45 form factor to model the @xmath6 dependence of the virtual photons in our analysis .",
    "the combined effect of these two factors leads to an approximate 45% downward shift of the mark  ii two - photon cross section relative to ours .",
    "further differences include a smaller angular acceptance in the mark  ii measurement ( @xmath23 ) and a slightly different choice of @xmath103 . when both analyses are treated in a similar manner , the measured cross sections of cleo and mark  ii are compatible to within 10% .",
    "the tpc / two - gamma collaboration finds@xcite that the @xmath9 cross section is about three times larger than the leading order qcd prediction ( as given by the brodsky and lepage model ) in the @xmath5 range from 1.5 to 2.5  gev/@xmath1 , and in the smaller angular region @xmath25 . their kaon pair production cross section , though , is more in line with qcd in the measured @xmath5 range from 1.5 to 3.5  gev/@xmath1 , with @xmath24 .",
    "we find that in the narrow angular region @xmath25 , the tpc / two - gamma data lie approximately 30% below our data on the combined cross section for pion and kaon pairs in the @xmath22 range from 1.5 to 2.0  gev/@xmath1 . in this region",
    "our data also are several times larger than the leading order qcd prediction , see fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma_cos ] .",
    "systematic uncertainties on the measured cross section involve uncertainties in the trigger efficiency ( @xmath104 ) and the shower shape efficiency .",
    "the latter efficiency has been presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : pi_shape ] using various techniques , all in good agreement with the detector simulation .",
    "the stability of the measured cross section to the shower shape criteria has been studied by varying the cuts on the particle energy deposition in the calorimeter and the associated shower width by 25% of the nominal values .",
    "this range of values changes the overall event yield by as much as 50% for small @xmath22 , but leaves the extracted cross section unchanged to within 5% .",
    "moreover , the cross section has been measured with the shower shape criteria applied to both detected particles rather than just one .",
    "although the event yield is reduced approximately by two - thirds , the extracted cross section deviates by less than 10% .",
    "the shower shape criteria have also been applied to select charged pions in tau @xmath83vs@xmath19 events , where several of the event shape cuts have been modified to select events with missing momentum rather than suppress them .",
    "the muon is identified by its penetration to the muon chamber system as was done for the calibration study in sec .",
    "[ sec : calibration ] .",
    "the resulting cuts are loose enough to select additional tau channels  notably channels containing neutral energy ",
    "but when all tau channels are included into the monte carlo generator , the resulting event yield agrees with that from data to 5% .",
    "finally , the two - photon cross section has been measured using only the muon chamber system in the limited kinematic region of adequate muon pair suppression .",
    "results of this alternate approach confirm the functional dependence of our measurement of the cross section in both @xmath22 and @xmath99 , but disagree somewhat on absolute normalization .",
    "based on this study , and the previous tests of the shower shape efficiency , we assign a 20% systematic error to the overall normalization of our measurement , and a 10% systematic error on the point - to - point variation .",
    "in addition to the modeling uncertainties described above , the measured cross section has a slight systematic dependence on the particular choice for the ratio of the kaon pair cross section to the pion pair cross section in the monte carlo generator through eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmaextract ] ) .",
    "this ratio is taken to be 2.2 , but if it is reduced to unity as motivated by benayoun and chernyak@xcite , the reported cross section will also be reduced .",
    "the reduction is largest at small @xmath22 , where the cross section is reduced by 12% for @xmath105  gev/@xmath1 . for @xmath22 in the range from 1.8 to 2.75  gev/@xmath1 ,",
    "the reduction is approximately 8% ; and for @xmath22 larger than 2.75  gev/@xmath1 , the reduction is 3% or less . finally , as noted before ,",
    "removing the @xmath45 form factors in the modeling of the @xmath6 dependence of the virtual photons reduces our measured cross section by approximately 30% .",
    "we have presented data on the combined two - photon production of charged pion and kaon pairs from a sample of 1.2  @xmath0 collected at cesr .",
    "the @xmath22 dependence of the measured cross section in the angular region @xmath24 shows reasonable agreement with leading order perturbative qcd predictions across the entire measured range from 1.5 to 5.0  gev/@xmath1 , though the qcd based models lie approximately 40% below the data .",
    "the @xmath46 dependence of the cross section exhibits a rise at small scattering angles consistent with that expected by qcd for @xmath106  gev/@xmath1 .",
    "the magnitude of the measured cross section is in good agreement with results from the mark  ii experiment , but is in disagreement by about 30% with results from the tpc / two - gamma experiment .",
    "systematic uncertainties on the extracted cross section from detector acceptance effects amount to 20% , while different theoretical treatments in the extraction of the cross section lead to variations of up to 30% .",
    "the reported measurement extends the reach in @xmath5 further than previous experiments , allowing the observation of a transition in the cross section from non - perturbative to perturbative behavior .",
    "sufficient rejection of leptonic events is achieved through the novel use of the electromagnetic calorimeter as a tag on early interacting hadrons , which removes some of the fiducial and momentum constraints of the conventional muon chamber system .",
