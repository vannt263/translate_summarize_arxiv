    "a big theoretical and observational effort has been done in recent years for the understanding of the disk occurrence and evolution in herbig ae / be stars .",
    "evidence of the existence of dusty and gaseous circumstellar disks around some hbe stars exists at optical , near and mid ir ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and more recently @xcite ) . it is generally accepted the presence of disks similar to those in t tauri stars for herbig ae and late ( spectral type later than b7 ) be stars , usually flared disks with inner rims , but the association of more massive early be stars with disks is more uncertain , and the direct detection of a circumstellar disk around an hbe star at millimeter wavelengths has remained elusive until recently . the direct detection of a gaseous disk around r mon also allows us to study the geometry and kinematics of a circumstellar disk in a b0 star .",
    "r mon is a very young b0 star with a t tauri companion separated by 0.69 `` . because of its youth , r mon is not directly visible in the optical , but appears as a resolved conical reflection nebula in scattered light . at infrared wavelengths ,",
    "r mon appears as a point source located 0.06''@xmath140.02 south from the optical peak ( @xcite ) . based on hi emission - line ratios",
    ", @xcite measured an extinction of av = 13.1 mag towards the star that they interpreted as due to an optically thick disk of r = 100 au .",
    "@xcite detected a dusty disk around r mon .",
    "new continuum observations ( @xcite , hereafter paper i ) carried out with the a configuration of the pdbi allowed us to constrain the size , mass , and spectral index of this circumstellar disk .",
    "our results showed that the size of the dusty disk is 0.3 \" , or 150 au of radius , in agreement with the value derived by @xcite .",
    "fitting the sed in the mm range ( see @xcite for details ) we obtained our best fit with a dusty disk of mass m@xmath15 and a spectral index @xmath16 = 0.3 .",
    "the low value of @xmath16 suggested us that grain growth has proceeded to large sizes in the disk around r mon .",
    "typical values of 0.5 - 1 are found in herbig ae and t tauri stars , also associated with grain growth .",
    "interferometric observations of @xmath2co 1@xmath10 and 2@xmath11 transitions were also presented in paper i. we discussed our data by means of the results of a radiative transfer model applied to the observed molecular emission .",
    "we found that the observations were well fitted using a flat gaseous disk in keplerian rotation , with an apparent inclination of 20 degrees from edge - on view , and a mass of 0.014 @xmath17 .",
    "we were also able to constrain the mass of r mon to 8@xmath141 @xmath17 .",
    "we found some keys to support a flat disk instead of a flared disk geometry .",
    "however , since the co emission from this circumstellar disk is optically thick , we were not able to discard a flared geometry for the disk .",
    "@xmath0co 1@xmath10 observations were carried out with the iram array at plateau de bure between january 2006 and march 2006 , using ab configuration ( beam 1.1``x0.7 '' at 110.2 ghz ) .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio ( 5@xmath18 detection ) is not good enough to study the spatial distribution of this molecule , but allows us to conclude about the geometry of the disk around r mon .",

    "the emission presents a bipolar morphology with a blue parabolic lobe towards the north and the red one towards the south .",
    "this n - s distribution is consistent with the morphology of the bipolar outflow at larger scales .",
    "the red lobe shows a jet - like morphology , i.e. , we have detected a molecular jet associated with this b0 star .",
    "the strip - disk line shows the expected orientation of the disk.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "the interferometric co images ( figure  [ fig:1]c and  [ fig:1]d ) show a compact molecular clump towards the star position with a size of 2.5 \" ( 2000 au at d = 800 pc ) in the @xmath2co 2@xmath11 line and a more extended and weaker component which follows the shape of the nebula . in figure  [ fig:2 ] the blueshifted and redshifted components are drawn separately .",

    "we have modeled the @xmath2co 2@xmath11 and 1@xmath10 emissions using a flat disk model .",

    "the density profile obtained with the model is consistent with the mass derived from the continuum data within a factor 2 .",
    "a turbulent width component in the velocity profile is set to 0.8 km / s and added to the thermal width ( table  [ tab:1 ] ) .    in figure  [ fig:4 ]",
    "the individual fit to some of the spectra ( corresponding to certain position offset in au along the major axis of the disk ) for @xmath2co 2@xmath11 is shown .",
    "a very good fit is obtained all over the disk , even in other directions outside the major axis .",
    "this is the strongest evidence of a disk in keplerian rotation obtained so far around an early be star .",
    "since the @xmath2co lines are optically thick , only the surface of the disk is contributing to the emission , so the mass of the gaseous disk can not be derived from these observations . as a consequence ,",
    "the assumed geometry for the disk determines its mass .",
    "in fact , we reasonably fit the @xmath2co emission using both a flat and a flared disk model , but with a mass 8 times larger in the second case . we need to observe the rarer isotope @xmath0co to determine the opacity of the co lines and derive the mass and density structure of the disk , and eventually the disk geometry ( see discussion in paper i ) . in figure  [ fig:5 ]",
    "we present the model results for @xmath0co , showing that the flat disk model also fits this emission using the same parameters and an abundance of 9@xmath310@xmath5 @xmath25 ( 90 times below @xmath2co standard abundance , as expected ) .",
    "the flared disk model predicts an emission that exceeds the observed one by a factor @xmath262 . as a result of these new observations and modellings ,",
    "now we can confirm that the disk is flat .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath0co/@xmath2co line intensity ratio reveals as a power diagnostic tool to discern between flared and flat disks .",

    ", a comparison between the observed ( grey ) and the modeled ( dark ) spectra is shown for the star position .",
    "note that the emission at the velocities of the molecular cloud ( 9.5 @xmath14 2.5 km / s ) has been filtered out by the interferometric observations.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]        co disk emission detected towards r mon is well fitted by the flat disk model .",
    "the flared disk model ( with a mass of 0.08 m@xmath13 ) predicts an emission clearly above the observed values.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]",
    "based on ir observations several authors have proposed that , contrary to hae and tt stars , hbe stars seem to have geometrically flat disks ( @xcite ) . our result in r",
    "mon confirms this point .",
    "moreover , the slope parameters for density and temperature distributions along the r mon disk are similar to those found on tts and some hae ( @xcite ) , and , as most of them , is also in keplerian rotation .",
    "the main difference respect to tts and hae stars is the mass of the disk , which is an order of magnitude lower in r mon and in other hbe stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "the similarities could indicate a common mechanism for star formation in the range @xmath27 @xmath17 . on the other hand",
    ", the different mass of the disks clearly indicates a shorter timescale for the evolution of disks around hbe stars , where the material is quickly dispersed .",
    "in fact , the low occurrence of disks found around hbe stars ( @xcite ) supports this conclusion .",
    "a rapid evolution is also supported by the value of the spectral index @xmath16 .",
    "this indicates the presence of large dust grains , which drops the optical depth , so the uv radiation penetrates to photoevaporate the external layers ( @xcite ) .",
    "such disks could evolve to flat geometries in 10@xmath28 years ."
