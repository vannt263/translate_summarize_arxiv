    "we ask here then what part of the susy parameter space can be tested for the range @xmath8 we do this by examining the maximum theoretical cross section that lies in this domain by varying the susy parameters ( e.g. tan@xmath9 , @xmath10 , etc ) . in the following ,",
    "we consider three supergravity models : msugra with universal soft breaking parameters @xcite , sugra models with non - universal soft breaking in both the higgs @xcite and third generation squark / slepton sector @xcite , and a d - brane model which allows for a specific pattern of nonuniversal gaugino , squark and slepton masses @xcite .",

    "the theoretical analysis determines the @xmath30 scattering cross section , and in order to relate this to the proton cross section two parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 enter @xcite , where @xmath33 as well as the quark mass ratio @xmath34 .",
    "we use here @xmath35 , in accord with recent analysis@xcite and @xmath36 @xcite .",

    "theory allows one to calculate the mean @xmath38 relic cold matter ( cdm ) of the universe , parametrized by @xmath39 , where @xmath40 ( @xmath41= mass density of @xmath38 , @xmath42 , @xmath43= hubble constant ) and h=@xmath44 ) .",

    "eq.(6 ) puts a strong constraint on the susy parameter space and this then affects the @xmath61 cross section . from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] one sees that ( i ) @xmath58 decreases with increasing m@xmath62 and @xmath10 ( thus increasing @xmath63 ) and ( ii ) if @xmath64 is near ( but below ) @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 rapid annihialtion occurs through s -channel pole ( thus decreasing @xmath63 ) .",
    "while lep has now eliminated most of the parameter space where @xmath68 , both @xmath69 and @xmath70 become light for large tan@xmath9 making this effect latter significant in that domain .",
    "in general one sees that the bounds of eq .",
    "( 6 ) exert a strong inflence on the allowed susy parameter space , and this in turn affects the size of the @xmath71 cross section . from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] one has that ( i)@xmath6 becomes large for light ( first generation ) squarks ( i.e. small @xmath12 ) and light higgs bosons , which is just the region of rapid early universe annihilation .",
    "thus the lower bound on @xmath63 can produce an upper bound on @xmath6 .",
    "( ii ) we also note that @xmath6 increases with tan@xmath9 .",
    "the msugra model with radiative breaking of @xmath72 depends upon four parameters and one sign .",
    "these may be taken as following : m@xmath62 , the universal scalar mass at m@xmath73 ; m@xmath74 , the universal gaugino mass at m@xmath73 ( or alternately one may use @xmath10 or m@xmath75 at the electroweak scale since these scale with m@xmath74 i.e. @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) ; a@xmath62 , the universal soft breaking mass at m@xmath73 ; tan@xmath14 ; and the sign of @xmath78 , the higgs mixing parameter in the superpotential ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "( with our choice of sign in @xmath80 , the @xmath20 constraint eliminates most of the @xmath81 parameter space . )",
    "we proceed by varying the above parameters over the allowed space subject to all the constraints discussed above .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath6 as a function of @xmath10 is given in fig .",
    "we see that current experiments sensitive to @xmath82 pb are probing only large tan@xmath9 regime for this model , i.e. tan@xmath1 .",
    "to obtain further insight as to the parameter space being probed by current experiments , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the value of @xmath63 when @xmath6 takes on its maximum value for the characteristic case of tan@xmath9=30 .",
    "we see that @xmath63 increases as @xmath10 increases ( as expected from the general discussion above ) from roughly the minimum to maximum value allowed by eq.(6 ) .",
    "thus an accurate determination of @xmath83 as might be expected from the map sattelite , would significantly help narrow the allowed susy parameter space .",
    "one notes in fig .",
    "3 that the larger tan@xmath9 cross section sustain with increasing @xmath10 more than the smaller tan@xmath9 do .",
    "this is due to the fact noted above that m@xmath84 and m@xmath85 become lighter as tan@xmath9 increases increasing @xmath6 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] for the two cases of tan@xmath9=30 and tan@xmath9=50 .",
    "in contrast , m@xmath86 is relatively heavy , i.e. for tan@xmath9=30 one has that m@xmath86 increases monotonically with @xmath10 from 112 gev to 128 gev . since m@xmath62 is not large when @xmath6 is at maximum , the squarks lie below and close to the gluino where @xmath87",
    "the possibility of nonuniversal soft breaking significantly changes the region of parameter space being accessed by current dark matter experiments .",
    "we consider here the case where nonuniversal soft breaking masses are allowed both in the higgs and third generation sectors .",
    "a general parametrization at @xmath22 then @xmath88 here @xmath89 is the universal mass of the first two generations , and @xmath90 are the deviations for the higgs and third generation .",
    "we assume here that @xmath91 .",
    "( note that for @xmath92 one would have @xmath93 and @xmath94 . )    in order to understand the effects that occur in this more complicated situation we first note thate @xmath95 is a mixture of gaugino and higgsino part : @xmath96 .",
    "further , the spin independent cross section arises due to the interference between the gaugino and higgsino parts of @xmath95 , causing @xmath6 to increase with increasing interference .",
    "the susy parameter that to a large extent controls the amount of interference is @xmath97 , interference increasing ( and hence @xmath6 increasing ) as @xmath97 decreases , and interference decreases as @xmath97 increases .",
    "the value of @xmath97 at the electroweak scale in terms of the gut scale parameter is determined by the rges . in general",
    ", one must solve these numerically .",
    "however , one can get a qualitative understanding of the effects of the @xmath90 from an analytic solution which is valid for low and intermediate tan@xmath9@xcite : @xmath98m_0 ^ 2\\\\\\nonumber & + & { \\rm { universal \\ , parts + loop \\ , corrections}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath99 , and @xmath100",
    ". in general @xmath101 is small i.e @xmath102 .",
    "( 9 ) shows that it is necessary to consider both the squark nonuniversalities ( @xmath103 and @xmath104 ) as well as the higgs ( @xmath105 and @xmath106 ) since they produce effects of comparable size .",
    "one sees from eq .",
    "( 9 ) that @xmath97 will be significantly reduced ( and hence @xmath6 increased ) if one chooses @xmath107 and @xmath1080 .",
    "( the reverse will be the case for the opposite choice of signs . )",
    "this effect can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , where the maximum value of @xmath109 is plotted for tan@xmath110 for the nonuniversal model ( upper curve ) and msugra ( lower curve ) .",
    "one sees that with the choice @xmath107 and @xmath1080 one can increase the cross section by a factor of 10 to 100 . as a consequence ,",
    "there are regions of parameter space where the nonuniversal models can be probed to much lower tan@xmath9 .",
    "this is exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . where the maximum cross section is given for tan@xmath9=7 and tan@xmath9=5 .",
    "one sees that current experiments are probing tan@xmath9 as low as tan@xmath1114 .",
    "since these experiments have also excluded the region @xmath112 pb , one finds that part of the parameter space for tan@xmath113 is already experimentally excluded for these models . of course , the reverse choice of signs for @xmath90 will lower the cross section for any value of tan@xmath9 , leaving such parts of the parameter space mostly as yet unexplored experimentally .",
    "when @xmath114 takes on its maximum value for this model , the light higgs becomes quite light lying just above the lep 200 limit .",
    "thus for tan@xmath9=7 one finds 100 gev@xmath115 107 gev which would make the h relatively easy to find at the lhc and the tevatron run ii .",
    "in contrast the squark can become quite heavy .",
    "this can be seen from eq .",
    "( 9 ) where the negative nonuniversal term dominates the @xmath116 contribution , and hence making @xmath116 large reduces @xmath97 , making @xmath114 larger .",
    "thus the first two generation squarks for this situation have masses in the range 600 gev@xmath117 1200 gev , and lie above the gluino .",
    "large values of @xmath29 tend to suppress proton decay amplitudes of gut models and would help relieve the tension between a large @xmath118 and a small p decay rate .",
    "recent advances in string theory based on dp - branes ( manifolds of p+1 dimensions ) has led to a revival of phenomenologically motivated string models .",
    "one class of such models making use of type iib orientifolds@xcite allows one to put the standard model gauge group on 5-branes , manifolds of six dimensions , of which four are usual minkowski space and two are compactified on a torus .",
    "an interesting model of this class puts @xmath119 on one set of 5 branes , 5@xmath120 and @xmath121 on a second intersecting set 5@xmath122@xcite .",
    "strings starting on @xmath123 and ending on @xmath124 have massless modes carrying the joint quantum numbers of the two branes ( presumably the sm quark and lepton doublets and the higgs doublets ) , while strings begining and ending on 5@xmath120 have modes carrying @xmath125 quantum numbers ( the right handed quark and lepton states ) .",
    "this leads to a model with a unique set of nonuniversal gaugino and squark and slepton masses at @xmath22 parametrized as follows : @xmath126 and @xmath127 here @xmath128 , i=1,2,3 are three gaugino masses at @xmath22 , while @xmath129 are @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 sfermion and higgs ( mass)@xmath134 and @xmath135 are @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 sfermion ( mass)@xmath134 .",
    "in addition , one has the b soft breaking mass and the @xmath78 parameter at the gut scale @xmath139 where @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 are possible cp violating phases . as can be seen from eqs.(9,10 ) ,",
    "the parameters @xmath143 and @xmath144 are restricted to @xmath145 ( @xmath146 ) and @xmath147 .",
    "models of this type are of interest in that they are natural possibilities in string theory , and yet it would be difficult to see how such a symmetry breaking pattern could arise in conventional sugra gut models .",
    "one aspect of the model is that the cancelations between the gluino and neutralino cp violating phases in the electron and neutron electric dipole moments ( edms ) implied by eq .",
    "( 10 ) allows the cp violating phases to be larger than usual at the elctroweak scale and still satisfy the experimental edm bounds @xcite .",
    "however , these experimental bounds combined with the requirement of radiative breaking of @xmath148 at the elctroweak scale , leads to serious fine tuning of parameters at the gut scale unless tan@xmath149@xcite .",
    "since we will be interested here in large tan@xmath9 ( to investigate the maximum values of @xmath109 ) in the following we will first set all the cp violating phases to zero .",
    "one then has a model with four parameters and one sign i.e. @xmath150 , @xmath143 , @xmath151 and tan@xmath9 , and the sign of @xmath78 .",
    "( as before , @xmath78 must be negative for most of the parameter space to satisfy the @xmath20 constraint . )",
    "[ fig8 ] shows @xmath6 as a function of @xmath152 , which is parametrized by @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath150 .",
    "one has that @xmath6 increases with increasing @xmath143 since by eq .",
    "( 10 ) the squark masses of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] decrease .",
    "[ fig9 ] shows @xmath6 for tan@xmath9=15 and @xmath150=200 gev .",
    "one sees that one needs a large tan@xmath9 , i.e. @xmath153 to obtain a cross section within current experimental sensitivities , i.e. @xmath154 pb .    we next allow the cp violating phases to be non - zero to investigate their effect on @xmath114 cross section .",
    "we impose here the experimental constraint on the electron edm of @xmath155 ecm at 95@xmath156 c.l .",
    "( we do not impose the neutron edm constraint here as there are a number of ambiguities in calculating @xmath157 @xcite ) .",
    "[ fig10 ] shows that @xmath114 decreases with increasing phase 2@xmath158 , the presence of the phase decreasing @xmath109 , by a factor of two more .",
    "as mentioned above , such large phases , while still satisfying the experimental bound on @xmath159 , require a serious fine tuning of other parametrs .",
    "[ fig11 ] shows the allowed range @xmath160 of the phase @xmath161 to satisfy the electron edm for tan@xmath9=15 , @xmath162 .",
    "one sees that @xmath163 must be chosen very precisely to satisfy the edm constraint on @xmath159 .",
    "if one were also to impose the neutron edm constraint as well , the fine tuning would be even more severe @xcite .",
    "we have considered here the question of what part of the susy parameter space can be probed by detectors sensitive to the neutralino proton cross section in the range of eq .",
    "( 1 ) . in order to examine this",
    "we have considered the maximum theoretical cross section as function of @xmath152 .",
    "the answer depends on the particular susy model one is considering . thus for msugra models , one requires tan@xmath164 25 to achieve current detector sensitivities @xmath165 pb . in this case",
    ", a large @xmath114 corresponds to relatively heavy higgs , @xmath166 gev , a light neutralino of @xmath167 gev ( from the relic density constraint ) and moderate squark masses ( e.g. @xmath168 gev lying below but close to the gluino mass .",
    "nonuniversal sugra models can increase or decrease @xmath114 by a factor of 10 to 100 . in the former case",
    ", one can begin to probe the parameter space for tan@xmath164 4 for @xmath169 pb . here the higgs is relatively light , @xmath170 gev , while the squarks are heavy ( e.g. @xmath171 gev ) and lie well above the gluino .",
    "current data has in fact begun to eliminate part of the parameter space for tan@xmath164 15 .    in the d - brane model",
    "considered , one requires tan@xmath164 15 for @xmath165 pb . cp violating phases that can appear in such models lower the @xmath61 cross section by a factor of two or more .",
    "however , there is a serious fine tuning problem for the @xmath78 phase at @xmath22 for such large values of @xmath172 .    the fact that in the nonuniversal sugra models one can get a large @xmath114 with a small tan@xmath9 and large squark mass tends to relieve some of the tension between dark matter cross sections and proton decay .",
    "thus if @xmath173 dark matter were discovered with @xmath174 pb , such models could still have a low proton decay rate since @xmath175 is suppressed for small @xmath172 and large @xmath29 .    in our analysis here",
    ", we have neglected the possibility of coannihilation effects since the rapid early universe annihilation produced by such effects generally require raising @xmath12 and @xmath176 to avoid violating the lower bound of eq .",
    "( 6 ) , lowering the @xmath177 cross section .",
    "( we have been intersted here in the maximum values of @xmath114 . )",
    "we note , however , that aside from the coannihilation region arising from the @xmath178 degeneracy for msugra at low and intermediate tan@xmath9 discussed in @xcite , there are three other coannihilation regions for the models considered here . in msugra with large tan@xmath9 , the chargino @xmath23 can become degenerate with the @xmath173 leading to a new coannihilation domain . in the nonuniversal sugra model",
    ", one can see from eq .",
    "( 8) that the choice @xmath179 can make the @xmath180 light and hence become degenerate with the @xmath173 even for small tan@xmath9 . for the d - brane models one sees from eq .",
    "( 9 ) that as @xmath144 gets large , @xmath181 and @xmath182 become equal allowing the @xmath183 to become degenerate with @xmath173 ( roughly for @xmath184 ) . unlike the case considered in @xcite ,",
    "each of these new domains can occur for light neutralinos where @xmath185 may be large .",
