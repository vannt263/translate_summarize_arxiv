    "efficient estimation techniques are often preferred because they maximally exploit available information and minimize the uncertainty of the resulting scientific findings .",
    "efficiency is most broadly defined in an asymptotic sense . as such , characterizing asymptotic efficiency and constructing asymptotically efficient estimators has been an important focus of methodological and theoretical research in statistics . for convenience , throughout this paper , we ascribe an asymptotic sense to the terms _ efficient _ and _ efficiency_.    in the context of parametric models , a simple efficiency theory has been available for nearly a century , largely established in fisher s work on maximum likelihood estimation . in such models , efficiency is characterized by the cramer - rao bounds and efficient estimators can generally be obtained via maximum likelihood ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . when parametric models are adopted in practice ,",
    "it is often because they are simple and convenient to use .",
    "however , the use of such models carries the potential for model misspecification , which may have potentially serious adverse effects on the scientific process . in many scientific problems ,",
    "the available background knowledge simply does not justify the use of such restrictive statistical models .",
    "infinite - dimensional models  either nonparametric or semiparametric  offer a more flexible alternative .",
    "these richer models mitigate the risk of model misspecification and more accurately reflect the level of available prior knowledge .",
    "unfortunately , establishing efficiency bounds for target parameters in infinite - dimensional models can be a very complex task .",
    "the development of a general efficiency theory , valid for arbitrary statistical models , is a more recent accomplishment : except for the early seminal contribution of @xcite , developments in this area began in the late 1970s and early 1980s with the works of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , among others , and continued throughout the 1990s ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "notably , it builds upon notions of differential geometry and functional analysis . in certain cases , a generalized notion of maximum likelihood , as described , for example , by @xcite , can still be used to produce efficient estimators . in other cases",
    "though , the statistical model is too complex for a maximum likelihood estimator to exist , let alone be well - behaved .",
    "this renders the pursuit of efficient estimators a substantially more difficult task in infinite - dimensional models .",
    "a key object in this general efficiency theory is the efficient influence function , hereafter referred to as eif .",
    "it bears this name because it is the influence function of any efficient estimator of the parameter of interest given a particular statistical model .",
    "if the eif is known , efficiency bounds can easily be estimated , at least theoretically , and the performance of candidate estimators can be examined against an objective benchmark .",
    "valid confidence intervals based on a given efficient estimator can also be constructed using the eif .",
    "this is particularly useful in settings where the bootstrap is known to fail .",
    "more importantly , if the analytic form of the eif is available , efficient estimators can be constructed rather easily .",
    "to do so , several approaches may be used , including , for example , gradient - based estimating equations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , newton - raphson one - step corrections ( e.g. , @xcite ) and targeted minimum loss - based estimation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this provides a strong motivation for deriving the eif in a given statistical problem .",
    "unfortunately , the analytic computation of the eif is seldom straightforward .",
    "it generally involves finding an influence function , characterizing the tangent space of the statistical model and projecting onto it  the effort can be mathematically intricate .",
    "over the years , many techniques have been developed to facilitate this task in certain classes of problems  the discretization technique of @xcite is one such example . despite this , this calculation remains a rather specialized skill , mastered mostly by a small collection of theoretically - inclined researchers .",
    "the theoretical derivation of eifs is generally not in the skill set of practicing statisticians . yet , in many problems , it is a necessary skill to master in order to make optimal inference in more realistic statistical models .",
    "the paucity of this skill has likely constituted an impediment to a broader appreciation and adoption of semiparametric and nonparametric techniques in applications .    in view of this barrier , one naturally wonders whether a suitable numerical approximation could serve as substitute for the analytic form of the eif , and further whether its calculation could be computerized .",
    "an affirmative answer to this question would render the implementation of efficient inferential techniques in semiparametric and nonparametric models much more accessible to practitioners , and the impact on current statistical practice could be profound .",
    "recently , a very important first step toward this goal was made by @xcite : these authors proposed a simple numerical routine for calculating the eif in the context of nonparametric models when the data are discrete - valued or when the parameter is a smooth functional of the distribution function . in our discussion of their article ( see @xcite ) , we suggested a regularization of their technique that is valid more broadly within the context of nonparametric models .",
    "nevertheless , neither of these methods formally address the more difficult problem of computerizing the calculation of the eif in semiparametric models .",
    "as opposed to nonparametric models , for which the tangent space is trivially described , semiparametric models generally have much more complex tangent spaces , projecting onto which may often require great skill .",
    "identifying a numerical approach for computing the eif in semiparametric models is therefore a more difficult but also more needed innovation . in this article , we establish and study novel representations of the eif that naturally allows a numerical computation of the eif of a given parameter in a given statistical model .",
    "importantly , we do not impose constraints on the type of model that may be considered .",
    "these representations hold great promise in allowing true computerization , as we discuss below .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we present novel representations of the eif for use in arbitrary statistical models and show how they may be used to calculate the eif numerically . in section 3 , we establish sufficient technical conditions that guarantee the validity of these representations .",
    "we discuss various practical issues regarding the implementation of our proposal in section 4 . in section 5",
    ", we illustrate the validity and feasibility of the approach in the context of two examples .",
    "finally , we provide concluding remarks in section 6 .",
    "while theorem 1 is proved in the body of the paper , the proof of theorems 2 , 3 and 4 are provided in an appendix .",
    "suppose that we observe independent @xmath0-dimensional variates @xmath1 following a distribution @xmath2 known only to belong to the statistical model @xmath3 .",
    "we denote by @xmath4 the sample space associated to @xmath5 .",
    "we are interested in efficiently inferring about @xmath6 using the available data , where @xmath7 represents a pathwise differentiable parameter mapping of interest .",
    "pathwise differentiability ensures the parameter is a sufficiently smooth mapping so as to admit an efficiency theory ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath8 the hilbert space of @xmath9-integrable functions from @xmath10 to @xmath11 with mean zero and finite variance under @xmath9 . the parameter @xmath12 is said to be pathwise differentiable if there exists some @xmath13 such that , for each regular one - dimensional parametric submodel @xmath14 with @xmath15 an interval containing zero and @xmath16 , the pathwise derivative @xmath17 can be represented as the inner product @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the score for @xmath20 at @xmath21 in @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "any such element @xmath23 is said to be a gradient of @xmath12 at @xmath9 relative to @xmath3 .",
    "the tangent space @xmath24 of @xmath3 at @xmath9 is defined as the closure of the linear span of scores at @xmath9 arising from regular one - dimensional parametric submodels of @xmath3 through @xmath9 .",
    "the canonical gradient is the unique gradient contained in @xmath24 and corresponds to the eif under sampling from @xmath9 . throughout",
    ", we will refer to the eif at @xmath9 as @xmath25 and write @xmath26 for the evaluation of @xmath25 at the observation value @xmath27 .",
    "the asymptotic variance of an efficient estimator of @xmath28 relative to model @xmath3 is given by @xmath29 .",
    "without loss of generality , we will assume @xmath30 since the general case can be trivially dealt with using the developments herein applied to each component .",
    "if pathwise differentiability holds uniformly over paths in a neighborhood around @xmath9 , for any @xmath31 close enough to @xmath9 , the parameter admits the linearization @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a second - order remainder term , and the second line follows from the first since @xmath34 in view of the fact that the eif is centered .",
    "this representation , which is no more than a first - order taylor approximation over the model space , holds for most smooth parameters arising in practice .",
    "the precise form of @xmath35 is generally established by hand on a case - by - case basis .",
    "this linearization is critical for motivating and studying the use of both newton - raphson one - step correction and targeted minimum loss - based estimation to construct efficient estimators .",
    "it is also at the heart of our current proposal for obtaining a numerical approximation to the eif value @xmath36 at a given distribution @xmath5 and observation value @xmath37 .",
    "recently , @xcite presented one such proposal based on the representation of @xmath36 as the gteaux derivative of @xmath12 at @xmath9 in the direction of @xmath38 , where @xmath39 represents the degenerate distribution at @xmath27 .",
    "of course , this can also be seen as the pathwise derivative @xmath40 of @xmath12 at @xmath9 along the linear perturbation path @xmath41 between @xmath9 and @xmath42  this simple observation will be helpful when dealing with arbitrary models . here and throughout , any such derivative is of course interpreted as a right derivative . to computerize the process of calculating @xmath26",
    ", these authors suggested approximating this derivative by the slope of the secant line connecting @xmath43 and @xmath44 for a very small @xmath45 . in our discussion of @xcite ( see @xcite ) , we pointed out sufficient conditions that guarantee that this indeed approximates @xmath26 .",
    "for example , this approach is valid whenever the model @xmath3 is nonparametric and the sample space @xmath10 is finite .",
    "however , if the parameter @xmath12 depends on local features of the distribution , this method may fail when @xmath10 is infinite , such as when any component of @xmath46 is continuous under @xmath9 .",
    "we proposed a slight modification of the procedure of @xcite to remedy this limitation .",
    "specifically , we proposed replacing the degenerate distribution @xmath42 at @xmath27 by a distribution @xmath47 symmetric about @xmath27 , dominated by @xmath9 and such that @xmath48 as @xmath49 for all @xmath50 in a sufficiently large class of functions",
    ". this amounts to replacing the degenerate distribution by a nearly degenerate distribution with smoothing parameter @xmath51 . in a technical report published contemporaneously",
    ", @xcite also suggested this approach .",
    "as stated in @xcite , under certain regularity conditions and provided @xmath3 is nonparametric , it is generally the case that @xmath52 where we have defined the linear perturbation path @xmath53 .",
    "representation is useful when the parameter is simple enough so that calculating the derivative of @xmath54 is analytically convenient .",
    "otherwise , representation can be used to circumvent this analytic step by approximating this derivative by the slope of a secant line , as in @xcite .",
    "because these representations constitute a special case of the general result described in the next subsection , we defer a statement of regularity conditions and a formal proof until then .    in practice , to approximate @xmath26 numerically , the secant line slope exhibited in is evaluated for small @xmath20 and @xmath55 . this operation only requires the ability to evaluate @xmath12 on a given distribution . generally ,",
    "as we highlighted in @xcite , @xmath20 must be chosen much smaller than @xmath55 to obtain an accurate approximation ",
    "this emphasizes that the order of the limits in plays an important role in the implementation of this procedure .",
    "we discuss this point in greater detail later .",
    "when the model is not nonparametric , the representations provided in and generally do not hold . except for",
    "when @xmath21 , the linear perturbation path described by @xmath56 is usually not contained in the model .",
    "therefore , the parameter may not even be defined on this path .",
    "even if it is , in general , the approximation suggested by these representations will at best yield the eif of @xmath12 relative to a nonparametric model rather than the actual model . while the eif in a nonparametric model is still an influence function in @xmath3 ,",
    "it is not typically efficient .",
    "this is also clear from a practical perspective : since the expressions in and @xmath57 do not acknowledge constraints implied by @xmath3 , they could not possibly yield the actual eif .",
    "since the path @xmath58 is generally not in @xmath3 for @xmath59 , it appears natural to consider the behavior of @xmath12 along the analogue of the linear perturbation path in @xmath3 .",
    "to formalize this idea , we may consider the path @xmath60 obtained by projecting @xmath56 according to the kullback - leibler divergence into @xmath3 or a suitably regularized version thereof .",
    "we formally define @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the subset of all probability measures in @xmath3 that are absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath9 , @xmath63 is a measure dominating @xmath9 , and for any @xmath64 , @xmath65 is the density of @xmath66 relative to @xmath63 .",
    "this projection defines a novel path in the model space . under regularity conditions",
    ", we can then establish that and hold more broadly when the linear perturbation path is replaced by the model - specific path defined by this projection , as is formalized below . here and throughout",

    ".    condition ( a1 ) drives in large part our generalization of the procedures of @xcite and @xcite to arbitratry models .",
    "projecting the path @xmath78 into @xmath3 to obtain @xmath79 is expected to ensure that the score - like equation described in ( a1 ) is solved .",
    "in fact , as we will see in the next section , mild regularity conditions ensure that ( a1 ) is satisfied .",
    "condition ( a2 ) imposes relatively weak continuity requirements on the eif .",
    "since @xmath35 is a second - order term , @xmath80 is generally of order @xmath81 for each fixed @xmath51 .",
    "condition ( a3 ) requires that @xmath82 be of order @xmath83 for @xmath55 small and @xmath20 sufficiently smaller .",
    "determining how the projection step and the smoothing parameter @xmath51 affects the rate of this second - order remainder term is critical to establishing whether ( a3 ) holds .",
    "this is studied in detail in the next section .",
    "if the projection @xmath60 is available in closed form , suggests that we can calculate @xmath26 by analytically computing the pathwise derivative of @xmath84 at @xmath21 and evaluating it at some small value of @xmath51 .",
    "if @xmath60 is not available in closed form or the mapping @xmath84 is difficult to differentiate analytically , suggests using the secant line slope @xmath85 for small @xmath55 and even smaller @xmath20 as an approximation to @xmath26 .",
    "strategies for appropriately selecting values of @xmath20 and @xmath55 are discussed in section [ practice ] , whereas the sensitivity of the approximation to these choices will be studied in the context of two examples in section [ illustrations ] .",
    "much of the effort required to use representations and goes into identifying the projection @xmath60 of @xmath56 onto the model space . for this task ,",
    "the equivalence between minimization of the kullback - leibler divergence and maximization of the likelihood is often useful and can be leveraged . in many cases",
    ", this projection can be identified analytically . in many others",
    ", a numerical approach must be taken .",
    "regardless , the definition of @xmath60 does not involve the parameter of interest .",
    "hence , the more challenging portion of the approach is exclusively model - specific , and once it has been successfully tackled , the resulting projection can be used for any parameter a practitioner may wish to study .",
    "this contrasts sharply with the conventional approach to deriving the eif , wherein the statistician must first derive an influence function , characterize the tangent space of the model , and finally project the influence function onto this tangent space . in this conventional approach , both the parameter - specific task  finding an influence function  and the model - specific task  studying the tangent space and how to project onto it  require specialized knowledge . performing these tasks for a given parameter and model combination does not automatically provide an easy way of tackling any other parameter , in contrast to the approach that we propose .",
    "the validity of representations and is guaranteed to hold under the high - level technical conditions ( a1 ) , ( a2 ) and ( a3 ) .",
    "we now identify lower - level sufficient conditions under which ( a1 ) , ( a2 ) and ( a3 ) , and thus also theorem [ representation ] , hold .    in the developments below ,",
    "we let @xmath86 denote the @xmath87-norm of the radom - nykodim derivative of @xmath47 relative to @xmath9 .",
    "this derivative is defined for each @xmath51 since @xmath47 is dominated by @xmath9 by construction . whenever @xmath9 does not assign positive mass to the set @xmath88 , the value of @xmath89 will usually tend to infinity as @xmath55 tends to zero .",
    "the rate at which this occurs will be critical in our study of the technical conditions listed in theorem [ representation ] . here and throughout , given a function @xmath90 , we define @xmath91 and @xmath92 for any set @xmath93 .",
    "we also denote by @xmath94 the support of @xmath47 .      by virtue of being a projection ,",
    "@xmath60 is expected to solve a collection of score - like equations , including that exhibited in condition ( a1 ) .",
    "the following theorem establishes formal regularity conditions validating this heuristic argument .",
    "[ a1 ] condition ( a1 ) holds provided either of the following conditions is true :    1 .   for some parametric submodel @xmath95 where @xmath96 is an interval containing zero and @xmath97 ,",

    "the radon - nikodym derivative of @xmath56 relative to @xmath60 is uniformly bounded in @xmath101-norm .",
    "the tangent space of @xmath3 at @xmath60 is the collection of scores and elements that can be approximated arbitrarily well by a linear combination of scores . under condition ( a ) in the above theorem , the result is established automatically since then @xmath67 is itself a score .",
    "condition ( b ) is a relatively milder condition .",
    "it is expected to hold in some generality since @xmath102 for @xmath21 and any @xmath51 , and as such , the random - nykodim derivative of @xmath56 relative to @xmath60 equals one at @xmath21 . under reasonable continuity , in any small neighborhood of @xmath20 values near zero , this derivative is expected to be bounded in @xmath101-norm .",
    "additionally , any region supported by @xmath56 and in which @xmath60 assigns negligible probability mass makes a large negative contribution to the log - likelihood criterion in , thereby thwarting the objective of maximizing the likelihood .",
    "this observation further supports the plausibility of condition ( b ) , and in fact guarantees it in the context of any finitely - supported @xmath56 .",
    "we relied on certain notions of continuity to establish the validity of representations and .",
    "the theorem below highlights how the continuity requirement stated in condition ( a2 ) can be more concretely verified .",
    "[ a2 ] suppose that @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "condition ( a2 ) holds provided either    \\(a ) @xmath105  or  ( b ) @xmath106 .",
    "the requirement that @xmath107 approximates @xmath26 as @xmath55 tends to zero simply stipulates that averaging @xmath25 with respect to a distribution eventually concentrating all its probability mass on @xmath88 should approximately yield @xmath26 .",
    "furthermore , this theorem requires that @xmath108 tends to zero , which is reasonable under some continuity since @xmath67 tends to @xmath25 and @xmath109 . beyond this , in order for condition ( a2 ) to hold , it suffices either for @xmath67 to approximate @xmath25 in supremum norm over the support of @xmath47 or in @xmath87-norm at a rate faster than @xmath110 .",
    "these statements each hinge on a certain notion of continuity that appears needed whenever @xmath9 is not finitely - supported and nearly degenerate distributions must be used in defining the linear perturbation paths .",
    "the proof of representations and hinges upon a linearization of the difference between @xmath111 and @xmath112 . to ignore the remainder term from this linearization , we require that @xmath113 be arbitrarily small for small enough @xmath55 and sufficiently smaller @xmath20 .",
    "the following theorem establishes a bound on @xmath82 in terms of @xmath20 and @xmath55 under mild conditions .",
    "it also clarifies how @xmath20 and @xmath55 must be chosen to guarantee condition ( a3 ) .",
    "[ a3 ] suppose that there exists an interval @xmath114\\subset ( 0,+\\infty)$ ] such that for each small @xmath55 the radon - nikodym derivative of @xmath60 relative to @xmath9 is uniformly contained in @xmath115 over the support of @xmath9 for sufficiently small @xmath20 .",
    "suppose also that there exist some @xmath116 such that for any @xmath31 with radon - nikodym relative to @xmath9 bounded above by @xmath117 over the support of @xmath9 we have that @xmath118 then , it is true that @xmath119 ^ 2 $ ] is bounded for small @xmath55 and sufficiently smaller @xmath20 .",
    "thus , condition ( a3 ) holds if @xmath120 is selected such that @xmath121 as @xmath55 tends to zero .    as discussed in the previous subsection , since @xmath122 for any value @xmath51 whenever @xmath21 , the derivative of @xmath60 relative to @xmath9 is indeed expected to be uniformly bounded above and away from zero for small enough @xmath55 and sufficiently smaller @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , it is often the case that the remainder term , as being a second - order term arising from a linearization , can be bounded by the squared norm of the difference between the derivative of @xmath60 relative to @xmath9 and its value at @xmath21 .",
    "this inequality often follows quite easily from an application of the cauchy - schwartz inequality on the remainder term .",
    "it is easy to verify in common examples and generally holds under rather mild conditions .",
    "the representations presented in theorem [ representation ] provide the theoretical foundations for numerically approximating the eif and thus for numerically constructing efficient estimators .",
    "the implementation of the approach suggested by these representations nevertheless presents specific challenges .",
    "practical guidelines , as provided below , may facilitate the successful implementation of our proposal by practitioners .      in constructing the linear perturbation path that defines @xmath56 and thus @xmath60 ,",
    "the nearly degenerate distribution at @xmath88 is used instead of its purely degenerate counterpart because it ensures that all distributions along the perturbation path are dominated by @xmath9 .",
    "this is required to ensure the validity of the representations we have proposed .",
    "clearly , there is no need for smoothing in the components of the data unit for which the corresponding marginal distribution implied by @xmath9 is dominated by a counting measure .",
    "in fact , as we stress below , unnecessary smoothing will needlessly increase the computational burden of the approximation procedure . for components for which the corresponding marginal distribution is dominated by the lebesgue measure , smoothing is generally needed . in practice , we suggest the use of product kernels for those components .",
    "specifically , suppose that the data unit @xmath46 is @xmath0-dimensional and can be partitioned into @xmath123 , where @xmath124 and @xmath125 with @xmath126 , and that the marginal distributions of @xmath127 and @xmath128 under @xmath9 are respectively dominated by the lebesgue measure and a discrete counting measure . in this case , we can typically use the product kernel @xmath129\\times\\left[\\prod_{j=1}^{d_2}i(u_{\\textnormal{c}j}=x_{\\textnormal{c}j})\\right]\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath130 with @xmath131 and @xmath132 possible realizations of @xmath127 and @xmath128 , respectively , and @xmath133 with @xmath134 some symmetric , absolutely continuous density function .",
    "the uniform kernel @xmath135 is particularly appealing due to its simplicity , which translates to greater practical feasibility of our numerical approximation procedure .",
    "if the uniform kernel is used , it is easy to verify that @xmath136 provided , for example , @xmath137 is continuous and bounded away from zero in a neighborhood of @xmath138 .",
    "thus , to ensure that condition ( a3 ) is satisfied , theorem [ a3 ] suggests choosing @xmath20 such that @xmath139 .",
    "if @xmath140 is large , this requirement may be prohibitive , possibly even to the point of requiring a value of @xmath20 beyond the computer s default level of precision and thus requiring special computational techniques .",
    "of course , while this guideline is sufficient , it may be overly conservative in some applications . in the next subsection , we provide a practical means of selecting the value of @xmath20 and @xmath55 .    as alluded to above ,",
    "if we include smoothing over @xmath128 as well in our choice of @xmath47 , we need @xmath141 .",
    "this can be much more prohibitive computationally than requiring that @xmath139 , particularly if @xmath142 is large .",
    "for this reason , smoothing in the construction of the linear perturbation path should be avoided for all components except those for which the corresponding marginal distribution under @xmath9 is absolutely continuous . additionally , for some parameters ,",
    "smoothing can be avoided altogether for certain continuous components . as a general guideline for which supporting theory remains to be developed , we expect that no components require smoothing if the parameter is sufficiently smooth at @xmath5 in the sense that @xmath143 tends to @xmath112 for any sequence @xmath144 for which the cumulative distribution of @xmath145 tends to that of @xmath9 uniformly as @xmath146 tends to infinity . alternatively , if the mle @xmath147 of @xmath9 based on observations @xmath1 from @xmath9 is such that @xmath148 is a consistent estimator of @xmath112 , no smoothing will generally be required .",
    "if , however , some regularization of the mle is needed to ensure consistency ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , smoothing will usually be critical .",
    "when the pathwise derivative in can be calculated analytically , the approximation method proposed only involves the smoothing parameter @xmath55 .",
    "the supporting theory clearly suggests choosing @xmath55 to be as small as possible . as we will illustrate in section [ illustrations ] , in some cases",
    "there is little sensitivity to the choice of @xmath55 when is used , and even a relatively large value of @xmath51 will yield stringent control of the approximation error .",
    "whenever the involved projection is not available in closed form or differentiation with respect to @xmath20 is too cumbersome to perform analytically , the secant line slope may be used to numerically approximate this analytic derivative . in such case ,",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath55 must both be chosen , and more care is needed to ensure the reliability of the proposed procedure .",
    "the order of the limits in and suggests that we must select a small value of @xmath55 and even smaller value of @xmath20 .",
    "this was made more precise in section [ theory ] , where it is prescribed to choose @xmath20 to be much smaller than @xmath149 , where @xmath140 is the number of components of @xmath9 over which smoothing is required . while this theoretical requirement may serve as a rough guide in practice",
    ", it does not provide a concrete means of selecting values for @xmath20 and @xmath55 .",
    "for this purpose , it may be useful to produce a matrix representing the value of @xmath85 as a function of @xmath20 and @xmath55 , both ranging over an exponential scale  for example , we could consider both @xmath20 and @xmath55 in the set @xmath150 .",
    "we refer to the resulting display as an epsilon - lambda plot . as a convention",
    ", the y - axis is used to represent @xmath20 values while @xmath55 values are represented on the x - axis .",
    "our theoretical findings suggest that the right balance between @xmath20 and @xmath55 will be achieved in a possibly curvilinear triangular region nested in the upper left portion of the epsilon - lambda plot . in this triangular region",
    ", the secant line slope should be essentially constant .",
    "one practical means of selecting @xmath20 and @xmath55 would then consist of identifying this region visually by determining the quasi - triangular region in the upper left portion of the matrix over which the approximated eif value is fixed up to a certain level of precision .",
    "as an illustration , without yet providing details regarding the specific parameter and model under consideration , we may scrutinize the epsilon - lambda plot arising in example 1 from section 5 .",
    "this plot is provided as figure 1 and clearly suggests that , up to three decimal points , the eif value of interest is -0.963 .",
