    "a fundamental principle of field theory is that we do not need to know the details of a particular theory at arbitrarily short distances to be able to use it to make physical predictions .",
    "this ignorance is permissible not because the corrections from high energies are small ; in fact they usually are infinitely large . instead",
    ", our ignorance of the short distance behavior of the theory can be absorbed into the redefinition of the parameters describing the theory .",
    "the predictions can then be expressed in terms of a finite number of parameters associated with a set of local operators . in this renormalized theory ,",
    "higher order corrections , which are usually defined as power series in a small rescaled coupling , remain small .",
    "what we have lost in this process is the idea of fixed , constant parameters ; coupling `` constants '' now depend upon the scale at which they have been defined .",
    "the behavior of a field theory in the early universe appears to violate this principle of decoupling  at least at a first glance .",
    "a distinctive feature of inflation @xcite is the superluminal stretching of length scales which allows quantum field fluctuations during the inflationary phase to induce the metric perturbations that seed the large scale structure of the universe .",
    "the observed spectrum of acoustic peaks in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and , even more strikingly , the detection of anticorrelations in the polarization and temperature anisotropies at superhorizon scales are both completely consistent with the predictions of inflation @xcite .",
    "how much expansion occurred during inflation depends on the expansion rate and its duration , but with more than the 6070 @xmath0-folds usually demanded of inflation , the scales associated with the large - scale structure we see today would have had their origin in fluctuations at sub - planckian scales during the early universe .",
    "most models for inflation typically produce significantly more expansion than this minimum requirement .",
    "this apparent violation of decoupling has been called the `` trans - planckian problem '' of inflation @xcite , but it can also be regarded as an opportunity , since it suggests that physics that is important at length scales much smaller than those accessible to accelerator experiments could have left its imprint on the cmb .",
    "because of this unique opportunity , much effort @xcite has been devoted recently to determining under what conditions such effects could be seen , usually within a particular framework for the near - planck scale physics that determines the state of the inflaton .",
    "the expansion rate during inflation defines a natural scale , @xmath1 , the hubble scale , and if the new physics above this scale has a mass @xmath2 associated with it , then the `` trans - planckian '' signal is generally found to be suppressed by @xmath3 , or more , relative to the vacuum result .",
    "here the vacuum corresponds to the state that is invariant under the symmetries of the background space - time and that matches with the usual idea for the minkowski space vacuum at distances much shorter than the curvature of the background , @xmath4 .",
    "while these approaches have been very illuminating since they have provided a clear estimate for the expected size of the trans - planckian signal in the cmb , they have generally been rather _",
    "ad hoc _ in that they assume some particular feature for the physics near the planck scale or they chose a particular initial state . in this sense",
    ", they do not really address the underlying trans - planckian problem ",
    "why we should expect to observe a cmb spectrum that essentially agrees with that produced by assuming that the universe is in its vacuum state at all scales , without any _ a priori _ assumptions about physics near the planck scale .",
    "the setting for a field theory in the early universe is somewhat different than that generally assumed in an @xmath5-matrix calculation @xcite .",
    "the field begins in some state specified at an initial time , @xmath6 , which does not need to correspond to an asymptotically well - behaved state in the infinite past or which was an energy eigenstate of the free hamiltonian .",
    "depending upon the space - time geometry , a globally conserved energy may not even exist .",
    "this initial state can have short distance features imprinted upon it either from a preceding phase where heavy fields were excited or at length scales shorter than the planck length , where gravitational effects can become strong .",
    "what is therefore needed is an extension of the ideas of effective field theory @xcite for describing the features of an arbitrary initial state . in this article",
    "we describe how the renormalization of this short distance information in the initial state proceeds in minkowski space .",
    "an initial state can be broadly classified as renormalizable or nonrenormalizable by how its behavior differs from the vacuum state at short distances .",
    "the new divergences associated with the short distance features of the initial state are cancelled by counterterms localized at the surface where the initial state is defined .",
    "not surprisingly , the renormalizable initial states are associated with relevant or marginal operators on the initial surface while the nonrenormalizable initial states require irrelevant boundary counterterms .    to begin",
    ", we must understand what constitutes a renormalizable initial state  where the divergences in the bare theory occur and how they can be removed by the appropriate counterterms which are consistent with the symmetries left unbroken by the state .",
    "an important aspect is the statement of a renormalization condition for this setting , since it is through this condition that the renormalized theory acquires its dependence on the renormalization scale .",
    "the callan - symanzik equation then determines the running of the usual couplings and field rescalings as well as the scale dependence of the effects associated with the initial condition .",
    "the second important aspect of an effective treatment of the initial state is characterizing and understanding the role of nonrenormalizable initial conditions . in the modern view of field theory ,",
    "nonrenormalizable operators are not unphysical but are merely a sign that a theory is not intended to be valid to arbitrarily high energies .",
    "the coefficient of a nonrenormalizable operator of dimension @xmath7 is of the order @xmath8 , where @xmath2 is a mass scale .",
    "if we study phenomena at an energy @xmath9 , then the effects of the nonrenormalizable operators will be suppressed by powers @xmath10 .",
    "as long as @xmath11 and we do not demand an arbitrary accuracy of our prediction , we only need to consider a finite set of operators .",
    "as @xmath12 , the effective description breaks down .",
    "but once we are able to probe such energies , we should see the dynamics that gave rise to the higher dimension operators of our lower energy effective theory and that description is replaced by another effective theory appropriate for the scale @xmath13 .",
    "similarly , nonrenormalizable initial conditions naturally introduce a mass scale @xmath2 . to make a prediction at a length @xmath14 sufficiently larger than @xmath15 and to specified accuracy @xmath16and in the measurement of the cmb we shall probably always have a larger error than we would like ",
    "then we need only that finite set of parameters describing the initial state suppressed by no more than @xmath17 powers of @xmath18 where @xmath17 is defined by @xmath19 .",
    "there are additional parameters associated with the still finer details of the initial state , but these are increasing irrelevant , being suppressed by further powers of @xmath18 and are not needed in practice until we can make more precise measurements ( decreasing @xmath16 ) or are able to probe the shorter distance features directly ( increasing @xmath20 ) .",
    "what has happened is that we have replaced an assumption about the details of the planck scale physics setting the initial state with a small set of parameters needed to describe how the state differs from the vacuum at short distances and which is applicable for any short distance completion of the theory .    despite the power and the generality of the effective field theory perspective ,",
    "this approach has not been widely applied to inflation .",
    "@xcite derived the expected size of the corrections to the cmb power spectrum from higher order operators , but still worked in the standard vacuum state .",
    "one of the earliest attempts to model initial state effects in the spirit of effective field theory integrated out the dynamics of a heavy field to learn of its imprint on the cmb @xcite ; but the first attempt for a general effective description of initial state effects has only appeared quite recently @xcite .    the essential feature of the renormalization of an initial state to understand is how to control the infinities that arise from having short distance features in this state that differ from the standard vacuum .",
    "it is important to note that for a robertson - walker universe the vacuum corresponds to the state that matches with the minkowski space vacuum at distances sufficiently small that the background curvature is not noticeable . since the curvature is unimportant where the renormalization is needed , the appropriate setting in which to begin is minkowski space",
    "it is also simpler in flat space to examine the structure of a state and its renormalization analytically .",
    "as we consider a completely general initial state , we shall use the schwinger - keldysh formalism @xcite to define the time - evolution of a general green s function in this setting .",
    "once we have understood the initial state renormalization in flat space , we shall have the necessary foundation for proceeding to a general robertson - walker space - time .",
    "the expansion of the background affects how and when we should choose an initial state .",
    "the expansion rate @xmath1 , from an effective theory perspective , just sets the appropriate scale with respect to which we define the infrared ( ir ) and ultraviolet ( uv ) details of the initial state .",
    "but the continual blueshifting that occurs as we look further back during inflation means that we must also choose an appropriate initial time at which to set the initial conditions defining the state @xcite , which is naturally and readily accomplished in the schwinger - keldysh picture . both of these details will be addressed in @xcite .",
    "the next section begins with a description of how an initial condition alters the structure of the propagator .",
    "the need for the consistency of the propagator with the state is quite familiar from studies of interacting theories @xcite for the @xmath21-vacua of de sitter space @xcite .",
    "one of the new features here is a part of the propagator that depends on the initial state , which gives rise to divergences not present for the vacuum state .",
    "section [ rencon ] describes how to renormalize the theory in this setting , by establishing an appropriate renormalization condition and showing that we obtain the usual running for the state - independent part of the theory .",
    "section [ bndren ] then shows that all of the initial - state - dependent divergences are localized on the boundary where the initial condition was imposed .",
