    "the recent measurement of the yield of double charged ions in photoionization of helium @xcite-@xcite confirmed the exitance of the _ quasifree mechanism _ ( qfm ) of the double photoionization which was predicted in @xcite .",
    "the differential cross sections of the double photoionization were calculated earlier in a number of papers @xcite@xcite , where the authors studied the distributions in characteristics of each photoelectron . in the pioneering experiments @xcite-@xcite the distribution in momentum transferred to the nucleus @xmath0 ( recoil momentum ) was measured .",
    "thus the problem of calculation of such distributions as @xmath1 with @xmath2 the energy of one of the photoelectrons and @xmath3 became actual .",
    "in the present paper we calculate these differential cross sections for the double photoionization of helium at high values of the photon energies , corresponding , however , to nonrelativistic energies of the photoelectrons .",
    "we present the results for the differential cross sections @xmath1 we trace the dependence of these characteristics on the photon energy @xmath4 .",
    "recall that the experiments @xcite-@xcite in which the photons carried the energies @xmath5ev , @xmath6 ev and @xmath7ev demonstrated that the distribution of outgoing electrons obtains a surplus at small @xmath8 of about 2 a.u .",
    "the kinematics of these experiments enables to separate the non - dipole contributions at small values of @xmath8 .",
    "thus the observed surplus is entirely due to the non - dipole terms .    by that time",
    "only two mechanisms of the process were known . in both of them",
    "the electron which interacted with the photon directly obtained almost all the incoming photon energy @xmath4 . in the first one , known as the _ shake - off _",
    "the secondary electron is pushed to continuum by to the sudden change of the effective field . in the second , called the _ knock - out _ mechanism , the photoelectron inelastically collides with the bound one , sharing the photon energy .",
    "both mechanisms contain the single photoionization as the first step .",
    "this process can not take place on a free electron .",
    "thus the momentum @xmath8 which is transferred in this step to the nucleus exceeds strongly the averaged momentum of the bound electron @xmath9 , in the case of the high energy photon @xmath10 ( @xmath11 is the single - particle ionization potential ) . of course , there is a configuration in which the second electron transfers momentum @xmath12 such as @xmath13 .",
    "however since each act of transferring a large momentum @xmath14 leads to an additional small factor @xcite , @xcite its probability is very small .",
    "the distribution @xmath1 provided by these two mechanisms peaks at @xmath15 ( m is the electron mass ) , becoming very small at @xmath16 .",
    "this remains true beyond the dipole approximation .",
    "in contrast to a single electron case , the two electrons can absorb a photon without participation of the nucleus . in the free process @xmath17 . in the qfm small momentum @xmath16",
    "is transferred to the nucleus , i.e. @xmath8 is much smaller than the momenta of the outgoing electrons .",
    "the distributions @xmath1 and @xmath3 the have local maxima at small @xmath8 of the order of @xmath18 . that s what was detected in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "momentum @xmath19 transferred to the nucleus can be written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 are momenta of the outgoing electrons , while @xmath22 is that of the photon .",
    "the recoil momentum @xmath8 can become small only if the large momenta of the outgoing photoelectron with @xmath23 compensate each other to large extent ( @xmath24 is always much smaller than @xmath25 while we consider the photon energies , corresponding to nonrelativistic photoelectrons ) .",
    "hence the values of @xmath25 should be close , i.e. @xmath26 with @xmath27 the sum of the energies of the photoelectrons .",
    "thus in qfm the bound electrons exchange by small momentum @xmath16 with the nucleus and by large momentum of the order @xmath28 between themselves .",
    "we calculate the amplitude of the qfm in the lowest order of expansion in powers of @xmath29 .",
    "this corresponds to expansion of the bound state wave function in the lowest order in powers of @xmath30 , with @xmath31 standing for the distance between the electron and the nucleus , while @xmath32 is the interelectron distance .",
    "we consider the high energy photons , corresponding however to nonrelativistic energies of the outgoing electrons .",
    "thus we assume that @xmath33 .",
    "having in mind future extension of the analysis to the relativistic case we employ the relativistic units @xmath34 .    since @xmath16",
    "the higher terms of expansion in powers of @xmath29 are of the same order as those coming from the interactions between the photoelectrons and the nucleus .",
    "however , they are of quite different physical origin . thus we include interactions of the nucleus with the electrons exactly , describing the latter by the nonrelativistic functions of the coulomb field .",
    "interaction between the outgoing electrons is proportional to the square of its sommerfeld parameter @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is their relative velocity . for the energies of the order @xmath37 kev , employed in the experiments @xcite-@xcite this interaction provides a correction of the order of 2 @xmath38 and",
    "can be neglected .",
    "direct relation of the qfm to the behavior of the bound state wave function @xmath39 at small distance @xmath32 was demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the qfm amplitude contains the factor @xmath40 at @xmath41 , which is connected to the function @xmath42 by the kato cusp condition @xcite .",
    "the latter appears to be very important for calculation of the qfm amplitude @xcite .",
    "we employ very precise wave function @xcite which satisfy also the kato cusp conditions .",
    "we use an analytical function which approximate these wave functions at the electron coalescence line @xmath41 very accurately @xcite .",
    "we include only the quadrupole part of the electron - photon interaction .",
    "note that the amplitude contains also the dipole terms proportional to the product @xmath43 with @xmath44 the vector of the photon polarization .",
    "however , at least in the leading approximation it is canceled by the contribution in which the electrons exchange by large momentum in the final state @xcite . anyway , in the experiments @xcite-@xcite the observations were carried out in the plane where @xmath45 .",
    "thus we can focus on the quadrupole contribution .",
    "besides the conservation of the linear momentum expressed by eq.([3 ] ) we write the energy conservation condition @xmath46 where @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) are the photoelectron energies .",
    "note that in our system of units @xmath49 .    to simplify the calculations we restrict ourselves to the case",
    "when the photon wave length is much larger than the size of the bound state , i.e. @xmath50 for the atom of helium this means that @xmath51 kev . under this condition eq.([3 ] ) can be written as @xmath52 in the lowest order of expansion in powers of @xmath22 .",
    "momentum @xmath8 can become as small as @xmath9 only if momenta of the outgoing electrons almost compensate each other , i.e. @xmath53 .",
    "hence , the photoelectrons are emitted mostly \" back - to - back , with @xmath54 close to @xmath55 , while the values @xmath56 , i.e. @xmath57 . thus the relative difference of the energies of the outgoing electrons @xmath58 should be small . since @xmath59",
    "we find @xmath60 this equation is presented in the lowest order in @xmath61 .    besides the distributions @xmath1 and @xmath3 we calculate the differential cross sections @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "we present the numerical data for the photons carrying the energy of about @xmath37 kev , employed in the experiments @xcite-@xcite .",
    "note that this approach was used in @xcite for calculation of the distributions @xmath62 and @xmath64 at the point of the peak @xmath65 .",
    "in other words in @xcite the height of the peak of this distributions was found . in the present paper",
    "we calculate the shape of the peaks .",
    "the differential cross section of the double photoionization can be written as @xmath66 here @xmath67 is the amplitude of the process .",
    "averaging over polarizations of the photon is assumed .",
    "the last factor is the phase volume @xmath68 employing eq.([5 ] ) we can present @xmath69 with @xmath70 the direction of momentum @xmath71 . using @xmath72-function for integration over @xmath73",
    "we can write @xmath74 with @xmath75 the solid angle of the photoelectron with momentum @xmath71 , @xmath76 .",
    "the amplitude of the process can be written as @xmath77 with the numbers @xmath37 and @xmath78 denote the variables corresponding to two electrons , @xmath79 are the wave functions of the initial and final states , @xmath80 where @xmath44 is the vector of polarization of the photon , @xmath81 . recall that we shall pick only the quadrupole terms of interaction between the photon end electron .",
    "for further evaluation we denote @xmath82 as we said earlier , we describe the final state by the function @xmath83 where @xmath84 are the single - particle nonrelativistic coulomb field function with asymptotic momenta @xmath85 .",
    "we shall need the functions @xmath86 here @xmath87 while @xmath88 with @xmath89 here @xmath90 is the charge of the nucleus .",
    "note that in the hydrogenlike approximation @xmath18 is the averaged momentum of the electron in the @xmath91 state .",
    "thus @xmath92 @xmath93 here we denoted @xmath94 introduce @xmath95 presenting @xmath96 and @xmath97 we obtain @xmath98 with @xmath99 while @xmath100 where @xmath101    since @xmath102 , the integrals on the right hand sides of eqs.([24 ] ) , ( [ 25 ] ) are saturated by @xmath103 . thus we can put @xmath104 in the functions @xmath105 .",
    "this provides @xmath106 now we expand the wave function @xmath107 here @xmath108 , the derivatives are taken at @xmath109 .",
    "we can calculate the integral over @xmath110 multiplying the integrand by @xmath111 and putting @xmath112 in the final step .",
    "@xmath113 @xmath114 .",
    "the derivative @xmath115 at @xmath116 is related to the wave function by the kato cusp condition @xcite    @xmath117    where @xmath118 is the bohr radius .",
    "it is identical to similar relation for the wave function presented in variables @xmath119,@xmath120,@xmath110 . introducing @xmath121",
    "we can write @xmath122 with @xmath123 with the functions @xmath124 defined by eq.([19a ] ) .    combining eqs .",
    "( [ 13 ] , [ 19 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 26 ] ) we find for the quadrupole terms of the amplitude @xmath125 after averaging over the photon polarization and integration over the angles eq.([10 ] ) takes the form @xmath126    in order to calculate @xmath127 we employ the presentation of the function @xmath128 with numerical values of the parameters @xmath129 found in@xcite .",
    "the further calculations are described in appendix .",
    "we obtain for the function @xmath127 defined by eq.([28a ] ) @xmath130 with @xmath131 defined by eq.([39 ] ) .",
    "now we present the results of computations . the cross section @xmath132 determined by eq.([50 ] )",
    "is presented in a three - dimensional fig.1 for @xmath133 ev . as expected",
    ", it obtains the largest values at small @xmath134 and in the region of small @xmath135 in agreement with the experimental results @xcite .",
    "this distribution at @xmath136 , corresponding to the center of the spectrum is shown in fig.2 for @xmath137 and @xmath138 kev .",
    "since the effects of finite @xmath61 manifest themselves in the terms of the order @xmath139 , there is no noticeable difference from similar figures for @xmath140 in the qfm region due to eq.([6 ] ) .",
    "it is instructive also to view the energy distribution of the angular correlation @xmath141 it is shown for @xmath142 ev in the three - dimensional fig.4 .",
    "as expected , the largest values are reached at @xmath134 and @xmath143 close to @xmath55 , corresponding to the electrons ejected in the opposite directions ( `` back - to back '' ) .",
    "for @xmath136 this differential cross section is shown in fig.4 for @xmath137 and @xmath138 kev .",
    "we calculate also the distribution in recoil momentum @xmath144 and the angular correlation @xmath145 they are presented in fig.5 and fig.6 correspondingly .",
    "as expected , the distribution @xmath146 has a local maximum at @xmath8 about @xmath37 a.u . at @xmath147",
    "this distribution turns to zero just because the interval of integration over @xmath61 vanishes .",
    "the angular correlation @xmath148 has a sharp peak at @xmath65 , in agreement with the previous analysis .",
    "we calculated the distributions in recoil momenta @xmath8 and their energy distribution for the high energy nonrelativistic double photoionization of helium caused by the quasifree mechanism ( qfm)@xcite .",
    "they are closely related to the distributions in the angle between momenta of the outgoing electrons ( angular correlations ) .",
    "as expected , the distributions in recoil momenta obtain local maxima at small @xmath8 of the order @xmath149 a.u .",
    ", in agreement with the results of the pioneering experiments @xcite-@xcite . unfortunately",
    ", the way of presentation of the results in @xcite-@xcite does not permit to compare the quantitative results .",
    "the corresponding angular distributions obtain maxima when the photoelectrons move in the opposite directions ( `` back - to - back '' scattering ) .",
    "the qualitative picture is the same for heavier atoms .",
    "the qfm is caused by the initial state interactions and , contrary to a misleading statement in @xcite , is contained in the standard feynman diagrams for the amplitude @xcite . since the qfm is at work at small separation between the bound electrons @xmath32 , we described the initial state by a very precise wave function @xcite , employing its analytical approximation at small values of @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "we neglected the electron interactions in the final state .",
    "the numerical results for the photon energies in the kev region are shown in figs.1 - 6 .",
    "this energy region attracts attention nowadays in connection with the laser experiments . also",
    ", the experiments @xcite-@xcite where carried out at these energies . the approach can be applied for the double photoionization of heavier atoms .",
    "one can obtain more precise results by direct employing of precise wave functions , i.e. those found in @xcite .",
    "however , such approaches do not allow to analyze the mechanisms of the process .",
    "on the other hand very `` accurate '' wave functions ( i.e. those which reproduce the value of the binding energy very accurately ) may have a wrong behavior at @xmath150 .",
    "it was demonstrated in @xcite , @xcite that a number of publications on the subject employing such functions contain erroneous results .",
    "more examples are given in @xcite .",
    "that is why we consider our results as a necessary step in investigation of the process .",
    "there is a number of possibilities to carry out the experimental investigation of other phenomena connected with the qfm . outside the plane @xmath151 interference between the dipole and quadrupole terms",
    "should manifest itself in the angular distributions .",
    "also , it would be interesting to trace the @xmath4 dependence of the shape of the energy distribution .",
    "its theoretical analysis was presented in @xcite .",
    "thus we calculate the integral @xmath152 where @xmath153 with @xmath154 the integral @xmath155 was calculated in @xcite as @xmath156 with @xmath157 @xmath158 we write eq([33 ] ) in a more symmetric form @xmath159 with @xmath160 thus @xmath161 with @xmath162 employing @xmath163 we find @xmath164 here @xmath165 while @xmath166 @xmath167 with @xmath168"
