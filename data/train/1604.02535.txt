    "we are developing an imaging array of transition edge sensor ( tes ) microcalorimeters for future x - ray astronomy mission like edge ( explorer of the diffuse emission and gamma - ray burst explosions)@xcite , xeus @xcite and constellation - x@xcite .",
    "the experiment described here is part of the european - japanese project eureca , which aims to demonstrate technological readiness of a 5 x 5 pixel array of tes - based micro - calorimeters read - out by two squid - amplifier channels using frequency - domain - multiplexing ( fdm ) @xcite . we discuss here the details of the detector set - up and the first results of the tests made using synchrotron radiation at the ptb beamline of the bessy ii @xcite .",
    "the aim of the campaign was to test the sensor behaviour to investigate crucial detector issues like calibration of the energy scale , non linearity , large signal analysis and energy resolution retrieval from pile - up events .",
    "a cross section of the experimental set - up is shown in fig .  [ set - up ] .",

    "the tes is voltage - biased with a @xmath5 ( thevenin equivalent ) load resistance , and kept at the transition by negative electro - thermal feedback ( etf ) @xcite .",
    "the current through the tes was measured by a 100-squid array operated in flux locked loop ( fll ) .",
    "the inductance of the squid input coil is @xmath6 nh . the squid array is directly read out by a low noise commercial ptb - magnicon electronics .",
    "the detector has been integrated in a janis two - stage adr cooler precooled at 3.5 k by a mechanical cryomech pulse tube ( pt ) .    to reduce the electro - magnetic interferences from the external environment ,",
    "the detector cold - head , the harness and the room temperature electronics is fully enclosed in a dedicated faraday cage . in the cold stage ,",
    "the faraday cage is formed by a double shield anchored at @xmath7 consisting of a cryoperm shield and a copper load - tin plated superconducting shield .",
    "the cryostat is foreseen of windows along the optical path of the detector .",
    "we employ two 150 nm aluminium filters , each supported on a 200 nm parylene substrate , respectively placed on the 60 and 3.5 k cryostat shields .",
    "we characterised the detector using the soft x - ray two plane grating monochromator beam - line ( sx700 ) in the ptb laboratory at bessy ii synchrotron facility in berlin @xcite .",
    "the photons energy can be selected with high resolution ( @xmath8 ev ) in the range from 50 to 1800 ev .",
    "the radiation flux can be easily change from a few tenths to thousands of photons per second .",
    "we report here the results of the measurement campaign at ptb - bessy .",
    "a detailed characterisation of the single pixel thermal and electrical responsivity can be found in @xcite @xcite .",
    "we study the microcalorimeter detector by measuring the energy resolution in the energy range from @xmath9 ev to @xmath10 kev and for the microcalorimeter optimum bias point observed at @xmath11 and zero perpendicular magnetic field , @xmath12 mg obtained by cancelling the remanent magnetic field with an auxiliary superconducting coil .",
    "the base temperature was @xmath13 mk and stabilised at a level of @xmath14 rms for all the measurements described in this paper .",
    "the dependence from the tes bias point and the applied perpendicular static magnetic field was also studied and will be discussed .    in fig .",
    "[ devse].*a . *",
    "the energy resolution is shown as a function of the incident photon energy . in the graph we plotted with full circles the x - ray energy resolution obtained after applying the matched filter to each single photon .",
    "the open circles show the baseline resolution obtained by filtering the detector noise with the same filter used for the x - ray pulses .",
    "when the instrumental resolution of the detector is dominated by random noise , the baseline resolution is equal to the x - ray resolution . at 250 ev we measured the best energy resolution of @xmath15 ev",

    ", the energy resolution can be approximated , in the small signal analysis , as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the tes transition temperature,@xmath19 and @xmath20 describe respectively the temperature and current dependent tes transition steepness and @xmath21 is the steady - state joule power . the pulse fall time is calculated to be @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 is determined by the heat transport mechanism .",
    "m represents the ratio of the level of excess noise to the johnson noise as described by ullom et al .",
    "the theoretical energy resolution ( @xmath25 ) for this sensor is estimated to be @xmath26 ev .",
    "the observed dependency of the energy resolution on the photons energy is related to the change of the pulse fall time as a function of energy shown in fig .",
    "[ devse].*b*. in a neighbourhood of this particular bias point the sensor parameters like @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath27 are changing quite rapidly @xcite , leading to a strong dependence of the @xmath28 on the signal amplitude and thus the energy . from eq .",
    "[ defwhm ] and the polynomial curve obtained to fit the experimental measurements of @xmath28 as a function of energy we derive the dashed curve shown in fig .  [ devse ] , which gives the expected energy resolution in presence of excess noise for our sensor .",
    "we used @xmath29 , @xmath30 pw and we assumed them to be constant for all the energies .",
    "the behaviour of the x - ray and baseline resolution is qualitatively explained by eq .",
    "[ defwhm ] .",
    "the discrepancy between the measured baseline resolution and the calculated resolution is of only about @xmath31 .",
    "this could be due to the thermal fluctuation noise ( not include in the estimated @xmath32 due to the presence of a dangling heat capacitance thermally decoupled from the tes@xcite .",
    "the x - ray energy resolution is about @xmath33 worse than the baseline resolution .",
    "this may indicate that the applied matched filter is not optimal due to the non - stationary property of the noise . in that case one would expect however the difference to be larger at higher energy .",
    "drifts due to fluctuations of the bath temperature or magnetic field could also explain the discrepancy .",
    "[ highflux ] shows the energy distribution at @xmath34 ev for a count - rate as large as 500 photons per second . when large photon fluxes are applied to the calorimeter",
    "a slightly worse energy resolution is observed .",
    "however , as shown in the figure , for a radiation flux as large as 500 photons / sec we could still measure an energy resolution of @xmath35 ev . to produce the spectra we rejected about @xmath36 of events due to pile - up",
    ". the energy degradation could be due to a non perfect pile - up rejection or non - linear effects in the detector caused by the large number of photons reaching the microcalorimeter .",
    "the excess energy counts observed in the low energy side of the spectrum are due to photons not directly absorbed in the microcalorimeter absorber .",
    "this is consequence of the fact that the collimator opening is slightly larger than the absorber size .",
    "the data analysis for high fluxes is still in progress .",
    "the complete results will be presented in a future paper .    the dependency of the photon energy resolution on the tes bias point and magnetic field is shown in fig .",

    "the best energy resolution is observed for @xmath37 at zero perpendicular magnetic field @xmath38 in the tes .",
    "we observed a degradation of the energy resolution of about @xmath33 from the optimum when the tes is biased between @xmath33 and @xmath39 of @xmath40 .",
    "this is consistent with the results reported by y.takei et al .",

    "mg the energy resolution becomes worse of about @xmath42 .",
    "we presented the response and energy resolution measurements of a single pixel tes microcalorimeter operating in an adr performed at the beam - line in the ptb radiometry laboratory at the electron storage ring bessy ii in the range from 200 to 1800 ev . at @xmath43",
    "ev we measured an energy resolution of @xmath44 ev at the best bias point corresponding to a tes resistance @xmath11 , for zero perpendicular magnetic field and for a count rate of 50 photons / sec .",
    "the energy resolution was found to be dependent on the photon energy and is related to the change of the pulses fall time .",

    "/ sec reaching the detector an energy resolution of @xmath35 ev at @xmath34 ev was measured with a pile - up rejection of @xmath36 .",
