    "recent proposals of large extra dimensions use the concept of brane as a sub - manifold embedded in a higher dimensional spacetime , on which the standard model particles are confined .",

    "the fifth coordinate is compactified on @xmath5 , and the branes are on the two fixed points .",
    "it is assumed that all matter fields are confined on the branes and only the gravity propagates freely in the five dimensional bulk . in this model , the hierarchy problem is solved if the distance between the branes is about 37 times the ads radius and we live on the negative tension brane .",
    "more recently , alternatives to confining particles on the brane have been investigated and scenarios with additional bulk fields have been considered .    from the point of view of embedding the randall - sundrum model into a more fundamental theory , such as string / m - theory , one may expect that a more complete version of this scenario must admit the presence of additional extra dimensions compactified on an internal manifold . from a phenomenological point of view , higher dimensional theories with curved internal manifolds offer a richer geometrical and topological structure .",
    "the consideration of more general spacetimes may provide interesting extensions of the randall - sundrum mechanism for the geometric origin of the hierarchy .",
    "spacetimes with more than one extra dimension can allow for solutions with more appealing features , particularly in spacetimes where the curvature of the internal space is nonzero .",
    "more extra dimensions also relax the fine - tunings of the fundamental parameters .",
    "these models can provide a framework in the context of which the stabilization of the radion field naturally takes place .",
    "in addition , a richer topological structure of the field configuration in transverse space provides the possibility of more realistic spectrum of chiral fermions localized on the brane .",
    "several variants of the randall  sundrum scenario involving cosmic strings and other global defects of various codimensions have been investigated in higher dimensions ( see , for instance , @xcite-@xcite and references therein ) .",
