    "<S> we present results on the production of bound states of @xmath0 in nuclei using the @xmath1 reaction . by taking into account the states obtained within a wide range of strength of the @xmath0 nucleus optical potential , plus the possibility to replace different nucleons of the nucleus </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain an excitation spectra with clearly differentiated peaks . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of the calculated cross sections is well within reachable range .    </S>",
    "<S> the discovery of the @xmath0 at spring-8/osaka @xcite , followed by its confirmation in different other experiments , has made a substantial impact in hadronic physics ( see @xcite for a compilation of experimental and theoretical works on the issue ) . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility that there would be @xmath0 bound states in nuclei has not passed unnoticed and in @xcite the @xmath0 selfenergy in the nucleus was evaluated , however with only the part tied to the @xmath2 decay , which is known experimentally to be very small . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 potential obtained was too weak to bind @xmath0 in nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> suggestions of possible bound states within a schematic model for quark pair interaction with nucleons were made in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in that work a @xmath0 selfenergy in the nucleus </S>",
    "<S> was obtained of the same order as the contribution of the same mechanisms to the @xmath0 mass . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3 and @xmath4 reactions were also suggested in that work as a means to produce @xmath0 bound states in nuclei .    in a recent paper @xcite the possibility of having @xmath0 bound states in nuclei , tied to the @xmath5 content of the @xmath0 , was investigated and it was concluded that there is an attractive @xmath0 potential , which , within uncertainties , is strong enough to bind the @xmath0 in nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> restrictions from pauli blocking and binding reduce the @xmath0 width in nuclei to about one third or less of the free width , and with attractive @xmath0 nucleus potentials ranging from 60 to 120 mev at normal nuclear matter density , the separation between the deeper @xmath0 levels in light and medium nuclei is larger than the width , even in the case that the free @xmath0 width were as big as 15 mev . </S>",
    "<S> this is a desirable experimental situation in which clear peaks could be observed provided an appropriate reaction is used .    in @xcite the @xmath0 selfenergy tied to the @xmath2 decay </S>",
    "<S> was also studied and found to be very small like in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the large attraction found in @xcite is tied to the coupling of the @xmath0 to two mesons and a baryon which was related to the strong decay of the @xmath6 resonance to a nucleon and two pions .    in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the reaction @xmath1 in nuclei , which leads to clear peaks and a fair strength in the spectra of @xmath0 nuclear states . </S>",
    "<S> the reaction is of the substitutional type , in which one of the nucleons in the nucleus will be substituted by the @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , on top of the different @xmath0 bound states , we shall also have to take into account the binding energies of the nucleon levels in the nucleus when we look for the spectra of this reaction .    </S>",
    "<S> the analogous @xmath7 reaction has been a standard tool to produce @xmath8 hypernuclei @xcite and it was also used to see the only @xmath9 hypernucleus known so far @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there is an added difficulty here since one would wish to have a kinematics as close as possible to a recoilless condition , which makes the production cross sections larger . </S>",
    "<S> this is the case of the @xmath10 reaction , which was used with success to find the deeply bound pionic atoms @xcite . in the present case , </S>",
    "<S> given the fact that one has to create the excess mass of the @xmath0 over the nucleon from the kinetic energy of the kaon , this induces inevitably a momentum transfer , which reach a minimal value of the order of 450 mev / c for an initial @xmath11 momentum of around 620 mev / c . </S>",
    "<S> although this quantity is larger than the fermi momentum , it can still be accommodated in the @xmath0 wave function without much penalty , such that the cross sections obtained are still sizable .    </S>",
    "<S> we show the momentum transfer of the forward ( @xmath11,@xmath12 ) reactions for the @xmath0 nuclei formation as a function of the incident @xmath13 energy in fig.[fig : mom_trans ] . </S>",
    "<S> we can also expect to produce @xmath0 nuclear states by the ( @xmath14,@xmath15 ) and ( @xmath16 , @xmath15 ) reactions . </S>",
    "<S> however , the typical momentum transfer of these reactions are much larger than that of the ( @xmath11,@xmath12 ) reaction , and the formation rate of these reactions will be suppressed significantly . </S>",
    "<S> also the distortion of the @xmath11 is substantially weaker than that of the @xmath15 .    </S>",
    "<S> the cross section for the ( @xmath11,@xmath12 ) reaction for the formation of the @xmath0 bound states is given by , @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the @xmath20 and proton wavefunctions in bound states , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the momenta of the incident kaon and the emitted pion , respectively , and @xmath23 is the decay width of the final @xmath0 nuclear states . in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : d_sigma ] ) @xmath24 is defined as , @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the relativistic energies of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath28 is the proton separation energy from the target nucleus , @xmath29 is the @xmath20 binding energy in the final states and @xmath30 , @xmath31 are the proton and @xmath20 masses , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we sum up all contributions of proton single particle states in the target nucleus and @xmath20 bound states in the final states in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : d_sigma ] ) .    in order to take into account the distortion affecting the pion and kaon </S>",
    "<S> , we use the eikonal approximation , in which the distorted waves are approximated by plane waves with a distortion factor . the distortion factor @xmath32 appearing in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : d_sigma ] ) is defined as , @xmath33 , \\label{eq : distortion}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the kaon and pion selfenergies in the nuclear medium . </S>",
    "<S> the real part of @xmath34 is taken from the @xmath36 approximation @xcite @xmath37 which accounts for the largely dominant @xmath38wave interaction and the imaginary part , also from the @xmath36 approximation , is obtained using the optical theorem @xmath39 the pion selfenergy @xmath35 is taken from refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the matrix element @xmath40 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : d_sigma ] ) is the @xmath41 transition @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> we get this magnitude from the same lagrangian used in @xcite to obtain the @xmath0 nuclear potential . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 selfenergy in @xcite was obtained studying the excitation of intermediate states @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and incorporating the medium effects in the mesons and the nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> the part of the selfenergy tied to the @xmath43 channel was found very small , but the one tied to the @xmath44 channel led to a sizable attraction .    in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the following two lagrangians were used coupling the @xmath0 to @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 with @xmath47 the two mesons vector current , @xmath48 , @xmath49 the pion decay constant and @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 su(3 ) tensors which account for the antidecuplet states , the octet of @xmath53 baryons and the octet of @xmath54 mesons , respectively .    in ref.@xcite </S>",
    "<S> a study was done of the possible lagrangians coupling the antidecuplet states to two meson and one baryon under the assumptions of @xmath55 symmetry and minimal number of derivatives for each possible @xmath55 structure . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a possible chiral symmetric term was also studied as well as a mass term breaking explicitly chiral symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> it was found there that the two relevant structures were those in eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the chiral lagrangian gave results remarkably similar to those of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 6 ) and other terms as the chiral symmetry breaking term and one coming from the 27 @xmath55 representation had to have small strength from physical grounds . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude provided by the first lagrangian , in the nonrelativistic limit , is proportional to the difference of the meson energies in the @xmath56 process . here , since we have an incoming and an outgoing meson , the difference of energies is substituted by their sum . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the @xmath57 amplitude is written as , @xmath58 where @xmath59 mev and @xmath60 $ ] with @xmath61 @xcite , which incorporates a form factor to explicitly account for the exchange of a @xmath62 in the @xmath63channel .    the amplitude provided by the second lagrangian , eq . ( 7 ) , is @xmath64 with @xmath65 .    </S>",
    "<S> the strength of these two terms is similar and they interfere , but their relative phase is unknown . that phase is not relevant for the evaluation of the selfenergies in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite since there one studies the @xmath66 production where the meson pair comes in @xmath67wave and @xmath38wave from the lagrangians of eqs . ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) respectively .    hence , in the present reaction we must admit a quite large uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> there is a hint on which relative sign to take , based on the small upper bound for @xmath0 production in the preliminary results of k. imai et al.@xcite for the reaction @xmath68 on the proton . </S>",
    "<S> this small cross section could be qualitatively understood in base to a negative interference of the two terms that we have . for the case of @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> the sign of the amplitude for the vector lagrangian of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 6 ) is opposite to that of the @xmath68 reaction , while the amplitudes from eq . ( 7 ) do not change . </S>",
    "<S> based upon this , we take the positive relative sign between the amplitudes </S>",
    "<S> .    the wave functions of the @xmath0 are obtained by solving the schrdinger equation with two potentials , one with a strength @xmath69},\\ ] ] and the other one @xmath70}.\\ ] ] the calculated binding energies with these potentials are reported in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in this exploratory level , we only take into account a volume type potential and we have no @xmath71 splitting in the @xmath20 energy spectrum . as to the width , it was found in @xcite that assuming the free width to be 15 mev the width in the medium was smaller than 6 - 7 mev , due to pauli blocking effects mostly . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate the level widths using the imaginary part of the @xmath20 selfenergies calculated in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite at the appropriate @xmath20 energies .    with this range of values </S>",
    "<S> we intend to account for different uncertainties discussed in ref.@xcite , like the experimental uncertainties in the input used to fix the @xmath72 and @xmath73 couplings , uncertainties in the nucleon selfenergies , etc .    </S>",
    "<S> we show the calculated spectra for the formation of the @xmath0 bound states in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:12cv60 ] and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:12cv120 ] . </S>",
    "<S> we selected carbon as target since the level spacing of each subcomponent is expected to be comfortably large to observe the isolated peaks structure . </S>",
    "<S> the incident kinetic energy of the kaon beam is fixed at 300 mev to minimize the momentum transfer of the reaction .    </S>",
    "<S> the results with the shallow @xmath20 potential @xmath74 ( mev ) are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:12cv60 ] . </S>",
    "<S> we find three isolated peaks in the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the magnitude of the formation cross section is around a few [ @xmath75b / sr mev ] which is expected to be reachable in experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the results with the deep @xmath20 potential @xmath76 ( mev ) are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:12cv120 ] , where we find the separated peaks in the cross section again . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , we have six clear peaks in the spectrum according to the existence of more @xmath20 bound states due to the deeper potential . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of the cross section is around 10 times larger than with the shallow potential case because the width of the @xmath20 state is smaller for the deeper bound states which makes the peaks higher . </S>",
    "<S> the number of subcomponents of the spectrum is increased for the case of the deeper potential and we find again reasonably large cross section for the reaction . </S>",
    "<S> we should mention here that the real parts of the distortion potentials in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : distortion ] ) are relevant and make the cross sections larger by about a factor two for both @xmath20 potential cases .    in these calculated results , we have not included the quasi - free @xmath20 production , which will have certain contribution to the spectrum above the @xmath20 production threshold . </S>",
    "<S> the threshold is shown by the vertical lines in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:12cv60 ] and [ fig:12cv120 ] . the spectrum for @xmath77 below the threshold </S>",
    "<S> would be modified by the inclusion of the quasi - free @xmath20 processes . </S>",
    "<S> however , the spectrum in the bound @xmath20 region will not be affected by them .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> the results of @xcite indicate that there should be bound states of @xmath0 in nuclei , with separation energies reasonably larger than the width of the states . in view of that </S>",
    "<S> , we investigated the @xmath1 reaction to produce these states and obtained excitation spectra of @xmath0 states for a @xmath78c target with two different potentials which cover the likely range of the @xmath0 nucleus optical potential according to the calculations of @xcite . with the caveat about the uncertainties in the interference of the two terms discussed </S>",
    "<S> above , we obtain reasonable production rates in spite of the fact that the momentum transfer is not too small .    </S>",
    "<S> measurements of binding energies and partial decay widths in nuclei would provide precise information on the coupling of the @xmath0 to two meson channels and about the @xmath5 component in the @xmath0 wave function . </S>",
    "<S> the results obtained here should strongly encourage to do this experiment which could open the doors to the new field of @xmath0 hypernuclei . </S>"
