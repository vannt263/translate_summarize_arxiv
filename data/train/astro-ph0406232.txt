    "several recent papers have determined from an analysis of the data from the _ wmap _ satellite @xcite that the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) are asymmetrically distributed on the sky @xcite . in particular , it was shown @xcite that the power spectra as computed in the northern and southern hemispheres ( in both the galactic and ecliptic frames of reference ) differ significantly on large angular scales . specifically , for multipoles between 5 and 40 , the southern hemisphere spectrum showed evidence of excess power whereas the northern spectrum was remarkably lacking therein , with respect to the canonical full sky estimate .",
    "the asymmetry in the spectrum over these multipoles was found to be significant at the @xmath12 level compared to gaussian realizations of the best fit _",
    "wmap _ power spectrum .",
    "moreover , the axis of maximum asymmetry was found to have its north pole at @xmath13 ( galactic _ co_-latitude and longitude ) .",
    "this direction was subsequently confirmed by @xcite using tests of non - gaussianity . a similar ( albeit at lower statistical significance ) asymmetric distribution of power was also found using the data of the _ cobe_-dmr @xcite experiment .",
    "there have also been detections of non - gaussianity in the _ wmap _ data @xcite . whilst some of these have been claimed to be consistent with residual foreground signals @xcite",
    ", it remains uncertain whether this non - gaussianity is related to the power spectrum asymmetry . indeed , although indications of a possible foreground contamination of the quadrupole and octupole have been found ( i.e. @xcite ) ,",
    "the asymmetry at higher multipoles is harder to explain in terms of incorrectly subtracted foregrounds since it was found to be present at the same amplitude in all the _ wmap _ frequencies and does not seem to decrease significantly with an increasing galactic cut @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "the aim is not to obtain high - precision estimates of cosmological parameters in themselves , but rather to assess which parameters are more likely to be affected by the measured asymmetry and then to investigate and quantify the differences of the parameters between the north and the south .",
    "we will restrict the class of models for which we determine these parameterisations to the basic ( inflationary - scenario - inspired ) cosmological model as considered by the _ wmap _",
    "team @xcite  a flat @xmath14cdm model with power - law adiabatic primordial perturbations .",
    "the parameters of this model are the amplitude @xmath1 and the spectral index @xmath0 of the primordial power spectrum of scalar perturbations ( modelled as @xmath15 ) , the optical depth @xmath2 , the physical density of baryons and cold dark matter , @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 is the hubble constant in units of 100 km / s / mpc ) , and the cosmological constant @xmath19 .",
    "note that when fixing @xmath20 , the hubble constant @xmath18 is set when the parameters @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath19 are given .",
    "we determine estimates of these parameters in the northern and southern hemisphere in three reference frames : galactic , ecliptic and that frame which maximises the asymmetry in the power spectra computed in the corresponding hemispheres .",
    "in @xcite , the power spectrum was estimated on differently oriented hemispheres using the gabor transform formalism introduced by @xcite and extended in @xcite .",
    "a brief outline of the method is provided here .",
    "a gaussian likelihood ansatz is adopted with the pseudo power spectrum as input .",
    "the pseudo power spectrum @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 are the spherical harmonic coefficients on the observed sky .",
    "here , @xmath24 is the position on the sky , @xmath25 is the cmb temperature fluctuation amplitude at that position and @xmath26 is the mask .",
    "the latter quantity takes zero value in those parts of the sky which are either unobserved or have been excluded from the analysis , and is otherwise one .",
    "the likelihood can now be written as @xmath27 where the elements of the data vector are @xmath28 here , the first term is the observed pseudo power spectrum including noise and the second term is the expected signal pseudo spectrum as a function of the underlying full sky power spectrum @xmath29 .",
    "the last term contains the expected noise pseudo spectrum for the observed part of the sky .",
    "similarly , the matrix expressing the correlation between the pseudo power spectrum coefficients can be written as @xmath30 where there is one contribution from the signal ( s ) , one from the noise ( n ) and one from signal - noise mixing ( x ) .",
    "the exact form of these matrices , their dependence on the full sky power spectrum @xmath29 and details of their computation are discussed in @xcite . in these papers , the power spectrum was estimated by maximising this likelihood with respect to @xmath29 .",
    "as the likelihood is not gaussian with respect to the power spectrum , there is a small bias introduced in the estimate of the @xmath29 @xcite at the smallest multipoles , for which a correction was found in @xcite . in this paper , we maximise the likelihood with respect to the cosmological parameters .",
    "we have tested this method on simulated maps with known cosmological parameters and have demonstrated that the procedure gives an unbiased estimate of the input cosmological parameters .",
    "in this paper , we analyse the publicly available _ wmap _ data after correction for galactic foregrounds .",
    "we consider data from the v and w frequency bands only since these are less likely to be contaminated by residual foregrounds .",
    "the maps from the different channels are coadded using inverse noise - weighting @xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32 runs over the frequency channels v1,v2,w1,w2,w3,w4 .",
    "all analysis is performed using the _ wmap _ kp2 sky cut , including the point source mask .",
    "since we are interested in estimating the relative difference in parameters between the hemispheres rather than an exact evaluation of their values to high precision , the multipoles used in the analysis are limited to the ranges which are important for characterising the difference between the northern and the southern spectra .",
    "the asymmetry manifests itself as both a difference in shape over the first 40 multipoles and as a difference in amplitude between the low - order multipoles and those at higher @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , multipoles in the range @xmath34 are selected to account for the shape of the spectrum at large angular scales , together with a set of multipoles centred around the first two peaks ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) to constrain the shape of the spectrum at smaller scales .",
    "as noted in the introduction , we are generally interested in the parameters @xmath1 , @xmath0 , @xmath2 , @xmath16 , @xmath19 and @xmath37 , but have found that the asymmetry does not depend strongly on the exact value of the latter two values .",
    "this should not be surprising , since when @xmath38 is fixed , the parameters @xmath19 and @xmath37 influence the position of the acoustic peaks in the power spectrum , which does not differ significantly between the different hemispheres @xcite .",
    "consequently , it was decided for simplicity to fix these parameters to the best fit values found by the _",
    "wmap _ team ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) .",
    "these values are supported by independent astronomical observations that are consistent with the _ wmap _ findings ( for example , large scale structure matter distribution @xcite , hst key project , @xcite , type ia supernovae @xcite ) and that are not likely to be affected by the asymmetry .",
    "in addition , we have explicitly checked that the results in this paper are robust with respect to changes in these parameters .    for the analysis of the remaining four parameters , it was found that the adoption of a flat prior resulted in a poorly behaved likelihood surface , with a large number of false local maxima .",
    "this is a consequence of strong degeneracies between the parameters .",
    "however , by setting stronger priors on two of the parameters , these degeneracies were reduced and we were able to obtain estimates of the remaining two parameters .",
    "for the baryon fraction we adopted a gaussian prior with @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "this choice was motivated by observations of the primordial deuterium abundances which give values in the range @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "alternative gaussian priors centred at different values in this range and with different @xmath44 do not qualitatively affect the results presented below .",
    "finally , two sets of parameter estimates were computed :    * * gaussian prior on the spectral index @xmath0*. two different priors were assumed , one centred at @xmath3 corresponding to a flat harrison - zeldovich spectrum , the second at @xmath45 as suggested by the best fit _ wmap _",
    "spectral index , both with a dispersion @xmath46 .",
    "we found the results robust to changes in @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath1 were then estimated with a flat prior on these two parameters .",
    "the results of this procedure as applied to the 6 different hemispheres are shown in table ( [ tab : prin ] ) and ( [ tab : prin2 ] ) and figure ( [ fig : plotn ] ) . *",
    "* gaussian prior on the optical depth @xmath2*. again two priors were adopted , one centred at @xmath4 and one centred at the _ wmap _ best fit value @xmath9 , both with @xmath47 .",
    "the qualitative results and conclusions were found not to change significantly under changes in @xmath44 .",
    "the results of the parameter estimation procedure on the 6 different hemispheres are shown in tables ( [ tab : prit ] ) and ( [ tab : prit2 ] ) and figure ( [ fig : plott ] ) .",
    "the estimated parameters given in the tables are found in the following way :    1 .   for a given parameter",
    ", we found the marginalized likelihood by integrating over all other parameters .",
    "the best fit value quoted in the tables is the value which maximises the marginalized likelihood .",
    "this value was found to be consistent with the value which maximises the full likelihood also given in the tables .",
    "the @xmath48 and @xmath8 ranges given in the tables are those for which the integrated marginalized likelihood is @xmath7 and @xmath49 of the total integral respectively .",
    "note that because of degeneracies between parameters , some of these error bars are asymmetric . forcing a stronger prior ( lower @xmath44 ) on the other parameters , the error bars become more symmetric .    .",
    "the figures were created with following procedure :    1 .   for each possible pair of two parameters we determined the likelihood marginalized over the remaining parameters",
    "the contours shown in the plot are the areas for which the integral of the two dimensional marginalized likelihood is less than @xmath7 of the total .",
    "the shaded zone shows the full sky results , the zones filled with horizontal lines with a dashed border show the results on the northern hemisphere and the zones filled with vertical lines with dotted borders show the results on the southern hemisphere .",
    "the position of the maximum of this two - dimensional likelihood is shown as a filled square ( full sky ) , open square ( northern hemisphere ) and cross ( southern hemisphere ) .",
    "the most striking feature in these tables is the fact that when assuming a harrison - zeldovich spectrum with a spectral index close to one , the optical depth in the south is found to be @xmath50 whereas the most likely optical depth in the north is consistent with zero .",
    "this holds for all three frames of reference .",
    "if instead we use a flat prior on @xmath0 and put a gaussian prior on @xmath2 , the value of the spectral index becomes significantly different in the northern and the southern hemispheres with a larger value in the south , the exact value depending on where the prior on @xmath2 is centred .",
    "note further that , for the full sky , the estimate of the optical depth ( @xmath51 assuming a spectral index close to 1 ) determined from the marginalized likelihood is close to the value found by the _ wmap _",
    "team , despite the fact that the _ wmap _ results were derived additionally using polarisation data which is more sensitive to the optical depth than the pure temperature data used here",
    ". it should be noted , however , that as a consequence of strong degeneracies , the marginalized likelihood in @xmath2 is very flat and the maximum at @xmath51 is not a very peaked maximum .",
    "this is also seen in figure [ fig : plotn ] where the @xmath48 contour is very extended in the @xmath2 direction .",
    "this also explains why there is such a large difference between the estimated value of @xmath51 using the marginalized likelihood and the estimate of @xmath4 using the full likelihood as seen in table ( [ tab : prin ] ) . as will be discussed below , when excluding the very first multipoles the preferred value of @xmath2 on the full sky increases .",
    "we will now outline how the results obtained above can be understood qualitatively by considering the manner in which the parameters of interest , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath0 influence the shape of the spectrum .",
    "first , we will consider the case when @xmath0 is fixed and discuss the variation of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the optical depth @xmath2 attenuates the amplitude of the higher multipoles ( from @xmath52 and above ) by a factor of roughly @xmath53 . the amplitude and the optical depth can not then be estimated separately over this range , so an effective resulting amplitude is written as @xmath54 .",
    "we know that the power spectra on these scales are consistent between the different hemispheres , and therefore the estimates of @xmath1 and @xmath2 should lie close to the line @xmath55 in the @xmath56 diagram , as is indeed seen in figure ( [ fig : plotn ] ) . in order to break this degeneracy , the shape and amplitude of the lower order multipoles",
    "are needed , since the optical depth has only a small influence on the amplitudes in this range .",
    "therefore , when fixing the spectrum at higher multipoles , a greater amplitude for the low multipoles with respect to the higher ones yields a higher optical depth and vice versa . in @xcite , it was shown that the amplitude of the spectrum for the low multipoles ( @xmath57 ) is higher in the south than in the north , one could thus expect a higher value of @xmath2 in the south .",
    "this is exactly what we have seen in tables ( [ tab : prin]-[tab : prin2 ] ) and in figure ( [ fig : plotn ] ) .",
    "now we consider the shape of the spectrum in the first multipoles , where a strong degeneracy between @xmath2 and @xmath0 manifests itself .",
    "specifically , when the optical depth is increased , the shape of the spectrum is tilted in such a way that the lowest @xmath33 part of the spectrum is raised with respect to the rest of the low @xmath33 plateau . lowering the spectral index @xmath0 results in similar behaviour . as shown in @xcite , the southern spectra",
    "have this tilt favouring either lower @xmath0 or higher @xmath2 values .",
    "both of these effects are seen in the results presented here  the estimates of @xmath2 with a prior centred at @xmath45 are lower than the corresponding values determined with the prior centred at @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , the estimates of the spectral index @xmath0 are higher when the prior on @xmath2 is centred at @xmath9 than when centred at @xmath4 .    in order to understand the significance of the results further",
    ", 512 simulations were generated with the effective beam and noise of the co - added w+v channel , and with the input power spectrum specified by the _ wmap _ best fit full sky parameters for a power law index . from these maps , it was determined that @xmath58 showed evidence for a difference in @xmath2 between the northern and southern hemispheres ( defined in the maximum asymmetry reference frame of the _ wmap _ data ) as large as that observed here . however , only one of these 512 maps had a difference in the power spectrum comparable to that in the _ wmap _ data .",
    "we then considered the subset of simulated maps which had , relative to the _ wmap _ results , a larger difference in @xmath2 but smaller difference in power spectra between the northern and the southern hemispheres .",
    "in most cases , the large differences in @xmath2 were due to a high value in one hemisphere driven by a strong upward fluctuation in a few multipoles .",
    "this is qualitatively different from the _ wmap _ behaviour , in which the spectrum on one of the hemispheres is _ systematically _ higher over a large range of @xmath33 .",
    "finally , we note that @xcite found some evidence for possible residual galactic foreground contamination in the multipole range @xmath59 . therefore , the parameters of interest in this work were re - evaluated after excluding the multipoles @xmath10 ( this range was appropriate because of the binning used in this analysis ) .",
    "there has been considerable debate in the literature as to whether this multipole range is of abnormally low amplitude relative to the rest of the spectrum ( and more particularly relative to the claimed best fit cosmological model ) .",
    "we do not add to this discussion here , but recall that such behaviour favours a lower value of @xmath2 or spectral index @xmath0 , so that on exclusion of these low-@xmath33 multipoles the preferred value of @xmath2 and @xmath0 should increase .",
    "this is indeed what is observed .",
    "however , the significance of the asymmetry and the difference in parameters between the north and the south change only slightly and the results are not reported here .",
    ".estimated parameters with a prior on @xmath0 centred at @xmath60 [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "previous work has determined the presence of a significant asymmetric distribution of large scale power in the _ wmap _ data . such a result could be suggestive of incompletely understood foreground residuals or systematic artifacts , interesting physical effects taking place at post - recombination , or a more profound lack of the correct cosmological framework within which to understand the data . in an attempt to gain further insight ,",
    "we have investigated the influence of the asymmetry on the inferred values of specific cosmological parameters computed in the northern and southern hemispheres of three frames of reference  the galactic , the ecliptic and the frame of reference which maximises the observed asymmetry of the power spectrum .",
    "it was determined that the parameters which are sensitive to variations in the shape of the power spectrum seen in the different hemispheres are : the amplitude of fluctuations @xmath1 , the spectral index @xmath0 and the optical depth @xmath2 .",
    "however , significant degeneracies between the parameters were present , and in detailed work we elected to place prior constraints one one parameter , then consider the behaviour of the remaining two .    after placing a gaussian prior on @xmath0 centred at @xmath3 with @xmath46 , we found that the optical depth in the northern hemisphere was small ( @xmath5 at @xmath48 confidence in the maximally asymmetric frame of reference ) , whereas in the south the values were of order @xmath61 , inconsistent with @xmath4 at the @xmath8 level .",
    "therefore , it seems possible that the main contribution to the optical depth @xmath9 estimated on the full sky by the _ wmap _",
    "team ( and independently re - estimated here to be @xmath51 ) comes from the southern hemisphere .",
    "the _ wmap _",
    "value for the optical depth also includes information from the temperature - polarisation , @xmath62 , cross - power spectrum .",
    "a crucial test of our hypothesis is then to make a similar hemisphere - partitioned analysis of the polarised signal .",
    "a varying optical depth in different directions might occur if the reionization of the universe were highly inhomogeneous , but it is not clear how to produce such a scenario . an alternate possibility might arise from the presence of a huge gas mass in the southern hemisphere .",
    "this possibility was also discussed by @xcite in the context of a strong non - gaussian cold spot located in this region . however , the asymmetry in the spectrum remained even when this spot were masked out .",
    "moreover , to explain such a huge difference in @xmath2 , an enormous amount of gas distributed over a huge area would be required : assuming that a cluster of galaxies may have an optical depth of order @xmath63 implies that the gas required to produce an amplitude of @xmath61 would correspond to the content of several clusters along the line of sight in all directions on the southern hemisphere .",
    "if on the other hand , one assumes that the _ wmap _ data are contaminated by some unknown source , then the surprisingly high value of @xmath64 might be taken as an indication that the southern hemisphere is suspect .",
    "further , the estimate of the amplitude of fluctuations @xmath1 and the optical depth @xmath2 using only the temperature power spectrum , are highly correlated and closely follow the line @xmath55 .",
    "consequently , a low estimate of @xmath2 implies a low estimate of @xmath1 , and vice versa . in the north where the optical depth is low ,",
    "the amplitude is also found to be low ( @xmath65 ) whereas in the south the amplitude is found to be significantly higher @xmath66 .",
    "as outlined in @xcite , some weak lensing experiments and studies using galaxy velocity fields find values of the amplitude consistent with our northern hemisphere findings .",
    "this is also the case for a recent estimate of the amplitude using the cluster mass function obtained from the baryon mass of clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , other experiments such as studies of high redshift clusters and measurements of the sz effect through the high @xmath33 tail of the cmb power spectrum ( again see @xcite as well as a recent paper by @xcite ) indicate a higher value for the amplitude , consistent with our estimate on the southern hemisphere .    alternatively , if we put a gaussian prior on @xmath2 and adopt a flat prior on the spectral index , we find that the spectral index determined in the northern hemisphere is systematically higher than in the southern hemisphere , where the exact value depends on where the prior for @xmath2 is centred . for a low value of @xmath2 , we estimate low values inconsistent with @xmath3 in the southern hemisphere .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath9 we find high values inconsistent with @xmath3 in the northern hemisphere .",
    "if we consider that this behaviour is an indication that one of the hemispheres contains some unknown contamination , one can not use this result to draw a conclusion about its location .",
    "finally , we note that should the asymmetry remain unexplained in terms of residual or unknown foreground contamination or systematic artifacts , the possibility remains that it may be necessary to invoke new post - recombination physical processes or to accept that our current conceptual framework based on the principle of cosmological isotropy and inflationary - scenario - inspired models is inadequate .",
    "we await the release of the _ wmap _ 2-year results , and particularly the polarisation information , to further test these possibilities .",
