    "topological insulators ( superconductors ) are gapped phases of non - interacting fermions which exhibit topologically protected boundary modes .",
    "these boundary states are gapless , with extended wavefunctions , and protected against arbitrary deformations ( or perturbations ) of the hamiltonian , as long as the generic symmetries ( such as e.g.  time - reversal symmetry ) of the hamiltonian are preserved and the bulk gap is not closed .",
    "the different phases within a given topological insulator ( superconductor ) are characterized by a topological invariant , which is either an integer chern / winding number or a @xmath1 quantity . the integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe )",
    "is the best known example of such a phase . in the iqhe , the transverse ( hall )",
    "electrical conductance @xmath7 carried by edge states is quantized and proportional to the topologically invariant chern number @xcite appears in the scaling of the entanglement entropy ( and the entanglement entropy spectrum ) @xcite . ] . as a consequence of the quantization of the hall conductance @xmath7 ,",
    "two different quantum hall states with different values of @xmath7 can not be adiabatically connected without closing the energy gap in the bulk .",
    "therefore they represent distinct `` topologically ordered '' phases that are separated by a quantum phase transition ( figure  [ top_insulators]a ) .",
    "other examples of gapped topological phases are the ( spinless ) chiral @xmath8 superconductor @xcite , which breaks time - reversal symmetry ( @xmath9 ) , and the quantum spin hall ( qsh ) states @xcite , which are time - reversal invariant . in the former case , the topological features in question are those of the fermionic quasiparticle excitations deep in the superconducting phase , whose dynamics is described by the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) hamiltonian .",
    "the bdg hamiltonian of any superconductor has , by construction , a `` built - in '' charge - conjugation ( or : particle - hole ) symmetry ( @xmath10 ) . in analogy to the iqhe , the different topological phases of the @xmath8 superconductor can be labeled by an integer ( @xmath11 ) topological invariant @xcite .",
    "the corresponding quantized conductance is the transverse ( hall ) thermal , or `` leduc - righi '' conductance ( divided by temperature ) .",
    "the quantum spin hall effect ( qshe ) , on the other hand , which occurs in two - dimensional and three - dimensional time - reversal invariant insulators , is characterized by a @xmath1 topological number @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this binary quantity distinguishes the non - trivial state ( @xmath13 ) , whose boundary modes consist of an odd number of dirac fermion modes ( i.e. , odd number of kramers pairs ) , from the trivial state ( @xmath14 ) , which is characterized by an even number of kramers pairs of boundary ( surface or edge ) states ( figure  [ top_insulators]b ) .",
    "a physical realization of the qshe was theoretically predicted @xcite and experimentally observed @xcite in hgte/(hg , ce)te semiconductor quantum wells .",
    "subsequently , based both on theoretical considerations @xcite and experimental measurements @xcite , the three - dimensional @xmath1 topological insulator phase was shown to occur in bismuth - related materials , such as bisb alloys , bi@xmath15se@xmath16 and bi@xmath15te@xmath16 .    the key difference among the iqhe , the qshe and three - dimensional @xmath1 topological insulator , and the chiral @xmath17 superconductor lies in their generic symmetry properties ( to be discussed in more detail below ) .",
    "all these states are topological in the sense that they can not be continuously deformed into a trivial insulating state ( i.e. , a state without any gapless boundary modes ) while keeping the generic symmetries of the system intact and without closing the bulk energy gap .",
    "the key property of the qsh states , for example , is the spin - orbit interaction in combination with time - reversal symmetry ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the latter protects the boundary states from acquiring a gap or becoming localized in the presence of disorder (= terms added to the hamiltonian which break translational symmetry ) .",
    "the chiral @xmath17 superconductor , on the other hand , is characterized by @xmath10 but the lack of @xmath9 .",
    "classification and ( b ) @xmath1 classification . ]",
    "the aforementioned examples of `` symmetry protected '' topological states are part of a larger scheme was given in ref .",
    "@xcite . a systematic regularity ( periodicity ) of the classification as the dimensionality is varied",
    "was discovered by kitaev in ref .",
    "@xcite for all dimensions through the use of k - theory . a certain systematic pattern as the dimensionality is varied was discovered for some of the topological insulators by qi , hughes and zhang in ref .",
    "@xcite using a chern - simons action in extended space .",
    "below we will use a version of the ideas of `` dimensional reduction '' employed in ref .",
    "@xcite . ] that fully classifies @xcite all topological insulators ( superconductors ) in terms of symmetry and spatial dimension .",
    "this classification scheme is summarized in table  [ periodic table ] .",
    "the first column in this table provides the complete list of all possible `` symmetry classes '' of single - particle hamiltonians .",
    "there are precisely ten such `` symmetry classes '' , a fundamental result due to zirnbauer , and altland and zirnbauer @xcite .",
    "these authors recognized that there is a one - to - one correspondence between single - particle hamiltonians and the set of ( `` large '' ) symmetric spaces , of which there are precisely ten , a classic result obtained in 1926 by the mathematician lie cartan .",
    "the work of altland and zirnbauer extends , indeed completes , the much earlier work by wigner and dyson most well known from the context of random matrix theory as the three `` unitary , orthogonal , and symplectic '' symmetry classes @xcite . before discussing in more detail the result of the classification in table  [ periodic table ] , we will first briefly explain the notion of `` symmetry class '' and the ten - fold list of hamiltonians , which is the framework within which the classification scheme in table  [ periodic table ] is formulated .",
    "the reader familiar with this topic may skip this subsection .",
    "consider the gapped first - quantized hamiltonian describing the topological insulator ( superconductor ) in the bulk ( @xmath2 spatial dimensions ) .",
    "the topological features of this hamiltonian , which we are interested in characterizing , are ( by definition ) not changed if we modify ( deform ) the hamiltonian by adding terms ( or perturbations ) to it which break any translational symmetry that may be present .",
    "thus the topological features must be properties of a translationally _ not _ invariant hamiltonian . seeking a classification scheme",
    ", one must have some framework within which to classify such translationally _ not _ invariant hamiltonians .",
    "such a classification can not involve the notion of ordinary symmetries , i.e. , of _ unitary _ operators which commute with the hamiltonian .",
    "consider , e.g. , ( pauli- ) spin rotation symmetry , ubiquitous in condensed matter systems .",
    "the notion of spin - rotation invariance can be eliminated by writing the hamiltonian in block form , and by focussing attention on a block of the hamiltonian .",
    "such a block decomposition can be performed for any symmetry which commutes with the hamiltonian .",
    "the notion of `` symmetry classes '' mentioned above refers to the properties of these blocks of symmetry - less `` irreducible '' hamiltonians :",
    "as it turns out , there are only ten of them .",
    "the basic idea why this is the case is simple to understand .",
    "the only properties that the blocks can satisfy are certain reality conditions that follow from the `` extremely generic symmetries '' of time - reversal and charge - conjugation ( or : particle - hole symmetry ) . these are not symmetries in the above sense , since they are both represented by _ anti-_unitary operators , when acting on the single - particle hilbert space . specifically , consider a general system of non - interacting fermions described by a `` second - quantized '' hamiltonian @xmath18 .",
    "for a non - superconducting system , e.g. , this reads @xmath19 with fermion creation and annihilation operators satisfying canonical anti - commutation relations @xmath20 here we imagine for convenience of notation that we have `` regularized '' the system on a lattice , and @xmath21 are combined labels for the lattice sites @xmath22 , and if relevant , of additional quantum numbers such as e.g. , a pauli - spin quantum number ( e.g. , @xmath23 with @xmath24 ) .",
    "then @xmath25 is an @xmath26 matrix , the `` first quantized '' hamiltonian .",
    "( similarly , a superconducting system is described by a bdg hamiltonian for which we use the nambu - spinor instead of complex fermion operators @xmath27 and whose first quantized form is again a matrix @xmath28 when discretized on a lattice . )    now , time reversal symmetry can be expressed in terms of @xmath28 : the system is invariant under time reversal symmetry if and only if the complex conjugate of the first quantized hamiltonian @xmath29 is equal to @xmath28 up to a unitary rotation @xmath30 , i.e. @xmath31 moreover , the system is invariant under charge - conjugation ( or : particle - hole ) symmetry if and only if the complex conjugate of the hamiltonian @xmath32 is equal to _ minus _",
    "@xmath28 up to a unitary rotation @xmath33 , i.e. @xmath34 ( this property may be less familiar , but it is easy to check  @xcite that it is a characterization of charge - conjugation ( particle - hole ) symmetry for non - interacting systems of fermions ) . a look at equations ( [ deftimereversal],[defchargeconjugation ] )",
    "reveals that @xmath9 and @xmath10 , when acting on the single particle hilbert space , are not unitary symmetries , but rather reality conditions on the hamiltonian @xmath28 _ modulo _ unitary rotations . ]",
    "while the particle - hole transformation is unitary , the time - reversal operation is anti - unitary , @xmath35 .",
    "the system is time - reversal invariant ( particle - hole symmetric ) , if and only if @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "this leads directly to the conditions ( [ deftimereversal ] ) and ( [ defchargeconjugation ] ) for the first quantized hamiltonian . note that @xmath36 implies @xmath38 .",
    "iterating @xmath9 and @xmath10 twice , one obtains @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "when acting on the first quantized hamiltonian this reads @xmath41@xmath42 and @xmath43@xmath42 , respectively .",
    "the first quantized hamiltonians @xmath28 are seen ( below ) to run over an irreducible representation space , and thus @xmath44 and @xmath45 are both multiples of the identity matrix @xmath46 ( by schur s lemma ) .",
    "since @xmath30 and @xmath47 are unitary matrices , there are only two possibilities for each , i.e. , @xmath48 and @xmath49 . the time - reversal operation @xmath9 and the particle - hole transformation @xmath10 can then each square to plus or to minus the identity , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 . ] and a _ single _ charge - conjugation operator @xmath10 . if the ( first quantized ) hamiltonian @xmath28 was invariant under , say , _ two _ charge - conjugation operations @xmath52 and @xmath53 , then the composition @xmath54 of these two symmetry operations would be a _",
    "unitary _ symmetry when acting on the first quantized hamiltonian @xmath28 , i.e. , the product @xmath55 would _ commute _ with @xmath28 . by bringing the hamiltonian @xmath28 in block form",
    ", @xmath55 would then be constant on each block .",
    "thus , on each block @xmath56 and @xmath57 would then be trivially related to each other , and it would suffice to consider one of the two charge conjugation operations .",
    " on the other hand , note that the product @xmath58 corresponds to a _",
    "unitary _ symmetry operation when acting on the first quantized hamiltonian @xmath28 .",
    "but in this case the unitary matrix @xmath59 does not commute but _ anti-_commutes with @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , @xmath58 does not correspond to an an `` ordinary '' symmetry of @xmath28 .",
    "it is for this reason that we need to consider the product @xmath58 ( called `` chiral '' , or `` sublattice '' symmetry @xmath60 below ) as an additional essential ingredient for the classification of the blocks , besides time - reversal @xmath9 and charge - conjugation ( particle - hole ) symmetries @xmath10 . ]",
    "now it is easy to see that there are only ten possible ways for a system to respond to time - reversal and charge - conjugation ( particle - hole symmetry ) operations . as for time - reversal symmetry ( @xmath9 )",
    ", the hamiltonian can either be ( i ) : not time - reversal invariant , in which case we write @xmath61 , or ( ii ) : it may be time - reversal invariant and the anti - unitary time - reversal symmetry operator @xmath9 squares to plus the identity operator , in which case we write @xmath62 , or ( iii ) : it may be time - reversal invariant and the anti - unitary time - reversal symmetry operator @xmath9 squares to minus the identity , in which case we write @xmath63 .",
    "similarly , there are three possible ways for the hamiltonian @xmath28 to respond to charge - conjugation ( particle - hole symmetry ) @xmath10 ( again , @xmath10 may square to plus or minus the identity operator ) .",
    "for these three possibilities we write @xmath64 .",
    "hence , there are @xmath65 possible ways for a hamiltonian @xmath28 to respond to time - reversal and charge - conjugation ( particle - hole transformation ) .",
    "these are not yet all ten cases because it is also necessary to consider the behavior of the hamiltonian under the product @xmath66 which is a unitary operation .",
    "a moment s thought ( see table  [ tablesymmetryclassestwo ] ) shows that for 8 of the 9 possibilities the behavior of the hamiltonian under the product @xmath66 is uniquely fixed .",
    "is sometimes called `` sublattice symmetry '' , hence the notation @xmath60 . however , in many instances @xmath60 is not realized as a sublattice symmetry , but is just simply the product of @xmath9 and @xmath10 . therefore the term `` chiral symmetry '' to describe the symmetry operation @xmath60 is sometimes more appropriate . ]",
    "( we write @xmath67 if the operation @xmath60 is not a symmetry of the hamiltonian , and @xmath68 if it is . )",
    "the only case when the behavior under the combined transformation @xmath69 is not determined by the behavior under @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the case where @xmath61 and @xmath70 . in this case",
    "either @xmath67 or @xmath68 is possible .",
    "this then yields @xmath71 possible behaviors of the hamiltonian .",
    "the list of ten possible behaviors of the first quantized hamiltonian under @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath60 is listed in table  [ tablesymmetryclassestwo ] .",
    "these are the ten generic symmetry classes ( the `` ten - fold way '' ) which are the framework within which the classification scheme of topological insulators ( superconductors ) is formulated .",
    "let us first point out a very general structure seen in table  [ tablesymmetryclassestwo ] .",
    "this is listed in the column entitled `` hamiltonian '' .",
    "when the first quantized hamiltonian @xmath28 is `` regularized '' ( or : `` put on '' ) a finite lattice , it becomes an @xmath72 matrix ( as discussed above ) .",
    "the entries in the column `` hamiltonian '' specify the type of @xmath26 matrix that the quantum mechanical time - evolution operator @xmath73 is .",
    "for example , for systems which have no time - reversal or charge - conjugation symmetry properties at all , i.e. , for which @xmath61 , @xmath70 , @xmath67 , which are listed in the first row of the table , there are no constraints on the hamiltonian except for hermiticity .",
    "thus @xmath28 is a generic hermitian matrix and the time - evolution operator is a generic unitary matrix , so that @xmath73 is an element of the unitary group @xmath74 of unitary @xmath72 matrices . by imposing time - reversal symmetry ( for a system that has , e.g. , no other degree of freedom such as , e.g. , spin ) , there exists a basis in which @xmath28 is represented by a real symmetric @xmath72 matrix .",
    "this , in turn , can be expressed as saying that the time - evolution operator is an element of the coset of groups , @xmath75 .",
    "all other entries of the column `` hamiltonian '' can be obtained from analogous considerations . with @xmath76",
    "are tight - binding models on bipartite graphs whose two ( disjoint ) subgraphs contain @xmath4 and @xmath77 lattice sites . ]",
    "what is interesting about this column is that its entries run precisely over what is known as the complete set of ten ( `` large '' ) symmetric spaces , classified in 1926 in fundamental work by the mathematician lie cartan .",
    "thus , as the first quantized hamiltonian runs over all ten possible symmetry classes , the corresponding quantum mechanical time - evolution operator runs over all ten symmetric spaces .",
    "thus , the appearance of the cartan symmetric spaces is a reflection of fundamental aspects of ( single - particle ) quantum mechanics .",
    "we will discuss the last column entitled `` @xmath78 ( ferm .",
    "nl@xmath79 m ) '' in the following subsection .    .",
    "[ tablesymmetryclassestwo ] listed are the ten generic symmetry classes of single - particle hamiltonians @xmath28 , classified according to their behavior under time - reversal symmetry ( @xmath9 ) , charge - conjugation ( or : particle - hole ) symmetry ( @xmath10 ) , as well as `` sublattice '' ( or : `` chiral '' ) symmetry ( @xmath60 ) .",

    "a diagnostics of bulk topological character is the existence of gapless edge modes . for insulators and superconductors with an inversion symmetry , it is less clear if looking for edge modes is useful to characterize the bulk topological character since boundary breaks inversion symmetry .",
