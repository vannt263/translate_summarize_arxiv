    "if in such a system the _ classical _ dynamics is chaotic and the unit cells are connected , then globally this leads to a diffusive spreading of trajectories , irrespective of the presence or absence of static disorder . regular motion on tori does not contribute to diffusive spreading : closed tori do not allow for transport along the lattice , while open tori give rise to ballistic spreading .",
    "the spectral and transport properties of extended _ quantum _ systems , in contrast , depend sensitively on the degree of translational symmetry . on short time",
    "scales , however , where the quantum dynamics still closely follows the classical , both periodic and disordered quantum systems exhibit ( apart from an initial ballistic phase which is of no interest for the following ) a spreading of wavepackets with the characteristics of the chaotic diffusion in their classical counterparts .",
    "the signature of this phase in the discrete spectra of disordered systems with anderson - localized eigenstates has been investigated previously @xcite , using techniques in the spirit of berry s semiclassical derivation @xcite of the spectral form factors for the canonical random - matrix ensembles .    in the present work",

    ", we evaluate this relation over the entire time evolution of the form factors . in the semiclassical regime",
    ", we show that the full space and time dependence of the classical propagator is contained in the form factors .",
    "chaotic diffusion in spatially periodic quantum systems can thus directly be identified in the band structure .",
    "similarly , the spectral signature of the crossover to quantum ballistic motion can be analyzed on basis of the full quantum propagator . in the limit of a large number of unit cells , the form factors",
