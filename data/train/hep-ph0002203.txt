    "the present best bound on the tau lepton magnetic moment ( @xmath6 ) is indirect @xcite .",
    "it comes from the observation that in general extensions of the standard model ( sm ) it is very difficult to generate a magnetic moment for a lepton without originating a coupling of the z boson to the lepton of the same order of magnitude .",
    "this anomalous z coupling ( @xmath7 ) is strongly bounded by lep1 , therefore , by assuming that the magnetic moment of the lepton ( @xmath6 ) has the same size , one obtains a rather strong bound on it .",
    "while this argument is plausible , the complete amount of data coming from tau - lepton production at lep1 , sld and lep2 , and data on w decays into tau leptons from lep2 and @xmath0 colliders , allows for a more complete analysis of the magnetic moment couplings of the tau to the photon , the z and the w bosons .    following ref .",
    "@xcite , in order to analyze tau magnetic moments , we will use an effective lagrangian description@xcite .",
    "thus , in section [ sec : el ] we describe the effective lagrangian we use and fix the notation .",
    "lep1 and sld are sensitive only to the z - magnetic moments , however lep2 is sensitive to both z- and photon- magnetic moments . far from the resonance statistics decreases dramatically and the precision is not as good as the precision obtained at lep1 .",
    "however , since magnetic moment couplings are non - renormalizable couplings , their effects grow with energy and , therefore , lep2 limits can still be relevant .",
    "this is especially true for electromagnetic couplings for which lep1 does not give much information .",
    "that is also the reason why experiments performed at lower energies do not provide , in general , stringent bounds ( see for instance the bounds obtained from tau decays @xcite ) . to obtain relevant bounds at lower energies the suppression factor , @xmath8 , has to be compensated by higher precision in the experiment .",
    "tau magnetic moment contributions to tau production in lep1-sld and lep2 are studied in section [ sec : tauprod ] . in this respect",
    "we can classify the observables in three classes : i ) universality test at lep1 , which are studied in [ sec : lep1 ] , ii ) total production rates at lep2 , considered in [ sec : lep2 ] , and iii ) transverse polarization asymmetries , studied in [ sec : pol ] .",
    "tau magnetic moments flip chirality and in the standard model the only source of chirality flips are fermion masses .",
    "this means that any contribution of magnetic moments ( weak or electromagnetic ) to total rates are either suppressed by the fermion mass ( relative to the electroweak scale ) or need two operator insertions and then , they come as the square of the magnetic moments .",
    "in addition any new physics , not only that related with magnetic moments , will appear in total rates .",
    "hence , in order to study magnetic moments it is interesting to look for observables that are exactly zero when chirality is conserved .",
    "those observables will only be sensitive to fermion masses and to magnetic moments .",
    "in addition they will only depend linearly on magnetic moments .",
    "some transverse tau polarization asymmetries @xcite are observables of this type and they have been already measured at lep1 @xcite and sld @xcite .",
    "we will show in subsection [ sec : pol ] that they already give now the best and cleanest bounds on tau magnetic moments",
    ". it would be interesting to study these observables also at lep2 to disentangle weak an electromagnetic magnetic moments .",
    "gauge invariance , after the spontaneous symmetry breaking , relates the magnetic moments of the z , the photon , and the w gauge bosons .",
    "therefore one can also gain some insight on tau magnetic moments by studying w decays into tau leptons .",
    "there are already rather good bounds on the universality of the leptonic decays of the w coming from lep2 , ua1 , ua2 , cdf and d0 , those are studied in section [ sec : wdec ] . in section [ sec :",
    "limits ] we combine all bounds and obtain the best limits on the different magnetic moment couplings . finally in section",
    "[ sec : conc ] we discuss the obtained results and compare with other bounds found in the literature .",
    "the standard model gives a very good description of all physics at energies available at present accelerators .",
    "therefore , one expects that any deviation from the standard model , at present energies , can be parametrized by an effective lagrangian built with the standard model particle spectrum , having as zero order term just the standard model lagrangian , and containing higher dimension gauge invariant operators suppressed by the scale of new physics @xmath9 .",
    "the leading non - standard effects will come from the operators with the lowest dimension .",
    "those are dimension six operators .",
    "there are only two operators of this type contributing to the tau magnetic moments : @xmath10 and @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the tau leptonic doublet , @xmath13 is the higgs doublet , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the u(1)@xmath16 and su(2)@xmath17 field strength tensors , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the gauge couplings .    in principle , one could also write dimension six operators like @xmath20 with @xmath21 . however , these operators reduce to the operator eq .  ( [ eq : ob ] ) after using the standard model equations of motion . in doing so , the couplings will be proportional to the tau - lepton yukawa couplings .",
    "note that operators in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ob ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : ow ] ) break chirality while the operator eq .",
    "( [ eq : oderiv ] ) does not break it .",
    "therefore , by using this last form we would implicitly assume that the only source of chirality breaking are yukawa couplings and that any chirality breaking , including magnetic moments , should be proportional to fermion masses . in order to be more general",
    "we will assume the forms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ob ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : ow ] ) , having in mind that we are introducing in the standard model an additional source of chirality breaking in addition to fermion masses . as we will see in the next sections this will become very important in looking for the right observables sensitive to magnetic moments .",
    "thus , we write our effective lagrangian as , @xmath22 where , for simplicity , we will take the couplings @xmath23 and @xmath24 real .",
    "note that complex couplings will break @xmath25 conservation and lead to electric dipole moments .",
    "if these operators come from a renormalizable theory , in the perturbative regime one expects , in general , that they arise only at one loop and therefore their contribution will be further suppressed .",
    "however , this does not need to be the case , therefore we leave the couplings @xmath23 and @xmath24 as free parameters without any further assumption .",
    "after spontaneous symmetry breaking , the higgs gets a vacuum expectation value @xmath26 with @xmath27  gev , and the interactions ( [ eq : interaccio ] ) can be written in terms of the gauge boson mass eigenstates , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , using that @xmath30 where , as usual , we define @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 . thus , our lagrangian , written in terms of the mass eigenstates , is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the electromagnetic field strength tensor , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the corresponding strength tensors for the @xmath39 and @xmath40 gauge bosons .",
    "we have not written the non - abelian couplings involving more than one gauge boson because they are not relevant to our purposes .",
    "we have normalized all couplings to @xmath41 , the natural mass - scale at the energies we will consider , and we have defined the following dimensionless couplings @xmath42 the lagrangian ( [ eq : leff_fin ] ) gives additional contributions to the electromagnetic moment of the tau , which usually is expressed in terms of the parameter @xmath6 .",
    "similar parameters have been introduced in the literature for the corresponding weak magnetic moments for the @xmath39-boson , @xmath7 @xcite and the @xmath40-boson , @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "they can be expressed in terms of our @xmath44 s as follows , @xmath45 notice that , in the effective lagrangian approach , exactly the same couplings that contribute to processes at high energies also contribute to the magnetic moment form factors , @xmath46 , at @xmath47 .",
    "the difference @xmath48 only comes from higher dimension operators whose effect is suppressed by powers of @xmath49 , as long as @xmath50 as needed for the consistence of the effective lagrangian approach .    in ( [ eq : leff_fin ] ) we have all type of magnetic moment couplings except neutrino - neutrino couplings .",
    "this is due to the fact that we have not included right - handed neutrinos , @xmath51 , in the particle spectrum .",
    "if we include them we can add two additional operators that will give magnetic moment couplings of the neutrinos to the z , and additional contributions to the @xmath52 magnetic moment couplings .",
    "however they will also give rise to an electromagnetic moment for the neutrinos which is extremely well bounded from a variety of sources , energy loss in red giants , supernova cooling , etc .",
    ", so we are not going to consider them in our calculation .",
    "since the effect of the operators in ( [ eq : leff_fin ] ) is suppressed at low energies the most interesting bounds will come from the highest precision experiments at the highest available energies . presently this means lep1 and sld ( @xmath39 decay rates and polarization asymmetries ) , lep2 ( cross sections and @xmath40 decays rates ) , cdf and d0 ( @xmath40 decay rates ) .",
    "consequently in the following we will study all those observables .",
    "in this section we will consider @xmath53 collision in a range of energies from threshold to lep2 , therefore we will include both photon and z - exchange with standard model vector and axial couplings to fermions , plus additional magnetic moment couplings given by eq .",

    "this can be easily understood , since standard model couplings of gauge bosons to fermions conserve chirality , while mass terms and magnetic moment couplings change it , therefore interference of magnetic moment contributions with standard ones should be proportional to the fermion masses and only the square of magnetic moments can be independent of fermion masses . in the limit of zero tau mass only the contribution iii ) is relevant , however there could be some range of the parameters in which contribution ii ) is higher than iii ) .",

    "the above bounds are completely model independent and no assumption has been made on the relative size of couplings @xmath23 and @xmath24 in the effective lagrangian ( [ eq : leff ] ) .",
    "for the sake of comparison with published data @xcite we present now the limits that can be found by considering separately only operator @xmath165 or only operator @xmath166 in the lagrangian ( [ eq : leff ] ) .",
    "consider that only @xmath165 is present , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , is equivalent to impose the relation @xmath167 .",
    "thus , from fig .  [ fig : gfit ] , it is straightforward to obtain that the bounds on the anomalous magnetic moment ( at @xmath1 ) are reduced to @xmath168 , while little change is found on the weak - magnetic moment @xmath169 .",
    "universality tests in @xmath40 decays do not provide any interesting constraint on the couplings @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "however , because of the relationship ( [ eq : epsilonw ] ) , the lep1-sld and lep2 constraints on @xmath82 and @xmath83 can be translated into constraints on @xmath144 ( or @xmath43 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : moments ] ) ) , the weak magnetic moment couplings of the @xmath40-gauge - boson to taus and neutrinos . in fig .",
    "[ fig : gfitw ] we present , in the plane @xmath83@xmath144 ( or @xmath6@xmath43 ) , the @xmath103 and @xmath1 regions obtained from our global fit to all data . clearly lep1-sld limits on @xmath82 coming from @xmath39-decays and the asymmetry and lep2 limits on @xmath83",
    "constrain @xmath144 very strongly . for comparison",
    "we also plot , as straight lines , the 1@xmath158 limits we have obtained from the universality tests in @xmath40 decays .      bounds on the anomalous electromagnetic moment of the @xmath123 can also be obtained from the radiative decay @xmath171 at lep1 @xcite . there , only the anomalous coupling @xmath6 is taken into account , while the contributions coming from the tau @xmath39-magnetic coupling @xmath7 are neglected . using this approach , with the inclusion of linear terms in @xmath6 in the cross section @xcite , and taking into account that the @xmath123 which emits the photon is off - shell , the analysis of the l3 @xcite and opal @xcite collaborations lead to the limits ( at @xmath172 cl ) : @xmath173}~,\\\\ & & -0.068<a_\\gamma<0.065\\ \\ \\",
    "\\mathrm{[opal]}~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : final2sigma ] ) our result , coming mainly from lep2 , is about one order of magnitude better than the ones obtained from the radiative @xmath39-decay . in both cases some of the particles in the vertex are off - shell .",
    "the interpretation of off - shell form factors is problematic since they can hardly be isolated from other contributions and gauge invariance can be a problem . in the effective lagrangian approach all those problems are solved because form factors are directly related to couplings in the effective lagrangian , which is gauge invariant , and as discussed in section  [ sec : el ] , the difference @xmath48 only comes from higher dimension operators whose effect is suppressed by @xmath49 .",
    "concluding , we have shown that the use of all available data at the highest available energies ( lep1 , sld , lep2 , d0 , cdf ) allowed us to strongly constrain all the magnetic moments ( weak and electromagnetic ) of the tau lepton without making any assumption about naturalness or fine tuning .",
    "the obtained bounds ( eq .  ( [ eq : final2sigma ] ) and eq .  ( [ eq : kweak ] ) ) , to our knowledge , are the best bounds that one can find in published data .",
