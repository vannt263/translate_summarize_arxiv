    "recently there has been an increasing interest in the wave operator on space times of low regularity , i.e. , the metric dalembertian @xmath0 of a lorentzian metric @xmath1 with levi - civit connection @xmath2 of low regularity @xcite .",
    "this development draws its physical motivation from an alternative approach to analyse space time singularities in general relativity put forward in @xcite .",
    "there c.  j.  s.  clarke proposed to treat singularities as obstructions rather to the well - posedness of the cauchy problem for the scalar wave - equation than to the extension of geodesics ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "8) for this standard approach ) . physically speaking , a scalar field  which can bee seen as a reasonable replacement for an extended test body , which is too hard to model in general relativity ",
    "is used to detect singularities , leading to the notion of generalized hyperbolicity .",
    "more precisely , a space time is called generalized hyperbolic and viewed as `` non - singular '' if the scalar wave equation can be uniquely solved locally around each point .",
    "of course , here one has to invoke a suitable solution concept since the coefficients of the resulting equation will generically be of low regularity .    in @xcite clarke",
    "proved generalized hyperbolicity of shell crossing singularities using a suitable weak solution concept . in @xcite vickers and",
    "wilson proved generalized hyperbolicity of conical space times using the theory of nonlinear generalized functions of colombeau @xcite .",
    "more precisely , they embedded the conical space time metric ( component wise ) into the ( full ) colombeau algebra and proved unique solvability of the wave equation in this framework invoking a refined version of higher order energy estimates ( cf .",
    "they also succeeded in showing that their generalized solution has a distributional limit that fits the expectations from physics .",
    "later grant , mayerhofer , and steinbauer in @xcite generalized the work of @xcite to a fairly large class of `` weakly singular '' space times , where essentially the metric was assumed to be locally bounded : modelling such space time metrics in colombeau generalized functions from the start , they proved generalized hyperbolicity , however , did not relate their result to more classical notions .    in this paper we consider a related but substantially different problem : we are concerned with the cauchy problem for second order linear hyperbolic tensor equations @xmath3 with low regularity coefficients on a _ classical _ manifold @xmath4 .",
    "it then follows that in any local coordinate system @xmath5 the differential operator @xmath6 takes the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 are the contravariant components of a lorentzian metric . in order to write @xmath6 in an explicit coordinate free way",
    "one then introduces a smooth background metric @xmath9 which enables one to write @xmath6 in the form @xmath10 with @xmath11 multiindices ( for details see below ) .",
    "here @xmath12 denotes the levi - civit connection with respect to the _ smooth _ metric @xmath9 , and we also work in the framework of non - linear distributional geometry @xcite , that is generalized functions in the sense of colombeau @xcite .    our motivation to study this problem is twofold .",
    "first , when inspecting the methods used in @xcite , we find that the ( one and only , singular ) metric has to play different roles in different places : as the principal part of the operator , defining the levi - civit connection , and defining the main part of the energy tensor which is the essential tool in deriving the key estimates .",
    "here we separate these roles by using the two distinct metrics @xmath1 and @xmath9 , where only @xmath1 , which defines the principal part of the operator @xmath6 , is of low regularity . the main benefit of doing so is to gain some new insight into the fine structure of the energy estimates and to improve on questions of regularity of generalized solutions .",
    "we remark that an elaborate regularity theory within algebras of generalized functions does exist ( see e.g. @xcite ) and connecting to it seems necessary to relate the results of @xcite to more classical function spaces .",
    "in particular , our asymptotic conditions on @xmath1 are quite different from those of @xcite and we also see that the results of @xcite can be improved , see remark [ rem : compare with gms09 ] below .    secondly , this strategy of using separate metrics essentially parallels the strategy used to derive the reduced einstein equations ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "7 ) ) , and , in fact , our equation is a linearization of the reduced einstein equations .",
    "so this work can be seen as a necessary first step to eventually treat these quasilinear equations in the generalized functions framework .",
    "this paper is organized in the following way : in the rest of this introduction we fix our notation and collect some prerequisites from nonlinear distributional geometry . in section 2 we formulate the cauchy problem for our class of wave - type equations of low regularity , and we state our main theorem of existence and uniqueness in section 3 .",
    "section 4 is dedicated to the heart of the proof , i.e. , higher order energy estimates , which we finally finish in section 5 .    throughout this paper",
    "we suppose @xmath4 to be a separable , smooth , orientable hausdorff manifold of dimension @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , we will make use of abstract index notation , see @xcite .",
    "in particular , a tensor field @xmath14 of type @xmath15 on @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath16 is denoted by @xmath17 or for short @xmath18 by using multiindices @xmath19 and @xmath20 of length @xmath21 resp .",
    "@xmath22 ( as usual @xmath23 denotes vector fields and @xmath24 denotes one - forms ) .",
    "thus for a vector field @xmath25 we write @xmath26 and for a one - form @xmath27 we write @xmath28 . the tensor product is simply denoted by concatenating the two objects in question , i.e. , @xmath29 .",
    "the operation of tensorial contraction is denoted by using twice the same index letter , e.g. , @xmath30 . for metric tensors @xmath31 , by a slight abuse of the multiindex notation , we write @xmath32 for @xmath33 , whenever @xmath34 .",
    "furthermore , the inverse of some metric @xmath35 will be denoted by @xmath36 with the same convention in the case of multiindices . to distinguish abstract index notation from calculations in coordinates",
    ", we will always use greek indices for tensorial components in a coordinate system .",
    "so , e.g. , the coordinates of @xmath37 will read @xmath38 .",
    "now we briefly recall the necessary facts from nonlinear distributional pseudo - riemannian geometry in the sense of j .- f .",

    "elements in @xmath45 are denoted by @xmath46=(u{_\\varepsilon}){_\\varepsilon}+\\mathcal n(m)$ ] .",
    "note that generalized functions can be localized in the obvious way , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "we introduce generalized numbers as the ring of constants in the special algebra , i.e. , generalized functions with vanishing derivative . for a characterization using asymptotic estimates",
    "we refer to ( * ? ? ?",
    "we obtain generalized tensor fields of type @xmath15 by setting @xmath47    this allows us to define the notion of a generalized metric on @xmath4 .",
    "a generalized pseudo - riemannian metric is a symmetric tensor field @xmath48 such that @xmath49 is invertible in the generalized sense , i.e. , for any representative @xmath50 of @xmath49 we have @xmath51    by theorem 3.2.74 in @xcite on any relatively compact set a generalized pseudo - riemannian metric possesses a representative @xmath52 consisting of smooth pseudo - riemannian metrics .",
    "this in turn can be used to define the index ( see @xcite , definition 3.2.75 ) of a generalized metric and finally , we call @xmath1 a generalized lorentzian metric if the index equals 1 .",
    "this fixes the signature of the metric to be @xmath53 or equivalently @xmath54 .",
    "any generalized lorentzian ( even pseudo - riemannian ) metric induces a @xmath45-linear isomorphism from @xmath55 to @xmath56 .",
    "moreover , we can adopt the usual classification of vector fields into spacelike , timelike , and null by demanding either @xmath57 , @xmath58 or @xmath59 , where we have used the notion of _ strict positivity _ :",
    "a generalized function @xmath60 is called strictly positive , denoted by @xmath61 , if @xmath62 for further details and , in particular , for a pointwise description , we refer to @xcite .",
    "for the rest of the paper we fix a smooth lorentzian manifold @xmath63 .",
    "we are interested in the local forward - in - time cauchy problem for hyperbolic linear partial differential operators with generalized coefficients , i.e. , @xmath64 with initial data @xmath65 here @xmath12 is the levi - civit connection of the smooth metric @xmath9 and @xmath66 denotes some initial surface with normal vector field @xmath25 ( to be detailed below ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 the low regularity coefficients of @xmath6 to be modelled in @xmath70 . in particular",
    ", @xmath1 will be a generalized lorentzian metric , and @xmath71 , @xmath72 will be generalized tensor fields of suitable type , subject to additional conditions to be specified later . also , the data @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 are allowed to be generalized , that is @xmath76 and @xmath74 , @xmath77 .",
    "we then look for solutions @xmath78 at least locally .    our first task is to specify a class of generalized lorentzian metrics suitable to act as a principal part of @xmath6 .",
    "so let @xmath79 be a generalized lorentzian metric with representative @xmath80 .",
    "we want to make sure that locally there exists a suitable foliation of @xmath4 . to this end",
    "we chose a relatively compact set @xmath81 and ask for the existence of a function @xmath82 such that @xmath83 is timelike with respect to @xmath1 .",

    "next we specify a number of asymptotic conditions on @xmath1 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 . to this end",

    "the level set @xmath66 is a past compact spacelike hypersurface such that @xmath98 , where @xmath99 denotes the future emission .",

    "some remarks on this conditions are in order : condition ( i ) gives @xmath85-independent bounds on the coefficients @xmath1 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 necessary later on to control the asymptotic behaviour of the energy integrals . strictly speaking the coefficients @xmath71 , and @xmath72",
    "depend on the choice of @xmath9 ; in fact the solvability of the differential equation does not , since we estimate on compact sets . observe that condition ( i ) also implies and @xmath103 for all compact @xmath41 . condition ( ii )",
    "is necessary to guarantee the existence of classical solutions on the level of representatives on a common domain . compared with @xcite , we demand less regularity on higher order derivatives of the coefficients but more regularity on the first order derivatives of @xmath1 .",
    "the latter becomes necessary since the connection @xmath12 is not derived from @xmath1 and therefore @xmath104 is generally non - vanishing .    to simplify the notation , we introduce the following abbreviations :    * @xmath105 , the generalized vector field associated to @xmath106 .",

    "following the general strategy for solving differential equations on a space of colombeau generalized functions , we have to pursue the following tasks : we start by writing out the initial value problem in terms of representatives , i.e. , @xmath117 then , using classical theory , we solve separately for each @xmath85 , obtaining a net @xmath118 which is a candidate for a generalized solution .",
    "however , to obtain existence in generalized functions , we first have to ensure that the @xmath119 are defined on a common domain ( which is guaranteed by condition ( ii ) in section [ sec : setting ] ) , and then we have to prove moderateness of the net @xmath118 . to obtain uniqueness of solutions , we have to show independence of the class @xmath120 $ ] of the choice of representatives of the data @xmath73 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 .",

    "in substance the proof of theorem [ th : main theorem ] relies on higher order energy estimates performed relatively to the foliation of @xmath87 into the spacelike ( with respect to @xmath1 ) hypersurfaces @xmath116 , @xmath128 of section [ sec : setting ] .",
    "we will relate the energy of the solution @xmath14 on a surface @xmath116 to the energy on the initial surface @xmath66 . to this end",
