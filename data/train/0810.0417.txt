    "in low - energy dissociative recombination ( dr ) two pathways of compatible strength , the direct and the indirect mechanism  @xcite , compete with each other and lead to interference effects resulting in rich resonant structures of the dr cross section  @xcite . these occur as both of them can often access the same neutral doubly excited dissociative state , which is formed by purely electronic energy exchange in the direct process and through intermediate ro - vibrationally excited rydberg states in the indirect process .",
    "non - adiabatic coupling mechanisms between the electronic and nuclear motion in the indirect process further cause the dr reaction to become particularly sensitive on the ro - vibrational state of the molecular ion  @xcite .    on the experimental side the resonant energetic structures in the dr cross section",

    "we have focused for the first time on the nature of the resonances appearing in hd@xmath1 dr at energies below @xmath2 mev through measurements of the fragment kinetic energy release ( ker ) and the angular distribution .",
    "thereby the fragment angular distribution can be related to the angular dependence of the electron capture reaction , i.e. its dependence on the angle relative to the molecular axis .",
    "however , the fragment direction reflects the initial orientation of the molecule only if its rotation proceeds slowly in comparison to the dissociation time ; only in this case the axial recoil approximation  @xcite is justified .",
    "the measurements presented here have been made possible by the new twin - merged beam setup with nearly monochromatic electrons at the heavy ion storage ring tsr in heidelberg , germany .",

    "the rotational levels of the molecular ions contributing to the resonances could then be extracted from the ker and revealed similar as the measured angular distribution likewise narrow variations as a function of energy as the dr rate coefficient .",

    "a ccd camera records the light spots at a frame rate of up to 30  s@xmath17 . in order to ensure that only fragments stemming from a single dr event are recorded in each camera frame ,",
    "the phosphor screen is switched off as soon as the first fragment arrives , but leaving enough time for the detection of the second particle .",

    "reference imaging measurements at the end of the initial 7  s and during the last 3  s are acquired , probing the rotational state distribution of the ions through dr at zero detuning energy .",
    "the first rotational probe is used to confirm that the same equilibrium state distribution for all measurements is reached before the ets energy is detuned , while the final reference measurement confirmed the absence of any significant rotational excitation by electrons at non - zero collision energy . in case of the use of the thermionic cathode the total storage time was 15",

    "fragments originating from a dr event arrive after a flight distance @xmath20 at the detector .",

    "latter contribution depends on the molecular ion rotational state @xmath24 through the ker , which is defined by the initial molecular ion and final fragment states as well as the electron collision energy .",
    "averaged over the interaction region in the ets with @xmath25 ( @xmath26  m ) two essential properties of the fragmentation process influence the observed transverse fragment distance distribution @xmath27 . towards the high distance edge , limited by the maximum distance @xmath28 , the sensitivity of @xmath27 on the ker increases and is thus dominated by the rotational level contributions .",

    "the parameters @xmath54 are fitted individually with the exception of those for the two lowest rotational levels , @xmath55 and 1 , which are forced in the fit to as the projected distance distributions for the lowest two rotational states can not be distinguished due to their small energy difference .",
    "this enables us in the further analysis to extract the relative contribution @xmath56 of the two lowest rotational levels .",
    "in contrast to earlier fragment imaging experiments the fits require legendre polynomials up to order @xmath47 , while contributions from higher orders were found to be negligible and were therefore set to zero in the final analysis . in the examples shown of fig .",
    "[ fig:2ddist ] the best fits are displayed together with some of their individual components .",
    "note that the low-@xmath24 contribution @xmath56 increases by more than a factor of two between 25 mev and 27 mev , i.e. within a small step of only 2 mev .",
    "moreover , the necessity to include the 4@xmath57 order legendre polynomial is stressed by comparing the total fit result to the contribution involving only the lowest two legendre polynomials .",
    "in the range below @xmath58  ev the dr cross section of hd@xmath1 is believed to be strongly dependent on the initial molecular ion rotational state  @xcite resulting in the pronounced structures observed in the measured rotationally averaged dr rate @xmath59 ( fig .",

    "this is convincingly corroborated by the effective rotational temperatures @xmath60 displayed in fig .",

    "we find that between 7 s and 17 s @xmath60 varies strongly as a function of energy on a similar narrow scale as @xmath59 and mostly deviates from the average state contribution @xmath60 probed by reference measurements at zero detuning energy ( shaded bars for the measurement at high and low electron density , respectively ) .",
    "note , that the effective rotational temperatures deduced at detuning energies @xmath61   mev do not depend on the different target electron densities employed in the measurements nor on the different initial rotational state distribution reached during the first 7 s of combined electron cooling ; this clearly shows that the observed variations of @xmath60 with @xmath3 are caused by the varying contribution of low and high rotational states to the dr rate . at zero detuning energy , on the other hand , the influence of superelastic collisions ( sec ) between rotational states , as reported in  @xcite ,",

    "are expected within this approach independent of the amount of the @xmath20 wave contribution which is present as well .",

    "particular one notes , that minima in the measured low-@xmath24 fraction , i.e. an enhancement of contributions from highly rotating molecules , tend to coincide with minima in the legendre coefficients , suggesting a loss of anisotropy due to a sizable rotation of the neutralized molecule before dissociation . while the direct mechanism of dr is expected to be fast , the indirect dr process  @xcite , involving ro - vibrational excited neutral rydberg states and thought to be responsible for the pronounced resonance structure in the dr rate coefficient , could well lead to delays in the dissociation comparable to the rotational period , thereby violating the non - rotation assumption of the axial recoil approximation .",
    "mqdt - calculations of the angular fragment distributions from the dr of hd@xmath1 including ro - vibrational couplings are presently being performed  @xcite ; so far , first results obtained in the axial recoil approximation show reasonable agreement with the data at selected electron energies but generally predict too large anisotropies , indicating again the need to expand the theoretical description beyond the axial recoil limit to arrive at a more detailed understanding of the fragment angular distributions observed in the dr of hd@xmath1 .      for a spherical symmetric energy distribution around the detuning energy @xmath3 the fragment angular distribution has to be isotropic for symmetry reasons if the detuning energy is adjusted to @xmath68 . however , due to the flattened velocity distribution of the electron beam , the spherical symmetry is violated and the fragment distribution may be anisotropic despite of @xmath3 being zero .    this effect could be observed for the first time in our present measurements ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2ddist](a ) ) . as expected , the anisotropy is found to depend on the transversal electron beam temperature as @xmath69 ; while the data collected with an electron beam from the photocathode , characterized by @xmath70 mev is still compatible with an isotropic distribution , a small but statistically significant negative @xmath64 coefficient was observed when using an electron beam produced from the thermionic source , which exhibited a perpendicular temperature of @xmath71 mev .",
    "note also that the negative sign of the extracted @xmath64 coefficient is consistent with the results obtained at non - zero detuning energies considering the change from a predominantly longitudinal electron approach to a case where the electrons are approaching mainly from the transverse direction .",
    "fragment imaging combined with a twin - merged beam setup opens up a new observational window on the kinematic nature of the dr process . high resolution and energy controlled",
    "measurements on a narrow grid of energies enable the study of the dr product kinematics down to a few mev .    for hd@xmath1",
    "this technique made it possible to focus on different aspects of the ro - vibrational capture resonances in the region of up to @xmath19  75 mev electron collision energy .",
    "firstly , the ker allowed us to determine the contribution of the lowest two rotational states of the hd@xmath1 ion in the recorded dr events . as a function of energy",
    "the @xmath56 fraction varies strongly , similar to the structure of the rotationally averaged dr rate coefficient @xmath59 .",
    "since the probe measurements confirm a common initial rotational state distribution and exclude different ion beam conditions , the collision energy dependent variations in the low-@xmath24 fraction thus reflect the sensitivity of the hd@xmath1 dr process on the initial ro - vibrational state .",
    "secondly , the measured fragment angular distribution reflects within the axial recoil approximations directly the dependence of the electron capture on the orientation of the molecular axis with respect to the incoming electrons .",
    "the angular distributions observed here require for the first time 4@xmath57 order legendre contributions for a complete description expected if @xmath66 waves are contributing in the entrance channel leading to dr .",
    "however , the @xmath65 coefficients are considerably smaller than expected and vary together with the @xmath64 coefficients on a similar energy scale as the dr rate coefficient @xmath59 .",
    "the partial correlation of enhanced contributions of highly rotating molecules and reduced legendre coefficients might indicate the break - down of the axial recoil approximation .    at zero detuning energy the flattened velocity distribution of the electron beam on the fragment distribution was studied . with an electron beam produced by the thermionic cathode of the electron target , which generates electrons at a higher transverse temperature as the photocathode source , a slight anisotropic fragment angular distribution",
