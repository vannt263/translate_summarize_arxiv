    "after over 20 years extensive studies , it has become clear that superconductivity in doped cuprates results when charge carriers pair up into cooper pairs @xcite as in the conventional superconductors @xcite , then these charge carrier cooper pairs condensation reveals the superconducting ( sc ) ground - state .",
    "however , as a natural consequence of the unconventional sc mechanism that is responsible for the high sc transition temperatures @xcite , the charge carrier cooper pairs in cuprate superconductors have a dominated d - wave symmetry @xcite .",
    "in particular , this d - wave sc state remains one of the cornerstones of our understanding of the physics in cuprate superconductors .",
    "however , in spite of the unconventional sc mechanism , the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experimental results have unambiguously established the bogoliubov - quasiparticle nature of the sharp sc quasiparticle peak in cuprate superconductors @xcite , then the sc coherence of the low energy quasiparticle peak is well described by the simple bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) formalism @xcite with the d - wave sc gap function @xmath0 . in this d - wave case ,",
    "the characteristic feature is the existence of four nodal points @xmath1 $ ] ( in units of inverse lattice constant ) in the brillouin zone @xcite , where the sc gap function vanishes , then the most physical properties of cuprate superconductors in the sc state are controlled by the quasiparticle excitations around the nodes @xcite .",
    "in particular , the key signature of the nodal quasiparticle transport appears in the microwave conductivity @xmath2 @xcite , which is essentially electromagnetic absorption by the quasiparticles excited out of the condensation ( either thermally excited quasiparticles or excitations created by the impurity scattering ) .",
    "understanding the role of impurities in cuprate superconductors has taken many years of great effort @xcite .",
    "this follows from that the physical properties of cuprate superconductors in the sc state are extreme sensitivity to the impurity effect than the conventional superconductors due to the finite angular - momentum charge carrier cooper pairing @xcite .",
    "experimentally , by virtue of systematic studies using the microwave conductivity measurements , some essential features of the evolution of the quasiparticle transport of cuprate superconductors with energy and temperature in the sc state have been established @xcite : ( 1 ) at low temperatures , the experimental results show the existence of the very long - live excitation deep in the sc state , as evidenced by the sharp cusplike energy dependent microwave conductivity spectrum , where the width of the sharp peak is nearly temperature independent , and main behaviors of the microwave conductivity are governed by thermally excited quasiparticles being scattered by impurities or other defects @xcite ; ( 2 ) at low energies , the temperature dependent microwave conductivity increases linearly with increasing temperatures at low temperatures , and reaches a maximum ( a large broad peak ) around intermediate temperature , then decreases with increasing temperatures at high temperatures @xcite .",
    "in particular , this broad peak shifts to higher temperatures as the energy is increased . theoretically , an agreement has emerged that the bcs formalism with the d - wave sc gap function is useful in the phenomenological description of the quasiparticle transport of cuprate superconductors in the sc state @xcite , although the sc pairing mechanism is beyond the conventional electron - phonon mechanism . in this case , the microwave conductivity of cuprate superconductors has been phenomenologically discussed in the zero temperature and energy by including the contributions of the vertex corrections @xcite .",
    "recently , these discussions have been generalized to study the temperature and energy dependence of the quasiparticle transport of cuprate superconductors in the sc state @xcite . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", the microwave conductivity of cuprate superconductors has not been treated starting from a microscopic sc theory , and no explicit calculations of the doping dependence of the microwave conductivity has been made so far .    in this paper , we start from the kinetic energy driven sc mechanism @xcite , and study the effect of the extended impurity scatterers on the microwave conductivity of cuprate superconductors .",
    "we evaluate explicitly the microwave conductivity of cuprate superconductors within the nodal approximation of the quasiparticle excitations and scattering processes , and qualitatively reproduced some main features of the microwave conductivity measurements on cuprate superconductors in the sc state @xcite .",
    "it is shown that there is a cusplike shape of the energy dependent microwave conductivity spectrum . at low temperatures ,",
    "the microwave conductivity increases linearly with increasing temperatures , and reaches a maximum at intermediate temperature , then decreases with increasing temperatures at high temperatures .",
    "in contrast with the dome shape of the doping dependent sc gap parameter , the minimum microwave conductivity occurs around the optimal doping , and then increases in both underdoped and overdoped regimes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present the basic formalism in sec .",
    "ii , and then discuss the energy , temperature , and doping dependence of the quasiparticle transport of cuprate superconductors in the sc state in sec .",
    "iii , where we show that the quasiparticle transport of cuprate superconductors in the sc state can be qualitatively understood within the framework of the kinetic energy driven sc mechanism by considering the effect of the extended impurity scatterers .",
    "finally , we give a summary in sec . iv .",
    "in cuprate superconductors , the single common feature is the presence of the two - dimensional cuo@xmath3 plane , and it is believed that the unconventional physical properties of cuprate superconductors is closely related to the doped cuo@xmath3 planes @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that the @xmath4-@xmath5 model on a square lattice captures the essential physics of the doped cuo@xmath3 plane @xcite , @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 is spin operator with @xmath9 as pauli matrices , the constrained electron operator @xmath10 with @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the chemical potential . in the constrained electron operator , the operators @xmath13 and @xmath14 are to be thought of as operating within the full hilbert space , while the constrained electron operator @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) does not create ( destroy ) any doubly occupied sites , and therefore represents physical creation ( annihilation ) operator acting in the restricted hilbert space without double electron occupancy @xcite .",
    "the strong electron correlation in the @xmath4-@xmath5 model manifests itself by the restriction of the motions of the electrons in the restricted hilbert space without double electron occupancy @xcite , which can be treated properly in analytical calculations within the charge - spin separation ( css ) fermion - spin theory @xcite , where the constrained electron operators are decoupled as @xmath17 and @xmath18 , with the spinful fermion operator @xmath19 describes the charge degree of freedom together with some effects of spin configuration rearrangements due to the presence of the doped hole itself ( dressed holon ) , while the spin operator @xmath20 describes the spin degree of freedom ( spin ) , then the motions of electrons are restricted in the restricted hilbert space without double electron occupancy in analytical calculations . in particular , it has been shown that under the decoupling scheme , this css fermion - spin representation is a natural representation of the constrained electron defined in the restricted hilbert space without double electron occupancy @xcite .",
    "moreover , these dressed holon and spin are gauge invariant @xcite , and in this sense , they are real and can be interpreted as the physical excitations @xcite . in this css fermion - spin representation ,",
    "the low - energy behavior of the @xmath4-@xmath5 model ( 1 ) can be expressed as , @xmath21 with @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the hole doping concentration . as an important consequence ,",
    "the kinetic energy term in the @xmath4-@xmath5 model has been transferred as the dressed holon - spin interaction , which reflects that even the kinetic energy term in the @xmath4-@xmath5 hamiltonian has strong coulombic contribution due to the restriction of the motions of electrons in the restricted hilbert space without double electron occupancy .",
    "recently , we have developed a kinetic energy driven sc mechanism @xcite based on the css fermion - spin theory @xcite , where the dressed holon - spin interaction from the kinetic energy term in the @xmath4-@xmath5 model ( 2 ) induces the dressed holon pairing state with the d - wave symmetry by exchanging spin excitations , then the electron cooper pairs originating from the dressed holon pairing state are due to the charge - spin recombination , and their condensation reveals the d - wave sc ground - state .",
    "moreover , this d - wave sc state is controlled by both sc gap function and quasiparticle coherence , then the maximal sc transition temperature occurs around the optimal doping , and decreases in both underdoped and overdoped regimes . in particular , we have shown that this sc state is the conventional bcs like with the d - wave symmetry @xcite , so that the basic bcs formalism with the d - wave sc gap function is still valid in quantitatively reproducing all main low energy features of the arpes experimental measurements on cuprate superconductors , although the pairing mechanism is driven by the kinetic energy by exchanging spin excitations , and other exotic magnetic scattering @xcite is beyond the bcs formalism . following our previous discussions @xcite ,",

    "( 17a ) , then the total self - energy function @xmath160 can be expressed as @xcite , @xmath161^{-1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath162 has been chosen as @xmath163^{-1}=91.35(t-0.005)^{4}j$ ] . using this total self - energy function @xmath164 to replace @xmath111 in eq .",
    "( 27 ) , we have performed a calculation for the microwave conductivity @xmath2 , and the results of @xmath2 as a function of temperature @xmath157 with energy @xmath165ghz ( solid line ) , @xmath166ghz ( long dashed line ) , @xmath167ghz ( dash - dotted line ) , @xmath168ghz ( dotted line ) , and @xmath169ghz ( short dashed line ) under the slightly strong impurity scattering potential with @xmath138 , @xmath139 , and @xmath140 at the impurity concentration @xmath141 for the doping concentration @xmath142 are plotted in fig . 3 in comparison with the corresponding experimental results of cuprate superconductors in the sc state @xcite ( inset ) .",
    "our results show that the temperature dependent microwave conductivity @xmath2 increases rapidly with increasing temperatures to a large broad peak around temperature @xmath170k for energy @xmath165ghz , and then falls roughly linearly .",
    "however , this broad peak in the microwave conductivity spectrum resulting from the temperature dependent impurity scattering rate in eq .",
    "( 28 ) is energy dependent , and moves to higher temperatures with increasing energies , in qualitative agreement with the experimental data @xcite .    within the framework of the kinetic energy driven d - wave cuprate superconductivity @xcite , our present results of the energy and temperature dependence of the microwave conductivity by considering the effect of the extended impurity scatterers are qualitatively similar to the earlier attempts to fit the experimental data by using a phenomenological d - wave bcs formalism @xcite .",
    "establishing this agreement is important to confirming the nature of the sc phase of cuprate superconductors as the d - wave bcs - like sc state within the kinetic energy driven sc mechanism .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that there are some subtle differences for different families of cuprate superconductors , and these subtle differences may be induced by the other effects except the impurity scattering .",
    "however , we in this paper are primarily interested in exploring the general notion of the effect of the extended impurity scatterers on the kinetic energy driven cuprate superconductors in the sc state .",
    "the qualitative agreement between the present theoretical results and experimental data also show that the presence of impurities has a crucial effect on the microwave conductivity of cuprate superconductors .",
    "in conclusion we have shown very clearly in this paper that if the effect of the extended impurity scatterers is taken into account in the framework of the kinetic energy driven d - wave superconductivity , the microwave conductivity of the @xmath4-@xmath5 model calculated based on the nodal approximation of the quasiparticle excitations and scattering processes per se can correctly reproduce some main features found in the microwave conductivity measurements on cuprate superconductor in the sc state @xcite , including the energy and temperature dependence of the microwave conductivity spectrum .",
    "the theory also predicts a v - shaped doping dependent microwave conductivity , which is in contrast with the dome shape of the doping dependent sc gap parameter , and therefore should be verified by further experiments .",
