    "a rapid development of experimental high  energy physics over the last decades of the xx century gave impetus to intensive investigations of various extensions of the standard model .",
    "its supersymmetric generalization known as the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is one of the most popular extensions of the standard model .",
    "the higgs sector of the mssm includes two doublets of higgs fields , @xmath4 and @xmath5 . upon a spontaneous breakdown of gauge symmetry ,",
    "each of them develops a vacuum expectation value ; we denote the corresponding vacuum expectation values by @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the sum of the squares of the vacuum expectation values of the higgs fields is @xmath8 , the ratio of the expectation values being determined by the angle @xmath9 . by definition , @xmath10 .",
    "the value of @xmath11 is not fixed experimentally .",
    "it is varied within a wide interval , from @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "within supersymmetric ( susy ) models , the upper and lower limits on @xmath11 arise under the assumption that perturbation theory is applicable up to the scale at which gauge coupling constants are unified , @xmath14  that is , under the assumption that there is no landau pole in solutions to relevant renormalization group equations .",
    "the spectrum of the higgs sector of the mssm contains four massive states .",
    "two of them are cp  even , one is cp  odd , and one is charged .",
    "the presence of a light higgs boson in the cp  even sector is an important distinguishing feature of susy models .",
    "its mass is constrained from above as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the @xmath17boson mass ( @xmath18 ) and @xmath19 stands for the contribution of loop corrections .",
    "the magnitude of these corrections is proportional to @xmath20 ( @xmath21 is the running mass of the @xmath22quark ) , depends logarithmically on the supersymmetry breakdown scale @xmath23 , and is virtually independent of the choice of @xmath11 .",
    "an upper limit on the mass of the light cp  even higgs boson within the mssm grows with increasing @xmath11 and , for @xmath24 , reaches @xmath25 in realistic susy models with @xmath26 .    at the same time",
    "it is known from @xcite that , for @xmath27 , solutions to the renormalization group equations for the @xmath22quark yukawa coupling constant @xmath28 are concentrated in the vicinity of the quasi ",

    "its value at the electroweak scale is @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the pole mass of the @xmath22quark . along with the @xmath22quark yukawa coupling constant , solutions to the renormalization group equations for the corresponding trilinear coupling constant @xmath35 characterising",
    "the interaction of scalar fields and the combination @xmath36 of the scalar particle masses also approach the infrared quasi  fixed point .",
    "the properties of solutions to the renormalization group equations within the mssm and the spectrum of particles in the infrared quasi ",
    "fixed point regime at @xmath0 were investigated in @xcite,@xcite .    a reduction of the number of independent parameters in the vicinity of the infrared quasi ",
    "fixed point considerably increased the predictive power of the theory . on the basis of the equation relating the yukawa coupling constant for the @xmath22quark with its mass at the electroweak scale @xmath37 and the value calculated for the running mass of the @xmath22quark within the @xmath38scheme ( @xmath39 )",
    ", it was shown in @xcite-@xcite that , for a broad class of solutions satisfying the renormalization group equations within the mssm and corresponding to the infrared quasi ",
    "fixed point regime , @xmath11 takes values in the interval between @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "these comparatively small values of @xmath11 lead to much more stringent constraints on the mass of the lightest higgs boson . a detailed theoretical analysis performed in @xcite,@xcite , revealed that , in the case being considered , its mass does not exceed @xmath42 , which is @xmath43 below the absolute upper limit in the minimal susy model .",
    "it should be noted that the lepii constraints on the mass of the lightest higgs boson @xcite are such that a considerable fraction of solutions approaching a quasi  fixed point at @xmath0 have already been ruled out by existing experimental data .",
    "all the aforesaid furnishes a sufficient motivation for studying the higgs sector in more complicated susy models , as well renormalization group equations and solutions to these equations therein .",
    "the present article is devoted to an analysis of coupling constant renormalization within a modified next  to  minimal susy model ( mnssm ) , where the mass of the lightest higgs boson can be as large as @xmath44 even at comparatively small values of @xmath45 .",
    "in addition , the spectrum of superpartners of observable particles and of higgs bosons is studied in the vicinity of the quasi  fixed point of the renormalization group equations within the mnssm .",
    "the next  to  minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) @xcite-@xcite is the simplest extension of the mssm .",
    "historically , the nmssm arose as one of the possible solutions to the problem of the @xmath46term in supergravity ( sugra ) models @xcite .",
    "along with observable superfields , sugra theories contain a hidden sector that includes the dilaton and moduli fields ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively ) , which are singlet in gauge interactions .",
    "the total superpotential in sugra models is usually represented as an expansion in the superfields of the observable sector ; that is , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the superpotential of the hidden sector .",
    "the expansion in ( [ 4 ] ) presumes that the parameter @xmath46 appearing in front of the bilinear term @xmath51 must be about the planck mass , since this scale is the only dimensional parameter characterising the hidden sector of the theory . in this case , however , the higgs bosons @xmath4 and @xmath5 acquire an enormous mass ( @xmath52 ) and @xmath53 symmetry remains unbroken .    in the nmssm , an additional singlet superfield @xmath54 is introduced , while the term @xmath55 is replaced by @xmath56 .",
    "a spontaneous breakdown of gauge symmetry leads to the emergence of the vacuum expectation value @xmath57 of the field @xmath58 and to generation an effective @xmath46term ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "the resulting superpotential of the nonminimal susy model is invariant under discrete transformations of the @xmath60 group @xcite .",
    "the @xmath60 symmetry of the superpotential of the observable sector naturally arises in string models , where all observable fields are massless in the limit of exact supersymmetry .    upon the introduction of the neutral field @xmath58 in the superpotential of the nmssm",
    ", there arises the corresponding @xmath61term in the potential of interaction of higgs fields . as a result ,",
    "an upper limit on the mass of the lightest higgs boson becomes higher than that in the mssm : @xmath62 in the tree approximation ( @xmath63 ) , relation ( [ 5 ] ) was obtained in @xcite . for @xmath64 , the expressions for the upper limit in the mssm and in the nmssm coincide , after the substitution of @xmath65 for @xmath46 .",
    "the higgs sector of the nonminimal susy model and one  loop corrections to it were studied in @xcite,@xcite . in @xcite , the upper limit on the mass of the lightest higgs boson within the nmssm was contrasted against the analogous limits in the minimal standard and the minimal susy model .    from relation ( [ 5 ] ) , it follows that the upper limit on @xmath66 grows with increasing @xmath67 .",
    "it should be noted that only in the region of small values of @xmath11 does it differ significantly from the analogous limit in the mssm . as to the small @xmath11 scenario ,",
    "it is realised in the case of sufficiently large values of @xmath68 .",
    "the growth of the yukawa coupling constants at the electroweak scale is accompanied by an increase in @xmath69 and @xmath70 at the grand unification scale ; therefore , the upper limit on the mass of the lightest higgs boson in the nonminimal susy model attains a maximum value in the limit of strong yukawa coupling , in which case both @xmath71 and @xmath72 are much greater than @xmath73 .",
    "unfortunately , we were unable to obtain a self  consistent solution in the regime of strong yukawa coupling within the nmssm featuring the minimal set of fundamental parameters .",
    "moreover , @xmath60 symmetry , which makes it possible to avoid the problem of the @xmath46term in the nonminimal susy model , leads to the emergence of three degenerate vacua in the theory . immediately following the phase transition at the electroweak scale",
    ", the universe is filled with three degenerate phases that must be separated by domain walls . however , the hypothesis of a domain structure of the vacuum is at odds with data from astrophysical observations .",
    "an attempt at destroying @xmath60 symmetry and the domain structure of the vacuum by introducing nonrenormalizable operators in the nmssm lagrangian leads to the appearance of quadratic divergences  that is , to the hierarchy problem @xcite .    in order to avoid the domain structure of the vacuum and to obtain a self  consistent solution in the regime of strong yukawa coupling ,",
    "it is necessary to modify the nonminimal susy model . the simplest way to modify",
    "the nmssm is to introduce additional terms in the superpotential of the higgs sector , @xmath55 and @xmath74 @xcite , that are not forbidden by gauge symmetry .",
    "the additional bilinear terms in the nmssm superpotential destroy @xmath60 symmetry , and domain walls are not formed in such a theory . upon the introduction of the parameter @xmath46 , it becomes possible to obtain the spectrum of susy particles in the modified model ; for a specific choice of @xmath75 , the mass of the lightest higgs boson reaches its upper limit , taking the largest value at @xmath76 . in analysing the modified nmssm ,",
    "it is therefore reasonable to set the coupling constant for the self  interaction of neutral superfields @xmath54 to zero .",
    "the mnssm superpotential involves a large number of yukawa coupling constants . at @xmath0 , they are all negligibly small , however , with the exception of the @xmath22quark yukawa coupling constant @xmath77 and the coupling constant @xmath78 , which is responsible for the interaction of the superfield @xmath54 with the doublets @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "thus , the total superpotential of the modified nmssm can be represented in the form @xmath81 within sugra models , the terms in the superpotential ( [ 6 ] ) that are bilinear in the superfields can be generated owing to the term @xmath82 in the khler potential @xcite,@xcite or owing to the nonrenormalized interaction of fields from the observable and the hidden sector ( this interaction may be due to nonperturbative effects ) @xcite,@xcite .",
    "along with the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath75 , the masses of scalar fields @xmath83 , and the gaugino masses @xmath84 are also generated upon a soft breakdown of supersymmetry .",
    "moreover , a trilinear coupling constant @xmath85 for the interaction of scalar fields is associated in the total lagrangian of the theory with each yukawa coupling constant , while a bilinear coupling constant @xmath86(@xmath87 ) is associated there with the parameter @xmath46(@xmath75 ) .",
    "the hypothesis of universality of these constants at the scale @xmath3 makes it possible to reduce their number to four : the scalar particle mass @xmath88 , the trilinear coupling constant @xmath89 and the bilinear coupling constant @xmath90 for the interaction of scalar fields , and the gaugino mass @xmath91 .",
    "the mnssm parameters @xmath92 specified at the grand unification scale evolve down to the electroweak scale or the scale of supersymmetry breakdown .",
    "their renormalization is determined by the set of renormalization group equations , these equations for the coupling constants @xmath78 , @xmath77 , @xmath85 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 being coincident with the corresponding renormalization group equations within the nmssm ( see , for example , @xcite ) if one sets @xmath76 in them .",
    "the equations describing the evolution of @xmath46 , @xmath75 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 within the modified nmssm were obtained in @xcite .    even in the one  loop approximation ,",
    "the full system of renormalization group equations is nonlinear , so that it is hardly possible to solve it analytically .",
    "this set of equations can be broken down into two subsets .",
    "the first subset includes equations that describe the evolution of gauge and yukawa coupling constants and of parameters @xmath46 and @xmath75 .",
    "the second subset comprises equations for the parameters of a soft breakdown of supersymmetry .    in studying the evolution of the yukawa coupling constants , it is convenient to introduce , instead of the constants @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath31 , the ratios @xmath93 where @xmath94 .",
    "the region of admissible values of the yukawa coupling constants at the electroweak scale is bounded by the quasi  fixed ( or hill ) line . beyond this region ,",
    "solutions to the renormalization group equations for @xmath95 develop a landau pole below the scale @xmath3 , so that perturbation theory becomes inapplicable for @xmath96 . the results of our numerical calculations are presented in fig . 1 , whence one can see that , in the regime of strong yukawa coupling , all solutions for @xmath95",
    "are attracted to the hill line , which intersects the @xmath97 axis at the point whose coordinates @xmath98 correspond to the quasi  fixed point in the mssm .    in analysing the results of the numerical calculations ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , attention is captured by a pronounced nonuniformity in the distribution of solutions to the renormalization group equations along the quasi  fixed line .",
    "the main reason behind this is that , in the regime of strong yukawa coupling , solutions are attracted not only to the quasi  fixed but also to the infrared fixed ( or invariant ) line .",
    "the latter connects two fixed points .",
    "one of them is the stable infrared fixed point for the set of renormalization group equations within the mnssm @xmath99 @xcite . as the invariant line approaches this point , @xmath100 .",
    "the other fixed point @xmath101 corresponds to large values of the yukawa coupling constants , @xmath102 , in which case the gauge coupling constants can be disregarded @xcite . in the limiting case of @xmath103 , the asymptotic behaviour of the curve being studied",
    "is given by @xmath104 the infrared fixed lines and their properties in the minimal standard and the minimal supersymmetric model were studied in detail elsewhere @xcite .    with increasing initial values of the yukawa coupling constants",
    "@xmath105 and @xmath106 at the grand unification scale , the region where solutions are concentrated at the electroweak scale shrinks abruptly and all solutions to the renormalization group equations within the mnssm are focused near the point of intersection of the invariant and the quasi  fixed line : @xmath107 this point can be considered as the quasi  fixed point for the set of renormalization group equations for the modified nmssm @xcite .    among subsidiary constraints that are frequently imposed in studying supersymmetric models , we would like to mention the unification of the yukawa coupling constants for the @xmath1quark and the @xmath2lepton at the scale @xmath3 ; this usually occurs in minimal schemes for unifying gauge interactions  for example , in those that are based on the @xmath108 , the @xmath109 , or the @xmath110 group .",
    "the unification of @xmath111 and @xmath112 within the mnssm is realised only in the case where the constants satisfy a specific relation between @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "integrating the renormalization group equations and substituting @xmath115 , which corresponds to @xmath116 and @xmath117 , we obtain @xmath118^{{\\frac{\\scriptstyle 21}{\\scriptstyle 2 } } } \\left[\\frac{\\tilde{\\alpha}_3(t_0)}{\\tilde{\\alpha}_3(0)}\\right]^{{\\frac{\\scriptstyle 68}{\\scriptstyle 9 } } } \\left[\\frac{\\tilde{\\alpha}_2(t_0)}{\\tilde{\\alpha}_2(0)}\\right]^{{\\frac{\\scriptstyle 9}{\\scriptstyle 4 } } } \\left[\\frac{\\tilde{\\alpha}_1(t_0)}{\\tilde{\\alpha}_1(0)}\\right]^{{\\frac{\\scriptstyle 463}{\\scriptstyle 396 } } } \\left[\\frac{y_{\\lambda}(0)}{y_{\\lambda}(t_0)}\\right]^{{\\frac{\\scriptstyle 1}{\\scriptstyle 4}}}\\approx 3.67 \\left[\\frac{y_{\\lambda}(0)}{y_{\\lambda}(t_0)}\\right]^{{\\frac{\\scriptstyle 1}{\\scriptstyle 4}}}. \\label{9}\\ ] ] the results obtained here indicate that @xmath119 unification is possible under the condition that @xmath120 , which is realised only in the regime of strong yukawa coupling . by varying the running mass @xmath121 of the @xmath1quark from @xmath122 to @xmath123 , we found that the equality of the yukawa coupling constants at the grand unification scale can be achieved only at @xmath124 .",
    "the possibility of unifying the yukawa coupling constants within the nmssm was comprehensively studied in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the condition @xmath125 imposes stringent constraints on the parameter space of the model being studied .",
    "since @xmath111 and @xmath112 are small in magnitude at @xmath0 , they can be generated , however , owing to nonrenormalizable operators upon a spontaneous breakdown of symmetry at the grand unification scale . in this case",
    ", @xmath111 and @xmath112 may be different . in studying the spectrum of superpartners below",
    ", we will not therefore assume that @xmath126 .",
    "if the evolution of gauge and yukawa coupling constants is known , the remaining subset of renormalization group equations within the mnssm can be treated as a set of linear differential equations for the parameters of a soft breakdown of supersymmetry .",

    "the results of our numerical calculations reveal that these functions greatly depend on the choice of yukawa coupling constants at the scale @xmath3 .    in analysing the behaviour of solutions to the renormalization group equations in the regime of strong yukawa coupling ,",
    "it is more convenient to consider , instead of the squares of the scalar particle masses , their linear combinations @xmath136 for the universal boundary conditions , solutions to the differential equations for @xmath137 can be represented in the same form as the solutions for @xmath128 ( see ( [ 10 ] ) ) ; that is @xmath138 since the homogeneous equations for @xmath127 and @xmath137 have the same form , the functions @xmath139 and @xmath130 coincide .    with increasing @xmath140 , the functions @xmath141 , @xmath142 , and @xmath143 decrease and tend to zero in the limit @xmath144 .",
    "concurrently , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , and @xmath148 become independent of @xmath89 and @xmath149 , while relations ( [ 10 ] ) and ( [ 12 ] ) are significantly simplified .",
    "this behaviour of the solutions in question implies that , as the solutions to the renormalization group equations for the yukawa coupling constants approach quasi ",
