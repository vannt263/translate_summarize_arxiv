    "amongst the various techniques used to discretize partial differential equations , spectral methods , introduced by d. gottlieb and s. orszag in the seventies  @xcite , offer high accuracy at a low computational cost .",
    "their principle is to approximate solutions of pdes by truncated fourier series or high degree polynomials .",
    "these methods have an infinite order of convergence , because the error between the exact and discrete solutions is only limited by the regularity of the exact solution .",
    "spectral methods resort to fourier series in the case of periodic boundary conditions ; whereas polynomial approximations use orthogonal polynomials ( such as chebyshev or legendre polynomials ) .",

    "both numerical analysis and implementation of spectral methods are based on orthogonal polynomials , whose major properties are hereby recalled .",
    "we shall then emphasize the importance of sturm - liouville problems in the case of legendre polynomials , and mention results about polynomial approximation and interpolation .",
    "several textbooks cover this domain , for instance  @xcite ,  @xcite , or  @xcite , and provide comprehensive proofs of the following results .",
    "let @xmath2 be the interval @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote a weight on @xmath2 , i.e , @xmath5 and @xmath6 on @xmath2 .",

    ", the monic orthogonal polynomials satisfy the following induction formula .    for all integer @xmath19 , @xmath20    finally , a wide class of orthogonal polynomials belongs to singular sturm - liouville solutions , on which spectral discretizations rely .",

    "the equation ( [ eq - dif - legendre ] ) means that legendre polynomials are eigenvectors of this operator , which is the origin of the  spectral \" adjective of the numerical methods hereby discussed .",
    "a consequence of ( [ eq - dif - legendre ] ) ( through integration by parts ) is that , for all positive integers @xmath28 and @xmath17 : @xmath29 this means that the @xmath30 , @xmath31 form a basis of orthogonal polynomials in @xmath32 .",
    "this section illustrates why spectral methods are so accurate .",
    "the sturm - liouville operator @xmath25 enables us to put some upper bounds on the distance between functions with a given regularity and a polynomial space , still in the case of legendre polynomials .",

    "it has been first estimated in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath33 be a positive integer , @xmath34 stands for the space of polynomials with degree less than @xmath33 , and the orthogonal projector from @xmath27 to @xmath34 is denoted by @xmath35 . for any integer @xmath36 , @xmath37 stands for the sobolev space of order @xmath28 on @xmath2 .",

    "the power depends only on the chosen norm , and the regularity of the function . however , this result has few direct numerical applications .",
    "indeed , one has to compute integrals to obtain the polynomial approximating the function , which is highly time - expensive .",

    "we saw previously that the liouville operator was crucial to obtain an efficient polynomial approximation .",

    "one must notice that every sturm - liouville problem does not ensure the convergence of the associated spectral method .",
    "let us consider the following example ;    @xmath62    its eigenvalues are @xmath63 , with eigenfuctions @xmath64 .",

    "singular_. in the case of singular problems , efficient polynomial approximation is ensured .",

    "let us note @xmath65 a family of polynomial solutions of degree @xmath44 of a singular sturm - liouville problem with eigenvalues @xmath66 , then one can see that @xmath67 is a polynomial of degree zero , @xmath68 has degree @xmath69 , and @xmath70 has degree @xmath12 , according to the following identity :    @xmath71    since @xmath59 vanishes in @xmath18 and in @xmath12 , @xmath72 .",

    "an integrability condition on @xmath4 imposes @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
