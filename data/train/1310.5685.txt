    "<S> this novel phenomenon can be adopted to demonstrate the symmetry - protection for mzbms by c@xmath4 group of the original system .    </S>",
    "<S> finally we show how to generalize the above results for a system with c@xmath4 symmetry to the system with generic c@xmath7 symmetry , in which case the surface has @xmath8 dirac cones related by the @xmath8-fold rotational symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> note that the four mzbms @xmath124 consist of a 4d reducible representation of c@xmath125 group . in the diagonal bases given by @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 </S>",
    "<S> , the group element can be represented as @xmath129=[1,-1,-i , i]^{\\rm diag}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> then each of the two majorana bases and two complex fermion bases consists of a 1d irreducible representation . for a unitary group </S>",
    "<S> , it can be shown that only the majorana bases ( @xmath130 ) which consist of independent 1d irreducible representations are protected by the symmetry group , while the complex fermion bases are not  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this result provides an alterative interpretation of the protection of two mzbms in the c@xmath4-symmetric system . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , for a system with c@xmath7 symmetry , from the @xmath8 mzbms we can obtain @xmath8 independent 1d irreducible representations of the c@xmath7 group , with the representation matrix given by @xmath131=[1,e^{i\\pi / n},e^{i2\\pi / n}, ... ,-1, ... ,e^{i(2n-1)\\pi / n}]^{\\rm diag}$ ] . again </S>",
    "<S> only the two real eigenvalues @xmath132 correspond to the majorana bases ( denoted by @xmath133 ) for the representation space , which are protected by the c@xmath7 symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining bases are complex fermion modes and can be gapped out without breaking c@xmath7 symmetry . with this general proof </S>",
    "<S> one can also know that a c@xmath134 symmetry can not protect any majorana mode .    for the generic c@xmath7-symmetric system , applying an external field </S>",
    "<S> can gap out all the majorana modes but restore two of them @xmath8 times when the field varies one cycle in the direction . actually , when the angle @xmath90 of the field advances @xmath135 , the new coupling hamiltonian @xmath136 should generically return to @xmath137 by a c@xmath7 rotation : @xmath138 . </S>",
    "<S> the c@xmath7 rotation transforms the complex fermion mode @xmath139 through @xmath140 and @xmath141 according to the eigenvalues of the representation matrix @xmath131 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the ground state changes fermion parity and one level crossing occurs . </S>",
    "<S> the generality of this result can be understood in an intuitive picture . </S>",
    "<S> namely , in the coupling hamiltonian @xmath97 the c@xmath7 symmetry is broken for any fixed @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> however , if the external field co - rotate with the c@xmath7 transformation , the entire system including the topological crystalline sc and the field is c@xmath7-invariant . </S>",
    "<S> this property ensures that the @xmath8-time restoration is independent of the details of the coupling hamiltonian and can be a unique signature of the protection of majorana modes by the c@xmath7 symmetry .    before conclusion we provide further discussions on the realistic experimental observations . </S>",
    "<S> note that the interface between a tci and a substrate superconductor is not easily accessible , and a realistic measurement can be carried out when majorana zero modes also exist in the vortex core of the top surface . </S>",
    "<S> this might be achieved by considering a tci thin film with a few atomic layers so that the superconductivity can be induced in both the top surface and the tci / superconductor interface . on the other hand , a sufficient minigap in the vortex core , given by @xmath142 with @xmath143 the fermi energy away from the dirac point , </S>",
    "<S> is necessary to distinguish the zero bias peak of majorana zero modes from the contribution by low - energy abss . besides tuning @xmath143 close to the dirac point , </S>",
    "<S> another promising way to enhance minigap is to apply a d - wave high tc superconductor substrate , which does not change the above predicted results , but can greatly enhance the proximity induced superconductivity in the top surface . </S>",
    "<S> based on the recent experimental results  @xcite , a full superconducting gap in the order of @xmath144mev is obtained in the surface states of a topological insulator thin film with 7 quintuple layers and coupled to a cuprate superconductor . in such case with a fermi energy tuned to be less than @xmath145mev away from the dirac point , the minigap of the system can be greater than 0.1mev , which is resolvable in the present experiments . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the oscillatory dependence of the energy of the lowest abss can be detected by periodic restoration of the zero bias peak measured through scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) when the direction of the external field varies . </S>",
    "<S> note that the stm measurement has a resolution limit , and in the measurement the zero bias peak may occur , while being suppressed , when the splitting of majorana modes is small . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the maximum height of the zero bias peak is obtained when two majorana modes are exactly restored in the @xmath8 ( for a system with @xmath146 symmetry ) uniformly distributed angles of the external field , and this phenomenon can reflect the @xmath146 symmetry in the experimental measurement .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have studied majorana zero modes protected by 2d cyclic symmetries in the topological crystalline scs and proposed how to demonstrate the symmetry protection of majorana modes . </S>",
    "<S> a new class of 2d topological superconducting phase has been predicted by inducing @xmath0-wave superconductivity in the @xmath1-surface of the crystalline insulator pb@xmath2sn@xmath3te , with two majorana modes in each vortex core are protected by the c@xmath4 lattice symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we have shown a novel mechanism that with an external field applied in - plane to break the c@xmath125 symmetry , the two majorana modes are lifted to finite energy states in general , but , surprisingly , they are restored exactly four times when the field varies @xmath111 , i.e. one cycle in the direction . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon has a nontrivial correspondence to the four - fold cyclic symmetry of the original system and can provide an unambiguous signature for the lattice - symmetry protection of the mzbms . </S>",
    "<S> we have generalized these results to the system with generic c@xmath7 symmetry , in which case there are always two majorana modes protected by the cyclic lattice symmetry , and the lattice - symmetry protection of such modes can be demonstrated in the @xmath8 times of zero - energy crossing when the external field varies one cycle in direction . </S>",
    "<S> our results may provide important insights into the future study of rich physics about symmetry - protection and classification of topological crystalline scs .    </S>",
