    "the interesting and anomalous properties of the manganites showing a colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) compounds are thought to originate from the competition between charge , lattice and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "the fundamental mechanism of cmr is reasonably understood within a framework of the double exchange model , which is based on the hopping effect of @xmath12@xmath13 electrons between mn@xmath14 and mn@xmath15 ions [ 1 - 2 ] .",
    "in such a case the ferromagnetic interaction arises from the strong on - site coupling between the charge carriers ( @xmath12@xmath13-state ) and the local spins ( @xmath16@xmath17-state ) . however , there are many experimental reports that can not be explained by this framework at present . since the discovery of the larger magnitude of cmr in so - called 327 bilayer manganese oxide : la@xmath18sr@xmath19mn@xmath4o@xmath5 , a considerable research effort has been devoted to the understanding of the properties of these compounds [ 3 - 4 ] .",

    "the first - order transition is accompanied by a remarkable negative magnetostriction , indicating the presence of important interplay among spin , carrier and orbital degrees of freedom [ 7 - 8 ] .",

    "this concentration area seems to be nearby the magnetically frustrated point ( fp ) in which ferro and antiferromagnetic interactions compete considerably with one another ( although this origin is not clear yet ) .",
    "since several vital interactions compete with each other , that is , the resultant instability of magnetic , lattice and band properties , it is expected that a unique phase or phenomena may be induced by external variables such as pressure and magnetic fields .",

    "40 k inc . and",
    "denotes a result at 40 k in the increase and decrease process with respect to a magnetic field , respectively . ]",
    "first , we discuss the obtained elastic anomalies in the field dependence of elastic constants .",
    "let us compare them with the magnetization curves as shown in fig . 13 . a sharp softening accompanied by a prominent hysteresis",
    "was observed at metamagnetic transition field @xmath7@xmath22 at @xmath21= 3.7 k and 30 k. on the other hand , a softening without any hysteresis was observed when crossing the transition field at the temperature of 80 k. the critical temperature is roughly estimated to be 40 k. from this result , one can see the correlative relation between them .",
    "it is likely that the elastic anomalies accompanied with a metamagnetic transition are responsible for electron - phonon effect .",
    "in such a case the elastic softening is related to the magnetic susceptibility , @xmath8@xmath9=@xmath10@xmath11/@xmath10@xmath7[22 - 24 ] . a strong coupling between elastic strains associated by sound waves and relevant conduction bands is usually described in terms of the magnetic gr@xmath47neisen parameter @xmath48@xmath46 = -@xmath10ln@xmath7@xmath22/@xmath10@xmath49@xmath50 , where @xmath49@xmath50 is the elastic strain with @xmath48 symmetry .",
    "then , the elastic softening is given by @xmath51 figure 14 ( a ) and ( b ) show the field dependence of -@xmath8@xmath9@xmath7@xmath28 below the critical temperature @xmath21@xmath42 of 40 k and above that , respectively .",
    "as compared to the measured field dependence of elastic constants , especially longitudinal ones shown in figs .",
    "2 and 3 , a good agreement with -@xmath8@xmath9@xmath7@xmath28 is achieved by adopting the single free parameter @xmath48@xmath46 at various temperatures , described by eq .",
    "( 1 ) . especially in the case above 40 k , we can obtain a good agreement , although some of them in the high field region and their quantitative aspects do not agree well between them .",
    "we emphasize that this agreement gives evidence for a strong spin - lattice coupling in lpsmo below @xmath21@xmath42 of 40 k. the expected upturn of elastic constant by -@xmath8@xmath9@xmath7@xmath28 above @xmath7@xmath22 below 40 k does nt appear in the measured elastic constants , which is expected by this calculated model .",
    "one scenario to explain",
    "the discrepancy is that the change of carrier number probably causes the difference as discussed below .",
    "next , let us discuss the coupling between the elastic strains and the conduction electrons .",
    "according to the deformation potential coupling theory , the coupling can be described as @xmath52 where , @xmath53@xmath54 denotes a single particle electron state and @xmath27@xmath50 the deformation potential coupling constant with @xmath48 symmetry [ 25 - 27 ] . the suffix @xmath48 denotes the irreducible representation in the tetragonal symmetry of the present system [ 19 ] . the free energy for conduction electrons @xmath55@xmath56",
    "may be expressed as follows , @xmath57 where @xmath53@xmath58 and @xmath59 denote the fermi energy and the number of the conduction electrons in the band , respectively . from the second derivative of the free energy , one obtains the expression of a relative change in the elastic constant .",
    "@xmath60 where , @xmath36(@xmath49 ) and @xmath61@xmath54 denote the density of state and fermi - dirac distribution function , respectively . for simplicity",
    "the coupling constant @xmath27@xmath50 is taken to be independent of @xmath62 ( rigid band model ) , in a two band model in which we assume them to be @xmath27(@xmath26@xmath28-@xmath29@xmath28 ) and @xmath27(3@xmath6@xmath28-@xmath30@xmath28 ) .",
    "then , the above formula leads to the `` band - jahn - teller effect '' one .",
    "it is expected that an increase of the density of states , i.e. , the carrier number contributes greatly to @xmath63@xmath35 .",
    "thus , a decrease of the resistivity as a function of magnetic fields leads to a decrease of the elastic constant as described by eq .",
    "we conjecture that this masks partly the expected upturn just above @xmath7@xmath22 .",
    "unfortunately , we can not discuss these changes quantitatively at present since the absolute values of the elastic constants were not estimated .",
    "nevertheless , we suggest that the elastic anomaly and the absence of the upturn of elastic constant above @xmath7@xmath22 below @xmath21@xmath42 are to be explained by the coupling between elastic strain and @xmath8@xmath9 , and between elastic strain and carriers , respectively .",
    "secondly we would like to discuss the phase iii .",
    "the obtained features may suggest this phase to be fairly metastable phase .",
    "figs . 2 , 3 and 4",
    "give typical examples to describe this situation .",
    "actually , the oscillatory phenomena is observed for @xmath35@xmath38 at 30 k , @xmath35@xmath37 at 30 k and 50 k and @xmath35@xmath39 at 10 and 30 k below @xmath7@xmath22 .",
    "the oscillations disappear above @xmath7@xmath22 and for higher temperatures .",
    "we conjecture that these oscillations may be related to the vicinity of magnetic instability , such as a spin - glass state , since the transition is accompanied by a prominent hysteresis in both results of ultrasonic and magnetization measurements .",
    "however , it is somehow unusual , because a slight anomaly is observed in the absence of a magnetic field .",
    "a spin glass - like behavior shows up only in a magnetic field . the critical temperature in the absence of a field is estimated to be around @xmath21@xmath42 of 40 k by interpolation of the boundary between the phase i and iii .",
    "again , this temperature corresponds to that at which a bend is observed in the resistivity curve .",
    "a slight anomaly was observed in both the temperature dependence of elastic constant and magnetization curve at this temperature .",
    "( la@xmath0nd@xmath1)@xmath2sr@xmath3mn@xmath4o@xmath5 and ( la@xmath64gd@xmath65)@xmath66sr@xmath67mn@xmath4o@xmath5 would be helpful to discuss this phase , which was reported previously by moritomo @xmath68 @xmath69 [ 28 ] and dho @xmath68 @xmath69 [ 29 ] , respectively .",
    "the similar phase shows up in ( la@xmath0nd@xmath1)@xmath2sr@xmath3mn@xmath4o@xmath5 ( @xmath6=0.4 ) at low temperature . in comparison",
    ", this phase is presumably due to metastable region where the parainsulator and ferrometal state can coexist .",
    "that is to say , ferromagnetic clusters can be grown by applying a magnetic field .",
    "this phase was understood within the framework of spin degree of freedom so far .",
    "our previous results of lpsmo for @xmath6=0.6 indicated that magnetostriction ( ms ) along the @xmath20-axis and in the @xmath41@xmath44 plane showed a sudden decrease and increase at the transition field , respectively [ 7 - 8 ] .",
    "furthermore , it should be noted that the transition is accompanied by a prominent hysteresis in ms .",
    "this implies that an orbital degree of freedom plays a crucial role in this ordered phase iii as well .",
    "the hysteresis region is observed in the elastic constants as a function of field becomes broader with decreasing a temperature in the phase iii .",
    "classical thermodynamics indicates that the first - order phase transition of the metastable state can occur under the condition that the potential barrier between two states is comparable with temperature [ 28 ] .",
    "thus it becomes difficult to transit between the metastable states with decreasing a temperature .",
    "this energy difference may correspond to @xmath21@xmath42 of 40 k. the results of elastic constants and ms as a function of fields imply that the two states : paramagnetic and ferromagnetic states have the each different state with respect to the @xmath12@xmath13 state .",
    "as was seen in lpsmo ( @xmath6=0 ) the @xmath12@xmath13 state is dominated by the @xmath27(3@xmath6@xmath28-@xmath30@xmath28 ) in the ferromagnetic phase , whereas an amount of @xmath27(@xmath26@xmath28-@xmath29@xmath28 ) population mixes into @xmath27(3@xmath6@xmath28-@xmath30@xmath28 ) component in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "recently , this behavior was confirmed microscopically by the neutron scattering measurement [ 30 - 31 ] .",
    "we speculate that this situation may provide the spatial disorder of the orbital state in addition to the magnetic disorder .",
    "finally , we would like to comment on nature of phase ii and iii .",
    "a distinct hysteresis was observed in phase iii .",
    "there is another boundary in phase iii , distinguished by iii and iii. it seemed reasonable to think that the boundary between phase iii and iii may be due to the rotation of a magnetic domain wall .",
    "we expect that the orbital glass state with respect to @xmath27(@xmath26@xmath28-@xmath29@xmath28 ) and @xmath27(3@xmath6@xmath28-@xmath30@xmath28 ) or / and orbital phase clusters : para- and ordered - cluster with @xmath27(3@xmath6@xmath28-@xmath30@xmath28 ) component could occur in the phase iii because the two orbital states can coexist at each mn sites in the phase iii in the above - mentioned way .",
    "that is to say , it seems that the ferromagnetic cluster arises because the two levels are close to each other in energy , and the occupation ratio strongly affects on the magnetic property .",
    "this situation lets us conjecture that the occupation ratio of @xmath27(3@xmath6@xmath28-@xmath30@xmath28 ) are different at each mn sites . as a result",
    "two kinds of the nearly - degenerate orbital : @xmath27(@xmath26@xmath28-@xmath29@xmath28 ) or @xmath27(3@xmath6@xmath28-@xmath30@xmath28 ) could be arranged randomly at mn sites , and cause the resultant spin - glass behavior .",
    "furthermore , this metastable state could vanish in phase ii , implying a uniform magnetic and a resultant uniform orbital state could be induced in phase ii .",
    "the experimental fact that no hysteresis is observed in phase ii supports this scenario .",
    "a rapid decrease of a relaxation time @xmath70 of the magnetization and magnetostriction in phase ii also supports this uniform state with respect to magnetic and orbital properties , @xmath71.@xmath12 .",
    ", disappearance of the glass state : @xmath72 @xmath73 in phase ii.[5 ] this is left to future studies . in order to confirm this point ,",
    "the frequency dependence of sound wave on elastic constants is currently in progress .",
    "we performed magnetization and ultrasonic measurements on lpsmo for @xmath6=0.6 single crystal as a function of temperature and magnetic field .",
    "a pronounced elastic anomaly was observed across the boundary of the each magnetic phases .",
    "we gave a useful phenomenological description of these results in terms of the coupling between elastic strain and @xmath8@xmath9=@xmath10@xmath11/@xmath10@xmath7 .",
    "the microscopic experimental and theoretical descriptions are still lacking .",
    "in addition , we found a new metamagnetic - like transition above @xmath21@xmath42 of 40 k in the magnetization measurement accompanying no hysteresis , indicative of second - transition nature .",
    "( @xmath7-@xmath21 ) magnetic phase diagram was determined , and it was found that the field - induced magnetic phase appears .",
    "this field - induced phase has a remarkable hysteresis , being indicative of the strong coupling among the spin , orbital and lattice of mn ion .",
    "it is noteworthy that a remarkable hysteresis in the elastic constants and also in magnetostrictions across the phase boundary of iii was observed .",
    "a comparison between the field dependence of elastic constants and magnetization gives their close relation combined by a single parameter @xmath48@xmath46 , indicating a strong spin - lattice coupling in lpsmo .",
    "there still remains the fundamental question why the phase boundary around @xmath21@xmath42 in the absence of field is not distinguished . for a further and qualitative discussion ,",
    "it is necessary to make clear the magnetic structure in the ordered phase iii and iii , and a microscopic description in the ordered states .",
    "we are grateful to y. tobinai , h. uematsu and m. nakamura for their help in the ultrasonic measurement and the operation of the cryogenic apparatus .",
    "the measurements have been performed in the cryogenic division of the center for instrumental analysis , iwate university .",
