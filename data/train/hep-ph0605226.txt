    "@xmath0 factory experiments have accumulated a lot of data and have reported many interesting results  @xcite .",
    "some observables , mixing - induced cp asymmetries for @xmath4 penguin modes , branching ratios and direct cp asymmetries for @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and polarization fractions for penguin - dominated @xmath3 modes , have exhibited some deviations from nave expectations in the standard model .",
    "it is necessary to go beyond nave estimations for understanding the observed deviations .",
    "the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) approach  @xcite is one of the theoretical attempts to include subdominant contributions , such as spectator and annihilation diagrams , and higher - order corrections .",
    "pqcd has applied to various two - body @xmath0 decays at leading order ( lo ) in @xmath7 and has made reasonable predictions for various decay modes .",
    "recently , the important next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) contributions were evaluated in the @xmath1 , @xmath6 , and @xmath8 decays to investigate the discrepancies between the lo pqcd predictions and the data  @xcite .",
    "this talk is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : pqcd ] , i briefly review the pqcd factorization formula .",
    "i discuss the branching ratios and the cp asymmetries of the @xmath1 and @xmath6 decays with the nlo corrections in sec .",
    "[ sec : pik ] .",
    "the lo pqcd predictions of the polarization fractions are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : vv ] .",
    "section  [ sec : summary ] is a summary .",
    "most of the calculations of @xmath0 decay amplitudes rely on the factorization of decay amplitudes into a product of short - distance and long - distance physics .",
    "qcd - improved factorization ( qcdf )  @xcite and soft - collinear effective theory ( scet )  @xcite are based on collinear factorization theorem , but pqcd is based on @xmath9 factorization theorem .    employing collinear factorization theorem",
    ", some decay amplitudes involve a singularity arising from the end - point region of parton momentum fractions .",
    "an end - point singularity implies that a decay amplitude is dominated by soft dynamics and can not be factorized .",
    "such soft contributions are regarded as phenomenological parameters , which can be fitted from the experimental data .    in the pqcd approach with @xmath9 factorization theorem ,",
    "the sudakov factor ensures the absence of the end - point singularities  @xcite .",
    "all amplitudes can be factorizable into parton distribution amplitudes @xmath10 , the sudakov factors @xmath11 , and a hard kernel @xmath12 : @xmath13 where @xmath14 stands for convolutions in both longitudinal and transverse momenta of partons  @xcite . the schematic picture of the factorization theorem is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : fact ] .",
    "meson decays in the pqcd approach .",
    "[ fig : fact ] ]    the distribution amplitudes , which are universal in the processes under consideration , are determined from experiments , the light - cone qcd sum rules , lattice calculations , or other theoretical methods . the hard kernel is characterized by a hard scale @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a hadronic scale and @xmath17 the @xmath18 quark mass  @xcite , and can be evaluated as an expansion in powers of @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the hard kernels of the spectator and annihilation contributions , as well as the emission contribution , are calculable and start from @xmath21 .",
    "pqcd predicts a large direct cp asymmetry in @xmath22 as a result of a large strong phase arising from annihilation penguin diagrams  @xcite .",
    "the current data of the direct cp asymmetries of @xmath5 and the branching ratios of @xmath23  @xcite , @xmath24 have been inconsistent with the expected relations @xmath25 these relations can be understood in the topological - amplitude decompositions  @xcite : @xmath26 and @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 stand for the color - allowed tree , color - suppressed tree , penguin , and electroweak penguin amplitudes , respectively , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the weak phase defined by @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 . assuming the hierarchies , @xmath37 for @xmath1 and @xmath38 for @xmath2  @xcite , the relations in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rel1 ] ) can be derived .",
    "the current data seem to require a large electroweak penguin amplitude  @xcite , a large color - suppressed tree amplitude  @xcite , or both of them  @xcite .",
    "the lo pqcd predictions follow the nave expectations as shown in tables  [ tab : br ] and [ tab : acp ]  @xcite .",
    ".branching ratios for the @xmath5 and @xmath6 decays in units of @xmath39 .",
    "[ tab : br ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath40 for @xmath41 remains as @xmath42 , which is consistent with the data , because this process involves additional tree amplitudes .",
    "the tree - dominated modes , which are insensitive to the sub - leading corrections , follow the nave counting rules in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vv ] )  @xcite .",
    "therefore , only the penguin - dominated modes @xmath43 and @xmath44 have exhibited anomalies in the measured polarization fractions .",
    "there have been several mechanisms proposed to explain the observed @xmath43 polarizations . in pqcd",
    ", it was proposed that the @xmath45 form factor @xmath46 , associated with the longitudinal polarization , may be smaller than the central value of the lo pqcd prediction  @xcite . postulating a smaller value , @xmath47 , which does not contradict to any existing measurements , @xmath40 for @xmath43 decreases to @xmath48 .",
    "another mechanism in pqcd was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . adopting a modified definition of the hard scale , which is a source of theoretical uncertainty , @xmath40 for @xmath43 could approach to @xmath48 .",
    "however , @xmath40 for @xmath49 becomes about @xmath50 , which is inconsistent with the data .",
    "this is because the sign of the real part of the annihilation amplitude for @xmath49 is opposite to that for @xmath43  @xcite .",
    "small @xmath40 for the penguin - dominated modes might come from the complicated qcd dynamics , but it is important to explain both the @xmath43 and @xmath44 data .",
    "in this talk , i have summarized the recent works on exclusive hadronic @xmath0 meson decays in the pqcd approach , concentrating on the observed deviations in the branching ratios and the cp asymmetries of the @xmath1 , @xmath6 modes , and the polarization fractions of penguin - dominated @xmath3 modes , which are sensitive to subdominant contributions .    including the important nlo contributions , the color - suppressed tree amplitude is enhanced by the vertex corrections , and therefore the predicted direct cp asymmetries of the @xmath1 modes become consistent with the experimental data .",
    "however , it is unlikely to accommodate both the @xmath51 and @xmath52 branching ratios to the measured ones simultaneously .",
    "the polarization fractions of the penguin - dominated @xmath3 modes deviate from the nave power - counting rules , including the spectator and annihilation contributions .",
    "however , it is not enough to explain the observed data . a small longitudinal fraction for @xmath43 might come from qcd uncertainty , but it is necessary to explain both the @xmath43 and @xmath44 data .",
    "nlo corrections to the polarization fractions should be studied in future work .",
