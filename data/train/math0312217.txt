    "the _ fully packed loop model _ ( fpl model , for short ; see for example @xcite ) is a model of ( not necessarily closed ) polygons on a lattice such that each vertex of the lattice is on exactly one polygon . whether or not these polygons are closed , they will be also referred to as _",
    "loops_. throughout this article , we consider this model on the square grid of side length @xmath0 , which we denote by @xmath1 . see figure  [ fpl22 ] for a picture of @xmath2 .    [ fpl22 ] ]",
    "the polygons consist of horizontal or vertical edges connecting vertices of @xmath1 , and edges that lead outside of @xmath1 from a vertex along the border of @xmath1 , see figure  [ fpl24 ] for an example of an allowed configuration in the fpl model .",
    "we call the edges that stick outside of @xmath1 _ external links_. the reader is referred to figure  [ fpl1 ] for an illustration of the external links of the square @xmath3 .",
    "( the labels should be ignored at this point . )",
    "it should be noted that the four corner points are incident to a horizontal _ and _ a vertical external link .",
    "we shall be interested here in allowed configurations in the fpl model , in the sequel referred to as _ fpl configurations _ , with _ periodic boundary conditions_. these are fpl configurations where , around the border of @xmath1 , every other external link of @xmath1 is part of a polygon .",
    "the fpl configuration in figure  [ fpl24 ] is in fact a configuration with periodic boundary conditions .     with periodic boundary conditions[fpl24 ] ]    ]    it is well - known that fpl configurations with periodic boundary conditions are in bijection with configurations in the six vertex model with domain wall boundary conditions , which , in their turn , are in bijection with alternating sign matrices ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "3 ) for a description of these bijections ) .",
    "every fpl configuration with periodic boundary condition defines a matching on the external links taken by the polygons , by matching those which are on the same polygon .",
    "there has been a lot of interest recently in the enumeration of fully packed loop configurations on @xmath1 with periodic boundary conditions , in which the matching on the external links is fixed . to a big part",
    "this is due to the fact that it was ( conjecturally ) discovered that these numbers appear as the coordinates of the groundstate vectors of certain hamiltonians in the dense @xmath4 loop model .",
    "( see @xcite for a survey of these developments and conjectures ) .",
    "although it is ( probably ) hopeless to expect a nice closed formula in general , that is , for the number of fpl configurations with periodic boundary conditions corresponding to a fixed matching , for an arbitrary such matching , there exist several conjectures on these numbers for special matchings ( see , for example , ( * ? ? ?",
    "8) ) . in @xcite",
    ", zuber added several new ones , one of which he proved immediately in joint work with di  francesco and zinn ",
    "justin @xcite .",
    "another conjecture in this direction for different boundary conditions , due to mitra et al.@xcite , was proved by de gier in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sec .  5 )",
    "( which is , in fact , the inspiration for @xcite , and also the present article ) .",
    "it is our purpose to prove two further conjectures from @xcite in this paper , see theorems  [ z1 ] and [ z2 ] .    in all the proofs ,",
    "the basic idea is to set up a bijection between the fpl configurations in question and rhombus tilings of certain regions , and then use known results on the enumeration of rhombus tilings to conclude the proof .",
    "this is also the procedure which we shall follow here .",
    "while in @xcite the base of de gier s result has been a theorem of ciucu and the second author @xcite , and in @xcite the base of the result by di  francesco , zinn  justin and zuber has been macmahon s formula for plane partitions contained inside a given box @xcite , here it is stanley s hook - content formula ( * ? ? ? * theorem  15.3 ) ( see theorem  [ ssyt ] below ) for the number of semistandard tableaux of a given shape with bounded entries which is at the heart of our proofs .",
    "( we remark that this formula implies macmahon s , see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proof of theorem  7.21.7 ) . ) in difference to @xcite , we are faced here with an added difficulty in the proofs , as it is necessary to split the enumeration problems considered here into several different subcases .",
    "another point worthy of note is the fact that our proofs use wieland s remarkable theorem of rotational symmetry @xcite ( see theorem  [ thm : wie ] below ) in an essential way , which is not necessary in @xcite .",
    "that is , our proofs depend crucially on the way the matching is `` placed around the square @xmath1 . ''",
    "we do in fact not know how to do the enumeration if we place the matching in a different way around @xmath1 . on the other hand ,",
    "it is obvious that , using our approach , one can as well prove the conjectures in appendix  a of @xcite , although we did not work out the details .",
    "we do indeed hope that a refinement of the ideas presented in this article will as well lead to a proof of conjectures  6 and 7 in @xcite .",
    "this is work currently in progress .    in the next section ,",
    "we collect all notation and the facts that we need in our proofs .",
    "the proof of conjecture  4 from @xcite is then given in section  [ con4 ] , while the proof of conjecture  5 from @xcite is the contents of section  [ conj5 ] .",
    "we start by introducing the notation that we are going to use for encoding fpl configurations and their associated matchings .",
    "the reader should recall from the introduction that any fpl configuration defines a matching on the external links taken by the polygons , by matching those which are on the same polygon .",
    "we call this matching the _ matching associated to the fpl configuration_. when we think of the matching as being fixed , and when we consider all fpl configurations having this matching as associated matching , we shall also speak of these fpl configurations as the  fpl configurations corresponding to this fixed matching . \"",

    "all the fpl configurations that are considered are configurations which correspond to matchings of either the even labelled external links or the odd labelled external links .",
    "let @xmath12 be any matching of the set of even ( odd ) labelled external links .",
    "let @xmath13 be the  rotated \" matching of the odd ( even ) external links defined by the property that the links labelled @xmath14 and @xmath15 in @xmath16 are matched if and only if the links labelled @xmath17 and @xmath18 are matched in @xmath19 .",

    "this being the case , we can represent matchings in terms of chord diagrams of @xmath22 points placed around a circle ( see figure  [ fpl25 ] for the chord diagram representation of the matching corresponding to the fpl configuration in figure  [ fpl24 ] ) .    ]    in our proofs we shall also use the following observation of de gier ( * ? ? ?",

    "[ fant ] ]    again we first suppose @xmath135 to be even , and we let @xmath136 .",
    "we call the centres of the @xmath130 , @xmath131 , and @xmath81 nested arches @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 , respectively , as before , see the right half of figure  [ fant ] .",
    "we place @xmath132 on the external link numbered @xmath170 .",
    "consequently @xmath133 is on the external link labelled @xmath171 , and @xmath134 is on the external link labelled @xmath172 .",
    "we introduce the same system of coordinates as in section  [ con4 ] , and we let @xmath145 , @xmath173 , @xmath174 and @xmath175 . then these points determine the triangles of fixed edges ( see figure  [ cha ] ) .",
    "again , the vertices @xmath149 and @xmath150 of these triangles have the same height , @xmath151 , and we have @xmath152 .    at this point , by lemma  [ fixedg ] , we can easily draw the set of fixed edges corresponding to our choice of the position of the centres @xmath176 , @xmath177 and @xmath178 ( see figure  [ fied ] ) .",
    "again , any vertex of the square grid belongs to at least one fixed edge",
    ". however , here we have to split our problem into four cases , according to the local configuration around the centre @xmath132 .",
    "there are indeed four mutually exclusive possible configurations near @xmath132 , see figure  [ config ] .    ]",
    "[ ex2]there exists a fully packed loop configuration for any of the four local configurations shown in figure  _ [ config]_.    again the proof is omitted since it is very similar to the proof of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma  3 ) .",
    "let @xmath179 be the number of fully packed loop configurations determined by the matching in figure  _ [ fant]_. then @xmath180    again , we only discuss the case where @xmath135 is even , since the other case is completely analogous .",
    "we already know that @xmath179 is the sum of four parts corresponding to the local configurations described in figure  [ config ] .",
    "in each of these cases we proceed similarly as in the proof of theorem  [ z1 ] .",
    "we draw a triangle around any free vertex in such a way that triangles share an edge if and only if the corresponding vertices are adjacent . after a suitable deformation of the corresponding regions",
    ", we can fit these regions in the regular triangular lattice .",
    "again , there are certain parts which are covered by forced tiles and which may hence be eliminated",
    ". see figure  [ config ] for an illustration of the resulting regions in each of the four cases ( the shaded triangles should be disregarded for the moment ) .",
    "we now observe that lemmas  [ locmov ] and [ ex2 ] imply that in each of the four cases there is a bijection between the fully packed loop configurations and rhombus tilings of the corresponding region in the triangular lattice .",
    "so the number of fully packed loop configurations is equal to the sum of the number of tilings of these four regions .",
    "we treat them one at a time .",
    "below , the numbers ( 1)(4 ) refer to the corresponding numbers in figure  [ config ] .    1 .",
    "consider the three shaded tiles .",
    "it is easy to see that exactly two of them should be chosen in any tiling of this region .",
    "if we choose the first two , then the region is split into two hexagons , a hexagon @xmath181 and a hexagon @xmath182 .",
    "if we choose the first and the third , then the region is split into a hexagon @xmath165 and a region @xmath183 .",
    "finally , if we choose the second and the third tile , our region reduces to a region @xmath122 .",
    "hence the total number of rhombus tilings in this case is@xmath184 2 .",
    "any tiling of the second region must contain exactly one of the two shaded tiles on the left and exactly one of the two shaded tiles on the right .",
    "if we choose the first on both the right and the left , then we obtain a hexagon @xmath185 and a region @xmath186 .",
    "if we choose the first on the left and the second on the right , we split the region into three hexagons , a hexagon @xmath185 , a hexagon @xmath182 , and a hexagon @xmath187 . if we choose the second on the left and the first on the right , we obtain a region @xmath123 . finally , if we choose the second on both the left and the right , we split the region into a hexagon @xmath187 and a region @xmath183 .",
    "hence the number of rhombus tilings in this case is@xmath188 3 .",
    "again , we have to choose exactly one of the two shaded tiles . if we choose the first one , we get a region @xmath186 , and if we choose the second one , we get two disjoint hexagons , a hexagon @xmath187 and a hexagon @xmath182 .",
    "hence the number of rhombus tilings in this case is@xmath189 4 .   in this last case",
    "we have to choose exactly one of the three tiles .",
    "if we choose the first one , we get a region @xmath124 . if we choose the second , we obtain a hexagon @xmath165 and a region @xmath186 , and if we choose the third one , we get a hexagon @xmath190 and a hexagon @xmath182 .",
    "hence the number of rhombus tilings in this case is @xmath191    putting everything together , the total number @xmath179 is given by the sum of these four expressions , that is @xmath192 now note that , by theorem  [ plapar ] and lemma  [ k(p , q , r ) ] , there hold @xmath193 and@xmath194 if we also recall lemma  [ l(p , q , r ) ] , then it follows that @xmath195 which agrees with the expression in the assertion of the theorem .",
