    "the ultraviolet ( uv ) flux of old stellar systems like galactic globular clusters ( ggcs ) is dominated by a minority of objects . amongst them , blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars and their progeny , like post - early asymptotic giant branch ( post - eagb ) or agb - manqu stars , are the strongest uv emitters @xcite .",
    "the relative contribution of the various types of stars to the total uv emission , as well as the factors that may lead to larger or smaller populations of uv - bright stars in a cluster still remain open issues @xcite .",
    "a complete census of hot stars in stellar populations is therefore a prerequisite for comparing evolutionary models with observations @xcite . in this regard ggcs",
    "are of paramount importance , since they are the closest example in nature of relatively simple systems and span a large range in metallicity , a small range in age and perhaps a range in helium abundance .",
    "moreover , being typically populated by some @xmath5 stars , even short - lived evolutionary phases can be properly sampled .",
    "ggcs can therefore be used to test stellar evolution models , one of the basic ingredients for the interpretation of the integrated light from distant galaxies .    our ability to predict the fractions of uv emitters in clusters",
    "is deeply linked to understanding the physical mechanisms driving the horizontal branch ( hb ) morphology .",
    "it is commonly accepted that metallicity is the first parameter affecting the hb morphology : metal - rich ggcs typically have red hbs , while metal - poor ones have more extended and bluer hbs .",
    "however , there are several clusters with the same metallicity showing remarkable differences in hb morphology .",
    "therefore , metallicity alone is not able to explain the complex hb zoology in ggcs @xcite .",
    "this issue , known as the `` 2nd parameter problem '' , has attracted the attention of several authors in the last decades @xcite . although there is a general consensus about the fact that age is the main _ global _",
    "2nd parameter , i.e. a parameter that varies from cluster to cluster @xcite , no combination of metallicity and age can fully account for the different hb morphology observed in several ggcs . in this sense a clear example is given by the clusters m3 , m13 , m79 and m80 @xcite .",
    "the necessity of an additional parameter was recently advised by @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) who suggested the cluster density ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and an internal spread of he abundance , respectively , as possible hb third parameters , that vary among different sub - populations within the same cluster .",
    "indeed ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) have been able to reproduce the complex hb morphology of the massive ggc 2808 by assuming different he abundances for the three sub - populations revealed by photometric @xcite and spectroscopic @xcite analyzes .",
    "in addition , @xcite have shown that variations in the he abundance can account for the differences observed among m3 , m13 and m79 .",
    "the typical approach to the study the hb morphology is to make use of parameters related to physical properties of hb stars @xcite .",
    "the effective temperature distribution of hb stars is the most efficient way to describe the hb morphology .",
    "it can be used to constrain the parameters driving the hb morphology in globular clusters thus shedding new light on our present understanding of the `` 2nd parameter problem '' .",
    "in addition the temperature distribution of hb stars is a prime ingredient to interpret the uv emission from unresolved stellar systems .",
    "the hb star effective temperature distribution has been studied in ggcs by means of optical data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , in the optical and for @xmath6 - 15,000k , hb stars get increasingly faint and describe an almost vertical sequence ( at approximately constant colors ) because of the strong increase of the bolometric corrections with .",
    "this makes color variations weakly sensitive to changes in temperature ( a change of a few tenths in color corresponds to a variation of several thousands degrees in ) .",
    "indeed , for ggcs with extremely bhbs , effective temperatures derived from optical color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) can be underestimated by up to @xmath7k , as shown in the spectroscopic @xcite and photometric @xcite analysis of the hb temperature distribution of ngc2808 .    to overcome this problem ,",
    "we have surveyed 31 ggcs spanning a wide range of metallicities , mass and structural parameters with the wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) on board the hubble space telescope ( ) , by using a combination of uv and optical filters ( prop .",
    "11975 , pi : ferraro ) .",
    "this dataset is ideal to characterize the properties of exotic objects in ggcs @xcite and indeed some results from this survey aimed mainly at characterizing the properties of blue straggler stars ( bsss ) have been recently published @xcite . with only a few exceptions , all target clusters",
    "have been observed in the f170w , f255w , f336w and f555w bands .",
    "this filter setup allows us to derive temperatures in the most appropriate cmd over the entire extension of the hb .",
    "the dataset is also complemented with observations collected during the last 20 years by our group with the same camera @xcite .    in this work",
    "we first introduce our methodology to determine the distribution along the hb of our sample of ggcs , and discuss several possible sources of systematic errors .",
    "we derive here the  distribution of hb stars in the massive ggc 7078 ( m15 ) .",
    "methods and results presented in this work will be used in the following papers of the series .",
    "we note that we chose this cluster as test case for our methods because it is the only target of the entire sample with a blue hb observed in the two far uv filters , namely f160bw and f170w .",
    "this will allow us to make an homogeneous comparison with previous results obtained only in the f160bw filter @xcite .    in @xmath8",
    "we describe the approach used for the  estimate .",
    "@xmath9 describes the observations and data reduction procedures .",
    "in @xmath10 we report the criteria adopted for the hb stars selection . in @xmath11",
    "the hb temperature distributions is derived .",
    "@xmath11 summarizes the main results .",
    "our methodology to determine the  distribution of the observed hb stars is very similar to what employed in the study of 2808 hb by @xcite .",
    "we consider the observed colors of each individual hb star in a given cluster , and derive the  by interpolating a cubic spline along the color - relation given by the appropriate theoretical zahb , suitably reddened according to the cluster estimated extinction .",
    "this approach neglects the post - zahb evolutionary effects on the color -  relation , that we will assess later in this section .",
    "we have employed the basti @xmath12-enhanced models by @xcite ; to account for the effect of radiative levitation in the stellar atmospheres , that sets in at about 11,500 - 12,000k ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we have applied bolometric corrections appropriate for [ fe / h]=0.0 and scaled - solar mixture to the hb models , when  is above 12,000k  , for the bolometric corrections at  larger than 12,000k and we found no appreciable difference in the resulting color -  relation . ] .",
    "while this is a crude approximation ( made necessary by the lack of more suitable complete grids of hb stellar evolution and atmosphere models ) , it still provides reliable measures of the temperatures when compared to spectroscopic estimates for hot hb stars ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "remarkably , we found that the color -  relation of our chosen filter combinations ( but not the individual magnitudes ) , is practically identical to the counterpart obtained from zahb models with the same composition but without the recipe to mimic the effect of radiative levitation above 12,000k .",
    "figure  [ fig : col - teffz ] displays the zahb color -  relations for five filter combinations ( employing the filters available from our observations ) with sufficiently large baseline and different metallicities . the effect of the metals is visible only below @xmath13k , mainly for ( @xmath14 ) and for the redder filter combinations that we are not going to use in our analysis ( see below ) .",
    "moreover , the differences shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : col - teffz ] are upper limits , since they are obtained for extremely different metallicities .",
    "our model grid allows us to pick zahb sequences with a metallicity within less than a factor of two of the estimates for each surveyed cluster , and therefore the related uncertainty on the individual  values below 8,000k is always kept below @xmath15k . we can conclude that metallicity does not play a major in the determination of the color - relations .     but for the ( @xmath16 ) -  relations obtained from hb tracks of different masses , with @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "crosses mark the zahb location of each displayed track ( see text for details ) . ]     but for the ( @xmath19 ) -  relations . ]     but for the @xmath20 -  relations . ]",
    "it becomes also clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : col - teffz ] that the ( @xmath21 ) and ( @xmath22 ) colors are the most sensitive to  variations ( they span a larger range for the same interval ) at any regime .",
    "however , the individual @xmath23 and @xmath24 magnitudes become very faint for @xmath25k , and our photometry in these filters can be severely incomplete . the second best choice for temperature determination below 10,000k is ( @xmath20 ) ; the color range is almost halved , but the completeness of our data is much more reliable .",
    "therefore this is our selected color for this temperature range .",
    "redder filter combinations are less suited for  determinations , and the ( @xmath26 ) color is almost insensitive to below @xmath13k .    given that it is now well known that stars within individual clusters can cover a non negligible range of he abundances ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* @xcite and references therein ) we have analyzed the impact of y variations on the zahb color -  relations . in particular , figure [ fig : col - teffy ] displays the effect of two different initial he mass fractions ( @xmath18 and @xmath27 ) on the predicted zahb color -  relations for the filter combinations we are going to use in our investigations .",
    "it emerges clearly that the effect of the in principle unknown y content of the observed stars is completely negligible at any .",
    "another factor that may affect the relation is the fact that stars along the observed hb are born with different patterns of cnona abundances . in (",
    "* see appendix",
    "a ) we have already shown that also the effect of the cnona anticorrelations is negligible .",
    "after having established the filter combinations to use for our estimates , and assessed the effect of the chosen initial chemical composition of the zahb , we address here the issue of the effect of surface gravity .",
    "we recall that we apply a color -  relation obtained from the zahb to the observed color of hb stars , irrespective of whether they are evolving close to the zahb or are evolved off - zahb . to assess the extent of systematic biases introduced by this procedure , figures [ fig : col - teffg1 ] , [ fig : col - teffg2 ] and [ fig : col - teffg3 ] display the relevant color -  relations for hb tracks of different masses and the same initial chemical composition ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "for the ( @xmath22 ) and ( @xmath29 ) colors the effect of off - zahb evolution is negligible at all  covered by the models . in fact , in the color -  diagram the off - zahb evolution of the models nicely overlaps with the zahb sequence .",
    "the effect is small also for @xmath30k , but , as anticipated , we are not going to use these colors combinations for red hb stars .",
    "also for the ( @xmath31 ) color diagram evolutionary effects are in general negligible .",
    "however they start to be visible below @xmath13k .",
    "the maximum effect is at  in the range between @xmath32 and 7,500k and amounts to @xmath33k .",
    "this represents the maximum systematic error due to evolutionary effects for our individual temperature estimates below 10,000k .    as discussed in detail by @xcite the extinction coefficients for broadband filters may depend on the effective temperature of the stars .",
    "if this is the case , the theoretical color -  relations should be modified to take this into account when applied to the cluster hb stars .",
    "following the methods outlined in @xcite we have verified that for the f170w filter and @xmath34k , the extinction displays a negligible dependence on the temperature , and the same is true for the f255w filter when @xmath25 k. this guarantees that the slopes of the color -  relations that we use do not depend on the individual values of @xmath35 .    finally , for the very rare cases ( in our sample ) of clusters hosting blue - hook stars , which are hotter than the bluest end of any zahb , we will use hot - flashers models as already done for 2808 @xcite .",

    "we estimated a suitable point spread function ( psf ) on the median image through the selection of bright and isolated stars uniformly distributed over the entire chip area . given the stability of the  psf , and since the s / n of the median is higher than that of the single image , we applied the psf model obtained for the former to the latter .",
    "we assumed a quadratic variation of the psf with the position on the frame for all the images but the f160bw and f170w ones , where the limited number of stars restricted our choice to a linearly variable psf model .    for each chip we created two master lists :",

    "we investigated here the most suitable colors for temperature estimates , the effect of metallicity variations , the impact of neglecting off - zahb evolution and also the impact of neglecting differences of he abundances among hb stars on the adopted color -  relations .",
    "as already shown by @xcite and @xcite we found that the ( @xmath66 ) and ( @xmath71 ) color combinations are most sensitive to  variations . however since the sample of red hb stars can be partially incomplete in far - uv bands for some clusters , the use of the ( @xmath79 ) can be considered as a good alternative choice at @xmath25k .",
    "we have shown that variations in metallicity and he have a negligible effect on the zahb color - relations .",
    "moreover we have found that also the effect of gravity due to the off - zahb evolution of hb stars has an almost negligible effect in any color combination for @xmath88k , while at lower temperatures in the ( @xmath31 ) color , it introduces a maximum systematic error of @xmath89 on individual temperatures .",
    "these results fully justify the use of the zahb color -  relations .    as a test case in our analysis ,",
    "we have applied our approach to the metal poor ggc m15 .",
    "we performed a photometric analysis of 20 images centered on the core of the cluster , collected in the filters f160bw , f170w , f255w , f300w , f336w and f555w .",
    "since m15 is the only cluster in our survey for which we have a total filter coverage , it serves as calibrator for our database .",
    "we derived the temperature of m15 hb stars by using the theoretical color -  relation for @xmath67 .",
    "we compared the temperature distributions from the ( @xmath66 ) and ( @xmath21 ) colors , finding a good agreement between the two .",
    "this outcome enables a direct comparison with results already published by our group for clusters with only f160bw observations .",
    "however , since the other clusters in our sample have been observed only in the f170w filter , we adopted the temperature distribution obtained from the ( @xmath71 ) - relation .",
    "moreover , we adopted the temperatures obtained by the ( @xmath90 ) -  for @xmath25k because the completeness of our data is higher in the f255w band for relatively cold stars .",
    "the temperature distribution of the hb stars in m15 is clearly multimodal with a main component peaked at @xmath13k and confined below 10,000k .",
    "the second component is peaked at @xmath2k and it extends up to @xmath91k .",
    "indeed even if the hottest hb star in m15 has been found at @xmath92k , in agreement with @xcite and @xcite , it is important to emphasize that 95% of the hb population in m15 lies below @xmath91k .",
    "we have also shown that the temperature estimates obtained from zahb colors are consistent with previous spectroscopic estimates @xcite .",

    "as specified in the wfpc2 data handbook , the vegamag zero points are referred to the last instrument calibration , which was performed as early as in 2002 .",
    "since the observations presented here were acquired in 2009 ( 7 years after ) the calibrations could be out of date and could not provide anymore a precise calibration of each wfpc2 chip . in order to verify the validity of the adopted calibration we decided to plot different color - magnitude diagrams , using a different color code for stars belonging to the four different chips of the wfpc2 mosaic . in all of them we observed a clear misalignment of the evolutionary sequences both in color and magnitude .",
    "therefore , we devised an empirical procedure for the re - alignment of the magnitudes of the four chips , using as reference the wf3 photometry as our reference catalog .    )",

    "_ right _ : cmd obtained after the pc , wf2 and wf4 magnitudes were manually shifted to match the wf3 ( red points ) sequence . ]",
    "we started by fixing the f170w and the f555w magnitude displacements by re - aligning the rgb / agb and hb sequences observed in the ( @xmath93 ) and ( @xmath94 ) cmds ( see figure  [ fig:170 ] ) . indeed , in these diagrams , the rgb / agb sequence appears as an almost perfect vertical strip of stars , while the red hb appears as a sharp , diagonal sequence in the ( @xmath60 ) cmd and horizontal in the ( @xmath95 ) one @xcite .",
    "hence we were able to determine the corrections to the adopted zero points in the f170w and f555w filters , by shifting in color and/or magnitude the rgb / agb and hb sequences of the pc , wf2 and wf4 in order to match those obtained for the wf3 catalog .",
    "after that , the displacement in @xmath96 were straightforwardly recovered keeping the @xmath97 shift fixed and assuming that the displacement observed in the ( @xmath98 ) cmd , with i = f255w , f300w , f336w , was entirely due to the @xmath99-th filter .",
    "in the case of the f160bw magnitudes ( because of the large calibration uncertainty ) we adopted the best fit zahb model in the ( @xmath100 ) cmd as reference system and the magnitudes obtained for all the wfpc2 chips have bee reported to that reference ."
