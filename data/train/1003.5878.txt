    "chloroform ( chcl@xmath0 ) is a widely used solvent in measurements of nonlinear optical properties of organic chromophores , using techniques such as electric - field - induced second - harmonic generation ( efish ) and hyper - rayleigh scattering ( hrs).@xcite it is sometimes also used as an internal reference.@xcite however , assumptions have to made to extract molecular hyperpolarizabilities from these measurements , in particular from efish which actually measures a third - order response function . for calibration purposes , either absolute measurements or _ ab initio _ calculations",
    "are needed to convert between the different combinations of tensor components of the hyperpolarizability measured in the efish and hrs experiments . however",
    ", very early calculations , which have been recognized as unsatisfactory by their authors,@xcite have heretofore been used for such conversions.@xcite consequently there is a need for better understanding of the convergence issues and for more accurate _",
    "ab initio _ calculations . toward this end we have carried out a systematic study of the second - order hyperpolarizability @xmath1 of chloroform using several theoretical methods . in an effort to obtain high - quality results which improve on earlier calculations , we have based our calculations on an accurate experimental structure and also considered both frequency - dependence and vibrational contributions , effects which are typically neglected in other calculations .",
    "although our presentation is restricted to a single system , the methodology is more general and hence many of our results will likely be applicable to many other cases .",
    "likewise , the quantitative comparison of several theoretical methods is both novel and of general interest .",
    "finally we believe our interpretation of the linear and nonlinear response in terms of local polarizability densities provides a useful way of understanding the local contributions to the polarizability from various parts of a molecule .",
    "chloroform is of particular theoretical interest because its hyperpolarizability is challenging to measure experimentally due its small magnitude compared to typical experimental errors , and hence the available measurements have both positive and negative values , with large error bars.@xcite similarly , this nonlinear property has proved to be quite difficult to calculate theoretically , as the results exhibit a large dependence on the quality of the basis set used , both for dft and coupled - cluster methods,@xcite as well as the molecular geometry .",
    "one of the main purposes of this paper is to investigate the reasons for these difficulties using three different basis set approaches : i ) gaussian - type orbitals ( gtos ) ; ii ) numerical basis sets ; and iii ) real - space grids , all with comparable treatments of exchange and correlation . the importance of different aspects of the basis sets ( diffuseness , polarization , etc . )",
    "was studied systematically by changing the number of gtos , the cutoff radii of the numerical basis sets , and the extent and density of the real - space grids . in order to interpret these results",
    ", we also studied the spatial distribution of the dielectric properties using the concepts of polarizability- and hyperpolarizability - densities , as well as first- and second - order electric - field - perturbed densities.@xcite in addition , we also investigated the dependence of polarization properties on the choice of exchange - correlation ( xc ) functionals and the correlation level by means of dft , hf , mp2 and ccsd methods .",
    "we also briefly discuss the dependence of the results on the molecular geometry , which was found to have a significant influence on the calculated hyperpolarizability .    unless noted explicitly , the experimental molecular geometry of colmont et al.@xcite",
    "was used throughout this work : @xmath2  , @xmath3   and @xmath4@xmath5 .",
    "the molecule was located with its center of mass at the origin , and oriented with the ch bond along the positive @xmath6-direction and one hccl angle in the @xmath7-plane .",
    "since chloroform has c@xmath8 point - group symmetry , the following symmetry relations hold for the linear polarizability @xmath9 and hyperpolarizability @xmath1 : @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in the static case kleinman symmetry@xcite also applies .",
    "thus the @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 components fully describe the polarizability and hyperpolarizability tensors ; all other permutations of the indices are equivalent . in the dynamic case at non - zero frequency , however , the components of @xmath18 are not all equivalent : @xmath19 . here",
    "we use the taylor convention for hyperpolarizabilities.@xcite    from our calculated tensor components we can calculate the isotropically averaged polarizability @xmath20 , the second - order hyperpolarizability coefficient , and the efish hyperpolarizability in the direction of the dipole moment @xmath21 . in the c@xmath8 point group ,",
    "these relations reduce to @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "we also calculate the hyperpolarizability for hyper - rayleigh scattering in the vv polarization , as given by cyvin _ _ et al.__@xcite for the static case ( where kleinman symmetry holds ) and the generalization of bersohn _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite for the dynamic case . in the static case for c@xmath8 symmetry",
    "@xmath24 ^ 2 =      \\frac{8}{35}\\beta_{yyy}^2+\\frac{1}{7}\\beta_{zzz}^2 +      \\frac{24}{35}\\beta_{yyz}^2+\\frac{12}{35}\\beta_{yyz}\\beta_{zzz } . \\ ] ] this quantity has only been measured for liquid chloroform;@xcite measurements are not available for the gas phase .    our best results for each method generally exhibit a consistent agreement among themselves and lend confidence to the overall quality of our calculations compared to earlier work .",
    "achieving this consistency points to the need for a comprehensive and well balanced description of all regions of the system : namely , the outlying regions of the molecule , the short c - h bond , and the cl atoms .",
    "a key finding is that the local contributions to the @xmath17 response of the cl atoms and the c - h bond are of opposite sign and tend to cancel , thus explaining the relatively slow convergence of this component with respect to the basis set size .",
    "this behavior , together with the near cancellation of the @xmath16 and @xmath17 components , leads to the relatively small value of @xmath25 of chloroform .",
    "by contrast , the hrs hyperpolarizability converges much more quickly since it is an incoherent process which is mostly given by a sum of squares of tensor components that do not cancel .",
    "the gto polarization properties were calculated using finite - field perturbation theory ( ffpt ) .",
    "the electric - field strengths @xmath26 used were 0.00 , @xmath270.01 and @xmath270.02 au .",
    "the different components of the induced dipole moment were fit to a 4th - order polynomial to obtain the polarizability and hyperpolarizability tensors . using analytic derivatives available at the hartree - fock level , we find that the properties obtained with the ffpt method agree to 0.1% or better .",
    "the effects of the basis set size and diffuse quality were studied using dunning s double- through quintuple-@xmath28 correlation - consistent sets,@xcite with and without augmentation exponents , and with additional diffuse exponents .",
    "we also used sadlej s hypol basis set,@xcite which is specifically designed for the calculation of nonlinear response properties . in this paper , for simplicity , these basis sets will be referred to as avdz and vdz ( for aug - cc - pvdz and cc - pvdz , respectively ) , avtz and vtz ( for aug - cc - pvtz and cc - pvtz ) , etc .",
    "the hypol set will be abbreviated as hp .",
    "the basis set labeled av5zs corresponds to the av5z set , where the @xmath29 and @xmath30 functions were removed from the c and cl atoms and the @xmath31 and @xmath29 were removed from the h atom .",
    "the d - av5zs basis set corresponds to the av5zs set augmented with ( 0.014184 , 0.009792 , 0.025236 ) and ( 0.017244 , 0.012528 , 0.036108 ) ( @xmath32,@xmath33,@xmath34 ) exponents on the c and cl atoms , respectively and ( 0.004968 , 0.026784 ) ( @xmath32,@xmath33 ) exponents on the h atom .    throughout this paper , unless otherwise specified , we use hartree atomic units @xmath35 with distances in bohr ( @xmath36 0.529  ) and energies in hartrees @xmath37 27.2 ev .",
    "the effect of electron correlation on these all - electron calculations was studied with the lda,@xcite pbe,@xcite b3lyp,@xcite and bmk@xcite exchange - correlation density functionals , as well as with the hf , mp2 and ccsd methods .",
    "other xc functionals , such as the cam - b3lyp functional,@xcite have been used for hyperpolarizability calculations , but we have not included them since they have not shown a systematic improvement with respect to ccsd.@xcite all gto calculations were performed with gaussian 03.@xcite      for the real - space grid calculations we used _",
    "ab initio _ density - functional theory with a real - space basis , as implemented in octopus.@xcite the polarizability and hyperpolarizability were calculated by linear response via the sternheimer equation and the @xmath38 theorem.@xcite this approach , also known as density - functional perturbation theory , avoids the need for sums over unoccupied states .",
    "the pbe exchange - correlation functional was used for the ground state , and the adiabatic lda kernel was used for the linear response .",
    "all calculations used troullier - martins norm - conserving pseudopotentials.@xcite    the molecule was studied as a finite system , with zero boundary conditions for the wavefunction on a large sphere surrounding the molecule , as described below .",
    "convergence was tested with respect to the real - space grid spacing and the radius of the spherical domain .",
    "the grid spacing required is determined largely by the pseudopotential , as it governs the fineness with which spatial variations of the wavefunctions can be described as well as the accuracy of the finite - difference evaluation of the kinetic - energy operator .",
    "the spacing @xmath39 can be converted to an equivalent plane - wave cutoff via @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the cutoff energy for both the charge density and wavefunctions .",
    "the sphere radius determines the maximum spatial extent of the wavefunctions .    with tight numerical tolerances in solving the kohn - sham and sternheimer equations",
    ", we can achieve a precision of 0.01 au or better in the converged values of the tensor components of @xmath1 .",
    "we also did two additional kinds of calculations .",
    "for comparison to the nonlinear experiments , which used incoming photons of wavelength 1064 nm ( energy 1.165 ev ) , we also performed dynamical calculations at this frequency via time - dependent density - functional theory ( tddft ) . to compare directly to the results from finite - field perturbation theory with the other basis sets , we also calculated the dielectric properties via finite differences using electric - field strengths of @xmath270.01 and @xmath270.015 au .",
    "the numerical basis set ( nbs ) calculations were performed with the siesta@xcite code and used troullier - martins norm - conserving pseudopotentials.@xcite as in the gto calculations described in section [ subsec : meth : gtos ] , the polarization properties were obtained using ffpt with electric - field strengths of 0.00 , @xmath270.01 and @xmath270.02 au .",
    "the nbss use a generic linear combination of numerical atomic orbitals ( naos ) that are forced to be zero beyond a cutoff radius @xmath42.@xcite rather than using a fixed @xmath42 for all atoms , a common confinement - energy shift is usually enforced , resulting in well - balanced basis sets.@xcite in general , multiple radial functions with the same angular dependence are introduced to enhance the flexibility of the basis set .",
    "this results in a so - called multiple-@xmath28 scheme similar to the standard split - valence approach used for gtos.@xcite polarization functions can also be added using the approach described in ref . .",
    "typically , double-@xmath28 sets with a single polarization function ( dzp ) are sufficient in linear - response calculations .",
    "however , we found that a dzp set is insufficient for nonlinear properties . instead of performing an optimization of the nbss",
    ", we improved their flexibility by adding @xmath28-functions , and controlling their splitting.@xcite by varying the `` norm - splitting '' parameter in siesta , we can control the flexibility in different regions of the radial functions , resulting in the cutoff radii and energy shifts shown in tables [ tbl : numbas ] and [ tbl : numbas2 ] .",

    "as defined above depend on the origin of coordinates . throughout this work we chose a center - of - mass reference for the spatial distributions . to understand the role that different regions of the molecule play in the total properties , we have devised a partitioning scheme for the spatial distribution corresponding to the spaces",

    "that is , we divide space into two regions by constructing three planes , each orthogonal to one of the c - cl bonds , and passing through a point located 40% along the c - cl bond from the c atom , which corresponds approximately to the density minimum along the c - cl bond .",

    "however , we find that the tight @xmath34 functions change the individual components by only about 0.3% and @xmath25 by only about 2% .",
    "finally , we find that the hypol basis set , which is approximately equivalent in size to the avtz set , yields results that are equivalent to the much larger d - av5zs set .",
    "this basis set was designed with the explicit purpose of efficiently calculating nonlinear properties .",
    "thus it is not surprising that it provides converged results for a smaller size .",
    "the large variations in @xmath25 are due largely to changes in @xmath17 , for which completing the basis set produces a change of sign and an absolute change of nearly two orders of magnitude .",
