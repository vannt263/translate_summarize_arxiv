    "the physical origin of newly discovered fast radio bursts ( frbs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is debated @xcite .",
    "one attractive proposal is delayed collapses of supra - massive neutron stars after loosing centrifugal support due to spin down @xcite .",
    "@xcite recently suggested that within such a scenario , a small fraction of frbs can be physically associated with some gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , whose central engine is a supra - massive millisecond magnetar , which collapses into a black hole after the grb prompt emission is over ( @xmath2 s ) .",
    "such a frb / grb association might have been detected in grb 101011a and grb 100704a by @xcite . if such frb / grb associations are confirmed to be common , it opens a new window to study cosmology .",
    "this letter discusses the cosmological implications of such associations .",
    "for an frb / grb association system , one can in principle get two precise measurements .",
    "one is the redshift of the system , which can be measured from the emission lines of the grb host galaxies or absorption lines of the grb afterglows .",
    "the second is the dispersion measure ( dm ) of the system measured from the frb . in general , the dm is defined as the delayed arrival time of a radio wave with respect to the arrival time in vacuum , i.e. @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 hz is the plasma frequency , and dm is normalized to a typical value @xmath5 for the intergalactic medium ( igm ) to a source at a cosmological distance . practically it is measured from the time delay between two frequencies . for a plasma at redshift @xmath6 , the rest - frame delay time ( @xmath7 ) between two rest - frame frequencies ( @xmath8 ) is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the rest - frame dispersion measure , which is just the column density of free electrons at the source . in the observer frame ,",
    "the observed delay time is @xmath11 and the observed frequency is @xmath12 .",
    "so eq.([eq : delta_t_z ] ) can be modified as @xmath13 where the measured dm by an earth observer is @xmath14    for an frb / grb system , the measured dm should include four terms : @xmath15 they denote dispersion measure contributions from the milky way , intergalactic medium , grb host galaxy , and the grb blastwave itself , respectively .",
    "the observed @xmath16 of frbs are around several hundreds @xmath17 @xcite , and the two putative frbs associated with two grbs also have similar values of dms @xcite . in the following",
    "we discuss the relative importance of the four terms in turn .",
    "@xmath18 is well constrained with the pulsar data @xcite , and is a strong decreasing function of galactic latitude @xmath20 , from @xmath21 when @xmath22 to @xmath23 at @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the observed frbs all have relatively large @xmath20 , so @xmath18 is a relatively small term .",
    "@xmath19 is poorly known .",
    "if grbs are born in giant molecular clouds , @xmath19 may be very large @xcite .",
    "afterglow studies of grbs seem to suggest that the grb circumburst density is relatively low , with a typical value of @xmath25 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "considering that the grb host galaxies are typically smaller than milky way @xcite and the additional @xmath26 deduction factor ( eq.([eq : dmz ] ) ) , it would be reasonable to assume that on average @xmath27 may be anomalously high , probably due to the existence of a dense thick electronic disk viewed near the edge - on direction .",
    "such outliers can be easily recognized , and can be excluded for cosmological studies discussed in this paper . ] .",
    "a grb - associated frb would happen at the end of the x - ray plateau phase ( or somewhat later ) , which could be the time when the supramassive neutron star collapses into a black hole @xcite .",
    "as the frb is ejected at an inner radius @xmath29 cm , the blastwave is already at a large radius @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the delay time between the frb and the grb .",
    "the frb , traveling essentially with speed of light , would catch up with the blastwave at a radius @xmath32 ^ 2 r_2 \\gg r_2 $ ] . at this radius ,",
    "the plasma frequency is much lower than the frb frequency , so that the frb can go through the blastwave @xcite . in any case",
    ", the blastwave would contribute to the frequency dispersion , which we calculate below .",
    "one important parameter is the baryon loading parameter of the grb , which may be characterized as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the initial mass loading in the grb outflow , and @xmath35 is the isotropic energy of the grb , which is the sum of the isotropic energy released in @xmath36-rays ( prompt phase ) , in x - rays as internal emission ( during the internal plateau ) , and the isotropic kinetic energy that powers the afterglow emission ( the normal plateau ) @xcite",
    ". for frb - associated grbs , there should be energy injection in the early afterglow phase @xcite , so the kinetic energy @xmath37 should be calculated after energy injection is over .",
    "the parameter @xmath38 is therefore the final `` effective '' initial lorentz factor of the outflow .",
    "it reflects the average baryon - loading parameter @xmath39 ( @xmath40 is the dimensionless entropy , and @xmath41 is the initial magnetization parameter at the central engine ) @xcite .",
    "the radius at which the frb catches up the blastwave also depends on the density profile of the circumburst medium , which could be either a constant density medium with @xmath42 ( @xmath43 is the number density of protons / electrons ) or a stellar wind with @xmath44 ( @xmath45 is the wind parameter ) .    at late phase of blastwave propagation ( much later than the energy injection phase ) , which is relevant for frb catching up with the blastwave , the energy conservation equation can be written as @xmath46 , \\label{eq : gamma}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the mass accumulated from the circumburst medium , which is @xmath48 for ism , and @xmath49 for wind",
    ".    the catching up condition can be more rigorously written as @xmath50 using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) and ( [ eq : r3 ] ) , one can solve for @xmath51 for different initial parameters . since the thickness @xmath52 of the blastwave is @xmath53 , one can calculate @xmath28 in the observer frame as @xmath54/m_{\\rm p}}{(1+z ) \\pi",

    "we get @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 ; for the wind case , we get @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",

    "table : dm_grb ] , we vary each input parameter ( @xmath71 , @xmath38 , @xmath31 , and @xmath72 ) to a wider range and recalculate the @xmath55 values . in particular , we incorporate more extreme parameters @xcite in favor of large @xmath28 values .",
    "the general result is that @xmath55 is much less than @xmath16 detected from frbs , and in most cases even smaller than @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "correcting for the @xmath26 factor ( eq.([eq : dmz ] ) ) , the value is even smaller . for parameter dependences , @xmath55 is larger for a larger mass loading ( smaller @xmath38 ) , shorter time delay @xmath31 ( so that the frb catches up with the blastwave at a smaller radius ) , or a higher ambient density @xmath43 or @xmath73 ( again a smaller catch - up radius ) .",
    "the effect of isotropic energy @xmath71 is mixed : it increases baryon loading ( given a same @xmath38 ) but also increases catch - up radius by increasing deceleration radius .",

    "another issue is that the @xmath1 measured for different lines of sights may fluctuate , and the scattering effect would introduce biases in frb - grb sample selection @xcite . studying a large sample of frb / grb systems over a wide redshift range can give a more reliable averaged value of @xmath1 .    within the frb / grb association picture ,",
