    "this paper concerns the theory of constant mean curvature ( _ cmc _ for short ) surfaces @xmath3 in @xmath1 .",
    "the value @xmath3 is critical in the sense that there is no compact cmc surface for @xmath4 while for @xmath5 there are rotational compact examples .",
    "a half - space theorem in @xmath1 ( see @xcite ) proves that for cmc @xmath3 , complete multigraphs are entire graphs over @xmath2 .",
    "entire graphs are classified by i.  fernndez and p.  mira @xcite and their moduli space is modeled on the set of quadratic holomorphic differential @xmath6 defined on the complex plane @xmath7 or the unit disk @xmath8 .",
    "the link between @xmath6 and the geometry of the graph is not very well understood .",
    "we first deal with complete conformal immersions of the disk @xmath8 , properly immersed into the half - space @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , which are entire vertical graphs over @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that the third coordinate @xmath11 on any diverging sequence of points in @xmath8 , which means the height function is proper .",
    "up to this date , the only simply connected example is a rotational example called the _ hyperboloid _ @xmath12 . in the poincar disk model of @xmath1",
    "  see   below   with polar coordinates @xmath13 , a parametrization of @xmath12 as a graph over @xmath2 is : @xmath14    we describe a family of examples endowed with a structure of infinite dimensional smooth manifold .",
    "the manifold structure arises from a suitable _ compactification _ of the mean curvature operator at infinity ( theorem  [ thm : compcourb ] ) and is diffeomorphic to a codimension one submanifold of @xmath15 ( theorem  [ thm : structg ] ) .",
    "this construction comes with a control of the asymptotic behavior in terms of the horizontal ( hyperbolic ) distance from the hyperboloid @xmath12 , namely :    for any small @xmath16 such that @xmath17 has unit @xmath18-norm , there exists a cmc-@xmath0 complete entire graph at asymptotic horizontal signed distance @xmath19 from @xmath12 .",
    "these graphs are interesting , since any connected complete embedded cmc-@xmath0 surface in @xmath1 which is contained in the half - space @xmath9 and has a proper height function is a vertical entire graph .",
    "indeed , apply alexandrov reflection principle to such an immersion with respect to the horizontal slices .",
    "namely , reflect through the slice the part of the surface situated below it to obtain a surface which is a bigraph i.e. a graph over each side of the slice",
    ". there will be no first point of tangent contact between the initial surface and the part of the bigraph which is not a part of the surface , since there is no compact cmc-@xmath0 surface in @xmath1 .",
    "we also prove a half - space property for these entire graphs :    let @xmath20 be a cmc-@xmath0 surface which is properly immersed in @xmath1 , lies on one side of a cmc-@xmath0 entire graph @xmath21 in the aforementioned family and is well oriented with respect to @xmath21",
    ". then @xmath20 coincides with @xmath21 up to a vertical translation .",
    "the `` well oriented '' assumption is in the sense of l.  mazet @xcite and means that if @xmath20 is below @xmath21 , its mean curvature vector points to @xmath21 .",
    "we use this result to show an asymptotic rigidity in our family of cmc-@xmath0 entire graphs ( theorem  [ thm : rigidinf ] ) .",
    "namely , if two graphs in the family are at the same asymptotic horizontal signed distance from the hyperboloid @xmath12 , they coincide up to a vertical translation .    in @xmath1 ,",
    "r.  s  earp and e.  toubiana @xcite construct a one - parameter family of cmc @xmath3 annuli which are rotationally invariant around a vertical geodesic .",
    "recently , l.  mazet has shown @xcite that for @xmath5 , cmc annuli which are cylindrically bounded around a vertical geodesic are rotational examples .",
    "though annuli are not cylindrically bounded for @xmath3 , we prove that in a bounded tubular neighborhood of a rotational example , there are annuli , eventually embedded , which are asymptotic to different rotational examples with different axis :    there exist cmc-@xmath0 annuli in @xmath1 with vertical ends , that are asymptotic   regarding the horizontal hyperbolic distance   to rotational examples with different vertical axis .",
    "it means that contrary to the case of embedded minimal surfaces in @xmath22 with finite total curvature and horizontal ends @xcite , the notion of _ axis _ is not relevant in general for cmc-@xmath0 annuli with vertical ends in @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath23 |z| < 1 \\rac$ ] be the open unit disk , @xmath24 |z| \\leq 1 \\rac$ ] its closure and @xmath13 the polar coordinates on @xmath25 .",
    "we use two standard models of @xmath1 , which are the minkowski model : @xmath26 where @xmath1 is seen as a subspace of the @xmath27-dimensional minkowski space @xmath28 , and the poincar disk model : @xmath29 the vector field associated to the third coordinate is denoted @xmath30 . in the poincar disk model  ,",
    "the hyperbolic radius @xmath31 of a point @xmath32 is : @xmath33 and we will need the following formula in the proof of proposition  [ prop : graphdeform ] : @xmath34 we call vertical graphs in @xmath1 , immersions which are complete graphs over an open subset of the slice @xmath35 , and we call vertical annuli in @xmath1 , immersions which are complete vertical bigraphs .    given surfaces @xmath36 in @xmath1 admitting parametrizations in the poincar disk model respectively : @xmath37 the hyperbolic horizontal signed distance @xmath38 between @xmath21 and @xmath39 at height @xmath40 and in the direction @xmath41 is the difference of their hyperbolic radii in the slice @xmath42 and direction @xmath41 : @xmath43 when it exists , the _ asymptotic hyperbolic horizontal signed distance _ between @xmath21 and @xmath39 in the direction @xmath41 is the limit @xmath44 .    for any @xmath45 ,",
    "let @xmath46 be the domain @xmath47 .",
    "we consider the set of _ admissible domains _ @xmath48 .",
    "the boundary at infinity @xmath49 of @xmath2 is identified with @xmath50 .",
    "given @xmath51 , the spaces @xmath52 and @xmath53 , with @xmath54 and @xmath55 , are respectively the usual hlder space and the subspace of functions that are zero on the boundary of @xmath56 .",
    "finally , we consider the spaces @xmath57 endowed with the natural scalar product denoted @xmath58 and hilbert norm @xmath59 .",
    "consider a surface @xmath21 parametrized by an immersion @xmath60 with complete induced metric @xmath61 . by _ compactification _ of @xmath21 , we mean a conformal change @xmath62 of metric such that @xmath62 extends to a metric on @xmath25 .",
    "the process is sensible to the parametrization .",
    "for instance , consider the hyperboloid @xmath12 .",
    "it is a vertical graph over @xmath2 parametrized by : @xmath63 in the poincar disk model  , with induced metric : @xmath64 but @xmath61 can not be conformally extended to the boundary @xmath65 of @xmath8 , since the terms of @xmath61 have different rates of explosion when @xmath66 .",
    "the resulting metric would degenerate for @xmath67 .    to ensure the extension of the induced metric",
    ", we use a conformal parametrization @xmath12 , namely the immersion @xmath68 defined by : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the @xmath71-diffeomorphism defined in the poincar disk model   by : @xmath72 and in the minkowski model   by : @xmath73    a surface in @xmath1 is said to _ admit graph coordinates at infinity _ , if there exist an admissible domain @xmath51 and a function @xmath74 such that a part of the surface can be parametrized as the immersion on @xmath56 : @xmath75 when defined , we call such a parametrization _ graph coordinates at infinity_.    in the sequel , we use graph coordinates at infinity to compactify surfaces and quantify their asymptotic behavior .",
    "surfaces are thus considered as _ compact surfaces with boundary _ and we can apply the method first developed by b.  white in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath76 be the set of immersed surfaces in @xmath1 , which admit   up to a symmetry with respect to the slice @xmath77   graph coordinates at infinity written as : @xmath78 for some admissible domain @xmath51 and @xmath79 .",
    "elements of @xmath76 have _ vertical ends _ @xcite i.e. topological annuli with no asymptotic point at finite height   i.e. topological annuli properly embedded in @xmath80 .",
    "the hyperboloid @xmath12 itself is in @xmath76 with @xmath81 and @xmath82 . and so are the rotational examples of e.  toubiana and r.  s  earp studied in section  [ sec : ann ] , owing the asymptotic development  .",
    "we highlight two properties of the family @xmath76 .",
    "the first is that it contains normal deformations of the hyperboloid @xmath12 .",
    "namely :    [ prop : graphdeform ]    a normal graph @xmath83 over @xmath12 , where @xmath84 is the upward pointing normal to @xmath12 and @xmath85 , is in @xmath76 . in other words , there exist @xmath51 and @xmath79 such that the end of @xmath21 admits graph coordinates at infinity as in  .",
    "+ furthermore , the asymptotic value of @xmath86 is linked with the asymptotic horizontal ( hyperbolic ) distance between @xmath21 and @xmath12 : @xmath87    we use the minkowski model   of @xmath1 , where the map @xmath88 reads : @xmath73 a computation shows the unit normal @xmath84 to @xmath12 is : @xmath89 in the canonical basis of @xmath28 .",
    "hence , @xmath21 is parametrized by the immersion : @xmath90 we want to find new coordinates @xmath91 on an admissible domain verifying : @xmath92 to have graph coordinates at infinity on @xmath21 as in  .",
    "taking @xmath93 , compute : @xmath94 if @xmath95 is sufficiently close to @xmath96 , the map @xmath97 is strictly increasing ( uniformly in @xmath41 ) , which ensures existence and uniqueness of @xmath98 .    to compute the asymptotic horizontal distance , consider a horizontal slice @xmath42 intersecting @xmath21 and @xmath12 .",
    "the hyperbolic radii of @xmath21 and @xmath12 at height @xmath40 and in the direction @xmath41 respectively denoted @xmath99 and @xmath100 verify : @xmath101 and we deduce : @xmath102 therefore , the hyperbolic horizontal signed distance @xmath103 between @xmath21 and @xmath12 at height @xmath40 and in the direction @xmath41 is : @xmath104 which establishes the equality @xmath105 at infinity .",
    "indeed , @xmath106 is the normal signed distance between @xmath21 and @xmath12 at infinity as @xmath21 is constructed as a normal graph over @xmath12 at signed distance @xmath107 .",
    "and @xmath106 is also the horizontal distance at infinity , since the normal @xmath84 is asymptotically horizontal , which means @xmath108 .",
    "proposition  [ prop : graphdeform ] emphasizes the fact that the relevant information at infinity is the asymptotic horizontal distance from the hyperboloid . and as suggested by   in section  [ sec : ann ] , the asymptotic horizontal distance is also relevant for deformed annuli , since the rotational examples are at a finite constant asymptotic horizontal distance from each other .",
    "therefore a general principle in this paper is to fix a convenient surface , the _ model surface _ , and to construct deformations of the model surface prescribing the asymptotic horizontal distance from the model surface .",
    "it is also the supporting idea of the compactification of the mean curvature operator ( theorem  [ thm : compcourb ] ) .",
    "a second interesting property of @xmath76 is the following :    [ prop : invisom ]    the image of any element of @xmath76 under the action of any isometry of @xmath1 is still an element of @xmath76 .",
    "consider a surface @xmath109 with graph coordinates at infinity @xmath110 defined on @xmath51 , and denote by @xmath111 the graph coordinates at infinity of its image @xmath39 under an isometry @xmath112 of @xmath1 .",
    "using parametrization  , we know that in the poincar disk model  : @xmath113 it is sufficient to examine the cases when @xmath112 is either an isometry of @xmath2 fixing the coordinate @xmath114 or a vertical translation . if @xmath112 is a vertical translation of @xmath115 , we have : @xmath116 eventually after a restriction to a domain @xmath117 for which @xmath118 .",
    "if @xmath112 reduces to an isometry of @xmath2 preserving the orientation of @xmath2 , there exist @xmath119 and @xmath120 such that : @xmath121 if @xmath122 , then : @xmath123 and @xmath124 . changing @xmath88 in @xmath125 ,",
    "gives the result when @xmath112 reduces to an isometry of @xmath2 reversing the orientation .",
