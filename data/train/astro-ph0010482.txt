    "absorption is often detected in compact / small radio galaxies .",
    "indeed , the scale of the radio continuum in these objects represents an effective background against which the absorption can be observed .",
    "although the absorption is often interpreted as due to the presence of a nuclear torus / disk , the situation can be more complicated in some ( or perhaps many ) cases .",
    "for example , extended regions of ionised gas have been imaged around compact radio galaxies ( e.g. with hst , see axon et al .",
    "if this gas is also a tracer of the neutral gas , this means that  absorption can also be produced in the regions around the radio lobes and not only against the nucleus .",
    "moreover , compact radio galaxies ( e.g.  compact steep spectrum sources ) are known to have broad ( forbidden ) optical emission lines likely due to turbulent motions as result of the interaction between the radio plasma and the ism ( gelderman & whittle 1994 ) .",
    "this process may `` pile up '' gas at the edge of the lobes , thus making the detection of  absorption more likely ( see e.g.  ic  5063 , oosterloo et al .",
    "2000 ) . in some cases",
    "( although a minority ) star formation and far - ir emission are observed .",
    "thus , these objects could have a particularly rich ism that could produce the absorption in / around their radio lobes .",
    "a further complication in the interpretation of the  absorption is the uncertainty in the values of the systemic velocity as obtained from optical data . to unambiguously interpret the kinematics of the neutral gas , better systemic velocities than available in literature are usually necessary .",
    "we have recently carried out ( with the vla and the atca ) a survey looking for hi absorption in radio galaxies : 23 galaxies have been observed so far ( morganti et al .",
    "two of them are compact radio galaxies and show  absorption ( pks 154979 and pks 181463 ) .",
    "thus , they have been followed up with high resolution observations with the australian lba .",
    "pks  154979 is a relatively unusual galaxy . at radio wavelengths , it is a compact flat spectrum source ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) with a one - sided jet on the vlbi scale .",
    "the radio structure seems to indicate that the radio jet axis is aligned with our line of sight .",
    "the size is 150 mas , about 350 pc .",
    "mpc@xmath2 and @xmath3 . ] because of these characteristics , it was quite surprising to detect  absorption in this object .",
    "pks 154979 has a redshift of @xmath4 and was therefore observed at 1235  mhz , the frequency of the redshifted . at this relatively low frequency",
    "we could use only three telescopes parkes ( 64 m ) , ca ( tied array , 5x22 m ) and mopra ( 22 m ) .",
    "the latter had technical problems so data on only one baseline was left .",
    "the observations were done using 8  mhz band , 512 channels ( @xmath5  velocity resolution ) .",
    "the  profile is shown in fig.1 .",
    "the total of the line is @xmath6 and the peak optical depth is about 2% . the column density is @xmath7 @xmath8 .",
    "a high quality optical spectrum was taken ( see tadhunter et al .",
    "2000a for details ) to allow an accurate comparison between the velocities derived from the optical lines ( ionised gas ) and from the .",
    "the spectrum of pks  154979 is characterised by high ionisation `` narrow '' emission lines with _ no evidence for broad permitted lines _ ( quite unusual for a flat spectrum radio source ) .",
    "surprisingly , _ two redshift systems _ were found in the optical : the higher ionisation lines ( e.g.  [ oiii]5007 ) have a significant lower redshift ( velocity difference of @xmath9 , see fig .",
    "1 ) than the low ionisation lines ( e.g.  [ oii]3727 ) .",
    "the _ high ionisation forbidden line _ are also unusually broad ( 1345 ) .",
    "_ interestingly , the velocity derived from the low ionisation lines is consistent with the one derived from the _ .",
    "pks  154979 is also one of the few known radio galaxies at low redshift which shows ( in the optical continuum ) a strong component from young stellar population .",
    "this is confirmed also by the strong far - ir emission detected by the iras satellite ( roy & norris 1997 ) .    the likely scenario of what is going on in pks  154979 , in order to explain _ all _ the observed characteristics , is summarised in the cartoon in fig .   1 .",
    "pks  154979 is a _ young _ source where the nucleus is surrounded by a cocoon of material left over from the events which triggered the nuclear activity .",
    "the high ionisation lines are formed in a region close to the central agn , which is undergoing outflow because of interactions , e.g. , with the radio jet , while the low ionisation lines are formed in a obscuring region at larger distance and not so disturbed kinematically .",
    "as the radio source evolves , any obscuring material along the jet axis is likely to be swept aside by , e.g. , jet - cloud interactions . before this stage",
    "is reached a substantial amount of obscuring material may be present along the radio axis .",
    "a major implication of this work is that the simplest version of the unified schemes , in which lines of sight close to the radio axis have a relatively unobscured view of the quasar nucleus , _ may not always hold for young , compact radio sources in which the jets and quasar winds have not yet swept aside the warm ism in the ionisation cones_.    although the characteristics observed in pks  154979 may not be very common among radio galaxies , we have found at least an other object with remarkable similarities : the compact radio source 4c  12.30 ( pks  1345 + 12 ) .",
    "pks  181463 is a compact steep spectrum ( css ) source with a basic double - lobed structure oriented almost north - south ( tzioumis et al .",
    "the radio spectral index on the vlbi scale is not yet available for this galaxy , thus , no information is available on which of these structures ( if any ) corresponds to the core .",
    "the overall extent of the source is 410 mas corresponding to 328 pc .",
    "with atca  absorption was detected that shows a deep profile ( @xmath1020 % optical depth ) together with a broad , shallow feature ( morganti et al .",
    "pks  181463 has a redshift of @xmath11 and was observed with the australian lba at 1336  mhz using parkes , ca ( tied array ) , mopra , hobart with the same setup as for pks  154979 .    the results are shown in fig .  2 . the deep absorption appears extended in the vlbi data and is detected against most of the source with the exception of the southern part of the southern lobe .",
    "the peak optical depth goes from @xmath12% in the southern lobe to @xmath10 10% in the northern region .",
    "the component with lower optical depth ( ranging between 2 and 4% ) is observed _ only _ against the northern region .",
    "the optical spectra available for this object are not very good .",
    "the systemic velocity marked in the plots ( @xmath13 ) is derived from re - analysing the optical spectrum presented in tadhunter et al .",
    "this velocity will have to be confirmed by better quality data .",
    "however , as it stands now , most of the  absorption , and in particular the deep component , is blueshifted compared to the systemic velocity . only the component with low optical depth observed against the northern region",
    "has a velocity close to the systemic velocity as derived from the available data .",
    "thus , one possibility to explain these characteristics is that the shallow component is the one associated with a circumnuclear disk while the deeper component ( observed against most of the radio source ) could be instead associated with more extended gas , possibly surrounding the lobes and perhaps interacting / expanding with them ( if the blueshifted velocity is confirmed ) .",
    "in both the radio galaxies studied , the  appears to give us information about the environment in which the radio sources are embedded , the effect that the ism can have on the observed characteristics and the possible presence of interaction between the ism and the radio plasma .",
    "absorption occurring around radio lobes and/or related to interaction between the radio plasma and the ism is indeed found in a growing number of radio sources .",
    "an extreme case of interaction has been found in the seyfert galaxy ic  5063 where very broad ( @xmath10700 )  absorption , blueshifted with respect to the systemic velocity has been observed coincident with a radio lobe ( oosterloo et al .",
    "other possible evidence for interaction between the radio plasma and the ism has been found in at least two radio galaxies : the superluminal object 3c 216 ( pihlstrm et al .",
    "1999 ) and 3c 326 ( conway et al .",
    "these proceedings ) .",
    "moreover , on even larger scale ( @xmath14 10 kpc ) ,  absorption against the radio lobes has been found in the radio galaxy coma  a ( morganti et al .",
    "2000b ) as well as in the radio galaxy 3c  433 . in coma",
    "a , the striking structure of the ionised gas strongly suggests the presence of a complex interaction between the radio structure and the gas around ( tadhunter et al .",
    "2000b ) while 3c  433 is an other example of starburst and far - ir bright radio galaxies ) .",
    "if the  absorption is observed against the lobes of relatively large galaxies situated in a relatively rich environment , this situation could be even more common for compact radio sources .",
    "thus , the study of the  absorption can tell us about the role of the ism in the evolution of the sources as well as help in understanding the relation between intrinsic distribution of the gas and ionised gas .",
    "moreover , it can give us clues on the ionisation mechanisms ."
