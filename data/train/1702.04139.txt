    "<S> we consider the possibility that the reactor antineutrino anomaly is due to a miscalculation of one or more of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 reactor antineutrino fluxes . from the fit of the data we obtain the precise determination @xmath4 of the @xmath0 cross section per fission , which is more precise than the calculated value and differs from it by @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the cross sections per fission of the other fluxes have large uncertainties and in practice their values are undetermined by the fit . we conclude that it is very likely that at least the calculation of the @xmath0 flux must be revised .    </S>",
    "<S> the reactor antineutrino anomaly @xcite is due to the 2011 recalculation @xcite of the reactor antineutrino flux , which is about 3% higher than the previous estimate @xcite and implies a deficit of the rate of @xmath6 observed in several reactor neutrino experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> it is possible that the reactor antineutrino anomaly is due to the oscillations of the reactor @xmath6 s into sterile neutrinos with a mass at the ev scale ( see the review in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . however , it is also possible that the reactor antineutrino anomaly is due to a flaw in the calculation of one or more of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 fluxes that compose the reactor antineutrino flux . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we consider this second possibility and we investigate which of the four fluxes could be the cause of the reactor antineutrino anomaly @xcite .    the prime suspect as a cause for the reactor antineutrino anomaly is the @xmath0 antineutrino flux , because some of the experiments which observed a deficit of electron antineutrinos used research reactors , which produce an almost pure @xmath0 antineutrino flux . </S>",
    "<S> however , since other experiments used commercial reactors with significant contributions of the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 electron antineutrino fluxes , a detailed calculation is necessary in order to reach a definite and quantitative conclusion .    the theoretical prediction for the event rate of an experiment labeled with the index @xmath7 is usually expressed by the cross section per fission @xmath8 , with @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath10 is the antineutrino flux fraction from the fission of the isotope with atomic mass @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the corresponding cross section per fission , which is given by the integrated product of the antineutrino flux and the detection cross section .    </S>",
    "<S> the cross sections per fission of the four fissile isotopes calculated by the saclay group in ref .  </S>",

    "<S> these values must be increased by 1.2% , 1.4% , and 1.0% for @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , respectively , according to the improved inversion of the ill electron spectra of huber @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the fit of the data in table  [ tab : rat ] gives @xmath17 with @xmath18 degrees of freedom , which correspond to an excellent @xmath19 goodness of fit . on the other hand , the null hypothesis ( all @xmath20 ) has @xmath21 with @xmath22 degrees of freedom , which corresponds to a disastrous goodness of fit .    </S>",

    "<S> one can see that the values of @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 are not sharply constrained : they are compatible with unity , but significantly different values are allowed . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath28 is sharply determined by the data : @xmath29 this value of the @xmath0 cross section per fission must be compared with the calculated value in table  [ tab : csf ] : @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath31 obtained from the fit has an uncertainty that is smaller than the uncertainty of @xmath32 . adding the two uncertainties quadratically </S>",
    "<S> , there is a discrepancy of @xmath33 between the two values .    </S>",
    "<S> however , one can question the reliability of the calculation above by noting that the large deviations from unity of the best - fit values @xmath34 and @xmath35 , are excessive for a physical explanation . </S>",
    "<S> in order to restrict the values of @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 to reasonable intervals around unity , we use the least - squares function @xmath36 taking into account the 5% uncertainty of the reactor neutrino flux recently advocated in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we consider @xmath37 , and we slightly increase the large uncertainty of @xmath25 in table  [ tab : csf ] by considering @xmath38 . </S>",
