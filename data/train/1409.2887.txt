    "the main quasar sample of this study is drawn from the sdss dr7 quasar catalog ( 6 ) , which contains more than 20,000 quasars at @xmath38 for which the h@xmath1-  region is covered in the sdss spectra .",
    "we use the improved redshift estimates ( 28 ) for these sdss quasars .",
    "our sdss quasar sample probes a redshift range @xmath39 and a luminosity range of @xmath40 , where we adopt a flat @xmath41cdm cosmology with @xmath42 and @xmath43 throughout .",
    "we measure the continuum and emission - line properties for , h@xmath1  and  using functional fits to the spectra .",
    "the details of the spectral fits are described in early work ( 7 , 29 ) . in short , several continuum windows around the spectral region of h@xmath1-",
    "is fit by a power - law continuum plus a  template ( 1 ) to form a pseudo - continuum ; this pseudo - continuum is subtracted from the spectrum , leaving an emission - line - only spectrum .",
    "a set of gaussians is then fit to the broad and narrow emission lines .",
    "the narrow - line component of h@xmath1  is modelled using constraints from the narrow  lines ; we fix the offset and line width of narrow h@xmath1  to those of the narrow [ oiii]@xmath444959 , 5007  doublet . in cases where the  doublet shows a prominent blueshifted wing , we fit [ oiii]@xmath04959  and [ oiii]@xmath05007  with double gaussians , one for the core component and the other for the wing component .",
    "narrow h@xmath1  is then tied to the core  component .",
    "the broad h@xmath1  component is fit with three gaussians .",
    "in addition , we fit two gaussians to account for the narrow and broad heii @xmath04686 .",
    "we determine the line fwhm and rest - frame equivalent width ( ew ) for broad h@xmath1  and [ oiii]@xmath05007 , as well as the rest - frame ew of the optical  emission within 4434 - 4684   . as common practice",
    ", we use the ratio , @xmath45 , to indicate the strength of the optical  emission . for other emission lines",
    ", the term `` strength '' refers to the rest - frame ew ( or line luminosity normalized by the continuum luminosity ) , unless otherwise specified .",
    "the spectral decomposition generates the emission - line - only spectra ( i.e. , with the pseudo - continuum removed ) and the narrow - line - only spectra ( i.e. , with both the pseudo - continuum and the broad h@xmath1  component removed ) , with which we create stacked spectra binned in quasar properties .",
    "here we summarize all the quasar properties that correlate with the ev1 , using our large sdss quasar sample , combined with other multi - wavelength datasets and additional quasar samples .",
    "this exercise updates the known ev1 correlations with improved samples and adds new quantities to the ev1 sequence . + *  as an ev1 correlator *    the strong anti - correlation between the  strength and the optical  strength in the original ev1 correlation is shown in figure  1 .",
    "the dots are individual objects , color - coded by the average strength of the [ oiii]@xmath05007  line ( i.e. , ew@xmath46}$ ] ) ; for each object , we compute an average ew@xmath46}$ ] by taking the median value of all the points within a smoothing box of @xmath47 and @xmath48 centered on that object .",
    "we plot the object only if there are more than 50 objects in the smoothing box .",
    "this is similar to measuring the average value from the composite spectrum of all the objects in that bin . this way we can better visualize the smooth trend in the average properties .",
    "given the large number of objects in each smoothing box , the statistical uncertainty in the average value is negligible , with a median error of @xmath49 dex and @xmath50 of the time below @xmath51 dex .",
    "the dominant trend in the colormap of figure  1 is the decrease of the  strength when @xmath4 increases , well known as the ev1 correlation ( 1 ) .",
    "however , there is little vertical trend in the  strength when fwhm@xmath11 changes .",
    "we have broken down the distribution in individual luminosity bins , and found similar results ; quasars with different luminosities occupy similar space in this plane , and follow the same trend with @xmath4 in terms of  strength ( although the average  strength depends on luminosity , as described below ) .    to investigate the behavior of the  line in the @xmath4-fwhm@xmath11 plane",
    ", we generate composite spectra in bins of @xmath4 and fwhm@xmath11 , and as a function of @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath4-fwhm@xmath11 bins are shown in the gray grid in figure  1 . in each bin",
    ", we divide the objects into 6 different luminosity bins , and generate the median composite spectra using the individual narrow - line - only ( i.e. , pseudo - continuum and broad h@xmath1  removed ) spectra following our spectral decomposition . in detail , we take each narrow - line - only flux density spectrum , shift it to rest - frame , rebin onto a common wavelength grid ( with a 1  dispersion ) and then convert to a luminosity density spectrum using the luminosity distance of the quasar .",
    "the composite spectrum is generated by taking the median luminosity density at each wavelength pixel for all quasars in that @xmath4-fwhm@xmath11-luminosity bin .",
    "an error spectrum is generated by dividing the 68% semi - interquantile range of the luminosity densities by the square root of the number of objects contributing to each pixel .",
    "a composite spectrum is shown only if there are more than 60 objects in the stack for that bin .",
    "typically there are more than 100 objects in each bin , and the statistical uncertainty ( i.e. , the error spectrum ) of the resulting composite spectrum is by all means negligible compared to the observed trends ( for example , median s / n@xmath52 or much higher per 1  pixel within @xmath53 of ) , and hence is suppressed in fig .  2 and extended data fig .",
    "e3 for clarity .",
    "finally we scale each line luminosity density by the median continuum luminosity @xmath21 of each @xmath4-fwhm@xmath11-luminosity bin , such that the relative flux between different composites reflects the  strength . in the last step",
    "we also corrected the average host contamination at 5100 , using the empirical relation derived using the same sdss quasar sample ( 7 ) , which only affects the lowest - luminosity bins with @xmath54 : @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",
    "figure  2 shows that  is weaker in larger @xmath4 bins but similar in different fwhm@xmath11 bins when @xmath4 is fixed , as indicated in figure  1 .",
    "in addition ,  is weaker for higher quasar luminosities , known as the  baldwin effect ( 8 - 10 ) .",
    "however , as already mentioned above , at fixed luminosity , the trend of  strength with @xmath4 still holds from the left to the right columns in figure  2 .",
    "this means that the change ( i.e. , the ev1 anti - correlation between  and  strength ) is either due to a systematic change in bh mass ( hence eddington ratio ) , or , less likely , changes in the narrow - line region properties as @xmath4 increases .",
    "another notable feature in figure  2 is that the  line profile can be decomposed into a core component , centered nearly at the systemic velocity , and a wing component , blueshifted from the systemic velocity by a few hundred @xmath57 , similar to those seen in individual objects .",
    "for the individual composite spectra shown in figure  2 , we fit the two components with double gaussians for the [ oiii]@xmath444959 , 5007  doublet and obtain the total flux , fwhm , and velocity shift of each component .",
    "we show the resulting [ oiii]@xmath05007  luminosity , normalized by @xmath21 , as a function of @xmath21 in extended data figure e1 , for both the core and the wing components . here again @xmath21 is corrected for host contamination following the above empirical recipe , and different colors show different @xmath4 bins .",
    "the measurement uncertainties of  properties are estimated using monte carlo trials of mock spectra , generated using the estimated error arrays in the coadded spectra .",
    "these measurement uncertainties are generally negligible compared to the observed trends .",
    "the weakening in the total  emission as luminosity increases is primarily due to the weakening of the core component  the wing component remains more or less constant .",
    "on the other hand , when @xmath4 increases , both  components are weakened , with the wing component again weakening at a slower pace .",
    "extended data figure  e2 shows the detailed kinematic properties of .",
    "the most significant trends are the slight correlation with luminosity of the fwhm of the core component and the velocity offset from systemic velocity of the wing component . in addition , there is a slight correlation between the velocity offset of the wing component and  strength .",
    "the qualitative and quantitative differences between the core and wing  components suggest that the two may have different origins . while the core component may be dominantly excited by photoionization , the blueshifted wing component may be more related to shocks associated with outflows ( 11 ) . as luminosity or eddington ratio increases , the underlying spectral energy distribution ( sed ) from the accreting bh changes shape ( 30,31 ) , which leads to changes in the core  strength ( see more discussions in  [ sec : main ] )",
    "of course , these are simply speculations and detailed follow - up studies are needed to test various possibilities .    a point worth noting here",
    "is that the peak of the core  component is generally consistent with the systemic velocity ( 28 ) to within @xmath58 , and is also consistent with the peak from low - ionization narrow lines such as [ oii ]  ( see extended data fig .",
    "however , a single gaussian fit to the overall  profile may yield a blueshift relative to systemic , due to the contamination from the wing component . +",
    "* other emission lines *    we find that all the high - ionization ( e.g. , with an ionization potential equal to or higher than that of , @xmath59 ev ) lines covered in the sdss spectrum have similar behaviors as  in terms of the change of line strength as @xmath4 and luminosity change . low - ionization lines ( such as , [ oii ] , [ sii ] ) , on the other hand , have similar but slightly weaker trends as @xmath4 or luminosity changes .",
    "we show in extended data figure  e3 several examples of h@xmath1 , , [ oii ]  and [ nev ] , in the same bins defined in the @xmath20fwhm@xmath11 plane . as a high - ionization line , [ nev ]  also shows a blueshifted wing component similar to .",
    "therefore , the original ev1 relation between  and optical  strengths applies to all high - ionization lines .",
    "there are two additional results from extended data figure  e3 : ( a ) the uv  strength near the  line does not correlate with the optical  strength ; ( b ) the broad  fwhm is correlated with fwhm@xmath11 , as confirmed in individual quasars ( 29 , 32 ) .",
    "we augment these optical measurements with civ  properties , using an additional sample of @xmath60 low - redshift quasars with both optical spectra covering h@xmath1  ( 24 ) and uv spectra covering civ  from various data archives of space - based satellites ( fuse , hst , iue ) .",
    "we measure the properties of civ , h@xmath1  and  in the same way as described above .",
    "extended data figure  e4 shows the distribution of this additional sample in the ev1 plane , color - coded by the civ  ew .",
    "a clear trend of decreasing civ  strength with @xmath4 is observed , similar to other high - ionization lines .",
    "this trend is real , since the typical measurement uncertainty in civ  ew is only @xmath61 ( relative ) .",
    "although we do not have enough statistics to divide this low - redshift sample by luminosity , civ  strength is well known to decrease with luminosity based on studies of high - redshift quasars , discovered as the original baldwin effect ( 10 ) .",
    "these trends also seem to correlate with the kinematic properties of civ  such as the blueshift and line asymmetry ( 2 , 33 ) . however , we note that the geometry of the civ  broad - line region ( blr ) may be different from that for the h@xmath1  blr  the main focus of this work  as inferred from the different properties of these broad lines ( 22 , 32 , 34 , 35 ) . + * mid - infrared properties *    extended data figure  e5 examines trends with optical - infrared color",
    ". we have matched our sdss quasar sample to the wise all - sky survey source catalog ( 12 ) .",
    "more than 80% of our quasars have a wise counterpart detected within 0.5  of the optical position , the typical astrometric precision for sources brighter than 16 mag in the wise @xmath62 band ( @xmath63 ) . in the following we only use the @xmath62 band , but we emphasize that similar results are found for the other wise bands at longer wavelengths as well .",
    "the top panel shows the distribution of quasars in the ev1 plane , colored - coded by the @xmath64 color , where the optical sdss @xmath65-band magnitudes have been corrected for galactic extinction . to limit the effect of band shifting due to redshift , we restrict our sample to @xmath66 . to first order",
    ", there is a trend of redder optical - wise color toward higher @xmath4 , indicating higher relative flux in the mid - infrared than in the optical when @xmath4 increases .",
    "the mid - infrared emission in wise bands mostly comes from hot dust ( here we use `` hot dust '' to refer to quasar - heated torus dust , as opposed to the hottest dust at the inner edge of the torus ) in the torus region , while the optical continuum comes from the accretion disk ( ad ) .",
    "therefore this trend suggests more efficient torus emission in high-@xmath4 objects , where the eddington ratio is higher as argued in this work .",
    "of course , the actual structure and emission of the torus may be substantially more complicated , which may explain the clumpy features in extended data fig .",
    "e5 for the optical - ir colors .",
    "our analysis is not intended to fit realistic torus models , but simply to show that , to first order , there is a clear enhancement of torus emission along the ev1 sequence .",
    "we can also study the distribution of the excess @xmath64 color , @xmath67 , the deviation from the median color at each redshift .",
    "this color excess removes the effect of band shifting with redshift and can be used to indicate the relative strength of torus to ad emission .",
    "such a colormap is shown in the right panel of extended data figure  e5 , using all sdss quasars with the relevant measurements .",
    "a similar global trend is observed along the ev1 sequence , with higher @xmath4 quasars having more torus emission relative to the disk emission .",
    "it might be tempting to connect the anti - correlation between the  strength and @xmath4 to the correlation between the torus emission and @xmath4 .",
    "if the increasing ( relative ) infrared emission along ev1 is caused by an increasing torus covering factor , the resulting solid angle of the  ionization cone will decrease along ev1 , which will lead to a decreasing  strength .",
    "however , the relative torus emission only increases by @xmath68 from @xmath69 to @xmath70 , while the average  strength decreases by at least a factor of 5 over the same @xmath4 range ( figure  1 ) .",
    "therefore , a pure geometric effect ( enhanced torus covering factor along ev1 ) can not explain the observed ev1 correlation in terms of the  strength  the change in the underlying quasar sed along ev1 is a more plausible explanation ( see  [ sec : main ] ) .    in a similar spirit to our investigations on the emission lines , we study the average optical - infrared color in bins of fwhm@xmath11 and @xmath4 , and as a function of luminosity .",
    "extended data figure  e6 shows the results , in terms of the average color excess @xmath67 in each bin .",
    "we see increased relative torus emission when @xmath4 increases , as in extended data figure  e5 . in fixed @xmath4 bins ,",
    "we see increasing relative torus emission when fwhm@xmath11 increases .",
    "this effect is subtle , only @xmath71 in the relative sense , which may explain why this was not detected in small samples with substantial object - by - object variations ( 36 ) .",
    "while alternative explanations may exist , this is consistent with the orientation scenario , wherein larger fwhms indicate more edge - on systems , where the optical luminosity is reduced by a @xmath72 factor ( where @xmath73 is the inclination angle with @xmath74 corresponding to edge - on ) , and/or suffer more from dust extinction than the infrared luminosity . to test the latter possibility",
    ", we have checked the optical @xmath75 colors in the same bins as in extended data fig .",
    "e6 , but did not find strong evidence that more edge - on systems suffer more extinction in the optical ( after accounting for the apparent reddening in the optical due to host contamination in low - luminosity bins ) .",
    "we therefore conclude , under the orientation scenario , that the geometrical reduction in the optical luminosity from an inclined ad is the main reason for the increasing relative torus emission when fwhm@xmath11 increases ( see more discussion in  [ sec : main ] ) .",
    "finally , there is a mild trend of decreasing relative torus emission when luminosity increases ( especially at the highest luminosities ) , in accord with earlier studies ( 37 ) .",
    "the finding of an ev1 sequence in terms of mid - infrared emission is new , and motivates more realistic torus models to constrain quantitatively the structure of the torus along the quasar ev1 sequence . + * x - ray properties *    finally , it is known that the soft x - ray photon index @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) increases along the ev1 sequence ( 3 , 5 ) .",
    "we matched our sdss quasars with the chandra source catalog ( csc , 38 ) and the xmm - newton serendipitous catalog ( 39 ) with a matching radius of 1  , and found @xmath78 matches .",
    "we show the distribution of these matched quasars in the ev1 plane in extended data figure  e7 , color - coded by @xmath76 , which for chandra sources were taken directly from the csc master table ( which are consistent with those measured in [ 40 ] ) and for xmm - newton sources were taken from [ 41 ] .",
    "the measurement uncertainties in @xmath76 are typically @xmath23 ( relative uncertainty ; 1@xmath35 ) for the chandra sources , and @xmath79 for the xmm sources .",
    "we find that @xmath76 increases systematically with @xmath4 , consistent with early results ( 3 , 5 ) and with the known tendency for @xmath76 to steepen with increasing eddington ratio ( 5 , 42 ) .",
    "it is known from observations of radio - loud quasars that fwhm@xmath11 can be affected by orientation ( 21 , 22 ) , such that high - inclination ( more edge - on ) systems have , on average , larger fwhm@xmath11 .",
    "the h@xmath1-emitting portion of the blr presumably has a flattened geometry aligned with the ad , whose inclination can be estimated from the radio morphology of the jet .",
    "although most ( @xmath80 ) quasars are radio - quiet , it is generally expected that orientation should play some role in determining the measured line - of - sight line widths of the general quasar population .    motivated by the lack of variation of  properties on fwhm@xmath11 at fixed @xmath4 , as well as observations of radio - loud quasars , we have suggested that most of the dispersion in fwhm@xmath11 seen at fixed @xmath4 is actually due to the orientation effect of a flattened blr geometry .",
    "we now examine this possibility in detail . + * dispersion in fwhm@xmath11 *    we show in extended data figure  e8 the dispersion of the logarithmic fwhm@xmath11 as a function of @xmath4 and in different luminosity bins . the dispersion in fwhm@xmath11",
    "is roughly @xmath81 dex at fixed @xmath4 .",
    "there is a slight trend of increasing dispersion in fwhm@xmath11 when luminosity decreases , possibly caused by the possibility that the eddington ratio distribution ( hence bh mass distribution ) at fixed luminosity is broader at faint quasar luminosities .",
    "this additional dispersion in bh mass is translated into fwhm@xmath11 , and broadens the total dispersion in fwhm@xmath11 at fixed luminosity .",
    "this additional broadening is nevertheless small , @xmath82 dex in fwhm@xmath11 comparing the distributions at the lowest and highest luminosity bins .",
    "this is in line with the idea that most of the dispersion in fwhm@xmath11 at fixed @xmath4 is due to orientation .",
    "the average fwhm@xmath11 decreases with @xmath4 , which could be due to real changes in the virial velocity of the blr gas , in which case the average fwhm@xmath11 can be used to estimate the bh mass along the @xmath4 sequence . on the other hand ,",
    "the dispersion in fwhm@xmath11 at fixed @xmath4 is due largely to an orientation effect as argued in this work , implying a flattened geometry for the blr . in the latter case , the variation in fwhm@xmath11 at fixed @xmath4",
    "does not reflect changes in the bh mass .",
    "+ * dependence on radio morphology *    as mentioned earlier , a small subset ( @xmath23 ) of quasars are radio - loud , and the radio jet morphology can be used to estimate the orientation of the ad .",
    "studies of resolved radio morphology of small ( of order @xmath83 ) samples of low - redshift radio quasars have shown an anti - correlation between the radio core dominance and fwhm@xmath11 ( 21 , 22 ) . here",
    "we perform a similar test using our sdss quasar sample .",
    "a small fraction of quasars in our sample are detected in the first radio survey ( 43 ) .",
    "for simplicity we define the first - detected quasars as the `` radio - loud '' sample and the undetected quasars as the `` radio - quiet '' sample , which is different from the traditional definition of radio - loudness . as",
    "first is a shallow radio survey , @xmath80 of the first - detected quasars satisfy the traditional definition of being radio - loud ( 7 ) .",
    "we can determine a rough radio morphology based on the number of first sources detected around the quasar ( 44 ) : for quasars that have only one first source within 30  we match them again to the first catalog with a matching radius 5  and classify the matched ones as core - dominant radio quasars .",
    "those that have multiple first source matches within 30  are classified as lobe - dominated .",
    "there are @xmath84 core - dominant and @xmath85 lobe - dominated quasars in our sample for which we also have  and h@xmath1  measurements .",
    "although this morphological classification of the radio - detected quasars is by no means perfect and introduces significant mixture of true radio morphologies between the two subsets , on average we expect the core - dominant objects are more pole - on than the lobe - dominant objects .",
    "there is no significant difference in the mean quasar luminosity between the two radio subsets .",
    "extended data figure  e9 shows the contours in the @xmath4 and fwhm@xmath11 plane for both the radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars in our sdss sample .",
    "we also show the median fwhm@xmath11 at fixed @xmath4 , for both core - dominant and lobe - dominant quasars , in this ev1 plane . at fixed @xmath4",
    ", core - dominant objects have systematically lower fwhm@xmath11 than lobe - dominant objects , consistent with the orientation hypothesis .",
    "in addition , the radio - detected population shifts to lower @xmath4 and larger fwhm@xmath11 compared with the radio - quiet population .",
    "this is a well known result ( 2 , 16 , 33 ) , consistent with the notion that radio - loud quasars preferentially reside in more massive and lower eddington ratio systems ( 16 , 45 ) . + * tests with independent bh mass estimates *    the orientation scenario posits that most of the dispersion in fwhm@xmath11 at fixed @xmath4 does not reflect the changes in the virial velocity of the blr .",
    "therefore the traditional virial bh mass estimates based on fwhm@xmath11 will lead to a fwhm - dependent bias .",
    "below we test this idea using additional quasar samples for which the bh masses can be estimated using independent methods .",
    "the first sample are the 29 local agns with reverberation mapping ( rm ) data , for which stellar velocity dispersion measurements are available ( 23 , 46 - 52 ) .",
    "we have measured the h@xmath1  and  properties using single - epoch spectra ( 24 ) for these objects , with the same fitting procedure as for the sdss quasars .",
    "we estimate the bh masses using the observed relation between stellar velocity dispersion and the bh mass for local inactive galaxies ( 25 ) . the virial coefficient , which determines the relation between fwhm@xmath11 and the underlying virial velocity , can be defined as : @xmath86 where @xmath29 is the bh mass estimated from the @xmath25 relation ( 25 ) , and @xmath14 is the blr size measured from rm for these objects ( 15 , 46 , 53 - 55 ) .",
    "we neglect the time variability between the single - epoch spectroscopy and the rm measurements of the blr size .",
    "if fwhm@xmath11 traces the virial velocity well , then at fixed bh mass there should be little trend of @xmath28 with fwhm@xmath11 .",
    "the dominant uncertainty in the estimation of @xmath28 comes from the intrinsic scatter in the @xmath25 relation ( 25 ) rather than measurement errors ( i.e. , @xmath87 dex ) .",
    "this systematic uncertainty in @xmath28 is substantial , which may be responsible for most of the vertical scatter in figure  4 , but can not drive a correlation with fwhm@xmath11 .",
    "figure  4 shows the results , where we divide the @xmath24-based bh masses into three bins . there is a clear segregation among objects with different bh masses :",
    "more massive bhs tend to have larger fwhm@xmath11 on average , indicating that fwhm@xmath11 does play some role in determining the bh mass .",
    "this statement is also supported by the fact that when fwhm@xmath11 is used in the single - epoch virial mass estimates , the correlation between these virial masses with @xmath24-based bh masses is closer to a linear relation than that without using fwhm@xmath11 ( i.e. , assuming a constant fwhm for all objects ) .",
    "however , in each mass bin , there is an apparent trend of the virial coefficient with fwhm@xmath11 , suggesting that most of the variance in fwhm@xmath11 at fixed bh mass is uncorrelated with the virial velocity ( hence the bh mass )",
    ". naturally , orientation - induced variations in fwhm@xmath11 explain the observed trend of @xmath28 with fwhm@xmath11 at given bh mass .",
    "the dispersion in fwhm@xmath11 at fixed true bh mass ( based on @xmath24 ) is about 0.2 dex , introducing a factor of @xmath88 scatter in the virial bh mass estimates based on fwhm@xmath11 ( from single - epoch spectroscopy ) at fixed true bh mass .    to improve the small - number statistics based on the rm sample",
    ", we use the stellar velocity dispersion measurements for a sample of @xmath26 low - redshift sdss agns obtained from spectral decompositions of the agn spectrum and the host spectrum ( 26 ) .",
    "these sdss agns typically have lower luminosity than our sdss quasar sample in this study , such that the host galaxy spectrum can be decomposed from the agn spectrum .",
    "we estimate the blr sizes for this sample using the observed tight @xmath89 relation based on rm ( 27 ) , and the bh masses using the same @xmath25 relation .",
    "the results are shown as colored dots in figure  4 .",
    "although there are different systematics with the two samples , it is reassuring that both produce similar trends .",
    "+ * dependence on broad line shape *    if the h@xmath1-emitting portion of the blr has a flattened , disklike geometry , as we suggest , then fwhm@xmath11 is sensitive to orientation , as it measures the core of the line profile .",
    "the blr gas motion should also include a turbulent component , whose velocity distribution is more isotropic .",
    "the second moment of the line ( i.e. , line dispersion , @xmath35 ) is more sensitive to this isotropic component than fwhm , as its measurement includes the extended wings of the line profile .",
    "therefore , the shape of the broad line as measured by the ratio fwhm/@xmath35 should be an indicator of the orientation of the disk component of the blr ( 56 , 57 ) .",
    "extended data figure  e10 shows the ev1 plane in which the objects are color - coded by fwhm@xmath90 .",
    "we measure @xmath35 of broad h@xmath1  from our multiple - gaussian model fits .",
    "this approach allows us to measure @xmath35 without the need to truncate the spectrum at some wavelength in order to avoid noisy wings .",
    "a pattern of fwhm@xmath90 is apparent , such that at fixed @xmath4 fwhm@xmath90 increases toward larger fwhm@xmath11 .",
    "this is expected in our orientation scenario : at fixed @xmath4 , fwhm@xmath11 increases when the blr disk is viewed more edge - on , but @xmath35 is less affected by orientation , leading to a larger fwhm@xmath90 ratio when the inclination increases .",
    "it is remarkable that the color transition in extended data figure  e10 is not purely vertical , but more or less parallel to the average fwhm@xmath11 at each @xmath4 .",
    "this reinforces the idea that orientation governs the distribution of fwhm@xmath11 at fixed @xmath4 , and the average fwhm@xmath11 at fixed @xmath4 corresponds to the average inclination angle of the blr disk .",
    "our investigation so far strongly supports the idea that the vertical dispersion ( in fwhm@xmath11 ) in the ev1 sequence is largely an orientation effect .",
    "a corollary is that samples divided using the fwhm - based virial bh masses will have large overlap in their true masses . on the other hand ,",
    "the optical  strength @xmath4 is most likely correlated with the eddington ratio , and hence for our main sdss sample the average bh mass should decrease from left to right in the ev1 plane .",
    "most of the quasars in our main sdss sample are too luminous to decompose the spectrum to estimate the host galaxy stellar velocity dispersion to yield a bh mass estimate independently without using fwhm@xmath11 .    to circumvent this problem , we turn to quasar clustering to infer the sample - averaged bh mass .",
    "more massive bhs are associated with more massive galaxies , which are in turn more strongly clustered ( 18 ) .",
    "this exercise has been challenging previously , because detecting a clustering difference between low - mass and high - mass quasars requires good sample statistics , and the largest quasar samples to date still do not have enough statistics to measure a potential clustering difference among different quasar subsamples using auto - correlation functions ( 58 ) .",
    "the recent large spectroscopic surveys of sdss - iii ( 59 ) provide the largest spectroscopic sample of massive galaxies ( 19 ) at @xmath91 , making it possible to cross - correlate quasars with galaxies ( 20 ) in the same redshift range for which we have the relevant quasar ev1 spectral measurements .",
    "the usage of a much larger galaxy sample to cross - correlate with the quasar sample can greatly improve quasar clustering measurements by reducing shot noise from low pair counts in quasar auto - correlation function measurements .",
    "the clustering difference we look for is subtle and requires superior measurement quality .",
    "cross - correlation boosts the signal - to - noise ratio in the clustering measurements by a factor of @xmath92 over the auto - correlation of quasars , where @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the number of galaxies and quasars in our cross - correlation samples , respectively .",
    "the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) is determined by the auto - correlation functions of both sets of tracers ; for the same galaxy sample , a stronger cross - correlation signal with a quasar subset will indicate a stronger intrinsic clustering of this quasar subset .",
    "our cross - correlation analysis represents the best measurement of quasar clustering in this redshift range , where our current sdss quasar sample lies .",
    "we follow the same approach as shen et al .  (",
    "20 ) to measure the ccf between different quasar subsets and the galaxy sample , to see if a difference can be detected .",
    "the details regarding the galaxy sample , the cross - correlation technique and error estimation can be found in that paper .",
    "here we only give a brief overview of the technical details regarding the clustering ( cross - correlation ) measurements .",
    "we select the sdss dr7 quasars ( 6 ) and the sdss - iii dr10 cmass galaxies ( 19 ) that are in the same overlapping area ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "we remove a relatively small number of quasars that were not targeted by the final quasar target selection algorithm ( 60 ) in sdss dr7 to construct a flux - limited ( @xmath96 ) quasar sample . both the cmass galaxy and the quasar samples",
    "are restricted to @xmath91 , where most of the cmass galaxies lie .",
    "most quasars in our clustering sample then have the proper spectral measurements in the h@xmath1-  region .",
    "our final clustering samples include @xmath97 galaxies and @xmath98 quasars .",
    "random catalogs were generated using the same angular geometry and redshift distributions of the cmass galaxy sample used .",
    "following the general practice of clustering measurements , we estimate the 1d and 2d redshift space correlation functions @xmath99 and @xmath100 using the davis & peebles estimator ( 61 ) : @xmath101 , where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the normalized numbers of quasar - galaxy and quasar - random pairs in each scale bin , @xmath104 is the pair separation in redshift space , and @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) is the transverse ( radial ) separation in redshift space . to reduce the effects of redshift distortions , we use the projected correlation function ( 61 ) @xmath107 in practice we integrate @xmath100 to @xmath108mpc , and this cutoff is taken into account when fitting a model correlation function to the data .    to estimate errors in the projected correlation function @xmath109 , we use jackknife resampling by dividing the clustering samples into @xmath110 spatially contiguous and roughly rectangular regions with equal area , and creating @xmath110 jackknife samples by excluding each of these regions in turn .",
    "we measure the correlation function for each of these jackknife samples , and the covariance error matrix is estimated as : @xmath111 where indices @xmath112 and @xmath113 run over all bins in the correlation function , and @xmath114 is the mean value of the statistic @xmath115 over the jackknife samples .",
    "the full covariance matrices will be used in our model fitting to the data .",
    "we consider two divisions of our main quasar sample , aiming at separating high - mass quasars from low - mass ones .",
    "the first division is based on the fwhm - based virial bh masses ( 7 , 17 ) ; we divide the quasar sample by the median virial bh mass . the second division is based on @xmath4 , whereby we divide the sample by the median @xmath4 value .",
    "we then measure the ccf between the two subsamples and the galaxy sample , and compare the measurements for both divisions . in both cases",
    "the redshift evolution of clustering is negligible given the narrow redshift range of our samples and the similar redshift distributions among different quasar subsamples .",
    "the resulting ccfs are shown in figure  3 for the two sample divisions . to compare the clustering strength among different samples , we fit simple power - law models , @xmath116 , to the ccfs .",
    "we fit to the range @xmath117 mpc and use the full covariance matrix in the @xmath118 fit ( 20 ) .",
    "we fix @xmath119 , the best - fit slope for the whole sample , and use the best - fit correlation length @xmath120 to indicate the clustering strength . for the division based on virial bh masses , we do not detect a significant difference ( @xmath22 ) in the clustering strength , with @xmath121 mpc and @xmath122 mpc for the two quasar subsamples .",
    "this is expected : as we argued before , orientation leads to a large dispersion in fwhm@xmath11 ( and hence virial bh masses ) and dilutes the intrinsic difference in bh masses between the two subsamples . on the other hand ,",
    "we detect a significant ( @xmath19 ) difference in the clustering strength when the quasar sample is divided by @xmath4 , with @xmath123 mpc and @xmath124 mpc for the two quasar subsamples .",
    "this result strengthens our earlier point that the sequence from left to right in the ev1 plane is increasing in eddington ratio , and hence on average decreasing in bh mass for our main quasar sample .",
    "this is by far the only significant detection to date of the dependence of quasar clustering on a physical property .",
    "the observed systematic trends of multi - wavelength quasar properties in the ev1 plane ( @xmath4 versus fwhm@xmath11 ) lead to a simple , coherent picture of broad - line quasars : ( a ) @xmath4 is primarily correlated with eddington ratio , although there might be a significant scatter around this correlation , such that at fixed @xmath4 there is still a dispersion of eddington ratios ; ( b ) the range of fwhm@xmath11 at fixed @xmath4 includes a substantial component due to orientation effects such that more edge - on systems have on average larger fwhm@xmath11 , indicating a flattened blr geometry , although the current analysis does not constrain the detailed structure of the postulated blr disk , such as its thickness and radial extent .    under this framework ,",
    "all observed correlations between physical properties and @xmath4 can be interpreted as due primarily to changes in the eddington ratio .",
    "these physical properties include : strength of narrow emission lines ( in particular the high - ionization lines ) , relative amount of torus emission , and x - ray spectral slope .",
    "all these properties are relevant to processes in the proximity of the accreting bh , and thus are likely tied to the accretion process itself .",
    "changes in the eddington ratio will lead to changes in the underlying sed from optical to x - rays ( 30 , 31 ) , which in turn modulates photoionization processes . in particular , this change in sed preferentially changes the relative strength between the ionizing ( euv / x - ray ) continuum and optical / uv continuum , and therefore more greatly affects high - ionization lines than low - ionization lines . the idea of sed variations has been applied to explain the baldwin effect of civ  ( 62 ) , and the same mechanism may apply to all emission lines that are powered by photoionization . in addition , there may be accompanying changes in the structure of the accretion flow and other physical processes such as accretion disk wind driving and x - ray gas shielding ( 33 , 62 , 63 ) .",
    "one possibility is that the ad thickness as well as flaring towards the bh may change with eddington ratio , which may lead to changes in the illumination configuration of the nlr .",
    "another possibility is that changes in the accretion flow modify the structure of a possible optically thick gas component in the inner ad ( 64 ) , which blocks some fraction of the emission from the inner accretion region and modifies the incident ionizing continuum as seen by the photoionized gas .",
    "this simple framework can be extended to include bh mass as a third parameter to unify both high - luminosity quasars and low - mass broad - line agns with substantially lower luminosities than the quasar sample considered here .",
    "when such low - mass systems are included in the ev1 plane ( fig .  1 ) , they will follow similar trends , with their [ oiii ] strength increased following the baldwin effect .",
    "the nature of the baldwin effect is unknown , but could be related to bh mass ( or luminosity ) that also plays a role in determining the accretion flow in addition to the eddington ratio .",
    "orientation plays an important role in broadening the distribution of fwhm@xmath11 , as expected from a flattened geometry for the blr .",
    "the dispersion in fwhm@xmath11 at fixed @xmath4 is largely dominated by the orientation effect ; it does not reflect real changes in the underlying virial velocity of the blr and therefore changes in the bh mass .",
    "although the average fwhm@xmath11 at fixed @xmath4 does correlate with the bh mass ( as confirmed by clustering analysis ) , individual fwhm@xmath11 measurements introduce substantial scatter in the virial bh mass estimates and dilute the intrinsic distinction in bh masses",
    ". the observed dependence of fwhm@xmath11 on radio morphologies , the distribution of line shape in the ev1 plane , and the relative prominence of torus emission to disk emission at fixed @xmath4 are all consistent with this orientation interpretation .",
    "the postulated blr disk should be coplanar with the ad ( or the blr itself could be an extension of the ad ) . assuming the optical luminosity @xmath21 comes from an optically - thick , geometrically - thin standard ad",
    ", the observed @xmath21 should also have an orientation bias .",
    "this is hinted by the excess optical - ir color shown in extended data fig .",
    "e6 . in our scenario , at fixed @xmath4 , the vertical bins in fig .",
    "1 represent a change in orientation of the blr disk ( and the ad ) .",
    "the change in the relative optical luminosity to ir luminosity along vertical bins is best explained by the orientation bias in optical ad luminosity ( see extended data fig .",
    "e6 ) , assuming that the ir luminosity is isotropic . denoting @xmath73 as the inclination angle between the normal of the disk and line - of - sight ( los ) , the orientation bias reduces the ad luminosity by a factor of @xmath72 from face - on . since the reduction in the relative optical - ir luminosity is roughly 20 - 30% ( @xmath16 mag ) across the vertical direction in extended data fig .",
    "e6 , this orientation bias in ad luminosity translates to @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the maximum inclination for the quasar to be a broad - line object .",
    "this @xmath126 corresponds to an average inclination angle of @xmath127 ( assuming random orientation of the disk normal to the los ) .",
    "all these are quite reasonable numbers for type 1 quasars .",
    "we also emphasize that because sdss is a shallow flux - limited survey , most of the quasars in our sample are likely seen close to face - on , and the distribution of inclination may be quantitatively different from that of other samples with heterogeneous selection . in particular , an average inclination of @xmath127 for the ad ( and by extension , the postulated blr disk ) indicates a virial coefficient of @xmath128 for the average conversion between los broad - line width ( second moment , @xmath35 ) and virial velocity @xmath129 ( i.e. , @xmath130 , neglecting turbulent broadening ) .",
    "this virial coefficient is fully consistent with the empirically derived values of @xmath131 based on the bh mass - bulge scaling relations ( 50 , 65 ) , considering the fudge factors in the average inclination angle and the unknown turbulent broadening @xmath104 ( e.g. , in practice @xmath132 , hence the actual virial coefficient @xmath133 ) .",
    "therefore , the orientation bias from a thin standard ad only introduces @xmath134 variation in @xmath21 in the vertical bins in fig .  1 ,",
    "which is consistent with no apparent trend in the [ oiii ] strength .    on the other hand , while the ad luminosity change due to orientation is small , the change in the line width will be substantial .",
    "the line width scales as @xmath135 .",
    "hence from @xmath136 to @xmath127 there is a factor of @xmath137 change ; changing from @xmath138 to nearly face - on can yield an even larger reduction factor , but at very small inclinations , the isotropic velocity component ( such as turbulence ) in the blr will start to dominate the line width .",
    "these estimates are consistent with the distribution in the 2d ev1 plane ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "although the exact values of @xmath126 and @xmath138 will be different , the approximate agreement between these simple estimates and observations is reassuring that our scenario is correct .",
    "higher - eddington ratio quasars ( with higher @xmath4 ) may drive stronger outflows in both the broad - line region and the narrow - line region .",
    "this is in line with the following observations : ( a ) the velocity offset of the wing component of  is larger in quasars with higher @xmath4 ; ( b ) the fraction of quasars with broad absorption lines , which likely arise from a disk wind ( 66 , 67 ) , seems to increase at the high-@xmath4 end of ev1 ( 4 ) , and broad absorption - line quasars usually have weak  lines ; ( c ) the enhancement of torus emission relative to ad emission at the high-@xmath4 end of ev1 may be caused by more efficient disk winds that facilitate the formation of a dusty torus ( 68 ) .",
    "in addition , we point out that fwhm@xmath139 should not be the sole criterion to define a distinct narrow - line seyfert 1 population , as done in some studies . if the narrow - line seyfert 1 phenomenon ( 69 ) is associated with one extreme end of ev1 ( 4 ) , then the classification criteria must also include strong optical  lines as well as weak  emission .",
    "finally we comment on the implication of our framework on the frequency of quasars with double - peaked broad - line profiles , dubbed `` disk emitters '' , which are characteristic of line emission from a keplerian disk ( 70 ) .",
    "the frequency of disk emitters is much higher in radio - loud quasars ( 71 ) ( @xmath140 ) than in radio - quiet quasars ( 7 , 72 ) ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "our framework suggests a flattened geometry for the blr in general , but only compact blrs will show an apparent double - peaked profile in disk models ( 70 , 73 ) , suggesting that the blr in the majority of quasars has a large extent in disk radii .",
    "radio - loud quasars are preferentially low - eddington ratio systems compared to the general quasar population ( 45 ) , and hence their blr size on average should be relatively smaller ( in units of the gravitational radius of the bh ) given the observed empirical relation between blr size and luminosity ( 27 ) .",
    "this may explain why radio - loud quasars are more often to show double - peaked broad - line profiles indicative of compact blr disks .",
