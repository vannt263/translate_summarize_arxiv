    "we started thinking seriously on how to revise the iec strategy for calculating the number of uncorrelated stirrer positions back in 2010 . in the past scientific literature , there exist other field - based strategies to measure the performance of mechanical stirrers @xcite .",
    "inherently , the structure of the field - field correlation matrix carries information about the perturbation process , e.g. , mechanical @xcite , frequency @xcite , space @xcite , time , source @xcite , or hybrid @xcite stirring .",
    "an example of multivariate correlation matrix @xcite having stirrer position pairs as elements , calculated at fixed frequency over a large chamber region , is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : rc_corr ] .",
    "the low - frequency rc behavior causes a structured off - diagonal part to appear . in the high - frequency regime , where _ spatial uncorrelation _ takes over and leads to _ stir uncorrelation _ , i.e. , uncorrelation between stir trace pairs , the rc correlation matrix assumes a purely diagonal structure .",
    "based on the concept of multi - variate correlation matrix , involving sampling through a large and dense spatial grid ( lattice ) rather than a single point measurement as suggested by the normative , we can estimate the number of uncorrelated stirrer positions more reliably .",
    "this actually allows for taking the spatial chaoticity of the rc into account along with the effect of moving the stirrer , as a whole . finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) simulations highlighted an _ overestimation _ of the traditional strategy .",
    "the multi - variate approach is believed to be more robust and reliable than the iec definition as it naturally takes into account the chaotic distribution of fields through the sampling lattice .",
    "such an approach can be employed to different physical quantity by keeping the `` thermodynamic '' equilibrium of chamber fields with respect to the ( macroscopic ) others . as an example",
    ", it is possible to calculate the number of independent lattice points , or the number of independent frequencies used in the sliding average ( electronic stirring @xcite ) w. r. t. frequency .",
    "the outcome of such an exploration is reported in @xcite . in that paper , a different approach to relate the number of independent positions to the lowest usable frequency ( luf ) has been proposed based on intra - distributions of correlation matrix elements .",
    "the emc research community actually followed this new line of enquiry along with us through the last years @xcite .",
    "the proliferation of independent stirrer positions increases linearly from the luf , and reaches a maximum after a transition region that is in the order of hundreds of mhz in an actual rc .",
    "anomalies have been discovered where this number drops down suddenly in very localized frequency narrow - bands , also belonging to the high frequency regime .",
    "this can be explained as follows : firstly the inefficiency of the irregular stirrer in breaking up cavity symmetry at _ any _ position and _ any _ frequency ; secondly the transition from a position to another ( arbitrary ) one can leave residual regular modes through the detection ( sub)volume . consequently , two expedients can be adopted to improve an rc :    * improve the mechanical stirrer geometry , also in view of its motion relatively to the baseline ( room ) cavity ; * change the baseline cavity geometry in order to create field disorder independently on stirrer geometry .",
    "the first strategy has been fulfilled through the proposal of a new stirrer geometry : the so - called `` carousel stirrer '' @xcite . in this",
    "structured , equidistant @xmath0-folded paddles are distributed through the exterior surface of a cylinder , which rotates to create cavity realizations .",
    "a scheme of the ancona small rc facility equipped with this stirrer is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : rc_geo ] .    the second strategy can be fulfilled through through geometries inspired by wave chaos , as pioneered in @xcite . in particular ,",
    "chaotic states have been observed in the high frequency limit of a 3d sinai - like .",
    "however , scars have been found at relatively high frequencies , surviving wall deformations . this field enhancement localized at unstable orbits can originate from bouncing ball @xcite as well as tangential @xcite modes .",
    "an example of bouncing ball scar in 3d cavities is reported in @xcite . to overcome this problem , in @xcite",
    "it is suggested to use multiple hemispheres and spherical caps at the center or off the center of cavity walls in order to decrease the luf of real - life reverberation chambers .",
    "this idea is pursued and refined in this study .",
    "_ in particular , we find that using an rc inspired by wave chaos geometries improves the performance , i.e. , the effectiveness , of mechanical mode - stirrers",
    ". _ figure [ fig : rc_geo ] shows a few examples of baseline geometry simulated with an in - house fdtd code in order to reduce or even cancel anomalies in the production of uncorrelated stirrer positions .",
    "therefore , we believe the joint use of wall deformations and mechanical stirrers to be a good solution . figure [ fig : nind_sph ] shows the comparison between rc equipped with a `` carousel '' stirrer with and without deformations .",
    "it is worth noticing that , being cylindrical , the `` carousel '' geometry creates a ( discrete , irregular ) sinai - like smooth surface enhancing wave chaotic regime .",
    "this is confirmed by fdtd full - wave simulations of the rc .",
    "the resulting field distribution is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : field_2d ] for a 2d plane of the 3d rc , which is clearly specked as for chaotic states .    besides reducing anomalies",
    ", there are other interesting consequences .",
    "interestingly , we notice the presence of much more ergodic modes at low frequencies as a consequence of the chaotic dynamics created by spherical surfaces .",
    "wave chaos implies high sensitivity to the cavity boundaries .",
    "we expect that the number of independent positions of the stirrer might change for different boundary geometries , i.e. , either the polygonal geometry proposed originally or the wave - chaos inspired geometry proposed recently should behave differently .",
    "further work is in progress to visualize fields at those anomalous frequencies , where we expect to find scars and regular tangential modes that localize energy in spatial region not affected by the presence of a stirrer .",
