    "systems of entangled qubits are central to most protocols for transmitting and processing quantum information , such as the quantum key distribution @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum secure direct communication @xcite , quantum dense coding @xcite , and quantum state sharing@xcite .",
    "all the applications require the entangled qubit systems to setup the quantum channel . in the applications , photons are the best long - range carriers of quantum information , for photons have long decoherence time , and are relatively easy to manipulate . among various entanglement forms ,",
    "the single - photon entanglement with the form of @xmath0 is the simplest one .",
    "the single - photon entanglement describes a superposition state , in which the single photon is in two different locations a and b. the single - photon entanglement has wide applications in the qip tasks .",
    "for example , the well known duan - lukin - cirac - zoller ( dlcz ) repeater protocol @xcite requires the quantum state with the form of @xmath1 , where the @xmath2 and @xmath3 represent the excited state and the ground state of the atomic ensembles , respectively . in 2005 , chou _",

    "proposed an interesting protocol for constructing an interferometric telescope based on the single - photon entanglement@xcite . with the help of the single - photon entanglement ,",
    "the protocol has the potential to eliminate the baseline length limit , and realize the interferometers with arbitrarily long baselines in principle .",
    "unfortunately , in the practical applications , the environmental noise can make the photonic quantum system decoherence , which may cause the maximally entangled single - photon entangled state degrade to a mixed state or a pure less - entangled state .",
    "such less - entangled state may decrease after the entanglement swapping and can not ultimately set up the high quality quantum entanglement channel @xcite .",
    "therefore , in practical applications , we need to recover the mixed state or the pure less - entangled state into the maximally entangled state .",
    "the pure less - entangled state , which will be detailed here , can be recovered into the maximally entangled state by the method of entanglement concentration @xcite . in 1996 , bennett _ et al .",

    "round , they require two pairs of less - entangled states to complete the task . recently , zhou and sheng proposed a simplified ecp for spe .",
    "only one pair of less - entangled state and local single photons were required @xcite .    up to now , though several ecps for spe were discussed .",
    "they do not consider the exact information encoded in the single photon , which will limit its practical application .",
    "moreover , existing ecps for spe are not suitable for the case that the less - entangled spe contains the unknown polarized information in the single photon . because existed ecps all depend on the hong - ou - mandel interference , which requires the two photons are identical .",
