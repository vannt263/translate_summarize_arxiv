    "the fascinating property of the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) that initially attracted such great attention to the phenomenon is the precise quantization of the hall conductivity @xmath2 at certain values of the magnetic field .",
    "most theoretical research has focused on the properties of the electron system inside these quantized plateaus in @xmath2 .",
    "the plateaus have been associated with the incompressibility of the 2d electron gas , arising either from landau quantization , at integer filling factors , or from electron - electron interactions , at fractional filling factors .",
    "the transition regions , where @xmath2 crosses over between quantized values and the longitudinal conductivity @xmath5 experiences maxima , have received less attention .",
    "the main factor which inhibits progress in this direction is the lack of reproducible experimental results on the inter - plateau regions , despite the impressive stock of data on the qhe which has been accumulated over the last decade .",
    "in addition to the fact that the general behavior of the qhe depends on the electron density , temperature and disorder , samples cut from the same substrate and measured at the same temperature often reveal different dependences @xmath6 and @xmath7 . this annoying data dispersion is particularly apparent at low temperatures.@xcite certain success in obtaining reproducible data has been achieved only for the critical behavior of the width of inter - plateau regions at low temperatures.@xcite however , as far as the heights or shapes of the peaks in @xmath5 are concerned , the general impression is that too many factors are involved to allow any systematic conclusions .",
    "on the other hand , there do exist a number of theoretical works which argue that certain universal behavior of the conductivity tensor must exist at low temperatures in the regions between well - pronounced pairs of plateaus ( critical regime ) .",
    "kucera and streda@xcite considered semi - classical single - electron transport in a partially filled landau level for a simple model of a periodic long - range potential .",
    "they found that the maximum value of @xmath5 reached at half - integer filling factors does not depend on either the magnitude of the potential or the landau level number @xmath8 and is equal to @xmath9 .",
    "this result was later mapped onto the fractional regime by using two related approximations of the correlated electron state : the dirty boson@xcite and the composite fermion approach.@xcite a different sort of argument for both integer and fractional regime was presented in refs .   and .",
    "based on the rather general assumption that , at low temperatures , the electron system in a critical transition region can be represented by a random mixture of two quantum liquids with different quantized local hall conductivities @xmath10 and @xmath11 , it was shown that @xmath5 and @xmath2 are connected by a universal relation .",
    "the peak height @xmath0 was found to be equal to one half of the difference between the hall conductivities of the adjacent plateaus @xmath12 .",
    "for the integer peaks , this result yields the value @xmath9 obtained in ref .. for the fractional regime , it matches the results of refs .   and , after the latter are somewhat corrected to allow for the fact that the maxima of @xmath7 of the integer peaks do not map exactly onto the maxima of @xmath7 for the principal series.@xcite we can also refer the reader to quantum monte - carlo studies in ref . where the same value , @xmath13 , for the integer peaks was obtained in a simulation of single - electron scattering off short - range impurities .",
    "thus , while different theoretical models agree on an expected universality of the conductivity peak heights and even on their values , experiment offers no evidence to support this prediction .",
    "to make the situation even more confusing , a puzzling feature was observed in a number of experiments performed at very low temperatures ( 15 - 40 mk ) : the relative heights of most of the conductivity peaks obtained in the fractional regime were , indeed , found to scale approximately as @xmath14 , but with an absolute factor which differed from @xmath15 and , moreover , varied from sample to sample.@xcite such a `` universality within one sample '' , while there is none between different samples , is hard to understand .",
    "this feature was especially well seen in recent experiments performed in the corbino geometry@xcite where scaling of the peak heights was observed simultaneously for the fractional and integer regimes , i.e. , in quite different ranges of magnetic field . as a function of temperature , the height of each peak was found to pass through a maximum value .",
    "these maximum values differed for different peaks , being scattered below , though not very far from , the universal values predicted by theory",
    ". on the low temperature side of these maxima , therefore , with decreasing temperature the peak heights fell further below the universal values , as has also been earlier observed in low - mobility samples.@xcite at the lowest temperatures ( 14 mk ) , however , different peaks in a given sample converged to the corresponding theoretical values multiplied by the same sample - dependent factor .    in this work , we suggest an explanation of the phenomenon of the `` non - universal '' scaling of the peak heights .",
    "our explanation assumes that in the interior of the sample there exist random inhomogeneities of the electron density with a very large correlation length .",
    "while the origin of these inhomogeneities is unclear , we note that the existence of such fluctuations was also a necessary assumption in recent work@xcite which proposed an explanation for another experimental puzzle  the resistivity law , which is observed in some samples at higher temperatures .",
    "we can only speculate as to whether such fluctuations might result from imperfections in the doping process or from incomplete equilibration of the electron density on sample cool - down , or from both .",
    "the fact that the experimental traces in the inter - plateau regions often change after the sample is reheated and cooled down again , indicates that that the latter mechanism may be important . by whatever means",
    "they might arise , we argue that even small fluctuations of the electron density become crucial at low enough temperatures , where the dependence of the conductivity tensor on the local value of the filling factor is almost singular . in particular , we show that , due to the finite size of the sample , the sample edge gives rise to a positive contribution to the corbino resistance which is proportional to @xmath16 .",
    "this contribution increases with decreasing temperature due to the growing correlation radius of the random clusters which are responsible for the current transfer . at sufficiently low temperatures ,",
    "when the correlation radius exceeds the sample size , the edge contribution dominates the sample conductance .",
    "the heights of the observed peaks in @xmath5 in a given sample are found to freeze at values which differ from the corresponding `` universal '' values in an infinite sample by a random geometric factor which is the same for all peaks .    by making use of a current - voltage duality that exists in two - dimensional conductivity problems ,",
    "we show how our results may also be applied to the hall bar geometry .",
    "we find that macroscopic inhomogeneities have the same effect on the measured peaks in @xmath17 in this geometry as on the peaks in @xmath5 for the corbino disc .",
    "this is in agreement with the fact that sample - dependent scaling of the peak heights has been observed in both geometries@xcite .    it has previously been realized that density inhomogeneities may distort conductivity measurements in the hall bar geometry . in particular , for certain gated or mesa - etched systems , the boundary to a vacuum",
    "is believed to involve a rather gradual decrease in electron density .",
    "this creates a strip along the edge with a quantized hall conductivity and very low scattering , while the bulk of sample can be in a transition region with noticeable dissipation .",
    "such a strip can trap a significant portion of the current , making the current distribution in the sample inhomogeneous and affecting the measured resistance @xmath3 . in the language of the edge - transport theory , this can be re - formulated as poor equilibration between the edge states and the bulk .",
    "while this model has been successful in accounting for certain non - local resistance measurements , the presence of a smooth edge can not explain the observed non - universal scaling of the conductivity peak heights .",
    "therefore , since the random bulk inhomogeneities are crucial for this scaling , and since the effects of a smooth edge have been discussed before,@xcite in this work we will focus only on the consequences of macroscopic bulk inhomogeneities .",
    "the results we present for the hall bar therefore apply to samples with sharp edges ( i.e. , with the edge width less than magnetic length ) . for certain samples ,",
    "some combination of the two models may be appropriate .",
    "as well as giving rise to `` non - universal scaling '' of the peak heights at the lowest temperatures , we show that macroscopic inhomogeneities in the bulk also lead to an enhancement of the non - local resistance .",
    "in fact , by developing a general `` boundary - strip '' approach which describes finite - size effects in a macroscopically inhomogeneous sample , we show that , for a sample with a sharp edge , both of these effects are directly related . using this relation ,",
    "we propose an experimental method by which the edge contribution in the observed resistivity may be separated from the bulk contribution , at least over the range of temperature for which the edge contribution is not too big ( at intermediate @xmath18 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss the role of macroscopic inhomogeneities in the transport properties of an infinite qhe system in different regimes of temperature .",
    "finite - size effects on the low - temperature two - terminal resistance of an inhomogeneous corbino disc are considered in sec .",
    "iii and in the _",
    "appendix_. the boundary impedance matrix formalism , which provides a description of small edge contributions to the measured resistances in any sample geometry ( corbino disc , hall bar etc . ) , is developed in sec .",
    "the explicit form of the impedance matrix is evaluated for a macroscopically inhomogeneous sample with a sharp edge .",
    "the enhanced `` non - local '' resistance arising from the macroscopic inhomogeneities is studied in sec .",
    "v , where it is also shown that this is directly related to the edge corrections in the measured `` local '' and hall resistances .",
    "vi concludes the paper .",
    "we consider an infinite sample in the presence of macroscopic inhomogeneities of the electron density .",
    "the local value of the filling factor can be written as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the average filling factor , and @xmath21 is a small fluctuating component with a magnitude @xmath22 .",
    "we assume that some impurity scattering occurs on scales much smaller than @xmath23 , such that the local conductivity tensor exhibits the quantum hall effect .",
    "specifically , we will assume that at a critical value @xmath24 , the hall conductivity undergoes a sharp crossover between two quantized values , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "here @xmath27 and @xmath28 are a pair of adjacent values of @xmath29 at which the electron system is incompressible , @xmath30 .",
    "the diagonal conductivity @xmath31 has a sharp peak in the crossover region , being very small everywhere else .",
    "the width of the crossover region @xmath32 vanishes as @xmath33 .",
    "we can consider this picture as simply following from numerous experimental data on the low - temperature quantum hall effect in large samples .",
    "the critical behaviour of the conductivity tensor has been much studied .",
    "the width of the crossover region vanishes as @xmath33 according to @xmath34 with an exponent @xmath35 which has been argued to take the universal value @xmath36.@xcite in the zero temperature limit , the maximum value of the dissipative conductivity is thought to approach @xmath9 in the spin - split integer quantum hall effect,@xcite and @xmath37 for the fractional regime.@xcite as explained in the introduction , this prediction was deduced from the hypothesis that the correlated electron state in the vicinity of a qhe transition represents a random mixture of two incompressible liquids with localized quasiparticles on top .",
    "the correlation radius @xmath38 of this two - phase system was assumed to be larger than the magnetic length @xmath39 . to avoid confusion ,",
    "we emphasize that the correlation radius of the macroscopic density fluctuations @xmath23 that we consider in the present work is assumed to be much larger than @xmath38 which is thus considered as a microscopic length .",
    "the `` local '' conductivity tensor @xmath40 introduced above is defined at scales larger than @xmath38 ( and , if effects of quantum interference are important , larger than the phase - breaking length ) but smaller than @xmath23 . for our purposes ,",
    "the peak value of the local dissipative conductivity will not be important ; we shall only assume that it is either of the order of or less than the difference in the quantized values of the hall conductivity , @xmath41 .",
    "we believe that this assumption agrees with existing data on the quantum hall effect in a strong magnetic field .",
    "let the magnetic field be tuned so that the average filling factor @xmath20 is close to @xmath24 .",
    "at sufficiently low temperatures , the crossover width @xmath32 becomes much less than the fluctuation magnitude @xmath42 which is small but temperature independent .",
    "hence , as temperature goes down , the conductivity distribution becomes strongly inhomogeneous . in most of the sample , as illustrated in fig .",
    "1(a , b ) , the hall conductivity @xmath2 is quantized at either @xmath11 or @xmath10 , and the diagonal conductivity @xmath5 is very small .",
    "only a narrow intermediate region within the interval @xmath43 , has a noticeable @xmath5 ( this region is indicated by the grey color in fig .",
    "as long as @xmath20 stays within this interval , the `` grey '' region forms an infinite percolation cluster .",
    "the latter consists of strips of a small width @xmath44 which join near saddle points ( critical vertices ) .",
    "the characteristic size of a cluster cell , i.e. , the distance between two vertices follows from classical percolation theory@xcite @xmath45 we note that the true geometry of the percolating cluster includes also loops and by - passes on links between vertices not shown in fig .",
    "1(c ) .    the evaluation of the effective conductivity tensor @xmath46 requires an understanding of how the current density is distributed in such an inhomogeneous system .",
    "the current distribution is known to be quite different in the two limiting cases which are reached as the relative values of the dimensionless parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 are varied .",
    "when @xmath49 is very small ( how small will be determined below ) , the continuity conditions force the current to flow almost exactly along lines of constant @xmath2.@xcite for an infinite random system , this means that the current is concentrated near the percolation threshold of the function @xmath50 , within a sparse percolation network inside the grey area shown in fig .",
    "the characteristic parameters of this new network  the width @xmath51 and the length @xmath52 of an elementary link of the cluster ",
    "are determined by the value of @xmath5 at the percolation level in @xmath29 .",
    "they can be estimated from the self - consistent condition that the current is able to cross the lines of constant @xmath2 in order to pass from one critical saddle point of the network to the next one , which has a slightly different value of @xmath2.@xcite we give here the final expressions for both parameters    @xmath53    the net diagonal conductivity of the system @xmath54 is determined by the geometry of an elementary link , as given by @xmath55 which yields , for the maximum value of @xmath5    @xmath56    note that the effective conductivity decreases with increasing temperature , more or less as @xmath57 , unless the temperature dependence @xmath1 is very sharp .",
    "the net hall conductivity @xmath58 does not depend on the geometry of the network and simply coincides , apart from small corrections , with the percolation threshold value @xmath59 .",
    "hence , @xmath58 crosses over from @xmath11 and @xmath10 within the same interval of @xmath60 as does the local hall conductivity , @xmath61 .",
    "this picture is correct provided @xmath5 is sufficiently small and the grey regions are not too narrow , such that the current can stay within these regions , @xmath62 .",
    "the last condition can be written as @xmath63 , with @xmath64 given by the equation @xmath65 the regime exists only if @xmath5 is much less than @xmath41 at temperatures at which the system can already be considered to be macroscopically homogeneous , @xmath66 .",
    "as the temperature is reduced below @xmath64 , the current spills out into the quantum hall regions . in the limit @xmath67 , which will be mostly considered in the rest of the paper , the currents flow predominately in the quantized hall regions .",
    "the details of the grey areas become unimportant ( except near the saddle points ) , and they may be replaced by sharp boundaries .",
    "this represents a particular example from a class of `` black - and - white '' systems which was studied in refs .. due to the continuity conditions and the absence of scattering in the bulk , the currents in the `` black '' and `` white '' phases can not cross the phase boundary .",
    "instead , the currents have to focus at vertices to pass between the two corners of the same color .",
    "the net conductivity tensor depends on the ratio of the average currents flowing in the two phases which is controlled by @xmath60 . at @xmath68 ,",
    "all saddle points have values of @xmath2 close to @xmath11 which ensures good percolation in the `` black '' color , so that white current is relatively small and @xmath69 . at @xmath70 ,",
    "we get good percolation in `` white '' , and @xmath71 . a crossover takes place within the interval @xmath32 when both currents are comparable . since the local diagonal conductivity is small in both quantized regions , the net conductivity @xmath54 is also small when either of these phases percolates freely , and experiences maximum in the crossover region . in the limit of zero dissipation in each of the quantized hall regions , the dependence of @xmath72 of the isotropic two - phase system",
    "is known to be a universal function  a semicircle@xcite    @xmath73    in particular ,",
    "the maximum value of the average conductivity is    @xmath74    independent of the details of the `` grey '' areas .    to conclude",
    ", the long - range inhomogeneities in the infinite sample do not essentially alter the conductivity peak width .",
    "they cause the peak height in @xmath54 to saturate at low temperatures at the universal value ( [ universal ] ) . if the microscopic conductivity tensor components @xmath75 , as argued in refs . , also satisfy the `` semicircle '' relation ( [ semic ] ) , then the presence of the macroscopic inhomogeneities has no effect in the low - temperature limit . in a finite sample ,",
    "however , as we now proceed to show , @xmath54 at @xmath76 deviates drastically from the universal value due to the inhomogeneities .",
    "to study finite - size effects , we have to resort to a realistic experimental set - up which means that we have to specify the geometry of the sample and the attachment of the contacts .",
    "experiments are performed on the hall bar , in the van der pauw method , and on the corbino disk",
    ". our initial choice will be the corbino disc on which recent experiments in ref .",
    "have been performed . in sec .",
    "iii , we show how to transfer our results to the hall bar using the current - voltage duality .",
    "we will not discuss the van der pauw geometry explicitly in this work .",
    "a corbino disc cut from an inhomogeneous sample is shown schematically in fig .",
    "the two - terminal resistance between the metal probes attached at the inner and outer circular edges is measured .",
    "we consider an ideal contact without any tunnel barriers or dielectric layers between metal and sample , the metal boundary having a constant potential .",
    "we assume , first , that the correlation radius of the `` grey '' cluster @xmath77 is much less than all sample dimensions , @xmath78 and @xmath79 . in the limit @xmath80 ,",
    "the sample can be considered to be homogeneous with the conductivity tensor @xmath81 . the two - terminal resistance is then given by    @xmath82    where @xmath83 is the geometric aspect ratio , which for @xmath84 is close to @xmath85 . a finite value of @xmath86 , as we now demonstrate , leads to an increase in the two - terminal resistance above this value ( [ r0 ] ) due to an effective contact contribution .",
    "the simplest way to estimate this correction is by monitoring the joule heat dissipated in the sample . at low temperatures , @xmath87 , as already discussed , the currents flow in the ( black or white ) quantized hall regions .",
    "since scattering in the bulk is negligible , the currents can not cross the phase boundaries and , in order to pass through the sample , must focus at vertices formed by adjacent corners of different phases .",
    "all the energy dissipation in the system occurs in `` hot spots '' at the vertices .",
    "the vertices are of two kinds : 4-vertices in the sample interior , formed by alternating `` black '' and `` white '' corners , and 3-vertices at the boundary , `` black - white - metal '' . the above resistance ( [ r0 ] ) corresponds to dissipation at internal vertices , as given by    @xmath88    since the metal contact boundary is at a constant potential , the current lines have to focus at 3-vertices in order to enter the ( e.g. , inner ) contact .",
    "this causes additional dissipation at the edge given by @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the current passing to the metal at the 3-vertex @xmath91 , and @xmath92 is the effective resistance of the vertex .",
    "it turns out that focusing of the current lines occurs only at those of the 3-vertices at which the hall conductivity @xmath2 increases from @xmath11 to @xmath10 to the right when looking into the sample from the metal ( we call these `` active '' vertices ) . for the remaining half of the vertices , @xmath93 . as shown in the _ appendix",
    "_ , the resistance of an active 3-vertex is always given by @xmath94 independent of the microscopic details of the vertex core .",
    "in particular , the result remains valid if the phase boundary branches when approaching the metal forming a fork - like structure , as illustrated in fig .",
    "2(b ) in magnified view . branching , though not shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) , does occur in a random percolation cluster on scales smaller than @xmath77 .",
    "only the fork vertices with white as the rightmost color are active .    for a uniform pattern of white / black regions , the current entering the contact will be shared approximately equally between the @xmath95 vertices at the edge so that    @xmath96    the total two - terminal resistance @xmath97 can be found from the total joule heat , @xmath98 using eqs .",
    "( [ r0])-([qedg ] ) , we find    @xmath99    the second term in this expression is , of course , an estimate . in the next section , we re - derive eq .",
    "( [ rtot ] ) rigorously for a simple model of a periodic chessboard two - phase distribution with @xmath77 replaced by the square size .",
    "thus , at the maximum of @xmath100 , the relative correction to the peak resistance arising from the edges is of the order of @xmath86 .",
    "( we assumed here that @xmath101 is not much less than @xmath102 , and used the fact that , at the lowest temperatures , @xmath103 ) .",
    "the experimentally measured value of the diagonal conductivity @xmath104 defined by @xcite @xmath105 is now lower than the `` bulk '' conductivity @xmath54 by the same relative amount .",
    "this negative correction increases as temperature is lowered , since @xmath77 becomes larger [ eq .",
    "( [ xit ] ) ] .",
    "we believe that the decrease in @xmath104 that we predict from these considerations provides a possible explanation for the observations of rokhinson _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "note that the correction to @xmath104 may be different for different conductivity peaks since the width @xmath32 and , hence , the correlation length @xmath77 , may vary from peak to peak .",
    "this accounts for the dispersion of traces @xmath1 observed for different peaks in the integer regime , see data for two samples by rokhinson _",
    "et al._@xcite which we reproduced here in fig .",
    "3 . at the lowest temperatures , however ,",
    "as one can see from the figure , all the traces converge and tend to collapse onto one curve .",
    "the corresponding low - temperature value can be written as @xmath106 , where the coefficient @xmath107 is almost the same for different peaks , but is sample - dependent@xcite ( compare figs .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) ) .",
    "as found in the quoted work , the well - pronounced peaks in the fractional regime have the height @xmath108 , with approximately the same @xmath107 as do the peaks obtained on the same sample in the integer regime .",
    "this agrees with earlier data on the fractional quantum hall effect mostly obtained in the hall bar geometry@xcite which show that , at the lowest temperatures , most of the peak heights are proportional to the difference in adjacent plateaus in @xmath2 , with a prefactor that fluctuates from sample to sample .",
    "to understand the origin of the curious `` universality within one sample '' let us consider the lowest temperatures .",
    "since the characteristic correlation radius @xmath77 grows as the temperature is reduced , it will eventually become of the same order as the distance between the contacts @xmath109 at some temperature @xmath110 . at this point , the edge contribution to the resistance in eq .",
    "( [ rtot ] ) is as large as the bulk contribution .",
    "when temperature is decreased further , @xmath111 , a strong inequality @xmath112 is met for any peak , so that no critical 4-vertices ( shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) for higher temperatures ) fall within the sample .",
    "the current is transported directly from contact to contact by one or more pairs of `` white '' and `` black '' clusters connecting the contacts .",
    "`` black '' and `` white '' clusters of the size @xmath109 can exist simultaneously while @xmath60 is in the interval @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is determined from the equation    @xmath115    outside of this interval , percolation between contacts can exist only in one phase , either in the `` white '' or in the `` black '' .",
    "the resistance in this case is equal to that of a homogeneous corbino sample with no scattering inside , that is , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 .",
    "hence , @xmath114 in eq .",
    "( [ width ] ) represents the observed peak width .",
    "notice that @xmath114 does not depend on temperature and is much larger than the value for the infinite sample @xmath32 . since no 4-vertices are now found in the sample , the finite value of @xmath32 is no longer relevant .",
    "all temperature dependence has now disappeared from the problem and all the peaks @xmath118 must become identical .",
    "we suggest that this explains why the experimental traces @xmath119 in integer regime converge at low temperatures@xcite .",
    "recall that it was the differing values of @xmath32 that caused the contact contributions to the total resistance to vary for different peaks at @xmath120 .",
    "this saturation of the peak width which we predict at low temperatures is similar to the well - known saturation effect which is expected to occur in small samples when the coherence length @xmath121 becomes comparable to the sample size.@xcite the observable difference between the two mechanisms is in the size dependence , @xmath122 : we predict the classical index @xmath123 instead of the @xmath36 which is thought to be appropriate for the quantum problem.@xcite    we now discuss the height and possible shape of the peak . as we shall show below , in the zero - temperature limit , the two - terminal conductance @xmath124 can take only quantized values    @xmath125    where @xmath126 is an integer ( including zero ) which depends on the specific realization of the disorder .",
    "as the average filling fraction is varied , the value of the integer @xmath126 may change , and the peak in @xmath127 can display an unusual step - like dependence on filling fraction , as illustrated schematically in fig . 4c and 4d . although the shape of these peaks ( number and position of the steps ) depends on the specific realization of disorder ,",
    "this shape is the same , with the peak height expressed in units of @xmath41 , for all peaks in a given sample .",
    "let us fix the average filling factor @xmath60 somewhere within the peak width @xmath114 , e.g. , at the point @xmath128 .",
    "we have to distinguish two major cases depending on the random configuration of a sample .",
    "either both `` black '' and `` white '' percolate in the radial direction , or both `` black '' and `` white '' percolate in the azimuthal direction , as illustrated in fig .",
    "4(a ) and 4(b ) .",
    "together with the case in which only one phase percolates in both directions , which we determined above as being outside of the peak width , this exhausts all topological possibilities . in the case of azimuthal percolation ,",
    "4(b ) , the current can barely pass between contacts since it is not allowed to cross the phase boundary .",
    "hence , peaks are missing , @xmath116 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath129 is as small as the average of @xmath5 in the quantized regions , and therefore rapidly vanishes as @xmath33 .",
    "such behavior is observed in experiment@xcite , but it is usually attributed to a `` bad sample '' or `` bad contacts '' and , consequently , does not reach publication . in some sense , it is correct to say this in our model as well ; however , both `` bad '' and `` good '' samples belong to the same statistical ensemble with a quite small amplitude of inhomogeneities . in the case shown in fig .",
    "4(a ) , when the contacts are connected by one `` black '' and by one `` white '' region the resistance is finite and equal to the doubled resistance of the 3-vertex @xmath130 , see eq .",
    "( [ r3 ] ) for the 3-vertex resistance .",
    "we can easily obtain the shape of the peak in @xmath104 for the configuration in fig .",
    "let @xmath27 and @xmath28 be the filling factors at the two saddle points which control the current transfer , @xmath131 .",
    "when @xmath60 is shifted down and crosses the level of the lower saddle - point @xmath27 , the corresponding `` black '' bridge becomes `` white '' , and percolation in `` black '' quits , so that the resistance @xmath97 becomes infinite .",
    "this transition occurs abruptly in @xmath60 ( more precisely , within a small interval @xmath132 ) .",
    "similarly , for @xmath133 the `` white '' region percolates , and the system is on a quantized hall plateau corresponding to @xmath28 .",
    "the resulting `` peak '' in @xmath104 represents a box of a width @xmath134 , fig .",
    "the latter is of the order of @xmath114 and fluctuates from sample to sample by 100% .",
    "there may , of course , be more than one pair of `` black '' and `` white '' regions connecting the contacts ( and , hence , more saddle points which switch ) .",
    "since all of the 3-vertices at the same edge are connected in parallel , the inverse resistance is given by eq .",
    "( [ quant ] ) , where @xmath126 is the number of pairs of connecting regions . in the degenerate case shown in fig .",

    "thus the total conductance of the sample is an integer multiple of @xmath41 .",
    "the number of `` quanta '' @xmath126 depends on the value of @xmath60 . a typical shape of the peak for @xmath136 is shown in fig .",
    "each step in @xmath104 results from the switch of some saddle - point from a `` black '' to a `` white '' bridge .",
    "note that the resistance ( [ quant ] ) does not demonstrate regular scaling with the aspect ratio of the sample since @xmath126 is just a random integer varying from sample to sample .",

    "our prediction of the _ longitudinal _ resistance quantization allows a comparison of our theory with the experiments of ref .. although neither of the two samples shown in fig .",
    "3 reveals the saturation of the peak heights which we expect to occur at low enough temperature , still , we can see that the heights of all peaks become close to each other at the lowest temperature studied , @xmath143 .",

    "3 , for both samples we obtain @xmath145 within an accuracy of 10% ( we averaged @xmath146 over 5 values for different peaks in sample b ) .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath147 in eq .",
    "( [ quant ] ) which is consistent with our prediction .",
    "thus , at least for these data , the `` fluctuation '' of @xmath104 between samples is simply correlated with the different aspect ratios , @xmath83 , which were used to calculate @xmath148 .",
    "so far , we have considered the simplest geometry of the corbino disc .",
    "although this method can directly produce the value of @xmath5 for a homogeneous system , it also has some obvious disadvantages .",
    "firstly , it does not allow one to measure the hall conductivity .",
    "secondly , it leaves no hope of separating @xmath104 into the contributions arising from the bulk and those arising from the edge .",
    "both disadvantages stem from the fact that only one independent experimental parameter ( the two - terminal resistance ) is obtained in this method . to permit a larger number of independent measurements one must consider another geometry , such as the hall bar . as we will show in this section , macroscopic inhomogeneities in a finite - sized hall bar lead to a similar decrease of the observed peak heights in @xmath149 as for the observed peak heights of @xmath104 in the corbino disc geometry . in sec .",
    "v , we will suggest a method by which this edge effect may be compensated in the hall bar geometry , at least , over the temperature range for which this contribution is small . at the lowest temperatures , @xmath111 , as clearly follows from analysis in sec .",
    "iii , all information on the bulk properties is lost beyond recovery .    for the remainder of this paper",
    "we will therefore focus on the regime of small edge corrections . in this limit ,",
    "it is possible to develop a theory in which the edge effects can be accounted for by a `` boundary strip '' . within this formalism , the corbino disc and hall bar",
    "are thought of as homogeneous samples with an infinitesimally thin layer attached at their boundaries to account for the edge - effects .",
    "this `` boundary strip '' is characterized by an impedance matrix which linearly relates the currents in the strip to the potential gradients at the boundary .",
    "effectively the presence of this strip changes the boundary conditions on the sample .",
    "such an approach is valid provided ( i ) the region along the edge responsible for the edge effects is narrow and ( ii ) the edges are homogeneous along their length .",
    "the first condition is necessary since otherwise one has to take into account , in addition to the gradients , second and higher derivatives of the electric potential to describe the boundary impedance .    in physical devices",
    ", there are two main types of edge effects that are important for transport .",
    "firstly , the finite - size effects due to the macroscopic inhomogeneities of the interior of the sample , as discussed above .",
    "this type of inhomogeneity , if present , is equally important for the hall bar and the corbino disc .",
    "secondly , smooth - edge effects caused by a gradual change in the electron density when approaching the sample edge .",
    "one should expect the latter effect to be much stronger in the hall bar geometry in which electron density at the edge is zero . in principle , the boundary strip formalism is rather general and can be used to account for both types of inhomogeneities . for the macroscopic inhomogeneities , both of the conditions outlined in the previous paragraph are satisfied if the correlation radius @xmath77 is much less then the sample width and , in the hall bar , the distance between the voltage probes .",
    "both conditions would also be satisfied for a hall bar with a smooth edge if the voltage probes were small enough as not to affect the edge properties .",
    "in real devices , however , the probes are macroscopically large and interrupt the edge strip . within the model of non - local resistance proposed by mceuen _",
    "et al . _ , based on the edge - state formalism , the contacts have a strong effect on the current distribution , since they force equilibration between different edge channels.@xcite such a model is a clear example of a case in which the edge is not homogeneous along its length , and for which the boundary strip formalism does not apply",
    ". we will therefore focus only on cases for which the edge of the hall bar represents a sharp cut in the inhomogeneous sample , i.e. the characteristic width of the edge region is less than the magnetic length .",
    "the boundary properties are then independent of whether the edge is to vacuum ( hall bar ) or to metal ( corbino disc ) .",
    "below we will show how the conductance properties of such an edge can be related to the parameters of the two - phase model .",
    "first , we will derive the properties of the boundary strip for a periodic array of the two regions , and then we will discuss how these are modified for a random distribution .    as we have seen in sec .",
    "iii , the corners formed at each edge by alternating phases create an effective strip with properties distinct from that of the interior of the sample . while discussing the corbino disc , the boundary strip has been characterized by a single parameter , the contact resistance .",
    "this is defined as the ratio of the voltage drop across the strip @xmath150 to the current @xmath151 crossing the strip , under the condition that the electric field component along the edge @xmath152 is zero . in general , quite different boundary conditions may be applied .",
    "for instance , in the standard hall bar measurement , @xmath153 we need to develop a quantitative description for the boundary strip which does not depend on specific boundary conditions and which therefore applies to all geometries .",
    "we consider four variables : @xmath154 , and the additional current @xmath155 flowing along the edge in the boundary strip .",
    "the four parameters are related by a contact impedance matrix @xmath156 , as given by @xmath157 which is analogous to the conductivity tensor in the bulk . due to the low symmetry of the boundary strip ,",
    "all four components of @xmath156 are _ a priori _ independent .",
    "the whole inhomogeneous sample can be thought of as consisting of a homogeneous interior , with the conductivity tensor of the infinite system @xmath81 and with the same dimensions as the original sample , and an infinitesimally thin boundary strip described by the impedance matrix @xmath156 .",
    "we will now determine the boundary strip impedance matrix for a simplified model : a periodic two - phase system in which `` black '' and `` white '' are regularly distributed as in a chessboard , and all vertices have identical scattering properties . since , for a thin boundary strip , the sample shape is not important , we choose to study a convenient geometry , in which the sample is a long rectangle with rows of vertices aligned parallel to its sides .",
    "let the width of the sample be @xmath158 , where @xmath159 is the lattice constant , and @xmath8 is an integer .",
    "a section of a long sample is shown in fig .",

    "thus , as far as non - local resistance measurements are concerned , macroscopic inhomogeneities make the sample effectively wider . in the region of the peak in @xmath295 where @xmath296 , the effective width increases by of order the correlation radius @xmath77 .",
    "notice that the formula ( [ rhoxx ] ) for the measured diagonal resistivity can now be rewritten as @xmath297 which means that effect of inhomogeneities on the `` local '' resistance can be thought of as the same increase in the sample width : @xmath298 .",
    "this immediately gives a simple method by which the edge contribution to @xmath299 can be eliminated to first order in @xmath235 .",
    "first one must measure the `` non - local '' resistance @xmath265 with two pairs of voltage probes situated at different distances @xmath300 ( larger than @xmath109 ) from the current probes .",
    "the effective width can be calculated as    @xmath301 . \\label{weff}\\ ] ]    combined with a knowledge of the geometric sample width @xmath109 this can then be substituted in eq .",
    "( [ xxw ] ) to obtain @xmath302 .",
    "( since precise measurements of the geometric width of the sample @xmath109 may present some difficulties in experiment one may determine it in the same way as @xmath303 , but at @xmath304 when weak inhomogeneities are not important . ) using the same method , we can extract the bulk value of the hall resistivity @xmath305 from observed hall resistance @xmath306 . from eqs .",
    "( [ k ] ) , ( [ rhoyx ] ) we get @xmath307    it is worth emphasizing that when deriving expressions ( [ xxw])-([yxw ] ) , we did not use any particular values for the components of the boundary strip matrix @xmath260 .",
    "this means that the method of compensating the edge effect we just have suggested is rather general and is not restricted to the `` black - and - white '' regime , @xmath67 , studied in secs .",
    "iii and iv .",
    "for instance , the method can be applied just as well at higher temperatures , @xmath308 , when a significant part of the current is carried by the intermediate `` grey '' region in fig .",
    "this seems to be the case in experimental data shown in fig . 3 at high temperatures when @xmath104 decreases with increasing @xmath18 .",
    "relation ( [ xxw ] ) used to compensate the edge effect in the diagonal resistivity is quite universal in the sense that it does not depend on any components of the boundary strip matrix . in order to exclude the edge effect from the hall resistivity using eq .",
    "( [ yxw ] ) , one has to know the specific value of @xmath230 .",
    "we note , however , that the value @xmath309 is more general than its derivation based on the `` black - and - white '' model which we gave in sec .",
    "it merely reflects the symmetry of the local hall resistivity distribution @xmath310 with respect to @xmath311 which is conserved as long as the sample is effectively very inhomogeneous , i.e. @xmath312 .",
    "we emphasize again that this method applies only to first order in @xmath235 .",
    "it yields a partial compensation of the edge effect at @xmath313 , and is useless at @xmath111 when all measured parameters have already saturated in temperature .",
    "our conclusions are easy to test experimentally .",
    "if the underlying model is appropriate in a particular sample , the application of this method should produce a wide range in the temperature dependence of @xmath1 within which the diagrams @xmath5 vs. @xmath2 are close to the `` universal semicircle '' .",
    "in other words , by compensating the edge effects , the maxima in temperature like those shown in fig .",
    "3 can be broadened and brought much closer to @xmath13 . at the lowest temperatures ,",
    "when the finite - size effects dominate the transport properties ( the `` saturation '' regime ) , the method eventually breaks down and no universality can be retrieved .",
    "in fact , such a behavior close to the universal prediction was already observed , without any special methods , in the integer regime in the temperature ranges @xmath314 [ ref.(a ) ] , and @xmath315 [ ref . ] . in these low - mobility samples ,",
    "the high - temperature decrease of the peak heights starts late when the size effects are already small .",
    "we have shown that low - temperature measurements of the quantum hall effect in inter - plateau regions are very sensitive to even weak macroscopic density inhomogeneities in the sample .",
    "the inhomogeneities may result in strong finite - size effects even in samples which , from a conventional point of view , are very large .",
    "this may be a reason why the predicted universal behavior of the transition regions in an infinite macroscopically homogeneous system is so hard to observe experimentally . within our model of macroscopic inhomogeneities",
    ", we were able to account for both the decrease of the conductivity peak heights at low temperatures and the curious `` non - universal '' scaling of the peak heights revealed in some samples .",
    "in the low - temperature limit , the experimentally observed peaks in @xmath5 in the corbino geometry are shown to saturate at values proportional to the differences between adjacent plateaus in @xmath2 .",
    "( analogously , the peaks in @xmath17 observed in the hall bar should be proportional to differences in @xmath316 . )",
    "the proportionality factor depends on the specific realization of disorder and fluctuates strongly between samples .",
    "the model also predicts unusual peak shapes which show quantized plateaus in the _ longitudinal _ conductivity .",
    "the experimental peak heights obtained in ref . at the lowest temperatures are consistent with this quantization .",
    "finally , we also showed that for a hall bar with a sharp edge , there exist simple relations between the enhanced non - local resistance and the size corrections in @xmath3 and @xmath4 when these corrections are small .",
    "these relations can be used to separate the edge effects from the bulk tensor components @xmath302 and @xmath317 .",
    "in this appendix , we calculate the effective resistance @xmath318 of a fork vertex , a relatively simple example of which is shown in fig .",
    "the current distribution in the vertex is shown by the arrows which denote beams of current lines .",
    "the beams split and focus at `` simple '' 3- and 4-vertices which form the fork vertex .",
    "( recall that , since the longitudinal conductivity is assumed to be vanishingly small in black and white regions , the current lines can not cross the border between phases or the metal boundary other then at these simple vertices . ) the effective resistance @xmath318 can be found from the net joule heat @xmath319 , where @xmath155 is the net current entering the metal contact .",
    "although the problem would appear quite complex , it turns out that the dissipated heat does not depend on the specific structure of the vertex .",
    "we will now show this from very general arguments .",
    "let us draw an imaginary circle ( the dashed line in fig .",
    "2b ) enclosing all of the structure of the vertex .",
    "consider the total currents @xmath320 , and @xmath155 crossing this circle in the black , white , and metallic areas , respectively . from the current continuity condition , @xmath321 , and from the condition that electric potentials at points 1 , 3 of the metal boundary must be equal , @xmath322",
    ", we find @xmath323 that is , only one of the three currents is an independent quantity .        where @xmath325 and @xmath326 are the local electric field and the local current density , respectively , at point @xmath327 inside of the circle . since @xmath328",
    ", we can express @xmath329 in terms of the pseudoscalar @xmath249 , and @xmath330 in terms of the electric potential @xmath256 , as given by @xmath246 , \\ \\",
    "{ \\bbox e}({\\bbox r})=-\\nabla\\phi({\\bbox r } ) .",
    "\\label{psi1}\\ ] ] in this notation , the three currents @xmath331 can be written as          where the integral is taken along the closed circle in fig .",
    "the circle can be broken into three segments : 3 - 2 , 2 - 1 , and 1 - 3 . within each of the segments we have @xmath334 , where the hall conductivity @xmath335 is equal to @xmath336 , and @xmath337 ( metal ) , respectively .",
    "integration within separate segments yields            note , that if the colors in fig .",
    "2b are interchanged , which corresponds to interchanging @xmath10 and @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( [ qqfin ] ) , the joule heat will be negative ( recall that we assume @xmath177 everywhere in the paper ) .",
    "since this would contradict the second law of thermodynamics , for such a vertex , all currents must be zero .",
    "hence , only the vertices for which the rightmost color , as shown in fig .",
    "2b , is white , can be `` active '' ( can participate in the current transfer ) .    to illustrate our result ( [ r3 ] ) , consider the simplest ( without branching ) example of a 3-vertex presented by a corner of a rectangular homogeneous conductor with the hall conductivity @xmath10 .",
    "two metallic probes are attached at the bottom and at the top of the rectangle , the sample on the left and on the right bordering to vacuum , @xmath340 .",
    "if @xmath341 , the current will leave and enter metallic probes focusing at the lower left and the upper right corners of the sample which represent the active 3-vertices .",
    "the two - terminal resistance of such a sample is equal , as easy to see , to the inverse hall conductivity @xmath342 .",
    "this amounts to the effective resistance @xmath343 per each active 3-vertex , in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ r3 ] ) .",
    "as is easy to check , the same rule of selection of active vertices applies if the metal in fig .",
    "2b is replaced by a vacuum , as is appropriate for a hall bar with an abrupt edge ( sec .",
    "in contrast to the edge to metal discussed above , we now have zero current out of the edge , @xmath344 , and a non - zero voltage difference @xmath345 .",
    "the expression for the joule heat @xmath346 can be obtained in almost the same manner as eq .",
