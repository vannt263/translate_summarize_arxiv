    "in 1998 , the observations from type ia supernovae ( sn ia ) implied that our universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion @xcite .",
    "meanwhile this accelerated expansion obtains independent supports from the anisotropy measurements of cosmic microwave background ( cmb )  @xcite and the large - scale structure of the universe ( lss )  @xcite .",
    "all these data sets indicate that our universe is currently dominated by an energy component , dubbed as dark energy , which has a negative pressure and provide a repulsive force to push the universe into an accelerating expansion phase .",
    "the main remained energy component is the cold dark matter which provides an attractive force to form the large scale structure of our universe .",
    "but what is the nature of the dark matter and the dark energy ? what are the properties of the dark energy ? to understand the nature of this dark side of our universe , one should use the information from the cosmic observations .",
    "a very exciting new technology of gravitational lensing provides a strong evidence that when the light rays pass through astronomical objects ( galaxies , cluster of galaxies ) , the cosmological gravitation field bends the paths traveled by light from distant source to us .",
    "this fundamental fact carries with it an enormous amount of cosmological promise .",
    "the most important is the idea that light paths respond to the distribution of mass .",
    "therefore , the positions of the source and the image are related through the simple lens equation .",
    "the information of the invisible matter can be deduced by making a thorough inquiry the relation between sources and images .",
    "if one can measure the redshifts of the source and lens , the velocity dispersion of the mass distribution , the separated image , then one might be able to infer the distribution of the mass in our universe .",
    "up to now , the strong gravitational lensing have developed into an important astrophysical tool for probing the cosmology  @xcite , the structure formation and the evolution of galaxies  @xcite .",
    "the observations of the source and image combined with lens model can provide the geometric information of our universe through the ratio between two angular diameter distances @xmath7 ( the angular diameter distance between lens and source ) and @xmath8 ( the angular diameter distance between the observer and the source ) .",
    "then one can use the observed data of @xmath9 to constrain the cosmological models , for example please see @xcite for strong lensing and @xcite for weak lensing systems .    assuming that the gravitational lens can be represented by a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) or singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) potential , the einstein radius in a sis ( or its sie equivalent ) is given as @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath3 is the velocity dispersion and @xmath11",
    "is the speed of light .",
    "of course , this assumption is not good for a general lensing system , for example the weak - lensing , but it is a good approximation especially to the strong lensing system where it has @xmath12 images @xcite .",
    "the reason is that ellipticity in the lens galaxy mainly affects the relative numbers of two- and four- image lenses but not their overall measures @xcite .",
    "it is clear that if the einstein radius @xmath13 and the velocity dispersion @xmath3 are measured through lens system , the two angular diameter distances ratio can be derived to constrain the cosmological model .",
    "acyually , the observed einstein radius @xmath14 can be obtained from sloan lens acs ( slacs ) and lens structure and dynamics survey ( lsd ) .",
    "the big challenge is how to obtain the velocity dispersion @xmath3 .",
    "based on the observations of x - ray , it was argued that there is a strong indication that dark matter halos are dynamically hotter than the luminous stars  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the velocity dispersion @xmath15 of the sis model is different from the observed stellar velocity dispersion @xmath16 .",
    "so to fix the problem , one introduces the relation between the stellar velocity dispersion @xmath2 and the velocity dispersion @xmath3 in the form of @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a free parameter @xcite .",
    "then the problem becomes to how to deal with the free parameter @xmath18 .",
    "it is crucial because it mimics the effects of @xcite : ( i ) the systematic rms errors between @xmath16 and @xmath15 ; ( ii ) the rms error caused by translation the observed image separation into @xmath13 in sis model ; ( iii ) decreasing of the typical image separations due to the softened isothermal sphere potentials @xcite .",
    "the background matter and the richer environments of early type galaxies can affect the images separation by up to @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "it is equivalent to introduce a constant @xmath18 in the range @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , we should mention that the teves / mond theory of gravity also predicts an isothermal rotation curve in galaxies , and the einstein ring and velocity dispersions of the castles lenses have been calculated in teves @xcite .    in order to eliminate the effects and uncertainties caused by the free parameter @xmath18 ,",
    "in this paper , we present a new approach that treats @xmath18 as a `` nuisance '' parameter and harnesses the ratio @xmath0 as cosmic observations to constrain the cosmological model . in this way",
    ", the effects and uncertainties caused by the free parameter @xmath18 are eliminated completely .",
    "we collected the @xmath21 strong gravitational lensing systems from slacs and lsd surveys  @xcite as the data points , for the details please see the table [ list ] .",
    "under the assumption of the sis model @xcite , the einstein radius @xmath22 is given in the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : er ] ) where @xmath23 is the angular diameter distance which is defined as @xmath24\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is @xmath26 for @xmath27 , @xmath28 for @xmath29 and @xmath30 for @xmath31 respectively ; here @xmath32 is the hubble constant and @xmath33 is the dimensionless expansion rate which depends on the redshift @xmath34 and the cosmological parameters * p*. in refs . @xcite , the authors pointed out that the velocity dispersion @xmath15 of the mass distribution and the observation stellar velocity dispersion @xmath16 does not equal but relates via the form ( [ eq : relation ] ) . in the previous work for example",
    "@xcite , @xmath35 was treated as a free model parameter and was found in narrow range of @xmath36 .",
    "so , it would be reasonable to assume it is a constant and try to eliminate it completely . via the relation ( [ eq :",
    "relation ] ) , one can obtain @xmath37 , here @xmath38 for different strong lensing system .",
    "if one defines the ratio @xmath39 , where @xmath40 denote the order numbers of the lensing system as marked in table [ list ] , then one obtains @xmath0 which does not depend on the `` nuisance '' parameter @xmath35 and only relates to the observed data points @xmath22 and @xmath2 for different strong lensing systems .",
    "this is the apparent merit of our methodology .",
    "we should notice that this ratio dose not depend on the hubble parameter .",
    "then it dose not introduce any uncertainty to the results .",
    "but on the other side it loses the power to constrain the cosmological models .    for any strong gravitational lensing system",
    ", one can get the theoretical model ratio by calculating @xmath41 then one can constrain cosmological models by the minimization of @xmath42 function which is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the number of the strong lensing system and @xmath45 denotes the @xmath46 variance of @xmath47 .",
    "the @xmath46 error @xmath45 of @xmath47 can be calculated via the error propagation equation @xmath48 to obtain the cosmological model parameter space , we use the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method .",
    "we modified the publicly available code * cosmomc * @xcite and added one module to calculate the @xmath42 from strong lensing system .",
    "we ran @xmath49-chains and stopped sampling when the worst e - values [ the variance(mean)/mean(variance ) of 1/2 chains ] @xmath50 is of the order @xmath51 .",
    "in the simplest @xmath4cdm model , the dark energy is a cosmological constant @xmath4 which has a constant equation of state ( eos ) @xmath52 . for this simple cosmological model , the hubble parameter free expansion rate",
    "is written as @xmath53 where @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the dimensionless energy density for the cold dark matter , spatial curvature and the cosmological constant respectively . in this model",
    ", we will consider the spatially flat and non - flat cases respectively .",
    "for the spatially flat case , it has only one free model parameter : @xmath57 . for the non - flat case , it has the model parameter : @xmath58 .",
    "the results are shown in the table [ tab : resultslcdm ] and the figure [ fig : lcdm ] .",
    "likelihood distribution and @xmath59 contour plot for @xmath4cdm model .",
    "the up and bottom panels are for the flat and non - flat cases respectively.,title=\"fig:\",width=529 ]   likelihood distribution and @xmath59 contour plot for @xmath4cdm model .",
    "the up and bottom panels are for the flat and non - flat cases respectively.,title=\"fig:\",width=529 ]    allowing for a deviation from the simple @xmath60 case , for the dark energy with a constant eos @xmath61 , one has the hubble free expansion rate in the following form @xmath62 where @xmath63 .",
    "it has two free model parameters @xmath64 for the flat case and three model parameters @xmath65 for the non - flat case .",
    "the corresponding results are shown in the table [ tab : resultswcdm ] and the figure [ fig : lwmb ] .",
    "likelihood and @xmath59 contour plots for @xmath61cdm model .",
    "the up and bottom panels are for the flat and non - flat cases respectively.,title=\"fig:\",width=529 ]   likelihood and @xmath59 contour plots for @xmath61cdm model .",
    "the up and bottom panels are for the flat and non - flat cases respectively.,title=\"fig:\",width=529 ]    by comparison to the results as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , our method can give a relative tight constraint to the cosmological model parameter space .",
    "but the effects caused by @xmath66 are removed completely . and , via our method , the spatial curvature can also be constrained . to compare our results to that from sn ia union2.1 @xcite , we reran the code and found the corresponding results : @xmath67 for the flat @xmath4cdm model and @xmath68 and @xmath69 for the flat @xmath61cdm model respectively .",
    "clearly , our results are compatible with that from sn ia .",
    "but the strong lensing system favor lower values of @xmath54 .",
    "in this paper , we present a new method to use the strong lensing system to constrain the cosmological models . assuming that the gravitation lens can be represented by a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) or singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) potential , we eliminated completely the uncertainty caused by @xmath35 which characterizes the relation between the stellar velocity dispersion @xmath2 and the velocity dispersion @xmath3 . by taking the ratios of @xmath0 as cosmic observations",
    ", one can constrain the cosmological model parameter space very well . and",
    "it can be used to probe the nature of dark energy and the spatial curvature of our universe .",
