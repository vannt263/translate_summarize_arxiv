    "blood flowing through vessels forms paths of fast heat transport in living tissue and under typical conditions it is blood flow that governs heat propagation on scales about or greater than one centimeter ( for an introduction to this problem see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "blood vessels make up a complex network being practically a fractal .",
    "the larger is a vessel , the faster is the blood motion in it and , so , the stronger is the effect of blood flow in the given vessel on heat transfer .",
    "blood flow in capillaries practically does not affect heat propagation whereas blood inside large vessels moves so fast that its heat interaction with the surrounding cellular tissue is ignorable @xcite .",
    "thus , there should be vessels of a certain length @xmath0 that are the smallest ones among the vessels wherein blood flow affects heat transfer remarkably .",
    "the value of @xmath0 can be estimated as @xcite ( see also @xcite ) : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the temperature diffusivity of the cellular tissue determined by its thermal conductivity @xmath3 , specific heat @xmath4 , and density @xmath5 , the value @xmath6 is the blood perfusion rate ( the volume of blood going through tissue region of unit volume per unit time ) , and the factor @xmath7 is logarithm of the mean ratio of the individual length to radius of blood vessels forming peripheral circulation . for the vascular networks made up of the paired artery and vein trees where all the vessels are grouped into the pairs of the closely - spaced arteries and veins with opposite blood currents the coefficient @xmath8 accounts for the counter - current effect .",
    "was phenomenologically introduced in the bioheat equation to take into account a certain renormalization of the blood perfusion rate caused by the counter - current effect @xcite .",
    "its theoretical estimate was later obtained independently by weinbaum _",
    "_ @xcite and gafiychuk  &  lubashevsky @xcite ( announced for the first time in @xcite ) . ] for the vascular networks where the artery and vein trees are arranged independently of each other the factor @xmath9 should be set equal to unity , @xmath10 .",
    "in particular , for the typical values of the ratio @xmath1140 @xcite , the thermal conductivity @xmath12 w/@xmath13k , the heat capacity @xmath14j / g@xmath15 k , and the density @xmath16 g/@xmath17 of the tissue as well as setting the blood perfusion rate @xmath18min@xmath19 from ( [ thc : e1.4 ] ) we get the estimates @xmath20  mm and @xmath21 .    in the mean - field approximation",
    "the effect of blood flow on heat transfer is reduced to the renormalization of the temperature diffusivity , @xmath22 , @xcite and the appearance of the effective heat sink @xmath23 @xcite in the bioheat equation : @xmath24 here @xmath25 is the tissue temperature field averaged over scales about @xmath26 , the parameter @xmath27 is the blood temperature insider the systemic circulation arteries , and the summand @xmath28 called below the temperature generation rate is specified by the heat generation rate @xmath29 as @xmath30 .",
    "the renormalization of the temperature diffusivity is mainly determined by the blood vessels of lengths about @xmath26 and due to the fractal structure of vascular networks the renormalization coefficient @xmath31 is practically a constant of unity order , @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "let us imitate the temperature evolution in terms of random walks whose concentration is @xmath33 .",
    "then the part of the vein tree made up of vessels whose lengths exceed or are about the scale @xmath0 forms the system of traps .",
    "in fact , blood streams going through the vein tree merge into greater streams at the nodes ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "therefore an effective random walker after reaching the boundary of one of these veins inevitably will be moved by blood flow into the internal points of large veins .",
    "then , due to relatively fast blood motion inside these veins it will be carried away from the tissue region under consideration , which may be described in terms of the walker trapping or , what is the same , the heat sink @xcite . since the mean distance between these veins is determined mainly by the shortest ones , i.e. by the veins of length @xmath34 the mean time during which a walker wanders inside the cellular tissue before being trapped is @xcite @xmath35 in obtaining the given expression we have assumed the vascular network to be embedded uniformly in the cellular tissue , so the tissue volume @xmath36 falls per one vein ( and artery , respectively ) of length @xmath34 . whence it follows , in particular , that the rate at which the walkers are being trapped by these vein , i.e. the rate of their disappearance is estimated as @xmath37 , leading together with expression  ( [ thc : e1.4 ] ) to the heat sink of intensity @xmath23 in the bioheat equation  ( [ eq : bh ] ) .",
    "the characteristic spatial scale of walker diffusion in the cellular tissue before being trapped is @xmath38 , i.e. @xmath39 the scale @xmath40 gives us also the mean penetration depth of heat penetration into the cellular tissue from a point source or , what is the same , the widening of the temperature distribution caused by heat diffusion in the cellular tissue .",
    "it is the result obtained within the mean - field approximation .    beyond the scope of the mean - field theory we meet several phenomena .",
    "one of them is the temperature nonuniformities caused by the vessel discreteness @xcite which can be described assuming the heat sink in equation  ( [ eq : bh ] ) to contain a random component @xcite .",
    "another is fast heat transport over scales exceeding substantially the length @xmath40 caused by the effect of blood flow through the artery tree .",
    "the latter phenomena is the main subject of the present paper .",
    "let at a certain time a random walker wandering in the cellular tissue get a boundary of a large artery , i.e. an artery of length exceeding @xmath0 .",
    "it should be noted that such an event is of low probability and can not be considered within the standard mean - field approximation because the relative number of large arteries is small . due to the direction of the blood motion from larger arteries to smaller ones as well as the high blood flow rate in the large arteries",
    "the walker will be transported fast to one of the arteries of length @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the blood flow rate in small vessels is not high enough to affect the walker motion essentially and it has inevitably to leave this artery and wander in the cellular tissue until being trapped by the veins of length @xmath0 .",
    "thereby a certain not too large number of random walkers generated , for example , inside a cellular tissue neighborhood of a point @xmath41 can be found during the time @xmath42 inside a cellular tissue neighborhood of a point @xmath43 at a distance much larger than @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath44 . the given effect may be regarded as anomalously fast heat diffusion in living tissue , i.e. heat superdiffusion .    dealing with heat transfer in living tissue",
    "we may confine our consideration to the peripheral vascular networks typically embedded uniformly into the cellular tissue , at least at the first approximation @xcite .",
    "the latter statement means , in particular , the fact that for a fixed peripheral vascular network the vessel collection comprising all the arteries of length @xmath45 meets the condition of the volume @xmath46 approximately falling per each one of these arteries . therefore as is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] a walker going into a large artery of length @xmath45 at initial time during the time @xmath47 before being trapped by the veins can be found equiprobably at each point of the given artery neighborhood of size @xmath45 . in other words",
    ", this walker makes a large jump of length @xmath45 that exceeds substantially the mean - field diffusion length @xmath40 .    in what follows",
    "we will analyze the temperature distribution averaged over all the possible realizations of the vascular network embedding .",
    "this enables us to regard a walker entering a large artery of length @xmath45 as a random event whose probability is independent of the walker initial position .",
    "thereby , the probability @xmath48 for a walker to make a large jump over the distance @xmath45 is also independent of the spatial coordinates @xmath41 .",
    "it should be noted that for a fixed realization of the vascular network embedding the probability @xmath48 depends essentially on the spatial coordinates @xmath41 and the heat transfer in living tissue on large scales has to exhibit substantial dependence on the specific position of the heat sources .",
    "now we estimate the value of @xmath48 assuming the heat sources to be localized inside a domain @xmath49 of size @xmath50 .",
    "two different factors determine the value of @xmath48 .",
    "first , it is the process of walker trapping by an artery of length @xmath51 @xmath50 going through the domain @xmath49 . if @xmath52 @xmath50 blood flow in this artery has practically no effect on heat diffusion . on the average a random walker during the time @xmath42 travels the distance @xmath40 in the cellular tissue until being trapped by the veins of length @xmath0 .",
    "so for a walker to enter this artery and , thus , to leave the domain @xmath49 with blood flow in it the walker , on one hand , should be located at initial time inside a cylindrical neighborhood @xmath53 of the given artery whose radius is about @xmath40 and the volume is @xmath54 . on the other hand , it has to avoid being trapped by the veins of length @xmath0 .",
    "the probability of the latter event is about @xmath55 .",
    "indeed , a vein of length @xmath56 may be treated as a trap of cylindrical form .",
    "thereby in qualitative analysis the walker trapping can be described in terms of two - dimensional random walks in the plane perpendicular to the artery under consideration where the trapping veins are represented by small circular regions .",
    "their density is about @xmath57 which directly leads to the latter estimate .",
    "therefore the total number of walkers leaving the domain @xmath49 with blood flow through the given artery per unit time is @xmath58 in obtaining  ( [ add1 ] ) we have taken into account expression  ( [ eq : tau ] ) . since the trapped walkers spread uniformly over a region of size @xmath45 the resulting density of the walker transition rate to a point @xmath41 spaced at a distance about @xmath45 from the domain @xmath49",
    "is @xmath59 it should be noted that the transition rate @xmath60 , as it must , does not depend on the local value of blood perfusion rate .    at the second step we should average the obtained transition rate @xmath60 over the possible realizations of the vascular network embedding .",
    "let us adopt a simplified model for the vascular network shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3]@xmath61 where the vessel lengths @xmath62 and @xmath63 of the neighboring hierarchy levels @xmath64 and @xmath65 are related as @xmath66 .",
    "figure  [ fig3]@xmath67 demonstrates a more adequate model for the peripheral artery tree which , however , within the framework of the present qualitative analysis may be reduced to the former one by combining three sequent two - fold nodes into one effective four - fold node at all the levels . in this case",
    "the cubic domain of volume @xmath68 falls per each artery of level @xmath64 .",
    "let us now consider individually three characteristic forms of the domain @xmath49 , a ball or a cube of size @xmath50 ( @xmath69 ) , an infinitely long cylinder of radius @xmath50 ( @xmath70 ) , and a plane layer of thickness @xmath50 ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "for the ball or the cube , i.e. a region bounded in three dimensions the probability that an artery of level @xmath64 passes through the domain @xmath49 is about @xmath72 for the infinitely long cylinder @xmath73 and for the plane layer @xmath74 .",
    "multiplying @xmath60 by the corresponding values of @xmath75 we get the result of averaging the walker transition rate @xmath60 over the possible realizations of the vascular network embedding .",
    "the obtained result is written as @xmath76 where the value @xmath77 actually plays the role of the dimension of the space inside which the temperature field can be considered . at the next step we should sum the terms  ( [ 90 ] ) over all the levels of the large artery tree .",
    "however due to the strong increase of the terms  ( [ 90 ] ) , @xmath78 , as the level number @xmath64 increases the arteries of length @xmath79 mainly contribute to the value of @xmath80 .",
    "so the term describing the fast heat transport with blood flow through large arteries from the domain @xmath49 ( located near the origin of the coordinate system ) can be written as @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the region containing the peripheral vascular network as a whole and the integration in the three dimensional space over the domain @xmath49 allows for all its three considered types .    ) four - fold node model used in the present analysis and ( @xmath67 ) a more realistic dichotomic artery tree uniformly embedded into a cellular tissue domain @xmath82 . in the qualitative description of heat transfer both the models lead to the same result.[fig3],width=302 ]    expression ( [ opla ] ) together with the mean - filed bioheat equation  ( [ eq : bh ] ) enables us to write the following equation governing the anomalous heat transfer in living tissue @xmath83 where we have added directly the value @xmath0 in order to cut off the spatial scales smaller than the length @xmath0 and ignored the difference between the effective temperature diffusivity and the true one of the cellular tissue .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : final ] ) is the desired governing equation of the anomalous fast heat diffusion in living tissue for the averaged temperature field .",
    "it should be noted that the second term on the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : final ] ) depends weakly on the blood perfusion rate .",
    "therefore , for the nonuniform distribution of the blood perfusion rate @xmath84 equation  ( [ eq : final ] ) holds also .",
    "hyperthermia treatment as well as thermotherapy of small tumors of size about or less 1  cm is related to local strong heating of living tissue up to temperatures about 45@xmath85c or higher values . in this case",
    "the tissue region heated directly , for example , by laser irradiation is also of a similar size . due to the tissue response to such strong heating",
    "the blood perfusion rate can grow tenfold locally whereas in the neighboring regions the blood perfusion rate remains practically unchanged @xcite .",
    "the feasibility of such nonuniform distribution of the blood perfusion rate may be explained applying to the cooperative mechanism of self - regulation in hierarchically organized active media @xcite .",
    "therefore in the region affected directly the blood perfusion rate @xmath86 can exceed the blood perfusion rate @xmath87 in the surrounding tissue substantially . in this case",
    "the characteristic length of heat diffusion into the surrounding tissue is about @xmath88 giving us also the minimal size @xmath89 of the region wherein the tissue temperature increase @xmath90 is mainly localized . in the neighboring tissue",
    "the blood perfusion rate keeps up a sufficiently low value @xmath87 , which makes the heat propagation with blood flow through large arteries considerable .",
    "indeed , let us estimate the temperature increase caused by this effect using the obtained equation  ( [ eq : final ] ) .",
    "the temperature increase @xmath91 at a point spaced at the distance @xmath92 from the region ( of size @xmath50 ) affected directly , i.e. the tail of the temperature distribution is mainly determined by the anomalous heat diffusion and , so , is estimated by the expression @xmath93 as seen from ( [ haha ] ) for a sufficiently local and strong heating of the tissue , i.e. when @xmath94 and @xmath95 the temperature increase at not too distant points such that @xmath96 @xmath50 can be considerable .",
    "otherwise the anomalous heat diffusion is ignorable .",
