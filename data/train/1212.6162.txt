    "when a grounded conducting ball is installed on the axis of an external axial harmonic field , an induced charge arises on its surface .",
    "it shields the initial field so that the total potential of exterior and shielded fields inside the ball be equal to zero .",
    "if the potential of the ball with radius @xmath0 is equal to @xmath1 , then the distribution of the charge density on its surface will differ from that of a grounded ball on a constant , that is equal to @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is electric constant .",
    "the density of a surface charge and the dipole moment of a ball in a homogeneous electric field are well known ( see , for example , [ 1 ] ) .",
    "we propose the new efficient method for determining the surface charge density of a conducting ball in an inhomogeneous electric field .",
    "the required density is the solution of a one - dimensional integral equation , when the external field is a harmonic in the ball s volume . from here we obtain the analytical solution for the charge density in the case when the external field potential is a polynomial of arbitrary order on the axis of symmetry .",
    "the three theorems are proved .",
    "the first one consists of the two statements .",
    "the charge of the ball is fully determined by the value of potential of the external field at the center of the ball .",
    "the dipole moment of the ball is fully determined by the value of the external field intensity at the center of the ball .",
    "the second theorem is a generalization the first one and it declares that the dipole moment of @xmath4 order of the ball is fully determined by the values of the first @xmath5 even derivatives from the potential at the ball s center , and the dipole moment of @xmath6 order of the ball is fully determined by the values of the first @xmath5 odd derivatives from the potential at the ball s center . in the third theorem , we find the analytical form for the force acting on the ball when the axial potential of external field is a polynomial . in appendix , we present and prove properties of the matrix of moments of the legendre polynomials that are necessary for proving all the theorems . in particular , these are lemmas about linear dependence and orthogonality .",
    "we obtain explicit expressions for the entries of the inverse matrix .",
    "this circumstance allows one to find the surface charge density analytically .",
    "the investigations presented in appendix could be of special interest in theory of orthogonal polynomials . by this reason",
    ", formulas in appendix are given with independent double numeration .",
    "the potential of the electric field @xmath7 , when it is disturbed by a conducting body , is equal to the sum @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the potential of the external initial field , and @xmath10 is the potential generated by surface charges of the body .",
    "the potential @xmath11 is determined by the formula @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a coordinate on the surface @xmath14 of the body , @xmath15 is the surface charge density that provides the equipotentiality of the surface @xmath14 .",
    "the axially symmetric initial electric potential @xmath16 induces the axially symmetric distribution of the surface charges @xmath17 on the surface of a conducting axially symmetric body .",
    "these charges generate the following potential on the axis of the electric field at a point @xmath18 @xmath19 where @xmath20 is an element of length of the generator line of the body of revolution , @xmath21 is a radius of the cross - section of the body at a distance @xmath22 from the origin , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are coordinates of the intersection of the axis of symmetry with the body surface . if the electric potential @xmath25 compensates the initial potential @xmath26 on the axis , then the total potential inside the body will be equal to zero not only on the axis , but also on the whole volume of the body , because every component of the potential satisfies the laplace equation [ 2 ] .",
    "for a conducting ball with a radius @xmath0 , placed on the axis in the external electric field , equation ( 2 ) takes the form @xmath27 let us consider dimensionless variables @xmath28 , @xmath29 . then equation ( 3 )",
    "can be written down as @xmath30 if @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a natural number , then , integrating the left - hand side in ( 4 ) , we obtain , using the mathematical induction , a polynomial of @xmath32 degree also in the right - hand side depending on the variable @xmath33 . therefore when the right - hand side in equation ( 4 ) varies along the axis as a polynomial of @xmath32 degree @xmath34 then @xmath35 is also a polynomial of @xmath32 degree @xmath36 with the coefficients @xmath37 that can be determined from the equation @xmath38 where @xmath39 @xmath40 , and the matrix @xmath41 is an upper triangular one .",
    "the nonzero entries in this matrix are equal to @xmath42 then the matrix @xmath43 will also be the upper triangular one .    let the potential of an external electric field vary along the axis as a polynomial of @xmath32 degree @xmath44 then the density of a surface charge is a polynomial of the same degree @xmath45 and the coefficients can be determined from the equation @xmath46 hence , the required coefficients can be found in the explicit form @xmath47 or @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and entries of the matrix @xmath52 are determined by a simple equality @xmath53 , @xmath40 .    the explicit form of entries of the matrix @xmath54 is found in appendix ( property 8) . hence , the density of a surface charge in the explicit form can be found , when the potential of an external electric field on the axis is a polynomial of an arbitrary degree .",
    "the full charge @xmath55 and dipole moment @xmath56 of a conducting ball with radius @xmath0 on the axis of the axially symmetric electric field are determined by the formulas @xmath57 @xmath58 if the potential of the external field is a linear function on the axis of symmetry @xmath59 , then from ( 7 ) and ( 10 ) we obtain @xmath60 from property 8 ( appendix ) , which determines the entries of the inverse matrix @xmath54 , one can easily obtain @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "thus , from formulas ( 11)-(13 ) we obtain @xmath63 @xmath64    * the full charge and dipole moment of a conducting ball are determined by formulas ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) in any external axially symmetric field that is harmonic inside the ball . *    _ proof .",

    "assume that formulas ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) are valid provided that the potential @xmath65 is a polynomial of @xmath66 degree .",
    "this means that such equalities are valid for polynomials @xmath17 of @xmath66 degree , with coefficients that are determined from the solution of a system of linear equations of order @xmath32 with an arbitrary right - hand side , where entries of the matrix @xmath41 are determined by equalities ( 5 ) .",

    "* formulas ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) are valid for any external harmonic fields that are not necessarily axially symmetric fields . *    _ proof . _",
    "the electric field , generated by a point charge is always axially symmetric for the ball , when the axis passes through its center and this charge .",
    "then any distribution of point charges excites axial fields with axes passing through the center of the ball .",
    "since theorem 1 is also valid for the sum of electric fields with axes passing through the center of the ball and , since an electric field can always be presented as superposition of point charges , then theorem 1 is valid for any electric field .",
    "now let us discuss the deduction of the formula for the dipole moment of a conducting ball of @xmath83 order , which is determined by the formula @xmath84    * the dipole moment of the ball of @xmath83 * _ order _ , * * _ when the potential of the external field _ * @xmath85**_on the axis of symmetry is a polynomial of _ * * @xmath32 * _ degree is equal to _ * @xmath86 * _ where _ * @xmath87 * _ if _ * @xmath83 * _ is even and _ * @xmath88 * _ if _ * @xmath83 * _ is odd .",
    "_ * *    in formula ( 24 ) and further the index `` ( 2 ) '' in the lower part of the sum symbol means that summation is carried out with a step equal to 2 .",
