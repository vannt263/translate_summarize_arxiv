    "water , due to its abundance on the planet and its role in many of the organic and inorganic chemical processes , has been studied extensively and for decades both at the theoretical and at the experimental level @xcite@xmath0@xcite .",
    "the peculiar interplay of hydrogen bonding , glassy behavior , and of quantum - mechanical effects on the dynamics of the atomic nuclei make computer simulations challenging , and a great effort has been expended to build a comprehensive and consistent microscopic picture , and a link with observed macroscopic properties @xcite@xmath0@xcite . additionally , it is only recently that close agreement for fundamental structural information such as the radial distribution function has been obtained between different experimental techniques , such as x - ray @xcite and neutron diffraction @xcite measurements .",
    "computational studies based on molecular dynamics simulations have also a rich history in the field .",
    "simulations using force - fields models@xcite@xmath0@xcite have been successful at reproducing many structural and dynamical properties of liquid water . however , empirical models rely on parameters which are determined by fits to known experimental data , or occasionally to ab - initio results . their transferability to different environments , or the ability to reproduce faithfully the microscopic characteristics of hydrogen bonding , are often in question .",
    "due to development of novel techniques @xcite@xmath1@xcite and the ever - increasing improvement in computational power , extensive molecular - dynamics simulations from first - principles are now possible .",
    "the increased accuracy and predictive power of these simulations comes at a significant price , and careful considerations has to be given to the length scales and time scales that can be afforded in a first - principle simulation , and the trade - offs in statistical errors when compared with classical simulations .",
    "numerous ab - initio simulations on water have appeared @xcite@xmath0@xcite , showing good agreement with experiments for the structural and dynamical data .",
    "recent results have also reported @xcite@xmath1@xcite that careful equilibration for ab - initio water at ambient conditions leads to radial distribution functions over - structured in comparison with experiments @xcite .",
    "after equilibration , the numerical estimates for the diffusion coefficient become at least one order of magnitude smaller than the measured ones .",
    "prompted by these results and by our own observations on the structure of water around iron aqua ions @xcite , we have undertaken an extensive investigation of the static and dynamical properties of water , to ascertain its phase stability around ambient conditions as predicted by first - principles molecular dynamics .",
    "particular care has been given to the statistical accuracy of the results , assuring that the time scales and length scales of the simulations were chosen appropriately for the given conditions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we detail all the technical aspects of our simulations . section iii surveys the static and vibrational properties of the water molecule and the water dimer in vacuum , at the gga - pbe @xcite density - functional level . in section iv",
    ", we discuss our extensive liquid water simulations , performed with car - parrinello molecular dynamics , in the temperature range between 325 k and 400 k. section v discusses the limitations of this approach , and some of the possible reasons to explain the remaining discrepancies with experimental results .",
    "our first - principles calculations are based on density - functional theory , periodic - boundary conditions , plane - wave basis sets , and norm - conserving @xcite or ultrasoft pseudopotentials @xcite to represent the ion - electron interactions , as implemented in the public domain codes cp and pwscf in the @xmath2-espresso package @xcite .    in car - parrinello",

    "an extensive review of the method can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ; the subtle technical issues arising in the simulations of liquid water have been discussed in the recent literature @xcite@xmath1@xcite .",
    "we note in passing that our simulations parameters agree with the recommendations set forth in these latter papers .",
    "it should be stressed that full convergence of the forces acting on the nuclei with respect to the basis set is easily achieved with plane waves , and no pulay forces arise in the dynamics , since the basis set is independent from the atomic positions .",
    "the structural and vibrational properties of the water monomer and dimer and the binding energy of the dimer have been calculated using density - functional theory in the generalized - gradient approximation and the total energy pseudopotential method , and density - functional perturbation theory @xcite , as implemented in pwscf .",
    "we performed separate calculations using either norm - conserving pseudopotentials for both the hydrogen and the oxygen , or ultrasoft ones .",
    "these same pseudopotentials were also used for the norm - conserving or ultrasoft molecular dynamics simulations . in particular ,",
    "the o troullier - martins norm - conserving pseudopotential was generated using the fhi98pp package @xcite with core radii for the @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 components of 1.25 a.u .",

    "there are several possible reasons for the overestimation of the freezing temperature of water , and several of them could play a significant role .",
    "we discuss here some of the possibilities .",
    "since our simulation cell contains only 32 water molecules , finite - size effects could obviously play a role even if periodic - boundary conditions are used .",
    "the interactions of water molecules with their periodic images could be considerable due to the long - range hydrogen - bond network .",
    "on the other hand , when zero correlations are found between a molecule and its periodic image we can safely assume that the unit cell is for all practical purposes large enough , and every molecule feels the same environment that it would have in an infinite system . in our case ,",
    "the distance between a molecule and its eight periodic images is @xmath13 11  and at this distance all radial distribution functions look very flat and unstructured . in any case , to study the finite - size effects we carried out another extensive simulation ( 40 ps total , with 15 ps of production time following 25 ps of thermalization ) for a system composed of 64 heavy water molecules at 400 k. we used the same parameters for this simulation as in the 32-molecule , 400 k ultrasoft simulation .",
    "the oxygen - oxygen radial distribution function @xmath14(r ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ 64_32 ] for both the 32- and 64-molecule systems .",
    "as mentioned previously , the radial distribution functions was calculated by repeating the unit cell in all directions .",
    "the molecules up to 5.5   in the 32-molecule cell , and 6.9   in the 64-molecule cell are inequivalent .",
    "we indicate in the graphs with two arrows , the radii of the spheres completely inscribed by in bcc simulation cells .",
    "differences between 32- and 64-molecule systems are negligible , and within the variance for simulations of the order of 10 - 20 ps ( as estimated from uncorrelated classical simulation data@xcite ) ; the 64-water simulation shows a marginally more structured @xmath15 where the first peak height is at about 2.6 ( compared to 2.5 for the 32-water case ) .",
    "larger ab - initio simulations would be too demanding ; for this reason , we performed two classical simulations at 300 k using the spc force field @xcite for water , and comparing the case of 64 and 1000 water molecules ( each simulation lasting 1000 ps ) .",
    "the @xmath14(r ) calculated from these two runs are shown in fig .",
    "[ classical ] , and again we do not find any significant differences between these two curves .",
    "these results help ruling out finite - size effects as the major cause of the discrepancy observed with the experimental numbers .",
    "while density - functional theory is in principle exact , any practical application requires an approximated guess to the true exchange - correlation functional . in this work ,",
    "we have used the gga - pbe approach @xcite . as it was observed in sec .",
    "iii , the structural properties for the water molecule and dimer are in excellent agreement with experiments , as is the binding energy for the dimer .",
    "on the other hand , the vibrational properties show larger discrepancies with experiments than usually expected , in particular for some of the libration modes in the dimer .",
    "this result certainly points to the need for improved functionals to describe hydrogen bonding .",
    "the dependence of the melting point on the exchange - correlation functional chosen is more subtle ; below 400 k , pbe water displays solid - like oxygen - oxygen radial distribution functions that are only slightly affected by the temperature , and that are similar to those obtained with a fairly different functional such as blyp @xcite .",
    "the similarity between these radial distribution functions is just a reminder that the structural property and the geometry of the intermolecular bonds are well described by different functionals ; once water is `` frozen '' , all radial distribution functions will look similar",
    ". the temperature at which this transition takes place could be affected by the use of different functionals @xcite and the magnitude of the contribution of any one of them to the melting point temperature is still open to investigation .      in first - principles car - parrinello or born - oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations",
    "the ions are most often treated as classical particles , which is a good approximation for heavy ions ( path - integral simulations can describe the quantum nature of the ions @xcite@xmath0@xcite , but their computational costs , when paired with a first - principles dft descriptions of the electrons , preclude at this moment simulations with the statistical accuracy needed ) .",
    "however , for light ions like hydrogen or deuterium , the effects of a proper quantum statistics can be very significant ; tunneling of the nuclei can also affect the dynamics @xcite@xmath1@xcite . in the case of water ,",
    "all the intramolecular vibrational modes and some of the intermolecular modes are much higher in energy compared to room temperature . we show in fig .",
    "[ hpowsp ] the power spectrum for the deuterium atoms as calculated from the velocity - velocity correlation function of heavy water molecules for our simulations at 400 k ( ultrasoft , 32 molecules ) .",
    "the distinctive peaks of the intramolecular stretching and bending modes are centered around 2400 @xmath16 and 1200 @xmath16 respectively , much higher than the room temperature of @xmath17 200 @xmath16 .",
    "the peak at 500 @xmath16 corresponds to the intermolecular vibrational modes , also larger than @xmath18 .",
    "when ions are treated as classical particles , as in our ab - initio molecular dynamics simulations , all vibrational modes obey boltzmann statistics . in reality , modes with frequency higher than @xmath18 are frozen in their zero - point motion state , and their exchange of energy with the lower - frequency modes ( `` the environment '' ) is suppressed - in other words their contribution to the specific heat is zero , in full analogy with the low - temperature discrepancies from the dulong - petit law in solids .",
    "this effect could significantly affect the dynamics of water - water interactions , and it has long been argued that treating each water molecule as a rigid body could actually provide a closer match with experimental conditions .",
    "in fact , recent ab - initio simulations @xcite in which the water molecules are constrained to maintain their equilibrium intramolecular bond lengths and bond angle result in a more diffusive and less structured description of water , that remains liquid at a temperature of 326 k. path - integral simulation @xcite for water described with classical potentials did find as well a significant difference due to the quantum effects ( i.e. the freezing of the high - energy vibrational excitation ) , of the order of 50k .",
    "we performed extensive first - principles molecular dynamics simulations of heavy water at the dft - pbe level .",
    "equilibration times are found to be comparatively long , and easily in excess of @xmath19 10 ps at ambient temperature .",
    "good statistics was obtained with simulations that included at least 25 ps of thermalization time , followed by 20 to 40 ps of production time . at ambient temperature , water is found to be over - structured compared to experiment , and with a diffusivity that is one order of magnitude smaller than expected .",
    "an abrupt change in the structure and dynamics is observed when the the temperature is raised from 375 k to 400 k ; even at this high temperature , where a liquid - like state is reached , water shows more structure and less diffusivity than found experimentally at room temperature .",
    "these results are broadly independent of some of the possible errors or inaccuracies involved in first - principles simulations , including in this case finite - size effects , insufficient thermalization or simulation times , or poorly designed pseudopotentials .",
    "our simulations suggest that the freezing point is around 400 k - this discrepancy is at variance with the good agreement for the structure and energetics of the water monomer and dimer with the experimental values , and could originate in the neglect of quantum statistics for the many high - frequency vibrational modes in this system .",
