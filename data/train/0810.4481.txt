    "atomic physics and condensed matter physics now enjoy strong connections through the study of quantum transport in ultracold dilute gases @xcite .",
    "long - standing problems of condensed matter physics may be addressed by preparing controllable environments for the dynamics of cold atoms and by continuously tuning their interactions .",
    "this in turn allows for the study of fundamental features of high - temperature superconductivity using ultracold gases as controllable , analog computers of various model hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "degenerate fermi gases were first produced in 1999 @xcite , and more recently fermi superfluid behaviour has been conclusively evidenced through the generation of vortices @xcite and the onset of critical velocities @xcite in degenerate samples of @xmath0li .",
    "weakly interacting fermi gases are difficult to bring to quantum degeneracy mainly due to fundamental obstacles in adapting cooling techniques successfully used for bosonic species . in particular",
    ", the pauli principle inhibits efficient evaporative cooling among identical fermions as they reach degeneracy .",
    "this issue has been circumvented by developing two cooling techniques , namely mutual evaporative cooling of fermions prepared in two different states and sympathetic cooling with a bose species . in the case of dual evaporative cooling , a selective removal of the most energetic fermions in both the hyperfine states is performed .",
    "provided that the initial number of atoms in each state is roughly the same , efficient dual evaporative cooling can be performed throughout the entire process .",
    "limits to the minimum reachable absolute temperature using dual evaporative cooling have been addressed in @xcite , resulting in a minimum reachable temperature @xmath1 , with @xmath2 the chemical potential of the fermi gas ( see also @xcite for a complementary analysis ) . moreover , the number of available atoms @xmath3 progressively decreases over time with a corresponding drop in the fermi temperature @xmath4 proportional to @xmath5 .",
    "the resulting gain in terms of a lower @xmath6 degeneracy ratio is therefore limited , and the smaller clouds obtained at the end of the evaporative cooling are detrimental to detailed experimental investigations requiring a large number of atoms , such as a quantitative mapping of the superfluid phases . in the case of sympathetic cooling using a bose gas ,",
    "the number of fermions is instead kept constant , leaving aside losses due to background pressure and two- and three - body collisions , and the cooling efficiency depends on the optimization of fermi and bose collisional properties , heat capacities , and , in the case of inhomogeneous samples , their spatial overlap .    to date ,",
    "the smallest fermi degeneracy achieved with both cooling techniques is in the @xmath7 range @xcite .",
    "this limitation has not precluded the study of temperature - independent features of degenerate fermi gases , such as quantum phase transitions related to unbalanced spin populations @xcite or the effect of fermi impurities in the coherence properties of a bose gas @xcite .",
    "however , the study of more conventional phase transitions in which the temperature is the key parameter is still uncharted territory and , as discussed for instance in @xcite , this requires the achievement of degeneracy factors @xmath8 or lower .",
    "unconventional pairing mechanisms that are unstable at higher @xmath9 could then be observed , and the phase diagram of fermi atoms in the degenerate regime could be mapped in a wider range of parameter space .",
    "moreover , the study of ultracold fermi - bose mixtures is an interesting subject in itself , acting as the counterpart of the @xmath10he-@xmath11he liquid mixtures extensively investigated at much higher densities and temperatures .    considering the novel physical insights that deeper fermi degenerate gases and fermi - bose mixtures may provide ,",
    "it is relevant to discuss the limitations to reaching the lowest @xmath6 in realistic settings available by means of sympathetic cooling , and ways to overcome them . here",
    ", we discuss two different techniques to overcome the apparent @xmath12 limit observed so far , based on optimized heat capacity matching with species - selective traps or with lower dimensionality traps .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , after briefly reviewing previous results on sympathetic cooling in species - selective traps , we determine the time evolution of the temperature of the mixture in a particular class of species - selective traps through a thermodynamical analysis , and we subsequently include the effect of the spatial overlap between the thermal component of the bose gas and the fermi gas .",
    "the main novelty with respect to previous semiquantitative analyses is that including both temporal and spatial dependence in the thermodynamics of sympathetic cooling leads to an optimization of the heat capacity provided that a time - dependent trapping frequency ratio is implemented . as an alternative to this optimization procedure , in section iii",
    "we discuss heat capacity matching resulting from lower effective dimensions for trapping , exploiting the strong dependence on dimensionality of the density of states of the bose gas . a simpler protocol for optimizing heat capacity is available with nearly one - dimensional fermi - bose mixtures , which requires time modulation of the trapping strengths of the fermi and bose gases in the last cooling stage .",
    "broader considerations on generic trapping settings are then discussed in the conclusions .",
    "after discussing the evidence for a correlation between the degeneracy factor @xmath6 and the trapping frequency ratio between the fermi and the bose species , we review previous results on the use of species - selective traps and their limiting assumptions .",
    "we then relax these assumptions with a thermodynamical analysis also including the effect of the partial overlap between the fermi gas and the thermal component of the bose gas in the specific case of bichromatic traps .",
    "evaporative cooling has been instrumental in reaching bose degeneracy for dilute atomic gases .",
    "extensive analysis have already addressed the dynamics of evaporative cooling of a bose gas @xcite , using monte - carlo @xcite , mean - field analysis @xcite , and beyond @xcite , including also more detailed effects @xcite .",
    "these studies have been also extended to the case of separate bose and fermi clouds @xcite or fermi - bose mixtures using the quantum boltzmann equation @xcite or other semiclassical models @xcite .",
    "some generic features of the effectiveness in cooling fermions through a bose gas can be addressed based on the insights first discussed in @xcite and then analyzed in more detail in @xcite .",
    "the heat capacity of a degenerate fermi gas depends linearly on its temperature , being for a harmonically trapped gas equal to @xmath13 , while a harmonically trapped degenerate bose gas has a cubic dependence on temperature @xmath14 .",
    "the degeneracy parameter can be written in terms of the ratio of heat capacities : @xmath15 @xcite . by assuming that sympathetic cooling loses efficiency when the heat capacity of the bose gas matches exactly that of the fermi gas ( @xmath16 )",
    "we obtain a conservative limit on the attainable @xmath6 _ vs. _ @xmath17 space , depicted in fig . 1 by the upper line .",
    "in the hypothesis that some residual cooling occurs when @xmath18 , for instance with cooling stopping when @xmath19 , we obtain the lower line in fig .",
    "1 . realistically",
    ", we do expect that sympathetic cooling will be quenched when @xmath20 ,",
    "_ i.e. _ in the region delimited by the two lines . in fig .",
    "1 we also plot the minimum @xmath6 as obtained by the various running experiments with fermi - bose mixtures .",
    "although the number of explored fermi - bose mixtures is limited and the diverse technical solutions for trapping and cooling may provide alternative explanations @xcite , a correlation between the trapping frequency ratio @xmath17 and the minimum achieved @xmath6 seems corroborated by the actual results and invites more quantitative attention .     _ versus _ the trapping frequency ratio @xmath21 .",
    "lines indicate the theoretically predicted range of @xmath6 values based on a semiquantitative heat capacity matching argument as discussed in the text .",
    "the experimental data are taken from @xcite ( amsterdam ) , @xcite ( mit ) , @xcite ( florence ) , @xcite ( boulder ) , @xcite ( houston ) , @xcite ( paris ) , @xcite ( tubingen ) . ]",
    "further analysis provided insight into the cooling limitations in different trapping conditions and for different species combinations @xcite .",
    "it was found that significant gains in @xmath6 could be achieved for stronger relative fermi - bose confinements than the _ natural _ @xmath17 provided by the mass ratio between the two species . in @xcite the focus was on an equilibrium situation at nearly zero temperature , and to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the cooling process a dynamical framework is needed in which crucial finite temperature effects for the bose gas are taken into account . here",
    "we specialize the analysis of the thermodynamics as @xmath22li is sympathetically cooled by evaporating @xmath23rb in an optical dipole trap .",
    "this mixture , expected to optimize cooling efficiency @xcite , is currently used in various laboratories @xcite both for studies of fermi superfluidity and for the formation of ultracold molecules @xcite , taking advantage of the large electric dipole moment of li - rb molecules @xcite .    in all previous discussions of species - selective traps a static picture was assumed for the cooling of the fermi - bose mixture , relying on the analysis already available in the case of single - species trapping @xcite",
    ". a critical element of this cooling is to balance the thermalization and loss rates ; rapid trap modification allows for minimization of atom losses but is limited by the requirement that we go proceed slowly enough to keep the system at thermal equilibrium .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that thermodynamic equilibrium is maintained if the ratio between the potential depth and the atomic cloud temperature , given by @xmath24 , is kept constant .",
    "the time - dependence of the potential depth is then given by @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the initial potential depth , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , with @xmath29 and @xmath30 the initial elastic collision rate . with the time dependence of @xmath31 determined in this way",
    "we can obtain the other relevant quantities in the process ( number of particles , temperature , density , scattering rates ) resulting in scaling laws similar to eq .",
    "( [ eqn1 ] ) .",
    "a potential depth / temperature ratio of @xmath32=5 to 10 is considered to yield optimal efficiency in evaporative cooling @xcite .",
    "this approach can be applied to either the simple case of evaporative cooling of a single bose species , or the sympathetic cooling in a fermi - bose mixture . in both cases ,",
    "( [ eqn1 ] ) describes the potential depth of the bose species @xmath33 , with the implicit assumption that the presence of the fermions does not drastically affect the evaporation and cooling of the bosons .",
    "this is justified since all dual - species systems trap at least an order of magnitude more bosons than fermions , but this approximation may suffer towards the end of the cooling process when a majority of the bosons have been evaporated .    in the case of a bichromatic optical dipole trap , from @xmath34",
    "we determine the required power @xmath35 of the laser confining both species , and then for a targeted trapping strength ratio @xmath17 we can calculate the required power @xmath36 for the bose - deconfining laser , and finally determine the fermion potential depth @xmath37 . in this way we have independent control of the spatial size and potential depth for each of the two species , allowing us to either",
    "maintain a constant @xmath17 throughout cooling or adjust the relative trapping strengths during the process .",
    "the exact way in which the temperature is determined from the trapping parameters depends upon both the model and the proposed cooling strategy .",
    "( [ eqn1 ] ) merely identifies a limit to the cooling rate if thermodynamic equilibrium is to be maintained throughout the process , and assuming a constant ratio @xmath32 , as it was discussed in @xcite . in practice",
    ", these assumptions can be relaxed by using a more dynamical model based on energy balance , as we discuss in the next section .",
    "to move beyond the limiting assumptions in @xcite , we start our analysis by considering a dual - species system at thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the trap parameters are then suddenly changed in order to force some bosons to evaporate ; then one waits for a new thermodynamic equilibrium before applying another evaporation step , in analogy to the scheme discussed in @xcite .",
    "the step - by - step temperature reached in this way is determined by energy conservation for the fermi and bose gases @xcite .    for concreteness",
    ", we consider a species - selective trapping scheme as described in @xcite .",
    "a mixture of @xmath3 fermions and @xmath38 bosons is confined into a bichromatic optical dipole trap tailored by two lasers of wavelengths @xmath39 , @xmath40 and powers @xmath35 , @xmath36 . in order to obtain quasi analytic results",
    ", we will approximate the trap potential by a truncated harmonic potential properly reproducing the bottom curvature and the depth of the well .",
    "this approximation becomes exact for energies small with respect to the trap depth , a condition satisfied in the cases discussed below .",
    "the presence of the second laser allows one to make the trap parameters of the fermion species , namely the characteristic frequencies @xmath41 and the depth @xmath42 , different from the corresponding boson parameters , @xmath43 and @xmath34 . as a consequence",
    ", the ratio @xmath21 , for each species @xmath44 we define @xmath45 , can be varied from its mass - determined value for @xmath46 to an ideally arbitrary large value for @xmath47 approaching a positive critical value @xcite .",
    "the evaporation steps are carried out by decreasing the power @xmath35 of the reference laser while maintaining the ratio @xmath47 at a constant value . in this way , the trap depths @xmath34 , @xmath42 , which are proportional to @xmath35 , and the frequencies @xmath48 , @xmath49 ( proportional to @xmath50 ) , decrease while the ratio @xmath21 remains constant @xcite .    at the end of an evaporation step in which the power of the reference laser is changed from @xmath35 to @xmath51 and once thermodynamic equilibrium is reestablished , the temperature changes from @xmath52 to @xmath53 according to an energy balance equation of the form @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the number of bosons in the excited states at temperature @xmath52 that evaporate and @xmath56 ( with @xmath57 ) is the mean energy per evaporated boson @xcite . the quantities @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the energy changes of the trapped boson and fermion species , both at temperature @xmath52 .    by observing that due to a change of @xmath35 , all the quantities @xmath52 , @xmath48 , @xmath34 , @xmath49 , @xmath42 change and using for @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 the expressions provided by eqs .",

    "the numerator of the last fraction in eq .",

    "we stress that whereas the minimum @xmath6 depends very little on the details of the cooling , the number of atoms of both species and initial values of temperature and reference laser power , we observe a substantial decrease of the minimum achievable @xmath6 , by increasing the ratio @xmath21 .",

    "the sharp drop observed in @xmath6 before the singular point deserves some comments . at temperatures",

    "the divergence of the derivative @xmath115 predicted at the critical point is certainly unphysical : we expect that a long time is needed to re - equilibrate the system in a freezing step @xmath116 with @xmath117 large . in this case",
    ", dissipative phenomena should be taken into account by a more complicated model in which the singular point will be substituted by a minimum . however",
    ", this does not change the meaning of the lowest reachable @xmath6 which is the point where fermion and boson specific heats do match .    in fig .",
    "3 we plot the dependence of @xmath6 upon the number of bosons , normalized to the fermion number ( assumed to be constant during the evaporation process ) .",
    "it is manifest that deeper fermi degeneracy factors are obtained for higher trapping frequency ratios .",
    "this plot has to be compared to the one presented in fig . 2 of @xcite in which @xmath6 was shown versus a similar quantity ( in our notation @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the number of initial bosons prior to evaporation ) .",
    "while our analysis confirms that the initial decrease in @xmath6 is faster for lower @xmath21 ratios , thus suggesting more efficient cooling - if measured by the drop in @xmath6 per unit of boson removed in the evaporation process - we also notice that the evaporation process extends much further for larger @xmath21 and allows to reach deeper fermi degeneracy factors before stopping .",
    "therefore , if the goal of the cooling process is the achievement of the lowest @xmath6 degeneracy parameters rather than saving bosons during the evaporative process @xcite , the use of larger @xmath21 is beneficial , at variance with @xcite .",
    "the main issue in @xcite is that no temporal dependence for the trapping frequencies was assumed ( unlike in eqns .",

    "the discussion in @xcite also struggles with issues arising from more practical limitations , as commented in @xcite , in particular the fact that all the fermi - bose species available in practice will be affected by issues of spatial overlap in usual confining potentials , due to the smaller mass of the fermi species ( apart from the never considered @xmath120k-@xmath121na mixture ) . also , for @xmath122 the superfluid critical velocity of the bose gas will become larger than the fermi velocity , inhibiting scattering between fermions and bosons and then sympathetic cooling @xcite .",
    "finally , a weaker trapping frequency for the fermi species corresponds to a lower potential energy depth with respect to that of the bosons , resulting in significant fermion losses during the forced evaporative process of the bosons .",

    "there is a limit to @xmath136 for a given @xmath21 , however , since the cloud of less massive fermions will have a much larger spatial radius and thus a strong relative confinement is required to improve the fermion - bose condensate overlap .",
    "the overlap dependence on number ratio is rather straightforward , with a gradual decrease in fermion - condensate overlap as bosons are evaporated and an almost flat behaviour for @xmath137 since @xmath60 is roughly constant for a given temperature and boson losses manifest as a decrease in the condensate fraction and have minimal effect on the thermal cloud .    the effect of the spatial overlap on the minimum reachable fermi degeneracy factor @xmath6 is depicted in fig .",
    "5 , with the choice of interspecies scattering length of the li - rb system corresponding to the pessimistic scenario of repulsive interaction ( see @xcite for the issues related to its measurement ) .",
    "it is evident that about one order of magnitude may be lost in the achievable minimum degeneracy factor when the overlap factor is taken into account , although we conjecture that with a full kinetic analysis the actual result will be located in between the two curves .",

    "7 . this suggests the use of a time - variable trapping strategy , initial with lower values of @xmath21 , then increased in time by increasing the power ratio @xmath47 .",
    "such a time - dependent relative confinement strategy is not the only way to optimize the fermi degeneracy factor , however . in the following",
    ", we will discuss a similar procedure which exploits the advantages of reducing the dimensionality of the system when fermi degeneracy is approached .",
    "as an alternative to the cooling strategy described above , we discuss here the possibility to match the heat capacity of bose and fermi gases at the lowest possible @xmath6 by exploiting lower dimensionality traps . ultimately , the mismatching between the specific heats of bose and fermi degenerate gases depend on the scaling of the heat capacities with temperature , and this in turn depends upon the dimensionality of the bose gas . as discussed in @xcite and demonstrated in @xcite , a dramatic increase in the trapping frequency in one ( or two ) trapping axes will result in an effective two- ( or one- ) dimensional system .",
    "this in turn allows for a better matching of the heat capacities since the bose gas dependence on temperature will become milder than in the full 3d case .",

    "the number of particles for bosons ( @xmath140 ) and fermions ( @xmath139 ) is : @xmath156 the upper limit @xmath157 in the summation should be infinity in principle , but a value of @xmath157=1500 is sufficient for numerical convergence . for the given parameters @xmath138 and @xmath158 we solve the above two equations for @xmath2 at different temperatures , and then calculate the heat capacities . as depicted in fig .",
    "8 , the bose and fermi heat capacities intersect each other at @xmath159 , with the three - dimensional fermi temperature @xmath160 .",
    "the situation is very similar for atoms trapped in a 2d isotropic harmonic potential , except that now the energy eigenvalues are given by@xmath161 , with degeneracy @xmath162 , and @xmath157 needs to be increased to @xmath163 to achieve adequate convergence .",
    "the two heat capacities curves intersect each other at @xmath164 where the 2d fermi temperature @xmath67 is given by @xmath165 . from fig .",
    "8 we see that going from a full 3d to a 2d system actually slightly worsens the heat capacity matching , yielding a higher @xmath6 at the point where @xmath166 and @xmath167 intersect each other",
    ". however , further reduction to a 1d system results in complete matching of the heat capacities , as we will see below .     with equal mass @xmath168 .",

    "if we follow the same steps as the 2d and 3d cases , the upper summation limit @xmath157 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : n3d ] ) ) must be extremely large in order to reach convergence and approximations are required for the one - dimensional trap analysis .",
    "these approximations are outlined in appendix b and with them we obtain the fermi and bose energies , from which the heat capacities are evaluated . to take full advantage of the gain in the heat capacity matching in 1d traps",
    "it is helpful to investigate how heat capacities of bosons and fermions change when we gradually reduce the dimension of the trap .",
    "we assume that the atoms are first trapped in a 2d trap with trapping frequencies along the two dimensions @xmath158 and @xmath176 , and then this relative confinement parameter @xmath177 is gradually increased from 1 to infinity .",
    "the system will be effectively 1d when @xmath178 .",
    "we evaluate the heat capacities of bosons and fermions at different values of @xmath177 .",
    "the results are shown in fig . 9 ( a - d ) .",
    "as @xmath177 increases , the shape of the heat capacity curve of bosons becomes more similar to that of fermions , in the sense that it slowly loses the peak structure and the curvature near zero temperature begins to resemble that of fermions .",
    "if @xmath177 is further increased ( case ( c ) ) there will be a region where the two curves completely coincide with each other .",
    "this is consistent with the previous result we obtained for an ideal 1d trap . in fig .",
    "9 ( d ) the heat capacity curves of bosons and fermions are shown at an even higher aspect ratio , to emphasize the crossover from the 1 d case to the 2 d case at high temperatures . in the ideal 1d case ,",
    "the heat capacity curves are identical , as simply explained in the canonical ensemble approach @xcite .",
    "indeed , the total internal energy of fermions in a 1d harmonic trap only differs from that of the bosons by the fermi zero - point energy @xmath179 , and therefore the two systems have identical heat capacities .",
    "the existence of this crossover indicates that we can control the heat capacity matching of bosons and fermions by changing the ratio of the two trapping frequencies in a 2d trap .",
    "thus one possible solution to improve the cooling efficiency is to first evaporate in a 3d trap and then , when the fermi degeneracy starts to reach about @xmath180 , to increase the trapping frequencies achieving a quasi - one dimensional system , then continuing the evaporation process .",
    "a possible limitation of this technique comes from the larger collisional loss rate as a result of the increased confinement . also ,",
    "as studied for achieving bose condensation of hydrogen atoms , the nearly 1d character of the evaporative cooling @xcite may lead to non - ergodic evaporation limiting its efficiency @xcite , although this has not prevented achievement of bose degeneracy @xcite .",
    "we have examined the thermodynamics of evaporative and sympathetic cooling in a fermi - bose mixture , and identified possible ways to achieve a lower fermi degeneracy factor @xmath6 .",
    "thermodynamical considerations are based on general assumptions and measurable , phenomenological inputs , like heating rate and specific heat , and provide a solid framework to discuss cooling dynamics regardless of sophisticated microscopic models @xcite .",
    "they also allow for comparison with experimental results , such as those discussed in @xcite , or for the inclusion of more realistic inputs such as the specific heat of an interacting gas @xcite .",
    "although we have focused the attention on the particular @xmath0li-@xmath23rb mixture , the extension to other fermi - bose combinations is straightforward , furthermore benefiting from more favourable interspecies thermalization properties with respect to this particular mixture , for which limitations in elastic scattering and use of feshbach resonances have been experimentally evidenced @xcite .    among the main results we have obtained , we have discussed two different cooling strategies : constructing a species - selective trap with independently tunable fermi and bose trapping frequencies , and creating traps with reduced dimensionality in the latest stage of evaporation . we have shown that different trapping ratios lead to distinctly different cooling trajectories .",
    "however , incomplete spatial overlap will not only result in a longer cooling time needed to attain a given temperature , but will also increase the temperature at with the heating rate will balance the cooling rate . when the progressive depletion of the bosonic thermal cloud is taken into account ,",
    "optimized cooling requires time - dependent trapping strengths .",
    "additionally , we have discussed how to exploit the strong dependence of the bosonic specific heat upon dimensionality to create nearly one - dimensional traps in the ultimate stage of sympathetic cooling .",
    "this will be of particular relevance for various planned studies of fermi gases in optical lattices @xcite in which bichromatic optical traps are not viable .",
    "we report here the expressions for the energy and the number of particles of ideal degenerate bose and fermi gases confined a in a three - dimensional harmonic trap of finite depth .    for the trapped bosons we start with the exact expressions of the energy and of the number of particles in a general 3d harmonic potential : @xmath181 @xmath182 where @xmath183 .",
    "as usual , we write @xmath184 , where @xmath185 is the number of bosons in the ground state and @xmath60 the number of those thermally excited . in order that the number of particles remains positive , it is necessary for the chemical potential to satisfy @xmath186 . at temperatures @xmath187 , where @xmath107 is the bose - einstein condensation critical temperature , the chemical potential is frozen to its maximum value . in general , @xmath188 and all the other thermodynamic quantities",
    "can be evaluated explicitly as a power series expansion in the two parameters @xmath189 and @xmath190 , where @xmath191 @xcite . in the case @xmath192 and @xmath193 , which is relevant to the experimental situations discussed here , we can restrict to the lowest order and write @xmath194 @xmath195 where @xmath77 is the riemann zeta function .",
    "alternatively , the above two results can be obtained using the semiclassical density of states @xmath196 and the continuum approximation @xmath197 @xmath198 for a trap of finite depth schematized as a harmonic potential truncated at energy @xmath34 , we thus write @xmath199 @xmath200    consider now a system of @xmath3 fermions confined by a harmonic trap having characteristic frequencies @xmath41 . under the condition @xmath201 , a continuum approximation holds as in the boson case , so that the fermion counterparts of eqs .",

    "the accuracy of the continuum approximation introduced above is discussed in detail in @xcite .",
