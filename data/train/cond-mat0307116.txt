    "a self - similar system is called fractal @xcite and it is one of the subjects which attract attention broadly not only in natural science but also in social science , in recent years . in many cases , fractal structure appears in some restricted scale , does not do in all scale of the system concerned . for example , in the case of distribution of personal income interested in econophysics @xcite , the distribution of top several percent income earners follows fractal power law @xcite , while that of the rest earners does not do @xcite . in other words , in such a system , self - similarity is not maintained over all scale but is broken in small scale region .    in usual ,",
    "the fractal property and the deviation from it in each system are discussed by using individual models for the system .",
    "for example , as for the personal income distribution , the fractal power law in high income region is studied using a stochastic evolution equation @xcite .",
    "in addition , whole profile of the distribution is investigated based on a concept of small world network @xcite , and in @xcite , the distribution is explained using q - gaussian distribution emerged from nonextensive statistical mechanics @xcite . in this paper , however , we will discuss characteristics common to systems which show both fractal and non - fractal properties independent of the detail of the individual models .",
    "a scale invariant model does not have any scale , so we expect that distributions derived from the model follow power law .",
    "this is thought to be a universal property that does not depend on the detailed structure of the model .",
    "one of the simplest methods to realize both fractal and non - fractal scale regions analytically is to introduce a typical scale into a scale invariant model to break the original scale invariance .",
    "if the interaction term with a typical scale is added to the scale invariant model , the model obtains a typical scale and we expect that the distributions derived form the model become non - fractal in the scale region where the typical scale is meaningful , while keeping fractal property in the large scale region . in this paper",
    ", we will discuss fractal and deviation from it in the above framework .",
    "there are various ways to construct a scale invariant model . as a tool to discuss fractal property and deviation from it concretely , we take a model of 2-dimensional quantum gravity coupled with conformal matter fields . because of special nature of 2-dimension and the conformal property of the matter fields , the model has scale invariance and fractal property .",
    "some distributions derived from the model follow power law@xcite .",
    "one of the reasons to take this model is that the model is decided by the action only and it is suitable to treat the whole system analytically .",
    "in addition , the model has a simple geometrical meaning , so that it is easy to understand the fractal property and the deviation from it intuitively . ) . ]",
    "the above model , the standard 2d gravity model coupled with conformal matter fields , is scale invariant . to introduce a typical scale and",
    "break the original scale invariance , we add the @xmath0 interaction term to the action . here , @xmath0 is the square of scalar curvature .",
    "the obtained model * is * called @xmath0 2d gravity theory .",
    "because of the typical scale introduced , we expect the deviation from fractal in the scale region where the typical scale is meaningful@xcite , keeping the original fractal property in the large scale region .    in this paper",
    ", we would like to point out that the typical scale is a useful new concept to understand various distributions which have both fractal and non - fractal regions , employing the @xmath0 2d gravity model as a tool to understand the features of such distributions in a unified way . as examples of distributions which have fractal and non - fractal regions ,",
    "we take those of personal income and citation number of scientific papers .",
    "we show that these distributions are well understood by the typical scales and theoretical curves derived from the framework of the @xmath0 2d gravity model .",
    "we also point out that the @xmath0 2d gravity model also provides us with an effective tool to read the typical scales of various distributions in a systematic way .",
    "in this section , we review @xmath0 2d gravity model . first let us consider standard 2-dimensional quantum gravity coupled with conformal matter fields . to make the argument concrete , as conformal matter fields we take scalar fields @xmath1 .",
    "the action of the matter part takes the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the metric of 2d surface . in 2-dimension , the standard einstein action @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the scalar curvature , merely yields a constant which characterizes the topology of the 2d surface , so that we can neglect the einstein term .",
    "the total action is given by @xmath6 and it is invariant under the scale transformation of the metric @xmath7 .",
    "the partition function for fixed area @xmath8 of 2d surface is given by @xmath9 the action and the integration measure @xmath10 are invariant under 2d diffeomorphisms , so that the measure should be divided by the volume of the diffeomorphisms , which is denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "the partition function is evaluated to be @xmath12 @xcite , where @xmath13 is a constant determined by the central charge @xmath14 and the number of handles of the 2d surface @xmath15 , @xmath16 note that this model has no scale parameter , so that the partition function @xmath17 follows power law .",
    "it is expected that a typical 2d surface has self - similar structure ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2-dim random surface ] ) @xcite .      in order to investigate the breaking of fractal structure concretely , it is appropriate to treat 2d surface discretely . in study of 2d gravity ,",
    "one of the useful methods of discretizeing 2d surface is known as dynamical triangulation ( dt ) @xcite . in usual ,",
    "2d surface is discretized using small equilateral triangles , where each triangle has the same size . from various evidences ,",
    "dt is believed to be equivalent to the continuum theory of 2d gravity in the continuum limit @xcite .    in dt",
    ", the evaluation of the partition function is performed by replacing the path integral over the metric with the sum over possible triangulations of 2d surface . here",
    ", we represent the number of triangles sharing the vertex @xmath28 as @xmath29 , which is called a coordination number . in dt ,",
    "the @xmath0 term in the action ( [ action r2 ] ) is expressed by @xmath30 from the correspondence @xmath31 and @xmath32 . here",
    "@xmath33 is the area of a triangle and @xmath34 is the discretized local scalar curvature at the @xmath28-th vertex . from eq .",
    "( [ discretized r2 ] ) , we can recognize that the @xmath0 term has the effect to make 2d surface flat ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "this effect is parametrized by the coefficient of the @xmath0 term .",
    "in dt , fractal structure ( and non - fractal structure ) of 2d surface can be discussed by considering so - called minimum - neck baby universe ( minbu ) @xcite .",
    "a minbu is defined as a simply connected area region of 2d surface whose neck is composed of three links ( three sides of triangles ) , where the neck is closed and non - self intersecting . in general , a lot of minbus of various sizes are formed on a 2d surface . a typical dynamically triangulated surface is shown in fig .  [ fig:2-dim random surface ] .",
    "distribution of the area of minbu is one of the important observable quantities in dt .",
    "now let us evaluate the distribution of minbu .",
    "consider a closed 2d surface of area @xmath8 .",
    "there are many minbus on the surface , and each one is connected by a minimum neck one another .",
    "paying attention to one of the minimum necks , the whole surface can be divided into two minbus ( fig .",
    "[ fig : divided minbs ] ) , where one has area @xmath36 and the other has area @xmath37 . representing the partition functions of the two minbus as @xmath38 and @xmath39",
    "respectively , the statistical average number of finding a minbu of area @xmath37 on a closed surface of area @xmath8 , @xmath40 , can be expressed as @xmath41 here we set @xmath42 for simplicity , and @xmath17 denotes the partition function of a closed surface of area @xmath8 .      as for the case @xmath49 , the asymptotic form ( [ eq - n_a - hight ] ) follows power law , therefore , the surfaces are expected to be fractal .",
    "term @xcite , where no typical length scale exists . ] in this range , even if the model contains the @xmath0 term , at an area scale much larger than @xmath50 , the surfaces are fractal . on the other hand ,",
    "as for the case @xmath51 , the asymptotic form ( [ eq - n_a - low ] ) is highly suppressed by the exponential factor @xmath52 $ ] , hence , the fractal structure of 2d surface is broken . in this range , at an area scale much smaller than @xmath50 , the surfaces are affected by the typical length scale , and are not fractal . in the case of @xmath53 , the distribution ( [ eq - n_a - low ] ) is known as weibull distribution . in this paper , we call the distribution ( [ eq - n_a - low ] ) as weibull - like distribution .",
    "the analytic results ( [ eq - n_a - low ] ) and ( [ eq - n_a - hight ] ) can be confirmed in the simulation of dt for the simple case that 2d surface is sphere ( @xmath54 ) and there is no matter field on it ( @xmath55 ) @xcite .",
    "the simulation results are expressed in fig .",
    "[ fig : the simulation results of dt ] . here , we plot minbu distributions , @xmath40 versus @xmath56 with a log - log scale for @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , which are coefficients of the discretized @xmath0 term ( [ discretized r2 ] ) . )",
    ", we can replace @xmath37 with @xmath56 because of the range @xmath63 . ] in this simulation , the total number of triangles is 100,000 .",
    "these minbu distributions can be well explained by the asymptotic formulae ( [ eq - n_a - low ] ) and ( [ eq - n_a - hight ] ) with @xmath64 and @xmath65 , which are obtained from @xmath66 .",
    "we can read the typical scale @xmath22 for each case .",
    "for example , the data fittings for the cases of @xmath67 and @xmath68 are represented in figs .",
    "[ fig : beta=50 ] and [ fig : beta=100 ] , and we obtain @xmath69 and @xmath70 as the value of @xmath22 respectively . in each of these figures ,",
    "several data points for small minbus are apart from the line of weibull distribution ( [ eq - n_a - low ] ) .",
    "we consider that it is the finite lattice effect . in small @xmath37 region ,",
    "each of the corresponding minbus consists of a small number of triangles , so that it is not appropriate to treat the area of minbu @xmath37 as a continuous variable .",
    "we apply the distribution of minbu in 2d @xmath0 gravity to other distributions observed in the real world , and examine whether it can explain these distributions . here , we investigate distributions of personal income and citation number of scientific papers @xcite .",
    "these two kinds of distributions have fractal power law and non - fractal regions , so it is possible that the theoretical curves ( [ eq - n_a - low ] ) and ( [ eq - n_a - hight ] ) can explain them .",
    "first , let us consider the personal income distributions of japan in the years 1997 and 1998 @xcite .",
    "the distributions and data fittings are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:1997-japan ] and [ fig:1998-japan ] . here",
    ", we do not accumulate the data in this analysis .",
    "the horizontal axis indicates the income @xmath71 in units of thousand yen and the vertical axis indicates the number density of persons @xmath72 per a period of @xmath68 thousand yen .",
    "in this paper , we proposed the concept of a typical scale in order to understand distributions which have both fractal and non - fractal scale regions in a unified framework .",
    "the point was to introduce a typical scale into a scale invariant model to break the original scale invariance and to produce non - fractal feature in the small scale region .",
    "we employed the @xmath0 2d gravity model as a tool to understand such distributions through the typical scale .",
    "minbu distribution in this model followed the power law in the large scale region and provided weibull - like one in the small scale region .",
    "as examples of distributions where fractal and non - fractal regions coexist , we took those of personal income and citation number of scientific papers .",
    "we showed that these distributions were fitted fairly well by the theoretical curves of minbu distribution , adjusting the values of @xmath14 , @xmath15 and the typical scale . from these fittings , as for the personal income , we consider that there is no scale with respect to money for the top several percent high income earners , on the other hand , the rest earners are highly influenced by the typical scale of income",
    ". we can understand whole profile of the distribution merley by introducing the typical scale . as a result",
    ", we consider that the typical scale is a useful concept to understand various distributions where both fractal and non - fractal scale regions exist .",
    "we also consider that the @xmath0 2d gravity model provides us with an effective tool to read the typical scales of various distributions in a systematic way .",
    "in the distributions studied in this paper , the values of the typical scale are comparable with the average values of the distributions . we consider that the typical scale is a significant characteristic parameter similar to average in such distributions .",
    "the typical scale , however , can be read mainly from the data in the small scale region .",
    "it can thus be a more efficient characteristic parameter than average in some situations .",
    "we use the @xmath0 2d gravity model as a tool to discuss the significance of the typical scale concretely . besides the coincidence of the distributions , is there any direct physical connection between @xmath0 2d gravity and personal income or citation number ?",
    "we ca nt answer this question at present .",
    "however , 2d gravity can be also formulated by a stochastic evolution equation @xcite . as we mentioned in sect .  1 ,",
    "personal income distribution can be also described by a stochastic evolution equation @xcite .",
    "it may be possible to find the physical relation by investigating these formulations in detail .",
