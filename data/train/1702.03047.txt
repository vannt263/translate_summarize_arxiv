    "nowadays the study of the exotic hadrons is one of the hottest topics of hadron physics . within the quark model",
    "the ordinary mesons are considered as bound states of quark - antiquark pairs and baryons are three - quark bound states .",
    "however , more complicated states which include additional quarks and/or valence gluons are not forbidden by qcd .",
    "there were three big waves in the history of the exotic hadrons .",
    "the first wave was created by the pioneering papers by jaffe @xcite on spectroscopy of the four quark @xmath2 states within mit bag model with light @xmath3 quarks .",
    "these states we call now light tetraquarks .",
    "the second wave was created by the prediction of the @xmath4 strange pentaquark state with very small width within the chiral soliton model @xcite .",
    "the third and last wave was generated by the belle collaboration discovery of the @xmath5 meson with very small width and the mass near @xmath6 threshold @xcite .",
    "now we have many candidates for exotic tetraquark states with heavy quark content which are called the @xmath0 mesons .",
    "there are also several candidates for the heavy pentaquarks ( see , for example , the recent reviews @xcite ) .",
    "a lot of the different microscopical models have been suggested to explain their unusual properties .",
    "we discuss a new approach to the @xmath0 mesons based on the possibility of a large mixing between radial excitations in the light quark and antiquark system and states with heavy quark content .",
    "such mixing might be induced by the nonperturbative quark - gluon interaction related to the nontrivial topological structure of the qcd vacuum .",
    "the second part of this review is devoted to the modern status of glueballs which are the bound states of the gluons .",
    "we discuss the properties of these exotic hadrons including the possibility of the existence of the three - gluon bound states . and",
    "finally , we show that glueballs can influence strongly the properties of quark - gluon plasma .",
    "one of the main problems of the exotic hadron spectroscopy is the possibility of large mixings between exotic and nonexotic hadrons with the same quantum numbers .",
    "this mixing does not allow , in the most cases , to separate exotic states from the ordinary hadrons .",
    "the instantons , the strong fluctuations of the vacuum gluon fields , induce thooft s multiquark interaction which can lead to the strong mixing of the different quark flavors ( see review @xcite ) . due to the specific structure of thooft s interaction",
    "it can violate the ozi rule in the channels with the quantum numbers @xmath7 and @xmath8 as shown in fig.1a .",
    "since the instanton corresponds to a subbarrier transition between vacua with the different topological charge , the natural energy scale of this violation is related to the height of the potential barrier between these vacua .",
    "this height is given by the energy of the so - called sphaleron @xmath9 gev with @xmath10  fm being the average instanton size in the qcd vacuum @xcite .",
    "for higher mass excitations one can expect that the instanton - anti - instanton molecules give an important contribution to the mixing between states with different quark flavors .",
    "examples of such mixing between light quark - antiquark states and states with heavy quarks are shown in the figs.1b , c and fig.2 . the nonperturbative interaction which governs that mixing is the quark - gluon effective interaction induced by instantons @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the gluon field strength",
    ", @xmath13 is the effective mass of the light @xmath14 quarks in the vacuum and @xmath15 is the anomalous quark chromomagnetic moment ( aqcm ) .",
    "an extension of eq.[lag ] which preserves the chiral symmetry was suggested by polyakov and has the following form @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the pion decay constant . case . ] within the instanton model , the value of aqcm is @xcite @xmath18 for @xmath19 mev in mean field approximation .",
    "in general , a high radially excited state of a light quark - antiquark system can mix easily with states which have a heavy quark content , if they have the same quantum numbers and approximately the same mass .",
    "it might be that the @xmath5 and the @xmath20 are result of the mixing of molecular states and/or tetraquark charmed hidden states with high radial excitations of a light quark system , by the mechanism shown in fig.1b , c and fig.3b .",
    "a recent paper in the spirit of this idea was presented by coito @xcite . in the case of such mixing one",
    "should observe the decays of the xyz mesons to final states without heavy quarks .",
    "the absence of these decay modes in present experiments might be related to the existence of many nodes in the wave function of the light quark system .",
    "one can estimate , for example , that light quark @xmath21 systems with radial numbers @xmath22 have approximately the same mass as the @xmath5 and the @xmath20 .",
    "the many node structure of the wave function might lead to a very small overlap of the initial and final wave functions in the decay .",
    "these strong effect of the many nodes in wave function in decays is well known phenomenon .",
    "in particular , brodsky and karliner in @xcite used it to explain the small rate of @xmath23 in comparison with @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , the mixing of high excited states in light quark - antiquark systems with heavy quark states might be behind of the unusual properties of xyz mesons .",
    "there is a longstanding problem to explain the absence of transverse polarization of @xmath1 in the inclusive production at high energy .",
    "the transverse polarization was predicted by perturbative qcd and it comes from the fragmentation of on - shell gluon to charm - anticharm pair ( see review @xcite ) .",
    "such polarization is in disagreement with the measurement at tevatron @xcite and at lhc @xcite .    in a recent paper the polarization of gluons in the constituent quark induced by instantons",
    "was calculated @xcite .",
    "the diagram without pion , fig.4a , produces no polarization of the gluons @xcite .",
    "however , the diagram with an additional pion , fig.4b , leads to polarization of the gluons . in this case",
    "the instanton and anti - instanton provide a polarization of opposite sign .",
    "the contribution of the instantons to the @xmath1 polarization in proton - proton collisions is presented in fig.5 .",
    "it is evident , that such mechanism leads to a longitudinal polarization of the @xmath1 because the perturbative vertex with a hard gluon does not change the helicity of the charm quark .",
    "-0.5 cm    from the another side , one can consider this new mechanism as the contribution to the inclusive production of the quarkonia coming from the mixing of light quarks with a state having heavy quark content .",
    "the glueballs , the bound states of the gluons , are now widely under discussion ( see the reviews @xcite ) .",
    "different approaches including mit bag model , several types of the constituent models , holographic qcd , qcd sum rule methods and the lattice simulation were used to extract the information on the spectrum and quantum numbers of the glueballs .",
    "one direct way based on the first principals of qcd to calculate the glueball spectrum are lattice calculations . at the present , the old @xcite and more recent lattice calculations @xcite in quenched qcd , i.e. the theory without quarks",
    ", are in the agreement and the result for the low mass of the glueballs in pure @xmath25 is @xmath26 one of the interesting features of lattice calculations is that in the unquenched qcd with light quarks the result for the lowest mass of glueballs practically does not change @xcite @xmath27 for 2 + 1 flavor and @xmath28 mev .",
    "a more recent result for @xmath29 and @xmath30 mev is @xcite @xmath31 there are many candidates for the glueball states . for the scalar glueballs we have the following mesons @xmath32 for pseudoscalar glueball the candidates are @xmath33 in the case of the tensor glueballs there are two candidates @xmath34 one of the main problems of the glueball spectroscopy",
    "is the possible large mixings of the glueballs with ordinary and exotic quark states which leads to the difficulties in disentangling the glueballs in the experiments ( see recent discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "the example of such mixing is presented in fig.6 .",
    "the contribution of the mixing presented in fig.6a was considered in @xcite within the qcd sum rule method , and it was shown to be very important .",
    "one of the suitable ways to avoid this problem and obtain a clear prediction for the glueballs is to study the glueballs with exotic quantum numbers . @xmath35 which can not mix with ordinary quark - antiquark states .",
    "however , the calculation of the masses and decay modes of these exotic glueballs is very difficult because one should consider states with a large number of gluons .",
    "for example , lattice calculations give a very large mass @xmath36 gev with a large uncertainty for the @xmath37 exotic three - gluon glueball .",
    "the first attempt to calculate the masses of the glueballs with exotic quantum number was done in ref .",
    "@xcite within the qcd sum rule approach and a rather small mass for @xmath38 glueball was found .",
    "however in a recent paper @xcite , it was shown that the interpolation current for the gluonic state used in @xcite has an anomaly and can not be applied for the glueball calculations . in ref .",
    "@xcite a new interpolating current for the @xmath38 glueball has been suggested .",
    "the derived qcd sum rules are consistent and stable .",
    "the resulting value for the mass of the @xmath38 glueball state is @xmath39 gev and an upper limit for the total width @xmath40  mev has been obtained .",
    "it has been also argued that the mixing of this glueball state with @xmath38 tetraquark is expected to be very small .",
    "therefore , the exotic @xmath38 glueball can be considered a pure gluon state . at the present ,",
    "the belle collaboration is searching for this state @xcite .",
    "in experiments at rhic and lhc a new type of nuclear matter the so - called strongly interacted quark - gluon plasma has been discovered ( see review @xcite ) .",
    "it behaves as a liquid and does not have the expected gas - like behavior .",
    "there are many experiments planned at the running and future facilities to investigate the properties of such new matter .",
    "it is very important from the point of view of theory of the strong interactions to find the fundamental reason which leads to such behavior of quark - gluon matter .",
    "one possible way is to investigatethe simpler case of pure gluodynamics , the theory without quarks .",
    "recently very precise lattice results for the equation of state ( eos ) of this theory at finite @xmath41 below and above the deconfinement temperature @xmath42 were presented @xcite .",
    "they challenge our understanding of qcd dynamics at finite temperatures .",
    "one of the puzzles is a very spectacular behavior of the trace anomaly , @xmath43 , as a function of @xmath41 . in particular , just above",
    "@xmath42 it rapidly grows untill @xmath44 and then it decays as @xmath45 untill @xmath46 .",
    "a mechanism which can explain such anomalous behavior has been suggested in ref .",
    "the mechanism is based on the possibility of a large change of the glueball masses above the @xmath42 .",
    "the starting point is the relation between the lowest scalar glueball mass , @xmath47 , and the gluon condensate , @xmath48 at @xmath49 , which appears naturally in the dilaton approach @xcite @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the glueball coupling constant to gluons .",
    "lattice calculations show that the gluon condensate decreases roughly by a factor two at @xmath52 due to the strong suppression of its electric component , while slightly above @xmath42 the condensate vanishes very rapidly due to the cancellation between its magnetic and electric components @xcite .",
    "the temperature behavior of the condensate at @xmath53 can be described by the equation @xcite    @xmath54 \\nonumber\\ ] ]    and the mass of scalar and pseudoscalar glueballs for @xmath55 are given by @xmath56 the possible dynamical reason for the decrease of scalar and pseudoscalar glueball masses above @xmath42 is the strong attraction between gluons induced by instanton - antiinstanton molecules shown in fig.7 .",
    "such a molecular structure of the instanton vacuum is expected above @xmath42 for the quark - antiquark channel the effect of the instanton - antiinstanton induced interaction was discussed in @xcite and it was shown to be strong . for the gluon - gluon interaction the effect should be even stronger because it is enhanced by factor @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the instanton action .",
    "the rapid decrease of the scalar and preudoscalar glueball masses above @xmath42 leads to a large contribution of these glueballs to the pressure of the gluon plasma and the sum of the glueball and free gluon contributions describe the lattice data very well as shown in fig.8 .",
    "given these results we can describe three different phases of gluon matter @xcite .",
    "the first phase is the confinement regime at @xmath59 and is described by a gas of massive glueballs .",
    "the second phase appears just above @xmath42 at @xmath60 , where @xmath44 . in this phase",
    "the main contribution to the eos is coming from the very light scalar and pseudoscalar glueballs . above the @xmath61",
    "the third phase appears , a mixed phase of massless gluons and point - like scalar - pseudoscalar massless glueballs .",
    "the existence of such phases can be checked in high multiplicity events in relativistic heavy ion collisions where an abundant production of glueballs is expected @xcite . the most simple way is to look for the change of the scalar and pseudoscalar glueball masses in the two pion and three pion channels , correspondingly , as a function of multiplicity .",
    "finally it should be also mentioned that the mixing between quark and gluon states can change strongly above @xmath42 due to the transition between single instanton induced mixing to the mixing produced by instanton - antiinstanton molecules .",
    "the exotic hadrons carry a very important information on the structure of the strong interactions and the properties of the exotic hadrons are very sensitive to the nonperturbative structure of qcd .",
    "we have shown that the xyz mesons can arise as the result of a nonperturbative mixing between different configurations with and without heavy quark content .",
    "we have furthermore suggested a new mechanism for heavy quarkonia production at high energy which can be related to such mixing .",
    "we have also discussed the modern status of the glueballs and their mixing with quarkonia . finally , we have predicted a drastic change of the scalar and pseudoscalar glueball masses above the deconfinement temperature in the gluonic plasma which has very exciting consequences at the level of the possible phase transitions at very high temperatures .",
