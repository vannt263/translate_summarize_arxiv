    "collecting all the diagrams from the @xmath44 perturbed triples , we define @xmath178 there are in 54 many - body diagrams and these are separable into ten groups .",

    "the contributions from the @xmath31 perturbed triples , like in @xmath32 perturbed triples , is separated into two categories : perturbation to the core orbital and virtual orbital .",
    "contribution from these are defined as @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "similar to @xmath181 , diagrams from each of these are classified into groups . diagrams from each of the groups with direct at all the two body vertices are given in fig .",

    "in addition to the sources of errors discussed so far , the other sources of errors are the qed corrections .",
    "however , this can not be considered as the source of error of the many - body method .",
    "it is rather the form of interaction considered in the calculations .    to put an upper bound on the uncertainty in the hfs results , we select and add the largest change from each of the sources . which turn out approximately to be 0.2% , 0.3% , 0.4% and 1.5% for the states @xmath188 , @xmath189 , @xmath190 and @xmath191 , respectively . for the state @xmath192 , since there is large cancellations , a comprehensive analysis is necessary to arrive at a meaningful uncertainty estimate .",

    "the permuation properties are derived from the rules of angular momentum diagrams .",
    "although , we have discussed the triple cluster operator in the context of valence triples @xmath3 , the same definition applies to core triples @xmath193 .",
    "this may be explicitly demonstrated with a minor topological transformation of the cluster operator .",
    "based on the generalized tensor representation of @xmath3 , we derive the linearized rcc equation for ccsdt approximation .",
    "we have analysed the contributions from the triple excitation cluster operators to the hfs constants in detail . for the analysis we identify two groups of diagrams depending on the nature of contractions to generate the triple cluster operator . in most of the cases",
    "the lo and nlo are identified as @xmath194 and @xmath195 .",
    "these arise from the triples through the perturbation of @xmath31 cluster operators . from the results , for hfs constants computations with perturebed triple excitation cluster operators ,",
    "it is sufficient to approximate @xmath196 contributions from the remaining terms are negligible and can be excluded from the computations .",
    "the total number of diagrams considered in the present calculations are 108 .",
    "number of diagrams , however , will decrease significantly with geniune valence triple cluster operators @xmath3 as the separation into core perturbed and virtual perturbed cluster is not applicable .",
