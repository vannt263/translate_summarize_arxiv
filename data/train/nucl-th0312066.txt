    "the representation of the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) scattering matrix , within the context of an appropriate dynamical framework is crucial for the description of nuclear reactions and nuclear structure .",
    "recently , we demonstrated that a model based on the relativistic distorted wave impulse approximation ( dwia ) provides an almost perfect description of exclusive ( @xmath5 ) analyzing power data , whereas corresponding nonrelativistic schrdinger - equation - based predictions completely fail @xcite .",
    "for both dynamical models , however , the comparison of theoretical predictions to unpolarized cross section data yields similar spectroscopic factors which are also in good agreement with those extracted from ( @xmath6 ) studies .",
    "the above results highlight the important role that spin observables ( such as the analyzing power ) play , as opposed to unpolarized cross sections , in effectively discriminating between different dynamical effects and , at the same time , also pointing to the dirac equation as the preferred equation of motion .    however , before claiming the latter statement with absolute certainty , it is necessary to subject our relativistic dwia models to additional tests , such as comparing model predictions to additional spin observable data , other than the commonly measured analyzing power .",
    "in particular , it is important to eliminate obvious ambiguities associated with the choice of representation for the nn scattering matrix .",
    "essentially , the problem is related to the direct application of the free on - shell nn scattering matrix for the description of nucleons scattering from nuclei : the external nucleons partaking in free on - shell nn scattering are represented by free positive - energy dirac spinors , whereas for scattering from nuclei the scattering wave functions are linear combinations of both positive and negative- energy dirac spinors [ see sec .",
    "( [ sec : results ] ) ] . to date ,",
    "all applications of dirac relativity to describe exclusive ( @xmath7 ) reactions have adopted the so - called ia1 parametrization , whereby the free nn scattering matrix is parametrized in terms of five lorentz ( scalar , pseudoscalar , vector , axial - vector , and tensor ) invariants which are consistent with parity and time - reversal invariance as well as charge symmetry .",
    "these invariant amplitudes are obtained by fitting to free nn scattering data .",
    "there are , however , an infinite number of five - term representations with the same on - shell matrix elements for free nn scattering , and which also respect the above symmetries @xcite .",
    "hence , free on - shell nn scattering data can not distinguish between different five - term representations .",
    "however , for applications to nuclear reactions , different five - term representations result in drastically different observables , thereby clouding physical interpretation of the data . in refs .",
    "@xcite we demonstrated the limitations of the ia1 representation for applications to inclusive quasielastic proton - nucleus scattering : for example , one type of five - term representation describes ( @xmath8 ) data , whereas a different representation is required for ( @xmath9 ) scattering .",
    "the ambiguities associated with the ia1 representation can be eliminated by employing the more appropriate , but more complicated , ia2 representation developed by tjon and wallace @xcite , whereby the nn scattering matrix is expanded in terms of a complete set of 44 independent invariant amplitudes consistent with the above - mentioned symmetries .",
    "it follows therefore that ia1 neglects 39 additional amplitudes that should appear on the grounds of very general symmetry principles .",
    "the aim of this paper is to apply the ia2 representation , for the first time , to exclusive proton knockout reactions and to compare results to corresponding ia1 predictions of complete sets of spin observables .",
    "we have already studied the observable consequences of employing the ia2 , rather than the ia1 representation , for describing inclusive quasielastic proton - nucleus scattering @xcite .",
    "the aim of the latter paper was to identify spin observables which are sensitive enough to extract information regarding the modification of the properties of the strong nuclear force by nuclear matter .",
    "in particular , we demonstrated that the ia1 representation severely overestimates the importance of nuclear medium modifications on the nn interaction , whereas application of the ia2 representation suggests that quasielastic spin observables are insensitive to these effects .",
    "this emphasizes the critical role played by the representation of the nn scattering matrix in giving a correct interpretation of the results .",
    "although we have already demonstrated that a quantitative description of ( @xmath0 ) spin observable data requires the inclusion of nuclear medium effects on the scattering wave functions @xcite , in this paper we consider a relativistic plane wave approximation , thus neglecting the role of distorting optical potentials on the scattering wave functions .",
    "this simplification will allow us to uniquely focus on the effect of the different representations employed for @xmath10 .",
    "two kinematic conditions are considered , namely proton knockout from the @xmath1 state of @xmath2pb at an incident energy of 202  mev for coplanar scattering angles @xmath11 , as well as an incident energy of 392  mev for coplanar scattering angles @xmath12 .",

    "to conclude this section we comment on the difference between using ia1 ( solid line ) and ia2 , but including only subclass @xmath149 ( dotted line ) in figs .",
    "[ fig_2 ] and [ fig_4 ] . for 202 mev",
    "it is only @xmath150 and @xmath151 that display a significant difference between the two calculations . at 392 mev",
    "this difference is more pronounced and visible in all the spin observables .",
    "comparison of eqs .",
    "( [ eq_46 ] ) and ( [ eq_47 ] ) shows that @xmath152 where @xmath153 means the inclusion of only subclass @xmath149 and @xmath154 \\ ,    \\left [         \\alpha_{3 } u_{a } \\otimes v(\\frac{1}{2 } ) +         \\alpha_{4 } u_{a } \\otimes v(-\\frac{1}{2 } )   \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the only difference between these two calculations therefore lies in the coupling of positive to negative energy spinors .",
    "the quantity @xmath155 depends on the spin orientation of the incident and outgoing particles .",
    "however , since the spin observables are complicated combinations of @xmath54 it is very difficult to predict before - hand the degree of sensitivity to the difference between using ia1 and ia2 with only subclass @xmath149 .",
    "eventhough , we have shown in figs .  [ fig_3 ] and [ fig_5 ] that @xmath143 and @xmath144 are in general small compared to @xmath141 and @xmath142 , it follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq_50 ] ) that the amplitudes together with the matrix elements combine constructively to enhance the effect of @xmath155 to @xmath156 .",
    "expansion coefficients @xmath141 ( solid line ) , @xmath142 ( dashed line ) , @xmath143 ( dash - dotted line ) , and @xmath144 ( dotted line ) , of the @xmath145 [ top panel ] and @xmath147 [ bottom panel ] for proton knockout from the @xmath1 state in @xmath2pb , for an incident laboratory kinetic energy of 392  mev and coplanar scattering angles @xmath148 , in terms of free dirac plane waves [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq_31 ] ) ] . ]",
    "in this paper , we have studied the sensitivity of complete sets of exclusive ( @xmath0 ) polarization transfer observables to different lorentz invariant representations of the nn scattering matrix , namely an ambiguous five - term parametrization ( called the ia1 representation ) and an unambiguous and complete representation in terms of 44 invariant amplitudes ( referred to as the ia2 representation ) . to avoid complications associated with the distortion of the scattering wave functions by the nuclear medium",
    ", the scattering process is described within the framework of the relativistic plane wave impulse approximation , where the effect of the nuclear medium on the scattering wave functions is neglected .    for this particular study ,",
    "we have considered two kinematic conditions , namely proton knockout from the @xmath1 state of @xmath2pb at an incident energy of 202  mev for coplanar scattering angles @xmath11 , as well as an incident energy of 392  mev for coplanar scattering angles @xmath12 .",
    "it is seen that both ia1- and ia2-based predictions give virtually identical results for some spin observables at 202  mev , whereas most predictions at 392  mev clearly discriminate between both representations .",
    "the fact that even at the plane wave level , different representations predict different observables , suggests that one can also expect differences for the more realistic case where plane waves are replaced by distorted waves .",
    "consequently , since current relativistic distorted wave models are based on the ambiguous ia1 parametrization , one needs to re - interpret all exclusive ( @xmath0 ) data within the framework of the relativistic distorted wave impulse approximation based on the ia2 representation of the nn scattering matrix .",
