    ", a lot of progresses have been made in both the observational and theoretical aspects .",
    "the spectrum of prompt emission can often be fitted well by a broken power law , namely , the band function @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 spectrum generally peaks at @xmath4 mev .",
    "synchrotron is widely accepted as one of the most promising emission mechanisms @xcite . since the launch of _ fermi _ satellite , gev photons have been observed in the prompt emission of some grbs @xcite .",
    "an interesting feature is that gev photons often arrive seconds later relative to mev photons .",
    "if gev photons originate from synchrotron , the lorentz factor of the electrons should be very large and the magnetic field must be extremely strong , which are hardly realized in the astrophysical conditions .",
    "@xcite showed that the magnetic - dominated jet model can naturally explain the delayed arrival of high energy photons .",
    "according to this model , a jet dominated by poynting flux but contaminated by baryons , emits from the central engine with a large lorentz factor @xmath5 .",
    "mev photons are produced by synchrotron of electrons , while gev photons are produced by neutron - proton collisions or compton scattering process .",
    "the optical depth of gev photons is larger than that of mev photons .",
    "thus , gev photons emit at a larger radius where the optical depth becomes small enough .",
    "the time delay between high and low energy photons gives the constraint on jet lorentz factor @xmath5 . for long grbs @xmath6 , and for short",
    "grbs it is much larger @xcite .",
    "the magnetic - dominated jet model can produce a various type of spectra @xcite .",
    "besides the spectra , polarization measurement of photons provides another direct insight into the nature of grbs . in spite of many controversies exist , polarization has been observed in the prompt or afterglow phase of some grbs ( for example , see table 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite reported a polarization of @xmath7 in the prompt phase of grb 021606 .",
    "@xcite re - checked the data but no significant evidence for polarization was found .",
    "@xcite used a novel method to re - analyze the data and found a linear polarization of @xmath8 , which shows that the data is too poor to make a convincing conclusion .",
    "@xcite analyzed the data of the prompt emission of grb 041219a in the energy band @xmath9 kev , and found a linear polarization @xmath10 , although the instrumental systematics can not be ruled out .",
    "@xcite investigated the same grb in three different energy bands , and found that the polarization tends to decrease as the energy increases .",
    "@xcite re - examined the data and found a variable degree of polarization ranging from less than @xmath11 over the first peak to @xmath12 for the whole second peak .",
    "similar debates occur in the afterglow phase",
    ". however , the polarization in the grb afterglow phase seems to be smaller than that in the prompt phase .",
    "the polarization of grb afterglow is generally less than @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "many theoretical works have been devoted to studying the polarization of grbs .",
    "it is well known that the maximum polarization of synchrotron is @xmath14 , if the electrons are isotropic with a power - law index @xmath15 and the magnetic field is uniform globally @xcite . for a typical value of @xmath16",
    ", one has @xmath17 .",
    "if the magnetic field contains @xmath18 uniform patches , the net polarization is about @xmath19 @xcite",
    ". a randomly oriented magnetic field may also produce significant polarization if the line - of - sight is close to the jet edge @xcite .",
    "however , this occurs by chance only if the jet opening angle is very small .",
    "@xcite investigated the compton drag model and showed that the net polarization can be large if certain geometrical conditions are realized .",
    "@xcite performed the monte carlo simulation to calculate the grb polarization in three different models : the synchrotron model with a globally ordered magnetic field , the synchrotron model with a small - scale random magnetic field , and the compton drag model .",
    "they found that the compton drag model is favored if the polarization is larger than @xmath20 .",
    "@xcite investigated the polarization properties of photospheric emission originating from highly relativistic jet , and found that the polarization degree can reach @xmath21 in particular situation .",
    "@xcite studied the jitter radiation and concluded that high degree of polarization can be achieved .",
    "it was also showed that photons scattered off highly relativistic , baryon - rich materials can produce significant polarization @xcite .    in a very recent paper , @xcite presented an analytical formalism for the polarization of beamed photons scattered by isotropic electrons",
    ". the polarization of incident photons can be any value and the energy of incident electrons can be any distribution .",
    "it was showed that the photon - electron scattering may produce significant polarization even when the electrons have an isotropic momentum distribution , regardless that the electrons have thermal or nonthermal ( such as power - law distribution ) energy spectra .",
    "however , the formulae in that paper were given in the jet comoving frame .",
    "in addition , the polarization was expressed as a function of incident photon energy , which is not an observable quantity . in this paper",
    ", we try to transform the formulae into the observer frame .",
    "furthermore , the polarization is expressed as a function of the energy of scattered photon , which can be detected directly .",
    "this makes the formulae more convenient to be used in astrophysical processes .",
    "the rest of the paper is arranged as follows . in section [ sec : general - formulae ] , we introduce the kinematics of the general compton scattering process , obtain the formulae of stokes parameters for scattered photons , and derive final polarization analytically as a function of photon energy and viewing angle . in section [ sec : result ] , we carry out numerical calculations of polarization in four special cases : ( 1 ) electrons at rest , ( 2 ) thomson limit , ( 3 ) head - on collision , ( 4 ) monochromatic electrons . although these four cases may be far away from the actual astrophysical processes , they show the main properties of photon polarization via compton scattering process . in section [ sec",
    ": grb - cases ] , we test the validity of these formulae in explaining the observational data on two specific grbs , i.e. , grb 041219a and grb 100826a .",
    "finally , discussions and conclusions are given in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the general process of compton scattering is depicted in fig.[fig : geo ] .",
    "consider a photon with energy @xmath22 moves along the @xmath23-axis , then collides with an electron at point @xmath24 .",
    "after scattering , the photon goes towards @xmath25 direction .",
    "define a cartesian coordinate system such that the @xmath26-axis is in the scattering plane ( the plane which contains @xmath27 and @xmath25 ) , and the @xmath28 axes form a right - handed set .",
    "the injected electron has an arbitrary momentum @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the lorentz factor of the electron , @xmath31 is its velocity in unit of light speed , and @xmath32 is the moving direction of the incident electron .",
    "the parameter space of the incident electron can be completely represented by coordinates ( @xmath33 , where @xmath34 $ ] and @xmath35 $ ] are the polar and azimuthal angles of the injected electron , respectively .    the energy of scattered photon can be deduced from the conservation of energy and momentum .",
    "it reads @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 . from the geometrical considerations , we have @xmath40 one",
    "can also obtain the lorentz factor and moving direction of the scattered electron .",
    "however , we are only interested in the scattered photon , the scattered electron is ignored here .",
    "the polarization of a photon can be conveniently described by stokes parameters @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) @xcite .",
    "they are real numbers and are defined with respect to the @xmath28 axes .",
    "the positive ( negative ) @xmath43 describes photon linearly polarized along the @xmath44 ( @xmath26 ) axis .",
    "the parameter @xmath45 means the linear polarization along the directions with azimuthal angles @xmath46 relative to the @xmath44-axis in the @xmath47 plane .",
    "the parameter @xmath48 represents left - handed or right - handed circular polarization . in terms of stokes parameters , the degree of polarization can be written as @xmath49 the stokes parameters satisfy the condition @xmath50 . if @xmath51 , the photon is unpolarized . if @xmath52 , the photon is completely polarized . in the @xmath53 case ,",
    "we call that the photon is partially polarized .    in this paper , we are only interested in linear polarization .",
    "the circular polarization is generally very small , especially in afterglow phase @xcite . for simplicity ,",
    "we ignore the circular polarization and set @xmath54 in the following discussions .",
    "the polarization direction of a photon can be denoted by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the angle between the polarization direction and the @xmath44-axis . if @xmath57 , i.e. , @xmath58 or @xmath59 , the polarization is along the @xmath44-axis or @xmath26-axis , respectively . on the other hand , if @xmath60 , i.e. , @xmath61 , the polarization is along the directions with azimuthal angles @xmath46 relative to the @xmath44-axis in the @xmath47 plane .",

    "it should be noted that @xmath68 are defined in a new coordinate system @xmath69 , whose @xmath70-axis is parallel to the @xmath44-axis , @xmath71 axis is along the direction @xmath25 , and @xmath72 . in other words , the @xmath69 system is the @xmath73 system rotating an angle @xmath74 relative to the @xmath44-axis .",
    "this makes sure that the polarization direction of the scattered photon is still perpendicular to its wave vector .",
    "the stokes parameters of the secondary photon are denoted by @xmath75 , which are equal to the ratios of the coefficients of @xmath68 to the terms independent of @xmath68 @xcite , i.e. , @xmath76 note that the circular polarization of the secondary photon occurs only if the incident photon is circularly polarized .",
    "the degree of polarization of the scattered photon is @xmath77 the polarization direction of the scattered photon can be expressed as @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the angle between the polarization direction and the @xmath70-axis .",
    "we consider that the incident photon beam is of synchrotron origin .",
    "suppose that the magnetic field is globally uniform , the electrons are isotropic with a power - law distribution , i.e. , @xmath80",
    ". then the synchrotron photons are linearly polarized , and the polarization degree is @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "the stokes parameters of the synchrotron photons can be written as @xmath82 after being scattered by electrons , the stokes parameters change according to eq.([eq : pol ] ) , and the polarization direction changes according to eq.([eq : direction ] ) .",
    "we aim to obtain the polarization when a beam of synchrotron photons are scattered by isotropic electrons with a power - law distribution . after averaging over the energy and angles of the incident electrons , we obtain the averaged cross section as @xmath83,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the lower and upper boundary of the lorentz factors of the incident electrons , respectively .",
    "@xmath86 is the normalization factor .",
    "the scattered photons have an axial symmetry relative to the @xmath23-axis , so that @xmath87 is independent of the azimuthal angle @xmath88 .",
    "the definitions of the averaged components @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) are similar to that of the averaged cross section , i.e. , @xmath91 here the @xmath92 term is included , because the stokes parameters are the ratio of intensities , which are proportional to the cross section .",
    "the final stokes parameters can be obtained by replacing the components @xmath93 in eq.([eq : pol ] ) with the averaged components @xmath89 .",
    "it is difficult to give an analytical expression of these components .",
    "numerical method is applied to estimate the final polarization . after integrating over the parameter space of the incident electrons ( @xmath30 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 )",
    ", one can obtain the degree of polarization @xmath96 as a function of the viewing angle @xmath74 and the incident photon energy @xmath22 . in the cases of static electrons , power - law electrons and thermal electrons ,",
    "the results are already given in the paper of @xcite .",
    "it was showed that the scattered photons can be completely polarized if the electrons are at rest .",
    "significant polarization can still be realized even if the electrons are isotropic , regardless that the electrons have thermal or non - thermal energy spectra .",
    "all of the formulae above are only valid in the jet frame . in order to make them convenient to be used",
    ", we should convert the quantities into the observer frame . on the other hand ,",
    "the polarization as a function of the incident photon energy @xmath22 , should be converted to that of the scattered photon energy @xmath97 . to do this , note that the scattering angle between the two frames are related by @xcite @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the velocity of the jet moving towards the observer , and @xmath5 is the lorentz factor of the jet . here and after",
    ", symbols with a bar denote the quantities in the observer frame . from eq.([eq : angle - transform ] ) , we can see that , for @xmath74 not around @xmath100 , @xmath101 always approximates to zero .",
    "this means that isotropic electrons in the jet frame seem to be collimated along the line of jet direction in the observer frame .",
    "besides , eq.([eq : epspr ] ) can be equivalently converted to the form @xmath102 where the energy of the scattered photon in the jet frame can be doppler - shifted to that in the observer frame @xmath103 substituting eqs.([eq : angle - transform])([eq : doppler - shift ] ) into eq.([eq : energy - convert ] ) , one obtains @xmath104    note that the energies of both the incident and scattered photons are positive .",
    "thus , the denominator of the right - hand - side of eq.([eq : energy - convert2 ] ) should be positive .",
    "this gives a constraint on the parameter space of electrons , i.e. , @xmath105 here , we have used the approximation that @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "the meaning of this constraint is that , for a given scattered photon with energy @xmath108 and observed at angle @xmath101 , the electrons which contribute to the scattering process must satisfy eq.([eq : physical - range ] ) . in other words ,",
    "the electrons out of the constraint can not scatter a photon , regardless of its initial energy , to angle @xmath101 and energy @xmath108 .",
    "substituting eqs.([eq : angle - transform])([eq : energy - convert2 ] ) into eqs.([eq : fs])([eq : xy ] ) , and integrating over the parameter space of the incident electrons ( constrained by eq.([eq : physical - range ] ) ) , we can obtain the averaged components @xmath89 .",
    "substituting @xmath89 into eq.([eq : pol ] ) , the stokes parameters of the final photon can be derived .",
    "the numerical calculation in the most general case is time consuming . in this section",
    ", we will consider four special cases : ( 1 ) electrons are at rest in the jet frame , ( 2 ) thomson limit @xmath109 , ( 3 ) head - on collisions between beamed photons and beamed electrons , ( 4 ) electrons are monochromatic and isotropic .",
    "although these four cases may be far away from the actual astrophysical processes , they can show the main properties of photon polarization via compton scattering process .",
    "firstly , we investigate the most simple case , in which the incident electrons are at rest in the jet frame .",
    "such a system has already been studied in detail @xcite .",
    "we will show that it is a special case of the setup of the present paper .",
    "since electrons are static , one has @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "for an initially linearly polarized photon , whose stokes parameters are given in eq.([eq : xi0 ] ) , the final stokes parameters after scattering are reduced to @xmath112 where @xmath74 is related to @xmath101 through eq.([eq : angle - transform ] ) , and @xmath113 is derived from eq.([eq : energy - convert2 ] ) by setting @xmath111 and @xmath110 , i.e. , @xmath114 the photon observed at angle @xmath101 has an energy cutoff @xmath115 . when the polarization direction of the incident photon is parallel to the scattering plane , i.e. , @xmath116 , we have @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "this agrees with the result given by @xcite .",
    "as was pointed out , an interesting feature of the polarization in such a setup is that the direction of polarization may change @xmath119 after the scattering process .",
    "if the incident photon is unpolarized and its energy is low enough such that the thomson limit is valid , i.e. , @xmath51 and @xmath120 , eq.([eq : popost ] ) reduces to the famous result @xmath121 .",
    "the positive @xmath43 means that the polarization direction of the scattered photon is always perpendicular to the scattering plane .",
    "we plot the polarization as a function of photon energy @xmath108 and viewing angle @xmath101 in fig.[fig : electron - at - rest ] .",
    "the upper two panels depict that the incident photons have an initial polarization @xmath122 , while the lower two panels depict that the incident photons are completely unpolarized .",
    "the dot ( if there has ) on the end of each curve stands the energy cutoff .",
    "we set @xmath116 in the numerical calculation .",
    "the lorentz factor of the jet is taken to be @xmath123 , the typical value of long grbs @xcite .",
    "the positive and negative values of @xmath96 stand for the polarization parallel and perpendicular to the scattering plane , respectively . from fig.[fig : electron - at - rest ] , we can see that high polarization can be achieved even if the incident photons are unpolarized .",
    "high energy photons have small polarization than low energy photons . the low energy photons can be completely polarized at @xmath124 . at a fixed viewing angle , photons with energy @xmath125 mev",
    "almost have the same polarization .",
    "the most interesting feature is that , for the initially polarized photons , the polarization direction can change @xmath119 after scattering at certain viewing angles .",
    "note that the change of polarization angle occurs only if the incident photon is polarized . in the initially unpolarized case",
    ", we can see from panel ( c ) of fig.[fig : electron - at - rest ] that @xmath96 is always negative ( equivalently , @xmath126 is always positive ) .",
    "thus , the polarization direction of scattered photon is always perpendicular to the scattering plane .",
    "this is a well - known result of thomson scattering .",
    "if the incident photon is partially polarized , see panel ( a ) of fig.[fig : electron - at - rest ] for example , the sign of @xmath126 can be changed from negative to positive ( equivalently , the sign of @xmath96 changed from positive to negative ) at @xmath127 .",
    "thus , as the viewing angle increases , the @xmath119 change of polarization angle can be observed .    for photons with low energy @xmath125 mev , the polarization reaches its maximum @xmath128 at the viewing angle @xmath124 .",
    "this can been easily understood .",
    "it is well known that in the thomson limit , the polarization of an initially unpolarized photon scattered by an electron at rest is @xmath129 @xcite .",
    "the scattered photon is completely polarized at @xmath130 .",
    "when transform the angle to the observer frame , we have @xmath131 .",
    "this is because that , from eq.([eq : angle - transform ] ) , we get @xmath132 . here",
    "we have assumed that @xmath106 .",
    "the photon polarization via compton scattering process has been well studied in the thomson limit @xcite . when the energy of the incident photon is much smaller than the rest mass energy of electron , i.e. , @xmath109",
    ", the thomson limit is valid . in this case",
    ", the formulae in section [ sec : general - formulae ] can be highly simplified .",
    "eq.([eq : epspr ] ) reduces to @xmath133 then from eqs.([eq : ab])([eq : xy ] ) , we can see that @xmath134 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",

    "unpolarized photons are still unpolarized after scattering .",

    "the lorentz factor of the electrons is taken to be in the range @xmath144 $ ] .",
    "electrons with lorentz factor larger than 10 almost have no contribution to the polarization @xcite .",

    "an independent analysis of the same burst shows that the polarization is reduced if high energy photons are included @xcite .",

    "the polarization effect provides a perfect tool to distinguish the radiation mechanisms of astrophysical processes such as grbs .",
    "grb 100826a is one of the top @xmath194 brightest bursts listed in the _ batse _ catalog .",
    "it was detected by _ ikaros - gap _ at 22:57:20.8 ut on august 26th 2010 .",
    "the spectrum of grb 100826a can be well fitted by the band function , with the spectrum indexes @xmath195 , @xmath196 , and @xmath3 peak energy @xmath197 kev @xcite .",
    "@xcite analyzed the data of the prompt emission of duration 100 seconds , and found a change of polarization angle with @xmath198 confidence level , and the average polarization degree is @xmath199 with @xmath200 confidence level .",
    "they divided the total duration ( 100 s ) into two time intervals , labeled interval-1 ( 47 s ) and interval-2 ( 53 s ) , respectively .",
    "the polarization degree and polarization angle during these two intervals are @xmath201 , @xmath202 and @xmath203 , @xmath204 , respectively .",
    "there is high probability that the polarization changes @xmath205 between the two time intervals .",
    "@xcite pointed out that it is difficult to explain the observed significant change of polarization angle within the framework of axisymmetric jet .",
    "this phenomenon can be explained naturally by the synchrotron plus compton scattering model considered in this paper . during the first interval , the viewing angle @xmath101 is much smaller than the jet opening angle @xmath206 , and the polarization is positive , which means that the polarization direction is parallel to the scattering plane . as time goes on , the jet spreads transversely , and the line - of - sight moves away from the jet axis . at a certain angle ,",
    "the polarization changes from positive to negative , and the polarization direction becomes perpendicular to the scattering plane .",
    "in this paper , we obtained the analytical formulae for the polarization of beamed photons scattered by isotropic electrons with a power - law distribution with other distributions .",
    "we just take the power - law distribution as an example in the numerical calculation . ] .",
    "the incident photons are assumed to originate from synchrotron radiation , with any initial polarization degree @xmath207 and polarization angle @xmath56 . after being scattered by electrons , both the polarization degree and polarization angle",
    "are changed .",
    "the polarization of the scattered photons is a function of photon energy @xmath108 and viewing angle @xmath101 . in four special cases , we carried out numerical calculations .",
    "although these four special cases may be far away from the actual astrophysical processes , they show the main features of photon polarization via compton scattering process :    * the compton process can produce a wide range of polarization , from completely unpolarized to completely polarized .",
    "* at a fixed viewing angle , the polarization of high energy photons is smaller than that of the low energy photons . *",
    "the polarization effect mainly comes from the cold electrons .",
    "electrons with lorentz factor larger than 10 almost have no contribution to polarization . * in the electron rest case , low energy photons can be completely polarized at the viewing angle @xmath127 , while high energy photons can not be completely polarized . *",
    "the polarization direction may be changed after scattering . in a special setup",
    ", the polarization direction can be changed @xmath119 exactly . * due to the isotropic distribution of the electrons , the polarization is highly suppressed , but a maximum value of @xmath208 can still be achieved . *",
    "if the electrons are isotropic and monochromatic , the polarization of the scattered photons has a peak at @xmath178 mev .",
    "* in the thomson limit , i.e. , @xmath209 , the polarization is independent of photon energy , and a beam of unpolarized photons are still unpolarized after scattering .",
    "the polarization properties of compton scattering process are very different from that of other radiation mechanisms , such as synchrotron radiation and thermal radiation .",
    "the polarization measurement provides an excellent tool to distinguish different radiation mechanisms and jet structures .",
    "the observation of grb 041219a shows that the polarization tends to decrease as the photon energy increases .",
    "this is consistent with the prediction of the compton scattering process .",
    "the high and energy - dependent polarization of grb 041219a implies that it is not likely to be of synchrotron origin .",
    "the maximum polarization of synchrotron radiation is @xmath210 . if the magnetic field is nonuniform , the polarization is much smaller .",
    "furthermore , the compton process can naturally explain the @xmath119 change of polarization angle observed in grb 100826a , which is a challenge to most other models .",
    "@xcite argued that the jet should be non - axisymmetric in order to have a significant change of polarization angle .",
    "however , they can not explain why the polarization angle changes @xmath119 exactly .",
    "although polarization has been observed in many grbs , the observational energy band is usually limited to be below 1 mev .",
    "the polarization measurement in high energy band is still lacking . besides",
    ", the observation is often limited in a narrow energy band .",
    "observing the polarization in different energy bands is desirable .",
    "grb 100826a , to our knowledge , is among the few bursts which have a significant change of polarization angle .",
    "a more detailed analysis of grb 041219a in different time intervals shows that the polarization degree and polarization angle change dramatically with time @xcite .",
    "the time - averaged value over longer intervals shows reduced polarization .",
    "the variation of jet lorentz factor may lead to the variation of polarization . according to the calculation in the above sections ,",
    "the change of polarization angle is common in compton scattering process .",
    "the future measurement of polarization in energy bands higher than 1 mev and the change of polarization angles may provide us deeper insight into the radiation mechanism and the structure of emission region .",
    "the geometry considered in this paper is over - simplified .",
    "we have assumed that the photons are scattered only once by electrons .",
    "the actual process is much more complex . in the optically thick region ,",
    "multiple scattering occurs .",
    "after one scattering process , a photon changes its polarization as well as momentum and energy , and beamed photons become unbeamed .",
    "for such a multi - scattering system , it is very difficult to give analytical formulae to calculate polarization . since for unbeamed photons",
    ", there does not exist a coordinate system which is suitable to describe the stokes parameters for all the photons .",
    "the numerical simulation is useful to calculate polarization in such a complex system .",
    "in fact , monte carlo simulation has already been used to calculate polarization in the multi - scattering case @xcite .",
    "the formulae in this paper are easy to be used in monte carlo simulation , since they are expressed in the observer frame and can avoid lorentz transformation between different frames . on the other hand ,",
    "if the energy of photon is larger than the rest mass energy of electron , the @xmath211 annihilation may also take place .",
    "this process may significantly affect the polarization .",
