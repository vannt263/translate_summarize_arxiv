    "<S> we wish , therefore , to make a few contributions to the discussion of amsb , and in particular regarding the @xmath0-term solution of the tachyonic slepton problem due to an extra @xmath1 symmetry in the theory . </S>",
    "<S> our considerations have led us to a general `` ancillary @xmath3 '' , to be defined below , which nicely parametrizes some of the previous studies in this direction , and enables us to make quick work of some interesting theorems regarding the superpartner spectrum .    </S>",

    "<S> application of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ scalarmasses ] ) to sleptons shows that their mass - squared is negative . </S>",
    "<S> many groups have proposed ideas to solve this tachyonic slepton problem  @xcite,@xcite-@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> some solutions lose the uv insensitive feature of amsb , and some solutions preserve it . </S>",
    "<S> we wish to keep uv insensitivity , and retain gauge coupling unification , which is one of the more powerful hints that supersymmetry is a necessary element of the full theory of nature . </S>",
    "<S> the combination of these requirements leads us to consider low - scale @xmath0-terms from broken exotic gauge symmetries .    </S>",
    "<S> there are many considerations in employing @xmath0-term slepton solutions . </S>",
    "<S> this list includes the origin of the @xmath0-term vev , the crossing of thresholds , the charge assignments of the @xmath1 symmetry , proper electroweak symmetry breaking , gauge kinetic mixing with hypercharge , and gauge boson mass mixing . </S>",
    "<S> some of these issues can only be answered with detailed model building . </S>",
    "<S> our purposes here are to prove results on the superpartner spectrum that will be true for all models subject to only a few basic axioms .    </S>",
    "<S> our basic hypotheses are that the only low - scale fields that feel sm charges are the mssm fields . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the sleptons obtain positive mass - squareds via @xmath0-terms of an ancillary abelian symmetry , which is defined to be a local @xmath1 symmetry that is anomaly free but whose charges do not alter standard gauge coupling unification . </S>",

    "<S> [ mattercharges ] we do not address here the precise charges of the exotic sm singlet states @xmath20 , except to note that their @xmath3 charges must satisfy s_i = -3(6q+r )   and   s_i^3= -3(6q+r)^3 . although large yukawa couplings are generically necessary to break the @xmath3 , renormalizable operators do not couple the mssm matter and the sm singlets charged under the @xmath3 </S>",

    "<S> the effect of this contribution is to drive the sleptons more negative in squared mass in the infrared .    </S>",
    "<S> we can immediately construct a few theorems about the spectrum that arise from the ansatz of ancillary @xmath1 symmetry . since contributions must be positive for @xmath28 , we know that @xmath17 is necessary . therefore , by mere inspection of eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dtermmasses])-([deltagamma ] ) , we determine that additional d - term mass contributions to the squarks are always of well - defined sign : @xmath29    in the event that @xmath1 breaking is at a low scale and @xmath30 mass contributions are present , we can see that @xmath31 must necessarily be above @xmath32 in order to overcome the additional tachyonic contributions @xmath33 imposes on the sleptons . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we note that the up - squark mass still must be shifted lower in mass compared to the pure mssm amsb mass ( @xmath34 ) , and the down - squark mass still must be shifted higher in mass ( @xmath35 ) . </S>",
    "<S> only the left - squark doublet mass can be shifted either up or down in this case depending on the precise relationship between the parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> determining the mass of the squarks with respect to the pure - amsb value is another way to test the theory . </S>",
    "<S> precise measurements of heavy squarks are difficult at colliders , but it is profitable and feasible to answer simple binary questions of the form `` is this squark mass we just measured heavier or lighter than the pure amsb mass we infer for it from the gaugino spectrum ? ''    </S>",
    "<S> we also can state another important implication to the superpartner spectrum . </S>",

    "<S> , one could tell the difference between a general @xmath3 @xmath0-term contribution to the supersymmetry masses and contributions that arise from the combination of @xmath67 and @xmath80 ( or @xmath81 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the typical map of the latter to the former ( eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ damap ] and  [ qmap ] ) generates an irrational @xmath19 charge . </S>",
    "<S> this means the ratio of @xmath3 charges among the superpartners would be irrational , which is not expected for a sensible @xmath1 theory . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , we see no reasonable way these possibilities could be distinguished experimentally via superpartner measurements alone .    to add to the potential complexity of interpreting experiment , kinetic mixing of the form @xmath82 can also significantly change the effective charges , even if there is only one extra @xmath3 symmetry in the low - energy theory . </S>",
    "<S> if we apply the methods of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite to the present case of a not - so - hidden extra @xmath3 , we find that a hypercharge - mixed @xmath0-term contribution arises . </S>",
    "<S> its effects can be parametrized as , d_a^eff ( 1+r_y)d_a and q^eff . </S>",
    "<S> this is equivalent to the generation of the hypercharge @xmath0-term of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , except we are mixing it with a @xmath3 symmetry that is not necessarily the special case @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> we then map it back into a single @xmath0-term of @xmath83 again , albeit with a new charge @xmath84 which is likely to be irrational .    in the preceeding </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that we can map the entire space of interesting @xmath0-term induced solutions to the tachyonic slepton problem that do not disrupt supersymmetric gauge coupling unification into the two parameters @xmath19 and @xmath13 of the ancillary @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , this general result is especially satisfying , because it allows us to prove several interesting features of the superpartner spectrum independent of any specific model details . </S>",
    "<S> for example , it manifestly demonstrates that there is a definite sign of the @xmath0-term mass correction to each superpartner in this general approach . </S>",
    "<S> it also allowed us to prove the bound of all superpartners as expressed in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ masstheorem ] ) within any specific model consistent with our starting axiom that gauge coupling unification is not disrupted . </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath0-term solution of this motivated type leads to these unambiguous propositions regarding the superpartner spectrum and is therefore subject to experimental refutation . </S>"
