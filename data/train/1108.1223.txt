    "a phase  i trial for a new treatment is generally intended to determine a dose to use in subsequent phase  ii and iii testing .",
    "phase  i cancer trials have the additional complexity that the treatment in question is usually a cytotoxic agent and the efficacy usually increases with dose , and therefore it is widely accepted that some degree of toxicity must be tolerated to experience any substantial therapeutic effects .",
    "hence , an acceptable proportion @xmath0 of patients experiencing _ dose limiting toxicities _ ( dlts ) is generally agreed on before the trial , which depends on the type and severity of the dlt ; the dose resulting in this proportion is thus referred to as the _ maximum tolerated dose _ ( mtd ) .",
    "in addition to the explicitly stated objective of determining the mtd , a phase  i cancer trial also has the implicit goal of safe treatment of the patients in the trial . however , the aims of treating patients in the trial and generating an efficient design to estimate the mtd for future patients often run counter to each other . commonly used designs in phase  i cancer trials implicitly place their focus on the safety of the patients in the trial , beginning from a conservatively low starting dose and escalating cautiously .",
    "escalation is further slowed by the assignment of the same dose to groups of consecutive patients , as in the widely used 3-plus-3 design , which is convenient to administer and shortens trial duration by simultaneously following patients in groups of 3 .",
    "@xcite have documented that the overall response rates in these phase  i trials are low , and substantial numbers of patients are treated at doses that are retrospectively found to be non - therapeutic . moreover , as pointed out by @xcite , these designs are very inefficient for estimating the mtd , which is implied by the 3-plus-3 design to correspond to the case @xmath1 .",
    "they proposed a bayesian model - based design , called the `` continual reassessment method '' ( crm ) , to choose the dose levels sequentially , making use of all past data at each stage .",
    "more than ninety new phase  i methods were published between 1991 and 2006 @xcite , and there have been several reviews of the new methods ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . in this paper",
    "we focus on bayesian model - based designs and section  [ sec : framework ] describes a general framework to develop and analyze them . as shown in sections  [ sec : framework ] and [ sec : coh+1step ] , this framework allows one to incorporate the competing aims of a phase  i cancer trial by choosing the loss function accordingly .",
    "it also enables one to derive certain desirable properties of the design , such as coherence @xcite , from the loss function , or to enforce them by using simple reformulations in this framework .",
    "section  [ sec : examples ] provides implementation details and gives a simulation study comparing bayesian designs that correspond to different loss functions in the setting of a colon cancer trial considered by @xcite .",
    "a commonly used model - based approach to phase  i cancer clinical trial design assumes the usual logistic regression model for the probability  @xmath2 of dlt at dose level  @xmath3 : @xmath4 in which @xmath5 and @xmath6 is unknown and to be estimated from the observed pairs @xmath7 , where @xmath8 if the @xmath9th subject , treated at dose  @xmath10 , experiences dlt and @xmath11 otherwise .",
    "the frequentist approach to inference on @xmath12 uses the likelihood function and estimates @xmath12 by maximum likelihood , while the bayesian approach assumes a prior distribution of @xmath12 and uses the posterior distribution for inference on @xmath12 .",
    "denote the mtd by @xmath13 and the posterior distribution of @xmath12 based on @xmath14 by @xmath15 , and let @xmath16 denote the prior distribution .",
    "the bayes estimate of @xmath17 with respect to squared error loss is the posterior mean @xmath18 , and the crm proposed by @xcite uses this posterior mean to set the dose for the next patient , i.e. , @xmath19 . instead of the posterior mean",
    ", @xcite proposed to set @xmath20 equal to the @xmath21-quantile of the posterior distribution , where @xmath22 is chosen to be slightly less than @xmath0 in their examples .",
    "this design is called `` escalation with overdose control '' ( ewoc ) and @xmath21 is called the `` feasibility bound . '' a sequence of doses @xmath23 is called `` bayesian feasible '' at level @xmath24 if @xmath25 for all @xmath26 , and the ewoc doses are optimal among bayesian - feasible ones ; see @xcite .",
    "note that the dose for the @xmath27th patient in crm or ewoc depends only on the posterior distribution  @xmath28 , i.e. , @xmath23 is a functional @xmath29 of @xmath28 .",
    "this functional defines @xmath30 as a markov chain whose states are distributions on the parameter space  @xmath31 and whose state transitions are given by the following .",
    "_ bayesian updating scheme : _ given current state  @xmath32 ( which is a prior distribution of @xmath12 ) , let @xmath33 and generate first @xmath12 from @xmath32 and then @xmath34 .",
    "the new state is the posterior distribution of @xmath12 given @xmath35 .",
    "the functional @xmath33 for crm is @xmath36 , which minimizes the expected squared error loss @xmath37 $ ] . as pointed out by @xcite , the symmetric nature of the squared error loss",
    "may not be appropriate for modeling the toxic response to a cancer treatment . instead of squared error loss , ewoc with feasibility bound  @xmath21",
    "uses the functional @xmath38 that minimizes the asymmetric loss function @xmath39 $ ] , where @xmath40 more generally , we can consider other loss functions @xmath41 and define @xmath42 that attains @xmath43 $ ] . in particular , the following example gives a response - based version of ewoc .",
    "_ example 1 : inverted overdose control .",
    "_ the ewoc loss function ( [ eq : ewocloss ] ) penalizes an overdose @xmath44 by the amount @xmath45 , and an under - dose @xmath46 by the amount @xmath47 .",
    "however , a dose  @xmath3 deemed `` too large '' on this scale may actually correspond to a probability of dlt not much larger than the target rate  @xmath0 depending on the dose - response curve , making @xmath3 a relatively desirable dose .",
    "likewise , a small value of @xmath48 may correspond to a large discrepancy between the actual dlt probability  @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite suggest to measure the excess / deficit of the dlt rate on the `` probability scale . ''",
    "taking @xmath49 , this leads to the `` inverted '' loss function @xmath50    _ remark : _ the loss when the dose falls below @xmath17 , measured by the difference @xmath51 in ( [ eq : ewocloss ] ) and @xmath52 in ( [ eq : invewoc ] ) , should ideally be measured by the difference in response rates at @xmath17 and @xmath3 , respectively , when efficacy data , taking the value  @xmath53 if the patient responds to the treatment and @xmath54 otherwise , are also available besides the toxicity data .",
    "note , however , that this involves bivariate efficacy - toxicity data .",
    "while many existing designs solely consider toxicity outcomes and the mtd , designs that incorporate efficacy responses as well have been proposed by a number of authors , including @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . when efficacy responses are available , the _ minimum effective dose _",
    "( med ) is of interest , i.e. , the lowest dose at which some desired proportion of positive efficacy responses is attained . when both efficacy and toxicity data are available , the _ optimal safe dose _",
    ", which is the dose between the med and the mtd maximizing the probability of simultaneous efficacy and non - toxicity , is of interest .",
    "since this paper focuses on univariate toxicity data , we consider elsewhere better alternatives to ( [ eq : invewoc ] ) for @xmath55 that also require efficacy data .    noting that the explicitly stated objective of a phase  i cancer trial is to estimate the mtd",
    ", @xcite considered bayesian sequential designs that are optimal , in some sense , for this estimation problem .",
    "@xcite made use of the theory of optimal design of experiments @xcite to construct bayesian @xmath56- and @xmath57-optimal designs , and further imposed a relaxed bayesian feasibility constraint on the design to avoid highly toxic doses .",
    "optimal design theory involves a design measure  @xmath58 on the dose space  @xmath59 , and a sequential design updates the empirical design measure  @xmath60 at stage @xmath27 by changing it to @xmath61 with the addition of the dose  @xmath23 .",
    "the empirical measure  @xmath61 of the doses @xmath62 up to stage  @xmath27 can be represented by @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the probability measure degenerate at @xmath3 .",
    "we let @xmath65 denote the number of @xmath10 ( not necessarily distinct ) in the support of @xmath58 .",

    "we can easily extend our loss function approach to bayes sequential designs by including @xmath58 as an argument of the loss function in this setting .",

    "the measure @xmath84 in ( [ eq : ell - opt ] ) represents the new empirical measure obtained by adding @xmath3 to the support of @xmath58 , with @xmath85 .",
    "we can also impose a relaxed feasibility constraint in the choice of @xmath3 : @xmath86 as in @xcite , where @xmath87 with @xmath88 and @xmath21 is a prescribed positive constant . if @xmath89 , then @xmath90 and the constraint corresponds to requiring the doses to be bayesian feasible ( see the description of ewoc above ) .",

    "the following subsections extend this idea to address two important issues in phase  i cancer clinical trial designs .      motivated by ethical concerns , @xcite introduced coherence principles for sequential dose escalation or de - escalation .",
    "a dose sequence is said to be `` coherent '' if a higher ( respectively , lower ) dose is not given to the next patient when the current patient experiences ( respectively , does not experience ) dlt .",
    "in particular , crm and ewoc are coherent and the following theorem , whose proof is given in the appendix , provides conditions for the coherence of a bayes sequential design that minimizes the posterior loss at every stage .",
    "[ thm : coh ] suppose that the dose space is a finite interval and that @xmath92 is convex in @xmath3 for every fixed @xmath17 .",
    "assume that for fixed @xmath93 , @xmath94 is non - increasing in @xmath17 .",
    "then the dose sequence @xmath95 is coherent .",
    "theorem  [ thm : coh ] shows that crm is coherent since @xmath96 is convex and @xmath97 is non - increasing in @xmath17 for @xmath93 .",
    "the loss function  ( [ eq : ewocloss ] ) associated with ewoc also satisfies the assumption of theorem  [ thm : coh ] , which therefore shows the coherence of ewoc .",
    "the loss functions in examples  1 and 2 , however , may not satisfy the assumptions of theorem  [ thm : coh ] .",
    "moreover , a modification of ewoc recommended by its proponents @xcite , in which the feasibility bound is escalated throughout the trial from a low starting value to @xmath98 at the end of the trial , does not satisfy the assumptions of theorem  [ thm : coh ] and it indeed exhibits slight incoherence in the simulation studies in section  [ sec : examples ] .",
    "this can be understood by noting that , toward the end of the trial , the posterior distribution does not change much from patient to patient , and that an increase in the feasibility bound may overwhelm the slight downward shift in the posterior following an outcome  @xmath99 , causing a dose higher than the previous to be assigned .",
    "@xcite also found a certain two - stage modification of crm to be incoherent . on the other hand",
    ", we can enforce coherence by modifying @xmath100 into @xmath101 , where @xmath102      we have noted in section  [ sec : framework ] that crm or ewoc treats the next patient at the dose  @xmath3 that minimizes @xmath69 $ ] for @xmath92 given by @xmath103 or by ( [ eq : ewocloss ] ) , where @xmath32 is the current posterior distribution .",
    "this is tantamount to dosing the next patient at the best guess of @xmath17 , where `` best '' means `` closest '' according to some measure of distance from @xmath17 . on the other hand , a bayesian @xmath56- or @xmath57-optimal design aims at generating doses that provide most information , as measured by the fisher information matrix of a design measure , for estimating the dose - toxicity curve to benefit future patients . to resolve this dilemma between treatment of patients in the trial and efficient experimental design for post - trial parameter estimation",

    "the second summand considers the patient who follows and receives a myopic dose  @xmath131 which minimizes the patient s posterior loss ; the myopic dose is optimal because there are no more patients involved in ( [ eq:1-stp - ell ] ) .",
    "the effect of @xmath3 on this second patient is through the posterior distribution  @xmath130 that updates @xmath32 after observing @xmath132 , with @xmath133 .",
    "since @xmath134 is not yet observed , the expectation outside the curly brackets is taken over @xmath135 , with @xmath125 .",
    "for example , when implemented with @xmath136 given by the ewoc loss function  ( [ eq : ewocloss ] ) , this proposal can be viewed as a modification of ewoc since it utilizes its loss function but adds an additional term to represent the effect on future patients .    unlike @xmath116 in the discounted infinite - horizon problem , the choice of @xmath137 in ( [ eq:1-stp - ell ] )",
    "can exceed 1 and reflects the balance between the collective ethics in generating information for future patients and the individual ethics for the patient receiving the dose .",
    "although we use here a single patient to represent all patients following the one receiving the next dose , because the posterior distributions also change successively , the doses are functionals of these posterior distributions .",
