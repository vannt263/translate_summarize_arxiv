    "the continuing growth of wireless data services driven by smart devices and mobile broadband has encouraged researchers both in academia and industry to look ahead at how the fifth - generation ( 5 g ) network should be .",
    "the 5 g networks , which are expected to be rolled out soon after 2020 , will support a 1000 times higher average data traffic , 10 - 100 fold increase in data rate and connected devices , 5 times reduced latency and 10 times longer battery life @xcite .",
    "one of the solutions to meet the demand for high data rate is an ultra - dense deployment of a low power small base stations ( sbss ) , forming what is known as a multi - tier heterogeneous network ( hetnet ) @xcite . with an extreme dense deployment of small cells ( scs )",
    ", the users are brought closer to the serving base station ( bss ) which results in a better area spectral efficiency due to the higher spectrum reuse . however , a major challenge in such networks is how to design a high performance backhaul / fronthaul network that route the scs backhaul / fronthaul traffic to / from the core network .",
    "two fundamentally different backhauling / fronthauling possibilities exist , namely , wired and wireless backhaul / fronthaul networks . wired backhaul / fronthaul solutions include cooper and fiber .",
    "one may confidently state that fiber is always the best option .",
    "however , fiber does not always exist ubiquitously and installing new fiber for scs may not be an acceptable solution due to the high cost in many environments @xcite",
    ".    a more cost - effective alternative is wireless backhaul / fronthaul , where scs traffic is carried over microwave links or free - space optical ( fso ) links .",
    "the microwave backhaul is the dominant technology today and it is expected that 50% of backhaul / fronthaul deployment will be based on microwave by 2019 @xcite . moreover , line - of - sight ( los ) fso has recently gained attention as a promising backhaul / fronthaul technology as it relies on license free point - to - point ( ptp ) narrow beams to deliver the traffic .",
    "current backhauling / fronthauling solutions either wired or wireless are based on delivering the traffic of scs to an aggregation point ( central hub ) , which would be ideally located at an existing macrocell tower .",
    "the key challenge in designing such backhaul / fronthaul network is how to optimize the position of the central hubs .",
    "such a problem has been shown to be np - complete problem which even may not have optimal solution since with ultra - dense sc deployment , particularly in ultra - dense urban areas , some scs are hard to reach and los propagation is impossible @xcite . in such scenarios , rf non - los",
    "point - to - multipoint ( nlos ptm ) solutions which rely on licensed sub-6 ghz spectrum or microwave frequencies could be used at the expense of severe interference , congestion and high cost @xcite .",
    "therefore , a novel paradigm shift of backhaul / fronthaul network design for 5 g networks or beyond is needed .",
    "flying platforms have recently gained great interest in the communication sector @xcite .",
    "they can deliver cellular and internet services to remote and dedicated regions where infrastructure is not available and expensive to deploy .",
    "recently , facebook s project internet.org and google s project loon have been launched to provide internet coverage via stratosphere communications and https://www.google.com/loon/ for further information about the projects . ] .",
    "this article particularly addresses the following questions :    \\1 .",
    "can 5 g networks have a vertical backhaul / fronthaul network based on unmanned aerial vehicles ( uavs ) and fso ? .",
    "what are the challenges to integrate fso - based uavs into backhaul / fronthaul network ? .",
    "uavs are aircrafts which operate without a pilot on - board .",
    "they range in size from nano uavs to large - scale platforms .",
    "have 5 cm span / diameter and fly for a short time ( typically 1 minute ) while large - scale platforms are comparable in size to airships and designed to operate in the stratosphere at a relatively higher altitude ( typically 20 km ) . in this article",
    ", we consider uavs that can carry heavy payloads ( fso transceivers ) and operate in a quasi - stationary position or move on a pre - determined flight path .",
    "this operation mechanism allows ground stations or other network entities to track the uav or vice versa , and point the fso beam in the required direction .",
    "a uav can either fly autonomously or non - autonomously .",
    "in non - autonomous operation , the uav is controlled remotely by a human operator on the ground . in autonomous operation",
    ", the uav can perform the task , e.g. , collecting information without the need for direct human control .",
    "uavs can either operate in a single uav mode or a swarm of uavs . in a single uav operation ,",
    "the mission is performed by a single uav with no cooperation with other uavs , if they exist .",
    "uav swarm operation allows multiple interconnected uavs to cooperate and perform the mission autonomously with one of the uavs acting as the lead .",
    "uavs are mostly developed and used for military applications such as enemy surveillance and unmanned weapon .",
    "however , uavs can also perform a wide range of civil activities such as fire detection , power - line inspection , crop monitoring and spraying @xcite .",
    "recently , the uav industry and associated regulators adopted the term unmanned aircraft system ( uas ) to reflect the fact that these systems include other elements or sub - systems such as ground station , payload and data links besides the flying platform @xcite .",
    "functionality of the sub - systems is briefly described as follows :    * * control station ( cs ) : * cs usually deployed on ground or aboard ship .",
    "it provides an interface to control the launch , takeoff and operation of uav and payloads . * * payload : * payload includes all portable sub - systems or loads carried by the uav to perform the mission .",
    "payloads range from simple video cameras or sensors to a high power radar systems . *",
    "* uav : * the uav is a flying platform that carry payloads and other sub - systems needed for its operation such as fuel , control equipment , and communication links . *",
    "* tracking system ( ts ) : * for non - autonomous mission , the tracking system provides the operator with the precise location of the uav .",
    "ts includes global positioning system ( gps ) , radar tracking , and radio tracking equipment . *",
    "* communication link : * it allows data and control commands transfer between the cs and the uav .",
    "possible transmission means are radio frequencies and laser beams .",
    "the main contributions of this article are summarized as follows :    * we investigate the feasibility of a novel vertical backhaul / fronthaul framework that integrates uavs with fso technology to provide higher data rate backhaul / fronthaul links for hyper - dense sc hetnet . * we investigate the impact of several weather conditions on the data rates offered by a vertical fso link that supports a single sbs and multiple sbss ( in the absence of direct los between sc and uav ) .",
    "* we illustrate the potential savings in deployment cost of the vertical fso - based system compared to rf nlos , fiber optics and terrestrial fso backhaul / fronthaul deployments .",
    "* we present an overview of solutions for future implementation to increase achievable data rate and link margin under bad weather conditions .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , the proposed vertical backhaul / fronthaul system is introduced .",
    "section iii presents link budget analysis of fso - based vertical link in the proposed backhual / fronthaul framework . in section iv",
    ", we present several simulation results to investigate the performance of the system .",
    "this section also presents the associated cost savings of the proposed system in comparison with other existing backhaul / fronthaul technologies .",
    "section v presents open challenges and future research directions followed by conclusions presented in section vi .",
    "this section presents the proposed vertical uav - based backhaul / fronthaul network .    consider a multi - tier hetnet where ultra - dense scs overlaid with macrocells within some geographical area .",
    "the sbss collect traffic from users ( uplink traffic ) and forward it to the core network and receive user traffic from the core network and deliver it to the intended users ( downlink traffic ) .",
    "we assume that the sbss are located in hard to reach areas where fiber or microwave links are not readily available and expensive to deploy .",
    "the proposed backhaul / fronthaul network utilizes uavs and fso technology as a transport network that links the sbss and the core network .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows a graphical illustration of the proposed system referred to as vertical backhaul / fronthaul framework for 5g+ wireless networks .",
    "the proposed system has a vertical backhaul / fronthaul plane that comprises of several connected uavs flying at relatively lower altitude in comparison with commercial flights , we refer to them as the uav nodes .",
    "the uav nodes are assumed to fly autonomously in a swarm of uavs mode at some altitude @xmath0 depending on coverage area , weather conditions and the uav s serving capability .",
    "a uav s flying height could range from a few hundred meters to several kilometers ( typically 20 km ) .",
    "the swarm is controlled by a uav called a mother uav which also connects the swarm of uavs to the core network on the ground .",
    "the air - to - air uav s communication system is based on ptp fso beams , where each uav is connected to the mother uav by a fso link .",
    "the connectivity between sbss or aggregation points ( hub points ) and the flying uavs is also based on ptp fso beams .",
    "each sbs with a clear los link with a uav delivers / receives its uplink / downlink traffic to / from the intended uav via fso link . on the other hand , sbss with no los with a uav",
    "can be served by a nearby sbs which has a clear los with a uav . as a further option , instead of connecting every single sbs to a uav ,",
    "traffic is backhauled / fronthauled from a sbs to a uav through an aggregation point on the ground , where it is combined with traffic from other sbss and delivered to a uav by a fso beam .",
    "similarly , sbss served by uavs are equipped with tracking systems to automatically point the very directional beam to the desired uav .",
    "uavs are equipped with steerable fso units with optical beam steering devices to establish wireless links with the radio access technologies or hub points on ground via highly directional fso beams .",
    "the uplink traffic aggregated at the uav is delivered to the mother uav via fso link which in turn route the traffic to the ground core network via fso link .",
    "similarly , the downlink traffic originating from the core network is passed to the mother uav via a fso link .",
    "the mother uav then routes the backhaul / fronthaul traffic to its intended uav via fso beam which in turn delivers the traffic to the desired sbss on the ground .",
    "fso is an optical technology that relies on laser to send a very high bandwidth information data .",
    "the optical transmitter has an optical source which is often realized by a laser diode or a light emitting diode ( led ) .",
    "the receiver consists of a light detector that converts the light into an electrical waveform . unlike fiber optics where the light propagates through a guided channel , fso light propagates through unguided channel such as free space or outer space . while the optical signal propagates through the atmosphere , it experiences degradation as a result of absorption , scattering and turbulence .",
    "absorption and scattering are caused by molecules and particles suspended in the atmosphere which results in signal attenuation .",
    "turbulence , on the other hand , occurs due to temperature , pressure , and wind variations in the atmosphere .",
    "these variations cause fluctuations in atmospheric refractive index along the path length of fso beam which results in distortions in wavefront .",
    "the fso beam also faces other losses such as geometrical , pointing and optical losses . following sub - sections present various losses in the fso link due to the atmosphere and system design .",
    "absorption occurs when the photons of the fso beams collide with gaseous molecules which convert the photons into kinetic energy .",
    "absorption depends on the type of gas molecules and their concentration as well as on the transmission frequency of the optical beam .",
    "the wavelength selectivity of absorption allows specific frequencies to pass through it which results in transmission windows in which the absorption loss is negligible @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]          the ground - to - air or air - to - ground fso links can support a single sbs or multiple sbss . in the case of supporting multiple sbss , traffic is backhauled / fronthauled from multiple sbss to an aggregation point via wireless / wired high capacity fso links . the number of aggregated sbss that a single fso link can support depends on the achievable data rate on the fso link @xmath1 and the estimated backhaul / fronthaul traffic for the scs",
    ". the backhaul / fronthaul traffic could be estimated as described in a study performed by next generation mobile networks ( ngmn ) alliance . as an example",
    ", an aggregated backhaul / fronthaul traffic @xmath2 generated by @xmath3 sbss can be estimated as @xmath4=max@xmath5 , where @xmath6 denotes the average traffic during busy time for a single sbs when many users are being served by the respective cell and @xmath7 denotes the peak cell throughput . in a largely populated downtown areas ,",
    "the aggregated backhaul / fronthaul traffic @xmath2 is driven by data rate during busy times .",
    "in such a scenario , the fso link can support up to @xmath8 sbss where @xmath9 denotes the ceiling function .",
    "the achievable data rate of a fso link is given by @xcite @xmath10,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 denotes the transmit power , @xmath12 and @xmath13 stand for the optical efficiencies of the transmitter and receiver , respectively , @xmath14 is the pointing loss measured in db , @xmath15 denotes the atmospheric attenuation due to rain , fog , cloud or turbulence measured in db over the path length and given by @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , @xmath17 denotes the photon energy with @xmath18 denotes planck s constant , @xmath19 denotes the speed of light and @xmath20 stands for transmission wavelength . finally , @xmath21 represents the receiver sensitivity in number of photons / bit . unless otherwise specified , table ii summarizes the simulation parameters used in this article .",
    "2 shows the achievable data rate and available link margin versus uav altitude for different weather conditions . as shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) , with the increase in uav altitude , the achievable data rate decreases for all weather conditions due to the increase in geometrical loss .",
    "it can also be seen that the vertical fso link is mostly affected by the clouds because the wavelength of fso beam is comparable to the size of the cloud particles ( mie scattering ) .",
    "although fog also causes mie scattering as clouds do , fog may not be a key issue for the vertical fso links as for terrestrial fso links because the vertical fso beam is vulnerable to fog for a relatively much shorter distance ( fog layer thickness ) while terrestrial fso link is vulnerable to fog along the communication link .",
    "for all weather conditions except clear sky , the data rates at higher altitudes are relatively lower as compared to clear sky , e.g. , at an altitude of 20 km , @xmath22198 kbits / s , 0.5 mbits / s and 42 gbits / s for clouds and fog , heavy rain and clear sky , respectively .",
    "2(b ) illustrates the available link margin versus uav altitude for different weather conditions .",
    "as seen in this figure , 23 db and 11.5 db are available at an altitude of 5 km and 20 km , respectively , for a clear sky . under cloudy , raining and foggy conditions , the fso link fails because the received power is less than the sensitivity of the receiver , e.g. , the available link margin is -42 db for cloudy and foggy conditions at 20 km .",
    "3 shows the achievable data rate and link margin for cloudy and foggy conditions ( worst scenario ) over the range of uav altitude for different divergence angles . as seen in fig .",
    "3(a ) , the achievable data rate can be improved by reducing the divergence angle , e.g. , a data rate of 198 kbits / s , 1.6 gbits / s , and 46 gbits / s can be achieved with a divergence angle of 1 mrad , 10 @xmath23rad , and 1 @xmath23rad , respectively , at an altitude of 20 km .",
    "it can also be seen in fig .",
    "3(b ) that reducing the divergence angle results in increasing the available link margin at the receiver , e.g. , at an altitude of 20 km , a link margin of 12 db is available at the receiver with a divergence angle of 1 @xmath23rad compared to -2.6 db ( link failure ) with a divergence angle of 10 @xmath23rad .      in this subsection , we compare the deployment cost for nlos ptm , optical fiber , terrestrial fso and fso - based vertical solutions .",
    "consider a hetnet where 100 macrocells and 1000 scs are deployed over an urban area of 5 km by 5 km .",
    "for rf nlos ptm , fiber optics and fso solutions , we assume that the scs backhaul / fronthaul traffic is aggregated at an aggregation hub located at the macrocell bs where a high speed wired / wireless backhaul connection is available . for rf nlos ptm , the configuration is assumed to be 1:4 , i.e. , a hub ; located at a macrocell bs communicates with 4 remote backhaul modules located at the scs .",
    "the cost of the hub and remote backhaul module is assumed as $ 4000 and $ 2000 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the installation cost for the hub and remote backhaul module is assumed as $ 270 and $ 140 , respectively .",
    "we also assume that the rf nlos ptm solution operates in a 40 mhz licensed spectrum at the cost of $ 0.007 per mhz per capita .",
    "for the optical fiber , the fiber optic cable is available at $ 10 per meter and the installation cost is $ 200 per meter . for the terrestrial fso",
    ", we assume that 50% of the scs have no los to the aggregation hubs , which is the case in urban areas , particularly , downtowns where the scs are expected to be deployed near street levels rather than in clear spaces . therefore , two or more terrestrial fso links may be required to reach the sc .",
    "the cost of the terrestrial fso equipment is assumed as $ 15,000 and the associated planning and installation cost is further assumed as $ 5000 .",
    "for the proposed vertical solution , we assume 20 platforms flying at an altitude where a reliable link is possible .",
    "the cost of the platform is assumed as $ 50,000 .",
    "4(a ) shows a snapshot of the typical poisson distributed hetnet used to estimate the deployment cost of backhaul / fronthaul links .",
    "4(b ) shows the deployment cost for rf nlos ptm , optical fiber , terrestrial fso and fso - based vertical systems .",
    "it can be seen from the fig .",
    "4(b ) that fiber optics has the highest deployment cost because of the high cost of digging and trenching in urban areas . on the other hand",
    ", the rf nlos solution seems to be the most cost effective solution but it suffers from interference and low data rate due to spectrum sharing between remote backhaul modules .",
    "although , terrestrial fso seems to be an attractive solution as it provides high data rate with no interference compared to rf nlos solution , it is not suitable for backhauling / fronthauling scs deployed in urban areas as los is not always available .",
    "therefore , more fso equipment is required to reach the scs which significantly increases the deployment cost . to reduce the deployment cost of terrestrial fso solution",
    ", the aggregation hub can be implemented in the stratosphere instead of ground where it is more likely to have a los between the scs and flying uavs .",
    "it has been shown that the proposed fso - based vertical solution provides over 28% cost savings compared to terrestrial fso and 65% cost savings compared to optical fiber .",
    "as previously discussed in this article , the vertical fso link is greatly affected by weather conditions ; in particular , clouds accompanied by fog , strong wind conditions , etc .",
    "this presents implementation limitations on the performance of the vertical fso link , resulting either in link failure or very low data rates .",
    "such limitations motivate investigating other approaches to compensate the link degradation .",
    "one possible approach is to design an adaptive algorithm that adjusts the transmit power according to weather conditions , e.g. , under raining conditions , high power vertical fso beams should be used while low power beams could be used under clear sky conditions .",
    "the algorithm may also adjust other system parameters such as divergence angle of the fso transceiver to compensate the link degradation and thereby guarantee the link sustainability under different weather conditions . in the case of complete failure of vertical fso link where link adaptation is not possible due to system limitations and bad weather conditions",
    ", the future implementation may also include a system optimization algorithm that can jointly optimize the uav altitude and placement , e.g. , flying below clouds over negligible turbulence region and coordinate the link selectivity between the scs to maintain a satisfactory performance and prevent the failure of proposed system .",
    "hybrid fso / rf system could also be considered as a potential alternative solution to overcome the link degradation under bad weather conditions @xcite .",
    "the regulation ( safety , environment , etc . ) to exploit the uavs for such commercial use in future cellular networks is still underway .",
    "several canadian , us and european organizations , such as canadian aviation regulations , transport canada , us federal aviation authority ( faa ) , regulatory cooperation council ( rcc ) , us - canada joint working group and the european union have been working very closely for the last couple of years to harmonize the regulatory approaches for flying uavs in their respective airspaces for commercial use including their usage for future cellular services .",
    "the regulatory processes include , but not limited to , issuance of flight operating licenses and air operator certificates to the cellular operators or any other commercial agency to authorize the flying of uavs and ensure that the uav flight is equipped with the adequate safety equipment for various environments and capable of managing the risk associated with the operation of uavs .",
    "the current focus of regulatory bodies is largely on the safety aspects of uav flight , particularly if they are to operate beyond los and in populated urban areas .",
    "the key sub - sections in regulatory organizations are working on directing the implementation of draft plans , standards , and rules to ensure that uavs integration proceeds in a safe and legal manner .",
    "recently , it has been also anticipated that the relaxing of some restrictions in commercial use of uavs will approve around 30,000 - 50,000 uavs to fly in canadian and us skies in next 15 - 20 years . at present",
    ", there are 300 commercial licenses in just canada to operate these uavs for commercial purpose .      with densely deployment of scs ,",
    "the uav - small cell association becomes more challenging in underlying vertical systems .",
    "each uav has a constraint on the payload it can carry .",
    "therefore , each uav can serve at most a particular number of scs because of the limited number of fso transceivers it can fly with .",
    "furthermore , the uav - backhaul link that forwards the traffic from the uav node to the mother uav or vice versa could be strictly constrained by the limited capacity of that link .",
    "therefore , even if the uavs carry enough fso transceivers , the number of scs served by each uav could be limited by the capacity of the uav - backhaul link .",
    "it is clear that successful integration of the proposed vertical fronthaul / backhaul system relies on advanced optimization of sophisticated design parameters such as optimal number of uavs required to provide fronthaul / backhaul to the scs and their association with the scs considering the typical factors , e.g. , payload , achieving data rate and backhaul data rate between uav and ground station .",
    "security and privacy for uavs are considered as fundamental requirements for proposed vertical system . in general",
    ", the use of uavs for the future cellular networks could be limited due to following two reasons :    * the security risk that the uavs could be hijacked / sabotaged may result in disruption or complete failure of cellular systems and services .",
    "operators , cellular vendors or any other commercial agency intending to exploit uavs for commercial services , are required to integrate advanced control mechanisms to ensure the security of the uavs and their operation . *",
    "the privacy and data protection of the cellular network entities that are connected to the uavs could also be at risk due to inadequate security measures .",
    "some regulatory measures could be taken to maintain additional privacy and protection of the cellular entities in the uav - based network such as prohibiting the uavs from flying over critical and unauthorized infrastructure and from carrying payload that could potentially collect personal data and information .",
    "in this article , we investigated the possibility of a vertical backhaul / fronthaul framework based on uavs and the fso technology .",
    "the uavs link the ultra - dense small cells , some of which are deployed in hard - to - reach areas to the core network on the ground .",
    "the uavs operate autonomously in a swarm mode where a mother uav connects the swarm uavs to the core network .",
    "the link budget and achievable data rate for a single fso link under different weather conditions have been investigated to determine the viability of the proposed framework .",
    "finally , simulations have shown that the key challenge in establishing such a framework is the high path loss under some weather conditions , in particular , the attenuation due to clouds accompanied by fog .",
    "in such a scenario , the performance can be improved significantly and rates in the order of multi gbits / s can be achieved by a careful design of the vertical fso framework , e.g. , by reducing the divergence angle which in turn reduces the geometrical loss .",
    "the economics of deployment has also shown that the proposed fso - based approach can become a promising cost - effective solution for backhauling / fronthauling in 5g+ wireless networks . moreover , with the technological advancements and the application of emerging use cases of the underlying technologies , the cost of the proposed framework and the associated equipment may drop substantially in the long run ."
