    "cosmological gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) evidently involve the emission of the isotropic equivalent of @xmath2 on a typical time scale of a few seconds in the vicinity of a newly formed stellar - mass black hole or rapidly rotating neutron star ( see reviews by @xcite and @xcite ) . to avoid strong attenuation of the @xmath0-rays by pair - production interactions with lower - energy photons ( the `` compactness '' problem ) , the lorentz factor @xmath0 of the emitting gas must exceed @xmath3 .",
    "the most natural way of powering the burst seems to be the conversion of the kinetic energy of the relativistic outflow into nonthermal ( most likely synchrotron ) radiation . because of",
    "the high initial energy density and characteristic photon energy , the dynamical evolution of grbs has traditionally been modeled in terms of the expansion of an initially opaque electron - positron ( @xmath4 ) fireball .",
    "although a pure-@xmath4 fireball could in principle attain @xmath5 in the optically thin region where the observed emission must originate , the fraction of the energy carried by pairs would be only @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "if , however , the fireball contains enough baryons ( of total mass @xmath7 ) that it becomes `` matter dominated '' before it gets optically thin , then most of its initial ( suffix @xmath8 ) energy @xmath9 is converted into bulk kinetic energy of baryons ( with asymptotic lorentz factors @xmath10 ) instead of escaping as radiation .",
    "baryon loading of the fireball at the source is expected in view of the highly super - eddington luminosity involved , and viable models in fact face the issue of why it is not so efficient as to render @xmath11 too low ( the `` baryon contamination '' problem ) .    according to currently accepted grb formation scenarios , the burst is powered by the extraction of rotational energy from the central black hole or neutron star , or , alternatively , from the debris disk left behind when the mass near the origin collapses into a black hole . in either case ,",
    "strong ( @xmath12 ) magnetic fields provide the most plausible means of extracting the energy @xmath9 on the burst time scale . if the field were initially weaker , it would likely be rapidly amplified by differential rotation or dynamo action to the requisite strength .",
    "the magnetic energy might be dissipated near the origin in a series of flares , giving rise to a `` magnetic '' fireball ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , the magnetic field may have a large - scale , ordered component that could help guide and collimate the outflow , and , if it is strong enough , also contribute to its acceleration ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "even if the flow is not magnetically driven , the field may be strong enough to account for the observed synchrotron emission @xcite .",
    "magnetic collimation is , in fact , consistent with the observational indications for grb jets ( e.g. , @xcite ) and could be very helpful in reducing the source energy requirements to plausible values .",
    "furthermore , if the outflow is largely poynting flux - dominated , then the implied lower radiative luminosity near the origin could alleviate the baryon contamination problem .",
    "magnetic fields have thus come to be regarded as the favored means of driving grb outflows .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to provide an overview of the magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) of grb outflows , clarifying the relationship between the thermal ( fireball ) and lorentz accelerations , identifying the parameter regimes where qualitatively different behaviors are expected , and demonstrating that the observationally inferred properties of these outflows can be attributed to magnetic driving .",
    "a detailed exposition of the semianalytic solutions on which this overview is based is given in n. vlahakis & a. knigl , in preparation ( hereafter vk ) .",
    "for the purpose of illustration , we assume that the outflow originates in a debris disk around a stellar - mass black hole ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in light of the considerations of  1 , we concentrate on the case of a magnetically driven , axial jet that has a sufficiently high baryon loading to insure that it is matter dominated when it becomes optically thin ( see  [ baryon ] ) , and in which a significant fraction of the poynting flux is eventually converted into kinetic energy . as discussed by spruit et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , such configurations can be validly described by the mhd approximation on the spatial scales of interest , and , furthermore , they are not expected to dissipate a substantial amount of magnetic energy along the way .",
    "correspondingly , we adopt the equations of relativistic , ideal mhd to describe the flow .",
    "we anticipate that , near the origin , the thermal energy associated with the radiation and @xmath4 pairs is nonnegligible and that the optical depth is large enough to ensure local thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "we therefore assume that the gas ( consisting of baryons with their neutralizing electrons as well as of photons and pairs ) evolves adiabatically with a polytropic index of 4/3 . assuming a quasi - steady poloidal magnetic flux function @xmath13 and changing variables from @xmath14 to @xmath15 , with @xmath16 the arclength along a poloidal fieldline , it can be shown that all terms with derivatives with respect to @xmath17 are negligible when the flow is highly relativistic .",
    "as is elaborated on in vk , the equations are then effectively time independent and the motion can be described as a frozen pulse whose internal profile is specified through the variable @xmath17 ( see also piran 1999 ) .",
    "we discuss time - dependent effects in  [ application ] .",
    "assuming also axisymmetry , the full set of mhd equations can be partially integrated to yield several field - line constants : the mass - to - magnetic flux ratio @xmath18 , the field angular velocity @xmath19 ( which equals the matter angular velocity at the footpoint of the field line in the disk ) , the total ( kinetic + magnetic ) specific angular momentum @xmath20 , the total energy - to - mass flux ratio @xmath21 , and the adiabat @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are , respectively , the rest - mass density and total gas pressure measured in the fluid frame ) . two integrals remain to be performed , involving the bernoulli and transfield force - balance equations .",
    "there are correspondingly two unknown functions , which we choose for convenience to be @xmath25 , the radial distance of the field line [ in cylindrical coordinates @xmath26 in units of the `` light cylinder '' radius , and the `` alfvnic '' mach number @xmath27 ( where @xmath28 is the enthalpy - to - rest energy ratio , and where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the poloidal components of the velocity and magnetic field , respectively , measured in the central object s frame ) .",
    "the solutions derived in vk are obtained under the most general ansatz for radial self - similarity [ in spherical coordinates @xmath31 , in which the shape @xmath32 of the poloidal field lines is given as a product of a function of @xmath13 times a function of @xmath33 : @xmath34 ( or , equivalently , @xmath35 $ ] ; @xcite ) .",
    "initially , the outflow evolves as a fireball : it expands isotropically in the comoving frame , with the large - scale field only acting as a guide ( e.g. , mszros et al .",
    "if the baryon loading is large enough , this continues until all the thermal energy of the radiation field and the pairs is transformed into kinetic energy of the baryons .",
    "subsequently , the lorentz force converts poynting flux into baryon kinetic energy , and it also collimates the flow . the lorentz force remains dominant ( implying that the field is force free ) all the way to the point where the kinetic energy of the baryons becomes comparable to the electromagnetic energy .",
    "we assume that the asymptotic shape of the flow is cylindrical and that the final stage is characterized by an equipartition between the poynting and kinetic energy fluxes .",
    "( the latter assumption is motivated by the exact `` cold '' solutions of @xcite . )",
    "the transition from a parabolic to a cylindrical shape occurs far downstream from the alfvn point ( @xmath36 ) , where the ratio of the kinetic energy flux @xmath37 to the poynting flux @xmath38 ( where @xmath39 is the electric field amplitude ) equals @xmath40 . if @xmath41 is the ( small ) opening half - angle of the outflow , then @xmath42 . substituting this into the bernoulli equation",
    ", we find the slope of the field lines @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the magnetization parameter .",
    "equipartition between the poynting and kinetic energy fluxes @xmath45 in the final cylindrical stage @xmath46 means that @xmath47 .",
    "substituting this into equation ( [ slope ] ) and specializing to the force - free @xmath48 parabolic regime , gives @xmath49 , so the shape of the force - free field lines is @xmath50 , with @xmath51 the initial opening half - angle ( cf .",
    "beyond the light surface ( which is close to the alfvn surface , since the flow is nearly force free ) , the large - scale electromagnetic field is given by @xmath52 the comoving field amplitude satisfies @xmath53 ( a lorentz invariant ) and @xmath54 , which together imply @xmath55 ( or , equivalently , @xmath56 ) .",
    "we approximate the outflow as a pair of shells that move in opposite directions from the debris disk , each having an initial meridional cross section @xmath57 , with @xmath58 comparable to @xmath59 ( the mean radius of the debris disk ) and @xmath60 cm ( where @xmath61 is the total duration of the burst ) .",
    "the total baryonic mass of outflowing matter is @xmath62 where @xmath63 .",
    "the total energy is @xmath64 , and initially it resides predominantly in the electromagnetic field ; the initial thermal energy ( associated with the enthalpy of the photons and pairs ) is @xmath65 .",
    "the constancy of the mass - to - magnetic flux ratio @xmath66 and equation ( [ fields ] ) imply @xmath67 if @xmath68 is the temperature in units of the electron rest energy , then , by the conservation of specific entropy along the flow , @xmath69 , or ( since @xmath70 ) @xmath71 energy flux conservation , in turn , gives @xmath72 so long as @xmath73 ( the fireball phase ) , @xmath74 .",
    "also , by equation ( [ energy ] ) , @xmath75 is constant since the specific poynting flux does not vary along the flow for a force - free field .",
    "equations @xmath76 thus imply @xmath77 these scalings are the same as in a spherically symmetric , hydrodynamic ( hd ) fireball , except that the cylindrical radius @xmath78 replaces the spherical radius @xmath79 in the magnetically guided case .    beyond the point where @xmath80 , magnetic acceleration takes over and the lorentz factor continues to increase until the cylindrical regime ( @xmath81 )",
    "is reached .",
    "the magnetic acceleration is associated with a small ( linear in @xmath78 ) deviation of the poynting flux from its force - free value , @xmath82 by combining equation ( [ poynting ] ) with equations ( [ energy ] ) and ( [ continuity ] ) , it is seen that the scalings of @xmath0 and @xmath23 with @xmath78 given by equation ( [ scale ] ) are maintained also in the magnetic acceleration zone .",
    "in fact , since the density in the central object s frame is @xmath83 and the @xmath78-width of the shell ( given the parabolic shape of the field lines ) evolves as @xmath84 , mass conservation implies that , while the flow continues to expand isotropically in the comoving frame , the width of the shell remains constant [ @xmath85 in the central source s frame ( consistent with the frozen - pulse approximation ) .",
    "two parameters determine the basic character of the flow :    the first is the initial enthalpy of the flow in units of the rest energy of the baryonic component , @xmath86 , where we approximate the initial radiation field by a blackbody distribution and the @xmath4 pairs by a maxwellian distribution .",
    "the second is the initial poynting flux in units of the baryon rest- energy flux .",
    "as we focus on poynting flux - dominated outflows , this ratio is @xmath87 .    initially the flow is optically thick .",
    "the distance where it becomes optically thin is determined by @xmath88 .",
    "the pertinent regimes of this parameter were previously analyzed for the case of a radially expanding hd fireball ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we now adapt this analysis to the present ( nonradial ) geometry .",
    "the opacity has two contributions : one due to pairs ( @xmath89 ) and another due to the electrons that neutralize the baryons ( @xmath90 )",
    ". as the flow expands , its temperature decreases . when @xmath91 , the pair number density becomes negligible and the opacity from there on is determined by the neutralizing electrons . for the radiation - dominated case , @xmath92 at that point , corresponding to @xmath93 ( with @xmath94 ) . if @xmath95 , the flow continues to be optically thick until @xmath96 .",
    "if at that point the radiation energy density exceeds the baryon rest - energy density , then one is still in the radiation - dominated regime .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath97 , with @xmath98 . for @xmath99 ,",
    "the flow is matter dominated when it becomes optically thin .",
    "finally , @xmath100 correspond to the cold limit .",
    "since magnetic acceleration now plays a role , the outflow is not necessarily nonrelativistic in this limit : only if @xmath101 also holds will the flow be newtonian .",
    "the most plausible regime for grb outflows is @xmath102 , and we adopt it from here on .",
    "as the flow moves outward it passes through the following points ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) : + 1 .",
    "@xmath103 : origin of the outflow , @xmath104 .",
    "@xmath105 : slow - magnetosonic surface , @xmath106 .",
    "@xmath107 : alfvn ( @xmath108 light ) surface .",
    "@xmath109 : classical fast - magnetosonic surface , @xmath110 .",
    "unlike the purely radial case @xcite , this point is located at a finite distance from the origin .",
    "the bulk of the magnetic acceleration occurs downstream from this point through the `` magnetic nozzle '' mechanism ( li et al .",
    "in essence , this term is a shorthand for the fact that an mhd flow can continue to accelerate until it crosses the modified fast - magnetosonic singular surface .",
    "this effect is not purely relativistic : it is manifested in an exact solution of the nonrelativistic mhd equations where all the singular surfaces ( including the modified - fast one ) are crossed @xcite , and there , too , most of the acceleration occurs downstream of the classical fast - magnetosonic surface ( but _ upstream _ of the modified - fast surface ) .",
    "@xmath111 : @xmath112 .",
    "@xmath113 : end of thermal acceleration , @xmath114 .",
    "the entire initial thermal energy of the photons and pairs has by this point been converted into baryon kinetic energy .",
    "magnetic acceleration effectively starts here .",
    "@xmath115 : @xmath116 , the flow becomes optically thin to compton scattering .",
    "@xmath117 : cylindrical flow regime .",
    "near - equipartition between the poynting and the baryon kinetic - energy fluxes is attained , with @xmath118 .",
    "the inequalities @xmath119 always hold , as do , in the regime of interest , @xmath120 ( valid for @xmath121 ) and @xmath122 ( valid for @xmath123 ) .",
    "the validity condition for the inequality @xmath124 , which expresses the requirement that the flow be optically thin to compton scattering in its final ( cylindrical ) stage , corresponds to an upper bound on the baryon loading : @xmath125 [ or @xmath126 .",
    "we note , however , that the increase of @xmath0 with @xmath78 is slower than linear as the cylindrical regime is approached ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , which implies that @xmath127 is larger than @xmath128 and the actual upper bound on the initial baryon mass density is larger than the analytic estimate ( typically by a factor of a few ) .",
    "all of the above points are indicated in figure [ fig1 ] , where an illustrative solution of the steady , relativistic mhd equations is presented .",
    "the figure demonstrates the validity of the scaling @xmath129 over several decades in @xmath78 and the separation of the thermal ( @xmath130 ) and magnetic ( @xmath131 ) acceleration regimes .",
    "it also manifests the significant collimation from the comparatively large initial opening half - angle ( @xmath132 ) to a very nearly cylindrical geometry ( attained on scales @xmath133 from the origin ) .",
    "equation ( [ poynting ] ) for the poynting flux is also verified .",
    "it is , furthermore , seen that approximate equipartition ( @xmath134 ) holds during the final phase of the flow .",
    "to demonstrate how the model outflows discussed in  [ structure ] could account for observed grbs , we adopt as fiducial source parameters a @xmath0-ray fluence of @xmath135 and a distance @xmath136 , which imply an isotropic equivalent energy of @xmath137 .",
    "if the @xmath0-ray emitting material is in fact confined to a pair of cones of opening half - angle @xmath138 , then the actual radiated energy is @xmath139 .",
    "as we noted in  1 , the emission is believed to be powered by the kinetic energy of the relativistic outflow , and the most common interpretation is in terms of internal shocks produced by the collision of overtaking shells ( see * ? ? ?",
    "assuming that the kinetic - to - radiative energy conversion efficiency is @xmath140 and that the magnetic stresses can transfer as much as @xmath141 of the initial energy into baryon kinetic energy , we infer @xmath142 .",
    "if the energy is deposited in the form of a poynting flux over @xmath143 , then the field at the origin must be @xmath144 for @xmath145 and @xmath146 ( representative of a debris disk that extends to the last stable orbit of a rotating solar - mass black hole ) . to satisfy the constraint @xmath124 ( see  5 ) ,",
    "the maximum baryonic rest - mass density is @xmath147 . in the solution presented in figure 1",
    ", we adopted as a plausible temperature @xmath148 , corresponding to @xmath149 .",
    "the variability properties of the observed grbs have been interpreted in terms of @xmath150 distinct shells that are ejected with slightly different lorentz factors and whose subsequent collisions give rise to the `` internal '' shocks responsible for the @xmath0-ray emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) . adopting @xmath151 , one may integrate the equation of motion for each shell and show that two neighboring shells starting with @xmath152 will not collide for as long as they move in the flow acceleration zone .",
    "only after the shells reach the constant - velocity , cylindrical flow regime , will the two shells collide ( at a height @xmath153 , assuming an initial separation @xmath154 ) .",
    "a lower bound on the lorentz factor in this region can be obtained from the requirement that the optical depth to photon - photon pair production be less than 1 : @xmath155 , where @xmath156 is the energy of a test photon , @xmath157 is the hubble constant , and @xmath158 is the redshift @xcite .",
    "the solution exhibited in figure [ fig1 ] demonstrates that magnetically accelerated flows can attain the requisite high values of @xmath0 .",
    "although our analysis can be generalized to arbitrary magnetic field configurations , we have concentrated on the self - similar form for which we have exact solutions of the mhd equations ( see vk ) .",
    "real grb outflows evidently have a finite opening half - angle ( estimated to be at least @xmath159 on average ; mszros et al .",
    "1999 ) , and thus are not accurately represented by our asymptotically cylindrical solutions .",
    "this discrepancy should not , however , affect our basic conclusions about the robustness of the magnetic acceleration mechanism for these flows .",
    "it remains a challenge for future work to find exact solutions with conical asymptotics .",
    "we note in this connection that , although the outflowing `` shells '' conceivably do not fill the entire solid angle into which they are ejected , the internal shock mechanism requires that multiple shells be ejected along any given direction ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the guiding property of a magnetic field in an mhd - driven outflow provides a natural physical basis for this picture .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that ordered magnetic fields can transform up to @xmath160 of the energy deposited by the central source of a grb into kinetic energy of a collimated flow of baryons with @xmath161 .",
    "this energy , in turn , may be converted into radiation by internal shocks ."
