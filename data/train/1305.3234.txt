    "thom polynomials count how many fibers of a generic proper morphism of a smooth variety have a prescribed collection of singularities .",
    "more generally , they count the cohomology class of a multisingularity stratum ( the closure of the set of all points , whose preimages have a prescribed collection of singularities ) . historically , the first thom polynomials are the plucker formulas , expressing the degree and the number of cusps and double points of the curve @xmath2 projectively dual to a generic plane curve @xmath3 in terms of the degree of @xmath3 . to see these expressions as thom polynomials , note that @xmath2 is the discriminant of the tautological projection @xmath4 i.e. the closure of all points @xmath5 , whose fiber under @xmath6 has one singularity of local degree 2 ( @xmath7 singularity ) .",
    "similarly , the cusps and double points of @xmath2 are the images of the fibers with one singularity of local degree 3 ( @xmath8 singularity ) or two @xmath7 singularities respectively .",
    "so the dual curve @xmath2 , the set of its cusps and the set of its double points are the multisingularity strata of the projection @xmath6 .",
    "the contemporary versions of the plucker formulas are the thom polynomials , expressing the fundamental classes of the multisingularity strata for a generic map @xmath9 of arbitrary compact smooth surfaces in terms of the characteristic classes of these surfaces : that is , the fundamental classes of the three multisingularity strata in @xmath10 equal the direct images of @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively , where @xmath13 are the characteristic classes of the virtual vector bundle @xmath14 .",
    "we give @xcite as a general reference for this fact and all subsequent appeals to thom polynomials and multisingularity theory . in the special case of the tautological projection @xmath15 ,",
    "the characteristic classes are functions of the degree @xmath16 of the given curve @xmath3 , the fundamental class of the stratum @xmath2 in @xmath17 equals @xmath18 and counts its degree , and the fundamental classes of the 0-dimensional multisingularity strata in @xmath19 equal @xmath20 and @xmath21 and count their cardinality .",
    "we shall make the first steps towards computation of _ affine thom polynomials _ that count how many fibers of a generic polynomial map of an affine algebraic variety have a prescribed collection of singularities .",
    "an example of the affine version of the plucker formulas is as follows .",
    "[ exa1 ] let @xmath13 be a generic polynomial of a given degree .",
    "for how many values of the parameter @xmath22 , is the polynomial @xmath23 not morse ?    to answer this question ,",
    "let @xmath6 be the restriction of the projection @xmath24 , to the graph @xmath25 , and let @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath26 be its multisingularity strata .",
    "the sought number of non - morse polynomials equals the cardinality @xmath27 , which can be found from the following three equations .",
    "denote the euler characteristics by @xmath28 and define @xmath29 to be the minimal concave non - negative function such that @xmath30 for every @xmath31 . in this notation ,",
    "the three equations are    @xmath32    @xmath33    @xmath34    [ rem00 ] all three equations can be deduced from certain variations of the kouchnirenko - bernstein - khovanskii formula @xcite for slightly degenerate complete intersections : we should count the euler characteristics of @xmath35 , the set of critical points of @xmath6 , and the set of critical values of @xmath6 respectively . note that we could not reduce this problem to classical thom polynomials by compactifying the ambient tori @xmath36 and @xmath37 : any such compactification would give a highly non - generic projection of the closure of @xmath35 , to which classical thom polynomials are not applicable .      in order to obtain an affine version of the plucker formula for degree",
    ", we have to choose a cohomology - like ring , in which we shall compute the fundamental class of the discriminant of @xmath6 .",
    "remark [ rem00 ] suggests that the chow ring of any particular compactification of @xmath37 is not a good choice .",
    "for this reason we shall switch to the direct limit of the cohomology of all toric compactifications of a complex torus @xmath38 . we shall call this graded ring the _ affine cohomology _ and denote it by @xmath39 .",
    "the ring @xmath39 governs all equivariant enumerative problems in @xmath38 in the sense that the subvarieties @xmath35 , @xmath40 have the same fundamental class in @xmath39 if and only if every subvariety of complementary codimension , shifted by a generic element of the torus , has the same intersection number with @xmath35 as with @xmath41 .",
    "this fact was first noticed in @xcite for certain homogeneous spaces different from complex tori , but all of the arguments in this important paper are actually applicable to arbitrary spherical homogeneous spaces , including @xmath38 ( see also @xcite and @xcite for details on the spherical setting ) .",
    "the affine cohomology ring of the complex torus is isomorphic to the polytope algebra , which had been introduced in @xcite and extensively studied ( @xcite , @xcite ) by the time when these two rings were identified in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in particular , computation of the fundamental class of an algebraic hypersurface @xmath42 in the affine cohomolgy of @xmath38 amounts to computation of the newton polytope of the defining equation of @xmath43 .",
    "[ exafb ] denoting the newton polytope of @xmath35 from example [ exa1 ] by @xmath41 , the fundamental class of the discriminant @xmath7 ( i.e. the newton polygon of this plane curve ) is the fiber polytope of @xmath41 , see @xcite .",
    "as explained above , one can see this equality as the affine version of the plucker formula for degree in the setting of example [ exa1 ] .",
    "recall that minkowski summation of polytopes @xmath44 obviously extends to the notion of riemann integral of a polyhedral - valued function , and the _ fiber polytope _ of @xmath45 in a plane @xmath46 is the riemann integral @xmath47 , where the segment @xmath48 is the projection of @xmath49 along @xmath50 , the volume form @xmath51 on the line @xmath52 is induced by the lattice @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is a polygon - valued function on @xmath55 that sends every @xmath56 to the plane section @xmath57 ( see @xcite for details ) .    more generally , computation of the affine fundamental class of an arbitrary subvariety @xmath42 in the affine cohomolgy of @xmath38 amounts to computation of the _ tropical fan _ of @xmath43 ( see @xcite and @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , we prefer to think here in terms of affine cohomology classes , because some of our constructions and reasonings work well in the context of arbitrary spherical spaces , to which the notion of tropical fan has not been generalized so far .",
    "the setting in example [ exa1 ] admits many variations : we can consider more complicated @xmath58 , increase the dimensions of the complex tori , replace the projection of tori with a generic polynomial map , look for the fundamental classes of more complicated singularity strata and so on .",

    "solves problem [ prb1 ] for the universal codimension 1 stratum : it describes the newton polytope of the @xmath59-discriminant .",
    "although this newton polytope has been extensively studied ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , etc . ) , even in this special case our approach yields something new : corollary [ newtdiscr ] is a positive formula for the newton polytope of the @xmath59-discriminant , different from the known one @xcite and sufficient to classify non dual defective toric varieties .",
    "recall that a projective variety is called dual defective , if its projectively dual variety is not a hypersurface .",
    "classification of dual defective varieties is a classical problem , and even the toric case remains unsolved ( smooth dual defective toric varieties are classified in @xcite , see also @xcite and @xcite for further results ) .",

    "( corollary [ newtdiscr].2 ) an @xmath59-toric variety is not dual defective if and only if , up to a translation , @xmath59 contains an iterated circuit .",
    "problem [ prb1 ] for the universal codimension 2 strata @xmath8 and @xmath26 is solved by theorems [ th1 ] , [ th2 ] and [ th3 ] , which generalize the three equations from example [ exa1 ] .",
    "the answer is illustrated for a particular simple @xmath75 in section [ sexample ] , see also @xcite for another example .",
    "in particular , this allows the description of the newton polytope of the hypersurface @xmath76 of all polynomials @xmath77 that are not morse functions ( i.e. have two equal critical values or a degenerate critical value ) , see section [ sred ] . at the level of degrees ( i.e. when @xmath78standard simplex@xmath79 , and we are computing the degrees of the sets @xmath8 , @xmath26 and @xmath43 in terms of @xmath16 ) , these problems were solved in @xcite and @xcite ( for @xmath80 ) respectively .",
    "multisingularity theory is based on characteristic classes , and the proof of the aformentioned results will be based on _ affine characteristic classes _ of subvarieties of a complex torus , taking values in the affine cohomology ring @xmath39 .",

    "see the original papers @xcite and @xcite and e.g. a survey @xcite for the background on schwarz - macpherson classes .",

    "this class inherits nice functorial properties of the schwarz - macpherson classes : e.g. @xmath84+[u\\cup v]=[u]+[v]$ ] and @xmath85=[u][v]$ ] for a generic @xmath86 . denoting the codimension @xmath87 component of @xmath83 $ ] by @xmath83_i$ ]",

    "the formal rational function @xmath89 of the newton polytopes of the polynomials @xmath90 , which was considered in @xcite and in subsequent literature in relation to the nondegenerate complete intersection @xmath91 in a complex torus , turns out to equal the affine characteristic class of this complete intersection ( when evaluated in the affine cohomology ring ) , see examples [ trophyp ] and [ kbkex ] for more details .",
    "affine characteristic classes seem to be indispensable in solving problem [ prb1 ] , because they appear of their own accord even in the answer for the universal strata @xmath8 and @xmath26 of codimension 2 .",
    "more specifically , the answer given by theorems [ th1 ] , [ th2 ] and [ th3 ] is a system of three independent linear equations on the fundamental classes of @xmath8 and @xmath26 and one more unknown class , which turns out to be the second affine characteristic class of the discriminant @xmath7 .",
    "note the similarity to example [ exa1 ] , where the third unknown @xmath92 can also be interpreted as the second affine characteristic class of the discriminant .",
    "note that , in theorem [ th00 ] , we take the schwarz - macpherson classes of @xmath0 itself , and not the closure of @xmath0 in @xmath82 .",
    "the statement of the theorem obviously generalizes to an arbitrary spherical homogeneous space , however i have no constructive proof in this case . for the toric case ,",
    "the proof occupies section [ sconstr1 ] and is indirect : firstly , affine characteristic classes are constructed in a different way and shown to have functorial properties , similar to schwarz - macpherson classes .",
    "secondly , these properties are shown to imply that the restriction of the affine characteristic class to the cohomology ring of a sufficiently rich compactification equals the schwarz - macpherson class .",
    "the classical approach to enumerative geometry is through intersection theory , characteristic classes and thom polynomials .",
    "answers to enumerative questions can usually be given by certain thom - like polynomials , see e.g. @xcite and @xcite for the problem of counting rational curves passing through given generic points of a given surface .",
    "in the last decade , a fundamentally new class of enumerative results was invented by mikhalkin in @xcite .",
    "results of this type are seemingly unrelated to the aforementioned classical approach to enumerative geometry , and are referred to as tropical correspondence theorems . such theorems state that the answers to certain enumerative questions coincide over @xmath93 and over the tropical semifield @xmath94 .",
    "since enumerative geometry over @xmath95 is combinatorics , this gives a new combinatorial answer to classical problems of enumerative geometry over @xmath93 .",
    "proofs of tropical correspondence theorems usually rely upon some kind of deformation theory technique .",
    "every such proof , besides establishing the desired equality between the number of complex and tropical objects , implicitly contains an algorithm of how to reconstruct the whole 1-parametric family of complex objects being deformed to a given tropical one .",
    "e. g. for a given 1-parametric family of points @xmath96 in the projective plane and a given rational tropical curve @xmath97 , passing through the points of the tropicalization of @xmath96 , the deformation - theoretic proof of mikhalkin s correspondence theorem ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) provides an algorithm of how to compute ( up to an arbitrary power of @xmath56 ) the 1-parametric family of rational curves , passing through @xmath96 and tending to @xmath97 .",
    "one might hope that another approach to the proof , which does not inevitably provide such excessive information , would appear to be more universally applicable .",
    "one such intersection theoretic approach was recently developed in @xcite and references therein .",
    "it is oriented towards enumeration of rational curves .",
    "we suggest yet another approach , oriented towards curves and hypersurfaces , given by implicit equations .",
    "it turns out that once we know the fundamental class of a universal @xmath49-multisingularity stratum in the affine cohomology , we can obtain tropical correspondence theorems for hypersurfaces with multisingularity @xmath49 and various incidence conditions .",
    "so tropical enumeration can be regarded as the classical approach to enumerative geometry , in which the cohomology , the characteristic classes and the thom polynomials are replaced by their affine versions .",
    "this is because the affine fundamental class of a subvariety of a torus is encoded by its _",
    "( @xcite and @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
