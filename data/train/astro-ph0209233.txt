    "er uma stars are a still enigmatic small subgroup of su uma - type dwarf novae [ for a review of dwarf novae , see @xcite ] , which have extremely short supercycle lengths ( @xmath0 the interval between successive superoutbursts ) of 1950 d [ for a review , see @xcite ] and regular occurrence of superoutbursts .",
    "only five definite members have been recognized up to now : er uma ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) ; v1159 ori ( @xcite , @xcite ) ; rz lmi ( @xcite , @xcite ) ; di uma ( @xcite ) ; and ix dra ( @xcite ) .",

    "er uma stars have been understood as a smooth extension of normal su uma - type dwarf nova toward higher mass - transfer rates ( @xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "the exact origin of such a high mass - transfer rate is still a mystery . even considering a higher mass - transfer rate , the shortest period systems ( rz lmi and di uma ) are difficult to explain without a special mechanism of prematurely quenching a superoutburst @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", there have been an alternative attempt to explain the er uma - type phenomenon .",
    "@xcite tried to explain the er uma - type phenomenon by considering a decoupling between the thermal and tidal instabilities [ see @xcite for details of the thermal - tidal instability model ] under extremely small binary mass - ratio ( @xmath2=@xmath3/@xmath4 ) conditions .",
    "@xcite speculated that repeated post - superoutburst rebrightenings in wz sge - type dwarf novae ( hereafter wz sge stars ) or large - amplitude su uma - type dwarf novae ( e.g. @xcite ; see @xcite for a recent observational review of wz sge - type stars ) .",
    "@xcite tried to explain er uma - type phenomenon by ( rather arbitrary ) introducing an inner truncation of the accretion disk and irradiation on the secondary star on a numerical model developed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite further tried to explain the unification idea by @xcite using the same scheme as in @xcite .",
    "although the results partly reproduced the characteristics of er uma stars and wz sge stars , they failed to quantitatively reproduce the light curves of these dwarf novae .    from the observational side , the existence of a gap between distributions of er uma stars and  usual \" su uma - type dwarf novae has been a challenge . the shortest known @xmath0 in usual su uma - type dwarf novae",
    "had been 130 d ( yz cnc , see also table 1 in @xcite ) at the time of the initial proposition of er uma stars . although further works have slightly shortened this minimum @xmath0 [ ss umi : 84.7 d , @xcite ; bf ara : 83.4 d , @xcite ] , there still remains a undisputed gap .",
    "in addition to these usual su uma - type dwarf novae with the shortest @xmath0 s , there exists a seemingly different population of su uma - type dwarf novae with short @xmath0 s , but with infrequent normal outbursts .",
    "v503 cyg [ @xmath0 = 89 d , only a few normal outbursts in a supercycle @xcite ] and ci uma [ @xmath5 140 d , infrequent normal outbursts @xcite ; @xmath0 variable ?",

    "we examined the observations of v503 cyg posted to vsnet collaboration , http://www.kusastro.kyoto - u.ac.jp / vsnet/@xmath6 . ] and found an appreciable change of the outburst properties .",
    "the observations used @xmath7-band comparison stars , and typical errors of individual estimates are smaller than 0.3 mag , which will not affect the following discussion .",
    "the object has been well sampled by many observers around the world except for periods of solar conjunctions .",
    "table [ tab : burst ] lists the observed outbursts since 1997 .",
    "the outburst lengths listed in the table approximately correspond to the durations above @xmath8 15.5 .",
    "although occasional observational gaps introduced an uncertainty of a few days , most of these superoutbursts were well recorded .",
    "many of normal outbursts during the favorably observed seasons were recorded , although some outbursts must have been missed . in order to estimate the numbers of missed outbursts , we performed monte - carlo simulations .",
    "the fractions of missing simulated 1000 normal outbursts ( the maximum magnitude and the rate of decline have been adjusted to those of actual outbursts ) were 10% , 18% and 30% for the three representative epochs shown in figure",
