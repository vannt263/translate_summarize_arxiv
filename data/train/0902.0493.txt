    "low - frequency radio astronomy is currently experiencing an impressive revival with a number major new facilities in operation or under construction , such as the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt , * ? ? ? * ) , low - frequency array ( lofar , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , long - wavelength array ( lwa , * ? ? ? * ) , murchison widefield array ( mwa , formerly known as the mileura widefield array , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , the 21 centimeter array ( 21cma ; formerly called _ primeval structure telescope _ , past , * ? ? ? * ) , and precision array to probe the epoch of reionization ( paper , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "eventually the square - kilometre array ( ska , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may extend the expected collecting area even further .",
    "main science drivers of these telescopes are the so - called epoch of ionization ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , large scale surveys , transient and variable source monitoring @xcite , observations of our own sun @xcite and solar system @xcite , as well as exoplanets @xcite and astroparticle physics @xcite .",
    "this rapid development together with the lively discussion of a possible return to the lunar surface by various space agencies , has raised again the long - standing question about the potential of low - frequency astronomy from space ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the currently planned ground - based telescopes will provide a serious advance in radio astronomy and extend the accessible frequencies to the widest range possible from the ground .",
    "the earth s turbulent ionosphere gives rise to `` radio seeing '' , making ground - based radio observations of the sky become difficult at @xmath7mhz . at even longer wavelengths below about 10 - 30 mhz",
    "one encounters the ionospheric cut - off where radio waves are reflected , permitting long - distance short wave transmission around the earth , but prohibiting observations of the sky . observing just above the cut - off , i.e. , between @xmath51050 mhz requires especially favourable geomagnetic and ionospheric conditions to obtain any decent images .",
    "the range below the cutoff is only readily observable from space .",
    "hence , the dominant `` low - frequency / long - wavelength '' regime for which ground - based telescopes are being designed is at frequencies @xmath8mhz and wavelengths @xmath9 m .",
    "we will therefore hereafter refer to wavelengths above 10 m as the ultra - long wavelength ( ulw ) range .",
    "this wavelength - based definition is preferable to a frequency - based one to avoid confusion with the technical very low frequency ( vlf ) designation that extends only from 3 - 30 khz ; the range 300 khz-30 mhz is in engineering language named the medium and high frequency regime ( mf & hf ) , which is clearly not appropriate in a modern astronomical context .",
    "the best resolution achieved so far in the ulw range is on the scale of around 5 degrees , but more typically of order tens of degrees .",
    "this compares rather unfavourably to the milli - arcsecond resolution that can be routinely obtained in very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) at higher radio frequencies .",
    "hence , the low - frequency universe is the worst - charted part of the radio spectrum , and perhaps even of the entire electromagnetic spectrum . by today",
    ", only two kinds of maps of the sky have been made at frequencies below 30 mhz .",
    "the first are maps of a part of the southern sky near the galactic center such as those obtained by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite from tasmania .",
    "these have angular resolutions ranging from 5 to 30 degrees .",
    "the second kind are the maps obtained by the rae-2 satellite @xcite with angular resolution of 30 degrees or worse .",
    "none of these maps show individual sources other than diffusive synchrotron emission of the galaxy , nor do they cover the entire sky .",
    "to improve this situation and to overcome these limitations , space - based low - frequency telescopes are required for all observations below the ionospheric cutoff @xcite .",
    "this is also true for a significant part of the seeing - affected frequency range above the cutoff frequency where high - resolution and high - dynamic range observations are required , such as imaging of 21-cm emission of neutral hydrogen in the very early universe @xcite .",
    "so far , there have only been two space missions whose primary purpose was low - frequency radio astronomy : the radio astronomy explorers ( rae ) 1 and 2 .",
    "the design and results of these missions have been reviewed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite summarized the science goals of the rae missions as four - fold , namely characterizing the spatial and spectral structure of galactic radio emission , observing bursts from the sun and jupiter , and attempting to detect discrete galactic and extragalactic sources .",
    "it was a surprising finding of rae-1 that the earth itself is a strong emitter of low - frequency bursts , the so - called auroral kilometric radiation ( akr ) generated by solar - wind interactions with the earth s magnetic field .",
    "this emission is so strong that rae-2 was placed in a lunar instead of the originally planned terrestrial orbit to provide shielding from this natural terrestrial interference ( fig .",
    "[ f : rae2shield ] and  [ s : constr.int ] ) . of the original science goals",
    ", only the solar and jupiter burst studies could be completed ; in addition , terrestrial bursts were studied .",
    "the structure of the galaxy s emission was only seen at very low spatial resolution ( with beam sizes between @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) and fairly low signal - to - noise ratio . due to the very limited angular resolution and the large power of akr ,",
    "it proved impossible to image any discrete sources directly . thus , two of the initial scientific questions of the rae missions remain unanswered to date .",
    "low - frequency radio imaging telescopes at these frequencies are nowadays realized as digitally phased arrays of thousands of simple dipole antennas that are spread over a large area .",
    "this puts a serious constraint on any realization consisting of free - flying antennas in space and very likely favours lunar surface - based concepts in the long term .",
    "moreover the moon provides unique shielding against disturbing radio interference from sun and earth and within the exploration efforts of space agencies lunar missions appear to be a realistic possibility .",
    "hence we will focus here on a lunar surface telescope concept consisting of dipoles as the most basic antenna unit .",
    "nonetheless , most of our conclusions are general enough that they can be of use also for other kinds of implementations .    over the past four decades",
    "several conferences and study groups formed by space agencies have produced reports on lunar radio astronomy @xcite .",
    "starting from these earlier studies we will here summarize the prospects and fundamental limitations of ulw observations and discuss their scientific potential in light of our current knowledge .",
    "recent scientific advances in many areas and in particular in cosmology lets low - frequency astronomy shine in a new light and makes this a timely topic .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "we describe observability constraints for ulw observations from the earth and the moon in  [ s : constr ] , including a description of the galactic foreground emission , and formulae for the estimation of array sizes , sensitivities etc .",
    "we give science questions to be addressed by a lunar low - frequency array in ",
    "[ s : scidrv ] and summarize our findings in ",
    "[ s : summary ] .",
    "radio waves are scattered by free electrons , such as those occurring in a space plasma or the earth s ionosphere .",
    "the scattering strength increases towards lower frequencies . at frequencies below the plasma frequency , which increases with electron density",
    ", radio waves can not propagate at all .",
    "the plasma frequency of the earth s ionosphere is typically near 10  mhz by day and near 5  mhz by night , implying that radio observations near and below these frequencies are impossible from the earth ( the plasma frequencies can reach somewhat lower values near the earth s magnetic poles ) . at frequencies up to a few 100 mhz ,",
    "the ionosphere causes celestial radio sources to suffer significantly from angular displacements , angular broadening , and intensity fluctuations ( scintillation ) .",
    "these features are akin to _ seeing _ , the twinkling of stars visible to the eye , which is caused by density fluctuations of turbulence layers in the earth s atmosphere .",
    "because of the scattering , the best available ground - based maps of the low - frequency sky have resolutions ranging from 30 degrees at 2.1  mhz to 5 degrees at 10  mhz @xcite and very poor dynamic range .",
    "even though the moon does not have a gaseous atmosphere , instruments carried by the apollo  14 and luna  19 and 22 missions showed that the moon s surface has a photoelectron sheath , i.e. , a weak ionosphere . on the day side ,",
    "the inferred electron densities lay in the range 50010,000@xmath12@xmath13 , with plasma frequencies between 0.2 and 1 mhz ( see * ? ? ? * , and references therein ) . electron densities on the night side are expected to be much lower , since the moon s surface potential becomes negative .",
    "however , the electron density has not been mapped yet in detail as function of lunar position and altitude above the surface .",
    "this is clearly a necessity , given that electron densities at the high end of the inferred ranges would mean that a lunar observatory only gains a factor of 10 in frequency during lunar day compared to what is observable below the earth s ionosphere .",
    "the current generation of moon missions , in particular the japanese kaguya / selene mission , should clarify this issue .",
    "secondly , low - frequency radio waves can propagate into the lunar regolith to depths of 1 - 100 wavelengths .",
    "subsurface discontinuities in the electrical properties of the lunar regolith could therefore lead to reflections and hence stray signals being scattered into the beam of lunar antennas .",
    "thus , the subsurface electrical properties of the prospective sites for a lunar radio telescope need to be explored before construction of a very large array ( compare * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the low - frequency radio spectrum is occupied to a large fraction by terrestrial broadcasts , in particular fm and longer - wave radio and television broadcasts and military and civil communications .",
    "this radio frequency interference ( rfi ) is a severe problem for all kinds of ground - based radio telescopes .",
    "these signals block out cosmic signals directly at the corresponding wavelengths , but they also lead to an increased noise level for observations at other frequencies through intermodulation products in the receiving system , through leakage , or if the affected frequencies are not filtered out completely .    at the longest wavelengths ,",
    "these signals are reflected by the ionosphere .",
    "this is of course the very reason why these wavelengths are used for world - wide radio broadcasts , but it also means that a terrestrial ulw radio telescope is sensitive not just to local interference , but also to interference from all parts of the world , irrespective of location .",
    "when the first dedicated radio astronomy satellite , rae-1 , was designed , it was expected that placing the satellite in a low orbit above the ionosphere would lead to a sufficient suppression of interference .",
    "however , it turned out that there were very strong radio bursts from the earth itself , generated by the interaction between solar - wind particles and the earth s magnetic field , in particular in the frequency range 150 - 300 khz . at higher frequencies , man - made and lightning interference",
    "are also still detectable above the ionosphere .",
    "therefore , the second mission , rae-2 , was redesigned and this satellite was put into an orbit around the moon . figure [ f : rae2shield ] shows how well terrestrial radio interference is shielded by the moon .",
    "naturally , also the sun and jupiter are strong sources of ulw radio emission - especially during outbursts - and again here the moon can act as a perfect shield for a large fraction of the time .",
    "shielding of terrestrial radio interference by malapert mountain , whose peak is at @xmath14 km from the south pole .",
    "this shielding is in addition to the 2030db attenuation applying to all interference in the south polar region .",
    "taken from ( * ? ? ?",
    "4.9 ) with kind permission of the author.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    @xcite has modelled the reflection and absorption of low - frequency radio waves by the moon , including the shielding by mountains .",
    "he finds that a large fraction of the incident energy is reflected by the lunar surface ( 55% at 0.5mhz ) , and an effective skin depth of @xmath15 .",
    "thus , at 0.5mhz , shielding is already substantial at a depth of a few kilometers and becomes better at higher frequencies .",
    "figure  [ f : takahashi_malapert ] shows the attenuation along a line joining the lunar south pole ( a possible location for a future lunar base ) and the nearby malapert mountain ; malapert may provide up to 70db ( a factor of @xmath16 ) of shielding at 0.5mhz , while the simulations indicate a shielding by a factor of at least @xmath17 at all frequencies above 10khz for the lunar far side , i.e. , substantially stronger shielding .",
    "a fundamental constraint for all very low - frequency radio astronomy is the presence of free electrons in the interplanetary medium ( ipm ) within the solar system , the solar wind , and in the interstellar medium ( ism ) filling our galaxy .",
    "the plasma frequency of the ipm depends on the distance from the sun and the solar cycle ; at the earth , it lies in the range 20 - 30  khz , and the scaling is roughly linear with sun - earth distance .",
    "observations outside the solar system are restricted to higher frequencies .",
    "the ism plasma frequency is of order 2  khz for the average electron density in the galactic plane of 0.025@xmath18 @xcite and therefore poses no additional constraints beyond those imposed by the ipm .",
    "the ism plasma frequency is significantly lower than the ionospheric plasma frequency and hence there is still a wide range of accessible parameter space to be explored .",
    "however , in addition to inhibiting the propagation of electromagnetic waves below the plasma frequency , there are several more consequences of the presence of free electrons : foreground emission , free - free absorption , and scattering of waves in turbulent regions . as usual",
    "all these effects can be a curse , when studying extragalactic sources , and a blessing , when studying the local ism .",
    "moreover , there are fundamental constraints to observations of the radio sky with interferometers , which arise from the need to match the resolution to the density of sources at the instrument s sensitivity to avoid confusion .",
    "we consider each of these effects in turn .",
    "spectrum of galactic synchrotron emission , showing specific intensity ( solid line ) and surface brightness temperature ( dashed line ) .",
    "the surface brightness temperature dominates the system temperature at the frequencies shown .",
    "figure taken from @xcite with kind permission of the authors.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    synchrotron emission from electrons moving in the galactic magnetic field constitutes the dominant foreground ( an overview about observations of the galactic emission that have been made to date is given by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the distributions of electrons and magnetic fields are not yet known in full detail and subject of active study .",
    "the component of the ism that contains the free electrons responsible for the scattering is called the warm ionized medium ( wim ) .",
    "it broadly follows the distribution of gas in the galaxy , i.e. , it is concentrated in the plane of the galaxy .",
    "the brightness temperature of the emission rises from about @xmath19k at 30  mhz to about @xmath20k at around 1  mhz , and then increases less rapidly ( and the specific intensity decreases ) because free electrons absorb low - frequency radiation via free - free absorption ( see figure  [ f : galbg ] and following section ) . for reference , the conversion between flux density ( jansky , jy ) ] and brightness temperature ( in kelvin , k )",
    "is given by @xmath21 and hence we have for an extended source @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the surface brightness , @xmath24 is the surface brightness temperature , @xmath25 is the flux density , @xmath26 is the source s solid angle , and @xmath27 is the boltzmann constant @xmath28j / k .    because of the absorption",
    ", the surface brightness distribution of the galaxy varies with frequency : at high frequencies , the galactic plane is seen in emission , with hii regions being superimposed in absorption , while the poles are more or less transparent ; at frequencies around 2 - 3  mhz , the surface brightness is constant in all directions , so that the sky appears equally foggy everywhere ; at lower frequencies , the plane is seen in absorption , so that the poles will appear warmer than the plane .",
    "the main effect of the galactic synchrotron emission at low frequencies is that the sky temperature is so high that it dominates the system temperature and therefore limits the sensitivity .",
    "figure [ f : sensnant ] shows the expected sensitivity for a lunar array as function of the number of crossed dipoles , each with effective area @xmath29 where effective area is related to primary beam size @xmath26 , which is also the size of the antenna s field of view , by @xmath30 we use the rms sensitivity ( @xmath31 ) of an array of antennas ( * ? ? ?",

    "there is a fundamental maximum to the useful number of dipoles within a given area : an array with resolution @xmath46 arcminutes can have at most @xmath47 dipoles before the filling factor exceeds unity , i.e. , the dipoles start becoming mutually coupled ; the maximum baseline necessary to reach this resolution is given by @xmath48 we consider a related issue in ",
    "[ s : constr.conf ] below : the maximum number of useful antennas before confusion noise ( rather than random noise ) limits the array performance .",
    "the magnitude of the free - free ( or thermal bremsstrahlung ) absorption coefficient @xmath49 depends on both electron density and temperature as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the density in @xmath18 and @xmath52 the temperature in @xmath53 of the electron distribution , @xmath54 is the observing frequency in hz , and @xmath55 is the free - free gaunt factor @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "for the parameters of the interstellar medium @xmath57@xmath18 and @xmath58k @xcite , the distance at which the ism optical density satisfies @xmath59 is about 1.5kiloparsec ( kpc ) at 1  mhz ; this distance scales as the square of the frequency .",
    "for comparison , the thickness of the galactic disc , in which the free electrons are found , is about 1  kpc , and the diameter of this disc is about 25  kpc .",
    "thus , extragalactic observations are impossible below about3 mhz unless there are low - density patches .",
    "indeed , the galactic synchrotron spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ f : galbg ] ) turns over at frequencies near 3mhz due to absorption ( this turnover is one of the ways in which the galactic electron density and temperature are constrained observationally ) .",
    "variations of the electron temperature and density in the ism will already cause difficulties in interpreting data in the range 3 - 7  mhz , since variations in the surface brightness arising from fluctuations in the foreground emission and absorption have to be disentangled from structures in the sources .",
    "for some kinds of sources , this may be done by comparing the source spectra as well as their morphology , but for extragalactic synchrotron sources with similar spectra to the galactic synchrotron emission , this task will be considerably more difficult the more extended they are .",
    "on the other hand , the absorption enables a tomography of the ism , since observing at different frequencies picks out absorbing structures at different distances .",
    "this is described in section  [ s : scidrv.galaxy.ism ] .      below about 100 mhz ,",
    "the brightness temperature of the galactic emission is much higher than that of any noise source in the telescope itself and therefore sets the system temperature , @xmath39 . because of the structure of galactic emission and absorption",
    ", @xmath39 at any given frequency will vary strongly with direction ( for example , below 30  mhz , hii regions will be seen in absorption against the galactic plane ) .",
    "@xcite noted that this can lead to dynamic range and calibration problems already when observing with the vla s steerable antennas at 74  mhz ; these difficulties are likely to be exacerbated by the use of lower - frequency dipoles with larger primary beams",
    ". the operation of lofar will provide experience and expertise in the calibration of an interferometer in the presence of strongly variable backgrounds .",
    "for some applications a dynamic range of @xmath60 is sought .",
    "since the field of view of dipole antennas is practically the entire sky , the necessary dynamic range can be estimated by comparing the flux densities of the brightest radio sources in the sky , the supernova remnant cas  a ( diameter @xmath61 , flux density 65kjy ) and the radio galaxy cyg  a ( diameter @xmath62 , flux density 31.7kjy ; both flux densities are taken from tab .  2 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to the desired flux limit . for extragalactic sources ,",
    "the latter is the confusion limit ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : conflim ] below ) . at 15mhz and with a resolution of 2@xmath63 , for example",
    ", the confusion limit is 0.14jy , requiring a dynamic range of @xmath64 to image sources at the confusion limit against the glare of cyg  a.      like all solar - system planets , the earth is embedded in the interplanetary medium ( ipm ) : the solar wind , an extension of the solar corona .",
    "the properties of the solar wind vary with the 11-year solar activity cycle .",
    "the solar system itself is embedded in the ism , as already discussed above .",
    "electron density fluctuations both in the ism and the ipm cause scattering of radio waves , leading to the phenomena of diffractive and refractive scintillation , scatter broadening , temporal broadening of pulses , and faraday depolarization of linearly polarized sources .",
    "the angular scattering and scintillation are akin to `` seeing '' .",
    "this is the blurring of optical images in ground - based telescopes caused by density fluctuations in turbulent layers of the earth s atmosphere and the main motivation for optical space telescopes and adaptive optics .      at frequencies below 30 mhz ,",
    "the scattering is in the `` strong '' regime for both media @xcite , which means that there are no intensity scintillations , and the scattering broadens the intrinsic source size into a scattering angle that scales roughly as @xmath65 .",
    "there is solar - wind scattering at all elongations from the sun , but the scattering is smallest in the anti - solar direction and increases for lines of sight passing closer to the sun .",
    "similarly , the ism is completely surrounding the earth so that there is some scattering in all directions , but because of structures in the ism , the scattering is stronger for lines of sight passing through the plane of the galaxy and closer to the galactic centre .",
    "the expected order of magnitude of the scattering for both media can be extrapolated from measurements at higher frequencies .",
    "empirically , the ism broadening of the image of an extragalactic source is roughly given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the galactic latitude @xcite .",
    "estimates of the ipm scattering at 1  mhz range from a factor 3 smaller than the ism scattering @xcite to a factor 5 greater @xcite .",
    "figure  [ f : resblscatt ] shows the achievable resolution with the limits imposed by ipm and ism scattering , as function of array size , using the worst - case ipm scattering given by @xcite : @xmath68 and a slightly different version of eq .",
    "[ eq : theta_ism ] for ism scattering , @xmath69 . the best - case ipm scattering @xcite would be a factor of 15 smaller than given by eq .",

    "the scattering angle is given by @xmath74 , where @xmath75 m is the classical electron radius .",
    "a more realistic model of the ism / ipm accounts for their turbulent nature , yielding the @xmath76 scaling used above .",
    "the strength of the scattering is set by the _ scattering measure _ , a weighted line - of - sight integral of the turbulence power - spectrum coefficients ( see @xcite and @xcite , who also give expressions relating the scattering measure to observables , as well as the emission measure and the pulsar dispersion measure ; @xcite furthermore report a model for the distribution of free electrons in the galaxy and give a computer programme that allows computation of the scattering measure , angular broadening , etc . ) .",
    "together with angular broadening , electron density fluctuations due to ism and ipm turbulence also cause temporal broadening of radio pulses .",
    "the temporal broadening arises because the angular broadening allows the emission to reach the observer via multiple optical paths with different lengths .",
    "the magnitude of temporal broadening @xmath77 is just the geometric delay between the scattered and unscattered signal paths and therefore related to the magnitude of angular broadening @xmath78 by @xmath79 in a small - angle approximation . here",

    "@xmath84 so that @xmath85",
    ". @xcite gives the following rough scalings for temporal broadening : @xmath86 with these scaling laws , the ipm temporal broadening is acceptable at least down to 1  mhz , but the ism broadening is still 2 hours at 10  mhz , implying that no high - time resolution work can be done for sources at extragalactic distances . for sources within the galaxy ,",

    "however , there are now indications that the pulse broadening may increase less rapidly with wavelength than expected from eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau_ism ] ) ; this might allow the detection of ulw pulses also from extragalactic sources after all .",
    "the plane of polarization of a linearly polarized beam undergoes the so - called faraday rotation when it propagates through a region containing both free electrons and a magnetic field component parallel to the direction of propagation .",
    "faraday rotation can be corrected using multi - frequency observations and the known frequency dependence of the effect . however , faraday rotation for low - frequency observations is dominated by free electrons from the solar wind in the immediate vicinity of earth .",
    "this makes linear polarization angles difficult to calibrate for all sources @xcite , since the rms rotation angles can be very large and time - variable . on the positive side",
    "this may provide some measure of solar wind activity and distribution .",
    "a much more severe effect is the cellular depolarization arising from multiple uncorrelated faraday rotation events in the ism .",
    "the magnitude of the effect can be found by considering the random walk of the polarization angle in a region with fluctuating electron density and magnetic fields , akin to the random walk of phase in a fluctuating electron density ; assuming a constant magnetic field , the rms phase variation is given by @xcite : @xmath88 where again @xmath71 is the path length through the scattering region , @xmath72 is the size of an electron density fluctuation , @xmath73 is the associated electron overdensity , and @xmath89 the magnetic flux density component along the line of sight ( all in si units ) . by inserting into equation  ( [ eq : faradpsirms ] ) a size @xmath90 parsec for individual turbulent cells of the ism , a typical electron density of @xmath91 , and a typical magnetic field of 0.5nt",
    ", the magnitude of the faraday rotation at 1mhz is about 1 radian in one such cell .",
    "the total rms faraday rotation of low - frequency radiation travelling through the ism is therefore very large , of order 1000 radians per parsec , and therefore leads on average to depolarization .",
    "thus , no linear polarization is observable from sources beyond our own solar system at these very low frequencies .",
    "circular polarization is not affected , but circularly polarized sources are extremely rare at higher frequencies , though cyclotron maser bursts have been observed from certain types of stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is being found in an increasing number of active galactic nuclei ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) . at lower frequencies ,",
    "cyclotron maser bursts are expected to be visible from extrasolar planets ( see  [ s : scidrv.transients.extraplanets ] ) .",
    "also conversion from linear to circular emission in a dense magnetized plasma ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein for an explanation ) is another process that can generate some level of circularly polarized emission across a wide frequency range .",
    "hence , circular polarization capabilities  which can be measured by cross - correlating linearly polarized feeds  should be a more promising polarization signal to look for at low frequencies .",
    "the first low - frequency radio surveys suffered badly from confusion : the presence of unresolved sources with individual flux densities below the detection limit leads to a constant floor in the noise level that is reached after a certain observing time .",
    "this can also lead to source positions being substantially in error ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for low - frequency radio astronomy , a greater level of confusion may arise from fluctuations in the galactic foreground emission rather than the presence of unresolved discrete extragalactic background sources .    among others ,",
    "@xcite have considered the impact of these fluctuations on the observability of the redshifted 21-cm power spectrum at frequencies near 100  mhz .",
    "a detailed simulation of the galactic foreground emission based on an extrapolation of results from wmap and lofar will provide useful guidance on the expected level of foreground fluctuations which need to be removed in order to detect extragalactic sources .",
    "for the case of observing redshifted line emission , spectral information will help in isolating the signal from the foreground , and transient detection will be affected predominantly by the bright foreground emission ; however , the observability of extragalactic continuum sources in the presence of foreground fluctuations needs to be assessed in detail with suitable simulations .",
    "to estimate the confusion limit for extragalactic observations , which can be done down to 3  mhz , we use the approach and formulas of @xcite , who estimates the anticipated confusion limit due to background sources by extrapolating from extragalactic source counts and the observed confusion limit at 74  mhz . as a conservative estimate based on comparing the rms noise level of 74mhz observations in the vla s c and d arrays",

    "the main antenna gain variations are expected to come from temperature fluctuations ( affecting electronics and damping in the wires ) , rain ( changing the electrical properties of ground and wires ) , and wind ( leading to vibrations of the antennas ) . actual variations of prototype hardware in the field at 40 - 80 mhz have been found to be of order 20% @xcite . since neither rain nor wind are to be expected on the moon , temperature variations will be the largest source of gain variations .",
    "lunar surface temperatures can vary from @xmath121c to @xmath122c , well in excess of terrestrial variations .",
    "fortunately this change in temperature happens over the course of a lunar day , i.e. , 4 weeks and should be relatively smooth and predictable over the array . also , there is no variable cloud cover that can lead to random solar irradiation .",
    "the most stable conditions on the moon would be achieved in an eternally dark spot in a polar crater , where one expects very little gain variations at all .",
    "the final source of uncertainty in the overall calibration would be the relative location of the antennas ( if not known from the deployment procedure ) .",
    "however , interferometric self - calibration procedures can solve for antenna positions with high accuracy , especially if the sky is dominated by a single ( known ) point source .",
    "this is the case during jupiter and solar bursts and has been used effectively already to calibrate lofar prototype stations ( such as lopes ; * ? ? ?",
    "hence , in contrast to arrays on earth , calibratability does not seem to be the main driver for design and layout of the array , as long as a proper temperature control of the dipoles is achieved .",
    "this section describes science questions to be addressed by a lunar array .",
    "as far as possible , the science requirements ( resolution , sensitivity ) have been translated into requirements on the array parameters ( maximum baselines , number of antennas ) .",
    "however , there are additional requirements with regards to the two - dimensional distribution of antennas , the properties of the correlator , and the methods used to calibrate the interferometric data and process them into images of the sky .",
    "these have not been considered in detail and are likely to modify some of the array parameters presented here .",
    "some of these additional aspects have been discussed by @xcite and @xcite , and other previous studies for lunar or space - based low - frequency arrays ( see citations at end of section [ s : intro ] ) .",
    "a fundamental question of current cosmological research is on the nature of structure formation in the universe ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : how is the observed distribution of visible matter created from the initial conditions just after the big bang , when matter and radiation were distributed extremely smoothly , with density variations of just one part in 100,000 ?",
    "the cmb radiation was emitted at @xmath123 , about 400,000 years after the big bang , when the universe had cooled off sufficiently for electrons and protons to recombine into neutral hydrogen atoms ( epoch of recombination ) , allowing the background radiation to move freely without being scattered by the electrons and protons . at the same time , however , the universe became opaque to visible light , because neutral hydrogen atoms absorb visible and infrared photons and re - emit them in random directions .",
    "moreover , there were no sources of light in the universe yet : the hydrogen and helium that were created in the big bang first had to cool in order to be able to clump together and form stars and galaxies .",
    "hence , this era is called the `` cosmic dark ages '' in the redshift range @xmath124 @xcite .    things only changed after the first stars , galaxies and active black holes had formed and emitted enough uv and x - ray photons to reionize the neutral hydrogen , allowing all radiation to pass freely .",
    "the time when this happened is called the epoch of reionization ( eor ) and is believed to have occurred around @xmath125 , about 400 million years after the big bang , though it is at present not known whether the reionization happened more or less instantaneously , similar to a global phase transition , or was more or less spread out in time , depending on local conditions .    throughout",
    "all these epochs hydrogen played a major role , emitting or absorbing the well - known 21-cm ( 1.4 ghz ) line due to the spin flip of the electron .",
    "this emission is redshifted by a factor 101000 due to the cosmological expansion and ends up in the frequency range from 1401.4 mhz .",
    "when the hydrogen spin temperature is not coupled perfectly to the radiation temperature of the cosmic background radiation , but changed by other couplings with the surrounding matter and radiation , it can be seen against the cosmic background radiation in absorption or emission , depending on whether the spin temperature is lower or higher than the background radiation temperature . in this way",
    ", the cosmological 21-cm emission carries information about the evolution of the universe .    the exploitation of cosmological 21-cm emission is subject of a rapidly developing literature , which is reviewed by @xcite .",
    "here we highlight the requirements for three applications : detecting the global signal from the epoch of reionization (  [ s : scidrv.cosmo.geor ] ) as well as from the dark ages beyond reionization (  [ s : scidrv.cosmo.globaldark ] ) , 21-cm tomography of the reionization era , (  [ s : scidrv.cosmo.tomo ] ) , and measuring the power spectrum of 21-cm fluctuations (  [ s : scidrv.cosmo.powspec ] ) out to z=50 .",
    "the 21-cm hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen atoms can be used as a cosmological probe because differences between the spin temperature @xmath126 characterizing the population of the upper and lower hyperfine state and the radiation temperature @xmath127 of the background radiation are observable directly : for @xmath128 , the 21-cm emission is seen in absorption , while it is seen in emission for the converse case @xcite .",
    "the spin temperature is determined by the history of collisional and radiative excitation , which in turn is determined by the cosmological evolution of cmb and gas temperatures ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite have simulated the evolution of the sky - averaged brightness temperature of redshifted 21-cm emission due to the onset of reionization , the so - called global eor signal .",
    "the signal is a characteristic variation of 21-cm brightness temperature @xmath129 with redshift , which arises at follows . before reionization ,",
    "the hyperfine populations of neutral hydrogen are in equilibrium with the background radiation , and @xmath130 .",
    "as the first lyman-@xmath131 photons are generated , @xmath126 becomes decoupled from the background radiation temperature and couples to the gas temperature , either by collisions or via wouthuysen - field scattering @xcite .",
    "since the gas temperature is less than the cmb temperature and therefore @xmath132 , the 21-cm line is seen in absorption .",
    "as the gas heats up , @xmath133 increases and reaches values greater than 0 .",
    "the heating increases until reionization has proceeded so far that only very few neutral hydrogen atoms are left , thus removing the source of the 21-cm emission and resetting @xmath134 to its initial value of 0",
    ". the observed wavelength at which this signal appears directly reveals _ when _ reionization occurred , and the redshift evolution of @xmath135 encodes the detailed physics of reionization .",
    "because of the homogeneity and isotropy of the universe , this transition happened roughly simultaneously in all parts of the universe .",
    "therefore , the same signal is observed independently of the direction one is looking in , and a single simple dipole antenna would be sufficient equipment to pick up the signal , which has an amplitude of a few to a few tens of millikelvin ( * ? ? ? * fig .",
    "thus , although simple in principle , detection of the signal is difficult against the galactic foreground .",
    "as reionization is believed to occur in the redshift interval @xmath136 , the signal will appear at frequencies between 70 and 200  mhz .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , the main problem here is not the sensitivity as such .",
    "the sky temperatures in this frequency range are 1002000  k , with lower temperatures at higher frequencies ( eq .  [ eq : tskyapprox ] ) . as fig .",
    "[ f : globaleor ] shows , the necessary observing times to reach 10-@xmath108 detections of a 1  mk signal from @xmath137 with a single dipole are just a few months .",
    "hence , the ability to distinguish the global eor signal from the effect of the foreground variation imposes a further observability constraint .",
    "the evolution of @xmath138 corresponds to a smooth change of the spectral index as function of frequency , which needs to be distinguished from similarly smooth variations in the galactic foreground emission .",
    "its detection is  so far unsuccessfully  being tried from the ground and requires very high gain stability and absence of rfi : the australia telescope national facility has an ongoing development effort `` cosmological reionization experiment '' ( core ) that attempts a global eor measurement @xcite ; @xcite have just reported first results from the edges experiment , determining an upper limit of 250mk to the reionization signal , and stressing the need for systematic errors being limited to less than 3mk .",
    "a single antenna with an instantaneous frequency range 10 - 200 mhz , in an `` eternally dark '' lunar crater at the pole , kept at a stable temperature , and shielded from any solar and terrestrial radiation , would clearly offer the very best set - up for such an experiment .",
    "that would reduce most instrumental and rfi effects to the bare minimum and only leave the cosmic foreground as the main issue . using several independent dipoles , without any beam - forming , would increase sensitivity and reliability against systematic errors even further . with enough signal paths the same antennas",
    "could then also be used in a beam - forming mode .",
    "systematics and cosmic variance could be further checked by using both lunar poles which lets one observe two independent patches of the sky .",
    "a lunar array could also collect the global eor signal simultaneously with other observations by adding signals from different antennas incoherently .",
    "this only requires including a dedicated signal processing chain parallel to the correlator .",
    "together this should deliver an ultra - precise global radio spectrum of the low - frequency sky to identify the brightness temperature change in the the 21  cm line caused by reionization .",
    "this would answer the question : when did the global transition between a predominantly neutral and a predominantly ionized universe happen ?              in the existing literature , the focus for 21-cm cosmology has been put on the global signal from the epoch of reionization on the one hand , and on the power spectrum of 21-cm fluctuations from the eor and higher redshifts on the other ( see following sections ) .",
    "however , there is also a global signature of the dark ages from the spin temperature evolution at redshifts beyond reionization and up to @xmath139 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the expected signal is a surface brightness decrement with a peak amplitude of around 40mk at @xmath140 and approaching 0 at @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",

    ", the final spin temperature may be much higher than the originally predicted diffuse hydrogen temperature , i.e. , the spin temperature is closer to the cmb temperature , decreasing the absorption dip and weakening the absorption signature .    the simulated line detection with gaussian noise in fig .",
    "[ f : darkages - line ] shows that the signal is only @xmath144 of the foreground signal .",
    "moreover , a detection has to rely on the foreground to be a perfect power law .",

    "it is likely that the actual foreground signal will deviate from a simple power - law .",
    "this makes a detection almost impossible if there are spectral foreground fluctuations of the same magnitude as the dark ages signal . nonetheless , further studies need to show on which level spectral foreground fluctuations are actually present . as in the global eor case , the global dark - ages 21-cm signal is isotropic , so that a single ( well - calibrated ) dipole suffices to carry out this measurement and detect the signal from fig .

    ". therefore , observing fluctuations originating from @xmath188 only contributes 10% of the information accessible at z=30 , and observing @xmath189 only contributes an additional 1% compared to @xmath0 .",
    "thus , as far as the number of samples is concerned , the presence of angular broadening in the ism and ipm makes extending this experiment to lower frequencies progressively more inefficient .",
    "however , the detailed strength of the signal as function of redshift can not be predicted in advance , and there may be highly relevant deviations from current theory .",
    "this is particularly important since , as @xcite point out , this phase of the cosmological evolution is a fairly clean laboratory , hardly affected by any dirty astrophysics of the reionization process .",
    "measuring the evolution of structure formation with redshift between @xmath190 may therefore be one of the most intriguing diagnostics of the history of the universe .",

    "there are a number of questions that are currently of particular relevance to which the study of radio galaxies can provide decisive insights .",
    "the low - frequency emission of radio galaxies and quasars is generated predominantly in the `` lobes '' .",
    "these are structures with scales of tens to hundreds of kpc @xcite that are inflated by pairs of relativistic jets emerging from near the accretion disk around a black hole in the nucleus of the host galaxy .",
    "jets and lobes of radio galaxies emit synchrotron radiation , which has the property that the lowest - frequency emission is generated by the lowest - energy electrons .",
    "since electron energy distributions typically are of the form @xmath202 with @xmath203 to yield the observed spectra @xmath105 , low - energy electrons are the most numerous and dominate the power output . on the other hand ,",
    "as discussed below , higher - energy electrons have shorter cooling time scales , leading to a steepening of the radio spectrum  the so - called spectral aging @xcite .",
    "hence , older parts of a source tend to have steeper radio spectra .",
    "low - frequency observations thus probe the oldest structures in a galaxy and can be used to constrain the age of a source .",
    "if a source is sufficiently compact , it can become optically thick to its own synchrotron emission due to synchrotron self - absorption .",
    "this changes the observed spectral energy distribution from the intrinsic optically thin synchrotron spectrum @xmath204 , with @xmath205 as typical value , to @xmath206 , censoring some of the observables by hiding spectral structures and effectively removing access to the low - energy electrons .",
    "the self - absorption limited maximum brightness temperature scales as @xmath207 ( * ? ? ? * eq .  a8 ) .",
    "typical magnetic fields in lobes are estimated to be of the order of a few nanotesla .",
    "lobe surface brightnesses are well below @xmath208k , the maximum allowed by `` inverse - compton cooling catastrophe '' @xcite .",
    "the lobes of radio galaxies are typically not affected by optical - depth effects .",
    "this is , however , not true for the `` hotspots '' , the terminal shock front of powerful jets .",
    "these frequently show a spectral turnover at frequencies below 100 mhz . from the size of a hotspot and the turnover frequency",
    "one can deduce reasonable limits of the magnetic field strength and power of the jet feeding it .",
    "the inflation of lobes by jets means that mechanical work is done on the surroundings of the radio galaxy .",
    "jets and lobes therefore provide a means for a mechanical coupling between accreting black hole at the centre of the radio galaxy and its surroundings . in current models of galaxy and black hole formation and evolution",

    "since observations at lower frequencies include preferentially steeper - spectrum sources , a ulw survey might turn up a large number of high - redshift radio sources . extrapolating ( perhaps optimistically ) from source counts at 74mhz in the vlss ( eq .  [ eq : ncounts10mhz ] ) , our example array from the same section ( 300 elements , 100 km maximum baseline , 10mhz observing frequency )",
    "would thus be able to discover 3 million sources down to the confusion limit of 65mjy at @xmath209 significance over half the sky ( 500000 per steradian ) , which it would be able to survey within roughly two years . for reference",
    ", @xcite found 30 radio galaxies at @xmath210 starting from a sample of @xmath211 ultra - steep spectrum sources .",
    "another , not yet well - explored method to identify active black holes and jets in the early universe could be to look for young jets that are still contained within the just forming galaxy .",
    "they are expected to show up as compact radio sources with synchrotron self - absorption turnover frequencies that are unusually low for their sizes @xcite . in the local universe",
    "these sources are known as compact - steep - spectrum ( css ) and ghz - peaked - spectrum ( gps ) sources @xcite , with turnover frequencies in the range 100 - 1000 mhz . at @xmath212",
    "these would be shifted to 10 - 100 mhz and could be readily identified by an ulw array .",
    "interestingly , the only radio - loud quasar so far identified at @xmath213 may be a css source @xcite .",
    "the number - counts estimate above , of course , includes all kinds of radio sources , so that the 500000 sources per steradian will also include objects from this category and the ones described next .",
    "radio galaxies and other agn are now believed to be normal galaxies in a phase of more or less strong accretion onto their central black hole @xcite .",
    "it is an important question how long this active phase lasts , and on which timescale their activity recurs .    in the so - called `` double - double '' radio galaxies with two or even sets of radio lobes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the recurrence is directly visible . from synchrotron ageing arguments",
    ", the age of the outer set of lobes is inferred to be of the order of several tens of millions of years , while the inner lobes are inferred to have been launched after an interruption of several to several tens of millions of years .",
    "thus , both the duration of an activity phase and the recurrence timescale are likely within an order of magnitude of @xmath214yr .    however , double - double sources are rather rare , perhaps implying that special circumstances might be required for their formation .",
    "other methods are needed to determine the duration of a galaxy s active phase in the general case .",
    "a very direct way of doing so is counting how many `` fossil '' radio galaxies there are , i.e. , those galaxies whose activity phase has switched off recently .",
    "however , the fossil galaxies have been elusive so far , in part because the emitted power of a radio galaxy drops as it grows in linear extent _ even _ for constant jet power @xcite .",
    "this creates a `` youth - redshift degeneracy '' in current flux - limited low - frequency radio surveys : only fairly young radio galaxies ( ages @xmath215@xmath16yr ) are observable at high redshifts ( @xmath216 ) , while at lower redshifts , radio sources are observable in principle up to ages of @xmath17@xmath217yr ( * ? ? ?",
    "because of this degeneracy no strong statements can be made yet about radio source lifetimes based on the study of low - frequency samples .",
    "moreover , the only known radio galaxy relicts have been identified as _ cool holes _ in the x - ray emission of the hot cluster gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , not via direct searches for their radio emission ( see also the following section on galaxy clusters ) .",
    "present observations simply may have been done at frequencies that are too high to detect fossil radio galaxies in high - frequency all - sky surveys .",
    "this is likely to be the case also with the much better sensitivities of the upgraded e - vla and e - merlin arrays .",
    "lower - frequency observations are better suited for detecting relict radio sources directly because they probe electrons with lower energies , which are those with the longest radiative loss times .",
    "this is because of two key properties of synchrotron radiation :    1 .",
    "the frequency at which a relativistic electron of energy @xmath218 in a magnetic field of flux density @xmath219 emits synchrotron radiation scales as @xmath220 i.e. , lower - frequency emission is generated by lower - energy electrons .",
    "the energy loss of a synchrotron - emitting electron scales as @xmath221 i.e. , synchrotron cooling times are inversely proportional to energy .",
    "but it is not only the case that synchrotron cooling times increase with decreasing observing frequency  more strongly yet , there is a _ maximum energy _ that a synchrotron - cooling electron can have after a given time has elapsed since its acceleration _ even if it had been given an infinite amount of energy initially _",
    "@xcite , because eq .  ( [ eq : syndedt ] ) integrates to @xmath222 .    hence , observations at lower frequencies than currently accessible allow fossil radio galaxies to be detected for a longer interval between the switching - off time and the time of observation , with the accessible radio - lobe lifetime increasing roughly inversely proportional to the observing frequency .",
    "low - frequency radio observations may even be the _ only _ possibility for detecting relict radio galaxies .",
    "even the continued non - detection of such fossil galaxies would yield new physical insights , since it would put the strongest constraints on how rapidly radio lobes have to dissipate all of their energy after the central engine ceases to be active .      just like the gas in radio galaxies , the plasma that fills galaxy clusters emits synchrotron radiation , as well as x - rays through inverse - compton scattering .",
    "the origin of the radiating relativistic particles is unknown .",
    "theories for their origin can be constrained by low - frequency observations , analogous to those of radio galaxies .",
    "this will yield important constraints on the formation history of the clusters and of their magnetic fields . @xcite",
    "have shown that the steep spectra of cluster halos mean that observations at lower frequencies are much more likely to detect the cluster halos , specifically for low - mass and high - redshift objects . indeed , @xcite report the detection of diffuse steep - spectrum emission from the cluster abell  521 at 240610mhz that is not detectable at 1.4ghz .",
    "again , we stress that even a fairly moderate array of 300 dipoles and 100 km maximum baseline operating at 10mhz would be able to discover hundreds of thousands of sources in a matter of a few months .    independently of the question of the impact of agn feedback on galaxy evolution discussed in  [ s : scidrv.extragal.edist ] above , the mechanical energy input into the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) from giant radio sources is an important quantity in studying the thermodynamics of galaxy clusters , and in erudating how energy is transported through them in order to establish the observed temperature and entropy profiles .",
    "for example , the detailed x - ray observations of the centaurus and perseus clusters by @xcite show that bubbles blown by the central radio source play an important role . in the case of the perseus cluster",
    ", the x - ray images have revealed sets of `` ghost bubbles '' without detectable high - frequency radio emission , which are identified as relict sources as discussed in the previous section .",
    "these ghost bubbles rise buoyantly in the cluster atmosphere and are therefore part of the energy transport mechanism in clusters . with low - frequency observations",
    ", it may be possible to detect radio emission from known bubbles , or new bubbles in clusters that have not or can not be observed to similar x - ray depth as centaurus and perseus . in either case , low - frequency radio observations would yield the most stringent constraints on the ages of such bubbles .      in this section",
    "we discuss how to infer the structure of the interstellar medium and the origin of cosmic rays through low - frequency observations . beyond these , also",
    "the study of pulsars may benefit from these because a confusion limit of 65mjy at 10mhz with 1@xmath63  resolution would be matched to the flux limit of lofar for the @xmath223 spectrum typical of pulsars .",
    "this implies that pulsars could either be detected directly , or limits can be set on their low - frequency cutoff .",
    "however , the impact of temporal broadening in the ism (  [ s : constr.gal.temporal ] ) on the low - frequency observability of pulsars needs to be assessed in more detail than we can achieve here .",
    "the structure of the ism in general , and of the supernova - inflated `` local bubble '' within which the solar system resides , has been inferred by considering absorption lines in ultraviolet and x - ray spectra of stars and the ism ( * ? ? ?",

    "* e.g. ) and the distribution of pulsar dispersion measures in the sky @xcite .    also low - frequency radio observations have been brought to bear on this problem : @xcite have modeled the clumpiness of the free electron distribution in the _ warm ionized medium _ ( wim ) phase of the ism by matching the expected turnover in the spectrum of the galactic synchrotron emission to that observed by the rae-2 ( see  [ s : intro ] ) and imp-6 @xcite satellites .",
    "their method models the radiative transfer through the wim and requires only knowledge ( or reasonable assumptions ) about the intrinsic , unabsorbed shape of the underlying synchrotron emission spectrum in addition to the observed brightness distribution .",
    "it is applicable over the frequency range where the wim is neither completely transparent nor completely opaque , i.e. , from 0.110mhz according to @xcite .",
    "this modeling can be extended to infer not only the clumpiness of the ism , but also the full three - dimensional structure of the wim .",
    "figure  [ f : ismpathlength ] shows the dependence of the ism `` visibility '' ( distance to the @xmath59 surface ) as function of galactic latitude for different frequencies , and as function of frequency for different wavelengths .",
    "the limiting power - law for the line - of - sight distance as function of frequency ( right - hand panel in fig .",
    "[ f : ismpathlength ] ) is given by the inverse of the free - free - optical depth ( eq .  [ eq : kappa_ff ] ) for the electron density and temperature in the midplane of the galaxy ; for the parameters given in the figure and at wavelengths between 0.1 and 1mhz , we obtain @xmath224 by scanning through these frequencies and modelling the observed emissivity as function of galactic coordinates , the structure of the wim in the solar system s neighbourhood can be determined in 3d .",
    "the requirements on resolution and sensitivity are rather modest : taking 100pc as a typical ism bubble size and 1kpc as a typical distance leads to a degree - scale resolution requirement .",
    "the sensitivity requirement is comparatively modest also , since the ism emission itself sets the background temperature , so that a sensitivity of order of one part in 1000 of the background level is sufficient , i.e. , the requirement is @xmath225k near 1mhz .    around the turnover frequency of 2mhz ,",
    "the sky is uniformly foggy ; below it , the @xmath59 distance scales as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : visibility_ism ] ) . above it ,",
    "the ism becomes transparent at lower and lower angles above the midplane as the frequency is increased , i.e. , the turnover frequency decreases with the angle above the midplane .",
    "around 2.5mhz , the entire galaxy is transparent , while at 0.3mhz , a frequency well above the putative lunar ionosphere , one would see out only to a few tens of parsec , and see the galactic plane in absorption against the brighter wim emission . at these low frequencies ,",
    "the visibility will therefore be set by the actual substructure of the ism ( supernova shells and bubbles ) rather than by the global structure .    on the upside , the short distances out to which we can see at low frequencies",
    "imply the effects of ism angular and temporal broadening are much less severe than for extragalactic observations at higher frequencies .",
    "for example , from the ne2001 model @xcite , the pulse broadening time at 1mhz over a distance of 500pc in the direction of the galactic pole is about 90s , instead of a few days for extragalactic observations at the same frequency .",
    "similarly , the angular scatter broadening is 0.5@xmath63  instead of @xmath226 , affording a linear resolution of 0.1pc at the @xmath59 distance of 500pc ( see fig .",

    "following the overview by @xcite , this section describes an approach for elucidating the origin of cosmic rays , i.e. , relativistic electrons and protons , with the help of a low - frequency radio array .",
    "the essence of the approach suggested by @xcite is to make use of the fact that galactic hii regions are optically thick at frequencies below about 30 mhz .",
    "therefore , radio emission observed towards such hii regions at low frequencies predominantly arises from material along the line of sight to the hii region , i.e. , the synchrotron emission from cosmic - ray electrons . by observing the synchrotron emissivity towards different hii regions at different distances from the earth",
    ", a 3d map of the electron density distribution can be built up . to remove the degeneracy in the synchrotron emissivity between electron density and magnetic field strength ,",
    "the radio data can be compared with gamma - ray observations .",
    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) are known to accelerate high - energy particles through the first - order fermi shock acceleration mechanism .",
    "however , the so - called `` injection problem '' has not been solved , as the fermi mechanism can boost particles which are already mildly relativistic to very high energies , but it can not accelerate thermal particles to relativistic energies .",
    "since the frequency of synchrotron emission scales with the particle energy , low - frequency radio observations can be used to trace the energy distribution of the lowest - energy particles .",
    "this is necessary to constrain theories which attempt to solve the injection problem .",
    "the level of turbulence generated by snrs in the interstellar medium is also relevant to the generation and propagation of cosmic rays . by observing the scatter broadening of extragalactic background sources at various distances from a snr",
    ", the level of turbulence can be probed and mapped in 3d .",
    "however , the resolution required to clearly resolve hii regions and snrs is of order 1@xmath227 , and the required sensitivity is 0.1mjy / square arcsecond .",
    "both are a challenge for a lunar array and may be better done by a ground - based telescope at higher frequencies and resolutions .",
    "transient sources are particularly interesting in astrophysics because they often indicate very high - energy phenomena , e.g. , gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , supernovae and other stellar explosions , outbursts of accreting black holes , neutrons stars and white dwarfs , reconnection events in the solar corona , or the impact of electrons from the solar wind on planetary atmospheres .",
    "other sources show transient activity simply because of rotation , most notably radio pulsars . finally , at low frequencies the possibility for detecting coherent emission processes increases due to the macroscopic wavelengths . to allow the detection of transients ,",
    "high - resolution high - sensitivity observations have to be possible within the timescale of the transient phenomenon .      both the sun and planets produce radio bursts , the sun through magnetic activity in its corona , and the planets and their moons through interaction of charged particles in the solar wind with the planet s or moon s magnetic fields , as is the case for exoplanets ( see section [ s : scidrv.transients.extraplanets ] ) . in the case of the sun ,",
    "the most violent coronal events give rise to coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) , disruptions in the solar wind in which large numbers of charged particles ( i.e. , cosmic rays ) are accelerated .",
    "the magnetic activity and the charged particles can have dramatic effects on the earth and moon , posing a danger to astronauts and electronic equipment outside the earth s atmosphere , or disrupting radio communications .",
    "these effects have been called `` magnetic storms '' , and efforts to predict the strength and timing of cmes impacting on the earth - moon system are known as `` space weather prediction '' .",
    "the cmes themselves are traceable via their low - frequency radio emission as they propagate towards the earth with an array capable of performing imaging at high time resolution .",
    "since the emission frequency is dependent on density and thus radius , observations down to 100  khz would trace emission out to about half an au ( using the density model of * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) .    while the sun is the strongest source of radio emission at high frequencies ( at 100  mhz and above )",
    ", bursts from the magnetized planets , in particular jupiter , can reach a strength comparable to that of the solar bursts or more , i.e. , a few mjy @xcite .",
    "the emission region of jupiter is very small and not resolved on lunar - like baselines ( see * ? ? ?",
    "hence , an imaging application for jupiter radio emission is not a scientific driver for a lunar telescope .",
    "however , since the emission is strong enough , a single broad - band receiver covering frequencies @xmath228 mhz for spectral measurements with high frequency and temporal resolution of solar and jupiter bursts could be envisaged for prototyping and background measurements . for angular discrimination between different burst sources ,",
    "a small interferometer with comparatively modest baselines ( beginning at 500 m for the highest frequency of 30mhz ) would be sufficient . in the long term ,",
    "also interferometry on a moon - earth baseline could be considered to constrain jupiter bursts in new ways .",
    "while jupiter s emission is an additional foreground and interference signal that likely needs to be avoided for high - sensitivity low - frequency observations , it implies that low - frequency radio observations offer the most favourable achievable intensity contrast between an extrasolar planet and its sun , and therefore open up the possibility of a direct detection of extrasolar planets and their magnetosphere .",
    "@xcite has reviewed the radio emission from extrasolar planets and the results of searches to date .",
    "magnetized planets emit bursts of low - frequency radio waves through the cyclotron maser instability ( cmi ) , in which electrons from the stellar wind interact with the planet s magnetic field .",
    "the cmi is 100% circularly polarized , while solar / stellar bursts are usually unpolarized , offering a mechanism of distinguishing between stellar and planetary radiation . without a polarization - sensitive array , planetary and solar bursts would be distinguishable by temporal structures , either within bursts or from modulations on the timescale of the planetary orbit . @xcite",
    "give 15minutes as typical burst duration , while @xcite shows an example of a burst with an overall duration of several hours , with frequency structure down to the millisecond level ( in his nomenclature , only the features on sub - second timescales are called `` bursts '' ) .    since the cmi is only active in the presence of strong magnetic fields , either in the planet or the stellar wind , this mechanism is most suitable for the detection of magnetized jupiter - like planets .",
    "earth - like planets will only give rise to radio bursts if they are embedded in a stellar wind which is itself strongly magnetized .",
    "even if this is a rare situation , the radio emission might be the most readily detectable signal of such planets .",
    "a crucial parameter is of course the rate at which planetary bursts occur , and hence the survey time that needs to be invested in order to obtain a statistically relevant sample of burst observations .",
    "however , very little is known about the likely recurrence rate , which depends on the unknown way in which cmi bursts are triggered .",
    "one possibility is that they have `` light house beams '' similar to pulsars , with intrinsically continuous emission that is confined to a solid angle and bursts being observed when the emission beam sweeps over the telescope ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "another possibility is that cmis are triggered or enhanced by coronal mass ejections ( cmes ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* who give an example of a solar cme enhancing jovian radio emission ) . in this case ,",
    "the relevant timescale is the cme recurrence timescale modified by the probability that a cme in fact interacts with the planet .",
    "based on such considerations , @xcite expect cme rates in excess of the solar value of about 6  cmes / day , in particular for m  dwarfs which are intrinsically more active than solar - type stars .",
    "@xcite add that cmes can lead to an effectively continuous enhancement of planetary radio emission , in particular in young stars with their frequent cmes .    in spite of the current uncertainties about the rate of exoplanetary low - frequency bursts , the possibility of a direct detection of exoplanets via such bursts is an exciting prospect .",
    "being closer to their star than jupiter is to the sun , hot jupiters should show much more intense radio emission than jupiter itself , at least of order @xmath3 times more @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite have computed the expected radio emission for the extrasolar planets known at the time ( mostly hot jupiters ) and found that they should have bursts of flux densities close to 1  mjy at frequencies of several tens of mhz up to a few ghz , while a few lower - mass planets should emit at frequencies around 0.1 - 1mhz and reach tens to hundreds of mjy .",

    "source variability and their galactic nature would help to overcome the confusion limit .",
    "[ p : planetdipoles ] the requirement for the number of dipoles is driven by the need to detect a burst within its duration .",
    "furthermore , there is no need to map the spatial structure of a burst , i.e. the sensitivity requirement is on flux , not surface brightness .",
    "hence , the dipoles can be distributed over baselines that yield arcminute - scale resolution , which is sufficient for establishing positional correspondence to observations at other wavelengths .    before investing in the construction of such an array , it is important to verify that the temporal pulse broadening due to ism turbulence (  [ s : constr.gal.temporal ] ) does not smear out an exoplanetary burst with a duration of @xmath23115 minutes beyond recognition .",

    "although all exoplanets are in the strong scattering regime at frequencies below 30mhz , the angular broadening even at 1mhz reaches at most a few 10s of arcseconds , which is negligible compared to the likely resolution of a lunar array ( compare fig.[f : resblscatt ] ) .",
    "the pulse broadening times at 10mhz are nearly exclusively well below 1ms , and in all cases less than 10ms . at 1mhz ,",

    "fewer than 1/6 of the known planets are at a greater distance than 70pc , and only 5 of the 113 planets considered by @xcite are predicted to emit at frequencies below 1mhz ( @xcite do not report any predictions below 1mhz because they considered only earth - based radio observatories ) . moreover , as noted above , there are indications that the pulse broadening may increase less rapidly with wavelength than expected from eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau_ism ] ) .",
    "but even if that equation holds , fig .",
    "[ f : exoscatt ] shows that angular and pulse broadening by the ism impose no significant constraints on the observability of exoplanetary radio bursts .",
    "ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) are a rare population of elementary particles , likely composed of protons , atomic nuclei , and potentially photons or neutrinos @xcite",
    ". their energies can reach much higher values than those currently achievable in man - made particle accelerators .",
    "the total flux of cosmic rays is about 1 particle m@xmath233 sterad@xmath234 year@xmath234 above a fiducial particle energy of 10@xmath235 ev .",
    "the cumulative flux spectrum drops roughly as @xmath236 with higher energy thresholds , flattening to @xmath237 below the so called `` knee '' in the cosmic ray spectrum at @xmath238 ev @xcite . above the knee , the cosmic ray flux",
    "is roughly given by @xmath239 at the highest energies , the particle spectrum extends up to and perhaps beyond @xmath240ev .",
    "the currently best information on the spectrum is available from the pierre auger observatory @xcite , showing the well - known `` ankle '' around @xmath241 ev and a steepening beyond @xmath242 ev .",
    "the latter is likely due to the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff , a suppression of extragalactic uhecrs due to proton - gamma interactions with the cosmic microwave background .",
    "origin and nature of uhecrs is still largely unknown , but a link with nearby accreting supermassive black holes has been made @xcite .",
    "a major obstacle to understanding these most energetic particles in the universe is their small flux of less than 1 particle per square kilometer per century , requiring large detectors . here",
    "the moon , with its large surface exposed to empty space , can play a significant role as a particle detector target .",
    "uhecrs can be detected through their intense particle cascades which they initiate when encountering a target .",
    "for example , if uhecrs hit the lunar surface a particle shower will pass through the lunar regolith with a speed greatly exceeding the local speed of light ( the refractive index of the lunar regolith is @xmath243 , see @xcite and references therein ) , leading to intense cherenkov light @xcite . due to the finite length of the shower of a few meters",
    ", the emission must be coherent at long radio wavelengths .",
    "the shower will then show up as a coherent ultra - short radio burst on a time scale of @xmath244 , which is tens of nanoseconds up to microseconds in the low - frequency regime ( @xmath245 mhz ) .",
    "hence , cosmic rays will in principle create an impulsive noise background on top of the steady galactic noise , but the emission will in turn also allow one to them in more detail . @xcite and @xcite have shown that the radio emission from such lunar showers is detectable at the very highest energies by a lofar - like telescope even from earth . especially for cosmic rays and neutrinos at energies @xmath246ev ,",
    "well beyond the gzk cut - off , earth - based low - frequency observations of lunar radio bursts generated by interactions within the moon offer a unique possibility to study these elusive particles .",
    "however , interpretation of these results in the end depends on subsurface properties of the moon and shower - development at these high energies ( e.g. , due to the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal effect ) , making in - situ measurements invaluable .",
    "this is impossible on the earth since accelerators can not produce particles at such high energies and the earth s atmosphere prevents uhecrs from directly hitting the surface .",
    "moreover , placing low - frequency antennas on the moon would have several interesting advantages compared to earth - bound radio experiments : first , being 400,000 times closer to the location of the shower ( assuming a fiducial shower distance of 1 km on the moon ) than the earth , would , roughly speaking , increase the sensitivity to cosmic rays and neutrinos by a factor @xmath247 and allow correspondingly lower - energy particles to be detected . secondly , lunar radio pulses observed from the ground get dispersed by free electrons in the earth ionosphere which can be avoided with in - situ measurements .",
    "also , the expected radio - quietness at the lunar surface would greatly aid in solidly detecting these events .    using the equations given by @xcite , we find that a single dipole antenna operating at 100 mhz with 20 mhz bandwidth should be able to detect of order 7 cosmic - ray events per day at @xmath248ev and above at flux densities of 100 mjy , corresponding to signal - to - noise levels of 10 or more , assuming events at a distance of or less 1 km , arriving from a cone of half - opening angle 45@xmath147   ( fig .  [",
    "f : crfluxdens ] ) .",
    "one advantage of placing the radio receivers directly on the moon instead of on the earth is that high - energy events , which are rarer , can be detected over greater distances from the location of the antennas .",
    "therefore , a larger fraction of high - energy events is observed , and the differential energy distribution of the _ observed _ events scales as @xmath249 , even though the _ intrinsic _ distribution scales as @xmath250 ; the difference arises because more energetic events produce quadratically greater fluxes , which are detectable over linearly greater distances , increasing the collecting area quadratically with energy .",
    "thus , a lunar array finds a larger fraction of the rarer high - energy events than an earth - based array .",
    "the total rate of detected events increases logarithmically with energy , up to a maximum given by the largest distance out to which an event s radio pulse is still visible to the antenna(s ) .",
    "the total event count will still be heavily dominated by low - energy events , so that the total number of detected events above some energy is approximately given by the number of events at that energy which occur within the radius for which the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath251 meets the detection threshold .",
    "at least three antennas are necessary to determine the location of a cosmic - ray event by triangulation and hence the original energy of the particle",
    ". an array of three elements will achieve an s / n of about 2.5 times that in fig .",
    "[ f : crfluxdens ] , since the s / n scales as @xmath252 , where @xmath37 is the number of antennas .",
    "the total event rate above some fixed @xmath251 scales as @xmath253)$ ] , because lower minimum energies @xmath254 become accessible and the differential event rate scales as @xmath255 .    if the observing frequency is lowered from 100mhz to 10 mhz , the flux density per event will be much lower , while the sky background is slightly higher , and , of course , the available bandwidth is smaller .",
    "all three effects mean that the s / n for a fixed event energy is smaller at lower observing frequencies . on the other hand ,",
    "the emission is expected to be more isotropic at lower frequencies ; while only events above @xmath240ev would be observable at 10 mhz , _ all _ such events are detectable out to a radius of 5 km by a single dipole , with a rate of one detectable event about every 2 years .",
    "this means that observing cosmic rays is feasible in the ulw region , and an astronomical array of @xmath256 elements with 5 km spacing could detect of order 30 events / year at @xmath257ev .",
    "this is in principle competitive with the largest cosmic ray detectors today .",
    "the arguments used for deriving the radio flux generated by hadronic cosmic - ray events also apply to neutrino interactions , so that the basic array parameters are identical for the detection of both neutrinos and more massive cosmic rays .",
    "the basic difference to the hadronic component of uhecrs is that neutrinos will penetrate deeper into the moon before they interact .",
    "the mean free path is 130 km @xmath258 and hence the radio pulse would come from _ deep below _",
    "the surface . here ,",
    "lower radio frequencies have the additional advantage of penetrating deeper into the moon crust , thereby enlarging the usable detector volume .",
    "@xcite quote an attenuation length of @xmath259 if this scaling continues all the way to 10 mhz , then a single dipole can see a volume of @xmath260 of detector material for neutrino interactions . hence",
    ", a simple radio array could in principle easily cover several tens of cubic kilometers .",
    "this would be more difficult at these wavelengths on earth , due the global short - wave radio interference .",
    "however , neutrino searches have already been proposed and performed over antarctica at higher frequencies @xcite .",
    "therefore , the competitiveness of a lunar array needs to be evaluated more thoroughly .",
    "it may also be that the difference in geometry of the moon and the density of the lunar crust leaves an interesting parameter space open .",
    "these experiments could run in parallel with an imaging array .",
    "they would require an additional signal path with a pulse detection algorithm and a raw time series buffer of several microseconds to milliseconds per antennas .",
    "the trigger event time has to be at the tens of nanosecond level .",
    "unlike for most other applications , the antennas would require a large acceptance in the horizontal planes to detect `` grazing - incidence '' pulses and toward the ground . for simple dipoles without ground plane",
    "an up - down ambiguity remains ; however , bandwidth - limited pulses produced in the near field above the lunar surface appear exceedingly unlikely , so that this up - down ambiguity should not be a concern .",
    "the distinction between neutrinos and protons / nuclei in the cosmic radiation would be made based on the geometry : only neutrinos would come from well below the array .",
    "as a side - effect of a lunar neutrino detector , one could observe the earth as a neutrino source .",
    "the emission is due to the production of atmospheric neutrinos which are generated in particle showers initiated by cosmic rays hitting the earth s atmosphere .",
    "since the terrestrial neutrino flux is well known , one could wonder about using the earth - moon baseline for neutrino oscillation measurements .",
    "finally , we point out the possibility that impulsive radio noise measurements might also be a potential tool to investigate meteoritic impacts on the moon .",
    "such impacts seem to produce optical flashes which are visible even from earth @xcite .",
    "it is not inconceivable to think that such impacts are also accompanied by low - frequency radio emission",
    ". this may be in analogy to strong electromagnetic pulses ( emps ) , known from nuclear explosions , which have already been used to explain radio emission from cosmic rays in the earth s atmosphere @xcite .",
    "one could also imagine an interaction between the explosion and local electrostatic or magnetic field , however , all of this remains speculative at the moment .",
    "at least , radio emission from impacts has already been used by radio experiments in free space , where radio antennas exhibit radio pulses due to high - speed impacts of dust grains .",
    "for example , based on early findings of voyager ii , a radio antenna on the cassini spacecraft was used to measure dust particles from saturn s rings hitting the entire spacecraft @xcite .",
    "the idea here is that the energy of the impact creates an expanding ionized plasma with an ambipolar electric field , which in turns creates a strong voltage pulse on the antenna or spacecraft .",
    "the time scale of the pulse is on the ms scale and hence should be well discernible from cr impacts .",
    "moreover , the frequency spectrum of the radio pulse seems related to the size of the impacting particle .",
    "the radio signals might therefore reveal the size and mass distribution of the particles . however , this effect typically is associated with electrostatic noise generated at or near the antenna itself . in",
    "how far this effect can applied to a lunar antenna remains unclear at present .",
    "in this paper we have summarized some of the main science goals , requirements , and limitations for astronomy at very low radio astronomy frequencies below 100 mhz , i.e. , ultra - long wavelengths ( ulw ) . in this frequency range",
    "the moon , in particular its far side , offers by far the best ( albeit not cheapest ) site for conducting observations . in several cases",
    "a lunar telescope even offers unique insights .",
    "the main limitation for ground - based low - frequency telescopes is degradation of the image quality due to the earth s ionosphere in the 10 - 100 mhz frequency range . at very low frequencies ( @xmath930 mhz ) ,",
    "the ionosphere is even blocking our view of the universe completely .",
    "space and in particular lunar radio arrays are therefore back in the focus . here",
    "we have discussed a number of science areas where this frequency range may be of special interest : cosmology with primordial hi at @xmath212100 , extragalactic surveys of radio galaxies , clusters and galaxies , astroparticle physics of cosmic rays and neutrinos hitting the moon , transient flares from stars and exoplanets , the 3d structure of the local interstellar medium , and solar system objects .",
    "[ cols= \" < ,",
    "< , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     table  [ t : overview ] summarizes the various science goals and requirements .",
    "clearly of greatest interest is the question of the dark ages and hi observations at the highest redshifts .",
    "this would contain a huge amount of original information about the very early universe unaltered by the complicated astrophysical processes associated with cosmic reionization .",
    "for example , a determination of the exact boundaries of the epoch of reionization through its global signal could in principle be achieved with a single antenna in a dark crater near one of the lunar poles .",
    "this would provide almost perfect shielding from any radio interference and temperature ( hence gain ) variations ",
    "ideal conditions for such measurements .",
    "however , this experiment is also being tried from the ground under somewhat less than ideal conditions and the outcome has to be awaited ( e.g. , see the loose upper limit just obtained by @xcite with the edges experiment ) .",
    "the next step up is the measurement of the hi power spectrum above @xmath261 and into the dark ages .",
    "since the hi gas will trace directly the dark matter distribution , this is an excellent way to measure the primordial density fluctuations which led to the formation of large scale structures in the universe .",
    "measuring the baryonic acoustic oscillations ( baos ) also during the dark ages has several advantages , the most important one being the lack of non - linear processes and biases .",
    "non - linear effects , e.g. , the rapid growth of ionization bubbles from the first stars , affect hi measurements during the epoch of reionization , while unknown star formation efficiencies affect measurements at lower redshifts using galaxies .",
    "hence , measurements of baos in the dark ages could tackle , for example , the issue of non - gaussianity in the density fluctuations @xcite .",
    "this is a quantity directly revealing information about the inflationary phase of the universe .",
    "measuring the baos at @xmath197 on a scale of tens of arcminutes requires of order @xmath262 antennas , because the amplitude of baos is at the scale of 10s of microkelvin .",
    "if one tries to push the resolution further down to arcminute scales in order to discriminate between cosmological models as discussed by @xcite , one again requires at least of order @xmath3 antennas at @xmath263 .",
    "this is a somewhat futuristic experiment for a space array .",
    "if this is realized with 5 m crossed dipoles one requires about 1000 km of wires , which corresponds to of order 1 ton of metal for a light weight wire of one gram per meter . while this is not the limiting factor , the power consumption and the electronics",
    "such broad - band low - frequency receivers currently require a power of the order of several watts , bringing the total energy consumption rate up to several 100kw plus a correlator  hence this would require some serious but not completely outrageous lunar infrastructure to be available .",
    "the main obstacle for achieving the same science goal from the ground is the ionospheric seeing  not because of the resolution , but because of calibration problems .",
    "the detection of the hi signal against the enormous sky background requires a perfect removal of all strong confusing sources and their side lobes .",
    "since low - frequency observations are all - sky observations , the confusing sources will be seen through all the different patches of the ionosphere on the sky , making this a calibration problem with many degrees of freedom .",
    "once more , the coming years have to show down to which frequencies ground - based arrays can calibrate out the obstacles imposed by ionosphere , interference , and foreground .",
    "current experiments do not even attempt to push into this high - redshift range , since well - calibrated observations at frequencies @xmath264mhz corresponding to 21-cm emission from @xmath265 seem completely out of the question for ground - based observations .    as the ultimate goal one could imagine an actual imaging experiment of the dark ages , delivering `` all one needs to know '' about the universe .",
    "however , as we have seen here , the required collecting area is several tens of square kilometers to achieve the necessary surface brightness sensitivity with arcminute - scale resolution .",
    "this puts such a project in a very distant future .",
    "apart from the fundamental cosmology science goal , other topics are also of potential interest .",
    "clearly , galactic and extragalactic surveys are needed to shed light on how the universe looks at these wavelengths .",
    "one expects to be particularly sensitive to fossil radio sources in clusters , and to be able to constrain the total energy output of quasars .",
    "as shown by the survey equation ( [ eq : tsurvey ] ) , an extragalactic half - sky survey with arcminute resolution at 10mhz is possible within two years with an array of a few hundred elements and baselines up to 100 km down to a 5 @xmath108 detection of the confusion background",
    ".    a fairly unique science application at low frequencies would be the 3d tomography of the local warm interstellar medium .",
    "since the hot gas in our galaxies starts to become optically thick between 0.1 and 3 mhz , a ulw radio array could see the entire spatial distribution of this gas from the galactic center to the local bubble by simply stepping through all frequencies .",
    "the gas will have imprinted in its structure the recent history of the galaxy and in particular of the solar system environment .",
    "this is of particular interest since the local bubble pressure has a direct effect on the size of the heliosphere and thus on the cosmic ray flux on earth and its related effects on weather and biological mutation rates @xcite .",
    "hence , one might be able to shed some light on the co - evolution of life in the solar system and its interstellar environment . to perform this survey",
    ", a lunar telescope would require several tens to hundred dipoles , several tens of kilometer baselines and a broad frequency coverage down to 0.1 mhz .",
    "that could be an realistic science goal for the first lunar telescope installations .",
    "another new application in ulw astronomy is the search for transient sources .",
    "here very little is known _",
    "a priori_. jupiter is the prime example with its cyclotron maser flares at 10 mhz which are completely invisible at frequencies above 40mhz due to a sharp spectral cutoff , depressing the flux by 5 orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that this could be used for the detection of the magnetospheres of exoplanets @xcite , but will certainly also be of interest to investigate solar flares in nearby stars .",
    "transient detection requires good instantaneous @xmath120  coverage , tens of thousands of dipoles , some spatial resolution ( baselines of 10 - 100 km ) , triggering mechanisms , and buffering electronics .    due to its huge mass and lack of atmosphere ,",
    "the moon is also a unique ultra - high energy cosmic ray detector .",
    "this is currently being used by ground - based experiments which exploit the fact that particle cascades in the lunar regolith should produce strong radio cherenkov emission . at the very highest energies for cosmic rays this promises by far the most effective detection mechanism @xcite .",
    "the main limit at present are systematic uncertainties of lunar properties .",
    "these could be overcome with the help of a relatively small lunar surface radio array which would make in - situ measurements of these cosmic - ray - induced radio flashes .",
    "significant advances might already be possible with a first prototype array of only a few dipoles .",
    "of particular interest is the transparency of the lunar regolith below 10 mhz .",
    "if this continues to increase with decreasing frequency , already a few dipoles could provide an effective neutrino detector volume of many cubic kilometers in the future .",
    "a by - product of such impulsive radio noise measurements could be the measurement and localization of meteoritic impacts on the moon .",
    "it is obvious that a full - blown lunar ulw radio array with thousands of elements can not be the first step .",
    "indeed , there are a number of open questions about observability and design constraints for a moon - based ulw radio telescope , which need to be answered before a design for a lunar array can be contemplated in detail , let alone be finalized :    1 .",
    "what are the properties of the lunar `` ionosphere '' , in particular at the likely sites for a lunar array on the far side and near the poles ? 2 .",
    "what are the subsurface and electrical properties of the moon ? 3 .",
    "how strong is the shielding of terrestrial radio waves the in polar region ? 4 .",

    "[ en : oq.ion ] what is the lowest frequency at which ionospheric fluctuations above a terrestrial observatory can be calibrated sufficiently well to achieve the dynamic range necessary for imaging faint sources ?    some of these questions will be answered by lofar or mwa in the near future , followed later by the ska .",
    "instruments on current - generation lunar orbiters like the on - going japanese kaguya / selene mission will also provide new insights into questions about the electrical properties of the moon",
    ". nevertheless , some questions will remain that will require measurements and prototyping on the moon directly .",
    "the big advantage of the phased dipole array technology is that it is robust , very flexible , and scalable with the number of antennas .",
    "therefore , one can easily define a program with several steps signified by a growing number of antennas .",
    "dipole antennas can in principle be packaged in a small device and therefore could initially piggy - back on other missions for feasibility studies .",
    "the following steps could be envisaged :    1 .   a dedicated pathfinder experiment with a single antenna to * analyze the transmission of the lunar ionosphere *",
    "investigate the surface and subsurface electrical properties of the moon * determine the beam shape and stability of a dipole on the surface * monitor the radio noise environment on the lunar surface * measure the redshift of the global epoch of reionization (  [ s : scidrv.cosmo.geor ] ) 2 .",

    "it could consist of a fixed antenna and one installed on a rover , with the rover operating over several months and slowly moving further away .",
    "the combination of lunar rotation and motion of the rover out to tens of kilometers would provide a decent @xmath120  coverage and allow one to perform an interesting imaging survey already with a small mission .",
    "the realization of these arrays is a matter of current study .",
    "dipoles are the preferred primary element for the simplicity and ease of deployment , but also magnetic loop antennas and tripoles are possible options . since the moon s surface is a much better insulator than the earth s , in principle",
    "the dipoles could be placed directly on the lunar surface , without a defined ground plane @xcite .    to keep data rates for earth - moon telemetry manageable ( details below ) , an array with a large number of elements",
    "requires a correlator to be placed on the moon . for the deployment of a large number of antennas ,",
    "@xcite have considered printing of antennas onto very thin foil that can be rolled out by astronauts . however , for a smaller number of dipoles robotic deployment by rovers or even simple ballistic ejection mechanism seem to be sufficient .",
    "a major concern is the power supply to individual antenna elements .",
    "this has to be achieved either locally , through small solar cells and batteries for some fractional night operation , or through wire connections to a central solar power generator .",
    "the limited capacity of current rechargeable batteries is a major limitation for any night operation .",
    "day - time operation has always the danger of being affected by strong interference from the sun and the lunar ionosphere at the very longest wavelengths .",
    "a second challenge is the data connection between the individual elements and the central data processor ( `` correlator '' ) on the moon , where the data streams from all antennas have to be correlated with each other , and the connection between the correlator and the ground station on earth . for 10mhz",
    "bandwidth and 8-bit digitization at 20ms / s a connection of @xmath268 mbit / sec is needed . rather than digitizing the radio waves at the dipoles and risking self - generated interference",
    ", it may be preferable to carry out the digitization close to the correlator . for this",
    ", the analog radio signal could be modulated onto a laser or a glass fibre connection . due to the curvature of the moon and its rocky nature",
    ", laser connections will only work over a limited distance .",
    "wireless radio communication at high frequencies could also be considered , but this option is disfavored as it would disturb the radio - quiet nature of the site .",
    "the data rate demands between the correlator and earth are much less than the intra - lunar connections , but have to go through a relay satellite for a location on the far side .",
    "the data correlator itself does not appear to be a fundamental problem .",
    "modern general - purpose field programmable gate arrays ( fpga)-based correlators ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are already able to integrate the cross - correlation of 30 antennas with 10 mhz bandwidth essentially on a single chip .",
    "the low frequency end of the electromagnetic spectrum is currently not well - explored , and the very - low frequency end is indeed one of the last portions of the electromagnetic spectrum to remain terra incognita in astrophysics .",
    "a lunar low - frequency array would therefore enable pioneering observations in a number of scientific areas ( tab .",

    "<S> low - frequency radio astronomy is limited by severe ionospheric distortions below 50mhz and complete reflection of radio waves below 1030 mhz . </S>",
    "<S> shielding of man - made interference from long - range radio broadcasts , strong natural radio emission from the earth s aurora , and the need for setting up a large distributed antenna array make the lunar far side a supreme location for a low - frequency radio array . </S>",
    "<S> a number of new scientific drivers for such an array , such as the study of the dark ages and epoch of reionization , exoplanets , and ultra - high energy cosmic rays , have emerged and need to be studied in greater detail . here </S>",
    "<S> we review the scientific potential and requirements of these new scientific drivers and discuss the constraints for various lunar surface arrays . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we describe observability constraints imposed by the interstellar and interplanetary medium , calculate the achievable resolution , sensitivity , and confusion limit of a dipole array using general scaling laws , and apply them to various scientific questions .    of particular interest for a lunar array </S>",
    "<S> are studies of the earliest phase of the universe which are not easily accessible by other means . </S>",
    "<S> these are the _ epoch of reionization _ at redshifts z=6 - 20 , during which the very first stars and galaxies ionized most of the originally neutral intergalactic hydrogen , and the _ dark ages _ prior to that .    </S>",
    "<S> for example , a global 21-cm wave absorption signature from primordial hydrogen in the dark ages at @xmath050 could in principle be detected by a single dipole in an eternally dark crater on the moon , but foreground subtraction would be extremely difficult . obtaining a high - quality power spectrum of density fluctuations in the epoch of reionization at @xmath130 , providing a wealth of cosmological data , would require about @xmath2@xmath3 antenna elements on the moon , which appears not unreasonable in the long term . moreover , </S>",
    "<S> baryonic acoustic oscillations in the dark ages at z=30 - 50 could similarly be detected , thereby providing pristine cosmological information , e.g. , on the inflationary phase of the universe .    with a large array </S>",
    "<S> also exoplanet magnetospheres could be detected through jupiter - like coherent bursts . </S>",
    "<S> smaller arrays of order @xmath4 antennas over @xmath5 100 km , which could already be erected robotically by a single mission with current technology and launchers , could tackle surveys of steep - spectrum large - scale radio structures from galaxy clusters and radio galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> also , at very low frequencies the structure of the interstellar medium can be studied tomographically . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , radio emission from neutrino interactions within the moon can potentially be used to create a neutrino detector with a volume of several cubic kilometers . an ultra - high energy cosmic ray detector with thousands of square kilometre area for cosmic ray energies </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6ev could in principle be realized with some hundred antennas .    in any case , </S>",
    "<S> pathfinder arrays are needed to test the feasibility of these experiments in the not too distant future . </S>",
    "<S> lunar low - frequency arrays are thus a timely option to consider , offering the potential for significant new insights into a wide range of today s crucial scientific topics . </S>",
    "<S> this would open up one of the last unexplored frequency domains in the electromagnetic spectrum .    </S>",
