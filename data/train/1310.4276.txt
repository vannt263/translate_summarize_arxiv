    "since the relativistic laser - plasma interaction was first investigated by akhiezer and polovin @xcite , many nonlinear phenomena have been found , such as solitons , vortices , double layers and so on .",
    "in particular the discovery of electromagnetic solitary waves have attracted the attention of many people due to its robust and resilient behaviors @xcite . in past decades",
    "many works have been performed in conventional electron - ion ( ei ) plasma @xcite . on the other hand , there exists also electron - positron - ion ( epi ) plasma in most astrophysical environments and in the laboratory @xcite , for example , in the pulsar magnetosphere @xcite , the active galactic nuclei @xcite , and the early universe @xcite .",
    "recently the studies of nonlinear waves in the intense laser field interacting with epi plasma have revealed some new features @xcite .",
    "usually the epi plasma is very different from the conventional ei plasma and also different from the pure electron - positron ( ep ) plasma @xcite .",
    "an obvious fact is that there is no soliton solutions for pure ep plasma because the charge density cancels each other for charge neutralized electrons and positrons .",
    "let us recall some researches that have been done about the localized solitary wave solutions in two - component plasma , ei or / and ep , and three - component plasma , epi .",
    "farina and bulanov @xcite studied the relativistic electromagnetic solitons in ei and ep plasma . in our previous study we obtained the parameter region of existence of solitons and the bifurcation diagram for ei plasma @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the relativistic solitary waves in cold ep plasma in an external magnetic field .",
    "they also found the large amplitude envelope solitons analytically in epi plasma @xcite . by using the reductive perturbation method , mahmood _ et al . _",
    "@xcite obtained the small amplitude korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) soliton solutions in hot epi plasma and they also considered the influence of temperature ratio of electrons to positrons on solitons .",
    "@xcite studied the manifolds of periodic solutions by poincar section plots , they found that the ion dynamic strongly affect the structure of the phase plot and the ion motion must not be neglected in the high - intensity regime .",
    "some other works are also done , such as the studies of ion - arouse solitary waves @xcite and vortices @xcite in epi plasma .",
    "the propose of this paper is to investigate solitary waves in the cold and unmagnetized epi plasma .",
    "we will focus on three important aspects .",
    "first we have to choose a set of parameters which are relatively practical and physical by the requirement of approximated wave dispersion .",
    "it is noted that this point is always either omitted or less discussed in many publications before .",
    "second we employ the numerical technique to solve the coupling equations of envelop of laser field and potential of plasma electrostatic field , which can provide an exact solitary wave solution .",
    "third we generalize the approximate perturbation analytic method developed by others @xcite for immobile ion case to the case including the ion motion .",
    "motivated by these factors , we study both cases of mobile and immobile ions .",
    "the numerical results are compared to the analytical ones .",
    "we also hope that our results in this paper are helpful to clarify the properties of nonlinear solitary waves in epi plasma . before giving the exact numerical solutions , we have made a detailed stability analysis for fixed point of the system and the parameter region for the existence of solitary waves , like in ref .",
    "@xcite , which can give relatively a deeper understanding of nonlinear coherent structure in multi - component plasma .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii reviews the theoretical model of laser - plasma interaction for completeness of paper , and presents the parameter region that solitary waves may exist analytically in terms of nonlinear dynamics method .",
    "section iii exhibits the exact numerical solutions in both cases of mobile and immobile ions . and",
    "the numerical results are compared to the approximate analytical solutions .",
    "a conclusion is given in sec .",
    "finally the derivation of analytical method by perturbation series expansion technique generalized to the mobile ion case is given in appendix .",
    "the basic formalism of studied problem is certainly from the maxwell equations and hydrodynamic equations . in the following the involving physical quantities are normalized as time @xmath0 , length @xmath1 , potential @xmath2 , electromagnetic fields @xmath3 and @xmath4 , density @xmath5 , velocity @xmath6 and momentum @xmath7 , respectively , where @xmath8 is the electron plasma frequency",
    ", @xmath9 is the electron rest mass and @xmath10 is the unperturbed electron density .",
    "charges @xmath11 are normalized to @xmath12 , where @xmath13 indicates the particle species ( @xmath14 ) , so for electron @xmath15 , for positron and ion @xmath16 , @xmath17 is defined as @xmath18 , so for electron and positron , @xmath19 , and for ion ( for simplicity we assumed it as proton ) @xmath20 .",
    "we shall consider that the system is initially an equilibrium state which is characterized by @xmath21 to ensure the charge neutrality .",
    "the positron fraction can be defined as @xmath22 , which is the ratio of positron to electron initially .    by using the normalized quantities mentioned above",
    ", the maxwell equations and hydrodynamic equations are written in the form as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the canonical momentum , @xmath25 is the relativistic factor and @xmath26 is particle fluid velocity .",
    "note that we have chosen the coulomb gauge @xmath27 .    as in most studies",
    "before , for convenience , we just consider the problem that all the quantities vary only along the direction of propagation @xmath28 .",
    "we look for the solution of vector potential as the form of @xmath29 , where the new variables @xmath30 , @xmath31 are introduced and @xmath32 is the laser group velocity . by the way the wave traveling phase velocity is just @xmath33 .    in the quasistatic approximation and the initial plasma conditions of @xmath34 at infinity",
    ", then we get the reduced coupling equations as follows @xmath35 where @xmath36 ( obviously @xmath37 ) and two auxiliary quantities are introduced as @xmath38,\\label{eq7}\\\\ \\mathcal{f}_2=\\sqrt{1-\\varepsilon^2}\\bigg[\\frac{\\psi_e}{r_e}-\\frac{\\chi\\psi_p}{r_p } -\\frac{(1-\\chi)\\psi_i}{r_i } \\bigg ] .",
    "\\label{eq8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "now eqs.([eq5 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) constitute a set of coupled ordinary differential equations ( odes ) for the vector potential of the laser pulse and wake potential of plasma , which are our starting point for further investigations in the following .",
    "we shall first discuss the nonlinear dynamics that is hidden in these equations . in order to predict the existence of the solitary waves , eqs.([eq5 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] )",
    "can be reduced to a set of one - order odes as @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , where the prime denotes as @xmath45 .",
    "the fixed points can be calculated from @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "for example , in the case of mobile ion the fixed point @xmath50 is found .",
    "it is easy to find that the characteristic roots of jacobi determinant are @xmath51/\\varepsilon^2-\\omega^2 $ ] and @xmath52/(1-\\varepsilon^2 ) $ ] .",
    "let us denote @xmath53 .",
    "obviously if @xmath54 , the characteristic roots are @xmath55/\\varepsilon^2-\\omega^2}$ ] and @xmath56/(1-\\varepsilon^2 ) } $ ] . accordingly",
    "the stability analysis mentioned above shows that the fixed point @xmath57 is a saddle - center when @xmath58 .",
    "this means that in this region there exist solitary waves .    because ions are much heavier than the electrons , so the ion motion could be neglected for simplified treatment in some situations .",
    "thus for immobile ion case , similar to the mobile ion case , the coupling equations are in the same form except @xmath59 , and with @xmath60,\\label{eq9}\\\\ & & \\mathcal{f}_4=\\sqrt{1-\\varepsilon^2}\\bigg[\\frac{\\psi_e}{r_e}-\\frac{\\chi\\psi_p}{r_p } -\\frac{(1-\\chi)}{\\sqrt{1-\\varepsilon^2 } } \\bigg ] , \\label{eq10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] replacing the former @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "similarly we find that the fixed point is also @xmath63 and the stability analysis shows that it is also the saddle - center .",
    "the solitary waves can be available in the region of @xmath64 .",
    "( color online ) solitary wave solutions of vector potential @xmath65 in ( a ) and electrostatic potential @xmath66 in ( b ) for mobile ion case .",
    "the positron fraction is @xmath67 and the other parameters are seen in text.,width=566 ]",
    "before giving numerical and analytical solutions in the following , it is necessary to see how to choose the system parameters which are important for practical physical system .",
    "it is well known that in non - relativistic frame we have the normalized laser group velocity @xmath68 for conventional ei plasma ( note that the normalized laser frequency is the ratio of real laser frequency @xmath69 to equilibrium plasma frequency @xmath70 , i.e. @xmath71 ) .",
    "this relation comes from the dispersion of transverse electromagnetic waves propagating in plasma .",
    "a further relation is that @xmath72 which will lead to @xmath73 .",
    "however in the weak relativistic frame due to the plasma mass is modified by the relativistic factor so that @xmath74 .",
    "similarly for eip plasma we have @xmath75 for both of mobile and immobile ion cases .",
    "these discussions lead to two facts .",
    "one is that indeed the practical laser and plasma parameters can lie in the region where the solitary waves can exist analyzed in the last section .",
    "the other , maybe more important , is that the production quantity @xmath53 should be near to the value of bifurcation point @xmath76 because the studied problem is the weak relativistic in which the relativistical factor @xmath77 is a little larger than @xmath78 .",
    "in fact our studies below support and confirm these analysis . for convenience",
    "we should remind that the larger parameter @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) corresponds to the higher plasma density but the smaller laser group velocity .",
    "the 4th order rung - kutta method is employed in our numerical techniques .",
    "we can find a series of numerical solitary wave solutions for eqs.([eq5 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) with different parameters of @xmath81 and @xmath82 if @xmath83 is fixed . for illustration",
    "some typical numerical results are shown in fig.[fig1 ] in mobile ion case .",
    "specifically , fig.[fig1](a ) is the envelop of vector potential @xmath65 and fig.[fig1](b ) is the electrostatic potential @xmath66 .",
    "we have chosen @xmath67 and five sets of @xmath84 and @xmath85 as @xmath86 = @xmath87 ( black line ) , @xmath88 ( red line ) , @xmath89 ( green line ) , @xmath90 ( blue line ) and @xmath91 ( cyan line ) . from the discussion mentioned above these parameters are chosen to near the bifurcation point , i.e. , @xmath92 but @xmath93 .",
    "one can clearly see that with the increase of plasma density the amplitudes of solitary waves are increased accordingly in the mobile ion case . for immobile ion case",
    ", we can get the corresponding solitary wave solutions in the same five sets of @xmath84 and @xmath85 , and the amplitudes of solitary waves increase also with the plasma density .",

    "it is found that the solitary wave amplitudes of vector potential @xmath65 and electrostatic potential @xmath66 in the mobile ion case are always larger than that in the immobile ion case under the same conditions of @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath83 .",
    "it is not surprising because only stronger laser can excite the larger plasma motion , which intrigues the larger plasma potential .",
    "this self - consistent physical picture is a typical nonlinear characteristic in laser - plasma interaction which is associated strongly to the ponderomotive of laser field as well as the electrostatic force due to plasma charge density .      in order to compare the numerical solutions to analytical results",
    "the derivation of analytical solutions is given in appendix .",
    "we get the concrete analytical expression for solitary wave solutions as eq.([eqa17 ] ) by using a similar perturbation series expansion method which has been developed by many people @xcite but the scheme and results are generalized to include the ion dynamics .",

    "meanwhile the analytical results agree with the numerical results very well for small values of @xmath79 , i.e. relatively tenuous plasma .",
    "however , as the plasma becomes dense enough , the underestimation of analytical solutions becomes more and more severe .",

    "are plotted by black solid line and red solid line , respectively .",
    "indeed the numerical results and analytical ones are almost the same because the analytical expression is valid well for the choice of parameters . on the other hand for the higher plasma density , @xmath101 , and given the other parameters as @xmath99 and @xmath102 , the corresponding numerical solutions and analytical solutions in both of mobile ion case ( upper row ) and immobile ion case ( lower row ) are shown in fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "obviously there are remarkable discrepancy between the numerical and analytical results .",
    "we think it attributes to a fact that the series expansion terms are not enough . if we take higher orders of terms in eq.([eqa4 ] ) , for example @xmath103 or @xmath104 , the analytical solutions will become more accurate which will be in accordance with the numerical ones .",
    "these observations indicate that the limiting condition eq.([eqa19 ] ) in analytical method plays an important role .",
    "the series expansion would lose its validity rapidly if the convergence condition is violated , e.g. , for the higher plasma density .",

    "one can find that as increase of @xmath83 both values of @xmath94 and @xmath95 are increased monotonously , i.e. , the ratio of positron to electron density can enhance the amplitudes of solitary waves .",

    "in a summary , in this paper , the solitary waves have been found numerically and analytically in electron - positron - ion plasma with the condition of charge neutrality initially and we have considered both cases of mobile and immobile ions . the existence of solitary wave solutions have been found analytically in a certain parameter region .",
    "we also find that when ion is mobile , compared to immobile ion , both the parameter region and the amplitudes of solitary waves become larger .",
    "in addition , the positron concentration has a significant impact on the solitary waves in the considered plasma system .",

    "we also compare the numerical results with analytical solutions , and they are almost the same except for the cases of high plasma density or / and high positron fraction .",
