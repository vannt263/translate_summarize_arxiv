    "the observable properties of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and black hole x - ray binaries ( bhxrbs ) are consequences of accretion on to a black hole at a variety of rates , in a variety of ` states ' , and within a variety of environments .",
    "the major difference between the aforementioned classes of object is the black hole mass .",
    "bhxrbs typically have a black hole mass @xmath010m@xmath5 while for agn it is @xmath6 .",
    "theoretically , the central accretion processes should be relatively straightforward to scale with mass , and this is supported by several observed correlations .",
    "these include a relation between the x - ray and radio luminosities and the black hole mass ( merloni , heinz & di matteo 2003 ; falcke , krding & markoff 2004 ) , and between x - ray variability timescales , mass accretion rate and mass ( mchardy et al .",
    "more quantitative similarities between accretion ` states ' and radio jet production have also been demonstrated ( krding , jester & fender 2006 ; for the current picture of accretion states in bhxrbs and their relation to radio jets see fender , belloni & gallo 2004 ) .",
    "studying the delays between different emission regions gives us a further handle on the scalability of black hole accretion , as signals propagate from , for example , the accretion flow to the jet .",
    "variability studies have so far shown that a correlation exists between the x - ray and optical emitting regions of both bhxrbs and agn , typically reporting small lags , which are consistent with at least some of the optical variations being due to x - ray heating of the disc @xcite .",
    "a recent study by @xcite has shown that a correlated time lag of @xmath0 100 ms exists between the x - ray and ir regions ( ir lagging x - rays ) for the bhxrb gx339 - 4 , indicating a close coupling between the hot accretion flow and inner regions of the jet . in the case of the bhxrb grs 1915 + 105 a variable x - ray to radio lag of @xmath7 mins ( radio lagging x - ray )",
    "has been measured @xcite .",
    "discrete ejection events have been resolved in both the agn 3c120 @xcite and grs 1915 + 105 @xcite .",
    "the linear scaling with mass of the characteristic timescale around a black hole means that there are advantages to studying each class of object . in bhxrbs",
    "we can track complete outburst cycles , from the onset of disc instabilities through major ejection events , radio - quiet disc - dominated states , and a return to quiescence , on humanly - observable timescales ( typically years ) . for a typical agn",
    "the equivalent cycle may take many millions of years .",
    "however , for an agn we are able to resolve individual variations of the source on time - scales that are comparable to or shorter than the shortest physical time - scales in the system ( e.g. the dynamical time - scale ) , something which is currently impossible for bhxrbs . in ` black hole time ' we are able to observe the evolution of sources in fast - forward for bhxrbs and in detailed slow - motion for agn .    in this paper",
    "we present the results of a long term ( @xmath8 years ) regular monitoring campaign in the x - ray and radio bands of the low luminosity active galactic nucleus ( llagn ) ngc 7213 .",
    "previous x - ray studies show that ngc 7213 is accreting at a low rate @xmath9 l@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the hard state in bhxrbs is typically observed at bolometric luminosities below @xmath10 eddington , and seems to be ubiquitously associated with a quasi - steady jet . above @xmath10 , sources can switch to a softer x - ray state , the jets are suppressed @xcite ; furthermore transition to this softer state is usually associated with major transient ejection events . as ngc 7213 is considerably below l@xmath11",
    "1% we therefore consider it a good candidate for comparison with other bhxrbs in the low / hard state .",
    "if we consider agn to be ` scaled up ' versions of bhxrbs by exploring the time lag between the x - ray and radio emitting regions we can compare , contrast and hopefully relate the accretion and jet production scenarios for agn and bhxrbs .    a correlation has been established by @xcite and gallo et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2006 ) relating the radio luminosity ( @xmath12 ) and x - ray luminosity ( @xmath13 ) for bhxrbs in the low / hard and quiescent states , where @xmath14 .",
    "@xcite - hereafter mhdm03 and @xcite extended the bhxrb relationship using two samples of agn to form the ` fundamental plane of black hole activity ' . by accounting for the black hole mass ( m ) the relationship",
    "@xmath14 has been extended to cover many orders of magnitude in black hole mass and luminosity .",
    "further refinements were made to the fundamental plane by @xcite - hereafter kfc06 , using an augmented and updated sample to examine the fitting parameters .    throughout this paper",
    "we define the ` intrinsic ' behaviour of agn and bhxrbs as multiple measurements ( in the radio and x - ray ) of the _ same _ source .",
    "we define the ` global ' behaviour as single ( or average ) measurements of _ multiple _ sources , both with respect to the fundamental plane .    for the bhxrbs in the low / hard state",
    "the relationship described above has not only been established globally but in some cases intrinsically , i.e gx 339 - 4 , v404 cyg and a small number of other systems have been shown to move up and down the correlation seen in the fundamental plane @xcite .",
    "however , in recent years an increasing number of outliers have been found below the correlation , i.e. less radio - loud then expected ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) as well as some sources which move in the plane with a different slope ( e.g @xcite ) . to date the correlation found from the fundamental plane has only been measured globally for agn , not intrinsically .",
    "note , with respect to the global measurements of the agn population , the specific measurements of the radio and x - ray flux used in the correlation are sometimes taken at different times and thus could be a source of error in the correlation @xcite .",
    "as well as establishing the time lags , another goal of this work , is to establish , through quasi - simultaneous observations the intrinsic relationship between @xmath12 , @xmath13 and m observed in an llagn and its relevance to the fundamental plane of black hole activity .",
    "we use the mhdm03 and kfc06 samples for comparison both with an updated bhxrb sample taken from fender , gallo & russell ( 2010 ) - hereafter fgr10 .",
    "we also explore the possible scatter in agn data points away from the fundamental plane and place limits on this deviation .",
    "ngc 7213 is a face - on sa galaxy hosting a seyfert 1.5 nucleus located at a distance of 25 mpc assuming h@xmath15=71kms@xmath16mpc@xmath16 .",
    "low ionisation emission lines are observable in its nuclear spectrum , also making it a member of the liner class @xcite .    the radio properties of ngc 7213 are intermediate between those of radio - loud and radio - quiet agn .",
    "previous radio studies at 8.4 ghz have not resolved any jet emission from the nucleus on scales 3 mas to 1 arcsec ( @xcite , @xcite,@xcite).the long baseline array ( lba ) is an australian six station vlbi instrument @xcite ; lba observations at 1.4 and 0.843 ghz have shown some evidence for larger scale emission that could be due to jet - fed radio lobes @xcite . however , as the nucleus remains unresolved it could be that the jet is oriented to some degree in the direction of the observer . as suggested by @xcite , the lower frequency emission",
    "could possibly be associated with a ` kink ' in the jet at a larger distance .",
    "this could be consistent with a general model proposed by @xcite where radio - intermediate objects are in fact radio -quiet objects whose jets are to some extent aligned in the observers direction and relativistically boosted .",
    "previous x - ray studies have so far failed to show significant evidence for a soft x - ray excess ; compton reflection ; or a broad fe k@xmath17 line in the ngc 7213 spectrum e.g. see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . a narrow fe k@xmath17 line is observed and @xcite show evidence that it is produced in the broad line region ( blr ) .",
    "@xcite also report that the expected uv bump is either absent or extremely weak .",
    "the weakness or absence of these signatures suggests that the inner accretion disc is missing , perhaps replaced by an advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) ( as suggested by @xcite ) or similar hot flow , consistent with the low / hard state interpretation of ngc  7213 .",
    "@xcite estimate the black hole mass of ngc 7213 using the nuclear velocity dispersion calculation of @xcite and the velocity - dispersion versus black - hole - mass relationship of @xcite to obtain @xmath18 .",
    "bi - weekly monitoring was obtained with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) .",
    "the interferometer setup was such that 128 channels of 1 mhz bandwidth were used to form two continuum channels centred at 4.8 and 8.4 ghz respectively .",
    "the radio observations have been reduced using the miriad radio reduction package @xcite .",
    "flux and bandpass calibration was achieved using ( in most cases ) pks j1939 - 6342 ( b1934 - 638 ) and for the phase calibration pks j2218 - 5038 ( b2215 - 508 ) .    a variety of fitting techniques",
    "were then tested to extract the flux density of the source from the observations . these included testing point and gaussian fitting to the source in the image and uv plane .",
    "as atca is an east - west array and observations were short in duration ( @xmath02 hours ) an elongated synthesised beam was typically produced .",
    "image - plane fitting often failed to converge and/or produced non - physical results .",
    "therefore fitting was discarded in the image plane for the more reliable uv plane method .",
    "the final radio light curves and spectral indexes ( between the radio bands only ) are shown in figure [ lightcurve ] .    to complement the snapshot observations a full 12 hour integration was performed on 2008 june 29",
    "; the purpose of which was to explore the polarisation properties of the jet , and to detect any faint extended structure .",
    "additional steps were taken to ensure adequate polarisation calibration was performed .",
    "this observation was also used to make a deep image of the source ; beyond the 0.5@xmath19 beam no weak extended radio emission was observed above a noise level @xmath20=78@xmath21j at 4.8 ghz .",
    "daily monitoring was obtained using 1  ksec snapshots obtained with the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) proportional counter array ( pca ) , allowing a long - term light curve to be obtained in the 2 - 10 kev band .",
    "the data were reduced using ftools v6.8 , using standard extraction methods and acceptance criteria .",
    "the background was calculated from the most recent background models which corrects for the recent problems with the @xmath22 saa ( south atlantic anomaly ) history file .",
    "the final 2 - 10 kev fluxes were calculated by fitting a power law to the observed spectra .",
    "this allows us to take into account changes in the instrumental gain over the duration of the monitoring .",

    "figure [ lightcurve ] shows x - ray flux ( top panel ) , radio flux ( middle panels ) and radio spectral index @xmath17 where @xmath25 ( bottom panel ) versus time .",
    "the x - ray light curve shows a general decrease in flux until mjd 54600 .",
    "two distinct x - ray flares are observed at mjd 53920 and mjd 54390 , both appear to be correlated with events in the radio bands .",
    "we use the discrete correlation function ( dcf ) method of @xcite to calculate the cross - correlation coefficients between the entire x - ray and radio bands to find the lag . to calculate the centroid lag @xmath26 , we use a weighted mean of the positive lags above an 85% threshold of the peak dcf value .",
    "we use @xmath26 , rather than the peak value @xmath27 , because the centroid has been shown to better represent the physical lag @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that it is difficult to interpret @xmath27 as a physical quantity , and if it is used to calculate the lag , it usually offers an underestimate when compared with @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the centroid width is calculated as    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the long term radio variability at 8.4 ghz is plotted in the lower panel of figure [ archiveplot ] . the flux values were taken from a variety of instruments and publications ( which are referenced on the plot ) . in order of increasing time the first point on the plot was taken from @xcite using the parkes - tidbindilla interferometer ( pti ) .",
    "then near simultaneous data points were taken with the vla @xcite and then atca @xcite .",
    "the flux from the long baseline array ( lba ) observation by @xcite was the last point plotted prior to the atca monitoring which is presented in this paper .",
    "when comparing the flux expected from the start of our atca monitoring with the lba data point , the lba point seems too low .",
    "the core is un - resolved with all of the radio telescopes described above .",
    "the pti observations constitutes the first data point in figure [ archiveplot ] and the lba the last ( before atca monitoring ) .",
    "note , the parkes - tidbindilla baseline is part of the lba network .",
    "@xcite comment that in the lba observations , no decrease in flux was observed with respect to baseline length i.e it was not resolved ; they conclude from this that the decrease in flux with respect to the other observations is accurate .",
    "however , both the pti and the lba are not sensitive to the same spatial resolutions as the vla and atca ( the largest atca baseline is 6 km and the shortest lba baseline used in the archival observation is 113 km ) .",
    "it is possible that some flux ( on atca equivalent baselines ) is not accounted for : which could plausibly give a decrease in flux i.e indicating brighter , larger scale structure .",
    "the logical consequence of this is that the pti data point is also missing some flux as it samples on a singular baseline of 275 km .",
    "we will discuss these measurements within the context of the fundamental plane and attempt to draw some conclusions in section 5.2      a full 12 hour synthesis atca observation was performed on 2008 june 29 at 8.4 and 4.8 ghz .",
    "the purpose of this observation was to perform a reliable polarisation calibration to ascertain an accurate measurement of the percentage linear polarised ( lp ) flux from the source .",
    "@xcite showed that from a sample of 11 llagn the mean lp was @xmath28 .",
    "@xcite from a survey of 22 blazars report a mean lp @xmath29 with a standard deviation @xmath30 . at the time of observation",
    "the polarisation of ngc 7213 was @xmath31 at 4.8 and 8.4 ghz respectively , which is more consistent with the reported value of typical llagn and not blazars .",
    "the percentage polarisation was calculated at other epochs , however without a full 12 hour synthesis parallactic angle calibration the values were often suspect and will not be presented here .",
    "we have shown that a weak but statistically significant delay exists between the x - ray and radio emitting regions , with the radio lagging behind the x - ray .",
    "a number of models have been proposed to explain and interpret the x - ray to radio lag in both bhxrbs and agn .",
    "the most notable of these are the ` internal shock model ' @xcite and a ` plasmon model ' @xcite .",
    "we will briefly explore these models and comment on the relevance - if any - to our data .",
    "we first consider a plasmon model .",
    "after the accretion mechanism(s ) have pushed matter into the jet , an adiabatically expanding initially self - absorbed synchrotron emitting plasmon travels at relativistic speeds down the path of the jet . at a given time and",
    "frequency the matter becomes optically thin and is ` detectable ' at that given frequency ( in this case either 8.4 and 4.8 ghz ) .",
    "if the jet is fed at a constant mass rate , density and velocity the delay time for material to become optically thin will be constant .",
    "if these parameters are not constant the delay between x - ray and radio will be variable ( e.g. see @xcite ) assuming that the disk and the jet are indeed coupled @xcite .",
    "note , the higher frequency radio emission ( 8.4 ghz ) will become optically thin first , thus a delay from 8.4 to 4.8 ghz is always expected .",
    "another model for explaining the emission seen in jets is the ` internal shock model ' @xcite .",
    "the synchrotron lifetime of an emitting region is too short to adequately explain the scales of jets observered in agn .",
    "these emitting regions - commonly referred to as ` knots ' - are often displaced from the central core emission .",
    "localised shocks within these regions are needed to explain the time - scales of variation observed @xcite .",
    "jet shock scenarios have also been used to model the common flat spectrum jet observered in bhxrbs and agn ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ lightcurve ] shows the evolution of spectral index ; indicating that during a flare event @xmath17 increases ( @xmath32 ) , flattens and steepens ( @xmath33 ) shortly afterwards .",
    "the initial re - energisation given by a shock would push / compress the plasma into the optically thick regime ; subsequently this process moves the material into the optically thin regime .",
    "the variable time lag seen in the dcf could be interpreted as the time taken for newly injected matter to ` catch up ' with older matter expanding adiabatically in the jet to shock and produce a flare .",
    "the lag would be dependent on the lorentz factor of the newly injected material which in turn is related to the accretion rate @xcite .",
    "although both of these models can adequately explain the variations observed in our light curves , we can not completely disentangle them .",
    "it is possible that both of these models are in some part responsible for the behaviour .",
    "as the jet remains unresolved we can not identify an area of localised shocks or indeed discrete resolved events that we could use to support a particular model .",
    "to explore - in a very simplistic sense - how the time lags seen in bhxrbs scale up to agn we offer two comparisons ; that of a simple mass scaling and also mass - eddington ratio scaling .",
    "for example , discrete resolved ejection events have been seen in grs 1915 + 105 with a variable time lag between x - ray and radio ( ghz ) , with the clearest examples of events having lags of @xmath34 20 - 30 mins @xcite .",
    "taking the characteristic timescale of x - ray - radio lags measured in grs 1915 + 105 and scaling up to ngc 7213 with mass only ( assuming the mass of grs 1915 + 105 as @xmath0 10m@xmath5 and the mass of ngc 7213 as 9.6 @xmath35m@xmath5 and using @xmath36 ) we infer @xmath37 2 @xmath38 days , much longer than we observe .",
    "grs 1915 + 105 is however accreting at a much higher rate , therefore including a scaling by the ratio of the eddington luminosities ( using @xmath39 and taking @xmath40 ) we find @xmath41 140 days , reasonably comparable to our measured lag .    the difficulty in comparing the actual x - ray - radio time lag measured for ngc 7213 , and that of the grs 1915 + 105 scaled time lag is that the radio emitting regions being probed are significantly different : in a broader view the spectral energy distributions are different .",
    "in fact until the structure of jets and how it scales with accretion rate and mass at a given frequency are better understood , such attempts at quantitative comparison are of marginal value , although the qualitative comparison is valuable .",
    "the fundamental plane of black hole activity @xcite shows that the correlation @xmath42 holds over many orders of magnitude of x - ray and radio luminosities , and black hole masses .",
    "figure [ full_plane ] shows ; at high luminosities a sample of agn taken from mhdm03 , and at the low luminosities an updated bhxrb sample taken from fgr10 . the updated bhxrb x - ray data were observed in the 0.5 - 10 kev energy range , therefore careful steps were taken ( using webpimms ) to correctly convert into the 2 - 10 kev range to compare with the mhdm03 and ngc 7213 data points .",
    "we plot on figure [ full_plane ] the best fit parameters @xmath43 log @xmath44 log @xmath45 as defined by mhdm03 .",
    "note , we do not re - fit the best fit line for the updated bhxrb sample .",
    "we paired the x - ray and radio data points to calculate the correlation by finding the closest x - ray point ( in time ) , to the radio , because the x - ray sampling was more frequent .",
    "the average for ngc 7213 sits well on the predicted correlation .",
    "the right hand panel of figure [ full_plane ] shows a close up of the ngc 7213 data .",
    "a least squared best fit for the ngc 7213 data points only is shown and parametrised by @xmath46 log @xmath47 ( the constant includes the mass term in the context of mhdm03 ) .",
    "we include in figure [ full_plane ] the correlation found from the archival x - ray and radio data ; however , as they were not simultaneous we do not include them in the best fit .",
    "we paired the x - ray and radio data points to calculate the correlation according to the closest in time .",
    "if either two x - ray , or two radio points were very close in time , both are included in the correlation . also note that these data were calculated between 8.4 ghz and 2 - 10 kev and not 4.8 ghz . assuming that the same correlation ( i.e @xmath0 flat spectrum ) holds between the 8.4 and 4.8 ghz observations the plot seems to show that two of the archival points do not follow the trend predicted by the fundamental plane .    to assess whether the deviation / scatter in the archival points ( and indeed the other mhdm03 agn ) away from the fundamental plane can be explained due to a delay in sampling the x - ray and radio fluxes",
    "; we take the fraction rms scatter in the rxte / atca x - ray and radio data and plot this errorbar with the archival points .",
    "we find the fractional x - ray rms to be @xmath48=26% and the fractional radio rms @xmath49=11% .",
    "the full light curve presented in this paper spans @xmath0 1000 days and the longest change in time between the archival observations is @xmath0 500 days ( see table [ achival_table ] ) .",
    "although this method only offers an estimate of the error between sampled data points , it does allow us to assess outliers .    within this framework",
    "it appears that the first ( pti correlation ) and last ( lba correlation ) data points that were used in the correlation are outliers : the atca and vla correlation points sit close to the best fit .",
    "even when taking into account the full rms from the 1000 day light curve the error bars do not bring the data points close to the mhdm03 best fit .",
    "we have also speculated earlier that there could be a certain amount of missing flux associated with these long baseline observations . moving both the pti and lba points up by some set amount will still leave the pti point away from the correlation .",
    "although applying the intrinsic variation of the source to the archival points can not bring all points onto or close to the correlation ; the scatter in these points is within that permitted by the other mhdm03 points shown on the plot .    by using the fractional rms of x - ray and radio variability from our study",
    "we have placed a constraint in the deviation of the archival data points away from the fundamental plane .",
    "these constraints suggest that other forms of scatter ( apart from bad sampling and missing flux ) could be affecting the data . as summarised in kfc06 other forms of scatter",
    "could be attributed to beaming , source peculiarities and spectral energy distribution - but note , these should remain relatively constant for the @xmath50 source .    in figure [ kfc ]",
    "we plot a llagn @xmath51 sample and best fit parameters taken from kfc06 with the updated bhxrb sample .",
    "note , the x - ray data in the kfc06 sample are taken in the 1 - 10 kev band . as the ngc 7213",
    "data points are in the 2 - 10 kev band we assume a photon index of @xmath52=1.8 and add a correction factor to the ngc 7213 data points to make them comparable . we apply a similar correction to the bhxrb sample . from this plot",
    "it is clear that the ngc 7213 data points are positioned slightly above the best fit line .",
    "considering the postion of ngc 7213 on the fundamental plane with respect to other llagn ( see figure 6 ) , we calculate its radio loudness parameter to assess the differentiation .",
    "we calculate the radio loudness parameter @xmath53 ( where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the radio and optical luminosities ) ; we use a @xmath56 band magnitude of 16.3 , and find the optical flux @xmath57 using @xmath58log@xmath59 @xcite : giving @xmath60 = 134.8 . in this scheme",
    "radio - loud sources are typically defined as having an @xmath60 parameter @xmath61 10 , while radio - quite range between 0.1 - 1 @xcite .    using the alternative radio loudness parameter of @xcite which utilises the x - ray instead of optical luminosity , @xmath62",
    ", we find log@xmath63 -3.28 .",
    "@xcite show that for a sample of low - luminosity seyfert galaxies log@xmath64 while for a sample of low - luminosity radio galaxies ( llrgs ) log@xmath65 . therefore , with respect to the x - ray radio loudness , ngc 7213 is only slightly higher than that of a sample of low - luminosity seyfert galaxies ; while under the standard definition of radio loudness it is indeed radio loud .",
    "these results are consistent with the position of ngc 7213 on figure [ kfc ] .    as was discussed earlier in this paper there is an apparent time lag between events in the x - ray and radio .",
    "therefore comparing the fitting parameters found from the ngc 7213 data with the mhdm03 relationship without correcting for the lag might give rise to errors as we are not matching the correct data points .",
    "the width in the cross - correlation peaks shows that the time lag is variable .",
    "thus , for example , the two radio flares could have different lag times associated with them . therefore shifting the entire radio light curve back by a set amount to match the x - ray",
    "could still give a scatter . to simplify this problem we separated out the data for the first flare only because we have a more accurate measurement of the lag in this specific case .",
    "we then shifted the radio data -35 days which was the time lag measured for this singular flare using the dcf at 4.8 ghz ( see table [ lag_table ] ) .",
    "the top panel of figure [ shifted ] shows the uncorrected data on the mhdm03 plot while the middle panel shows the corrected data ; for completeness the bottom panel shows all radio data points shifted back .",
    "for the first flare correcting the data appears to reduce the scatter and increase the gradient more in line with the mhdm03 best fit .",
    "it is now described by @xmath66 log @xmath67 . to check the statistical significance of this we measured the gradient for a variety of shifts . from 0 - 25 days",
    "the gradient gradually steepens until it gets close to 1 ( giving a coefficient of @xmath0 0.6 ) . from 30 - 50",
    "days it plateaus @xmath0 1 and from 50 days the gradient decreases towards 0 .",
    "thus it does appear that moving the flare back by the amount given from the dcf function does seem to better represent the data with respect to the mhdm03 fit .",
    "however , it should be noted that as this is a log / log plot , measuring gradients from such a small range of values should be treated with care .",
    "it would , however , be interesting in future studies to assess the importance of this parameter .",
    "we have used the australian telescope compact array and the rossi x - ray timing explorer to conduct a long term study of agn variability in the llagn ngc 7213 .",
    "we have used the cross - correlation function to show that a complex and weakly significant correlated behaviour exists between the x - ray and radio emitting regions .",
    "although the statistics only show a weak correlation , this study is the first definitive campaign to probe this type of behaviour .",
    "we have shown that ngc 7213 sits well on the predicted fundamental plane of black hole activity plot when compared with the mhdm03 sample .",
    "however we have shown that when comparing ngc 7213 with a revised bhxrb and llagn sample that the data points are above the expected correlation ; which is however consistent with the calculated radio and x - ray loudness parameters . we have also shown some support that by correcting for the time lag between events in x - ray and radio the gradient of data points agree better with the best fit derived from the mhdm03 sample on the fundamental plane .",

    "<S> we present the results of a @xmath0 3 year campaign to monitor the low luminosity active galactic nucleus ( llagn ) ngc 7213 in the radio ( 4.8 and 8.4 ghz ) and x - ray bands ( 2 - 10 kev ) . with a reported x - ray eddington ratio of @xmath1 l@xmath2 , ngc 7213 </S>",
    "<S> can be considered to be comparable to a hard state black hole x - ray binary . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a weak correlation exists between the x - ray and radio light curves . </S>",
    "<S> we use the cross - correlation function to calculate a global time lag between events in the x - ray and radio bands to be 24 @xmath3 12 days lag ( 8.4 ghz radio lagging x - ray ) , and 40 @xmath3 13 days lag ( 4.8 ghz radio lagging x - ray ) . </S>",
    "<S> the radio - radio light curves are extremely well correlated with a lag of 20.5 @xmath3 12.9 days ( 4.8 ghz lagging 8.4 ghz ) . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the previously established scaling relationship between core radio and x - ray luminosities and black hole mass @xmath4 , known as the ` fundamental plane of black hole activity ' , and show that ngc 7213 lies very close to the best - fit ` global ' correlation for the plane as one of the most luminous llagn . with a large number of quasi - simultaneous radio and x - ray observations , we explore for the first time the variations of a single agn with respect to the fundamental plane . </S>",
    "<S> although the average radio and x - ray luminosities for ngc 7213 are in good agreement with the plane , we show that there is intrinsic scatter with respect to the plane for the individual data points .    </S>",
